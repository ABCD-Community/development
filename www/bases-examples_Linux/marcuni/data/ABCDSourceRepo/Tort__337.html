</p>
<p> Foreword
</p>
<p>This volume contains the English version of the second part of the &raquo; Basic Ques-
tions of Tort Law &laquo; project, which was financed by the Austrian Science Fund 
( Fonds zur F&ouml;rderung der wis senschaftlichen Forschung, FWF ). While the first volume  
&raquo; Ba sic Questions of Tort Law from a Germanic Perspective &laquo; ( 2012 ) discussed the 
basic questions from the perspective of German-speaking countries, this second 
volume provides the responses to these discussions from representatives of seven 
legal systems, as well as comparative conclusions. In selecting the seven legal sys-
tems, care was taken to ensure that the European legal families were represented; 
since the Eastern Members of the European Union, on the one hand, are not a unit 
in this sense and, on the other hand, offer the most recent codifications, two legal 
systems from this region were chosen. The USA supplies an influential source of 
ideas and its common law departs considerably from the common law found in 
Europe; therefore, it made sense to include it. Japanese law, in turn, is taken as 
an Asian counterweight, which in this case is of especial interest to Europe as it 
contains European ideas interwoven tightly with independent developments. The 
diversity of the legal systems selected provided a broad basis for comparative law 
discussions yet at the same time maintained a feasible range. 
</p>
<p>The national particularities are also reflected in the approach taken by the 
country reporters: the presentation and style of arguments are very different and 
this helps give the reader insights into the ideas behind the respective legal sys-
tems. Readiness to discuss the ideas presented in the first volume in detail is by 
no means uniform, thus also displaying cultural differences. Drafting the com-
parative conclusions was of course considerably more difficult given the great  
variety displayed by the country reports, but this undoubtedly made it much more 
interesting; it meant, however, that the individual legal systems were not always 
given the same degree of consideration. This inequality was, moreover, increased 
by the fact that not all reports could be analysed at the same time: some reports 
unfortunately arrived later than planned and due to the significant delays, work 
on the comparative conclusions had to begin before all of the country reports 
were delivered in order to keep the delay in completing the project within an  
acceptable timeframe.
</p>
<p>In the comparative conclusions, I have tried to include ideas from the legal 
systems represented in the study and find starting points for the discussion on 
the further development of the legal systems and their harmonisation. In the  
final concluding remarks it was of course impossible to go into all the valuable

<p>ideas presented in the country reports or indeed into all of the important basic 
questions. Thus, the selection of issues discussed in more detail may seem some-
what arbitrary; however, above all I tried to pick up on ideas that as yet have not 
been discussed very often and relate to basic questions &ndash; legal policy included. 
The country reports contain many more treasures, waiting to be discovered by 
comparative law scholars and theorists. 
</p>
<p>The ideas for discussion which I present are directed not only to those who 
work towards aligning laws, but also to legislators, courts and academics at na-
tional level, with the aim of promoting continued national developments and also 
a gradual convergence of legal systems from within. I am convinced that the com-
prehensive, thought-provoking country reports will also supply a rich source for 
the work of lawyers working in the field of comparative law. 
</p>
<p>It must be noted that this volume always refers to the English version of the 
&raquo; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Ger manic Perspective &laquo;, as this served as the 
basis for the project. I also want to emphasise that the comparative conclusions, 
despite their length, are of course by no means capable of reproducing the con-
tents of the detailed country reports either fully or even adequately. In order to 
gain real insight into the individual legal systems and their framework of ideas, it 
is therefore imperative to read the country reports. 
</p>
<p>It was only possible to realise this project due to the help of many others. 
Thanks are due first to the Austrian Science Fund ( Fonds zur F&ouml;rde rung der wissen- 
schaftlichen  Forschung ), which provided the necessary funding. Then of course 
hearty thanks are due above all to the country reporters, who undertook so much 
to break into the rather foreign system of the German legal family and who fre-
quently had to struggle with their already excessive workloads while writing their 
responses. I owe much gratitude to my staff at the European Centre of Tort and 
Insurance Law, Edina Busch-T&oacute;th, Donna Stockenhuber, Kathrin Karner-Strobach 
and Vanessa Wilcox, for their reliable and dedicated handling of the project and 
the manuscript; Ms Vanessa Wilcox was also kind enough to produce the index. 
Special thanks also go to Ms Fiona Salter-Townshend for her competent transla-
tions of the Japanese report and the comparative conclusions. The publisher, Jan 
Sramek, and his team have once again executed the publication so intensively and 
professionally that it was a pleasure to work with them.

</p>
<p>I. The victim&rsquo;s own risk and shifting of the damage
</p>
<p>The idea that everyone must bear his own general risk of life might appear in 
philosophical literature but not as the starting point of a commentary on French 
tort law. No French book dealing with tort law would start by saying that, in prin-
ciple, the victim of damage must bear the consequences of it. Classical studies 
feature an actor-based approach: I am liable only when at fault, when having done 
something wrong or illicit ( neminem laedere ). Planiol started directly with fault 
( faute ) and went on to cover cases of no-fault based liability. However, he also 
wrote: &raquo; Since fault is an act contrary to law ( illicit ) an important consequence re-
sults: if I have the right to do a given act, I am not at fault for having accomplished 
it; and if I have the right to abstain, I am not at fault for having omitted to do so. It 
follows that I owe nothing to anybody; no matter what damage any action or inac-
tion may have caused to another &laquo;1. Simply turn this around and it is another way 
of saying that, as a rule, victims must bear their own losses.
</p>
<p>Koziol writes: &raquo; However, it is apparent that in today&rsquo;s society there is an in-
creased perception &ndash; fuelled by certain unrealistic political &rsaquo;land of milk and 
honey&lsaquo; delusions &ndash; that the individual can be cocooned away from all risks; that 
someone else is always responsible for any damage the individual suffers, and

<p>thus each victim&rsquo;s loss must always be covered. However, this overlooks the unde-
niable fact that compensation to the victim does not eliminate the damage from 
existence but merely passes it on to someone else, hence the damage is merely 
shifted and someone else suffers a loss by having to cover it &laquo;2.
</p>
<p>This is certainly true from a pure tort law perspective although, at the end 
of the day, much of the damage ultimately stays with the victim. However, when 
torts intersect with insurance and socialisation of risk, we may talk about shift-
ing the cost of compensation, the damage remaining with the victim. The insured 
risk is diluted to be borne by all those insured, including the compensated victim. 
The same applies to social security with the socialisation of risks. As to the &raquo; land 
of milk and honey &laquo; delusion, the French are convinced that society works better 
when its members agree to share and equalise the burden of risk and adopt a soli-
darity model. This is a political choice that has proved sustainable at least in the 
past generation or two. Writing this does not involve condoning all excesses of 
French tort law, which will be pinpointed in the pages to come.
</p>
<p>Contemporary ideas have developed the concept that bodily integrity and 
some other personal interests, such as property rights and personality rights, 
must be guaranteed. This victim-based approach3 has pushed towards the devel-
opment of strict liability, which invaded many areas of French law in the 20th cen-
tury, for instance when the damage in question is caused by a thing or in case of 
road traffic accidents, to cite the most famous examples.
</p>
<p>Meantime, the generalisation of universal social security coverage makes it 
possible for every victim of an accidental personal injury to access free or inex-
pensive medical care, not leaving a great deal of damage uncompensated. The 
fact that social security may recover against a tortfeasor is largely a matter of in-
difference to the victim, who receives minimal compensation anyway. Also, most 
belongings are protected by first-party insurance, third-party insurance, or a com-
bination of both, recourse actions by insurance companies being invisible to the 
victim. To say that, as a rule, victims must bear their own losses is certainly true 
in tort law, but looking at things from the broader perspective of compensation of 
victims, it seems that in France the principle tends to become the exception.
</p>
<p>Civil liability is not perceived as a restriction of liberty of action, France having 
largely moved from retributive justice to distributive justice. The self-proclaimed 
pays des droits de l&rsquo;homme ( country of human rights ) has become a pays des droits 
acquis ( a land of entitlements ). It is widely accepted that a portion of insurance 
premiums feed compensation funds for victims of uninsured car drivers, insolvent

<p>criminal offenders or terrorists, and that the compensation of victims of disasters 
is a matter of national solidarity4.
</p>
<p>Tort law is not seen as having the prevention of damage as its primary aim5. 
Though not denied to tort law, this preventive function tends to be associated 
with criminal law. The tightening of strict liability for road traffic accidents by 
the law of 1985 may result in the severely drunk pedestrian collapsing on the road 
being compensated by the careful driver ( naturally at the expense of his insur-
ance, meaning at all the expense of all likewise insured ). However, speed limits 
are strictly enforced, driving under intoxication is severely punished, and road in-
frastructure has greatly improved, causing the number of fatalities and the dam-
age caused by automobile accidents to drop dramatically, making French roads 
safer than they have ever been, in spite of ever-increasing traffic.
</p>
<p>II.  An insurance-based solution instead of  
liability law ?
</p>
<p>Universal insurance coverage does not necessarily induce carelessness. With the 
system of bonus-malus imposed by the Code des assurances, reckless drivers end 
up paying significantly higher premiums, whilst a careful driver with no accident 
liability on record may see his or her premium reduced by half. Flood victims 
may be compensated and yet the uninsured deductible will go up after every sub-
sequent flood until local authorities adopt a prevention of risk plan, creating an 
incentive for residents to move to safer grounds or to pressure the local authori-
ties to dredge the river or improve the levee system6. Similar rules exist to limit or 
exclude insurance coverage for those who build in special danger zones in case of 
technological disaster7.
</p>
<p>True, social security and insurance never cover the whole loss, but tort law only 
does this for the wealthy, who can afford to cushion their loss until they receive 
so-called full compensation, albeit at the cost of non-recoverable lawyers&rsquo; fees8.

</p>
<p>The French social security system may go broke, but there is no empirical evi-
dence that this will be on account of accidents. It may instead be due to a combi-
nation of maladministration and soaring medical costs. As to the insurance indus-
try, it remains a vibrant sector of French economic activity, strongly present and 
visible on the global scene, whilst premiums remain affordable for most users.
</p>
<p>Nobody in France would dispute that fair compensation of damage must com-
bine insurance and tort law solutions, and that mechanisms must be in place to 
avoid situations where victims have to wait months or years for the uncertain out-
come of a law suit to receive compensation, at least in common cases of personal 
injury and damage to property. Regarding personal injury and damage to property, 
delay in mitigating the damage is more often caused by the financial inability of 
the victim to take reasonable steps in view of suitable and timely medical treat-
ment or fixing or replacing the property. Not surprisingly, the doctrine of mitiga-
tion of damage flourishes in legal systems where social welfare is less developed. 
Though French scholars today consider it reasonable to introduce a mitigation 
of damage clause into the Civil Code9, they tend to make a personal injury excep-
tion10, which is not surprising given the existing solidarity system in place. From 
a law and economics perspective, affording victims immediate and full medical 
care is a way to mitigate the overall cost of accidents, which are in any case inevi-
table in any form of society and the costs of which tend to soar when proper care 
is not given at the right moment.
</p>
<p>Observed from a purely tort law perspective, the French system may look un-
reasonable to many. These paragraphs try to project a holistic perspective, look-
ing at the Basic Questions of Tort Law from the perspective of compensation11. 
The word compensation is a powerful term in the civil law tradition. It means the 
extinction of an obligation where two parties owe each other a similar amount of 
money. Insurance and social security mechanisms mean that people contribute a 
marginal amount of their resources to compensate or offset otherwise unbearable 
losses that might be covered as the outcome of a tort law suit but with a heavy cost, 
the time factor limiting their ability to mitigate damage. This preventive approach 
compensates or offsets ( this term being used for the common law reader ) the cost 
of damage, only leaving a marginal part that may be recovered at the cost of a law 
suit. From such a perspective, it is fair to allow the insurance industry or social se-
curity to recover by recourse action against any identified tortfeasor, as this miti-
gates the cost of the prevention system for all users.

</p>
<p>This means that from a French perspective, at least for practical purposes, 
civil liability is no longer a central but in fact a marginal mechanism. This should 
be borne in mind in any investigation of French tort law or comparative analysis.
</p>
<p>III.  Strict limits and rigid norms or fluid transitions 
and elastic rules ?
</p>
<p>In French law as in other legal systems, rigidity is not a term that could character-
ise civil liability. The view presented by Koziol that fault-based and strict liability 
are two ends of a spectrum with nuanced approaches in between12 is certainly true 
of French law, where for instance the strict liability of the party having custody 
of the damaging thing will be apportioned based on the victim&rsquo;s fault. Likewise, 
though French law seems to adopt a strict rule of non-cumul, the boundaries be-
tween contract and tort liability are far from clear, despite a tendency to have the 
law of contract prevail wherever possible13.
</p>
<p>Common law has inspired doctrines such as mitigation of damage and exem-
plary damages, which have slowly moved into French legal minds and the once 
sacrosanct norm that damages should fully compensate the victim, no more, no 
less, has given way to allow more flexibility14.
</p>
<p>France never recognised absolutely protected and unprotected rights, as the 
Civil Code never came to define the protected interest. As a rule, under the French 
Civil Code15 and provided that all other conditions for tort liability are satisfied, 
all damage is compensable whatever its kind, the concept of damage being his-
torically a very fluid notion left to be defined by the courts. The French Civil Code 
does not distinguish between different heads of damage. This would have been

</p>
<p>contrary to  Portalis&rsquo;  view that the Code should allow for social and technologi-
cal evolution, placing great trust and confidence in the judiciary16. In this respect, 
though French law tends to be portrayed as a very positivist and legicentrist sys-
tem, one should not forget that the driving force of the development of French tort 
law resides in a constant and intense dialogue between scholars and the judiciary. 
Unlike many other jurisdictions in Europe, French doctrine is not dogmatic but 
rather pragmatic. Academic writing may look formalistic at first sight, when one 
considers form and style. However, French ( tort law ) scholars tend on the whole 
to be quite informed, and they discuss economic and sociological implications of 
solutions, particularly in the case notes. A finger is sometimes pointed at the lack 
of interest the French have for &raquo; law and &hellip; &laquo; scholarship, particularly regarding law 
and economics and feminist studies. This may be because the French have done 
these things for a long time, and do not need to stick a label onto it. One should 
not confuse formalism and dogmatism. The French are formalist realists. They 
like their system to be open and to evolve according to ever changing social needs.
</p>
<p>In its practice, French law is averse to all-or-nothing approaches and tends 
to make pragmatic use of its very few open-ended general Civil Code provisions. 
Apportioning based on comparative negligence is common practice in the courts, 
though this term is not used, especially where liability is based on the fact of a 
thing. When considering the victim&rsquo;s negligence in view of apportioning the strict 
liability of the party having custody of the thing causing the damage17, judges can-
not but also have in mind the negligence of the defendant, proving that in French 
court practice there is a de-facto grey zone between fault-based and so-called strict 
liability for the fact of a thing. Purists and dogmatists may be right in saying that 
in law the apportionment of liability should be an issue of causation and not of 
fault. However, looking at court practice, especially at a time when courts applied 
art 1384 to road accidents18, in a case for example where the driver went through 
a red light at high speed and hit a distracted pedestrian crossing outside the pro-
tected area, the trial judge was likely to be more fault conscious than causation 
minded when reducing the compensation owed to the victim.
</p>
<p>Likewise, the compensation for loss of a chance is a way of introducing pro-
portional liability into French law19. When the actor&rsquo;s fault prevents the victim

<p>cause it is not proven that the actor&rsquo;s fault has caused the loss &laquo;, the victim can 
claim that the fault has caused the loss of a chance. The loss of a chance is seen as 
a head of damage20, and compensation will be anywhere between 1 % and 99 % of 
what other systems would view as the full damage, wherever the claimant is pres-
ently and certainly deprived of a favourable opportunity21.
</p>
<p>Another test of the elasticity of rules is the high propensity of the French Court 
of Cassation, the highest Court in charge of preserving the Civil Code&rsquo;s integrity 
and securing the national unity of its interpretation, to declare that the extent of 
damage, the existence of negligence, the amount of negligence by the victim and 
its causal role, etc, are questions of fact left up to the free assessment or discretion 
of the lower courts. What appears to be a question of law in other jurisdictions 
may be described as a question of fact, restricting the ambit of the Court of Cassa-
tion&rsquo;s power of review. Self-restraint and deference help control the floodgates, in 
a system where all litigants are allowed to challenge the legality of any final judg-
ment in the Court of Cassation. The highest Court shows great mastery at self-
defining the ambit of its review power. At times it restricts its control ( and limits 
the flow of cases, a matter of survival ) by stretching the notion of fact and there-
fore limiting the questions of law to be subjected to its review. When it identifies 
shortcomings of self-restraint, it easily stretches its review powers by reminding 
lower courts that, after all, it has jurisdiction to examine what it calls d&eacute;naturation, 
which means wrongful legal characterisation of the facts. These processes of dis-
guised discretion have fascinated comparatists like Mario Rotondi22. This is totally 
undogmatic, it allows for greater flexibility and fluidity, without a need to change 
the law. The French are masterful at steering their apparently rigid system in sub-
tle and not visible ways. Judges and scholars have no interest in disclosing overly 
effective powers; this allows them to operate backstage, without being caught in 
the eye of politics. This is the heritage of having developed in a rigid system: loop-
holes have to be identified and the limits of rigidity are constantly tested to allow 
for greater flexibility. Be subtle, do not get caught, especially if you are trying to 
give an effective response to a basic question of tort law !
</p>
<p>20 This is easily done as the Civil Code does not define heads of damage.

<p>Part 2  The law of damages within the system for the 
protection of rights and legal interests
</p>
<p>I. In general
</p>
<p>There is no phrase in France that is equivalent to &raquo; Schadenersatzrecht &laquo; or law of 
damages. It is quite uncommon in French scholarship to look at things in the way 
they are combined in this chapter. This is not to say that French law has nothing to 
say on compensation of damage. For instance, a well-known book addresses &raquo; Droit 
du dommage corporel, Syst&egrave;mes d&rsquo;indemnisation &laquo;23, and not surprisingly crosses 
the line separating tort law from insurance law and other disciplines, but with a 
focus on bodily injury. Recent developments show that the French are also explor-
ing the possibility of expanding compensation towards disgorgement of illicit ben-
efits in proposing that exemplary damages may be legitimate. However, inroads in 
the direction of disgorgement24 or punishment25 should not be too distractive. The 
function of damages under French law remains primarily compensatory.
</p>
<p>The following paragraphs will consider damages in relation to other remedies 
available in the case of undue interference with rights and legal interests, trying to 
follow the reverse engineering process Koziol invites us to engage in, which seems 
to take us from the situation where compensation ( lato sensu, as he also covers 
claims in restitution ) seems due without many prerequisites to cases where com-
pensation may be available but subject to more stringent conditions.
</p>
<p>II. Claims for recovery
</p>
<p>As in other systems, restitution or &raquo; recovery &laquo;, as it is called by Koziol26, allows the 
claimant to recover things or monies that he is entitled to when the defendant is 
not allowed to hold on to such things or monies. Under French law, this covers

</p>
<p>restoration of a payment not owed ( r&eacute;p&eacute;tition de l&rsquo;indu )27 and enrichment without 
cause ( enrichissement sans cause ), traditionally ranged in the category of &raquo; quasi 
contracts &laquo; and therefore part of the law of obligations28. Most claims for recovery 
intersect with the law of property ( droit des biens ) in those cases where people are 
illegitimately deprived of things they own or of the fruit thereof ( revendication ). 
When such things have been damaged or destroyed, money compensation will be 
paid instead.
</p>
<p>III. Preventive injunctions
</p>
<p>According to art 808 of the Code of Civil Procedure: &raquo; In any case of urgency, the 
president of the Tribunal de grande instance may order by way of r&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; any mea-
sure that does not raise any serious objection or that may be justified by the exist-
ence of a dispute. &laquo;
</p>
<p>Article 809 also provides that: &raquo; The president may always, even in the case of 
a serious dispute, order by way of  r&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; any necessary protective or restorative 
measures, either to prevent an imminent damage or to stop an obviously unlawful 
disorder. In cases where the existence of the obligation may not be seriously dis-
puted, he may award an interim payment to the creditor or order the performance 
of the obligation even when it is an obligation to do. &laquo;
</p>
<p>These provisions are frequently used in the context of media law, to prevent 
defamation or any infringement of rights of privacy, or rights people have to their 
image29. These rights are protected by art 9 of the Civil Code, also making provi-
sion for preventive injunctions: &raquo; Everyone has a right to respect for his privacy. 
Judges may, without prejudice to reparation for damage suffered, prescribe any 
measures, such as sequestration, seizure and others, proper to prevent or termi-
nate an attack on the intimacy of private life; such measures may, in case of ur-
gency, be ordered by r&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; &laquo;.
</p>
<p>This does not mean that preventive injunctions are exclusively used for the 
prevention of primarily non-pecuniary damage. They may also be granted in the 
case of other torts. For instance, they are frequently used in cases of nuisance, a 
tort causing a mix of economic loss and non-pecuniary damage30. However, few 
tort scholars make reference to prevention and preventive injunctions when dis-

<p>cussing tort law, which is understandable as these procedural techniques are not 
part of tort law31.
</p>
<p>IV. Rights to self-defence
</p>
<p>French law does not use the term self-defence ( auto-d&eacute;fense ) but recognises legiti-
mate defence ( l&eacute;gitime d&eacute;fense )32. However, the term self-defence will be used for 
the sake of convenience. Self-defence is not much discussed in French tort law lit-
erature, as it typically comes up in criminal cases. Victims of crimes have the option 
of bringing their tort claim in the form of a civil action ( &raquo; action civile &laquo;, as distin-
guished from the &raquo; action publique &laquo; conducted by the prosecutor ) before the crimi-
nal court; self-defence is usually discussed in the context of criminal proceedings.
</p>
<p>Self-defence is defined in the Penal Code33. It is no longer a justification ( fait 
justificatif ) but a bar to liability ( cause d&rsquo;irresponsabilit&eacute; ), eliminating all crimi-
nal and civil liability, whether based on fault34 or on the fact of a thing35. Much as 
in Austrian law36, such defence must be proportionate37, which makes the defence 
legitimate ( l&eacute;gitime d&eacute;fense ).
</p>
<p>V. Reparative injunctions
</p>
<p>Such injunctions make sense when some wrongful interference with the plain-
tiff&rsquo;s rights has already occurred. They also have the effect of preventing such oc-
currence or repetition of the damage in the future.
</p>
<p>This is not to be confused with reparation in kind, which addresses the past. 
Cases where courts order reparation in naturam are a rare occurrence. Not that 
reparation in kind is uncommon in court practice: many a tortfeasor would offer 
first aid and relief to the victim, or volunteer to repair things that have been dam-
aged, sometimes avoiding the consequences of a law suit. However, victims typi-
cally sue for money compensation of what has not or cannot be repaired in kind.

<p>13Part 2&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;law&emsp;of&emsp;damages&emsp;within&emsp;the&emsp;system
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>There is authority to affirm that judges may choose either to award damages 
or to grant an injunction to do or not to do38. However, French procedural law does 
not offer any efficient means for the enforcement of such injunctions, thus inclin-
ing judges to use the award of damages as a deterrent, or in the form of &raquo; astreinte &laquo; 
( a per diem penalty to be paid per day of delay in giving the other party satisfac-
tion ), though the latter is more common in the context of non-performance of 
contractual obligations.
</p>
<p>Reparative injunctions are more likely to be requested as interim measures, 
following a regime that is pretty much the same as for preventive injunctions. They 
are governed by the Code of Civil Procedure39, which provides access to restorative 
remedies by means of summary proceedings ( r&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; ) even where a serious dispute 
exists. Cases deal with the removal of a source of wrongful interference, such as 
toxic waste40, or a scene in a film that interferes with protected personality rights41. 
Oftentimes, interim measures are not appealed and the plaintiff abandons the 
main claim, having obtained at least partial ( and sometimes full ) satisfaction.
</p>
<p>Though French law does not establish a hierarchy of protected interests in 
tort law, it appears that highly protected rights are more easily protected by way of 
injunction than rights of lesser importance. Ownership being a highly protected 
right42, anything seeping in or moving from the neighbour&rsquo;s land will allow the 
owner to request that the disturbance be put to an end, regardless of the cost, ei-
ther by &raquo; r&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; &laquo; or possessory action43. Possessory actions are open to a large pool 
of plaintiffs ( evidence of possession suffices, no need to prove title ), but French 
law considers from time immemorial that a present occupant will do a better job 
of protecting the property than a distant owner, and that at the end of the day, pro-
tection of the possessor benefits the owner. For this reason, possessory actions 
have been made accessible to lessees, though technically, under French law, the 
lessee is not a possessor, merely having the corpus ( physical occupation ) but no 
animus ( belief that you have full owner&rsquo;s rights )44.

</p>
<p>The same can be said of the protection of honour and privacy, justifying the 
removal of a scene from a recorded television programme or film45.
</p>
<p>In such cases, courts will not check that all conditions applicable to a tort ac-
tion in damages are met since they are directly protecting either property rights or 
rights of the personality: proof of the infringement of such a right suffices. They 
may do so, however, in the case of a resident ( whether owner or tenant ) complain-
ing of the inconvenience caused by the storage of toxic waste on neighbouring 
land: in such a case, it is not a property right that is protected; instead we have a 
typical case of nuisance ( trouble de voisinage ), and the requirements of such tort 
action must be satisfied46.
</p>
<p>VI. Unjust enrichment by interference
</p>
<p>A party drawing advantages from property that the law allocates to another must 
surrender such enrichment to the owner of such property. Supposing that I hap-
pen to receive a deposit of furniture belonging to a third party: unless otherwise 
agreed I am not allowed to lease them, and any monies I would make in so doing 
would accrue to the owner thereof. French law may of course recognise that res-
titution of such undue benefit be ordered under the doctrine of enrichment with-
out cause. This doctrine is not based on a Civil Code article but derived by anal-
ogy from the action in payment of a thing not owed47 and based on the Roman law 
of actio de in rem verso48. Though in principle it may be based on the enrichment 
without cause jurisprudence, the remedy is more based on the law of property. 
It is viewed as a natural consequence of the traditional definition of ownership, 
granting the owner the usus, fructus, and abusus; accordingly natural or civil fruits 
produced by a thing accrue to the owner. There are, however, situations where the 
bona fide possessor of things may keep those fruits despite having the obligation 
to restitute the thing to its legitimate owner49.
</p>
<p>Such claims are clearly distinguishable from claims in damages that may come 
in addition, for instance when the possessor acted in bad faith or dishonestly. This

<p>15Part 2&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;law&emsp;of&emsp;damages&emsp;within&emsp;the&emsp;system
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>comes close to claims for recovery described at the beginning of this chapter. The 
point is not to evaluate a damage caused by whatever fault but to make sure that 
what belongs to the claimant can be fully recovered by him, either in kind or in 
value, when the thing has been lost or destroyed. If at fault, the defendant may of 
course be liable in damages to the extent of harm caused by the fact of being un-
lawfully deprived of property, but this comes in addition to the claim in restitution.
</p>
<p>This is a place in property law where the moral element comes forth: only the 
party possessing a thing in bad faith must return the thing and the fruit that ac-
crued during possession. The bona fide purchaser is indeed allowed to keep such 
fruit. In tort language, this means that the legitimate owner is prima facie to face 
the loss of income caused by the deprivation of property he owns in all those cases 
where the party found in possession of it was not at fault. This is a fair rule. The 
only party that would owe compensation is the one that illegitimately, by fault, 
misappropriated the thing and disposed of it in an illegitimate manner. Wherever 
this intermediate party can be identified, a tort law suit may be initiated against 
him by the legitimate owner who has recovered possession.
</p>
<p>The Romanist legal tradition tends to follow a  doctrine of  allocation  ( Zuwei-
sungstheorie ), but the fact of depriving the owner of what belongs to him can at 
the same time be described as per se unlawful. There is no need, however, to prove 
fault since this is an action in restitution, which aims at disgorging an illegitimate 
profit and not an action in damages. In the case of dishonesty of the enriched per-
son, however, there may be room for the law of tort for the compensation of ad-
ditional damage. The existence of fraud or dishonesty may indeed change the col-
oration of such a case in the Romanist legal family as it does in the Germanic one, 
giving the case a fully tortious coloration. The payment may appear as compensa-
tion rather than disgorgement, but in essence, it remains disgorgement.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the destruction of equipment belonging to my competitor 
so that I may gain a competitive advantage at first sight looks purely tortious in 
nature, though I may misappropriate an economic advantage as a consequence 
of such wrongful action, much like the burglar breaking in to steal jewellery and 
computer equipment. Compensation for the destruction of the equipment and for 
the breakage of the door will be made in the form of damages. It has nothing to 
do with restitution, which may, however, apply to the stolen things in the second 
example. But may the victim recoup the wrongful benefit ?
</p>
<p>Describing the remedy as disgorgement rather than damages places the vic-
tim in a much stronger position and enhances deterrence, for instance where a 
thief resells drugs stolen from a pharmacy at well above the market value or regu-
lated price. The enrichment remedy allows for more efficient disgorgement of the 
illicit benefit50, whereas damages do not go beyond the mere compensation of the 
</p>
<p>50 Though criminal law may interfere to confiscate unlawful gains.

</p>
<p>harm suffered, meaning a limitation to the market value or compensation up to 
the value of the thing destroyed.
</p>
<p>Can we say that the competitor who destroys the victim&rsquo;s machinery in order 
to artificially create a monopoly situation, or who destroys the reputation of his 
rival for the same purpose, must compensate not on the basis of tort law but in-
stead restitute undue benefit on an unjust enrichment basis ? Unjust enrichment 
would favour disgorgement of the illicit benefit. Koziol indeed makes this conten-
tion51, which appears counterintuitive at first sight, but is a fair and logical one. 
We may have a clear case of damage to property allowing for compensation for 
the destruction of the machine ( first situation ) or defamation allowing for limited 
compensation ( second situation ). In both cases, damages do not have the effect 
of disgorging the illicit benefit, and compensation of the economic loss will be 
limited, largely due to causation issues. Unjust enrichment favours full disgorge-
ment, and thus proves a much more powerful remedy in such circumstances, also 
in terms of deterrence.
</p>
<p>Koziol cites examples in intellectual property where, under Austrian law, re-
muneration obtained through patent infringement accrues to the owner of the 
patent, in a situation where German law only allows for compensatory damages52. 
French law also opens up the possibility of disgorgement in such a case: the Code 
of Intellectual Property invites the judge to take the adverse economic conse-
quences into account, including lost benefits and benefits obtained by the defen- 
dant, when assessing damages in cases of patent infringement ( contrefa&ccedil;on )53. 
The language of the Code is not free from ambiguity: it uses the word damages 
( dommages et inter&ecirc;ts ) but the core of the text is unjustified enrichment terminol-
ogy54. French law views this as tort when in fact it is unjustified enrichment.

<p>VII.  Creditors&rsquo; &raquo; avoidance &laquo; ( action paulienne )
</p>
<p>Like other Romanist systems, French law has inherited the actio pauliana ( action 
paulienne ) allowing creditors to annul transactions by means of which an insol-
vent debtor defrauds his creditors55. This is not an action in damages but it pre-
vents the damage that creditors would suffer due to fewer assets being available in 
distribution proceedings. In that sense it is both preventive and reparative, but it 
is connected in French law to the doctrine of patrimony, as defined by Aubry and 
Rau56. The aim is to protect the patrimonial rights of the creditors, especially in 
the absence of securities, since creditors then have a general pledge on all the as-
sets of the debtor57. Koziol rightly connects this action with the principle of unjus-
tified enrichment. Money will eventually go where it is supposed to. This may be 
identified as a moral foundation of French rules which, as connected to the doc-
trine of patrimony as they may be, aim at avoiding or mitigating the consequences 
of fraudulent actions.
</p>
<p>VIII.  Claims for damages
</p>
<p>Expected to appear first in a classic tort presentation, claims for damages come far 
afield in Koziol&rsquo;s analysis. His presentation of damages as compensatory and serv-
ing in addition a function of deterrence matches Romanist conventional analysis, 
though the idea that the outcome of a damages award shifts the onus of the dam-
age to someone else is less conventional58. French tort law remains, in this respect, 
rooted in the Aristotelian idea of corrective justice.
</p>
<p>IX. &raquo; Punitive damages &laquo; ?
</p>
<p>French law, like other Continental systems, does not recognise claims for puni-
tive damages. Common law systems accept them on the premise that compen- 
satory damages are not a sufficient lever to allow tort law to perform its deter-
rence function. Koziol discusses the need for higher damages in the area of intel-

<p>lectual property, where compensation and disgorgement do not suffice to prevent 
misuse of such rights. Rather than researching whether such punitive elements 
exist in French law, it suffices to say that the question once again invites a holistic 
approach.
</p>
<p>Looking at the United States&rsquo; reluctance to develop a welfare state and engage 
in heavy and costly regulatory mechanisms, punitive damages make sense. They 
aim at policing various industries and create incentives to adopt safety measures 
that such industries would not adopt spontaneously, especially when they calcu-
late that it is less costly to compensate a few victims of defective products than 
to take more expensive preventive measures. The fear of unpredictable punitive 
damages does create incentives in this respect.
</p>
<p>In highly regulated European countries, punitive damages need not be pro-
moted so openly, but a punitive element may be tracked here and there. In French 
law, they are used as a substitute for the lack of efficient injunction enforcement 
mechanisms. Compensation of non-pecuniary damage, though compensatory in 
nature, is not entirely devoid of a punitive element. In addition, though the ex-
ample comes from the law of contract, it is commonplace for French courts to 
order the enforcement of an obligation to do under &raquo; astreinte &laquo;, which means that 
a party ( typically a contractor ) will have to pay a per diem penalty for every day a 
construction project is delayed.
</p>
<p>Punitive damages supplement or remedy the flaws of other legal mechanisms 
aiming at the prevention of damage, such as criminal law, safety regulations, or 
sometimes enforcement mechanisms. Renaming them &raquo; preventive damages &laquo; as 
suggested by Gerhard Wagner59 may help identify the deterrence and preventive 
function but this does not remove the punitive element making them a private 
fine. On the other hand, if the purpose is disgorgement of profit, unjustified en-
richment devices are a better fit and the word restitution should be used instead.
</p>
<p>X. Insurance contract law
</p>
<p>Considered in general, insurance appears to be a planned distribution of risk60. 
The French collectively agree that the development of universal social security or 
insurance coverage, compulsory insurance, combined with the multiplication of 
compensation funds, is the best way to make sure people do not have to face harsh 
consequences when hit by adverse harmful events, whether caused by wrong-
ful activity or not. One may say that the collectivisation of risks is a strong and

</p>
<p>constant political choice, which became part of the social contract in the years 
that followed the end of World War II. Solidarity, a word then given constitutional 
value61, prevails over individualism. On the whole, the French may be willing to 
sacrifice the individual possibility of full compensation rather than abandoning 
the idea that risks may be hedged, even if this is at the cost of lower compensation, 
especially as they know that their courts have never been very generous in the 
assessment of damages.
</p>
<p>Whilst it cannot be denied that third-party liability insurance &raquo; considerably 
impedes the deterrence function of the law of tort, possibly even eliminates it &laquo;62, 
the French agree that the deterrence function can be disconnected from compen-
sation mechanisms. When promoting a strict liability scheme for the compen-
sation of the victims of road traffic accidents, Andr&eacute; Tunc  insisted that the task 
of tort law is compensation rather than deterrence63. Deterrence was to be aban-
doned to criminal law or to other mechanisms of insurance law. The French expe-
rience proves that strict enforcement of the Highway Code with the help of crimi-
nal law and incentives in the calculation of insurance premiums offer an adequate 
substitute.
</p>
<p>Accepting that other parts of the law contribute to deterrence is no denial of 
deterrence as one of the functions of tort law, but this deterrence function tends 
to be marginal and to prosper on the forefront of new torts, before being caught 
by the expansion of insurance and socialisation of risk.
</p>
<p>XI. Social security law
</p>
<p>The purpose of the social security system &raquo; is to secure livelihoods &laquo;64 covering cost 
of treatment and loss of earning, at least to some extent. Koziol points out its in-
tersection with tort law, but as said above, the solidarity element is a fundamental 
component of the French experience65.
</p>
<p>When a patient is to receive medical treatment as a consequence of injury that 
appears to be caused by accident, a social security form must be filled in, request-
ing the patient or his representative to indicate whether this accident was caused 
by a third party and, where this is the case, all relevant information must be pro-

<p>vided. When the injuries were caused in a road traffic accident, the social security 
provider has recourse against the third party liable or his insurer, to recover hos-
pital fees, medical treatment costs and sickness benefits that have been disbursed 
for the victim66. More generally, a full chapter of the Social Security Code deals 
with recourse against third parties, limiting legal subrogation to the recovery of 
what has been disbursed to the benefit of the victim, leaving the latter with the 
right to claim compensation for whatever exceeds social security payments67.
</p>
<p>XII.  Compensating victims of crime and catastrophes
</p>
<p>Victims of crime have a limited chance to recover from the perpetrator. However, 
French procedural law allows the victim to conduct a &raquo; civil action &laquo; before crimi-
nal courts ( plainte avec constitution de partie civile ), which significantly reduces 
litigation costs: the victim can use the evidence gathered by the prosecution and 
judicially led investigation. Where recovery is impossible, either because the per-
petrator has not been identified or because he happens to be impecunious, a com-
pensation fund will provide compensation. The Compensation Fund that had 
been created to cover damage suffered by victims of uninsured motorists now cov-
ers victims of crime when they cannot be compensated otherwise68.
</p>
<p>Regarding victims of catastrophes, the French do not share the Germanic con-
cern that helping collective disaster victims would create a situation of inequality. 
Immediately after World War II, the Preamble to the French Constitution made 
national solidarity in the case of national disaster a priority69. From a French per-
spective, it would be wrong to claim that victims of disasters are better compen-
sated than individual victims. French law in this regard wants to ensure that the 
risk of disaster damage remains insurable and to afford victims the benefit of na-
tional solidarity, just as when they are victims of individual accidents. It imposes 
compulsory coverage of damage to property as a consequence of natural disasters 
upon all purchasers of car or homeowner insurance, subject to a declaration of na-
tional disaster by the public authorities. The system redistributes half of the cost 
by way of reinsurance and the State is the ultimate guarantor in case the national 
system of reinsurance fails. A similar system is in place to compensate damage

<p>caused by technological disasters70. These schemes operate the same way for all 
victims, whether or not delictual action or omission caused the disaster or made 
it more harmful. Wherever tort action is available, victims may obtain additional 
compensation, but they are treated equally as far as compulsory insurance cover-
age and social security are concerned.
</p>
<p>It is wrong to say that helping victims of disasters creates incentives to move 
to more risk-prone areas, for at least two reasons. Firstly, much economic activ-
ity can only develop and flourish in risk-prone areas such as floodable plains or 
seaports, large cities, etc. Secondly, incentives can be created to encourage people 
not to stay in hazardous places or press public authorities to adopt plans that may 
mitigate the risks.
</p>
<p>In all regards, the French system of prevention and compensation of victims 
of catastrophes remains to this day a most efficient model71. It redistributes and 
therefore minimises the risks with all necessary incentives, and is primarily based 
on private insurance. State regulation simply aims at keeping high risks insurable 
and monitoring reinsurance with the guarantee of the State as ultimate recourse. 
Law and economics scholars came to accept that national solidarity could justify 
an exception to purely market based mechanisms, as long as the policy aims at 
keeping high risks insurable72. This does not mean that this system would resist 
catastrophes of much larger magnitude: it is too early to predict the consequences 
of climate change, but the multiplication of super storms and major floods along 
with rising sea levels here and shortage of water there call up bleak scenarios. No 
State has yet invented a sustainable model in this regard, and compensation is 
likely to decrease as disasters intensify73.
</p>
<p>XIII.  Disgorgement claims
</p>
<p>There are situations where illicit profit is to be disgorged and yet, it is unreason-
able to do this to the benefit of impoverished parties, as in traditional cases of 
unjustified enrichment. This may be the case where the principal victim of illicit

<p>activity is the environment, or millions of consumers, each for a small amount, 
such as in the example of anticompetitive practices. That such disgorgement must 
benefit charities or non-profit organisations or the State is a matter of general 
agreement. French law favours civil actions by non-profit organisations before 
criminal courts, provided they prove that the wrongful action has harmed the in-
terest they support74. This is the case under competition law, which more often 
than not is European Union driven.
</p>
<p>XIV. Criminal law
</p>
<p>The only reason why criminal law must be mentioned here is that it serves the 
purpose of deterrence, whether regarded as special ( preventing the repetition of 
criminal acts by the same perpetrator ) or general ( increasing compliance by the 
public ). Yet, as seen, tort law and criminal law do intersect, at least in the court 
room ( plainte avec constitution de partie civile ).
</p>
<p>XV. Concluding remarks
</p>
<p>To a French scholar trained in the art of dividing papers into two sections and 
then two subsections ( see the French formal garden ), this exercise looks like a 
random inventory, &raquo; un inventaire &agrave; la Pr&eacute;vert &laquo;. Nevertheless, a French tort law 
scholar would not be shocked to see so many different rules and mechanisms in-
tersect and interact. Even the importance of a public law element does not seem 
surprising, whether the public law category is defined by Germanic standards ( in-
cluding criminal law and social security ) or French standards ( leaving criminal 
law and social security law within the realm of private law ). French law is used to 
having administrative law develop an autonomous body of rules to regulate torts 
caused by the operation of public entities, under the stewardship of the Conseil 
d&rsquo;&Eacute;tat.
</p>
<p>The conclusion that &raquo; more regard should be had to how prerequisites are 
matched to legal consequences, above all to the fact that more onerous legal con-
sequences call for stricter prerequisites &laquo;75 may make sense in a world where most 
human and social interaction would be governed by traditional &raquo; Civil Code &laquo; mech-

<p>anisms. However, in a complex society combining and recombining elements of 
private and public law, and promoting social solidarity as a key element of the 
public good, pragmatic approaches tend to prevail over dogmatic views.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless at the end of the day, it seems that under French law, strict liabil-
ity is often coupled with insurance, making the tortfeasor easily liable but miti-
gating the consequences by compulsory insurance coverage, whereas fault-based 
liability keeps developing in areas of higher risks that may not be insured or insur-
able. It may then be said that the prerequisites fit the legal consequences, though 
more investigation may be needed to check whether this is always the case. Last 
but not least, the author of these lines will not object to the necessity for clearly 
distinguishing claims in damages ( whether based on tort or on contract ) and 
claims in restitution, whether they aim at disgorging illicit profit or remedying an 
unjustified enrichment. The tasks of tort law must indeed be clarified.

<p>Part 3 The tasks of tort law
</p>
<p>I. Compensatory function
</p>
<p>All European civil law systems will agree that the law of tort is meant &raquo; to provide 
the victim with compensation for damage that has already been sustained &laquo;76. No sen-
sible French jurist will contest this. Even in a case where tort law serves a preven-
tive function, such as the landowner seeking compensation for the construction of 
a wall to avoid the high risk of a landslide created by the uphill neighbour having 
carried out unreasonable excavations, the court actually awards damages to repair 
damage already sustained: the reasonable expenditure is incurred for no other 
reason than the need to avoid imminent and serious danger77. Damage that ap-
pears hypothetical only should not be compensated, though French lower courts 
occasionally order the taking of preventive measures in such circumstances, mak-
ing unwarranted reference to the precautionary principle78. Everyone agrees that 
&raquo; [ T ]he compensatory notion clearly expresses the purpose of tort law &laquo;79. This is 
ubiquitous in French tort law literature.
</p>
<p>Under French law, compensation is due for any kind of damage, the Civil Code 
making no distinction regarding heads of damage, which therefore include pure 
economic loss and non-pecuniary damage ( dommage moral ). Compensation of 
the latter, however, is not easily accepted in French doctrine. In a country of Cath-
olic culture, the idea of making money out of one&rsquo;s tears ( battre monnaie avec 
ses larmes )80 is disturbing. Compensation of non-pecuniary damage is still criti-

<p>cised in contemporary doctrine81. Earlier on, Georges Ripert claimed that this was 
not compensation, but a form of private punishment of the perpetrator82. Despite 
continued doctrinal challenges83, a jurisprudente constante has developed in the 
Court of Cassation, since a leading case decided in 183384. The Court recently de-
cided that a patient who had not been informed of the risk of impotence as a pos-
sible consequence of surgery ( prostate adenomectomy ) was eligible for compen-
sation of non-pecuniary harm85. Though it is not permissible for courts to make 
open reference to unofficial tables, databases have been created, based on a study 
of court of appeal decisions, to help assess the cost of the loss of a mother, a child, 
or a sibling 86. The award of a lump sum is sometimes compared to a penalty87.
</p>
<p>In a recent case, the Commercial Chamber of the Court of Cassation opened 
the right to recover non-pecuniary damages to juridical persons88. The matter had 
long been debated and the solution receives strong doctrinal approval89. Allegedly, 
it is possible to harm a juridical person in its essence rather than its assets ( dans 
son &ecirc;tre et non dans son avoir )90. One of the doctrinal draft reforms of the law of 
obligations follows this erroneous trend91. Planiol and Ripert offer strong authority 
to the contrary: they wisely state that a juridical person cannot suffer and there-
fore cannot be a victim of non-pecuniary damage92. When courts offer such com-
pensation, either they want to compensate pecuniary damage ( an economic loss,

<p>actually ) that they are unable to assess, or they want to impose a non-criminal 
penalty, camouflaged under the name of compensation of non-pecuniary dam-
age93.
</p>
<p>Though literature examined does not relate non-pecuniary damages to the se-
riousness of fault, the penalty theory seems to imply such a connection. This does 
not contradict the jurisprudential rule that the assessment of damages is to be 
made without regard to the seriousness of fault94 if one admits that the non-pecu-
niary damage is greater in cases where the tortfeasor acted intentionally.
</p>
<p>II. Deterrence and continuation of a right
</p>
<p>The deterrent function of civil liability is recognised in French tort law literature95. 
As Koziol puts it, &raquo; the threat of a duty to compensate in the event of damage be-
ing caused undoubtedly provides a general incentive to avoid inflicting damage &laquo;96. 
French authors agree that the deterrence function is secondary to compensa-
tion97, and they do not follow the tenets of law and economics on the issue: pen-
alty rather than compensation is more apt at performing an efficient deterrence 
function. Muriel Fabre-Magnan&rsquo;s pages discussing and challenging the law and eco-
nomics approach, and her conclusion that figures cannot explain everything, that 
reality cannot be reduced to mathematical formulae is a good reflection of French 
scepticism98: the law and economics creed that human activity is driven by maxi-
misation of wealth is over-simplistic and cannot explain everything. It is either ig-
nored or rejected by most scholars99.
</p>
<p>The fact that the widespread availability of third-party liability insurance re-
duces the deterrence function cannot be denied, but as Koziol observes, such in-
convenience is easily mitigated by the appropriate use of a bonus-malus system100, 
mandatory in France in the context of automobile insurance101.
</p>
<p>The notion of &raquo; continuation of a right &laquo; ( Rechtsfortsetzungsgedanke ) sees the 
injured right as surviving in a claim for compensation, meaning that the victim of

<p>property damage is to be compensated, at the minimum, for the objective market 
value, even if the victim subjectively is making no use of the property at the mo-
ment when the damage occurs102. The fact that this contributes to the function of 
deterrence103 seems undisputable.
</p>
<p>III. Penalty
</p>
<p>Traditionally important in Roman law and ancient law, and somehow surviving in 
the context of fault-based liability, the punitive function has lost ground in mod-
ern days, with the development of strict liability and the collectivisation of risks. 
Remnants are to be seen where international instruments cap the amount of com-
pensation payable to the victim or shield a party from all liability unless there has 
been intentional fault or gross negligence104. One still sees it at play in the case of 
non-performance of contractual obligations, the defaulting party in bad faith be-
ing obliged to compensate not only the foreseeable damage but also the unfore-
seeable, which does not mean, however, that the amount of damages will be dis-
connected from proven harm105.

<p>Part 4 The place of torts in the law of obligations
</p>
<p>The question of whether liability for failure to perform a contractual obligation 
( this term is preferred to &raquo; breach of contract &laquo; which has a strong common law 
overtone, presupposing the extinction of the contract by the mere fact of non-
performance ) is to be regarded as contractual liability and treated separately 
from tort or &raquo; civil &laquo; liability divides French doctrine106. The French Civil Code 
treats them separately107. The Catala draft proposal to reform the law of obliga-
tions would unify both regimes and treat them just like one108. On the other hand, 
the Terr&eacute; draft to reform contractual and delictual obligations retains the existing 
architecture of the Civil Code and treats both regimes separately109. Whilst both 
regimes converge regarding compensation of losses ( damnum emergens ), con-
tractual liability also entails compensation of lost profits ( lucrum cessans ), which 
makes it very different from delictual liability. Though logically separate, there 
are many places where both regimes intersect, offering a fascinating field for com-
parative studies110.

<p>In a previous paper, I approached the topic in a metaphoric manner, comparing 
tort, contract and restitution to celestial bodies. I wrote111:

law has developed a concept of chain of contract allowing direct action by a

<p>party at the end of the chain as against the one at the beginning. For instance, 
where sold goods are defective, the final purchaser may sue the manufacturer 
even where he received the goods from a retailer who purchased them from a 
distributor who got them from the manufacturer. In addition, many contracts 
are said to contain an implied contractual obligation de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, whereby car-
riers, medical doctors or suppliers of goods must compensate victims of per-
sonal injury and collateral losses.
</p>
<p>I further expounded on the analysis of contractual obligations under French law112:
</p>
<p> ▷ French law distinguishes two types of contractual obligations. The obligation 
de r&eacute;sultat is a typical contractual obligation where the party must perform 
and achieve the promised result. The duty for the seller to deliver the goods 
falls within this category, as well as the duty to transport the goods from the 
point of departure to the point of arrival in a contract of carriage of goods. 
The party in breach of such a duty is liable and there is no need to prove neg-
ligence. However, in some cases, a party is not bound to reach a promised 
outcome but to act with due care, in which case the obligation is called obli-
gation de moyens. The carrier of passengers can be made liable for the breach 
of such an obligation where a passenger slips on a snowy platform when 
boarding the train. In such cases, it is necessary to prove negligence; for in-
stance, the defective maintenance of the railway platform113.
</p>
<p> ▷ Liability for medical malpractice offers a good example. Such liability is 
based on contract in French law. As a rule, the practitioner is not bound by 
an &raquo; obligation de r&eacute;sultat &laquo; since in most cases there is no obligation to cure 
patients. In medical contracts, such an obligation may only exist where for 
instance a dentist promises to adjust and fix a cap on a tooth. Doctors are 
said to owe an &raquo; obligation de moyens &laquo;, whereby they must act with due care 
according to established scientific knowledge, as the courts repeatedly hold, 
following a landmark Cour de cassation case, the Mercier case, decided in 
1936114. As a rule, the victim must prove negligence. In some cases, however, 
the courts reverse the burden of proof and hold that negligence is presumed. 
Interestingly, in England, similar cases are decided not on the basis of con-
tract but under the tort of negligence. The patient will have no difficulty in 
</p>

113 Such an obligation, called an obligation of safety ( obligation de s&eacute;curit&eacute; ), is analysed by the 
</p>
<p>courts as an obligation of result when the damage occurs between the time the passenger 
boarded the train and the moment when he has stepped off. All these rules have been devised 
by the courts with minimal ( if any ) Code support. See O. Mor&eacute;teau, Codes as Straight-Jackets, 
Safeguards and Alibis, 20 North Carolina Journal of International Law 273, 285 ( 1995 ).

<p>proving the existence of a duty of care, given the special relationship stem-
ming from the contract between the patient and the practitioner. However, 
it may be quite difficult to establish that the doctor breached such duty and 
acted negligently115.
</p>
<p>The Court of Cassation has in the meantime changed the characterisation of the 
medical obligation from a contractual obligation of means into a legal one stem-
ming from the Code of Public Health116, making its violation a tort117. This does not 
change the regime of the obligation, even regarding prescription, as the reform of 
prescription adopted in 2008 unified the regimes of tort and contractual obliga-
tions in this regard118.
</p>
<p>Koziol  cites German and Swiss doctrine identifying a &raquo; third lane &laquo; between 
tort and contract119. Canaris  ( Germany )120 and Loser  ( Switzerland )121 base this in-
between liability on principles of reliance ( Vertrauenshaftung ), as I also did in my 
doctoral work stemming from a study of the law of estoppel122. In my Grey Zone 
article, I proposed to map out the law of obligations not as a triangle featuring 
tort, contract and restitution, but a quadrangle adding the concept of reliance or 
estoppel as a fourth corner, and identifying connections between all four corners. 
Reliance or estoppel is more than a &raquo; third lane &laquo; or &raquo; core area &laquo;123 between tort and 
contract. It also intersects with restitution124:
</p>
<p>The four corners of the law of obligations may be described by the following 
words used here in a very loose sense, followed by an indication of their basic 
function:
</p>
<p> ▷ contracts: referring to an obligation to perform;
 ▷ torts: referring to an obligation to compensate;
 ▷ restitution: referring to an obligation to give back;
 ▷ estoppel: referring to an obligation not to deny.
</p>
<p>All four terms are meant to designate a basic function of the law of obligations, 
for the sake of comparison. Each corner may interfere with the other three ( hence

<p>formidable confusion in the literature and the terminology ), as will be observed, 
when considering them in turn.
</p>
<p>This framework, comparative in essence, may be helpful in describing cases 
decided in any intermediary grey zone or &raquo; interim area &laquo;, as Koziol puts it125.
</p>
<p>II. Cases in the grey zone or &raquo; interim area &laquo;
</p>
<p>Many of those cases that are not core cases of tort law or contract law, but seem 
to fall in between, tend to be addressed as contract cases under French jurispru-
dence, though this is not always the case. French courts have a long history of 
stretching the scope of contractual obligations, so that they may benefit third par-
ties. For instance, warranties owed by the seller to the buyer have been extended 
to sub-purchasers under the doctrine of chain or group of contracts, and benefits 
may be stretched to non-party users such as members of the household or family, 
such being justified under an implied stipulation to the benefit of a third party. 
The doctrine of chain or group of contracts has been largely abandoned, the Court 
of Cassation now insisting on the relative effect of contract stated in art 1165 of 
the Civil Code126, and no longer allowing third-party victims of contractual non-
performance to sue for contractual liability, at least in most circumstances. Third-
party victims of damage caused by a defective product in any case no longer need 
to ride on contractual warranties, now that they benefit from a sui generis regime 
under the European Directive of 1985.
</p>
<p>Moreover, French courts are prompt to infer non-negotiated implied obliga-
tions to ensure the safety of the other party ( obligation de s&eacute;curit&eacute; ), in contracts of 
transportation, medical contracts, contracts with amusement parks, restaurants 
and more generally facilities open to the public127. The doctrinal distinction be-
tween obligations of result ( obligation de r&eacute;sultat ) and obligations of means ( obli-
gations de moyens ) allows for case-by-case fine tuning. An obligation of result will 
be identified where courts favour traditional no-fault based contractual liability 
( strict liability if based on tort law ), and the obligation will be characterised as &raquo; of 
means &laquo; where it is clear that the party owes no result but best efforts, in which case 
proof of negligence must be adduced. In such cases, the requirements are equiva-
lent to fault-based tort liability. As mentioned above, liability for medical malprac-
tice tends to retreat from the realm of contract to be treated as tort liability.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>The general requirement that contracts are to be performed in good faith128 is 
understood as creating a duty to cooperate129. It allows courts to identify contrac-
tual duties not to act against the interest of the other party130. The obligation of 
loyalty imposed on employees is an example: it is inferred from art 1135 of the Civil 
Code, stating that: &raquo; Agreements oblige not only as to what is therein expressed, 
but also as to all consequences which equity, usage or the law give to the obliga-
tion according to its nature. &laquo;
</p>
<p>One may note the strong connection between cooperation, loyalty, good faith 
and reliance. Whenever it can be connected to an existing contract, contractual li-
ability is likely to prevail.
</p>
<p>The counter-example of a case in the grey or interim zone that may be treated 
as tort, and not as contract, is pre-contractual liability. The first situation is where 
the court is convinced that in the course of the negotiations, parties entered into 
a pre-agreement ( avant-contrat ), in which case breach of the negotiation may be 
treated as non-performance of the avant-contrat, triggering contractual liability. 
The second situation is where, according to court findings, the parties have devel-
oped a strong relation of confidence and are getting very close to entering into a 
contractual relationship, though no pre-agreement may be identified at this stage. 
Because of clear representations by one party of the intention to contract, the 
other party relies on such representations and incurs transaction costs that may 
not have been reasonable in the absence of such representations and the situation 
generating reliance. In this case, breaking off the negotiation may trigger tort li-
ability. Culpa in contrahendo or pre-contractual liability under French law is there-
fore either contractual, or delictual. One may, however, observe a strong tendency 
of French courts to identify the existence of an &raquo; avant-contrat &laquo;, as they do not 
like to have liability rest on a unilateral manifestation of intent. In the author&rsquo;s 
opinion, French doctrine errs when systematically looking for a manifestation of 
will as a justification of liability in culpa in contrahendo cases, as such liability is  
delictual rather than contractual in the absence of a clear agreement or unilateral 
juridical act. The few scholars insisting that liability is reliance-based ( Vertrauens-
prinzip ) rather than intention-based remain a minority to this day131.

<p>III. The problem of concurrent claims
</p>
<p>Do plaintiffs benefit from an option where liability can be either contractual or 
delictual ? When asking this question, Koziol no longer discusses &raquo; interim &laquo; cases, 
but &raquo; core &laquo; cases132. The question is debated in French doctrine. The traditional 
distinction between tort and contract liability, reflected in the architecture of the 
Civil Code, has been challenged in recent years. Some claim that contractual li-
ability never existed133. Without going that far, the authors of the Catala draft re-
form of the law of obligations propose to gather all rules relating to contractual 
and extra-contractual liability in the same section of the Civil Code, which does 
not mean that they will be the same134. Many authors resist a merged approach, in-
cluding the authors of the Terr&eacute; draft reforms of contract and tort, who keep con-
tract and tort liability in separate sections of the Code135.
</p>
<p>Courts have not abandoned the traditional approach and keep deciding that 
a plaintiff has no freedom to opt between contractual and delictual liability. Each 
has a separate regime and it is necessary to identify which cause of action is to 
prevail136. The judge is to decide, in each case, which is the proper route. The sys-
tem is known under the name of  r&egrave;gle du non-cumul, but it actually means that 
firstly, one may not opt for one or the other regime, and secondly that one may not 
combine rules of contract liability with tort liability, or of course claim contract 
damages in addition to tort damages137. The reform of the law of prescription in 
2008 aligned both regimes, limiting the strategic interest parties may have had in 
playing one regime against the other138. The French system has not fully accepted 
the idea of a &raquo; uniform basis for the claim &laquo;139. The Catala draft, though endorsing a 
unitary presentation of tort and contract liability, does not abandon the &raquo; r&egrave;gle du 
non-cumul &laquo;, so that contractual clauses may not be by-passed, whether intended 
to liquidate the amount of damages to be paid or to limit or exclude liability140. 
However, the Catala draft would allow the victim of physical harm to choose the 
most favourable regime141.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Koziol discusses the problem of concurrent claims focusing on the require-
ments that need to be satisfied in order to make the other party liable. He does not 
insist on the quantum of compensation, or to be more precise, whether the plain-
tiff will receive compensation for his losses only ( damnum emergens, reliance 
damages, protection of the negative interest ), or may claim and receive, instead 
or in addition, compensation of the profit expected from the contract, such as the 
benefit anticipated from the resale of goods that have been ordered but not deliv-
ered ( lucrum cessans, expectation damages, protection of the positive interest ). 
The matter is of importance, since compensation of the economic loss consisting 
in deprivation of expected profit is only available in the case of non-performance of 
a typical contractual obligation142. The only place where Koziol discusses the extent 
of compensation relates to non-pecuniary losses143. Under French law, non-pecu-
niary losses can be recovered not only under tort liability but also on a contractual 
basis. One may be tempted to believe this is due to the fact that many actions for 
compensation of bodily injury are based on failure to perform a contractual obli-
gation of safety. However, this seems to be a much more general practice. As a rule 
and without much discussion in legal literature, though there is no express sup-
port in the Civil Code144, French law allows actions for compensation of non-pe-
cuniary damage in the case of non-performance of core contractual obligations145.
</p>
<p>Koziol tries to assess which of tort or contract liability is farther-reaching146. 
The answer is complex and variable depending on which aspect is looked at and 
what time period of the development of French law is considered. There was a time 
when victims of transportation accidents preferred a contractual action against a 
public carrier in order to benefit from a contractual obligation of safety, but if the 
court described it as an obligation of means rather than of result, proof of negli-
gence would be requested just as if the case had been based on fault-based tort li-
ability ( art 1382 ). However, the moment courts developed strict liability based on 
the custody of the thing ( art 1384 ), tort liability became more attractive. All the 
more when the law of 1985 on road traffic accidents made special provision in fa-
vour of victims, developing a system of absolute liability.

</p>
<p>More generally, it may be said that while expectation damages may be ob-
tained in a non-performance of contract case, the victim of a tort may escape a 
contract clause limiting the amount of damages. The French system of &raquo; non cu-
mul &laquo; ( which would be better termed the &raquo; non option &laquo; rule )147 prevents victims 
from remedy shopping. French law can no doubt be cited as an example of a sys-
tem where one must apply one regime to the exclusion of the other, though this 
does not necessarily mean that the requirements will be much different.

<p>Part 5 The basic criteria for a compensation claim
</p>
<p>From a French point of view, Koziol&rsquo;s presentation is in reverse order, moving from 
damage to causation ( chapter 5 ) and then to wrongfulness ( chapter 6 ). The French 
traditional view is to move from fault to causation and deal with damage last, but 
some contemporary authors would also start with damage and then move to cau-
sation, leaving the study of fault and strict liability to other chapters148. Starting 
with damage fully makes sense when considering tort law in its compensatory 
function, regardless of where we are149.
</p>
<p>I. Damage
</p>
<p>A. Definitions
</p>
<p>French law agrees that the existence of damage is a prerequisite for any right to 
compensation to arise. This of course excludes punitive damages, since they are 
not compensatory in nature150. It is also clear in French literature ( though this is 
not reflected in contemporary legislation )151 that the compensation of harm is to 
be separated from unjustified enrichment based restitution.
</p>
<p>The French Civil Code requires the existence of damage, without giving a defi-
nition thereof152. The definition given in the PETL under the heading &raquo; Recoverable 
Damage &laquo; is acceptable under French law: &raquo; Damage requires material or immate-
rial harm to a legally protected interest &laquo;153. However, French doctrine uses differ-
ent words.
</p>
<p>The French distinguish between dommage and pr&eacute;judice. &raquo; Dommage &laquo; is the 
translation of the Latin &raquo; damnum &laquo;, meaning a loss as opposed to a gain ( lucrum ). 
Damnum and  lucrum have no legal meaning154. Mazeaud explains that under the

<p>37Part 5&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;basic&emsp;criteria&emsp;for&emsp;a&emsp;compensation&emsp;claim
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>lex Aquilia, &raquo; damnum &laquo; describes harm to a thing, regardless of whether it caused 
a &raquo; pr&eacute;judice &laquo; to the owner155. &raquo; Pr&eacute;judice &laquo; is a legal term ( &raquo; praejudicium &laquo;, formed 
from the word &raquo; jus &laquo; ), describing the consequence of the harm ( often referred to 
as a &raquo; l&eacute;sion &laquo; ). Pr&eacute;judice  corresponds to recoverable damage. For instance, bodi- 
ly injury ( damnum ) may generate several pr&eacute;judices patrimoniaux such as loss of 
income, medical expenses, etc, and pr&eacute; judices extrapatrimoniaux ( pain and suffer-
ing, loss of amenity )156. In English we would say that bodily harm may generate pe-
cuniary and non-pecuniary damage, and in this context, damage means recover-
able damage. Just as harm is often confused with recoverable damage, the French 
tend to confuse &raquo; dommage &laquo; and &raquo; pr&eacute;judice &laquo;. The former is fact and the latter is 
legal in essence157. The distinction is important in the opinion of many authors158, 
for instance in private international law: harm may occur in a given jurisdiction 
( the country of the accident ) and recoverable damage may be suffered in another 
jurisdiction159. le Tourneau insists that harm or &raquo; dommage &laquo; may generate a profit 
for the victim. A first example is when I am under an obligation to pull down an 
old building I own, and a truck crashes into it, saving me the expense of destruc-
tion. A second example is where the victim of an accident must, because of bodily 
injury, abandon an earlier job and take a new one that turns out to be more profit-
able160. The idea that dommage and pr&eacute;judice must be distinguished is not a matter 
of general agreement. Viney points out that the two words are interchangeable in 
the Civil Code and in court decisions, as well as in a number of leading books161; 
she is not convinced that the distinction has significant practical consequences162.
</p>
<p>French jurists would agree that for damage to be recoverable &raquo; there must be 
impairment of interests recognised and therefore protected by the legal system &laquo;163. 
This perfectly translates the notion of &raquo; atteinte &agrave; un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t juri diquement pro-
t&eacute;g&eacute; &laquo;, which is ubiquitous in French tort literature164. Again, this does not appear

</p>
<p>in the Civil Code, which does not even use the word &raquo; pr&eacute;judice &laquo;. As in Austria,  
&raquo; [ T ] his criterion derives from fundamental principles of our legal systems &laquo;165 so 
that it may be described as a common core element. Like other legal systems, 
French law does not protect the interests of thieves or other fraudulent persons 
suffering loss to property illegally obtained: illicit damage is not recoverable166, 
the termination of illicit situations having been identified as one of the tasks of 
tort law167.
</p>
<p>As in other jurisdictions, tort law in France protects subjective rights, which 
makes it difficult to apprehend damage to general interests such as the environ-
ment168. The limits of private law are put to the test in this respect. The French al-
low compensation to be paid to public authorities and also to non-profit organi-
sations that fight for the preservation of the general interest at stake169. Whether 
these interests are to be allocated to the public sector170 is left to be seen. Further 
comparative studies are needed to promote more creative solutions, such as those 
found in the United States where the concept of public trust is used171, or countries 
like Bolivia or Ecuador that recognise that mother nature has rights that may be 
infringed and must be compensated172.

the defendants had to pay damages to &raquo; the local authorities to whom the law grants a spe-
cific competence in matter of environment, conferring upon them a special responsibility in 
the protection, management, and preservation of a territory &laquo;. Only those authorities having 
proved effective harm to a sensitive zone got compensation. Given its object, the LPO ( Ligue de 
protection des oiseaux ) was also eligible. The Parisian lower court noted the large scope of the 
disaster affecting the thousands of birds hibernating in the region, and also the very efficient 
role of the LPO in taking care of the birds during several months and in connecting with the 
local authorities and population, as well as its national and international representativeness. 
Such harm appears to be considered objectively rather than under consideration of the per-
son of the victim. It had been recognised before but never with such high scale compensation:

<p>B. Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage
</p>
<p>Based on the doctrine of patrimony, the French distinguish pr&eacute;judice patrimonial ( pe-
cuniary damage ) from pr&eacute;judice extrapatrimonial ( non-pecuniary damage ). Non-pe-
cuniary damage may find its source in bodily injury, but it may also be &raquo; moral&laquo; dam-
age ( dommage moral ) such as in cases of infringement of personality rights. It may 
also be linked to damage to property, such as the pain for the loss of a dear pet173.
</p>
<p>French law long resisted the idea that non-pecuniary damage could be com-
pensated174. Esmein blamed the commercialisation of pain175, while others pointed 
out the difficulty of establishing with reasonable certainty that such damage ex-
ists, not to mention the problem of assessment176. As mentioned above177, in a 
country of Catholic culture, the idea of making money out of one&rsquo;s tears ( battre 
monnaie avec ses larmes )178 is disturbing. Though the debate is not fully extin-
guished179, compensation of non-pecuniary damage is nowadays common prac-
tice180. A &raquo; jurisprudence constante &laquo; has developed in the Court of Cassation, since 
a leading case decided in 1833181, to the effect that as a matter of principle, non-
pecuniary damage must be compensated, just like any damage, regardless of its 
magnitude ( gravit&eacute; ) or particular nature ( consistance )182. As mentioned earlier183, 
though it is not permissible for courts to make open reference to unofficial tables, 
databases have been created, based on a study of court of appeal decisions, to help 
assess the cost of the loss of a mother, a child, or a sibling184. The award of a lump 
sum is sometimes compared to a penalty185.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>The question of whether a victim of bodily injury may be awarded non-pe-
cuniary damages when unconscious or in a vegetative state was a matter of de-
bate in the 1980s186. While subjectivists insisted that the victim&rsquo;s consciousness is 
required for compensation to be awarded, objectivists claimed that this is not a 
legal requirement and that compensation is to be paid regardless of subjective 
evidence of pain and suffering. The Court of Cassation embraced the objective 
position, ruling that compensation of damage is not contingent upon the victim&rsquo;s 
perception, but is to be based on the judge&rsquo;s objective assessment of the alleged 
damage187. The moral basis lies in the recognition that though in a vegetative state, 
a victim remains a human being and may feel joy or pain. The inability to move 
around and to communicate with caregivers and loved ones is undisputedly actual 
harm. Denying compensation to the allegedly unconscious would mean we regard 
such victims as dead, or as things, which is contrary to human dignity. From a 
strictly legal standpoint, the issue resides in certainty of damage: the point might 
be made that the existence of damage is uncertain. It is important that plaintiffs 
establish undisputable harm, like incapability to move, to emerge to conscious-
ness, to express thoughts and feelings.
</p>
<p>In two recent cases decided on the same day188, two victims of road accidents 
died, within one hour ( first case ) and two weeks ( second case ) following the crash. 
Their successors sought compensation for moral damage in respect of the feeling 
of loss of life expectancy suffered by the victim between accident and death. Both 
claims were dismissed due to the victims&rsquo; full loss of consciousness and absence 
of evidence that the victims could have been aware of the situation. The Court 
of Cassation affirmed this ruling, using wording showing deference to the lower 
judges as regards the determination of the certainty of damage. After all, the exist-
ence of the feelings in question was conjectural and lacked certainty. A 2013 judg-
ment caused some to wonder whether the Court of Cassation might be returning 
to a subjective approach189: the Court approved a Court of Appeal judgment reduc-
ing damages granted to compensate a victim&rsquo;s suffering by half ( &euro; 5,000 instead of 
&euro; 10,000 ), due to almost instantaneous death, hereby relying on the lower court&rsquo;s 
factual findings. The dismissal of the claim based on loss of a chance to survive 
was confirmed. The appellate judges had rightly observed that any right to live up 
to a statistically determinate age is insufficiently certain, because of the aleatory 
character of human life, risk of disease, etc. There is no subjective element in the 
judgment.

<p>41Part 5&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;basic&emsp;criteria&emsp;for&emsp;a&emsp;compensation&emsp;claim
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>Indirect victims may also claim compensation for their non-pecuniary dam-
age, such as their suffering upon the loss of a dear one or suffering due to the fact 
that the direct victim is in a vegetative state190.
</p>
<p>The compensation of bodily damage is usually accompanied by compensa-
tion of non-pecuniary damage191. An official list ( Nomenclature Dintilhac ) includes, 
inter alia, deficits ( lack or impairment in a functional capacity ), pain, &raquo; pr&eacute;judice 
esth&eacute;tique &laquo; ( disfigurement ), sexual impairment, damage caused by evolutive pa-
thology, etc., a list that opponents find shockingly long and unreflective of the 
unity of the person192. The list simply reflects the multiple possible miseries of our 
human condition.
</p>
<p>Non-pecuniary damage linked to infringement of personality rights is an-
other big chapter, which has generated abundant literature193. The fact that mon-
etary compensation of this type of damage may be the only way to sanction an in-
fringement of personality rights is not disputed, and a sufficient amount must be 
awarded to serve both as a sanction and a deterrent194. The problem is that such 
rights can be monetized ( Koziol  talks about commercialisation )195. The bound-
ary between extra-patrimonial and patrimonial rights then becomes a thin one, 
not easy to draw196. The right everyone has to one&rsquo;s own image and privacy under 
French law197 may serve as an example. A case decided in Paris in 1975 featured 
French superstar Catherine Deneuve suing a male magazine that had published 
photos of her in the nude with the story of her intimate life under the title &raquo; Cathe-
rine Deneuve superbe star &laquo;198. She had consented to the publication of photos 
taken at a time when she was acting as a professional model, occasionally pos-
ing in the nude. The magazine which then published said photos sold them to 
another magazine that republished them years later, at a time when Catherine

<p>zine owned the pictures, Catherine Deneuve was allowed to object to the publica-
tion and argue that her personality right to her image had been invaded199. The 
court held that the magazine should have requested her consent prior to publi-
cation. Any attorney or scholar familiar with French cases knows that the more a 
person protects her privacy or image rights, the more likely she is to be awarded 
higher damages in the case of an infringement of such rights. In contrast, famous 
people who usually tolerate the publication of gossip and photos taken within the 
realm of their private life, though not losing the right to protection &mdash; which af-
ter all is inalienable and may not be abandoned &mdash; are more likely than not to get 
minimal or nominal damages. Given the fact that tabloids will publish gossip any-
way to maximise their sales, celebrities, by choosing not to tolerate any infringe-
ment, can monetize their private life and image by selling ex ante the right to pub-
lish under pre-determined conditions, or collecting ex post in the form of damages 
that French courts try to keep sufficiently high to serve as a deterrent.
</p>
<p>Koziol seems to favour the compensation of non-pecuniary harm to legal en-
tities, based on the argument that they may have personality rights. He cites the 
work of Fellner200, who &raquo; points out that personality rights are intended to regulate 
co-existence within society and that legal entities are also members of this society 
and participate in legal relations &laquo;201. Both points cannot be denied but are loosely 
connected. This standpoint may disregard the strong link between personality 
rights and human dignity. Dignity deals with self-esteem and intimate feelings 
connecting with what makes us human beings. Legal entities do not share such 
feelings, they are not conscious beings202. Personality rights go beyond the con-
cept of personality, which is a human and legal construct. They echo our human 
nature. Legal entities are convenient fictions that allow human beings to trade 
and defend collective interests. One would not give corporations a right to vote at 
political elections, a right not to be sold because this would be slavery, or a right 
to paternity or maternity though they may be parent companies. The author of 
this chapter strongly objects to the United States Supreme Court&rsquo;s recognition of 
a right of speech for legal entities203, which allows those who control big business 
to have the corporation spend unlimited amounts of money to finance electoral 
campaigns. Does membership in society and participation in legal relations trans-

<p>199 The accompanying text telling the actress&rsquo; love stories, which had earlier on been known to the 
public, was equally regarded an infringement, since she had been very discreet in more recent 
years, not tolerating any gossip about her alleged liaisons. Substantial damages were awarded 
to compensate infringements to both image and privacy rights.

<p>form corporations to full citizens ? With respect, the recognition of fundamental 
rights such as political rights or personality rights of legal entities may at the end 
of the day undermine the protection of human rights.
</p>
<p>French courts accept compensation of non-pecuniary damage suffered by le-
gal entities204, while not going as far as bestowing personality rights upon them. 
Though serving practical purposes in cases where pure economic loss is difficult 
to assess205, this jurisprudence is based on false ontological premises.
</p>
<p>Koziol discusses at length compensation of impairment of leisure time and 
holiday, which he finds difficult to pin down between pecuniary and non-pecuni-
ary damage206. Not much is to be found on the topic in French law &ndash; if anything, 
at least after superficial research. It is clear that the expense of renting a replace-
ment when an object ( eg a car ) is damaged is pecuniary damage. However, what 
about awarding damages even when the victim does not rent a car, just because 
there has been loss of use207 ? Under French law, compensation must cover the en-
tire loss but should not exceed it208. It is therefore difficult to imagine how a court 
could award damages to compensate the cost of car rental where the victim sim-
ply used alternative transportation at no additional cost. A real life example: my 
car was damaged in an accident during family vacations in Tuscany. There is no 
doubt that the party at fault had to compensate the cost of one-week&rsquo;s car rental; 
this was pecuniary damage covered by liability insurance. However, the car could 
not be completely repaired in Italy within the remaining week of our seasonal stay. 
We consequently abandoned our plan of spending an additional week moving on 
to the Lakes and Tyrol, drove back to Lyon and had the car fully repaired before re-
suming normal activity. My family and I were deprived of one-week&rsquo;s vacation. Did 
we suffer a non-pecuniary loss ( the grief of being deprived of a third of our vaca-
tion time ), or a pecuniary loss ( the reasonable cost of this additional week based 
on our spending patterns ) ? Unless we actually spent this additional money ( plus 
extra car rental and the money to have our car fully repaired in Italy or returned 
unrepaired to Lyon ) to have our three-week holiday despite the difficulties, there 
is no extra pecuniary damage. This is a situation where as victims we had the op-
tion of either maximising our loss with a chance of compensation, or minimising 
it. Damages might be fair to the victim who mitigates, and yet of an ambiguous 
nature if awarded: compensation of pecuniary damage where the award covers the

amount. No law suit was filed and the action is prescribed.
</p>
<p>Had I claimed compensation for the cost of a one-week holiday, I might have 
faced the objection that the damage was not direct209. The direct cause of the al-
leged loss was after all my decision to shorten the holiday. However, since my de-
cision was reasonable, it did not break the chain of causation. I could have recov-
ered non-pecuniary damages for additional stress and loss of a chance of reducing 
this stress by extended vacation. The distinction between  dommage or  damnum 
and pr&eacute;judice or praejudicium makes sense in this context: the &raquo; damnum &laquo; was the 
damage to the car. The &raquo; pr&eacute;judice &laquo; or recoverable damage consists in the cost of 
towing and repair plus incidentals such as rental of a replacement vehicle as far 
as pecuniary damage is concerned. It may also include some additional non-pecu-
niary damage, compensation of which may possibly help the victim afford some 
limited extra good time, which after all may be fair in the circumstances. Granting 
the full cost of the additional vacation week as compensation of pecuniary dam-
age would not be right because the expense was not incurred, the victim as it were 
being caused to save money.
</p>
<p>C. The principle of full compensation
</p>
<p>Compensation of real and calculable damage calls for limited comment from a 
French perspective. Though the Civil Code makes no provision, the idea of full 
restoration ( reparation in kind ) or full compensation ( by equivalent, in the form 
of damages ) is a fundamental principle of compensation law210. Also, damages 
have to be assessed regardless of the degree of fault causing the damage211.
</p>
<p>The case of unwanted birth troubles French scholars212 as much as it does 
other Europeans213. The birth of a child does not in itself constitute damage, a so-
lution proclaimed both by administrative214 and ordinary courts215. However, both 
sets of courts accept that compensation may be possible in exceptional circum-

<p>stances216, or when special damage occurs in addition to the normal expenses gen-
erated by maternity217.
</p>
<p>The exception stems from the fact that it is not the birth and the onus of 
child rearing that generates the damage but special suffering linked to the birth 
of a particular child, such as pregnancy caused by rape or incest218. Administra-
tive courts also accept that the birth of a handicapped or malformed child upsets 
normal life conditions and may therefore generate recoverable damage219. When 
caused by the tortfeasor or by medical malpractice, the child&rsquo;s handicap is to be 
compensated220. Viney is of the opinion that the mother should recover when in a 
situation of financial distress221.
</p>
<p>Last but not least, it is to be remembered that in the very famous and controver-
sial Perruche case222, the Plenary Assembly of the Court of Cassation accepted that 
the child had a cause of action and a right to compensation in the case of wrong-
ful life. An anomaly had been misdiagnosed during pregnancy, the mother having 
made it clear, at an early stage of pregnancy, that she would rather abort than take 
the chance of having a handicapped child. She was compensated223, but the action 
conducted on behalf of the child was more problematic, as it came down to com-
pensation for the mere fact of being alive. The Court concluded, however, that the 
child was &raquo; entitled to compensation for the damage resulting from such handicap 
and caused by the established failure to perform &laquo;  the duty to take due care when 
conducting the antenatal investigations, at a stage where pregnancy could still be le-
gally interrupted224. Although the Court had characterised the handicap, rather than 
wrongful life, as the recoverable damage, public opinion was outraged225. Legisla-
tion overturned this ruling, a law of 2002 providing that &raquo; [ n ] o one may rely on dam-
age caused by the mere fact of one&rsquo;s birth&laquo;226 and making provision for coverage 
of major handicap by way of national solidarity rather than tort law in such cases.

<p>II. Causation
</p>
<p>Civil Code provisions regarding delictual liability are silent on causation, only mak-
ing it a requirement by the repeated use of the verb &raquo; cause &laquo;227. More is said in pro-
visions regarding contractual liability, found to be applicable to contractual and 
extra-contractual liability228. Art 1151 provides: &raquo; Even in the case where the non-per-
formance of the agreement is due to the obligor&rsquo;s intentional fault, damages may 
include, with respect to the loss suffered by the obligee and the profit which he has 
been deprived of, only what is an immediate and direct consequence of the non-per-
formance of the agreement. &laquo; This is rather vague language, much like what is to 
be found in other Romanist codes: the Civil Code of Poland limits liability to dam-
age that is the normal consequence of wrongful action or omission229; Italy refers 
by analogy to the Penal Code, saying that subsequent causes break the causal link 
between a former cause and the damage, when they suffice on their own to explain 
the damage230; Portugal refers to the &raquo; conditio sine qua non &laquo;231. In France, much 
like in all Romanist systems, one must refer to jurisprudence. Rather than finding 
inspiration in complex doctrinal developments, French courts adopt a pragmatic 
approach and find ways to get around complex problems.
</p>
<p>A. Causation in doctrine: a complex debate
</p>
<p>The concept of &raquo; cause&laquo; is primarily philosophical. However, philosophical or sci-
entific definitions of causation are of little use in the legal world. Whereas philos-
ophers and scientists try to move up from known or observed phenomena to un-
known causes, jurists try to determine a causal link between two known facts, the 
damaging event and the actual damage232. Causation is abundantly discussed in 
French doctrine233. However, French scholars shy at giving a definition of legal cau-
</p>
<p>227 Art 1382: &raquo; Any act whatever of man, which causes damage to another, obliges the one by whose 
fault it occurred, to compensate it. &laquo; Art 1383: &raquo; Everyone is liable for the damage he causes not 
only by his intentional act, but also by his negligent conduct or by his imprudence. &laquo; Art 1384: 
&raquo; A person is liable not only for the damage he causes by his own act, but also for that which is 
caused by the acts of persons for whom he is responsible, or by things which are in his custody. &laquo;

<p>sation and prefer a common law inspired pragmatic approach, if one were to cite 
Tony Honor&eacute;   234. Ripert wrote that &raquo; causation has been the object of brilliant doc- 
trinal studies that never brought a solution to this general problem, which may 
never be solved &laquo;  235.  Starck  and  Esmein  agreed that causation resists academic 
analysis236. Honor&eacute; insists that the doctrine of risk has marked France more than 
any other jurisdiction, the French proposing risk not only as a substitute to fault 
but also to causation237. Viney, however, is of the opinion that risk analysis has a 
limited impact in jurisprudence238. The doctrine of Aquilian relativity has had a 
greater impact. It is policy oriented and based on objective analysis of the norm 
to be applied; it insists on the determination of the damage that it wants to com-
pensate239. The Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation has endorsed this ap-
proach, for instance by refusing compensation to alleged victims when a criminal 
law aims at protecting a general interest rather than private individuals240. French 
scholars tend to resist the Aquilian solution noting that it is as difficult to operate 
as causation itself241.
</p>
<p>Influenced by Germanic doctrines242, French scholars managed to clarify some 
aspects of causation. Two conceptions of causation have been particularly influen-
tial. According to a first doctrine, damage is caused by a number of events, stem-
ming from human action or inaction as well as external circumstances. From the 
moment any of these events appears to be a conditio sine qua non of the damage, 
it is to be regarded as a cause. Naturally, irrelevant causes may be ignored. This 
doctrine is known as equivalency of conditions ( &eacute;quivalence des conditions )243. It is 
criticised by those who favour proximity ( proximit&eacute; des causes ) and believe that 
causation is only to be found in the most closely connected event, which may be 
decided on the basis of time factors, efficiency in producing the damaging result, 
probability, or foreseeability244. However, the notion of &raquo; causa proxima &laquo; is not very 
successful in France, nor are doctrines of efficient causation or direct causation245.

</p>
<p>An equally popular doctrine is that of adequacy of causation ( causalit&eacute; ad&eacute;-
quate )246. Among several causes, only the one that carries the objective possibility 
of the result may be regarded as the legal cause. This is based on some objective 
necessity, and presupposes an examination of the findings in the light of science 
and experience247. This doctrine has the advantage of avoiding the dilution of 
causes: indeed, equivalency of conditions seems to imply that each condition by 
itself is nothing, causation existing in their conjunction. However, its focus on the 
likelihood and foreseeability of damage may cause the judgment to be more nor-
mative and to drift away from factual causation. It has a strong normative over-
tone that may lead to some confusion between causation and fault248.
</p>
<p>Neither doctrine is fully satisfactory either in logic or in practice. Equivalency 
of conditions seems to be preferable when it comes to determining whether cau-
sation exists as a matter of fact, but adequacy of causation may be more helpful 
when it comes to proof249. Equivalency of conditions is more factually exact in 
the sense that likely or foreseeable damage does not necessarily occur ( we may 
have fault and adequate causation and yet no damage ensues ), whilst on the other 
hand, because of an unfortunate combination of causes, a normatively normal sit-
uation may lead to catastrophic harm. A fact necessary to the occurrence of harm 
must have contributed to causation. Foreseeability or probability may be signs 
of causation, whereas necessity establishes what one wants to prove, making the 
mere signs useless250. However, a party will not be made liable just because the 
causal link is necessary; it needs to be an apt way to explain intellectually why the 
damage occurred, as a consequence of fault or defect in a thing251. When it comes 
to proving the existence of causation, there are countless situations where it is al-
most impossible to say that without the occurrence, the damage would not have 
happened. Viney and  Jourdain give several examples252. When a patient sees his 
condition worsen, are we sure that it is caused by the alleged medical negligence ? 
Can we say for sure that a disease is caused by the vicinity of a nuclear plant, or 
that a car would not have been stolen had it been locked properly, since after all 
it is not that difficult to steal a locked car ? Presumptions are used in these cases, 
based on probability and foreseeability, adequacy of causation thus taking the 
lead. Moving from theory to practice, the approach becomes pragmatic.

<p>B. Causation in jurisprudence: a pragmatic approach
</p>
<p>The French Court of Cassation checks how lower courts apply causation, rightly 
refusing to consider it a pure question of fact that could be left to the discretion 
of lower courts. Doctrinal discussions indicate how causation connects facts to 
normativity. The only aspect in relation to which the Court of Cassation occasion-
ally defers to the discretion of lower courts is proof of causation253, which does not 
mean that the highest Court abandons all review power regarding proof254. In recent 
cases the Court of Cassation has insisted that proof of causation may be induced 
from facts and circumstances wherefrom judges may infer presumptions, typi-
cally in cases of medical malpractice where matters get scientific and technical255.
</p>
<p>Many cases may be cited where the Court of Cassation exerts its review pow-
ers256: it acts in a very pragmatic manner, avoiding making pronouncements by 
way of general rule or giving general statements257. Viney and Jourdain observe that 
it takes careful analysis and comparison of the many cases in order to understand 
the content and contours of rules governing causation258. They note that the task 
is complicated by the fact that the Court tends to merge its judgment on fault and 
causation, especially when it asserts that lower judges &raquo; may have found ( or not 
found ) the existence ( or absence ) of fault and causal link with the damage. &laquo;259 
This is another area where the brevity of the highest Court pronouncements does 
not help the interpreter, but makes room for needed practical adjustments.
</p>
<p>French courts will exclude liability every time it can be proved that without 
the alleged fact, the damage would nonetheless have occurred260. However, the 
fact will be accepted as a cause when it made the damage more serious ( aggrava-
tion du dommage )261. To be a cause, the event must have contributed to the oc-
currence or aggravation of damage. As a rule, all conditions necessary to such 
occurrence or aggravation may be regarded as causal. The fact that an external 
cause also intervened does not prevent the liability of the tortfeasor, provided that

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>his act was also a conditio sine qua non. In the famous case of the sinking of the 
Lamorici&egrave;re steamer262, the ship-owner who was at fault for using poor-quality 
coal during a storm at sea was partly exonerated ( by 4 / 5 ) due to the tempest that 
contributed to the damage. More recent cases rejected exoneration in similar cir-
cumstances, making the tortfeasor fully liable ( responsabilit&eacute; int&eacute;grale ), in cases 
where the outside circumstance was predictable and resistible, falling short of 
constituting force majeure263.
</p>
<p>When several causes occur successively, French jurisprudence is not driven 
by the idea of proximate cause264. Cases may be found, however, where the clos-
est cause in time is regarded as triggering full liability, such as in a case where 
the ambulance transporting a victim injured in a first accident gets involved in 
a second car crash causing the victim&rsquo;s death: the pre-existing condition was not 
taken into account and the second driver was made fully liable265. In more com-
plex cases with multiple causes, fault seems to prevail over causation. This was 
certainly the case in a situation where two drivers, one of whom was in a state of 
intoxication, were racing against one another on a public highway266. While the 
inebriated driver was passing another car, the second &raquo; racer &laquo; overtook from third 
position and collided with his adversary&rsquo;s car, which he was overtaking, and with 
a third vehicle coming towards him. The accident resulted in a number of deaths 
and injuries, notably involving the passengers in the defendants&rsquo; cars and one 
of the two &raquo; racers &laquo;, who was himself killed. Criminal proceedings were brought 
against the surviving &raquo; racer &laquo;, while the victims had their civil case for damages 
heard by the criminal court. The Court of Appeal found the defendant not guilty 
on the grounds that it was difficult to establish a causal relationship between his 
behaviour and the harm caused. The judges reasoned that the surviving negligent 
driver had overtaken more &raquo; normally &laquo; than his adversary, who then collided with 
him, and had been &raquo; led on &laquo; by his friend&rsquo;s attitude.
</p>
<p>The Court of Cassation did not accept these arguments. The court found that 
the defendant&rsquo;s various violations of the Highway Code had a &raquo; global character &laquo; 
that &raquo; automatically applied to the indivisible interlinking of the acts described &laquo;.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>The Court of Appeal should have considered &raquo; whether, by taking part in a danger-
ous activity and by creating through their unwiseness &ndash; even if it was not possible 
to determine the direct involvement of the acts carried out by each of them &ndash; a 
grave risk of which third parties were the victims, the two drivers had not com-
mitted a faute commune ( &raquo; joint fault &laquo; ) for which [ the surviving &raquo; racer &laquo; ] should 
therefore be assigned the consequences in terms of compensation. &laquo; The survivor 
should pay damages for the consequence of both drivers&rsquo; joint actions, as &raquo; faute 
commune &laquo; gives rise to solidary liability under French law.
</p>
<p>Likewise, when an accident is caused by a stolen car, in circumstances where 
the negligence of the owner facilitated the theft, the thief&rsquo;s fault will prevail over 
the negligence of the owner so that the thief&rsquo;s fault will be recognised as the cause 
of the damage267. Hence comes the concept of causal fault ( faute causale ) devel-
oped by Dejean de La B&acirc;tie, strongly connecting fault and causation268. This takes 
us back to the idea of adequacy, which is also to be found in cases of no-fault li-
ability. When the damage is caused by a thing in someone&rsquo;s custody, the causal 
role of the thing in relation to the damage is presumed when the thing was mov-
ing ( eg damage caused by a bicycle ), as it must have played some &raquo; active role &laquo; in 
producing the damage. When the thing is not in motion, one must prove that the 
thing was abnormal. In a recent case269, the victim was injured as a consequence 
of stepping against the ten-centimetre high concrete curb separating the parking 
space from the pedestrian entrance of a shopping mall. The victim sued the own-
ers of the mall on the basis of art 1384 para 1 of the Civil Code, alleging that the 
cause was the act of the curb, a thing that was in the owners&rsquo; custody. The claim 
was dismissed and the Court of Cassation affirmed: the curb was in good condi-
tion, it was painted in white and was therefore visible to a normally careful person, 
and it was possible to reach the stores without walking over it. In conclusion, the 
curb played no active role in the fall of the victim. One may note that this almost 
comes down to deciding that there had been no causal negligence on the part of 
the owners of the mall. French liability for the act of a thing does not fully qualify 
as strict liability.

<p>C. The attenuation of the causation requirement
</p>
<p>In particular cases where there are multiple tortfeasors or uncertainty of causa-
tion, various doctrines are applied where the causation requirement is attenu-
ated270.
</p>
<p>1. Multiple tortfeasors, concurrent and alternative causes
</p>
<p>French jurisprudence does not accept that a victim may be undercompensated 
just because one or several of the tortfeasors may be unknown. For the sake of 
justice, French law also tries to avoid shifting the whole burden of compensation 
onto those tortfeasors who have been identified271.
</p>
<p>Hunting  accidents provide a classical example. Some reverse engineering is 
needed to understand the law pertaining to compensation of victims of such ac-
cidents. Victims must be compensated and will be compensated. If no tortfeasor 
is identified, this will be done by a compensation fund272. If one hunter has been 
shooting, he may be held liable unless he can prove that his shotgun was pointed 
in another direction, shot another type of bullet, or that it was defective at the 
time. Liability may then fall onto other identified hunters or an application for 
compensation may be filed to the compensation fund. If several hunters may have 
caused the damage, they can be made liable under one of the following doctrines: 
fault-based liability ( faute commune, faute collective ), if acting as a group and 
guilty of a collective fault273; custody of the bullets when two guns shot simulta- 
neously and at least two bullets hit the victim ( gerbe unique )274; or collective or 
joint custody of the bullets, also triggering strict liability for the act of a thing 
under art 1384 para 1275. If only one hunter is identified, this hunter would most 
probably be made fully liable, and this would not be regarded as inequitable since 
every hunter must by law carry third-party liability insurance. If this hunter is un-
insured or insolvent, recourse shall be had to the compensation fund.

</p>
<p>A scenario quite similar to the hunters&rsquo; case can be found in a recent DES or 
Distilb&egrave;ne case276. A woman suffered vaginal cancer allegedly caused by the fact 
that her own mother had been administered diethylstilboestrol or DES during 
pregnancy. No evidence was found of the details of the treatment: no prescrip-
tion, no medical record ( the doctor who treated the mother had died, and the re-
cord had disappeared ). However, experts ascertained that the claimant&rsquo;s pathol-
ogy was the consequence of her mother taking DES while pregnant. In addition, 
the victim&rsquo;s parents certified that the mother had taken Distilb&egrave;ne at that time, a 
fact corroborated by other witnesses. The victim sued UCB Pharma and Novartis, 
two companies that had produced and marketed diethylstilboestrol in France at 
the time, one under the name of Distilb&egrave;ne, and the other one under the generic 
name. However, everyone used the name Distilb&egrave;ne at the time, even to describe 
the generic DES. The victim could not prove which of the two companies had pro-
duced the substance her mother had taken. The Court of Cassation ruled that 
each of the two defendants had to prove that its product had not caused the dam-
age, thereby creating a rebuttable presumption of causation. The two producers 
happened to supply the same commodity at the same time, rather than forming a 
group such as sports people or hunters in the typical cases. The judgment is based 
on the probability that one or the other of the two defendants caused the damage. 
It seems that the Court of Cassation decision is conducive of a 50-50 judgment, 
which may not be fair in the circumstances. At the time of the facts, UCB Pharma&rsquo;s 
market share was 80 to 90 %, leaving only 10 to 20 % to Novartis. Solidarity is not to 
be excluded, but Novartis&rsquo;s share should not exceed 20 %.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the case may fall under two different provisions of the Princi-
ples of European Tort Law ( PETL ) regarding causation277. It may be regarded as a 
situation of concurrent causes. According to art 3 : 102, &raquo; In case of multiple activi-
ties, where each of them alone would have caused the damage at the same time, 
each activity is regarded as a cause of the victim&rsquo;s damage.&laquo; This leads to solidarity 
because we have multiple tortfeasors278. Art 3 : 103( 2 ) ( alternative causes ) may be a 
better fit279: &raquo; In case of multiple activities, where each of them alone would have 
been sufficient to cause the damage, but it remains uncertain which one in fact 
caused it, each activity is regarded as a cause to the extent corresponding to the

</p>
<p>likelihood that it may have caused the victim&rsquo;s damage.&laquo; The European Group on 
Tort Law agreed that in cases of mass torts the burden of proof should not be too 
heavy on the victim280, which is precisely what the Court of Cassation is consider-
ing when creating a presumption of causation. The Court did not rule on whether 
liability is joint or solidary. Logically, alternative causation excludes solidarity281.
</p>
<p>We do not know whether in the above case the victim&rsquo;s mother took medi-
cation manufactured by  one producer only, which may be one or the other ( al-
ternative causes ). She may have been treated with the product of one, and then 
with that of the other282, during the time of the pregnancy, in which case we have 
concurrent causes. The good news is that both articles lead to the same solution, 
though the &raquo; alternative causes &laquo; provision is more conducive of proportional li-
ability, which looks like the best solution in this case. The French Court of Cas-
sation ruled in compliance with the Principles of European Tort Law, even before 
the publication of the French edition by the &raquo; Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de l&eacute;gislation compar&eacute;e &laquo;283.
</p>
<p>Another case decided by the same 1st Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation, 
on 17 June 2010284, confirms the willingness of the Court to rely on presumptions 
of causation. A man had contracted a nosocomial infection after having spent 
time in two different hospitals but it was impossible to prove in which hospital 
he had actually contracted the infection. The Court ruled that &raquo; where there is evi-
dence of a nosocomial infection but the latter may have been contracted in several 
health institutions, each of those whose liability is sought has to prove that it did 
not cause the infection. &raquo; Though the facts are different, this is exactly what the 
Court ruled in the Distilb&egrave;ne case, in a case of alternative causes under the PETL285.
</p>
<p>In cases of multiple tortfeasors, French courts apportion the loss among the 
individual tortfeasors making them liable in solidum, and leave an uncompen-
sated share to the victim based on his or her fault or negligence where he or she 
contributed to the damage. Where the individual share of each contributor cannot 
be identified, the court will apportion by virile share, dividing the whole amount 
by the number of contributors, each being liable in solidum. This applies to the 
example of a plaintiff attacked by several dogs, each belonging to a different owner. 
Unless one owner proves by exclusion that her dog is too small to have caused a 
major injury, the court will not be tempted to apportion otherwise. The fact that

</p>
<p>two out of the three dog owners are found negligent is irrelevant under French law. 
Liability is strict and is based on the ownership or use of the animal286.
</p>
<p>In asbestos cases, supposing that a victim worked five years with one liable 
employer and twenty years with another, the court may apportion on the basis of 
duration unless it can be shown that the sanitary situation was significantly worse 
with one or the other employer. The Court of Cassation will regard apportionment 
as a matter of fact and will not give a particular guideline287.
</p>
<p>2.  Uncertainty of causation and loss of a chance
</p>
<p>French courts routinely apply the doctrine of loss of a chance ( perte d&rsquo;une chance ) 
whenever they are of the opinion that the defendant&rsquo;s activity deprived the victim 
of the opportunity of a favourable event when the victim can do nothing to rem-
edy the situation. Loss of a chance is regarded as direct and certain damage. The 
French find it convenient to shift from causation to damage288. Rather than admit-
ting that causation is partial or uncertain and follow a path similar to arts 3 : 101 to 
3 : 106 PETL, French courts regard loss of a chance as a head of damage that will be 
fully compensated289. As unorthodox as things may look from a theoretical point 
of view, it serves very pragmatic purposes and has spread to other countries, both 
in the Romanist and Germanic branches of the civil law family290.
</p>
<p>Loss of a chance is frequently applied in cases of medical malpractice. As 
noted above291, causation is tricky in medical malpractice cases due to scientific 
uncertainty. In a recent case292, a child was born in a clinic with severe and mul-
tiple handicaps caused by a neurological disorder. The parents sued the general 
practitioner and the gynaecologist who monitored the pregnancy. They also sued 
the clinic where the mother delivered the child, together with the midwife, an 
employee of the clinic. All defendants were found liable in solidum for fault or 
negligence during the pregnancy and at the time of childbirth. They had proved 
that, unknown to the doctors at the time of the facts, the mother had a pre-exist-

<p>ing condition that, in the opinion of experts, had a decisive but non-measurable 
influence on the handicap. However, the Court of Cassation concluded that the 
defendants&rsquo; faults had in part caused the damage, thus justifying solidary liability 
for loss of a chance on the part of the child to experience a lesser degree of cere-
bral infirmity, &raquo; regardless of the degree of uncertainty of the first origin of the 
handicap.&laquo; Based on the judgment of the lower court, the victims were therefore 
to receive 75 % compensation.
</p>
<p>This is a typical example where to some extent, but to an unknown extent, the 
loss derives from the victim&rsquo;s sphere, since the mother had been suffering from a 
pre-existing condition. The point was discussed at length by the European Group 
on Tort Law. According to art 3 : 106 PETL, &raquo; The victim has to bear his loss to the 
extent corresponding to the likelihood that it may have been caused by an activ-
ity, occurrence or other circumstance within his own sphere. &raquo; The Comments give 
the example of a medical malpractice case with a victim falling seriously ill, where 
&raquo; the illness may well have a &rsaquo;natural&lsaquo; cause. The doctor is liable to the extent his 
malpractice may have caused the illness. &laquo; 293
</p>
<p>Applying the doctrine of the loss of a chance to our case leads to a similar 
result. Rather than lamenting on an unorthodox use of loss of a chance294, one 
cannot but trust judges to make a reasonable assessment as to the percentage of 
liability to be assigned to the defendant, when challenged with inconclusive evi-
dence. In such doubtful cases, proportional liability is no doubt to be preferred to 
an &raquo; all-or-nothing &laquo; approach. French pragmatism favours fiction over reliance on 
firm legal doctrine.
</p>
<p>French law only allows for the compensation of a loss that is actual and cer-
tain295. The compensation of uncertain future loss is not permissible unless re-
garded as a loss of a chance296. French doctrine has identified two types of future 
losses297. The loss is virtual ( pr&eacute;judice virtuel ) where it potentially exists as a con-
sequence of the blameworthy conduct: all the conditions for its existence in the

<p>future already exist at the time of the facts, much like an embryo contains all the 
elements necessary for the development of a human life. The loss is hypothetical 
( pr&eacute;judice &eacute;ventuel ) where its existence depends on events that may or may not 
occur, much like the eventuality of a human being coming to exist when two per-
sons of the opposite sex and able to procreate have intimate intercourse. If a CEO 
is prevented from concluding a promising contract because of an accident, the 
loss of benefit is regarded as hypothetical, since no-one knows whether the con-
tract would have been concluded had the CEO not been prevented from conduct-
ing the negotiation298. The line is thin however, and one may want to decide that 
the CEO was presently and certainly deprived of a favourable opportunity, which 
is the test to decide whether a loss of a chance exists according to the most recent 
jurisprudence299.
</p>
<p>A loss has to be virtual, not hypothetical, in order to be compensated as a loss 
of a chance. This may happen in cases where the occurrence of any future harm 
is uncertain, but also where the scope of the future harm is uncertain. Rather 
than considering the harm complained of and addressing uncertain causation, 
the French take for granted that the perpetrator deprived the victim of the possi-
bility of an uncertain advantage and gain and regard this lost chance as damage.
</p>
<p>In the example of the CEO who was prevented from concluding a promising 
contract due to an accident, the occurrence of future harm is uncertain: nobody 
can tell for sure that the deal would have been concluded. French law applies a 
form of proportional liability whenever judges find that the plaintiff was presently 
and certainly deprived of a favourable opportunity. As explained above, compen-
sation will be apportioned in the sense that it will be calculated as a share of the 
plaintiff&rsquo;s various heads of damage.
</p>
<p>The compensation of loss of a chance in such situations has caused no unrea-
sonable surge in litigation. On the other hand, compensation of loss of a chance 
has caused no known increased deterrence in the exercise of professional activity 
such as legal or medical practice. In dubious cases, courts are more than likely to 
describe the loss as hypothetical and reject the claim, as eventually happened in 
the CEO case.
</p>
<p>Cases in which harm has already been caused but the scope of this harm in 
the future is unknown are common. All cases where a victim suffers personal in-
jury causing some form of disability seem to fall into this category. The loss of 
vision in an eye, the limitation in the use of an arm, or the loss of the ability to 
procreate, is no doubt existing harm. However, the scope of the loss for the future 
is unknown. The young person losing the opportunity to procreate may elect for 
a lifestyle where this causes no impediment or may be deprived of the chance of

a chance.

<p>However, French courts are likely to indemnify such loss as &raquo; pr&eacute;judice 
d&rsquo;agr&eacute;ment &laquo;. This may cover the loss of a precise activity such as the possibility 
to do sports or to play the violin, in situations where the victim had already some

standing of the pr&eacute;judice d&rsquo;agr&eacute;ment would be &raquo; elitist &laquo;301, expressing support for 
its extension to the general arrangement of a normal life, as sometimes defined by 
the courts302. This is a form of non-pecuniary damage, the assessment of which is 
of course problematic, and will never be fully adequate in the parties&rsquo; eyes.

<p>Part 6 The elements of liability
</p>
<p>I. Wrongfulness and fault under French law
</p>
<p>From a French perspective, wrongfulness does not appear as an external require-
ment in addition to fault, but as an element of fault. Unlike the Italian Civil Code, 
which under Germanic influence expressly requires wrongfulness as a condition 
for liability in addition to fault303, the French Civil Code requires the existence of 
fault without making reference to wrongfulness304. When discussing fault, authors 
traditionally consider that it includes an objective element ( illic&eacute;it&eacute;, meaning 
wrongfulness ) and a subjective one ( imputabilit&eacute;, meaning a moral element )305. 
Recent developments lead to doubt as to the relevance or usefulness of the sub-
jective element, now that the law accepts that infants and mentally ill people may 
be liable for wrongful acts. A doctrine of objective fault has developed, leading to 
confusion: in the opinion of some scholars, fault comes to mean wrongfulness, or 
wrongfulness becomes the only element of fault306. Whatever language is used in 
describing the matter, this indicates that wrongfulness is and remains the core el-
ement of fault-based liability.
</p>
<p>Wrongfulness also remains an important element of no-fault liability for the 
act of a thing under one&rsquo;s custody and liability for others307. This statement may 
sound unacceptable or at the very least questionable from the pen of a French-
educated scholar and would be circled in red on a student exam paper. Since, ac-
cording to the French, wrongfulness is depicted as an element of fault, how could 
it play a role in no-fault liability ? This is where comparative law helps elucidate 
the mysteries of one&rsquo;s own legal system. We will see that wrongfulness plays a key 
role in this context, though in an indirect manner.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>A. Wrongfulness as the core element of fault
</p>
<p>Traditionally, fault is said to imply the existence of an act or omission that must 
be wrongful ( illicite ) and attributable ( imputable ) to the actor308. It includes an 
objective element consisting in the violation of a duty or a legal obligation, and a 
subjective element, that some call guilt ( culpabilit&eacute; ) and others imputability ( im-
putabilit&eacute; ), this latter term indicating that the act is psychologically attributable 
to the tortfeasor309. There is a huge amount of literature and controversy around 
these notions, and recent developments in French law did not help to make mat-
ters any clearer. Rather than opening the debate and taking sides, this section will 
focus on core notions and will propose an outside analysis of contemporary evo-
lutions.
</p>
<p>1. The permanence of the objective element
</p>
<p>Planiol defined fault as &raquo; the violation of a pre-existing obligation &laquo;310, a definition 
that serves as the starting point of all discussion on the subject. He was the first 
French voice insisting on the illicit dimension and the idea of breach of a duty311. 
Though the French Civil Code does not expressly require the existence of a duty 
of care, it is commonly admitted that fault means either the breach of a statutory 
duty312 or the infringement of more general duties, such as the duty to behave, in 
all circumstances, in a careful and diligent way ( devoir g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de prudence et de 
diligence )313. In this regard, violation of any mandatory legislative provision is re-
garded as fault under French law, and this is particularly true whenever criminal 
punishment is provided for314. This does not mean that French law differs from 
Germanic systems in this respect, as fault is here regarded as a synonym of wrong-
fulness, with a focus on the objective element only315. If the subjective element 
failed, there would be no criminal offence anyway, since criminal offences only ex-
ist when, in addition to the legal element ( nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege ), 
the material element combines with the moral element, which may be intent or 
negligence.

<p>61Part 6&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;elements&emsp;of&emsp;liability
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>We may say that such violations are wrongful per se, and therefore constitutive 
of fault, though it would be more accurate to say that they constitute wrongfulness, 
triggering liability only where the subjective element is present, except in those 
cases where the law dispenses with the requirement for subjective elements, such 
as cases of damage caused by infants and mentally ill people.
</p>
<p>Likewise, the infringement of clearly defined subjective rights is regarded as 
fault, especially where such rights are strongly protected316: this applies to person-
ality rights317 and to property rights318. The Court of Cassation regards the viola-
tion of such rights, which is wrongful in essence, either as fault ( citing art 1382 ), 
or as the violation of a subjective right, citing the provision serving as a founda-
tion for such right ( art 9 regarding protection of privacy, art 544 regarding owner-
ship )319. These clearly describe wrongfulness ( illic&eacute;it&eacute; ), which is purely objective, 
even where courts and authors prefer to talk about fault. The violation of a pre-
existing duty, or the infringement of an existing right, characterises the illicit ele-
ment ( wrongfulness ). French law does not require proof of a subjective element 
( imputability ) when a fundamental right is encroached, which may be reasonable 
given the priority accorded to such rights. The doctrinal recognition of the exist-
ence of personality rights320, followed by the recognition of the protection of pri-
vacy in the preliminary title of the Civil Code321, helped clarify this part of the law. 
Judges no longer need to refer to art 1382 to sanction infringements of privacy, and 
do not search for the existence of imputability: wrongfulness is sufficient when 
personality rights are infringed, and reference to art 9 suffices. There is no need to 
prove fault, not even to prove the existence of damage322, proof of infringement of 
the right already opening a right to redress323. Further additions were made to the 
Civil Code, establishing new situations where courts may find support for direct 
protection of human dignity, the human body and its elements324.

</p>
<p>Non-French readers would expect judges to adopt a balancing of interests ap-
proach when discussing the infringement of such fundamental rights, since it typ-
ically coincides with the exercise of another equally protected right on the part of 
the actor. For instance, protecting personality rights such as privacy and the right 
to one&rsquo;s image may impose restrictions on freedom of information or the freedom 
of the press. The French do not view things that way. The media may not tam-
per with personality rights without previous authorisation by the individual, and 
such authorisation is never presumed and it is interpreted restrictively325. These 
rules apply to public figures such as rock stars or politicians as well as to ordi-
nary citizens, the law conferring the same protection on everyone326. Courts do 
decide, however, that there is nothing wrong in revealing innocuous facts such as 
the birth of a fourth child of Princess Caroline de Monaco327. The image of a pub-
lic figure ( and this applies also to anonymous members of the public ) is not pro-
tected when taken in a public place where such person performs a professional 
or public duty328, subject to the informative character of the image329. But when it 
comes to privacy, the general public cannot claim to have a right to be informed of, 
for instance, the extramarital liaisons of the President of the Republic, since this 
is regarded as a strictly private matter330.
</p>
<p>Likewise, art 9-1 strengthens the protection of the presumption of innocence331, 
making the publication of the photo of a handcuffed person a criminal offence332, 
though the public has a right to be informed of criminal proceedings against pub-
lic figures. The French were shocked when former Finance Minister, then IMF Di-
rector, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was filmed and photographed handcuffed as he 
was arrested and prosecuted for the alleged rape of a maid on 13 May 2011, in a Man-

<p>hattan luxury hotel333. Tampering with the presumption of innocence is viewed as 
an infringement to a person&rsquo;s honour, characterised as a personality right, hence 
under strict protection334. However, a careful study of court decisions shows that 
freedom of the press is not completely sacrificed. The simple fact of revealing the 
identity of a person charged with a crime is not prohibited, so long as there is an 
absence of words clearly showing prejudice against the accused335.
</p>
<p>This leaves one remaining issue. What about the infringement of more gen-
eral duties, such as the duty to behave, in all circumstances, in a careful and dili-
gent way ( devoir g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de prudence et de diligence ) ? The beauty of the general 
clause enshrined in art 1382 lies in the dispensation from looking for existing texts 
or pre-existing special torts, as was the case under Roman law and ancient law. 
The standard, however, is borrowed from Roman law, as French courts tradition-
ally refer to the bonus pater familias ( bon p&egrave;re de famille ), mentioned in several ar-
ticles of the Civil Code336. The good family father represents &raquo; the normally prudent 
and diligent person, who is neither extremely vigilant, nor abnormally negligent, 
neither a hero nor a coward, neither a pure egoist nor an exceptional altruist, but 
between the two: an ordinary human being. &laquo;337 Comparison is often made with 
the common law reasonable man, lately renamed the reasonable person338. Ecolo-
gists recently moved the French National Assembly to vote for the elimination 
of the &raquo; bon p&egrave;re de famille &laquo;-standard and its replacement by a reasonableness 
test, to eliminate an allegedly sexist reference339. The traditional test conveys the 
idea that people have to be mindful of their offspring&rsquo;s interest. Doing away with 
the reference to generation would eliminate the future-oriented dimension of the 
standard. The ongoing reform neglects the fact that the reference to parenthood

found in the PETL343.
</p>
<p>Acting in accordance with the rules ( such as in sporting activities ) does not 
necessarily shield the actor from liability, as judges can be of the opinion that the 
conduct did not match the standard of reasonableness and was therefore wrong-
ful344. Likewise, the exercise of a subjective right may be deemed abusive ( abuse 
of right; abus de droit ), when the action happens to be malicious and unreason-
able345, even if the right in question is strongly protected346. The existence of mal-
ice or intentional fault brings us to the subjective element.
</p>
<p>2. The retreat of the subjective element
</p>
<p>The subjective element of fault resides in the actor&rsquo;s own awareness of his act347. 
French authors overwhelmingly recognise that fault necessarily includes a subjec-
tive element, described as a &raquo; moral &laquo; element by some and &raquo; psychological &laquo; by oth-
ers348. Whatever word is used, this tradition goes back to Canon law349, and derives 
from the philosophical foundations of civil liability and the notion of reason put 
forward by  Pothier  in the 18th century350. Full consciousness, together with the 
capacity of understanding what is being done, makes the act attributable ( imput-

<p>343 Art 4 : 102: &raquo; ( 1 ) The required standard of conduct is that of the reasonable person in the circum-
stances, and depends, in particular, on the nature and value of the protected interest involved, 
the dangerousness of the activity, the expertise to be expected of a person carrying it on, the 
foreseeability of the damage, the relationship of proximity or special reliance between those 
involved, as well as the availability and the costs of precautionary or alternative methods. ( 2 ) 
The above standard may be adjusted when due to age, mental or physical disability or due to 
extraordinary circumstances the person cannot be expected to conform to it. &laquo;

<p>able ) to the actor351. This perception is consistent with a &raquo; free will &laquo; philosophical 
approach ( libre arbitre ). It still prevails in French doctrine and in public opinion, 
despite energetic doctrinal challenges starting from the 1930s. According to &raquo; ob-
jectivist &laquo; doctrines, wrongfulness is a sufficient element to characterise fault and 
imputability is not needed, with the consequence that legal entities can be at fault 
as much as natural persons352. Not surprisingly, objectivist authors tend to favour 
a doctrine of risk rather than fault as a foundation of tort law. One is answerable 
for the risk created ( risque cr&eacute;&eacute; ), or for the risk one benefits from ( risque pro fit )353.
</p>
<p>Objective tendencies have gained ground in positive law. In 1968, a provision was 
added to the Civil Code, making people causing damage while suffering from men-
tal disorders fully liable354, whether liability is based on fault or not355. Courts have 
followed that lead, with the Plenary Assembly of the Court of Cassation ruling, in 
1984, that young children deprived of discernment are liable for fault on the basis of 
art 1382, and also for damage caused by things under their custody under art 1384356.
</p>
<p>The advent of objective fault was wrongly described as the triumph of the ob-
jectivist approach357. Viney and Jourdain propose a more careful explanation358. The 
highest French Court wanted to extend the legislative work done as regards dam-
age caused by the mentally disordered to infants, for the sake of consistency. Both 
mentally disordered people and infants should be liable for their wrongful acts, 
regardless of lack of discernment. It is not certain, however, that such symmetry 
makes sense for practical purposes, and it comes as no surprise that the solution 
is severely criticised in doctrine. Viney rightly observes that it was a useless move, 
due to the impecuniosity of most children: it is much wiser to attach liability to 
their parents or caretakers359. If an action against children is allowed, it should be 
limited to the requirements of equity, taking into account the economic circum-

<p>stances of the parties, as in Germanic countries360. Generally speaking, parents 
take out liability insurance covering damage caused by children under their guard 
when they purchase homeowner insurance or insure leased property. Why then 
shift liability to the child, when the Civil Code already makes parents liable for 
damage caused by their children ?
</p>
<p>It may be tempting to conclude, like Muriel Fabre-Magnan, that the adoption 
of a concept of objective fault means the demise of the condition of imputabil-
ity, that moral fault is gone, and fault under French law amounts to wrongful-
ness and nothing more361. However, this would extend a legislative and jurispru-
dential movement well beyond its intended and practical consequences. Though 
not devoid of logic, this conclusion denies the primarily pragmatic character of 
French law and the common sense of the French, who remain deeply attached to 
the moral notion of fault.
</p>
<p>Imputability simply has a reduced scope, and tends to be presumed the mo-
ment wrongfulness is proved to exist. Fault has not shrunk to mean simply wrong-
fulness, except when it comes to protecting paramount rights such as property 
and personality rights, or in those few cases where faute objective is applied. Im-
putability remains a condition in the vast majority of cases decided on the basis of 
arts 1382 and 1383. Considered from a comparative perspective, French law is not 
at odds with other systems, as might appear at first sight. The French may say that 
fault includes wrongfulness and imputability ( though in a reduced form ), which 
is true from a French perspective. From an outside viewpoint, one may safely con-
clude that France has two sets of requirements for fault-based liability: wrongful-
ness ( illic&eacute;it&eacute; ) and fault ( imputabilit&eacute; ), the latter including intentional fault and 
negligence and being presumed in many cases.
</p>
<p>B. The indirect role of wrongfulness in no-fault liability
</p>
<p>No-fault liability gained much ground in French law in the wake of the Jand&rsquo;heur 
case362, confirming that liability for the act of a thing under one&rsquo;s custody is not 
based on the reversal of the burden of proving fault, exoneration being limited to 
proof of  force majeure.  It was extended by special legislation imposing strict li-
ability for damage where a motor vehicle is implicated363 or damage caused by a 
defective product364. This section will show that these developments did not make

<p>wrongfulness peripheral in French tort law. Even when drifting away from fault-
based liability ( the development of no-fault liability exerting a centrifugal force ), 
French tort law rarely favours pure strict liability or absolute liability, these only 
existing under special legislation365. When founding liability on art 1384 and claim-
ing that liability stems from the act of a thing under one&rsquo;s guard, French courts 
accept that liability may be reduced by the taking into account of the victim&rsquo;s fault 
( the consideration of the victim&rsquo;s fault exerting a centripetal force ). Apportion-
ing liability in such cases leads the courts to indirectly adopt a comparative neg-
ligence approach. This presentation will deviate from French traditional doctrine 
categorising liability for the act of a thing under one&rsquo;s custody as no-fault liability 
( responsabilit&eacute; sans faute ), showing how fault and wrongfulness are reintroduced 
in a subtle and indirect way.
</p>
<p>1. The return of fault under hidden comparative negligence
</p>
<p>Article 1384 deals with liability for others ( parents for their children, employers 
for employees, etc )366 and liability for damage caused by a thing ( eg, animals, col-
lapsing buildings )367. It starts with a paragraph that was meant to be introductory: 
&raquo; [ a ] person is liable not only for the damage he causes by his own act, but also 
for that which is caused by the acts of persons for whom he is responsible, or by 
things which are in his custody. &laquo; There is evidence that the drafters of the Civil 
Code never intended to give this sentence normative force, so much were they at-
tached to founding liability on fault  368. Yet, in 1896 ( Teffaine case )369, the Court of 
Cassation ruled that this paragraph contains an autonomous principle of liability 
for the act of a thing, creating an exception to art 1382 fault-based liability, as the 
party having custody of such thing could be liable based on some latent defect of 
the thing. In Teffaine, damage had been caused by the explosion of the defective 
engine of a tugboat. Attempts were later made to reduce the scope of the new doc-
trine to the &raquo; act of the thing &laquo; ( explosion of a boiler, defective brakes in a car ) from 
the &raquo; act of a man &laquo; ( damage caused by the driver of a car ). In the famous Jand&rsquo;heur 
case, a child had been run over by a lorry. Lower courts excluded the application 
of art 1384, as the damage was not caused by a defect in the vehicle but by the act 
of the man behind the wheel. The Court of Cassation disapproved, insisting that 
the article does not distinguish whether the thing causing the damage had or had

<p>not been the result of an act by man370. From that time on, art 1384 was applied to 
all accidents caused by motor vehicles, simply based on the fact that a thing ( the 
car ) had been in contact with the victim, causing damage. Obviously, this solution 
no longer applies to road accidents, which are now subjected to the special regime 
of the law of 5 July 1985. However, art 1384 remains applicable to all other things, 
whether or not brought about by an act by man.
</p>
<p>Once the act of the thing is established and the party having custody identi-
fied371, the latter is liable, unless such proves that the damage was produced by 
some outside cause that qualifies as force majeure372, meaning it must be unfore-
seeable and irresistible. This may be the act of a stranger or a fortuitous event, or 
an act of the victim373. Force majeure fully exonerates the party having custody. 
However, liability may also be reduced based on the fault of the victim, even when 
this is foreseeable and avoidable374. This means that liability may be apportioned, 
allegedly exclusively on the basis of the consideration of the victim&rsquo;s negligence. 
This applies to the fault of a lady accompanying a passenger and stepping off the 
train as it is already in motion and being injured by it375, or to the act of a person 
who, having been denied access to a public place, violently pushes the glass door, 
causing it to break, and is injured by the act of the door376. One cannot openly talk 
about comparative negligence in such cases, as courts must refrain from discuss-
ing the fault of the party having custody in order to avoid cassation. However, one 
may fairly suppose that lower judges may be tempted to compare the degree of 
negligence of both parties. Whether this happens or not, these cases show that 
fault plays at least an indirect role in allegedly no-fault liability. The fact was pat-
ent before the adoption of the law of 1985 on road traffic accidents, when liability 
was based on art 1384. Insurance companies called on to intervene or those subro-
gated in the victims&rsquo; place, used to litigate over the respective fault of each party in 
collision cases, causing liability to be apportioned in many cases377.
</p>
<p>This caused such an influx in litigation that, in the summer of 1982, the Sec-
ond Civil Panel of the Court of Cassation ruled that the victim&rsquo;s fault could no

<p>longer lead to partial exoneration, and was not to be taken into account unless 
unforeseeable and irresistible, in which case it caused full exoneration378. In this 
case, the two victims had crossed a four-lane thoroughfare at rush hour, without 
paying attention to oncoming traffic. Their presence on the street was found fore-
seeable, and the driver was found fully liable based on the custody of the vehicle. 
This case caused uproar and was severely criticised. It triggered the debate leading 
to the adoption of the law of 5 July 1985. Shortly after the adoption of the new law, 
the Court of Cassation retreated to its traditional jurisprudence, granting partial 
exoneration based on the victim&rsquo;s fault. This happened in a case where the victim, 
despite repeated warning, stood under a tree while the owner thereof was pruning 
branches with a chainsaw, and was injured by the fall of a branch379, a case offering 
an ideal scenario for comparative negligence.
</p>
<p>The Court of Cassation of Belgium takes a different approach. The very same 
art 1384 para 1 is only applied to damage caused by a defective thing. Proof of the 
defect, to be adduced by the victim, creates an absolute presumption of fault, 
which can only be defeated by the proof that damage was caused by an outside 
event380.
</p>
<p>2.  The return of wrongfulness under the passive but abnormal role 
of the thing
</p>
<p>Among the many debates regarding liability for the act of a thing, is the discussion 
as to whether the thing must have had an active role in causing damage. Some 
courts impose on the victim the burden of proof that the thing played an active 
role ( r&ocirc;le actif de la chose )381 whilst others seem to presume this active role and al-
low the defendant to plead the passive role ( r&ocirc;le passif de la chose ) as a defence382. 
The active role seems to be presumed when the thing is in movement or when it 
explodes383.
</p>
<p>When a thing is not in movement ( chose inerte ), it may nonetheless be held to 
have played an active role. Before the law of 1985, this was the case when a car was 
parked in an abnormal way, so that other divers may be surprised to find it where

<p>it was384. The party having the custody of a staircase is liable based on art 1384 if 
it is proven that the steps were slippery or the staircase poorly lit up385. The Court 
of Cassation tends to request the evidence of some abnormal character of the in-
ert thing that &raquo; caused &laquo; the damage. In a recent case386, a victim was injured as a 
consequence of stepping onto a ten centimetre high concrete curb separating the 
parking space from the pedestrian entrance to a shopping mall. As the curb was 
in good condition, painted in white and therefore visible to a normally careful per-
son, and given the fact that it was possible to reach the stores without walking on 
it, the curb had played no active role in the fall of the victim.
</p>
<p>These cases prove one thing: when the thing alleged to have caused the dam-
age is inert, it may only be held to have played some active role, triggering liability 
based on art 1384, when it is not properly maintained, signalled, painted, or posi-
tioned, thus rendering it abnormal. In other words, the party having custody of 
such a thing does not incur liability unless having done something wrong in con-
nection with it. Though matters are not described this way in French cases and 
in the literature, the victim must prove wrongfulness in order to be compensated 
when harm is the consequence of a fall on some inert thing.
</p>
<p>II.  The three levels of wrongfulness under French law
</p>
<p>A flexible approach to the notion of wrongfulness cannot but be approved when it 
comes to developing comparative perspectives387. Koziol proposes a three-level ap-
proach when it comes to looking at the incorrectness of conduct.
</p>
<p>The first level is a theory of wrongfulness of the result. Koziol describes it as aim-
ing at protecting some higher interests, &raquo; such as life, health, liberty and prop-
erty &laquo;388, and preventing damage to them. From a French perspective, this echoes 
the victim-oriented th&eacute;orie de la garantie, focusing on the idea that the victim&rsquo;s in-
terest must be protected and compensation is due, the legal-ethical element resid-
ing in the infringement of a higher interest389. In French law, this approach is con-
ducive of no-fault or strict liability, which seems to be favoured when it comes to

<p>protecting bodily integrity and property390. However, it is excluded when it comes 
to the compensation of non-pecuniary damage, where it is necessary to come back 
to more traditional tort doctrines. In such cases, the French may agree that &raquo; this 
wrongfulness of the result ( &hellip; ) is not in itself suitable to serve as a decisive liabil-
ity criterion under the law of tort &laquo;391, though said wrongfulness may support defen-
sive rights such as acting in self-defence or using preventive injunctions392. This 
should not, however, lead one to believe that strict liability is devoid of a legal-
ethical element, as the author seems to suggest393. Prioritizing the protection of 
human life on the highways is not a purely legal choice, it includes a moral judge-
ment. Human beings cannot survive and prosper without using public roads and 
streets, as pedestrians, users of public transport or motorists. Freedom of move-
ment is recognised as a human or fundamental right. With the advent of motor-
ised transportation, our contemporaries expose themselves to risks higher than 
those existing at the time of horse-drawn carts. As a response, jurisdictions like 
France, Israel or New Zealand adopted strict liability and socialised compensation 
schemes. Potential perpetrators operating in such a strict liability environment 
know the rules of the game and have to act with the utmost care to avoid exposing 
others to bodily injury and property damage, and exposing themselves to liability 
by the simple fact of collision with another vehicle or a pedestrian. All motorists 
are potential perpetrators, protecting others and protected by others. Non-mo-
torists are legally protected unless their inexcusable fault can be regarded as the 
exclusive cause of the accident394. There is a strong solidarity element there: you 
share the road, you share the risk.
</p>
<p>Are pedestrians more careful in an environment where the chances of getting 
compensation are contingent on fault-based liability claims ? Statistics by insur-
ance companies may suffice to prove that the shorter the life expectancy, the more 
careful people are. Younger people tend to be careless whatever the legal environ-
ment. They expose themselves as much as they expose others. At the other end of 
the spectrum, though statistically known to be more careful, elderly people are 
frail and have slower reactions, making them more exposed to accidents. There-
fore, French law affords additional protection to the young and the elderly, as well

<p>as to the disabled395. French doctrine calls them super-protected victims ( victimes 
superprivil&eacute;gi&eacute;es )396.
</p>
<p>The second level of incorrectness is described as &raquo; carelessness in the given 
situation &laquo; and is measured according to an objective standard397. This  theory of 
wrongfulness of the conduct matches the breach of a duty of care doctrine observed 
in common law jurisdictions, particularly in English law. Though the French Civil 
Code does not expressly require the existence of a duty of care, it is commonly 
admitted that fault means either the breach of a statutory duty or the infringe-
ment of more general duties, such as the duty to behave, in all circumstances, in 
a careful and diligent way ( devoir g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de prudence et de diligence )398, as dis-
cussed above. The violation of a pre-existing duty, or the infringement of an exist-
ing right, characterises the illicit element ( wrongfulness ), expressly requested in 
the Italian Civil Code399 and implicitly required in the French Civil Code. A major-
ity of authors accept that wrongfulness ( l&rsquo;illicite ) is required400, making French 
law wrongfulness-of-the-conduct driven whenever liability is fault-based. L&rsquo;illicite 
is the objective element, and l&rsquo;imputabilit&eacute; refers to culpa and constitutes the sub-
jective element401.
</p>
<p>The third level of incorrectness of the conduct looks at &raquo; whether the objec-
tively careless act can be counted against the specific perpetrator on the basis of 
subjective abilities and circumstances &laquo; 402. It refers to the subjective dimension of 
fault. It cannot be denied that this is a &raquo; weightier criterion for liability &laquo;, and it is 
certainly the case in many cases of fault-based liability that end up being resolved 
in criminal courts, the victim bringing the claim in damages in a forum basing 
judgment on very subjective circumstances. In all other cases, as explained earlier 
in this chapter, French courts tend to presume that the subjective element exists 
from the moment they are convinced that the actor&rsquo;s conduct was wrongful.
</p>
<p>395 Art 3: &raquo; Victims, apart from drivers of terrestrial motor vehicles, shall be compensated for the 
damage resulting from personal injuries suffered by them, and their own fault may not be 
pleaded against them, except where their inexcusable fault was the sole cause of the accident. 
Where the victims referred to in the preceding subparagraph are under the age of sixteen or 
over the age of seventy or where, irrespective of their age, they are holders of a certificate at-
testing a degree of permanent incapacity or invalidity of at least 80 %, they shall in all cases 
be compensated for the damage resulting from the personal injuries they have suffered. Nev-
ertheless, in the cases mentioned in the two preceding subparagraphs, the victim shall not be 
compensated by the person who caused the accident for the damage resulting from his per-
sonal injuries, where he intentionally brought about the damage suffered.&laquo;

<p>III. Protection against insignificant infringements
</p>
<p>Typically, people do not sue in the case of minimal damage, the cost and has-
sle of litigation exceeding the anticipated compensation. However, some people 
would sue regardless of the magnitude of the damage, making it clear that they 
are vindicating their right rather than looking for monetary compensation. This 
typically happens where the damage is caused by criminal action, the prosecu-
tion having no right to drop the charge when there is a civil law suit by the victim 
( plainte avec constitution de partie civile ). Many victims are looking for opportu-
nities to make impact statements and obtain public recognition that a wrong was 
suffered403. Where there is an infringement of a personality right, such as honour, 
privacy, or image, many a victim would be content with nominal damages, and the 
publication of a statement in the medium that infringed the right was published 
in404. Reparation is not exclusively a financial matter, especially when it comes to 
protecting extra-patrimonial rights.
</p>
<p>There is no de minimis rule in the French Civil Code. Justice must be done also 
for small claims. De minimis standards may exist in contractual practice, where 
they are customary. Very often they are contracted upon, like the 5 %-surface al-
lowance in sales of immovables, stipulated by professional sellers of apartments 
or houses to be built ( vente en l&rsquo;&eacute;tat futur d&rsquo;ach&egrave;vement ), or the 3 to 5 %-quantity 
allowance in sales of raw materials and commodities. In tort law, the rule remains 
full compensation ( r&eacute;paration int&eacute;grale ), which may lead to the award of nomi-
nal damages when a fundamental right is infringed ( the euro symbolique, or previ-
ously the franc symbolique ).
</p>
<p>The refusal of compensation or the denial of an injunction in the case of a 
minor nuisance ( trouble de voisinage ) is regarded by some as the application of a 
de minimis rule405. It actually reflects the fact that there is no wrongful nuisance 
in such a case, because the nuisance complained of is below the normal level of 
inconvenience that neighbours must tolerate when they live close to one another. 
The standard of nuisance is abnormality ( inconv&eacute;nients anormaux de voisinage ), 
which is however regarded as a question of fact by the French Court of Cassation, 
though this is obviously a legal question. As explained earlier406, the highest Court 
in France tends to enlarge the scope of what it considers an issue of fact whenever 
it wants to reduce the scope of its review407. Viney observes that that the Court of

</p>
<p>Cassation did not abdicate all review power on the matter, as it verifies that lower 
judges characterise the abnormality, sometimes interfering with the characteri-
sation408. Authors in the field write that it must be assessed  in  concreto,  taking 
into account the nature and standing of the location, the population density, the 
purely residential or mixed environment, etc409. Whilst the threshold of what may 
be tolerated ( le seuil de tol&eacute;rance ) must be based on careful factual analysis, this 
is ultimately a question of law, to be determined in accordance with a standard410. 
The moment one applies a standard, one adopts an objective perspective411. Does 
this mean that subjective perceptions are to be eliminated ? Some victims are more 
sensitive to noise than others. As a rule, courts refuse to take into account the vic-
tim&rsquo;s predisposition in order to reduce compensation412. This does not mean that 
they may not take such predisposition into account to increase the quantum of 
damages when convinced that the victim was more sensitive413. Take the case of a 
malicious perpetrator who, knowing that a neighbour is particularly sensitive to 
noise or suffers an allergy, intentionally aggravates the victim with noise or plant-
ing highly allergenic plants under the window. Compensation would probably be 
granted, though the nuisance may be significantly below the level of abnormality. 
Such a judgment, however, should rather be based on the general clause of art 1382 
or on abuse of right than on the doctrine of &raquo; trouble de voisinage &laquo;.
</p>
<p>Compensation of trivial damage is often denied by insurance companies. 
Standard insurance policies impose significant deductibles ( franchise ) to limit 
the number of claims. A waiver of a deductible is an expensive item, sometimes 
offered to favoured customers. The insured typically prefers to pay a reduced pre-
mium. The deductible can be compared to the &raquo; co-pay &laquo; system imposed on pa-
tients who may only get refunded for a limited proportion of their medical ex-
penses ( typically 70 % ), though many people purchase complementary insurance 
to benefit from 100 % coverage414.
</p>
<p>The existence of an insurance deductible, which makes sense from an eco-
nomic perspective, does not prevent the victim from suing for recovery of the un-
covered amount. In this respect, the &euro; 500 threshold imposed by the European 
Directive of 1985 for the compensation of damage caused by defective products is 
questionable. The French did not regard the imposition of a threshold as a condi-

<p>tion of harmonisation, and preferred to be more protective of victims415. Following 
an action brought by the Commission, the French Republic was regrettably forced 
by the European Court of Justice to impose the &euro; 500 threshold416.
</p>
<p>IV. Protection of pure economic interests
</p>
<p>According to Koziol, &raquo; [ w ]e talk of damage to pure economic interests when there 
are disadvantageous changes to assets sustained without any violation of so-called 
absolutely protected rights &ndash; ie in particular personality rights, in rem rights and 
intellectual property rights417 &laquo;. Such rights are to receive limited protection, &raquo; be-
cause they do not concern the infringement of already specified and legally rec-
ognised interests418 &laquo;, Koziol also adding that &raquo; the interests are not discernible to 
third parties and if there was farther reaching protection there would be a danger 
of boundless duties to compensate419. &laquo;
</p>
<p>French law does not know such restrictions and does not even have a concept 
of pure economic loss420. The Civil Code does not define reparable damage, and any 
identifiable damage may be repaired under French law, provided it is certain and di-
rect. It seems that the &raquo; horror pleni &laquo; of the incalculable number of victims421 should 
be mitigated by a proper application of causation requirements422. French law main-
tains the principle of full compensation ( r&eacute;paration int&eacute;grale ), while avoiding unwar-
ranted consequences by a careful use of other elements of liability. Suppose that at 
rush hour a car running out of gas is immobilised in a heavily frequented urban tun-
nel, causing a monstrous traffic jam. Thousands of people face delay: some may miss 
profitable business opportunities, may arrive late for an exam, and may miss flights 
or a last chance of validating a lottery ticket. Supposing one of them sued the neg-
ligent driver who forgot to tank-up before driving, courts would conclude that the 
damage is not the direct consequence of the defendant&rsquo;s negligence, or if admitting 
causation, that it simply caused a loss of a chance thus minimising compensation423, 
or may also decide that driving in a busy tunnel implies the assumption of a risk.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Likewise, claims by indirect victims complaining about loss of support due 
to the death of a loved one ( victime par ricochet ) are limited to those who suffer 
personally and directly, which includes close relatives and the deceased&rsquo;s closest 
friends but excludes business partners or creditors424. Generally speaking, causa-
tion appears to be the main stopper to unreasonable or excessive claims425.
</p>
<p>All this shows that, much as in common law or Germanic jurisdictions, sig-
nificant compensation of pure economic loss is mainly to be found in the contrac-
tual sphere, where it is contained by the legislative limits to be found in the Civil 
Code426. The French experience gives no signal that the principle of full compensa-
tion should be limited in order not to include pure economic loss except in contract 
cases, where in the absence of bad faith on the part of the obligor, compensation 
is limited to foreseeable damage427. Causation and certainty of damage do the trick.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the floodgate syndrome is absent from French literature. Such a 
syndrome develops in those jurisdictions where access to compensation is narrowly 
channelled and limited428. In the common law, access to damages was historically 
limited by causes of actions ( the writs ), later to be replaced by binding precedents. No 
writ, no action. No precedent, no remedy. Opening new remedies in new situations is 
of course possible but generates conservative hostility and the fear of unpredictable 
consequences. Since there is no general or conceptual boundary to the development 
of liability, anxiety can take its course, as the development of tort law is notionally 
fully open and expansible. In Germanic countries, there is a tradition of defining the 
protected interests in separate boxes, yet with a possibility of opening protection to 
some unlisted interest429. The moment a new interest pops up, the floodgate syn-
drome is activated. Under French law, the general clause of art 1382 gives the broad-
est framework possible, rather than digging narrow canals or drawing little boxes. 
Canals may need to be controlled by floodgates. A system as large as a sea or a vast 
lake is not generative of floodgate syndromes. This is why the French can live with-
out &raquo; the 10 commandments of liability for economic loss&laquo;430 though French judges 
and scholars would without doubt agree that they make sense. An analysis of French 
cases in the light of such valuable guidelines may prove that, in their judgments, 
French courts do not deviate from the common core of Western legal systems431.

<p>V. Liability for others
</p>
<p>Though the French Civil Code makes no provision that &raquo; [ a ]s a rule no one is re-
sponsible for unlawful acts of third parties in which he had no part &laquo;432, it is clear 
under French law that liability for others is limited to those cases for which the 
law makes provision.
</p>
<p>Article 1384 of the French Civil Code reads: &raquo; A person is liable not only for the 
damage he causes by his own act, but also for that which is caused by the acts of 
persons for whom he is responsible &laquo; ( para 1 ), also providing: &raquo; [ f ]athers and moth-
ers, in so far as they exercise parental authority, are solidarily liable for the dam-
age caused by their minor children who live with them &laquo; ( para 4 ), &raquo; [ m ]asters and 
employers, for the damage caused by their servants and employees in the func-
tions for which they have been employed &laquo; ( para 5 ), &raquo; [ t ]eachers and craftsmen, for 
the damage caused by their pupils and apprentices during the time when they are 
under their supervision &laquo; ( para 6 ), and para 7 exonerating parents or craftsmen 
when they &raquo; prove that they could not prevent the act that gives rise to that liabil-
ity &laquo;433 and para 8 requiring negligence to be proved in law suits against teachers. 
In a landmark case of 1991434, the Court of Cassation inferred from art 1384 para 1 
a general principle of liability for others, making a rehabilitation centre liable for 
the damage caused by a handicapped patient under its care, who had voluntarily 
started a fire that destroyed a forest.
</p>
<p>Regarding liability for auxiliaries, the scope of art 1384 para 5 is very general435. 
It cannot be disregarded in cases where liability may stem from a contractual obli-
gation in application of the non-cumul rule, since courts also cite the article when 
dealing with contractual matters436: French law recognises a general principle 
of contractual liability for the acts of auxiliaries, which encompasses the rule in 
art 1384 para 5437.

</p>
<p>That the liability of the principal must be based on the objective misconduct of 
the auxiliary438 is beyond doubt under French law: it is enough to prove that the 
auxiliary has, within the scope of his functions, acted in such a way that he would 
incur liability, had he acted on his own account439. The auxiliary pursues the prin-
cipal&rsquo;s interest and the auxiliary acts within the principal&rsquo;s sphere of responsi-
bility440. France no longer bases the principal&rsquo;s liability on a presumption of the 
latter&rsquo;s fault in the choice or the supervision of the auxiliary441. French scholars 
have named the ideas of risk ( Savatier ), guarantee of the victim&rsquo;s rights ( Starck, 
Larroumet ), legal substitution of the principal ( Mazeaud ), equity and social inter-
est ( Rodi&egrave;re ), or authority exerted over the auxiliary ( Julien ), as a possible founda-
tion442. Viney adds the relevance of the principal&rsquo;s solvency and insists that beyond 
the principal portrayed as an individual, the law targets the enterprise, perceived 
as an economic unit443, an idea that comes close to the concept of enterprise liabil-
ity, embraced by the European Group on Tort Law444.
</p>
<p>When the damage is caused by the auxiliary&rsquo;s fault, there is no need to sue the 
auxiliary alongside the principal, though the victim may tend to do so by way of 
civil action, when the auxiliary is prosecuted445. In the past, the principal&rsquo;s liability 
did not shield the auxiliary from legal action by the victim446. In the Rochas case447, 
the auxiliary was held to be immune in a recourse action by the principal when 
having acted within the scope of his mission, limiting the principal&rsquo;s recourse to 
cases of a personal fault by the auxiliary ( &raquo; faute personnelle &laquo;, outside the scope 
of his duties ). Things were pushed further with the Costedoat case448. Farmers had 
contracted with a company to spread herbicides by helicopter. The pilot, an em-
ployee of the company, did so on a windy day, causing the products to damage 
neighbouring plantations. Owners who suffered damage sued both the principal 
and the pilot, and all were found liable by the lower courts: the pilot had been 
negligent, since he should have refrained from spraying on a windy day. The Ple-
nary Assembly of the Court of Cassation firmly disagreed, ruling that when acting 
within the scope of his mission, the auxiliary is not liable to third parties. Viney

<p>79Part 6&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;elements&emsp;of&emsp;liability
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>acknowledges that it would have been possible to shield the auxiliary against the 
principal without sacrificing the victim&rsquo;s interest: the immunity towards victims 
was too extensive. The victim should have a cause of action against the auxiliary 
when the latter is at fault, even when acting within the scope of his functions. The 
scope of the Costedoat ruling was later reduced, at least in cases where the auxil-
iary&rsquo;s fault is also a criminal offense, the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cas-
sation allowing the victim to claim compensation against the auxiliary when the 
fault, though not intentional, is serious enough449.
</p>
<p>The draft reforms450 tend to restrict the overall use of the principle &raquo; respon-
deat superior &laquo;, and to refine the scope of liability for others, somehow meeting 
the concern that entrusting someone with a task does not necessarily lead to an 
increase in risk, but may rather reduce risk when a more competent person is en-
trusted with the task451. The Terr&eacute; draft452 defines the scope of liability for auxilia-
ries using modern language453. It introduces a dualistic approach, distinguishing 
whether or not principal and auxiliary are bound by a contract of employment, 
with them being renamed employer and employee when such a contract exists.
</p>
<p>Where a contract of employment exists, the employer is liable except if an 
abuse of function ( abus de fonction ) is proved on the part of the employee, namely 
when acting without authorisation for a purpose unconnected with the employ-
ment454. Under the same provision, the employee is liable for the consequences of 
his intentional fault, which does not mean that the employer will always be exon-
erated in such a case. The draft reforms propose the following solutions regarding 
immunity against victims. Both the Terr&eacute; draft455 and the Catala draft456 exclude 
the liability of the employee acting within the limits of his employment when the 
employee has committed no intentional fault. The Catala draft rightly adds an ex-
ception for cases where the victim cannot recover from the employer or from in-
surance457, a point left open in the Principles of European Tort Law458.
</p>
<p>In the absence of a contract of employment, the liability of the principal is 
based on a simple presumption of negligence, the auxiliary being liable for his

<p>own fault459. This meets at least in part the concern that the application of the &raquo; re-
spondeat superior &laquo; principle may not always be justified in such a case460.
</p>
<p>Likewise, the Terr&eacute; draft provides an interesting structural change that was 
also discussed by the European Group on Tort Law, though not implemented in 
the PETL. Liability for others is not dealt with as a head of liability like fault or li-
ability for the fact of things ( fait g&eacute;n&eacute;rateur ); it deals with the imputation of liabil-
ity for compensation, shifting the onus to others. The draft locks liability for oth-
ers to cases provided for by the law and to cases where there is a delict461. This is 
a big change regarding the liability of parents for the acts of their children, which 
had been stretched in scope beyond situations where a child was the author of a 
delict, with infants made liable for objective  fault etc. One wonders whether the 
draft does not go too far when limiting the liability of parents to the &raquo; act of the 
minor &laquo;, which seems to exclude liability for the act of things, animals, or build-
ings, which may be too restrictive462, a restriction not to be found in the Catala 
draft which otherwise makes similar provisions463. Regarding liability for auxilia-
ries, the shift in perspective limits the risk of imposing liability on the principal in 
situations where the conduct of the auxiliary is not wrongful464.
</p>
<p>The Catala draft makes special provisions allowing victims to sue entities reg-
ulating or organising the activities of independent workers, or entities controlling 
the activities of others, such as franchisors or parent companies465. As a rule, un-
der French law, there is no room for applying liability for others in the case of a 
service contract, as entrepreneurs act independently, in the absence of the super-
vision of their activities by the other party ( absence de rapport de pr&eacute;position )466. 
The same applies to mandates: as a rule, art 1384 para 5 does not apply to the rela-
tionship of principal and mandatary467. Exceptions are made, however, in special 
circumstances where the mandatary acts under the supervision of the principal468, 
which is of course the case where the mandatary is also an employee of the princi-
pal: one may for instance be concurrently an employee and a mandatary of a legal 
entity469. As a rule, though no particular text may be cited to that effect, legal en-

explains why French law does not pay much attention to distinguishing organs

<p>Part 7 Limitations of liability
</p>
<p>This chapter discusses a problem of &raquo; excessive liability &raquo; 474. The application of the 
Germanic equivalence theory ( &Auml;quivalenztheorie ) makes the damaging party an-
swerable not only for the most direct damage but also for the consequential dam-
age caused to the victim, which may be inequitable or unreasonable475. French law 
has received the equivalency theory ( &eacute;quivalence des conditions ) but mitigates 
its effects by combining it with the theory of adequacy ( causalit&eacute; ad&eacute;quate ), also 
received from Germanic doctrine, the two being recombined in pragmatic ways 
by French courts476. French doctrine did not feel the need to conceptualise a dis-
tinction between natural and legal causation, though authors are well aware that 
equivalence is more on the factual side and adequacy on the legal side477.
</p>
<p>The French view the chain of causation as a continuum478. As a rule, the ad-
dition of new acts will cause liability to be split, unless such new acts interrupt 
the causal chain. When the &raquo; novus actus &laquo; is less serious than the original fault, 
liability will be split479. When the subsequent act of the victim or of a third party 
is at least as serious as the act of the original perpetrator480, the causal link is in-
terrupted. This implies a value judgement. An example of the interruption of the 
causal link by the victim is where the victim of an incident caused by negligence 
runs at full speed to catch the tortfeasor and dies of a heart attack: the author of 
the accident is not liable for the death of the victim481. A recent case provides an 
example of interruption by a third party482. During a celebration that took place at 
a private home, the hostess had lit candles downstairs. She later went to bed with-
out giving advice regarding the burning candles, thereby acting negligently. One 
of the guests subsequently brought the burning candles upstairs where the party 
went on all night, one of the candles causing a deadly fire in the early morning. In 
the opinion of the lower court, the original negligence of the hostess was held to

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>have contributed to the final disaster, but the Court of Cassation considered that 
the fault of the third party in bringing the candles upstairs without making sure 
they would be extinguished in due course interrupted the causal chain. The origi-
nal fault was no longer the direct cause, and we must conclude, in full agreement 
with Koziol483, that the subsequent fault constituted adequate cause.
</p>
<p>That the theory of adequacy, originally understood as a theory of causation, 
might better be described as a theory of liability based on value judgement484, can-
not be doubted. This can be demonstrated positively by considering cases where, 
often based on considerations of proof, a given fault or act is regarded as the ade-
quate cause, and also negatively, in instances where liability is said to exist though 
no damage has technically been caused, beyond the mere infringement of a highly 
protected interest such as a personality right. Based on a value judgement, be-
cause such infringement cannot but be sanctioned, nominal damages must be 
awarded ( often in addition to preventive measures ) though no harm actually oc-
curred. The fact that the perpetrator acted intentionally can also play a strong 
role485.
</p>
<p>The weakness of adequacy as traditionally understood by Germanic scholars, 
leading to an all-or-nothing approach486, has not permeated French law, which tra-
ditionally admits gradations, though not always based on solid logical premises. 
The flexibility of the French approach of causation has been described in an ear-
lier chapter, featuring a great willingness to adopt proportional liability, using 
among other things the theory of the loss of a chance, which offers a convenient 
fiction487. Adequacy can indeed be used in a much better way: it is open to grada-
tions, depending on the foundations of the responsibility488, so as to produce a 
more logical and predictable answer. This may work perfectly in a logically or-
ganised system. However, this is not the case in respect of contemporary French 
law, which combines fault based, no-fault based, and strict liabilities in somewhat 
haphazard ways. The good news is that under the careful stewardship of the Court 
of Cassation, French courts usually offer reasonable, flexible solutions. French ju-
risprudence limits liability when serious alternate or concurrent causes contrib-
ute to the damage, and imposes rebuttable presumptions of causation, especially 
when highly protected interests, such as human life, are at stake489.
</p>
<p>The special problem of lawful alternative conduct deserves special attention: 
&raquo; the issue is whether a perpetrator who has acted wrongfully is liable for the dam-

<p>age caused even if  he would  have  caused  the  same  harm  otherwise  by  lawful  con-
duct  490. &laquo; Koziol takes the example of a driver overtaking a cyclist leaving too little 
space on the side and crashing into him, when the damage would have occurred 
even had he allowed enough space, as the cyclist was drunk and did not keep to 
his side491. Under French law, the special law makes the motorist strictly liable, 
even in the case of force majeure ( such as for instance a violent and unpredictable 
wind gust ) or the victim&rsquo;s fault, except in those rare cases where the victim&rsquo;s fault 
is both inexcusable and the sole cause of the accident492. Before the law of 1985 
came into force, liability would have been accorded to the motorist based on the 
custody of the thing causing the damage493, but the victim&rsquo;s fault would have been 
taken into account either to exonerate the motorist if characterised as force ma-
jeure ( ie the victim&rsquo;s fault was unforeseeable and the accident could not have been 
avoided; the same would apply in the case of the violent wind gust ), or to reduce 
liability if foreseeable and avoidable494. The solution would have been identical in 
much earlier days, when liability was fault-based495.
</p>
<p>Another example is that of a doctor operating on a patient without inform-
ing him of the risks, yet without committing medical malpractice. The doctor&rsquo;s 
defence that the patient would have consented to surgery even if informed of all 
risks does not stand under French law. The Court of Cassation reversed a recent 
judgment that rejected medical liability496: the Court should at the very least have 
considered the existence of non-pecuniary damage, generated by the unprepared-
ness of the patient, and the fact that the patient was deprived of the opportunity 
to make a free choice, ask for a second opinion, etc, in a matter where a strongly 
protected interest ( the right to self-determination over one&rsquo;s own body ) was at 
stake497. Commentators of this case insisted that in the opinion of the Court of 
Cassation, the violation of this behavioural rule had to be sanctioned, given the 
importance of the protected interests498: the explanation that the rule is not so 
much aimed at preventing damage but instead at deterring certain types of behav-

</p>
<p>iour makes sense499. Non-pecuniary damages in this case may appear like a form 
of punishment, satisfying the deterrence function. On the one hand, it would be 
wrong to shift the onus of further compensation to the doctor, ie all the damaging 
consequences attributable to the side effects of the surgical procedure, in order 
to increase deterrence. There is indeed lack of causation, as the harm would have 
occurred even if the patient had received full information500. On the other hand, it 
would be wrong not to sanction an obviously wrongful situation, and to leave non-
pecuniary damage unrepaired. The French solution offers a satisfactory mid-way 
solution and stands on logical grounds.
</p>
<p>Koziol  rightly draws a parallel with supervening causation ( force majeure 
cases )501. Though full exoneration takes place in cases of Civil Code based liability 
where force majeure is successfully pleaded, one may wish for some form of pun-
ishment of the wrongdoer with a view to deterrence. This may only happen where 
there is a criminal offense. Germanic views offer another interesting perspective, 
with the idea that the party who has acted in a manner that poses a specific dan-
ger such as the increase of a risk, and acts wrongfully, must bear the entire risk 
in respect of clarifying the situation502, which implies a reversal of the burden of 
proof regarding causation. This would amount to proving, at the wrongdoer&rsquo;s ex-
pense, that the increase of risk had no effect in the case at issue. This is a very sen-
sible view, especially in lawsuits against professionals when matters turn out to be 
quite technical, such as cases of medical malpractice.
</p>
<p>Koziol also writes that &raquo; [ w ]hen wrongful behaviour is chosen deliberately, the 
notion of deterrence has greater weight so that full liability of the damaging party 
is justified even when the violations of the behavioural rules are not so weighty &laquo;503. 
Though the intensity or seriousness of fault should not be taken into account 
when it comes to determining the existence of liability504, there is little doubt that 
lower court judges will be keener to identify or presume causation in such circum-
stances. In addition, the existence of intentional fault or gross negligence ( &raquo; faute 
lourde &laquo;, considered equivalent to intentional fault505 ) will weigh heavily against 
the defendant, who may be deprived of the benefit of a legislative cap on liabil-
ity506 or of an exemption or limitation clause507.

<p>Part 8 The compensation of the damage
</p>
<p>I. The myth of full compensation as a basic principle
</p>
<p>French law is strongly attached to full compensation of the damage. Though not 
formulated in the tort-related Civil Code provisions, full compensation of the 
damage is presented as a basic principle of French tort law ( principe de la r&eacute;para-
tion int&eacute;grale )508. Viney and Jourdain suggest the more accurate wording of equiva-
lency of damage and compensation ( &eacute;quivalence entre dommage et r&eacute;paration )509. 
French scholars present it as the leading guideline when it comes to assessing 
damages510. The Court of Cassation has repeatedly asserted that civil liability aims 
at re-establishing, as exactly as possible, the equilibrium broken by the damage, 
and at repositioning the victim in the situation that would have existed in the 
absence of the damaging act511. Though examples can be found where this turns 
out to be true, a closer look shows that this so-called principle is at best an aspi-
rational guideline, more often frustrated than accomplished and sometimes frus-
trating when accomplished.
</p>
<p>As will be shown, and as shocking as this may sound to many a reader, a 
deeper, invisible driving force of French law may well be the principle articulated 
by Koziol, in one of the most powerful and truthful pages of his book, to the effect 
that &raquo; the stronger the grounds for liability on the side of the damaging party, the 
more comprehensive the compensation512 &laquo;. The fact that this corresponds to the 
general opinion of people is not to be neglected: sociological studies have shown 
that over 70 % of people believe that the amount of compensation should be re-
lated to the magnitude of fault513.
</p>
<p>508 See discussion in no 1 / 107 ff above. Art 1149 Civil Code, &raquo; Damages due to the obligee are, in 
general, for the loss he suffered and the profit of which he was deprived&hellip; &laquo; though regulating 
contractual liability, is often cited in support of the principle.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>A. The so-called principle of full compensation
</p>
<p>In the search of arguments in favour of full compensation, leading authors cite 
examples proving that in reality full compensation is not provided, especially in 
cases of bodily injury. The mere fact that courts routinely resort to a percentage 
of incapacity is fully arbitrary and does not take into account the victim&rsquo;s per-
sonal circumstances. Viney and Jourdain praise a Parisian court judgment for de-
ciding that in order to compensate bodily injury inflicted upon a severely hand-
icapped victim, recourse to compensation proportional to invalidity was to be 
abandoned514. According to the court, compensation was to be adjusted to the 
real needs of the victim, in order to ensure the best survival conditions possible, 
taking into account the victim&rsquo;s personal circumstances. With respect, this is pre-
cisely what courts should do in every single case of personal injury if the principle 
of full compensation, as articulated by the Court of Cassation and doctrine, is to 
make sense. Why restrict it to the case of a severely handicapped person ?
</p>
<p>Another area where full compensation is at best mythical is the compensa-
tion of non-pecuniary damage where &raquo; it loses all significance &laquo; and &raquo; generates the 
worst difficulties &laquo;515. By its essence, such damage cannot be assessed; how then 
could it be fully or comprehensively compensated ? Comprehensive compensa-
tion can at most mean that every head of damage will be taken into account. It 
cannot mean full compensation. Leading authors recognise that full compensa-
tion may be way too severe on the damaging party in cases of slight negligence or 
no-fault based liability and where there is no insurance coverage516.
</p>
<p>The only cases where one might get close to full compensation are damage 
to property, where a replacement is available, and pure economic loss, at least in 
those cases where it can be assessed precisely. But even there it can prove to be 
objectionable, as exemplified in a famous case. In 1955, in a New York gallery, an 
art collector had bought a Van Gogh painting, Jardin &agrave; Auvert, at a price of French 
francs ( FRF ) 150,000. In 1981, the owner applied for an export license as he wanted 
to move the painting to Geneva. The license was denied, and he presented the 
painting at a French auction where it sold for FRF 55 million. He sued the French 
government, complaining that as a consequence of their classifying the painting 
as a national heritage, he had been deprived of the opportunity of selling it to a 
foreign purchaser, evaluating the loss at FRF 250 million. The French State was 
found liable and ordered to pay FRF 145 million in damages517. The judgment was

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>strongly criticised518: it is inequitable to shift a speculative loss onto French tax-
payers519. The Public Treasury was ultimately defeated, the Court of Cassation not-
ing that the lower court had duly evaluated the damage, comparing the sale price 
in France with the sale price of comparable items on the international art market 
at the time when the painting was classified520.
</p>
<p>This case may have been decided under a wrong doctrine and in the wrong 
court. It looks more like an unjustified enrichment claim, where the French Re-
public keeps the painting on its territory considering it a national heritage, thereby 
creating a possibility for its national museums to pre-empt it, on the occasion of 
the next sale, at a cost way below its international value ( enrichment side ), and the 
previous owner is deprived of a substantial share of the mercantile value as calcu-
lated on the global art market ( impoverishment side ). The case should have been 
adjudged by an administrative court, the State being sued for a loss caused in the 
exercise of government power. Looking at it as a tort causes discomfort, knowing 
that the plaintiff might have recovered 1 or 2 % of the awarded amount if suing for 
the loss of a child or of a spouse. Viney and Jourdain agree that pure pecuniary in-
terests should not take priority over health care costs and loss of earning capacity; 
they accept, criticising this judgment, that there may be a hierarchy of protected 
interests521. They refer to the concept of legitimate expectations, and express a 
preference for equitable or adequate compensation522.
</p>
<p>B. The many limits to full compensation
</p>
<p>Full compensation is seldom a reality. Money cannot properly compensate for the 
loss of a dear one or the loss of a limb, leaving the most serious losses under-com-
pensated. Money may compensate for the loss of earnings but does not replace 
the fulfilment some people may find in their job. Non-pecuniary losses affect hu-
man beings in their essence, and cannot be properly evaluated and compensated. 
Damage to property and economic losses are the only heads of damage that may 
be assessed with some reasonable certainty.
</p>
<p>In addition, there are other limits to full compensation that come into play 
with all kinds of harm, including damage to property and economic loss. Legisla-
tive caps to liability may be mentioned, though they primarily exist in the field of 
contractual obligations. One should not neglect the fact, however, that under the

<p>special regime of liability for road accidents523, higher protection is given to the 
person than to property. Full strict liability is only applicable to personal injury524, 
the victim&rsquo;s fault coming into play regarding damage to property525. Contributory 
responsibility of the victim must indeed be mentioned. It plays an important role 
not only when liability is based on fault but also in allegedly no-fault liability, 
such as liability for the act of a thing in one&rsquo;s custody526. In cases of liability for 
others, the employee bears no liability at all where &raquo; culpa levis &laquo; or &raquo; culpa levis-
sima &laquo; exist527.
</p>
<p>C. The hidden principle of apportionment
</p>
<p>Full compensation is a myth, or at most a convenient, though often misleading, 
judicial guideline. To infer from this observation that French courts follow a hid-
den principle that damages must be apportioned based on the seriousness of 
the damaging activity may be too much of a stretch. Koziol&rsquo;s proposal that &raquo; the 
stronger the grounds for liability on the side of the damaging party, the more com-
prehensive the compensation &laquo;528 will be floated as a hypothesis, to be verified with 
a more extensive study of French jurisprudence. A number of factors have been 
revealed in the preceding pages, which should receive more scrutiny from French 
and comparative law scholars.
</p>
<p>The first factor is that the propensity to compensate non-pecuniary damage 
is much higher in the case of an intentional wrong529. It is much higher too when 
the right infringed is a fundamental right, as observed in the context of personal-
ity rights530.
</p>
<p>The second factor is that in all situations where the victim&rsquo;s fault is taken into 
account, judges proceed nolens volens to a comparative-negligence analysis and 
are likely to determine the case not on purely natural causation factors but based 
on the respective gravity of the alleged faults. This applies not only to fault-based 
liability but also to no-fault based liability, such as cases determined on the basis 
of art 1384 para 1531.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>The third factor, the interplay of equivalency and adequacy regarding the 
judgment on causation, injecting an intrinsically legal dimension that inter-
weaves natural causation and wrongfulness, is highly conducive of value-based 
judgement, leading judges to accept causation when targeting odious conduct or 
presume causation when a highly protected interest is at stake532.
</p>
<p>The fourth factor, apportionment of liability, is the rule in cases of uncertainty 
of causation. The characterisation of the injury as loss of a chance, a head of dam-
age to be fully compensated, is pure fiction, hiding the fact that exception is made 
to the so-called principle of full compensation. In reality, the victim receives par-
tial compensation533.
</p>
<p>II. Types of compensation
</p>
<p>Unlike the Germanic systems534, French law has no principle of the primacy of res-
toration in kind ( r&eacute;paration en nature )535. This does not mean that it is ignored. 
Many cases show that French courts favour restitution in the case of unlawfully 
detained property, removal or destruction, and restoration of immovables to their 
original condition536. The primacy of restoration in kind is to be welcomed if one 
accepts that it may be discarded in cases where it appears inappropriate because 
of cost or inconvenience537. As noted above, French judges are encouraged to take 
preventive measures by way of interim orders whenever it is possible to bring a 
damaging activity to an end538.
</p>
<p>As to the assessment of damages, it may be based on a concrete assessment of 
the loss or based on objective criteria, such as in the case of bodily injury539. Judges 
have the option of awarding a lump sum or periodic payments540.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>III. Reduction of the duty to compensate
</p>
<p>A few legal systems allow the judge to reduce the amount of compensation in 
some exceptional cases, particularly when full compensation would create an un-
bearable burden on the liable party541. Such provisions are to be found in Swit-
zerland542 and the Netherlands543. The European Group on Tort Law has devised 
a reduction clause: &raquo; In an exceptional case, if in light of the financial situation of 
the parties full compensation would be an oppressive burden to the defendant, 
damages may be reduced. In deciding whether to do so, the basis of liability ( Ar-
ticle 1 : 101 ), the scope of protection of the interest ( Article 2 : 102 ) and the magni-
tude of the damage have to be taken into account in particular. &laquo;544
</p>
<p>Whilst such a reduction obviously contradicts the so-called principle of full 
compensation, it echoes the underlying principle of apportionment identified in 
the previous paragraph.  Viney and  Jourdain  recognise that in the event of unin-
sured damage that occurred having been barely foreseeable, full compensation 
may be an excessive burden, when the damaging conduct is not blameworthy and 
the damage very costly545. The fact that French legislation is not conducive of ju-
dicial discretion in this respect546 does not prevent courts from making an equita-
ble judgment. Full compensation may be oppressive in a jurisdiction like France 
where only merchants may be protected by bankruptcy proceedings547.
</p>
<p>Also, as noted in the PETL Commentary, &raquo; The reduction clause also makes 
sense in those systems where the plaintiff&rsquo;s purpose in suing the tortfeasor is to 
make sure that a criminal prosecution will be taken against him, the victim add-
ing its civil action in damages to the prosecution. In some jurisdictions, the pros-
ecutor is then bound to prosecute and may not decide to drop the charge. The pur-
pose of the civil action may be the official recognition of an infringement rather 
than full compensation, which may be an oppressive burden to the defendant in 
some cases. &laquo;548 This clearly applies to France.

<p>Part 9 Prescription of compensation claims
</p>
<p>In France, prescription was reformed by a law of 17 June 2008 ( loi portant r&eacute;forme 
de la prescription en mati&egrave;re civile )549 rewriting entirely two titles of Book III of 
the French Civil Code: Title XX ( Of Extinctive Prescription ) and Title XXI ( Of Pos-
session and Acquisitive Prescription ). The new law is partly based on the Catala 
draft reform of the law of obligations and prescription. This may be regarded as 
good news wherever such departure leads to improved convergence with other 
European systems. To some extent, the new law brings some simplification to this 
long neglected and complicated area of the law.
</p>
<p>The very nature of extinctive prescription remains controversial, as was the case 
in the past. Art 2219 gives a definition: &raquo; Extinctive prescription is a means of extinc-
tion of a right resulting from the inaction of its holder during a certain lapse of 
time. &laquo; Such language is imprecise and confusing, since the definition does not in-
dicate whether it is the substantive right that is extinguished or the procedural right 
to sue. This is a consequence of French formalism rather than pedagogy 550. The 
new law continues to juxtapose extinctive prescription ( extinction of a right ) with 
acquisitive prescription, defined in art 2258 as a &raquo; means of acquiring property or a 
right by the effect of possession. &laquo; The juxtaposition between &raquo; extinction of a right &laquo; 
and &raquo; acquisition of a right &laquo;, makes for an elegant binary distinction, a symmetrical 
&raquo; jardin &agrave; la fran&ccedil;aise &laquo;, a format cherished by French jurists. Careful analysis indi-
cates that extinctive prescription is a defence: according to art 2247, the judge may 
not raise prescription on his own motion. It bars a right to performance or to dam-
ages, but does not extinguish the obligation. In addition, no restitution may be or-
dered in the case of payment of a prescribed debt, such payment transforming what 
had become a natural obligation into a civil obligation551. This is a clear indication 
that there is no extinction of the substantive right but simply a defence, and that 
French law &raquo; is in line with what is widely recognised internationally &laquo;552.
</p>
<p>Major changes have been made to prescription periods and the way they are 
calculated. The main purpose of the reform is to favour the convergence of legal

<p>systems and bring some needed simplification. Art 2262, which used to state that 
&raquo; All actions, real as well as personal, are prescribed by thirty years &laquo;, has been ab-
rogated. The very lengthy thirty-year period is no longer the default rule553. Ac-
cording to the new art 2224, &raquo; personal actions or those pertaining to movables 
are barred five years from the day the holder of a right knew or ought to have 
known the facts permitting to exert it. &laquo; The Civil Code presents this rule as the 
default rule. The thirty-year rule is now limited to real actions pertaining to im-
movables554. The default five-year rule applies to all actions that had special rules 
in the past, with periods shorter than thirty years.
</p>
<p>One should not dream of an oversimplified world, however. Exceptions exist, 
some having an impact on tort claims. A thirty-year period applies to damage to 
the environment, starting from the event generating the damage555. A twenty-year 
period applies to damage caused by torture or acts of barbarism, or sexual vio-
lence or the assault of minors556. A ten-year period applies to actions in compensa-
tion of bodily injury557.
</p>
<p>All distinctions between tort and contract have been abandoned. The law uni-
fies the prescription of actions based on contractual and extra-contractual liabil-
ity. The Catala draft indeed moves towards a unification of the regimes of contrac-
tual and extra-contractual liability. Regarding prescription, the basic distinction 
now is between bodily injury and other heads of damage.
</p>
<p>Regarding bodily injury, the ten-year prescription period runs from the time of 
consolidation of the initial or aggravated damage. Consolidation means the stabili-
sation of bodily injury, or the state of the victim once medical care comes to an end: 
this is the moment where one moves from sometimes extensive temporary incapac-
ity to usually and hopefully limited permanent incapacity, in the event that the vic-
tim is permanently incapacitated at all558. The same test applies to cases where the 
prescription period is extended to twenty years, following torture or acts of barba-
rism, or sexual violence or the assault of minors559. These rules are even more pro-
tective than those existing in Germanic countries, since those make reference to the

<p>date on which the right could first have been exercised560, or require knowledge of an 
existing claim561, or knowledge of the damage and identity of the damaging party562.
</p>
<p>In the case of harm other than bodily injury and environmental damage, the 
five-year default prescription period applies563. The five years run from the time 
the victim knew or ought to have known the facts giving rise to the claim. The 
Catala draft was more victim-friendly, making the test purely subjective since it re-
quested actual knowledge of the facts564. The addition of constructive knowledge 
is welcome. It brings French law into line with German law565 and also the Unidroit 
Principles of International Commercial Contracts566. The solution comes close to 
the Principles of European Contract Law, and the test of reasonable discovera-
bility of the damage567. The subjective test is complemented by an objective one. 
Art 2232 imposes a &raquo; long-stop &laquo; peremptive period ( d&eacute;lai butoir ), making it impos-
sible to move the starting point of prescription, or to suspend or interrupt pre-
scription beyond twenty years counting from the moment the right starts to exist. 
This novelty568, proposed in the Catala draft569, is justified by the &raquo; slippery &laquo; point 
of departure of prescription570. It is another element of convergence of French law 
with German law and other European legal systems. The &raquo; long-stop &laquo; rule does not 
apply to cases of bodily injury or to the other cases listed in art 2232.
</p>
<p>Prescription does not run or is suspended in the case of &raquo; impossibility to act 
following an impediment resulting from the law, the convention, or force ma-
jeure &laquo;571. This is new in the Code. French courts used to apply the contra non va-

<p>I. Basic ideas
</p>
<p>Norwegian tort law rests upon the basic principle of  casum  sentit  dominus,  al-
though this principle is seldom cited in literature within the field1. Most attention 
focuses on the various bases of liability even though in reality the basic view is that 
damage lies where it falls. Historically speaking, the reasons for attributing dam-
age to persons other than the victim have mostly been tied to ideas of corrective, 
restorative and retributive justice. In the pragmatic version of the post-World War 
doctrine of Norwegian tort law, the justification for such responsibility is a claim 
for reparation of the damage, hence thoughts on &raquo; the purpose of reparation &laquo; have 
come to the fore in textbooks and doctoral theses on tort law2. This is a Norwegian 
version of corrective justice, which actually comprises two thoughts: firstly, it is 
important that the victim&rsquo;s damage is remedied or the injury compensated in full. 
Secondly, it is fair that the party who caused the damage ( in a manner that consti-
tutes a legal basis for liability ) should pay compensation. The tendency to high-
light these two thoughts has been developed by theorists apparently uninformed 
about the international discussions on corrective justice. Modern theorists have,

<p>however, imported theoretical insights from international discussions3. In recent 
years, Scandinavian scholars have turned their attention to the ideas of corrective 
justice developed by theorists like Weinrib and Coleman, a debate emerging from 
and building upon the early works of Aristotle4.
</p>
<p>However, in modern times the idea of distributive justice plays a very impor-
tant role in the development of tort law systems, especially regarding personal in-
juries. In personal injury cases, the issue of compensation for damage is seen as 
a comprehensive complex of rules. Rules of tort law make up the foundation, but 
to a large degree they overlap with rules of insurance schemes and a lengthy so-
cial security Act, which provides for many benefits that cover the losses stemming 
from the damage sustained. This is a feature of Scandinavian welfarism, hence 
there are similar compensation schemes in Denmark and Sweden. Distributive 
justice solutions have broad political support. If one looks closer at the prepara-
tory works for the constitutive reasoning behind this system, it seems clear that 
the idea that the victim should receive full compensation is very important.
</p>
<p>The system also has mechanisms for preventing over-compensation of the vic-
tim. The prevailing view is that the victim should be compensated in full but that 
in general he or she should not be more than fully compensated. A clear provision 
reads that benefits provided by the public should be deducted from the damages 
to be paid by the tortfeasor5. The solution that the social security benefits reduce 
the claim against the tortfeasor must be regarded as a profound principle within 
Norwegian law.
</p>
<p>The principle is paired with the fact that the social security institution 
( &raquo; Rikstrygdeverket &laquo; ) does not have a recourse claim against the tortfeasor. The 
right of recourse for the social security institution was abolished in 19706, except 
in the case of intention7. The abolition was an attempt to stop a development to-
wards too low personal injury awards that did not actually cover the loss. When 
social security paid the greater part of the actual economic loss of the victim with-
out having recourse to the tortfeasor, it became possible for the tortfeasor to han-
dle the burden of paying compensation. The system also avoids some transaction

<p>costs connected to recourse claims. A point that may be overlooked is that the 
system actually collects insurance premiums from every citizen, the potential vic-
tims. The economic effect resembles mandatory liability insurance for citizens. 
One may also question whether it is good that the greater part of the loss is not 
channelled to the real tortfeasors as a cost of the activities that actually produce 
the personal injuries. Such a system contradicts the main principles of law and 
economics, such as the idea that the loss should be borne by those that are able 
to reduce the risk of injuries.
</p>
<p>The idea of reducing the bill for tortfeasors is also evident in situations where 
a small commune provides for the nursing and care of a citizen seriously injured 
in traffic at great cost. The commune will not have a recourse claim against the 
traffic insurer in such a situation8. Thus, the public services in reality cover a great 
part of the victim&rsquo;s expenses related to the damage, reducing the bill for the tort-
feasor and the third party insurer. The principle also applies generally to health 
services provided by public hospitals &ndash; in reality such services cover part of the 
damage9, but still do not ground a recourse action from the state against the tort-
feasor. In fact, one might say that, via payment to the social security system, citi-
zens establish a sort of liability insurance in favour of the tortfeasor. The costs of 
the social security payment are financed by payments of certain taxes by employ-
ers ( &raquo; arbeidsgiveravgift &laquo;, Folketrygdeloven [ ftrl. ] &sect; 23&ndash;2 ) and every member of the 
system calculated as a percentage of their income ( &raquo; trygdeavgift &laquo;, ftrl. &sect; 23&ndash;3 )10. 
On top of this, the state may pay a contribution to the social security fund ( &raquo; stat-
stilskott &laquo;, ftrl. &sect; 23&ndash;10.)
</p>
<p>The system is well embedded in preparatory works, in the statutory provi-
sions and in court practice. A symptomatic formulation of the legal position is 
that tort law compensation is &raquo; a supplement &laquo; to the benefits and services pro-
vided by the social security system and the national health service. The &raquo; principle 
of supplement &laquo; is repeatedly applied in cases regarding the assessment of dam-
ages for personal injuries11. The reflections in Basic Questions I12 concerning the 
interplay between social security law and tortfeasors are thus a little different in 
respect of Norwegian law because of the lack of a recourse action available to the 
social security institutions.
</p>
<p>The idea of the public providing for a &raquo; net &laquo; of economic compensation secur-
ing the citizen&rsquo;s basic standard of living is really a prioritized political goal under

<p>whereas employees for the time being must pay 7.8 % of their salaries. For business income the 
percentage is 11.

<p>Norwegian law. Many insurance schemes are mandatory and secure the victim 
fully in the event of accidents. This applies to traffic insurance ( full compensa-
tion ) and the compensation for injuries to patients scheme ( full compensation by 
public funds ), and partially for the workmen&rsquo;s compensation scheme ( full com-
pensation for loss of annual income lower than 10 G ( approx &euro; 107,500 )13. Traffic 
insurance is a hybrid of liability and first party insurance, whereas the compensa-
tion for patients is a first party insurance paid via the ordinary tax bill. The work-
men&rsquo;s compensation insurance is paid by employers and is therefore a type of li-
ability insurance.
</p>
<p>An important element of public policy has been to provide systems that guar-
antee that the victim receives compensation within a short period after the damage 
is sustained. This is, for example, one purpose behind the design of the worker&rsquo;s 
compensation scheme14. The same is true for the special compensation scheme 
for patient injuries15. In order to ensure that the costs are allocated to the right 
collectives of insured persons, there are certain provisions prescribing a channel-
ling of funds from mandatory personal injury insurance schemes to the social se-
curity system. Thus, according to the law, the holder of a traffic insurance policy 
must pay a certain fee to the social security system ( see ftrl. &sect; 23&ndash;7 first section ). 
The fee covers the costs of the social security system that arise from personal in-
juries caused by traffic accidents ( see ftrl. &sect; 23&ndash;7 second section )16. Since 2004 the 
fee has been paid through the annual tax to the state for automobile owners. The 
state pays a corresponding amount to the social security fund17. A similar system 
has been established for the relationship between the workmen&rsquo;s compensation 
insurance and the social security system: the insurance companies that provide 
insurance covering accidents at work must pay a refund to the social security sys-
tem that is meant to cover the expenses of the social security system stemming 
from accidents at work ( see ftrl. &sect; 23&ndash;8 )18. The effect is that employers have to pay 
higher premiums in order to finance the duty to refund the amount to the social 
</p>
<p>13 &raquo; G &laquo; means &raquo; folketrygdens grunnbel&oslash;p &laquo;. One G is currently NOK 88, 370 ( approx &euro; 10,750 ). G is 
the &raquo; basic amount &laquo; in the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme. It is fixed by the state once 
a year in order to adjust National Insurance benefits for inflation.

cided by the government every year.

</p>
<p>surers has traditionally been 120 % of the compensation payments from the insurer to the in-
jured employee. See Kj&oslash;nstad, Folketrygdloven 965 f. One must at this point bear in mind that 
the social security system covers the greater part of the loss of income, whereas the workmen&rsquo;s 
compensation scheme only pays a supplementing sum.

<p>security fund. In this way the real cost of the employer&rsquo;s business is channelled to 
some extent to himself &ndash; as the individual who makes a profit from the work of his 
employees. A difference between the traffic liability scheme and the injury at work 
scheme is thus that the former assigns the duty to refund the social security fund 
to the insured automobile owner ( through the tax bill ) whereas the latter assigns 
the refund duty to the insurance companies.
</p>
<p>The principle of supplement paired with a relatively high general level of pub-
lic services generates a certain allocation of loss that is important to grasp: a con-
siderable share of the actual damage and loss stemming from tortious behaviour 
is in reality distributed among all members of society via the tax bill. The fact that 
the ordinary citizen puts up with a high level of taxation must be explained by the 
above-mentioned solidarity and welfarism of the modern version of social democ-
racy.
</p>
<p>These ideas also affect the situation of insurers. A first party insurer must 
pay compensation according to the insurance contract and does not have a re-
course claim against the tortfeasor unless the latter acted with intent or gross neg-
ligence19. Depending on the insurance contract, the victim may receive compensa-
tion from both the first party insurer and the tortfeasor. The Act has a special rule 
to reduce the award if there is first party insurance involved. The market-domi-
nating insurance companies have, however, ceased to claim such reductions, pre-
sumably because they want the buyers of first party insurance to feel that their in-
vestment is worthwhile. The legal basis for reducing the award therefore &raquo; sleeps &laquo; 
except for cases where the state is the tortfeasor, typically in medical malprac-
tice cases where Norsk Pasientskadeerstatning pays the damages on behalf of the 
state. A situation where only the state takes the benefit of a rule at the cost of a 
victim may have some disadvantages. The committee who drew up the new draft 
on personal injury awards has suggested abolishing the above-mentioned rule of 
reduction20.
</p>
<p>The above-described salient features of the Norwegian compensation system 
are mostly relevant for personal injuries. Other types of damage are not affected 
in the same way by the special Scandinavian approach and ideas of welfarism. 
Still, there are also rules for channelling the loss sustained from damage to things. 
Thus, damage to things caused by simple negligence within the private sphere will 
be covered by the victim&rsquo;s first party insurance provided that he has a policy. If this 
is the case, the victim is not allowed &ndash; this being prohibited by the law &ndash; to claim 
against the tortfeasor directly. And, accordingly, the first party insurer does not 
have a recourse claim against the tortfeasor. This follows directly from provisions

<p>in the Act on Compensation for Damage21. In this way, the damage to things that 
occurs in the private sphere of citizens is mainly covered by first party insurance. 
However, whenever damage is caused in the course of professional business, the 
provisions channel the loss to the liability insurers, also in cases where the dam-
age is caused by simple negligence or in cases of strict liability22.
</p>
<p>II.  The Norwegian version of pragmatism within 
tort law
</p>
<p>A. The sources of law and the application
</p>
<p>Tort law in Scandinavia has to a large extent been based on broad principles in-
tended to be applied in all areas of life. At the same time, only parts of the compre-
hensive set of rules are codified in formal statutory provisions. Crudely explained, 
general rules on culpa, strict liability, causation and the concept of damage are 
not codified, but exist only as general principles based on court practice and long 
respected customs. The rule of employers&rsquo; liability, liability for animals and chil-
dren and a set of provisions regarding personal injuries, recourse actions, contri-
bution and reduction are codified. As such, the lawmaker &ndash; with open eyes &ndash; has 
left great scope for development of the law to the courts. A court decision from the 
Supreme Court is binding for the lower courts and will accordingly most often be 
followed as far as the interpretation of the case reaches. Many important areas in 
tort law are governed by Supreme Court practice23.
</p>
<p>As long as tort law traditionally has consisted of rather few clear rules, the 
weighing up of concrete, individual interests in the light of broad principles has 
been a salient feature of the Norwegian tort law reasoning. Thus, Norwegian theo-
rists have for a long time recognised that the law of torts must be perceived differ-
ently than, for example, property law or contract law. The fact that the very core 
criteria of liability are formulated broadly speaks for a pragmatic approach to Acts, 
cases and other positive formulations of legal rules. This is necessary in order to 
apply the broad principles to the concrete and individual cases. As mentioned, the 
themes of tort law are kept general so that they can fit every area of life. A good 
example is the culpa rule, which is designed so that it can provide guidance in all 
kinds of cases, whether the case concerns highly professional technical skills or 
</p>
<p>21 This system is codified in skl. &sect;&sect; 4&ndash;2 and 4&ndash;3.
22 This follows from skl. &sect; 4&ndash;2 no 1 b ).
23 See eg the important case law on strict liability for dangerous activities, Rt. 1939, 766; Rt. 1948, 
</p>
<p>719 and Rt. 1983, 1052.

<p>more simple facts of everyday life, such as a teacher taking sufficient care of pupils 
while they perform gymnastics24. The generality of the norms in itself produces 
a need for discretion and pragmatic approaches based on the specific, individual 
facts of the case in question. As aired by Norwegian scholars, tort law is &raquo; the law 
of unexpected events &laquo;, hence one cannot always make clear rules beforehand25. To 
a certain extent the endeavours behind tort law reasoning require rational com-
binations of broad principles, similar cases and special considerations based on 
the merits of the case. In the Norwegian, rather pragmatic, tradition of legal rea-
soning and legal method, there are quite good possibilities for such adaptations. 
Especial mention is deserved for the tradition of allocating weight to the &raquo; real con-
siderations &laquo; of the case, an approach that resembles the idea of taking regard of 
the nature of the case ( &raquo; Die Natur der Sache &laquo; ).
</p>
<p>This methodological approach is paired with the mentioned governmental 
tradition of not codifying the most important rules. Neither the culpa rule nor the 
rule of strict liability is codified and therefore they are based on a set of considera-
tions and principles that must be converted into operative arguments in the con-
crete case at hand. These sets of considerations and principles have emerged from 
case law. At the same time, the strategy of the lawmaker is, and has been, that 
the development of existing principles is a task for the courts. Roughly estimated, 
only half of the material rules are expressed in statutory law. Accordingly, court 
practice plays a very important role in the development of tort law rules. A great 
number of decisions of the Supreme Court delimit liability and the assessment of 
damages. These cases provide the benchmarks for legal reasoning and are highly 
respected by lower courts and great attention is always paid when new variations 
of legal problems reach the Supreme Court. These factors generate an approach 
to legal reasoning within tort law that has much in common with the ideas of a 
flexible system, a point which is occasionally made by theorists26.
</p>
<p>B. A comprehensive methodological approach
</p>
<p>The overall picture is complex, but still possible to comprehend as a coherent sys-
tem. One must bear in mind that the Norwegian private law enactment, as men-
tioned above, has for a long time followed an ideology ( or policy ) of covering only 
parts of the law. At the same time, the courts are well aware of this and therefore

<p>apt to construct and develop general private law principles to solve cases. In this 
way a loose, but functional system is established. Without a doubt there are many 
gaps between positive rules that a jurist has to fill as best he or she can. The le-
gal method provides him or her with tools and devices for such an endeavour, 
for example, the above-mentioned &raquo; real considerations &laquo;27. A pragmatic version of 
Dworkin&rsquo;s constructive interpretation may be a way of explaining the approach28. 
The Norwegian approach may, in the terms of van Dam, probably be placed some-
where between the German systemised law and the English case-oriented and 
more pragmatic law29.
</p>
<p>Against this background the jurist will have a good sense of comprehensive-
ness looking at the system. When approaching a case, he or she may therefore be 
able to decide how the function should work best in the individual case. He will be 
aware that the main purpose of tort law is to compensate the victim, primarily eco-
nomically, whereas other private law institutes must be applied in order to achieve 
a disgorgement of profit. In principle, one might say that the Norwegian system 
to a large extent features possibilities for reaching a proportionality between the 
prerequisite of a legal rule and the effect of the rule. Hence, if there is wrongful-
ness, but not fault, on the part of A, he may be compelled to disgorge instead of 
make compensation.
</p>
<p>C. The all-or-nothing approach and its exemptions
</p>
<p>The all-or-nothing approach is to some extent embedded in the system as one of 
few firm points to heed when making a decision. An important reason for the all-
or-nothing approach is the development of the doctrine of causation. This doc-
trine builds upon the theories of John Stuart Mill   30. The influential writer of the 
early 20 th century, Fredrik Stang, transformed Mill &rsquo;s theories of causation into tort 
law principles of Norwegian law. In particular the theory of equivalence has gained 
importance: a necessary cause, even if it is only a small part of the causal factors, 
is a cause of the whole damage &ndash; and the tortfeasor is liable for all the loss31. Once 
the threshold of being a necessary cause is passed, the tortfeasor behind the cause 
is liable in full, though sometimes in solidarity with his fellow tortfeasor. As long 
as the causation rules are dominated by this view, there are constraints on the pos-
sibilities of contradicting solutions. The approach is very dominant in respect of

for radical solutions such as proportional liability32.
</p>
<p>The principle of all-or-nothing is, however, attacked by mechanisms that pro-
vide for a reduction of the claim so that the claimant must bear some of the loss 
himself. The rule of comparative fault and reduction of the loss on the basis of the 
victim&rsquo;s contribution to the damage is one example ( Skadeserstatninsloven [ skl. ] 
&sect; 5&ndash;1 ). The reduction clause ( skl. &sect; 5&ndash;2 ) is also important in this respect ( see the 
elaboration of this rule in no 2 / 145 ff  below). It should be noted that the reduction 
clause is a provision prescribing a certain room for discretion. Such room does 
not exist in the uncodified areas of tort law. Hence, the all-or-nothing principle is 
often respected and considered decisive.

<p>Part 2  The law of damages within the system  
of protected rights
</p>
<p>I. Introduction
</p>
<p>The idea of protected rights is not very explicit in Norwegian law. On a theoretical 
level, however, there are ideas about personal integrity and ownership of things 
and values. One pictures a sphere of interests that the individual possesses by 
virtue of his being a member of society and the legal order. If someone interferes 
with this sphere, without a legal basis to do so, compensation may be the sanc-
tion. The mere interference is, however, not enough in itself. The general system 
applies: one has to establish pecuniary loss or alternatively a legal basis for com-
pensation for non-pecuniary loss.
</p>
<p>As regards personal injuries, compensation systems other than tort are in fact 
more important means for protecting the victim&rsquo;s basic needs. Various compensa-
tion systems, such as insurance agreements or social security benefits, are politi-
cally desired solutions for securing the victim. Within the social democratic way 
of thinking, there is clear solidarity between members of the community deeply 
embedded in the political culture. Such solidarity may very well &ndash; in the terms 
of Kaarlo Tuori&rsquo;s multi-layered system of law &ndash; be described as a part of the &raquo; deep 
structures &laquo; of law in the Norwegian community33. In this societal, cultural climate, 
security nets of compensation have great legitimacy. There are good compensa-
tion systems for patients ( close to strict liability, full compensation ), for victims of 
crime ( compensation with a cap of 40 G &ndash; approx &euro; 430,000 ), for victims of car ac-
cidents ( strict liability, full compensation ). Most important is, however, the social 
security system, which aims at granting victims of certain kinds of severe health 
deterioration adequate compensation. The main requisite is that the citizen has 
an &raquo; illness &laquo; ( &raquo; sykdom &laquo; ) in the eyes of the law. If so, qualification for further requi-
sites will result in payment of social security benefits. As for social benefits com-
pensating loss of income, the victim is granted as much as 60 % from the social 
security system. After the new revision of the system, many citizens will qualify for 
compensation equivalent to 66 % of their income. The calculation system is, how-
ever, constructed in a way that leaves the victim with less income in many cases 
because the compensation is based on the income of the best three of the five

<p>years preceding the illness or disability constituting the right to benefits34. Still, it 
is fair to say that society takes good care of citizens, something that &raquo; oils &laquo; the sys-
tem35. The current discussions concern which heads of compensation should sup-
plement the social security benefit system36. In the last few years the discussion 
has revolved around whether the victim should be compensated for loss of house-
keeping capacity and, for example, the loss of the ability to bring up children with 
special qualities following from the day-to-day relations between parents and chil-
dren. The tort law debate is, on the one hand, elaborated on a level that suits a 
highly civilized society. On the other hand, one cannot avoid thinking that some 
claims are based on an unhealthy mentality of claiming money for every conceiv-
able situation that is perceived as negative from the victim&rsquo;s point of view. Still, 
there is after all a strong sense of justice at the root of the reasoning in favour of 
the claimants. Harm should be compensated as far as possible.
</p>
<p>As for the other areas of law related to tort law, the analysis of Germanic law 
in Basic Questions I, chapter 2, contains reflections and outlines that are both rel-
evant and valid to tort law, for example, the interplay between tort law and crimi-
nal law or insurance law. Other parts of the set of protective rules mentioned have 
especially designed provisions that make up an equivalent to the Germanic sys-
tem presented.
</p>
<p>II. Examples of supplementing rules
</p>
<p>In addition to the classic tort law rules, there are special rules for special problems. 
For example, under Norwegian law there is a codified right to self-defence ( see skl. 
&sect; 1&ndash;4 second sentence ). When a victim is attacked, he may defend himself even at 
the expense of the tortfeasor without having to pay damages. The question of excess 
has, however, not been discussed within the doctrine. Another example is the set of 
special rules on creditor avoidance within an Act of creditor satisfaction. The classic 
&raquo; actio Pauliana &laquo; is codified in &raquo; Dekningsloven &laquo; ( dl.) &sect; 5&ndash;937. The provision has sev-
eral cumulative and alternative requisites related to the act of the debtor. If he, for 
example, in an unacceptable manner pays one selected creditor to the detriment of

( Prop.) 150 L ( 2010&ndash;2011 ).
</p>
<p>35 Of course the word &raquo; oil &laquo; is carefully chosen in this context. The very basis of the smooth Nor-
wegian system is the national prosperity achieved by exploiting the natural resources of oil 
underneath the North Sea.

ing the basic needs of the citizen.

<p>the other creditors and he knows or ought to have known that their financial state 
was significantly worsened by the act, the disposition is declared void and the as-
sets must be brought back to the estate of the debtor. The provision in dl. &sect; 5&ndash;12 pre-
scribes a reimbursement of the full value of the assets being subject to avoidance, 
hence the bankruptcy estate is entitled to claim the loss of the estate covered, pro-
vided that the creditor benefiting acted in bad faith. If the profiting party acted in 
good faith, however, the claim is limited to the remaining gained asset of the credi-
tor38. In this way there is a sort of proportionality between the requisites and the 
sanctions. In the case that the requisites mentioned are not met, the creditor may 
always fall back on the general tort law rules39. Creditor avoidance has historically 
been categorized as a claim in tort, and the culpa rule is not abolished only because 
a certain provision securing the creditor&rsquo;s position has been enacted.
</p>
<p>As for injunctions there has never actually been a comprehensive doctrine de-
veloped within Norwegian private law. There are, however, fragments of injunc-
tion rules in different areas, such as neighbours&rsquo; law or the law of house rental40. 
These are provisions prescribing that a party is not entitled to carry out some par-
ticular activity and that he is compelled to respect the other party by omitting to 
do what he may desire. This occurs most often as a reflection of the right of the 
holder of some kind of property right. There are many such rules within the area 
of private law and it will not be of much interest to refer to them all in detail. An 
account of the general system may be formulated as follows: the possibility for a 
party to obtain an injunction against another party depends on whether there are 
economic sanctions available in the area of law. Sometimes the economic sanc-
tions may be converted into an injunction. In addition there are certain proce-
dural rules in the law of execution that will help a party to obtain the same effect 
as an injunction. For example: if A sees that B is building an unstable wall in his 
garden adjacent to A&rsquo;s patio, then A may sue B, claiming a &raquo; midlertidig forf&oslash;yning &laquo; 
( &raquo; temporary injunction &laquo; ) which means that B has a duty to stop building, other-
wise A may get help from the police to make B heed the injunction41. In an ordi-
nary case for the civil court, a judicial decision may be taken deciding the rights 
or duties of a citizen ( &raquo; fastsettelsesdom &laquo; ) confirming that B does not have a right 
to build the wall by virtue of A&rsquo;s property rights. The claim for a temporary injunc-
tion revolves on proving that it is more probable than not that A has such a right 
that must be respected by B 42.

<p>Thus, if the victim&rsquo;s property rights are threatened, he may refer to the legal 
system for assistance by claiming a &raquo; midlertidig forf&oslash;yning &laquo; &ndash; a temporary restric-
tion of the tortfeasor&rsquo;s act that fulfils the same function as injunctions known to 
common law. The main requisite and challenge for the victim is to prove that he 
is more likely than not subject to an infringement of his property rights43. If such 
a condition is fulfilled, the court will reach a decision that allows the victim to use 
the power of the legal system for execution of his rights. This means, for example, 
that he may have the assistance of the police in order to retrieve his good or to 
stop an activity that amounts to a nuisance44. Afterwards, the claimant may have 
to prove his right in court by using the ordinary system of litigation.
</p>
<p>III. On the law of unjust enrichment
</p>
<p>Under Norwegian law there are no strict boundaries between tort law and unjust 
enrichment. Nonetheless, for a long time scholars have recognised that tort law 
cannot fulfil the same function as special rules on unjust enrichment. In 1919 the 
influential theorist Fredrik Stang already pointed out that tort law was not a legal 
basis upon which to claim that a defendant has to pay restitution or a disgorge-
ment following his infringement of the victim&rsquo;s property right45. Tort law could 
not be a legal basis for anything but a payment of compensation for pecuniary 
and to a certain extent non-pecuniary loss. These insights were renewed in a more 
recent theoretical work by Erik Monsen, where the legal basis for claims of resti-
tution and disgorgement of profit was thoroughly examined46. Monsen holds that 
said claims must be established outside the &raquo; paradigm of tort law &laquo;47. The law of 
unjust enrichment has certain principles that find support in certain statutory 
provisions, but nonetheless a clear and broad principle of disgorgement of profit 
has not yet been established48.
</p>
<p>Although a distinction between tort law and unjust enrichment has been 
made by theorists, the Supreme Court has not always respected the distinction. 
The Supreme Court sometimes labels claims that are actually about unjust en-
richment as tort claims ( see Rt. 1981, 1215, the Trollheimen  judgment ). An owner 
of a flock of reindeers knowingly let the animals graze on another man&rsquo;s land for 
several years. A claim for restitution due to the fact that the former had unlawfully

<p>used property for reindeer was labelled a tort claim. At the same time it was clear 
that the claim was based on what would be a reasonable payment for the use of 
land, not the actual loss on the part of the landowner. The decision gave rise to a 
special principle: one who knowingly uses another man&rsquo;s things or property for 
his own purpose should as a general rule pay a reasonable rent for the use.
</p>
<p>This is one of several decisions which, together with a series of provisions in 
various private law Acts, form the legal basis of restitution for unjust enrichment 
within Norwegian law49. Monsen has argued that the many positive decisions and 
provisions within Norwegian law constitute bases for general principles of the 
kind mentioned above in connection with the reindeer case. Another such princi-
ple is related to the copying of products for sale: Monsen maintains that one who 
copies another man&rsquo;s work should pay disgorgement of the profit he has gained 
by doing so.
</p>
<p>The overall impression is that the question of restitution is not really a threat 
to tort law rules or vice versa. The fact ( and the recognition of the fact ) that claims 
are motivated and assessed in different ways seems very clear to lawyers and aca-
demics working in this field of law50.
</p>
<p>Interference with other citizens&rsquo; rights and property may amount to a tort, 
hence the victim is in a position to claim recovery of his loss. Sometimes the in-
terference leads to a profit for the interferer, typically when someone uses another 
man&rsquo;s work of art or idea. The important question is whether in such cases there 
is a legal basis for claiming disgorgement of profit. It is important to note that 
the assessment of damages in tort law does not allow for such claims. The solu-
tion may, however, be acceptable based on some special provisions on the pro-
tection of property in various situations51. Monsen argues that a general princi-
ple should be recognised that prescribes disgorgement of profit for anyone who 
exploits other people&rsquo;s work or property in order to gain profit52. To date the Su-
preme Court has been rather reserved and there are no traces of such a develop-
ment within the court practice.
</p>
<p>49 An important rule is Lov om hendelege eigedomsh&oslash;ve ( &raquo; Act on Coincidental Ownership &laquo; )  
10 April 1969 no 17 &sect; 15, prescribing that one who knowingly profits from using another man&rsquo;s 
property must pay the profit to the owner.

a comprehensive manner in the above-mentioned thesis by Monsen, Berikelseskrav.

</p>
<p>IV.  On the coherence problem addressed in  
Basic Questions I
</p>
<p>The concerns raised by Koziol in Basic Questions I that the system be coherent and 
that the various principles and rules are not used for purposes or functions other 
than those initially intended, are also important to Norwegian law. The sense of 
order, the need for sound distinctions and caution in the application of various 
sanctions is an issue of justice for citizens. The academic approach to tort law 
should be conscious of the role tort law plays in the interplay of rules protecting 
property rights and other rights of citizens. As for Norwegian law, the somewhat 
pragmatic approach as well as the historical development of tort law, however, 
leaves a different picture of the system than the Germanic survey. To a certain ex-
tent tort law serves both as an origin of other remedies and as a sort of security 
net &ndash; a guarantee for a possibility to reach reasonable solutions in concrete cases. 
There has not been any articulated fear that the solutions based on other sets of 
rules contradict or undermine tort law. Perhaps one of the reasons is the meth-
odological approach of Norwegian private law. Although the government at one 
point in time had ambitions regarding a book of civil law, these have never been 
carried out. Only fragments of positive law have been enacted at various times 
and with no actual comprehensive approach. Hence, the ideas of coherence and 
comprehensiveness have been left to judges, to some extent guided by a few well 
known books on private law. This approach has left tort law as a sort of back-
ground law, a set of principles that may amend any kind of deficits within other 
areas of law53. Part of the reason for this is that, according to the historical view of 
private law, contract and tort were the two possible geneses of money claims54. A 
well-educated jurist, who knows his private law, will have the possibility to adjust 
prerequisites and effects in an intelligent and proportionate manner. If a case con-
cerns the exploitation of another&rsquo;s commodity without paying an appropriate fee, 
the open rules on unjust enrichment make it possible for the commodity owner 
to claim the payment of the gain he made, regardless of whether he has suffered 
a loss that will qualify according to tort law principles. Appropriate solutions are 
also available for vindication ( rei vindicatio ) and regarding preventive expenses.
</p>
<p>The approach seems to function well as far as the development of private law 
is concerned. The drawback is of course that the rather free and unchained ap-
proach to such questions sometimes features a lack of foreseeability. On the other 
hand, the system provides for a possibility to produce tailored decisions. Jurists in 
general do not misuse tort law, rather they apply it as a tool for fair and just deci-
sions. The jurist will, for example, know that criminal law will take care of preven-

<p>tive aims and that there are rules of self-defence embedded in the tort law rules55. 
In the uncodified private law principles there is a clear principle of res vindicatio. 
Thus, there are good possibilities to achieve just results without twisting or bend-
ing the tort law rules. Koziol&rsquo;s other concern is that the idea of compensating the 
damage and nothing more is deviated from in favour of punitive damages, which 
may go beyond the purposes and functions of tort law. An important point is that 
public law should have the task of performing penal functions, whereas tort law 
should not be overburdened with such a task. As for Norwegian law, this does not 
seem to be an immediate threat. The limits set by the requisite of pecuniary loss 
are almost never transgressed, although scholars in recent years have advocated a 
more instrumental approach to tort law, advising that monetary sanctions should 
be imposed in order to achieve various preventive effects56. An assessment along 
these lines is advocated in theoretical works concerning unjust enrichment and 
infringements of intellectual property rights57. The Supreme Court has, however, 
never assessed damages in tort law cases in a manner which includes punitive

<p>Part 3 The tasks of tort law
</p>
<p>The main purpose of tort law is to provide for a system that compensates the vic-
tim. The so-called &raquo; idea of reparation &laquo; is perceived as profound and is represented 
in many aspects of tort law rules. One important such expression of the idea is the 
principle of &raquo; compensation in full &laquo;. The victim should economically be restored 
to the position that he would have enjoyed had the damage not occurred. There 
has been a certain disbelief in the idea of prevention within Scandinavian law58. 
A variation of this attitude is the idea that there are mechanisms other than the 
threat of monetary sanctions that motivate people to not injure others59. Lead-
ing scholars have simply not believed that the fear of an economic sanction can 
motivate private citizens to act carefully. The opinion has rather been that the 
private citizen will try not to harm his fellow citizen for other, more altruistic and 
ethical reasons. Hence the predominant view has been that the tort law rules will 
not have any preventive effect in themselves60. This stance has been paired with 
an almost similarly outspoken confidence in insurance-based solutions61. The lat-
ter has also been developed in an environment dominated by high ambitions for 
providing welfare for citizens. A symptom of this way of thinking is that the social 
security funds &ndash; as mentioned above &ndash; can no longer file a recourse action against 
the tortfeasor for social benefits that actually cover the damage caused by the tort-
feasor62.
</p>
<p>Alongside the views mentioned, there has also been a belief in ideas of &raquo; eco-
nomic prevention &laquo;, especially concerning the organisation of security systems in 
business activities. It is held that, if factory and other business owners are held 
liable for the damage they cause, they will implement security measures, hence 
a preventive effect is the result. At this point, the ideas of prevention are to a cer-
tain extent influenced by law and economics63. The insights of law and econom-
ics have otherwise played a rather modest role in the realm of tort law thinking.

<p>Only a few scholars have addressed such issues, and there are very few compre-
hensive works on the subject within tort law64. The prevailing view seems to be 
that law and economics operates with too many simple and general presupposi-
tions and that the rationality of law and economics does not capture the moral 
questions that are inherent in tort law. Still, in certain areas the insights of eco-
nomics can no doubt be helpful; however, not as a replacement for tort law but 
only as a supplement to tort law reasoning. The notion of continuation of a right 
( &raquo; Rechtsfortsetzungsgedanke &laquo; ) has no accurate or immediate equivalent within 
Norwegian law.

<p>Part 4  The area between tort and breach of an 
obligation
</p>
<p>The boundaries between claims in contract and in tort are quite unclear. There 
have historically been attempts to clarify the difference, but modern theorists 
seem to maintain that the difference is not so important65. The distinction may 
also be of minor importance because the claimant anyway may choose whether he 
wants to build his monetary claim on a contractual or delictual basis. The claim-
ant will sometimes choose to base his claim on both, for example, principally in 
contract and subsidiarily on the law of torts.
</p>
<p>In some contractual areas there is a tradition that claims are based on delict, 
typically personal injuries which occurred during the performance of a contrac-
tual duty. On other occasions the fact that the claimant has a contract serves as 
an additional argument, among others, to decide the case on a delictual basis66. 
This is particularly evident in cases of employers&rsquo; liability. The fact that there is a 
contract between the employer and the claimant is relevant to the judgement con-
cerning how far the scope of liability reaches67. On this point there is also room 
for tailored decisions, where the special merits of the case may be thoroughly ex-
amined.
</p>
<p>The categorisation of constellations in the interim area is interesting from a 
scholarly point of view. There have not been any attempts at corresponding sys-
temisation within the Norwegian and Scandinavian doctrinal literature. The prob-
lems of the interim areas seem rather to be addressed only where the existence 
of the contractual elements is relevant in a concrete context. At the same time 
there are interesting academic works that challenge the interim areas. According 
to Norwegian law, a potential contractual party who causes a loss to his possible 
future contractual partner is liable in tort, still with an eye to the special impact of 
the possible contract68. The responsibility for auxiliaries may be affected by neigh-
bour relationships between the principal and the victim. Hence elements of a sort

<p>of contractual relationship between two neighbours are relevant to the question 
of vicarious liability.69
</p>
<p>Norwegian doctrine seems to have an open approach to the interim areas. 
There is a danger that the relevant perspective of a case is not taken into account 
because the court focuses on one of the approaches. An example is that court de-
cisions on employers&rsquo; liability have been criticised for not paying attention to the 
contract involved70.
</p>
<p>A crude outline of the difference between claims in delict and claims in con-
tract may be given thus: liability in contract is stricter, often operating with culpa 
with a reversed burden of proof or strict liability &ndash; or most often something close 
to strict liability71. At the same time there is liability for fault in the case of auxilia-
ries in their performance of a contract, whereas there is no liability for the faults of 
an independent contractor. Lastly, it is in general easier to obtain compensation 
for pure economic loss in contract than in delict. There is a well settled doctrine 
on compensation for loss of profit, and such compensation also has a legal basis 
in sales law, which forms a sort of model law for many contractual relationships72.

<p>Part 5 The basic criteria for a compensation claim
</p>
<p>I. The basic criteria related to damage
A. Introduction
</p>
<p>The basic criteria for a compensation claim under Norwegian law are quite similar 
to the Austrian criteria; however, they are not very clearly embedded in statutory 
legislation. The criteria are above all based on long-standing and consistent court 
practice. The main criteria are that there has to be damage &raquo; relevant to tort law &laquo;, 
that there must be a ground for liability and that there has to be a causal link be-
tween the factual act or condition that constituted a ground for liability and the 
damage.
</p>
<p>B. The concept of damage
</p>
<p>The notion of damage relevant to tort law is really a phrase that refers to a set of 
normative, value-based guidelines upon which incidents or changes in the vic-
tim&rsquo;s position qualify for compensation. For several reasons the boundaries of the 
concept of damage within Norwegian law are not very clear. For a Norwegian law-
yer reading the theoretical works of Germanic literature, it is noteworthy how poor 
the Norwegian law is on exactly this point. The standard text books have only ad-
dressed the questions in a superficial way, leaning on older theoretical works pro-
duced for another time and other societal and cultural conditions. However, some 
of the problems have been addressed in recent years, although there is a certain 
lack of comprehensiveness in the approach73.
</p>
<p>The concept of damage and the more detailed criteria for compensable dam-
age follow lines resembling those put forward in Koziol&rsquo;s account ( in Basic Ques-
tions I ) of damage in Austrian law, however with a more crude and open, and also 
somewhat loose approach. A starting point is that the victim must have suffered 
some kind of &raquo; realskade &laquo;, directly translated this means &raquo; real damage &laquo;. The con-
cept is defined as a &raquo; negative effect &laquo;74. If this effect is loss of money or a negative

</p>
<p>effect upon a property that may be assessed in money, there is a pecuniary loss; 
hence there is no doubt of relevance and compensability. The same is true for ex-
penses caused as a result of the acts of the alleged tortfeasor.
</p>
<p>Doctrinal problems and difficulties for case law begin to emerge whenever 
there is a kind of negative effect that is difficult to measure in money. Borderline 
cases are, for example, the shooting of wild geese, so that the government had to 
release new geese into the environment ( RG 1979, 715 ) or loss of use75. The ques-
tion of whether the damage is calculable may or may not be of importance in bor-
derline cases. There are no clear rules on this point.
</p>
<p>In some areas the Supreme Court has, however, established a quite consist-
ent practice, to a certain extent guided by the decisions of the European Court of 
Human Rights. The provision in skl. &sect; 3&ndash;6 is a legal basis for compensating the in-
fringement of the private life of a victim. Recently there has been a series of cases 
regarding press coverage of private situations, such as the wedding of a pop star 
and an actress that took place on a little island on the coast, where paparazzi pho-
tographers uninvitedly took pictures of the ceremony76, and the case of two reality 
stars who became a couple in a 24-hour filmed house ( Big Brother ) but later broke 
up, claiming that this was not a matter of public concern77. The reasoning in these 
cases follows the arguments of the Caroline von Hannover case in the ECtHR. In 
the first case the press was acquitted, whereas the reality stars received compensa-
tion of NOK 50,000 ( &euro; 6,000 ).
</p>
<p>C. A &raquo; value based &laquo; ( &raquo; normative &laquo; ) delimitation of the concept  
of damage
</p>
<p>Even if it is possible to calculate the damage, there may be other problems relating 
to the qualification of the negative effect. The normative approach to this kind of 
problem is well illustrated in the case of the failed sterilisation of a woman who 
subsequently gave birth to a child whom she initially did not want to have ( Rt. 
1999, 209 ). The Supreme Court simply stated that the question of compensating 
the expenses of raising a child was normative and value-based. In consideration of 
the child, the parents themselves and of society, the Court found it best that such 
expenditure should not be compensated &ndash; the birth of a healthy child should not 
be regarded as damage relevant to tort law.78 The solution may be worth support-

</p>
<p>ing, but the reasoning is not very clear or principled. Still, the case shows that that 
what is a negative effect must be decided on the basis of what society in general 
would regard as negative.
</p>
<p>The normative and sometimes pragmatic approach to profound principles 
makes it easy to reach a sound result, and Norwegian courts therefore seldom 
need to apply complicated constructive arguments in order to fit the case into 
existing categories. Perhaps this is why &ndash; in the case of wrongful birth &ndash; the idea 
of reducing damages due to benefits received has not been aired. In addition, un-
der Norwegian law, the principle of &raquo; compensatio lucri cum damno &laquo; has been 
perceived as exclusively regulating pecuniary loss. The transfer of the thought to 
non-pecuniary loss would, however, be understandable to the Norwegian debate 
and may easily be presented as a supplementing argument to the existing solution 
of no recoverable loss. In fact, the idea that having a child is a positive event, and 
hence should be regarded as some kind of advantage in the eyes of the law, is al-
ready expressed in the Norwegian debate on the subject, however not with a link 
to &raquo; compensatio lucri cum damno &laquo;79.
</p>
<p>The idea of compensation for frustrated family planning would, however, 
have no solid ground in Norwegian law. Such frustrated expectations are neither a 
pecuniary loss nor an infringement that has a legal basis in statutory law. Hence, 
there would not be any legal basis for compensation. Even though the concept of 
damage and the boundaries of compensable loss have been discussed lately, there 
is probably no room for compensation on the mere grounds of interference with 
family planning choices.
</p>
<p>D. Non-pecuniary loss at the border of the concept of damage
</p>
<p>For a long time it was taken for granted that only pecuniary loss should be com-
pensated unless there is a statutory basis for compensating non-pecuniary loss80. 
In recent years this doctrine has been challenged on varied lines of reasoning. 
Several scholars have suggested that compensation should be awarded based on 
principles of reasonableness, although they have failed to produce any coherent 
or principled guidelines in order to assess what does and what does not qualify for 
compensation81. When such claims are brought, the traditional concept of dam-
age is challenged.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>There are several cases concerning expenses incurred in order to diminish the 
negative consequences of damage to a non-pecuniary interest or value: a woman 
was awarded damages as compensation for rental car expenses she incurred to en-
able her to have her holiday with her family as planned82. In this case, the Supreme 
Court acknowledged that the value of having a holiday was not a pecuniary inter-
est per se. Still, they argued that deprivation of the possibility to have a holiday as 
planned might amount to a compensable damage.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, property owners who wanted to build a wall to protect 
themselves and their property against noise from a motorway were not awarded 
any compensation for the expenses they incurred83. Although there was damage 
to a physical thing ( the car ) in the first case and only reduced enjoyment of a 
property in the second case ( because of the noise ), it is hard to draw the line be-
tween values that are protected by tort law and those not protected. The Supreme 
Court may have stated the law too broadly when it held that any expense incurred 
in order to repair or prohibit damage is to be compensated84. In fact the decision 
rests on very concrete arguments or fragments of theories that are internationally 
known as the doctrines of commercialisation and frustration ( Frustrationslehre ). 
The advantage of this state of law is that one will be able to reach a sound result in 
the concrete case at hand. On the other hand; such an approach leaves little fore-
seeability in this field of law.
</p>
<p>The Norwegian doctrine has not yet found any good solution to the problem 
of the boundary between pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss. The closest to a crite-
rion is the idea that values that are supported by most members of society should 
be protected by a tort law based sanction &ndash; compensation to the victim. In my 
opinion such an approach seems somewhat simple and based on discretion. The 
question ought to be investigated by a law committee with the task of rethinking 
the concept of damage in the light of modern developments.
</p>
<p>E. Special remarks on non-pecuniary damage
</p>
<p>Since there has never actually been any legal basis for punitive damages under 
Norwegian law, one may look for elements of such a remedy in areas where the 
legal basis of compensation allows punitive elements to be taken into account. 
At this point, the legal basis of non-pecuniary loss comes to the fore. There is a 
special legal basis for compensating non-pecuniary damage under Norwegian law 
( see skl. &sect; 3&ndash;5 ). This provision reads that pain and suffering caused by gross neg-

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>ligence or intent may be compensated by an amount assessed at the discretion of 
the court. The Supreme Court has, however, established a consistent practice on 
the most common types of injuries, such as homicide and rape and various vio-
lent infringements of physical integrity. In such cases awards are to some extent 
standardised by the court practice85.
</p>
<p>Historically, an important reason for compensating non-pecuniary loss was 
the penal effect of economic sanctions86. An interesting development of recent 
years is that the Supreme Court has expressly moved the focus of attention from 
the original penal function to a more outspoken aim of compensating the victim87. 
The idea of actually compensating a bad experience, fear, pains or bereavement by 
money has come more to the fore. In past decades the recognition that some nega-
tive effects are impossible to compensate and to measure by economic standards 
constrained the willingness to compensate. In many decisions from the last years, 
one can, however, observe a tendency to compensate for the negative non-pecuni-
ary effects by monetary awards. A consequence of this change of view is that the 
awards have risen substantially. A peak seems to have been reached in a recent 
case, where a person was shot twice in his torso and became severely disabled for 
the rest of his life with continuous pain. The award solely for non-pecuniary loss 
was &euro; 70,000, an amount which clearly exceeds earlier levels88.
</p>
<p>The picture is, however, blurred by the fact that the Supreme Court has a 
methodological principle of using the level of penalties within criminal law as a 
guideline for awards. The level of penalties has increased substantially over the 
last years mainly due to preventive aims. The level of penalty &ndash; the length of the 
criminal punishment &ndash; is a parameter for the discretionary assessment of com-
pensation for non-pecuniary loss. This fact means that the gravity of the act in-
directly has a great impact on the amount of the award, apparently in a way that 
resembles the idea of punitive damages.
</p>
<p>In this area of law, the many compensation cases brought by young people 
who were injured in the Ut&oslash;ya massacre in 2011 have had an influence. The of-
fice administering the Victims of Crime Compensation Scheme was overruled by 
an appeal to the Board of Compensation for Victims of Crime ( &raquo; Voldsoffererstat-
ningsnemnda &laquo; ). The Board granted the victims higher awards than previous prac-
tice suggested, by reference to the very special circumstances of the violent acts 
( the great fear and the horrific experiences ). This was probably a wise decision.
</p>
<p>85  The latest adjustment of this practice is found in Rt. 2010, 1203 ( &euro; 25,000 for homicide ) and  
Rt. 2011, 743 ( &euro; 18,500 for rape ).

<p>The effect is, however, that the general level of awards will increase. The Supreme 
Court has in other cases looked to the practice of the Board89. It is therefore likely 
that the Ut&oslash;ya decisions will eventually have an impact on the Supreme Court 
practice.
</p>
<p>F. Future perspectives
</p>
<p>In my opinion there is a certain logic to the fact that non-pecuniary damage is bet-
ter compensated now than previously was the case. As the level of civilisation and 
welfare has increased within western culture, citizens have greater expectations 
as regards a good and comfortable life. And as opposed to the attitude of earlier 
times, a citizen of a welfare-based legal order will, to some extent, take the fulfil-
ment of a good life for granted. A reflection of this development is a demand for 
compensation for any frustration of the expected good life. Of course this demand 
will also comprise non-pecuniary damage. A victim may find it very hard to grasp 
why he should put up with devastating acts or great pain with no or only symbolic 
compensation. A consequence of this development is that a higher level of com-
pensation than before is, in the eyes of the population and the law-making insti-
tutions, legitimate.
</p>
<p>The same effect may partly explain the quest for a new head of damage within 
Norwegian law. The law committee preparing the new draft on standardised per-
sonal injury awards was, practically formulated, instructed by the government to 
suggest a provision on compensation for pain ( Smerteerstatning ) using Danish law 
as a model. It has for some time been a debatable point in Norwegian tort law 
that an uncompensated victim must tolerate being ill or suffering pain in cases 
where the tortfeasor only acted with negligence or where there is strict liability. 
The suggested new provision in the 2011 Draft is that a victim should be awarded 
a daily compensation amount for pain or sickness of 0.007 G ( approx &euro; 75 ) for the 
first week, and thereafter 0.0025 G ( approx &euro; 27 ). The total compensation for pain 
should not exceed 1 G ( approx &euro; 10,750 ).
</p>
<p>By way of these legal bases for compensation of non-pecuniary loss, there 
is probably no great pressure on Norwegian law to develop punitive damages 
through court practice, at least when it comes to tort law. The system of not grant-
ing compensation for non-pecuniary loss without a statutory legal basis seems to 
be strong and to meet the challenges of new times and new ideas. An element of 
punitive damages is more likely to be implemented in the law of unjust enrich-
ment. It is unsatisfying that a person may exploit another man&rsquo;s work without his

<p>II. Causation
A. Introduction
The Norwegian doctrine is based upon a &raquo; bifurcated approach &laquo; which is compa-
rable to the system both in Germanic law and in common law91. Firstly factual 
causation must be proved. Here the courts rely on the &raquo; but-for test &laquo;, more com-
monly known as the &raquo; conditio sine qua non test &laquo;. The second step is to elimi-
nate causes that have passed the but-for test but are so unsubstantial that they do 
not naturally constitute liability on the part of the tortfeasor. This is a normative 
qualification of the cause, which is sometimes hard to distinguish from the test 
of whether or not the cause is adequate. If the situation concerns a cause of mi-
nor importance in the whole picture of causes, the elimination of unsubstantial 
causes is the chosen procedure. If the question turns on a series of events follow-
ing from the tortious act, for example, in &raquo; cable cases &laquo; ( cases where electric cables 
have been destroyed, leaving many users of electricity without electric power ), the 
courts are more apt to approach the question in terms of adequacy92. Textbooks 
often deal with the substantial test in connection with factual causation, and ad-
equacy more distinctly as a normative limitation of liability. This is quite odd, be-
cause both the substantiality test and the adequacy test are based on strictly nor-
mative evaluations. Tradition, however, seems hard to alter.
</p>
<p>B. Alternative causes
</p>
<p>As regards alternative causes, the traditional doctrine has emphasised that a duty 
to compensate only exists where causation is proved more likely than not. The 
question is illustrated by an example of two men who pushed stones from a road 
and into a valley where a horse was grazing. If it is impossible to prove which of 
the two stones killed the horse, neither of the men will be liable. In modern theory, 
</p>
<p>90  Erik Monsen has argued eagerly for such a solution, see idem, Berikelseskrav ( 2007 ) 303 ff.
91 The expression &raquo; bifurcated approach &laquo; is used by Anglo-American scholars, see eg H. L. A. Hart /

</p>
<p>this solution is found to be less than satisfactory, and other solutions have been 
suggested. Nygaard points to the ethical blameworthiness of pushing rocks into 
the valley, and claims that solidary liability therefore is the best solution93. This 
approach resembles or is consistent with Bydlinski&rsquo;s view presented in Basic Ques-
tions I, no 5 / 79: because there is no proven causation, one may only deem the ac-
tor liable provided that there are strong arguments attached to other requisites, 
for example, the existence of blameworthiness. Recent theoretical comments 
have supported the solution presented in PEL Liab Dam94; solidary liability with 
a reversed burden of proof95. This solution is in fact also prescribed in the Pollu-
tion Act &sect; 5696: whenever a potential tortfeasor may have caused the pollution, he 
is solidarily liable with other potential tortfeasors unless he proves that he was not 
the cause of the pollution. The fact that this solution is chosen in the area of en-
vironmental law and not elsewhere probably has to do with the fact that the aim 
of protecting the environment has a strong political standing in Norway. The fact 
that there is a statutory provision prescribing this solution makes it conceivable 
or even probable that this solution may also be chosen in other fields. This would, 
however, be a dynamic interpretation of the general tort law rules and principles 
as they stand today.
</p>
<p>A variation of alternative causation is the hunters&rsquo; case; three hunters shoot 
at the same time. An innocent person is hit by one of the bullets; it is, however, 
uncertain which of the three bullets actually caused the damage. According to the 
general rule, there is no liability here, because it is not more likely than not that 
any individual hunter caused the damage. There are, however, indications that the 
courts will attach weight to the fact that all three shooters are involved in a danger-
ous operation. Two prominent scholars would follow this line of reasoning at least 
where there are two shooters97.
</p>
<p>C. On proportional liability
</p>
<p>The suggestions related to proportional liability would probably not be applied 
in Norwegian courts.98 The solution and the way of thinking are alien to current

<p>tort law. The ideas have not gained any support from contemporary scholars99. 
However, a law committee has applied this way of thinking and the special ra-
tionale in the course of setting up a new scheme for standardised personal injury 
awards. The committee has introduced lump-sum compensation for injured chil-
dren, stipulating average personal loss of income from work after school and in 
holidays. Statistics are referred to in order to find out how many young people of 
a certain year of birth would get a part-time job and how much they would earn. 
When the standardised personal injury award is based on such factors, the logic 
really is that the size of the standardised award is based upon the degree of prob-
ability of a loss100. At the same time it is not actually proportional liability in the 
ordinary sense of the concept, which revolves around probability of causation, not 
probability of suffering a loss. Still, the rationale is the same: for the individual 
victim, his or her award is decided by the generally assumed probability that this 
child would be among those getting a part-time job when it reached an age be-
tween 13 and 20 years old.
</p>
<p>A possible inference from this is that the idea of proportional liability broadly 
understood may in some of its facets be well suited for standardising awards. Once 
one leaves the concept of full compensation and replaces it with a crude stand-
ardised award based on different calculations and normative factors, it would be 
sensible to use statistics as a basis for assumptions on probability of outcomes. 
Subsequently, one may attach weight to the probability as a basis for the award. 
One may also see the approach as a variation of loss of a chance: the victim would 
have had a chance to get a part-time job had he not been injured. Now he instead 
gets compensation that reflects this chance.
</p>
<p>The concept of loss of a chance is hardly developed within Norwegian tort law. 
Only one theorist,  Strandberg, has analysed the problem thoroughly101. He only 
finds traces of similar ways of thinking within Norwegian law. For the time being 
there is no authoritative legal basis for claiming damages for loss of a chance un-
der Norwegian tort law.
</p>
<p>D. Cumulative causes
</p>
<p>As for cumulative causes ( Basic Questions I, no 5 / 111 f ), the solution of solidary lia-
bility is quite clear due to an old case, Vestfos, Rt. 1931, 1096. Two factories ( A and B )

</p>
<p>and a commune ( C ) were all polluting a river, poisoning drinking water for the lo-
cal inhabitants living by the river. When sued, one of the factories ( A ) maintained 
that the pollution from the factory was not a cause of the damage because the river 
would have been polluted by the other polluters ( B and C ) even if A had stopped 
polluting. The Supreme Court dismissed the argument by stating that the fact that 
other polluters were also involved could not exonerate A. Hence A was responsible. 
The other polluters were not sued, but they would probably be equally responsible 
had they been sued. Solidary liability would be logically consistent with the out-
come of the case.
</p>
<p>It is interesting that the judge&rsquo;s reasoning did not really depart from the rule 
of conditio sine qua non. The main motivation for deciding solidary liability was 
the idea that otherwise all the three possible causes might have to be exonerated, 
a point that is articulately expressed in the wording of the decision. Suppose that 
both of the factories had stopped polluting, the commune would have continued 
polluting and as such been the sole cause of the pollution. Based on this line of 
reasoning, it is somewhat unclear how far the decision reaches. But even though it 
does not directly solve the classical concept of cumulative causation, it is a strong 
argument in support of solidary liability when cumulative causes are concerned. 
Partly because of the 1931 decision, the theory on the subject distinguishes be-
tween reversible and irreversible damage102.
</p>
<p>Nygaard solves the problem by using a theory of causation that departs from 
the doctrine of conditio sine qua non. His theory prescribes three requisites for 
causation: the alleged causal factor must have been present, it must have had the 
potential to produce the harmful result, and this potential must have been real-
ised. By this test Nygaard accords weight to what really happened instead of a hy-
pothetical inference of what might have happened had the causal factor not been 
present103. In the Vestfos case the test would provide for an inference of causation 
both on the part of the factory and the commune.
</p>
<p>The special reasoning in the  Vestfos  case, may, however, not be applied to 
cases of superseding causes, the classic example being when an alleged tortfea-
sor shoots a horse after it has been fatally hit by a car. If the horse is already dead, 
there is no liability on the part of the shooter. A more complicated example is that 
A shoots to kill B at a point in time where B has already been poisoned by C and 
is doomed to die within a few hours anyway. For a long time there has been a de-
bate on how this problem should be solved104. Nygaard holds that both tortfeasors 
</p>
<p>102  Nygaard, Skade og ansvar 334.
103 The test has many similarities with the NESS test, as presented by R. Wright, see eg idem, Once 
</p>
<p>More into the Bramble Bush: Duty, Causal Contribution, and the Extent of Legal Responsibil-
ity, 54 Vanderbilt Law Review 1071&ndash;1077. The theoretical ideas are, however, developed com-
pletely independently and without knowledge of Wright&rsquo;s works.

</p>
<p>should be liable. He refers to his theory of putting weight on which causes were in 
fact active and thereby realized their potential: both causes did in fact at one point 
actively have an impact on the victim with the potential to lead to his death105. De 
lege lata probably the Vestfos case, and the tradition of solidary liability in cases 
where two or several tortfeasors are involved, will serve as supporting arguments 
for deeming both tortfeasors liable.
</p>
<p>E. Superseding causes
</p>
<p>Problems of superseding causes have been discussed for a long time under Nor-
wegian law, and it seems that these have now been settled. If the first causer has 
caused a finalized non-reversible damage, he will, however, be responsible in full 
for the entire damage. The second causer will not be liable at all106. The textbook 
example is that the first causer shoots a horse which dies. A variation of the prob-
lem is that A poisons B so that he eventually will die, but C shoots B fatally before 
the poison has killed him. In this scenario most theorists hold that both A and C 
are liable107.
</p>
<p>A principle of superseding causes is also applied when assessing personal in-
jury awards. A tortfeasor is only liable for loss of income ( or other heads of dam-
ages ) as far as the income would have been gained in the normal course of events. 
If the victim, for example, had a disposition to being ill and would not have worked 
after the age of forty, the tortfeasor should only pay relevant damages for the time 
period until the age of forty108.
</p>
<p>F. On causation in joined acts
</p>
<p>A case where A has a lookout role while B and C break into a store causing damage 
raises special issues within Norwegian tort law. If nobody comes around, the con-
duct of the guard ( A ) is not a conditio sine qua non for the damaging act. Still, he 
may be liable. Doctrine has traditionally suggested two solutions to the problem: 
firstly, the guard may psychologically have influenced B and C, inducing them to 
perform the damage, strengthening their intent109. In this way scholars have tried 
to construct a situation where the conduct of alleged tortfeasor A is a conditio sine

</p>
<p>qua non after all. Secondly, other scholars and court practice later suggested that 
A may be held liable in spite of the fact that the alleged tortfeasor&rsquo;s conduct does 
not qualify as a conditio sine qua non. Such an inference may be based upon a no-
tion of &raquo; common act &laquo;, a concept which builds on ideas of attributing the acts of 
A to B on the basis of their common goal or respective role in a greater operation 
with a certain intended outcome110. The famous NOKAS case highlights this rea-
soning: several men committed a burglary in a building that stored large amounts 
of cash. During the heist a policeman was killed. A person who was acting as a 
lookout, responsible for the escape cars, was found responsible for the killing of 
the policeman. He was of course neither a factual nor a psychological causal fac-
tor in the crime committed. In a recent doctoral thesis Hag land investigates thor-
oughly what kinds of connection between the alleged tortfeasor and the damage 
may replace the conventional causal factor requirement of the conditio sine qua 
non test. She claims that  elements of  identification are involved as well as  causal 
links that do not qualify as necessary causes111. By elements of identification, the 
thesis refers to the social-psychological tendency to perceive two legal entities as 
a unit112. Hagland combines the various previous theories and provides for a rather 
convincing theory on the contextual impact of causal links that do not meet the 
requirements of the conditio sine qua non test113.

<p>Part 6 The elements of liability
</p>
<p>I. Wrongfulness
A. Introduction
</p>
<p>Under Norwegian law, the doctrinal history of wrongfulness has been tied to a 
conduct based approach114. In the early parts of the 20 th century scholars believed 
that one could make a sort of formula for the boundary between lawful and wrong-
ful conduct within tort law and the application of the culpa norm. This assertion 
initiated a far-reaching Nordic debate on wrongfulness ( rettstridsl&aelig;ren )115. The 
controversy ultimately culminated in a common stance that wrongfulness in real-
ity was only a name for the result of a concrete elaboration that may be formulated 
thus: did the actor in the concrete case act differently than he ought to have done, 
all things considered ? Only reminiscences of the older doctrine were left and held 
by some scholars116. The mentioned elaboration has consumed the question of 
whether Acts, other written rules or unwritten customs have been violated. Such 
violation is of course a strong indication of culpability but, however, not necessar-
ily decisive. The conduct based approach has to a large extent solved the problem 
of distinguishing between wrongfulness and fault, because both concepts nowa-
days must be seen as angles or potential arguments relevant to a comprehensive 
criterion of culpa.
</p>
<p>The above-mentioned debate concerned only tort law, but &raquo; rettsstrid &laquo; ( &raquo; wrong-
fulness &laquo; ) has also been debated more generally. The question still arises from 
time to time as a part of the reasoning within private law, but it nowadays merely 
refers to a situation where rules of conduct are violated. It has thus no important 
place as a substantial question in legal reasoning.
</p>
<p>The methodological approach in modern private law is mostly oriented towards 
asking whether requisites for monetary sanctions are met. This applies, for exam-
ple, to the law of unjust enrichment. When it comes to questions of a duty to refrain 
from an action, the question of wrongfulness or unlawfulness plays a more impor-
tant and material part. The question often turns on whether an activity must be 
considered to contradict the law. If so, certain remedies are at the victim&rsquo;s disposal.
</p>
<p>114 Cf the dichotomy between conduct based and result based wrongfulness in Basic Questions I, 
no 6 / 15.
</p>
<p>115 A survey of the debate is given in Nygaard, Skade og ansvar ( 2007 ) 173. Salient opponents were 
F. Stang, A. Ross and W. Lundstedt, all leading scholars in the respective Scandinavian countries 
at the time.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Wrongfulness will, in certain areas of life, define the limits of the concept of 
damage ( see no 2 / 75 f below ). In other areas the question may be whether the al-
leged tortfeasor has transgressed his or her freedom to act without being hindered 
by the law ( see no 2 / 77 ff below ).
</p>
<p>B. Wrongfulness as the delimitation of the concept of damage
</p>
<p>Because of the conduct based approach to wrongfulness mentioned above, it is 
in general not appropriate to look upon minimum thresholds as something that 
has to do with wrongfulness. Under Norwegian law the subject must rather be ad-
dressed in connection with limiting the concept of damage. To cause negative im-
pacts that do not pass the minimum threshold is, however, not wrongful and does 
not involve compensable damage. This is actually a de minimis rule, even though 
commentators and other lawyers seldom speak about the rules in such terms. In 
neighbour law, a minimum threshold is connected to a principle of reciprocity. A 
common formulation is to say that every property owner has to endure some level 
of negative impact from his neighbour without compensation117.
</p>
<p>De minimis rules are also found in the Acts on product liability and the Act on 
Patients&rsquo; Personal Injuries118. As for non-pecuniary damage, there are several ex-
amples of minimum thresholds, the most predominant being that the impact on 
amenities must be &raquo; significant &laquo; ( &raquo; betydelig &laquo; ), this means transgress approx 15 % 
according to the table on &raquo; medical disability &laquo;. Within Norwegian tort law, a gen-
eral minimum threshold as such has never been debated. As explained below, the 
general stance is that the victim should be compensated in full. This also includes 
claims that amount to small sums of money.
</p>
<p>C. Wrongfulness as a delimitation of the freedom to act
</p>
<p>The Norwegian system does acknowledge that some acts, omissions or conditions 
contradict the body of rules and principles within the legal order, regardless of 
whether there are sanctions connected to the violation of the rule, and regardless 
of fault. Hence, if an employer fails to heed a rule on sufficient rest time for his 
</p>
<p>117 The principle is clearly stated in the preparatory works, see R&aring;dsegn 2 fra Sivillovbokutvalet 18  f. 
Minor nuisance up to a threshold must simply be endured as a part of the neighbourhood 
relations, in the preparatory works this threshold is called &raquo; t&aring;legrense &laquo; ( &raquo; threshold of endur-
ance &laquo; ).
</p>
<p>118 See Produktansvarsloven 23 December 1988 no 104 &sect; 2&ndash;3 ( 3 ); a threshold of NOK 4,000 ( ca 
&euro; 500 ), and Pasientskadeloven 15 June 2001 no 53 &sect; 4 first section; a limit of NOK 5,000 ( approx 
&euro; 625 ).

<p>133Part 6&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;elements&emsp;of&emsp;liability
</p>

</p>
<p>employees, his act may be wrongful; however, it is not necessarily regarded as a 
faulty act. The same constellation will occur where a child crosses a road despite 
a red traffic light. The act is in itself wrongful; however, there is no fault involved 
since the child lacks the personal ability to commit faulty acts according to the law.
</p>
<p>When it comes to non-pecuniary loss there is no direct link between wrongful-
ness and sanctions. Negligent behaviour that causes another man pain, for exam-
ple, running into another person on the street, may not give rise to compensable 
damage, but still the act is in itself no doubt wrongful119.
</p>
<p>This way of perceiving wrongfulness will often overlap with the doctrine of li-
ability for culpable acts. The reason for this is that the culpa rule in many areas 
of life represents the line between rightful and wrongful behaviour according to 
the requirements of the legal order. The culpa standard is perceived as objective; 
however, still in the sense that certain distinctions must be made. A person does 
not act culpably if the reason for his failing to act prudently was illness or lack of 
intellectual capacity. In the latter case, the question of culpa would be whether the 
alleged tortfeasor ought to have avoided a situation that he could not handle120. 
Correspondingly, a specially trained tortfeasor must be treated as such. A profes-
sional gym teacher must meet the standards for gym teachers and a person who 
acts as an attorney cannot be excused for mistakes only because he is young and 
inexperienced121. As for young children, they are regarded as lacking the capacity 
for blameworthiness. According to theory and practice, they gain such capacity 
only when they reach the age of seven; hence, the Norwegian system at this point 
is quite similar to German law.
</p>
<p>As for omissions, the Norwegian doctrine has for a long time considered this 
to be a question of the legal basis for liability. Firstly, the Norwegian doctrine has 
tried to even out the differences between tortious omissions and active tortious 
acts by emphasising that in both categories blameworthiness is based on the fact 
that the alleged tortfeasor should have performed an alternative act &ndash; he or she 
should have done something different. Secondly, the doctrine revolves around vari-
ous types of &raquo; tilknytning &laquo;; which means the &raquo; connection to &laquo; the risk that resulted 
in damage. If the tortfeasor had some kind of qualified connection to the risk, he 
should have reacted by doing something other than he did. The &raquo; Ingerenzprin-
zip &laquo; ( duty of someone who creates a dangerous situation to undertake something to 
avert the danger ) fits into this formula. The one who actively creates a risk has suf-
ficient connection to the risk and therefore the motivation to prevent it122.
</p>
<p>119 Compensation for pain and suffering is only granted provided that the tortfeasor has shown 
gross negligence or intent, see skl. &sect; 3&ndash;5. Thus, victims suffering pain caused by only simple 
culpa or an activity falling under strict liability do not have any claim for compensation.

</p>
<p>Sometimes a connection to the victim creates the connection to the risk123. 
Thus, the Germanic tendency to assign weight to the kind of relationship there 
is between the tortfeasor and the victim has a counterpart under Norwegian law: 
whether or not the alleged tortfeasor had a duty to act depends on his relation-
ship and, more precisely put, his connection to the victim. This connection may 
be based upon family, a contract or special duties of a job or position. If there is a 
family connection, the duties to act may increase, typically for the parents in their 
duties of care towards their children. Such an increased duty is supported and ex-
pressed by the legal order in the Acts regarding family law.
</p>
<p>Other connections may be based on simple everyday agreement ( a neigh-
bour looking after the flowers during a holiday ) or even looser and more tempo-
rary connections may exist. The connection must, however, have a minimum of 
strength and continuity to qualify. The doctrine takes the stance that there has to 
be some kind of connection to the victim that renders the tortfeasor liable as op-
posed to other people. Hence the pit example124 has a Nordic equivalent in an exam-
ple of a drowning man. A mere bystander has no duty to help and he cannot be 
held responsible for his omission to do so. The doctrine thus leads to the conclu-
sion that there is no liability in the pit-hole example. There is, however, one small 
difference between the pit situation and the drowning situation: of course it is 
much easier for the man passing by to alert the blind man of the pit than it is for 
the bystander to dive into the water in order to save the drowning man. This fact, 
paired with modern normative, altruistic attitudes may serve as arguments for lia-
bility in spite of the classic stance regarding the drowning man. It is, however, very 
doubtful that the courts actually would deem the bypasser liable. Court practice 
and theory suggests that the bypasser would be acquitted125.
</p>
<p>Norwegian law does not recognise any kind of lenient culpa standard within 
family relations. The culpa standard is perceived to be relative and to some extend 
tailored to the special relations the case concerns. However, any kind of leverage 
on the part of the tortfeasor based on his family relation to the victim would prob-
ably contradict the prevailing values of Norwegian law. If the family relation has 
any impact on the culpa standard at all, it would probably go the other way. Par-
ents may be subject to a special duty of care because of their children&rsquo;s supposedly 
weak position and corresponding need for protection by the legal order.
</p>
<p>Dangerousness may generate wrongfulness within the application of the 
Learned-Hand formula, but it may also constitute wrongfulness in itself, cf the doc-

<p>trine of strict liability for dangerous activities ( see no 2 / 101 ff below ). There are 
also many statutory provisions that establish strict liability for certain kinds of 
damage related to dangerous things, see, for example, the Act on Funfairs, the Act 
on Nuclear Activity, and the Act on Railways126. The liability clauses in these Acts 
are based solely on dangerousness. The activity in itself is of course not wrongful, 
but once damage is caused the owner or other legal subject involved is liable.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the elements of wrongfulness that are connected to conduct, and 
the elements that are connected to damage, are perceived as a continuum. This 
means that the act in itself, the mode of an operation in itself, is decisive and has 
a certain negative effect sufficient for the concept of relevant damage within the 
law of torts. This will be the case for illegal ways of competing on a market. To gain 
profit at the expense of a competing business is not wrongful in itself, and the loss 
of market shares will not per se be damage relevant to tort law127. However, if the 
profit is obtained by unlawful means, by acts that distort competition or in other 
ways contradict the rules of fair business activity, the competitor who has suffered 
a loss because of the acts may claim damages from the perpetrator128.
</p>
<p>A crude outline of the Norwegian perception of wrongfulness may be that it 
mostly refers to conduct, but may also refer to the concept of damage.
</p>
<p>II.  Misconduct in the sphere of the responsible party
A. Introduction
As under Austrian law, there is a whole cluster of rules stating that a principal 
should be responsible for the tortious acts committed by auxiliaries. There are 
two main rules on the subject. Firstly skl. &sect; 2-1 reads that an employer, regardless 
of his own conduct, is liable whenever his employee causes damage in a culpable 
way within the scope of his employment. The strict liability rule for the principal 
is justified by the fact that the employer and the employee have a close and lasting 
relationship with the purpose of supporting the interests of the principal. Hence, 
the rule only applies where there is a work relation in the eyes of the law, for which 
there are certain guidelines in the preparatory works. For example, the degree of 
instructive competence on the part of the employer, the element of agreement on 
wages by the hour, the question of whose equipment is used etc, will be relevant

<p>factors when deciding if there is a work relation qualifying for &sect; 2&ndash;1. In general, it 
is decisive whether the contract is aimed at producing a certain result or procur-
ing a service over a period of time. The latter alternative is a crucial feature of a 
work relation within &sect; 2&ndash;1129. Very short, unpaid services, for instance by a neigh-
bour buying bread, are not regarded as qualified.
</p>
<p>Secondly, a general principle states that a contracting party may be vicariously 
liable for people or entities he chooses to assist him in the activity of performing 
the contractual obligations130. The justification of this rule is very much tied to the 
obligation and the other party&rsquo;s expectations and need for foreseeability131.
</p>
<p>Conversely, the principal who engages a person or entity to perform some task 
as an independent contractor ( ie not as a servant ), is not liable for any conduct of 
the independent contractor, provided that the task is not a part of a contractual 
obligation. Hence, in order to avoid liability for damage caused by his auxiliary, it 
may be vital for the principal to prove that the harm was caused outside the scope 
of employment or outside the scope of fulfilling a contractual obligation.
</p>
<p>B. The rule of respondeat superior; skl. &sect; 2&ndash;1
</p>
<p>With regard to skl. &sect; 2&ndash;1, a justifying ground for strict liability on the part of the 
employer is the very fact that the employer employed the direct tortfeasor in order 
to have him pursue his interests ( including profit ). In addition, another signifi-
cant reason for the rule is the fact that it would be very difficult for the victim to 
provide evidence that the employer was culpable in his selection or supervision of 
the employee. Thus, strict liability serves both as a sort of presumption rule and a 
rule with preventive aims. As long as the employer knows that he will be liable for 
any tortious conduct by his employee, he has the incentive to pick the right people 
for the right tasks and to instruct them properly. The employer also has an incen-
tive to supervise and control132.
</p>
<p>As long as a significant reason for liability without fault is that the direct tort-
feasor is actually employed by the principal on a regular basis, the distinction be-
tween employees and independent contractors must be drawn carefully and dis-
tinctively. These limits of the scope of employment are to a large extent decided 
by the character of the working position and the question of whether the activity 
in which the faulty behaviour occurred was performed in the interest of the em-

</p>
<p>ployer. The reasoning in such cases turns very much on whether there is sufficient 
connection between the professional function and the harm done. One may there-
fore look upon the discussions of scope of liability as a sort of adequacy topic. The 
topic differs from ordinary questions of adequacy because the connection under 
scrutiny is between the function of the professional position and the actual dam-
age that took place133.
</p>
<p>Special attention is given to cases where an employee acts solely to pursue 
his own interests and goals, typically by stealing from or deceiving the people 
or businesses that the employer has contractual relationships with. In the pre-
paratory works of the mentioned rules, it is emphasised that the fact that the em-
ployee acted with intent in general will speak against liability for the employer. 
Still, there are several cases where the principal has been held responsible after all. 
The explanations for these cases are often that the danger of deliberate criminal 
acts is inherent in the business performed. For example, in the decision referred 
to in Rt. 2000, 211 a bank manager committed fraud by misusing his title and po-
sition, so that another bank suffered a loss of approx NOK 17 million ( approx &euro; 2 
million ). The fact that bank activity involves people having access to large sums of 
money makes it probable that the opportunities within the various professional 
positions are sometimes misused. This is regarded as a sort of calculated risk for 
the owner of the bank, and he must therefore be prepared to pay when a criminal 
activity occurs. If the criminal activity is too vaguely connected with the profes-
sional position of the employee, the principal will not be liable after all; see, for 
example, Rt. 1996, 687, where a caretaker in a building at night stole goods from an 
adjacent building to which he had access as a part of his professional position. In 
a very recent case, the Supreme Court highlighted a new issue, namely whether or 
not the victim should have been more careful; see Rt. 2012, 1765: an employee at a 
rental car service sold one of the rental cars for approximately half of the market 
value of the car. The fact that the buyer should have understood that it was a fraud 
was a decisive factor for acquitting the rental car company.
</p>
<p>These cases often fulfil the criteria for contract-based liability, because the vic-
tim is typically affected in connection with the principal performing a contractual 
obligation with the help of his employees. The fact that there is a contractual ob-
ligation involved may be a strong argument for liability even where the employee 
acts in a very unpredictable and criminal way ( see further on this in connection 
with &raquo; Erf&uuml;llungsgehilfe &laquo; below ). However, this argument often seems overlooked 
because the Supreme Court focuses on the positive criteria of adequacy in the rule 
on employers&rsquo; liability, skl. &sect; 2-1. The problematic aspects of this approach came 
to the fore in a case where a security guard set fire to the very building he was sup-

</p>
<p>posed to be looking after. Seen from the narrow angle of the employer&rsquo;s liability, 
one could argue that the misdeed fell outside what could reasonably be expected 
or what might be considered adequate in any way. Hence, the employer should be 
acquitted. On the other hand, the contractual approach strongly speaks against 
such a solution. The company which had entered into a contract to supervise the 
buildings had done so in order to avoid fire. When the security company, as a part 
of its performing of the contract, brought a pyromaniac into the picture, this was 
a clear breach of the contract, and something that it should be liable for134.
</p>
<p>C. Vicarious liability in contract
</p>
<p>Under Norwegian law, the other main rule is that a principal is liable without fault 
whenever an auxiliary wrongfully causes damage to a contracting party in con-
nection with his performance of a contractual duty. The justification for this li-
ability rule is simply that the contract must be fulfilled and for preventive reasons 
the contracting party must be liable for any error made or fault committed by his 
helpers and personnel within his sphere.
</p>
<p>The scope of the contract therefore often draws the boundaries of liability. 
The typical question would be whether some kind of negative effect on the part 
of the contract party may constitute a breach of contract. If so, the question is 
whether there is fault on the part of anyone in the principal&rsquo;s sphere. If this ques-
tion is answered in the affirmative, the principal will be liable.
</p>
<p>Of course there are limits to this approach, typically where objects other than 
the objects central for the contractual performance are involved. As for the typi-
cal example of damage to things in the flat of a purchaser who ordered something 
( Basic Questions I, no 6 / 108 ), the question of whether the principal is liable is 
quite open. Theorists have suggested that a first criterion would be whether the 
contract was a conditio sine qua non for the damage caused. This criterion may, 
however, not be precise enough and therefore leave too much responsibility with 
the principal. A suggestion has therefore been to accord weight to whether the 
damage occurred as a consequence of performing an element that is essential to 
the contract, which would involve liability, whereas a mishap during an activity in 
order to fulfil the more peripheral obligations of the contract would not involve li-
ability135. One scholar has tried to develop this thought further, by proposing a the-
ory that asks the question of whether the damaged good was deliberately exposed

</p>
<p>to the risk or not136. The Dutch idea of asking whether the contract increased the 
risk has not been aired in the Nordic doctrine. It may, however, be noted that this 
solution is very consistent with reasoning in other fields such as concerning ad-
equacy questions in general137 and the special adequacy test of employers&rsquo; liability 
described above138.
</p>
<p>Another twist to the problem is added when the auxiliary acts intentionally. 
The pyromania case cited above highlights many of the crucial questions on this 
point. The task of looking after the building put the pyromaniac in a position to 
do his misdeed. The case therefore highlights the points made in Basic Questions 
I, no 6 / 110: &raquo; the auxiliary gains the opportunity precisely by being entrusted &hellip; &laquo;. 
This argument may in itself be sufficient to render the principal liable, but I would 
guess that the contract being a mere condition for intentional, criminal acts may 
not suffice. It would for instance be too harsh upon a contracting party if this was 
the case when his &raquo; Erf&uuml;llungsgehilfe &laquo; ( an attorney, a plumber, a carpenter ) made 
an unprovoked physical attack on the other contracting party because he real-
ised that he coincidentally was an old enemy from primary school139. The question 
must in my opinion turn upon the proximity between the intentional damage and 
the performance of the contract that the contracting party has paid for. Thus the 
pyromania case is instructive: the intentional act damaged the very object that the 
pyromaniac was supposed to be looking after. The correspondence between the 
purpose of the contract and the intentional act of the auxiliary may in my opinion 
be a decisive criterion for liability140. Such a criterion would correspond with the 
Austrian reasoning connected to the main performance duty141.
</p>
<p>D. Liability for family members
</p>
<p>A special rule on liability based on family relations is skl. &sect; 1&ndash;2. This provision is 
relevant because it illustrates how family relations are dealt with when construct-

138 See above in no 2 / 92, furthermore the cases Rt. 2000, 211 and Rt. 1997, 786.
139  Peter Cane has pointed out that the contract must be relevant to the damaging incident, see 
</p>
<p>idem, Tort Law and Economic Interest ( 1996 ) 308. Norwegian tort law is compatible with the 
Germanic stance that the contract providing the auxiliary with the mere opportunity for doing 
damage is not enough, see for instance S. Mennemeyer, Haftung des Schuldners f&uuml;r Gelegen-
heitsdelikte seiner Erf&uuml;llungsgehilfen ( 1983 ) 109.
</p>
<p>140 There are strong indications that a decisive question is whether or not the damage is done 
to the object of the contract or not, see a special elaboration on this in Askeland, Erstatnings-
rettslig identifikasjon 222 ff. See also  K.  Lilleholt, Tingskade og kontrakt, in: G. Holgersen /

<p>ing liability rules within Norwegian law. The parents are liable regardless of fault 
for acts committed by their children that are deemed to be culpable &ndash; including 
negligent acts. Such acts are implicitly regarded as wrongful, however, it is the 
culpa rule in itself that is referred to in the wording of the mentioned provision. 
There is, however, a cap on the responsibility, as low as NOK 10,000 ( &euro; 1,200 ). The 
rationale behind the rule is prevention and the need for the victim to have the 
damage compensated. Furthermore, reference is made to &raquo; the general perception 
of justice &laquo; that parents out of decency would want to pay for the damage done by 
their children142. It may be fair to add that the general tendency to identify chil-
dren with parents and vice versa has also played a part. Under Norwegian law, sev-
eral rules of identification are justified by referring to a &raquo; psychological tendency 
to identify subjects with one another &laquo;143.
</p>
<p>E. Liability for organs
</p>
<p>The above-mentioned bases of liability include different variations of identification 
between a principal and an auxiliary who acts more or less on behalf of the princi-
pal. A sort of identification is also needed where a physical person acts on behalf 
of a legal entity, cf what in German law is called &raquo; Organhaftung &laquo;. Under Norwegian 
law, the same institute is established, partly inspired by German law144. The idea 
that certain physical persons represent the legal entity or &ndash; so to speak &ndash; literally are 
the legal entity has not been expressed in any Act, rather it is an uncodified general 
rule of the kind mentioned in no 2 / 1 ff above. This construction has limited practi-
cal significance because victims in most cases will be better off suing on the basis 
of respondeat superior, skl. &sect; 2&ndash;1. There are, however, certain rules where liability 
requires that the responsible subject in person has committed the tortious act. This 
is the case for non-pecuniary compensation for pain and suffering ( cf skl. &sect; 3&ndash;5 ). As 
mentioned above, this rule has a requisite of intent or gross negligence. In some 
cases the victim has to prove that the persons, being the organ of a legal entity ( a 
company ), have acted with gross negligence. Another area is within contract law, 
where sometimes the contract comprises a waiver stating that the contracting party 
is not liable for damage caused by grossly negligent conduct of his employees. The 
predominant opinion is that a contracting party, however, cannot validly present 
a waiver exempting him from the responsibility for his own grossly negligent con-

<p>duct. Therefore, the other party in the contract may try to prove that the damage 
was caused by an organ for the contracting company145. An example is the case in Rt. 
1994, 426: a cargo controller decided that heavy rolls of papers should be stored in a 
special manner in the cargo hold before being shipped to a destination across the 
Atlantic. The storage was negligent and the rolls fell and were damaged during the 
journey overseas. The shipping company succeeded in being released from liability 
on the basis of a waiver for the grossly negligent acts of employees. The court found, 
however, that the cargo inspector could not be looked upon as an organ of the com-
pany, hence the company was acquitted. The case shows that the question of which 
physical persons are in positions that allow attribution of liability to the company 
to some extent must be discussed on the concrete merits of the case.
</p>
<p>The question of which persons have to be considered as organs, however, has 
traditionally been answered by pointing to the highest levels of the company hi-
erarchy. Hence, the board and the chief executive may render the company liable. 
Also directors and managers on a lower level may be considered to be organs, pro-
vided that they are the head of a division that is the origin of the damaging act. 
An interesting question is whether an accumulation of minor mistakes or minor 
negligence by persons on a sufficiently high level in the company may amount to 
gross negligence, rendering the company liable. This question was answered in 
the affirmative in a case from the district appeal court, RG 1995, 1298. The court 
found that as many as seven persons on the top level of a company had cumula-
tively caused the death of a truck driver. His widow was awarded compensation for 
bereavement, something that requires gross negligence by the responsible party 
in person. In my opinion, the idea of cumulative gross negligence contradicts the 
idea of an organ of the company. Moreover, as long as the board of a company to-
gether may commit a tortious act as an organ of the company, there is no reason 
to establish liability based on the cumulative acts of another set of persons at the 
top level of the company.
</p>
<p>F. Dangerousness
</p>
<p>Dangerousness may constitute a basis for liability under Norwegian law. Back in 
the 19 th century the rule was that compensation only followed fault. As men in-
vented various production machines in the Industrial Revolution, it became clear 
that accidents might happen even if nobody were to blame for anything. The mere 
owning of an industrial plant could lead to damage, and there was of course a 
need for compensation when workers were injured during working hours. The so-

</p>
<p>lution was to interpret the culpa rule in a very strict manner146. This was a product 
of a certain kind of reasoning: the more dangerous the activity is, the more the 
situation calls upon the owner or actor to take care. Hence, the dangerousness af-
fects the duty of care. The duty of the owner became very strong, so strong that it 
was a short step to the category of strict liability.
</p>
<p>In 1897 a scholar stated that a rule of strict liability for &raquo; farlig bedrift &laquo; ( &raquo; dan-
gerous enterprise &laquo; ) was a part of Norwegian law147. In the subsequent decades the 
Supreme Court passed several decisions consolidating a general rule on strict li-
ability148. Certain criteria were developed: the damage had to be a result of a &raquo; con-
tinuous, typical and extraordinary risk &laquo;. These criteria are not precisely defined; 
they may be looked upon as variables149. Hence, if the damage is caused by a very 
typical risk of the enterprise or thing, the risk may not have to be correspondingly 
typical or extraordinary to the victim and vice versa.
</p>
<p>Independent of the stance concerning the character of the criteria, the courts 
have also taken into consideration other issues. It is quite well accepted that the 
overarching question is to decide &raquo; who is the closest to carry the risk &laquo;, a ques-
tion that invites a varied set of considerations. Among these is the idea that the 
person who profits should bear the consequences ( &raquo; cuius commodum periculum 
est &laquo; ), the question of whether or not it was convenient for the allegedly responsi-
ble party to take out insurance, analogies from expropriation rules, whether there 
was a technical defect and lastly considerations of what is reasonable on the con-
crete merits of the case. An interesting observation is that the Norwegian solu-
tion concerning dangerous activity eliminates the problems highlighted in Basic 
Questions&rsquo; account of European law on the subject150. Under the Norwegian, quite 
vague, rule there is no danger of being left with gaps that may not be addressed 
by judges. As long as there is considerable leeway for assigning weight to what is 
reasonable, and as long as the list of relevant arguments for practical purposes is 
open ended, there will always be possibilities for the informed judge to produce a 
tailored decision that really highlights the concrete merits of the case. Norwegian 
law may at this point be described as a sort of &raquo; topic method &laquo;151: a set of crudely 
formulated arguments are available to the judge. Within very wide boundaries 
judges are called upon to pass the best judgment all things considered &ndash; to inter-
pret the previous cases on strict liability so that the law can be seen in its best light.

</p>
<p>The method fits very well with the pragmatic approach that is dominant in 
many aspects of Norwegian private law152. There is very often argumentative room 
for a sound decision that is well-fitted to the concrete merits of the case. One 
should note that the development in this field of law is in accordance with the 
lawmaker&rsquo;s attitude. In many preparatory works of statutory law, the lawmaker 
makes a conscious choice to delegate the development of the law to the courts.
</p>
<p>The uncodified general rule of strict liability has functioned remarkably well, 
and many cases have found their just and fair solution through open and specially 
tailored arguments of the kind described above153. Still, the weakness of the ap-
proach is obvious: there is a lack of foreseeability in this field of law, something 
that invites litigation and complicates calculation tasks for the insurance industry.
</p>
<p>In my opinion, the most disturbing feature of the rule is that it invites a sort 
of analogous thinking that only works one way: if there is a Supreme Court case 
stating liability for a certain typical continuous risk, it is always possible to argue 
that a similar risk should qualify. As long as the issue is who should carry the risk 
and what is reasonable in the concrete case, it is only human that the judge may 
feel sorry for the victim in an individual case. One may fear that the continuous 
series of precedents may lead to an ever increasing area of liability. The Supreme 
Court has, however, in some important cases shown impressive integrity and un-
derstanding of its role as the factual lawmaker in this field of law. The Court, for ex-
ample, turned down a smoker who claimed compensation for his suffering from 
cancer and claims from pioneer divers who many years after their risky dives suf-
fered from subsequent illness154.
</p>
<p>III. An interplay of legal bases
</p>
<p>Norwegian tort law to a certain degree recognises an interplay of liability criteria. 
The most important example is liability based on &raquo; strict liability for a culpable ar-
rangement &laquo; ( &raquo; objektivt ansvar for uforsvarlig ordning &laquo; ), a legal basis that will be 
explained below. As already mentioned, under Norwegian law courts have consid-
erable room for discretion and development of tort law. Because of this, individ-
ual cases may be solved in ways that break new ground in terms of resting on an 
interplay between normative figures. For example, the burden of proof lies at the

<p>outset on the claimant, but is however sometimes shifted to the tortfeasor in order 
to reach a sound result155. There are also several examples of compulsory insur-
ance systems paired with strict liability156. These statutory Acts are motivated by 
the combination of recognised danger and recognised need to distribute the loss.
</p>
<p>Norwegian courts have historically developed an uncodified rule of strict lia-
bility that in most cases is seen as a clear alternative to culpability; see the outline 
of the strict liability for dangerous enterprises above ( no 2 / 101 ff ). In some special 
cases, however, the courts combine the reasoning that accords weight to the dan-
ger and the allocation of risk with more traditional arguments of culpability. The 
profound common feature of these cases is that there is a certain dangerous ob-
ject or arrangement which in itself will not pass the test of &raquo; continuous, typical 
and extraordinary risk &laquo;. It may be a hatch in the second floor of a restaurant ( Rt. 
1991, 1303 ) or a hot oven in a prison cell ( Rt. 1970, 1152 ) or breakable windows on 
the second floor of a mental institution making it possible for a patient to com-
mit suicide ( Rt. 2000, 388 ). These arrangements may not be permanent ( contin-
uous ) enough or dangerous enough ( extraordinary enough ) to constitute liabil-
ity in themselves. However, in combination with the fact that the risk could have 
been avoided if only very simple measures had been taken, the courts are willing 
to hold the alleged tortfeasor liable. The hatch in the restaurant floor might eas-
ily have been secured by proper locking and the breakable windows on the second 
floor could have been replaced by unbreakable windows at reasonable costs
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court does not explicitly proclaim that there is a certain cate-
gory of liability in between culpa and strict liability. Judges merely apply the argu-
ments in a concrete manner closely tied to the merits of the individual case. One 
scholar has named the category &raquo; strict liability for negligent arrangements &laquo;157. 
The categorisation and the recognition of certain types of cases have made it eas-
ier for judges to work with an interplay of misconduct and dangerousness.
</p>
<p>One may note that the fact that strict liability has developed via a very strict ap-
plication of the culpa norm makes it logical and rationally convincing that there 
is a middle category that blends the two bases of liability. If the courts have found 
reasons for strict liability in certain cases, surely there are reasons for a combina-
tion of strict liability and culpability.
</p>
<p>Even though the courts are willing to mix bases of liability, there has so far not 
been any trace of enterprise liability within Norwegian law. Because of the affinity 
with reasonableness and flexible criteria and the tendency to combine legal bases

<p>of liability, the possibility of liability on such grounds cannot be eliminated158. 
Product liability was instigated by Parliament, see the Product Liability Act of 
1988, which is designed to comply with the EU directive on product liability of 1985 
( even though Norway at the time was not obliged to do so ). Thus, the Act on Prod-
uct Liability was enacted a long time before Norway committed to the EEA Agree-
ment in 1992. The solutions in the directive were not really consistent with devel-
opments regarding product liability principles at the time which were based on 
court practice. The liability rule for products was the general culpa rule159. On the 
other hand, there have been cases based on strict liability that have been harder 
on the tortfeasor than what follows from the directive160. There has been a debate 
on whether the cases based on strict liability in fact contradict the directive to the 
extent that this directive has been perceived as totally harmonising the field of law 
within the European Union and EEA161.
</p>
<p>When it comes to defects in things, the existence of such may play a role ac-
cording to various legal bases. A technical defect may in itself be a reason for es-
tablishing strict liability under the uncodified rule. In fact, it has been maintained 
in the doctrine that the existence of a technical defect reduces the required level of 
typical and continuous risk162. The fact that the damage was caused by a defect is 
also an argument for strict liability via an emphasis on preventive effects: the risk 
of damage of this kind should be placed with the party who is able to avoid dam-
age by proper maintenance163.
</p>
<p>IV. Contributory responsibility of the victim
</p>
<p>In Norway, the question of contributory responsibility of the victim is regulated 
by a certain provision in the Compensation for Damages Act &sect; 5&ndash;1. Scholars have 
highlighted the notion that this is really a rule on responsibility of the victim164. 
Thus, in older literature it was emphasised that contributing to damage to your-
self was not a wrongful act165. Because of this, one had to establish fault or another 
recognised legal basis for liability on the part of the victim.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Scholars have pointed out certain differences between culpa of the  tortfea-
sor and culpa of the  victim. An important one is that the purpose of reparation 
of the damage sometimes induces a judge to conclude that the alleged tortfeasor 
was culpable, whereas the purpose of reparation does not have the same strength 
when it comes to the damage the victim has caused to himself ( by contributing to 
the damaging act )166. Furthermore, Nygaard holds that the demands society im-
poses upon the victim to take action to avoid damage is relatively modest com-
pared to the demands upon the tortfeasor167. The reduction may also be justified 
when it can be proved that the damage was partly caused by a dangerous thing or 
event in the victim&rsquo;s sphere168. This may be looked upon as an adverse version of 
strict liability.
</p>
<p>The rule also states that the victim or some entity within his sphere must have 
been a cause of the damage. Once contribution to the damage by an act or condi-
tion that satisfies the requirements of liability ( fault or strict liability ) is proved, 
the judge may reduce the award accordingly. The wording suggests a discretionary 
decision by the judge; however, court practice seems to be that a reduction will oc-
cur once the above-mentioned elements in the guidelines are present in the case 
at hand169.
</p>
<p>Hence, the rule states that, where a victim has contributed to the damage in 
a culpable manner, the claim should be reduced in proportion to the degree or 
quality of the causal contribution and the degree of fault. The provision also al-
lows &raquo; other circumstances &laquo; ( &raquo; forholdene ellers &laquo; ) to be taken into consideration. 
At least formally, the judge is left with discretion as to whether the claim should 
be reduced at all.
</p>
<p>The concrete discretion prescribed in the rule seems to have eliminated any 
attempts at establishing theories such as the equal treatment theory, even though 
elements of such a theory were put forward at the beginning of the 20 th century  170. 
The questions are solved as matters of interpreting the statutory provision. It is 
also pointed out that the purpose of reparation of the damage does not put pres-
sure on the victim in the same way as it does on the potential tortfeasors171. Apart 
from this, there are no traces of general theories of differentiation at play.

</p>
<p>One should, however, note that the statutory provision allows weight to be ac-
corded to the fact that the tortfeasor has the possibility of insurance172. The pos-
sibility of insurance on the victim&rsquo;s side is not mentioned, and court practice has 
accordingly been careful in referring to this point. The important principle of pro-
viding full compensation and consequently not reducing damages any more than 
there are sufficient reasons to do so, may play a part at this point. It may also be 
noted that the preparatory works mention that one is allowed to take into consid-
eration the social needs of the victim, either addressing this aspect under the word-
ing &raquo; the extent of damage &laquo; or &raquo; other circumstances &laquo;. In court practice this has led 
to modest reductions of damages in personal injury cases, especially where the 
victims are young. When applying the law thus, the court attaches weight to both 
the poor financial situation of the victim and its young age173. The relatively &raquo; kind 
climate &laquo; of Norwegian courts encourages judges to refrain from denying full com-
pensation to young people who have had their lives ruined by an accident. Such 
practice is most evident within motor vehicle insurance cases. It seems, however, 
to be a common understanding between tort lawyers that this kind of reasoning 
may also occur when applying the general rule of reduction ( skl. &sect; 5&ndash;1 )174. At such 
points there really are differences between how the tortfeasor and the victim are 
treated corresponding to their degree of fault and contribution to the damage175.
</p>
<p>V. Reduction on the basis of auxiliaries&rsquo; conduct
</p>
<p>The concept of &raquo; identification &laquo; refers to the mechanism of letting A pay for some-
thing B has done, either being held liable ( typically employers&rsquo; liability ) or having 
one&rsquo;s claim reduced because of a connection to another who contributed to the 
tortious act ( imputed contributory neglect ). The concept of identification is use-
ful when comparing the mechanism on the side of the tortfeasor with the corre-
sponding mechanism on the victim&rsquo;s side.
</p>
<p>Under Norwegian and Nordic doctrine, the equal treatment thesis is a sort of 
theoretical guideline for questions concerning imputed contributory neglect, but 
is, however, not decisive in any way. The equal treatment thesis suggests that iden-

<p>tification works in the same way on the tortfeasor&rsquo;s and the victim&rsquo;s side. Some 
scholars previously advocated such a doctrine, but the Nordic version seems to be 
that one must stretch the &raquo; identification &laquo; on the claimant&rsquo;s side at least as far as 
one does on the tortfeasors side176.
</p>
<p>At the same time, the question of imputed contributory negligence must be 
solved by a scrutiny of the concrete merits of the case, and the specific relevant 
arguments. This is an approach that also leaves the judge room for both creativity 
and discretion.
</p>
<p>Hence, the question of whether the principal&rsquo;s award should be reduced is left 
quite open in the Act on Compensation for Damage &sect; 5&ndash;1 ( 3 ). The wording of the 
text reads that a judge may reduce an award due to the auxiliary&rsquo;s negligent con-
tribution to the damaging event. In the preparatory works of the Act, reference 
is made to the rules on identification developed in court practice and theory. Ac-
cording to doctrine, the identification on the part of the claimant&rsquo;s side should 
be at least as far-reaching as the identification in cases where the principal is the 
responsible party, typically employers&rsquo; liability ( respondeat superior ). Theorists 
have advocated that the notion of a more far-reaching effect of identification on 
the claimant&rsquo;s side can be justified by looking to the fact that the principal trusted 
the auxiliary with his goods, person or assets177. By doing so, he made a delib-
erate choice to involve the auxiliary at the risk of losing the value of the good 
entrusted178. The consequences of the entrustment are foreseeable. Conversely, 
when a principal chooses an auxiliary for an activity in his interest, the damage 
and the correspondingly financial responsibility for the principal may potentially 
be very high, almost limitless. There is no fixed upper limit as in the situation 
where the principal is the claimant and may have his award reduced due to the 
auxiliary&rsquo;s negligence179. This speaks against a wide identification in a way that is 
not relevant to the victim and his auxiliaries.
</p>
<p>The liability for the negligent acts of another is somewhat broader in Norway 
than seems to be the case in Germany and Austria. An employee is held strictly 
liable for the damage he causes when acting negligently within the scope of em-
ployment. Liability by identification is established regardless of whether there is 
any contract or special relationship between the principal and the victim. Corre-

</p>
<p>spondingly, there is considerable room for reduction on the basis of imputed con-
tributory negligence. Such identification is uncontroversial in cases concerning 
damage to things or pure economic loss180.
</p>
<p>In personal injury cases, however, the room for identification is much nar-
rower. There is a long tradition of not reducing personal injury awards on the ba-
sis of contributory negligence181. The same goes for the question of reducing the 
award to dependents because of the breadwinner&rsquo;s negligent contribution to his 
own death. The reason for this is social considerations182: the lawmaker wants 
to ensure that the plaintiffs are left with sufficient compensation to have a de-
cent standard of living. Of course the social security benefits will secure the basic 
needs of children and supported spouses, but the idea is to make the tortfeasor 
pay on top of the benefits so that the next of kin are provided for as far as possible 
in spite of their relative&rsquo;s contribution to the damage. In the preparatory works it 
is even emphasised that the main rule should be no identification between the de-
pendents and the deceased breadwinner183. As for damage to things, the tendency 
towards the identification solution is stronger. One may say that the main rule is 
the opposite: the negligent conduct of an auxiliary as a general rule motivates re-
duction of the claim. For this kind of damage, the Norwegian stance seems to be 
similar to the Germanic approach: identification as far as the auxiliary has con-
tributed to the damage.
</p>
<p>An interesting point in the outline above is that social considerations seem to 
play a significant part in the application of rules on reduction of damages. Such 
considerations speak against identification that results in a reduction of damages. 
The underlying value is consistent with the values constituting the special system 
of loss coverage associated with &raquo; the Nordic model &laquo;. The orientation is very much 
influenced by ideas of distributive justice. In various contexts a quite pragmatic 
approach is taken: if a type of damage is typically covered by insurance, there is a 
clear willingness to refrain from reduction.184 This attitude is not only a feature of 
Norwegian tort law, but also Swedish law. In fact, Swedish law is even more reluc-
tant than Norwegian law to reduce damages, something that has been highlighted 
in the Norwegian debate on the subject185.

<p>Part 7 Limitation of liability
</p>
<p>I. Introduction
</p>
<p>The Norwegian doctrine of tort law revolves around the causal link between the 
tortfeasor&rsquo;s act and the damage. There is &ndash; as under Germanic law &ndash; a need for 
some kind of limitation of the causal consequences for which the tortfeasor should 
pay damages186. As for the general approach, the equivalence theory and the con-
ditio sine qua non test are the starting point and the first step in a &raquo; bifurcated 
approach &laquo;. The second step is named as &raquo; limitation of causality &laquo; by some schol-
ars, a term resembling that suggested in Basic Questions I187. The second step is, 
however, somewhat confusing because it consists of two separate approaches that 
are sometimes intertwined. The first approach is a test of whether a condition 
that qualifies as a conditio sine qua non is so insignificant that it should not be 
regarded. The other approach is to ask whether a consequence of the damaging 
act is too remote. Both tests occur in the same case, and depending on the con-
crete merits of the case, they sometimes revolve around the same factual events, 
something that leaves an untidy picture. The approaches may be looked upon as 
alternative ways of justifying a limitation of liability based on the causal connec-
tions of the case.
</p>
<p>The Norwegian model of limitation is to set boundaries for liability on a nor-
mative and quite discretionary basis. The adequacy test consists of a set of themes 
that are elaborated from case to case with variable strengths and weights. The 
themes are varied considerations of values, efficiency, and general conceptions of 
how the risk stemming from an act or activity should be divided between the tort-
feasor and the claimant.
</p>
<p>II. The requirements of adequacy
</p>
<p>The rules and principles of Norwegian law regarding adequacy have to some ex-
tent the same content as Austrian law; however, some major aspects are missing or 
are not extensively developed in court practice or the doctrinal literature. Particu-
larly important is that the idea that the protective purpose of the rules set bounda-

</p>
<p>ries for adequate causation is present but not as predominantly as in Germanic 
law188. Also, other continental ideas have only pale or non-existing counterparts in 
the Norwegian doctrine.
</p>
<p>The basic requirements of adequacy are that the damage which occurred was 
foreseeable and that the damage was sufficiently closely connected to the interests 
of the plaintiff189. The latter criterion is most often applied when the damage is 
caused to a third party, such as in cable cases190. In such cases the crucial question 
has been whether the damaged interest of the victim was sufficiently &raquo; concrete 
and close &laquo; to the damaged thing191.
</p>
<p>The boundaries of adequacy are drawn further where the damage is caused 
with intent. This view has had theoretical support in older literature192. Leading 
scholars later argued against it193. In court practice the reasoning is, however, ac-
cepted. Also the presence of gross negligence constitutes a reason for making 
even remote kinds of damage compensable194. When it comes to strict liability, 
there is no clear doctrine of a wider range of adequacy; however, the case in Rt. 
2006, 690 may very well be understood as an indication of such a principle: two 
trains collided and the cargo on one of the trains leaked out, bringing about an 
imminent danger of explosion. Many stores and offices in the adjacent town of 
Lillestr&oslash;m had to close and evacuate for several days. The court emphasised that 
the damage was caused by a typical incident that should be covered by the strict 
liability for railroads and implicitly argued that the responsibility should there-
fore be wide and cover remote effects, such as expenses stemming from the need 
to evacuate due to an impending danger of explosion. The fact that strict liability 
under Norwegian law has developed via a rigid application of the culpa rule may 
possibly justify making the range of adequacy wider in strict liability cases than in 
cases based on culpability.

</p>
<p>III.  Differences between Germanic and Norwegian law 
regarding adequacy
</p>
<p>Under Norwegian law, the protective purpose of the rule is, as mentioned, not 
recognised as a special doctrine of limitation of damages. Of course teleological 
interpretation is a part of the general method of interpretation of statutory provi-
sions, but such interpretation is not very often applied in the field of tort law. The 
profound ideas of the German and Austrian approach are nevertheless from time 
to time present in the wide and somewhat indistinct doctrine of adequacy. The 
idea that the victim must be protected by the rule in question is connected with 
the question of how written rules affect the culpa norm. The prevailing opinion is 
that the written rule only defines the duty of care provided that the rule was made 
to protect the victim195.
</p>
<p>In other cases the purpose of an Act plays a role in the more precise elabora-
tion of where the boundaries of adequacy should be drawn. In Rt. 1992, 453 a case 
on public authority liability for lack of control of imported fish that led to fish dis-
ease and consequential loss to fish farmers, the purpose of the Act on Fish Disease 
Control was brought into the reasoning but not, however, as a decisive point196.
</p>
<p>Because there is no theoretical frame for or no developed doctrine on protec-
tive purpose, elements of the idea will and also will not arise in reasoning con-
cerning adequacy depending on the discretion of the court. This is very much in 
line with the philosophy of leaving much flexibility to the judge. In this way the 
likelihood of reaching sound decisions is good, but there may be a lack of foresee-
ability in the application of adequacy tests, something that has been criticised by 
scholars197.
</p>
<p>The idea of lawful alternative conduct has not been promoted or developed on 
a theoretical level in Norwegian tort law. Some of the examples, such as the exam-
ple of the drunken cyclist ( Basic Questions I, no 7 / 22 ), would probably have been 
solved by using general causal explanations.

</p>
<p>IV.  The problem of disproportionately  
vast damage
</p>
<p>Under Norwegian law, one of the problems connected with adequate causation 
has been the assessment of the impact of disproportionately vast damage which 
has devastating consequences for the tortfeasor who may have limited assets to 
pay damages. In earlier times this was addressed under the label of adequacy, 
most clearly in an obiter dictum in Rt. 1955, 1132. The case concerned a bet placed 
with a bookmaker who failed to send in the coupon, and therefore deprived the 
man who had bet of a gain that he would have made had the bookmaker acted pru-
dently. The gain was modest, approx NOK 3,000 ( &euro; 360 ), and the court stated that 
they might have reasoned otherwise had a larger sum of money been concerned, 
thereby implicitly suggesting a limitation based on adequacy.
</p>
<p>A consistent approach was taken by the Supreme Court in the famous cable 
case in Rt. 1973, 1268, where an airplane crashed into electricity cables, leaving 
a large number of electricity users with no electricity. The claimant was a fish 
farmer, who due to the lack of electricity suffered a loss stemming from the fact 
that a large number of ( baby ) fish died because the water was not sufficiently hot. 
In the action against the owner of the airplane, the state, the Supreme Court found 
that the risk of being ruined by a floodgate of claims in cable cases should speak 
for limiting the circle of compensable consequences. This was one of a few argu-
ments that supported the decision not to pay compensation to the fish farmer.
</p>
<p>Later, a debate arose about whether the limitation due to large claims is still 
valid since a general reduction clause was enacted in Norwegian law. Some schol-
ars maintain that the reasoning in the 1973 case is no longer valid198. Others hold 
the opinion that the flexible borderline of adequacy stands on its own, and that 
the limitation cannot be changed by the fact that other rules touch upon the same 
elements199. This debate will be elaborated upon below, in connection with the de-
scription of the application of the reduction clause.

<p>Part 8 The compensation of the damage
</p>
<p>I. The idea of &raquo; compensation in full &laquo;
</p>
<p>Norwegian law recognises a rule of &raquo; compensation in full &laquo; for damage. The rule is 
general and uncodified save for some sectoral provisions200. Even the sectoral pro-
visions must be interpreted in the light of the general rule of full compensation.
</p>
<p>The idea of making the amount of compensation dependent on the degree of 
fault was put forward early in the 20 th century in profound theoretical works201. The 
idea was, however, rejected by leading scholars202. Ever since, Norwegian doctrine 
has been built upon a clear precondition of full compensation as the main rule.
</p>
<p>As for damage to things and for pure economic loss, this rule may be inter-
preted literally, comprising &raquo; damnum emergens &laquo; and &raquo; lucrum cessans &laquo;. However, 
when it comes to the assessment of damages and personal injury awards, the rule 
is interpreted in a rather reductive way. Thus, the courts have presented interpre-
tations which include other aspects such as that only expenses that are &raquo; reason-
able and necessary &laquo; ( &raquo; rimelig og n&oslash;dvendig &laquo; ) are to be recovered203. Furthermore, 
a victim who is severely injured and must henceforth use a wheelchair should be 
able to live a life &raquo; as fulfilling as possible &laquo; ( &raquo; s&aring; fullverdig liv som det er mulig &laquo; )204. 
Hence normative components are at play when courts decide the award. An under-
lying truth is that it is immensely costly to compensate an injured person so that 
he or she may have a life even slightly resembling life before the accident. There-
fore the rule of &raquo; full compensation &laquo; must be interpreted in a manner that repre-
sents a feasible compromise between the tortfeasor ( and the liability insurance 
industry ) on the one hand and the victim on the other.

<p>The latter paired the idea with an idea of proportional liability applicable for situations compris-

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>II. Lump sum is the main rule
</p>
<p>The main rule is that compensation should be awarded in a lump sum205. The rea-
son for this is the general purpose of closing the case, so that the parties can move 
on206. Only where special circumstances ( &raquo; s&aelig;rlige grunner &laquo; ) are present, may the 
judge award a periodic sum. This is particularly a good option where the victim 
suffers from life threatening damage. The option of periodical damages means 
that the tortfeasor will not have to pay damages for a period longer than the victim 
will actually live207. The rule under Norwegian law is that the loss of income after 
the victim is dead should not be compensated, even if the responsible tortfeasor 
is the cause of death208.
</p>
<p>The one time lump-sum solution may be challenged by rational arguments 
pointing to the fact that the assessment of damages may be quite inaccurate if, 
for example, the victim dies shortly after a conclusive settlement. The Norwegian 
tradition of compensation in a lump sum is, however, strong on this point. When-
ever the question has been discussed in the preparatory works, the counter argu-
ments have been varied and perceived as more convincing. Such arguments have 
been that it might be difficult to secure the value of the compensation through 
the shifting value of the national currency and that paying by annuity may pro-
duce administrative costs that otherwise could have been avoided209. In addition, 
the more obvious argument that the tortfeasor may be dead or insolvent at a later 
stage has of course been put forward. Looking back on the previous discussions, 
some of the arguments against the periodical solution do not seem strong in mod-
ern times. It is a fact that most damages for personal injury are covered by insur-
ance companies. These institutions have the means and ability to buy annuity 
payments from a financial institution. Such a system is well developed in Sweden, 
a country in which periodical payments are the main solution in personal injury 
cases. Furthermore, the question of securing the value of the payment may nowa-
days be solved by applying the widely used monetary unit of G210. The amount of

on standardised personal injury awards, see NOU 2011: 16.

</p>
<p>the monetary unit of G is decided every year in the light of the level of wages and 
prices in Norway.
</p>
<p>In 2011 a new draft on standardised personal injury awards was drawn up211. 
The committee had a good opportunity to discuss an annuity solution. Even 
though, as mentioned above, there may be good arguments for choosing the an-
nuity solutions, the committee chose to keep the established rule on lump-sum 
payments. An important reason for this choice was the fact that the lump-sum 
system corresponds with the idea of standardisation. As long as the injury awards 
follow from fixed figures of G in tables of compensation, the logical fulfilment of 
the system is that the tortfeasor pays the damages once and for all212.
</p>
<p>It also played a part that the committee in its mandate was encouraged to use 
the Danish personal injury system &ndash; featuring lump-sum solutions &ndash; as a model213. 
Moreover, the fact that the victim ( and accordingly the tortfeasor &ndash; by compensat-
ing the victim&rsquo;s expenses ) has to pay tax on compensation once it is paid as an 
annuity was a weighty argument for choosing the lump-sum payment. All in all, 
given the context of standardisation, it was the best solution for the committee to 
choose the lump-sum solution.
</p>
<p>III. The reduction of the duty to compensate
</p>
<p>Under Norwegian law there is a reduction clause covering all delict cases, see the 
Norwegian Compensatory Damages Act ( NCA ) &sect; 5&ndash;2. The provision states broadly 
that in any case where the burden of covering the loss of the plaintiff is &raquo; unreason-
able &laquo;, the award should be reduced accordingly.
</p>
<p>The main purpose of the rule seems to be a way of having an escape clause for 
the tortfeasor under very special circumstances. The preparatory works mention 
that the concern for the tortfeasor was the most important motivation for the rule. 
The preparatory works also focused on the fact that there were reduction clauses 
in other parts of the tort law area. One should therefore design a general reduction 
clause in order to secure consistency of law214.
</p>
<p>As for the other legislative reasons for the reduction clause, they are differ-
ent from and more pragmatically oriented than the reasons put forward by Ca-
naris and Bydlinski215. The reasoning based on the grounds of social justice seems

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>to have a sort of equivalent set of thoughts in the Norwegian reasoning liability  
( Bydlinski ) in the preparatory works, case law and theoretical comments. On sev-
eral occasions reference is made to the fact that the reduction is less justified 
where there is insurance or a possibility of insurance on the defendant&rsquo;s side216. 
Whenever the tortfeasor is insured, the burden is hardly &raquo; unreasonable &laquo; for the 
defendant. The idea of reduction is mainly related to situations where there is a 
defendant who is personally responsible and who has to cover the loss by spending 
his or her own assets. However, the second sentence in the provision allows for a 
reduction even if the burden is not unreasonable. Instead reduction may be based 
on the fact that it is reasonable that the claimant covers parts of the loss. In such 
cases the reduction clause may also benefit the insurance companies217. There are 
no traces of constitutional principles or principles related to abuse of rights in the 
history of the Norwegian reduction clause. The discussion on whether the execu-
tion and enforcement rules may substitute or make the reduction clause obsolete 
has also not emerged in Norwegian doctrine.
</p>
<p>The statutory provision skl. &sect; 5&ndash;2 contains guidelines for the process of re-
duction. One should attach weight to the financial status of the tortfeasor, the de-
gree or severity of the fault and other circumstances. This is one of the very few 
places in the tort law system that recognises the financial status of the tortfeasor 
as a relevant factor. In most contexts there is a clear perception that the financial 
status is irrelevant, hereunder also the question of whether there is in fact any in-
surance involved218. The provision opens up a wide margin of discretion. In the 
preparatory works for the reduction clause, which was enacted in 1985, there are 
indications that the provision is to be applied only in very exceptional cases. The 
Supreme Court has, however, reduced the award on a number of occasions. The 
most far-reaching decisions seem to be cases where the tortfeasor acted with in-
tent and even with criminal intent. In Rt. 2004, 165 a young man who had no finan-
cial assets set fire to a home for elderly people. He acted with intent, but the court 
noted that at the time he was under the influence of drugs. The award was reduced 
by 50 %. There are also other cases where comparable judgments were given219. 
There are, however, limits to the court&rsquo;s willingness to reduce. Where the gravity 
of the act is sufficient, it will not matter whether the tortfeasor is without assets. 
In cases of robbery and a bomb attack, both involving killing or attempting to kill 
people, the Supreme Court has found that reduction was out of the question220.

<p>As mentioned above, there is, however, another ongoing debate, connected to 
the limits of adequate cause. This has partly historical reasons: before the general 
reduction clause was enacted in 1985, the case law suggested that the rule of ad-
equacy might be a salvation for the defendant facing a ruinous claim221. The argu-
ment of the otherwise ruinous consequences thus was a crucial argument in the 
famous and important case of liability for third party interests in Rt. 1973, 1268: 
a plane flew into an electric cable, causing damage to a fish farm which needed 
the electricity to heat the water for fish. The fish died and the fish farmer claimed 
compensation from the owner of the plane, the national Ministry of Defence. The 
defendant was not held liable partly because of the consequences for defendants 
who potentially might cause damage to a plurality of third parties, such as typ-
ically in cable cases where a large number of electricity users may be involved. 
Scholars have suggested that the enactment of the reduction clause put an end 
to this case law, so that the argument of ruinous consequences was no longer rel-
evant to the question of adequacy222. This is a stance that very much resembles the 
recommendation made in Basic Questions I in connection with limits of liabil-
ity223. Askeland has opposed this view, holding that the argument of ruinous conse-
quences may still be of importance when drawing the limits of adequacy  224. In Rt. 
2003, 338 no 76, the Supreme Court implicitly accepted that a huge loss stemming 
from a minor accident may lead to limitation of liability based on lack of foresee-
ability. In another case Rt. 2006, 690 mentioned above in no 2 / 130, the Supreme 
Court stated that the ruinous consequences argument might be relevant to the ad-
equacy test; however, it did not apply the argument in the case at hand225.
</p>
<p>The crucial question on this point is whether the fact that the economic con-
sequences of the tortious act were unforeseeably huge is a decisive point for the 
test of adequacy. The adequacy test will often refer to the foreseeable physical con-
sequences of an act regardless of the economic consequences. The old example 
of von Tuhr ( the horse driver falls asleep, the horse changes direction and the car-
riage is struck by lightning ), which has played a part in the doctrine both in cen-
tral Europe and in Norway, is an example of physical consequences. Still, as long 
as the floodgate argument is conceived to be relevant under the question of limi-
tation of causation, one can in my opinion not distinguish between arguments of 
such limitation and arguments built upon the size of the award. As long as these 
arguments have been relevant to the doctrine and court practice, the rules and the 
system will change once the argument of huge awards is transferred to the ques-

<p>tion of reduction. One must bear in mind that the question of reduction chrono-
logically emerges only after the question of adequacy is decided. If the argument 
of the huge award is transferred to the reduction question, more cases than previ-
ously will pass the limitation of causation test. Furthermore, in situations where 
paying the damages is burdensome because there are many claimants, it would be 
a strange and costly system to allow many claimants to sue and win, and thereafter 
reduce the damages to a very little sum because it would be too burdensome for 
the defendant to pay in full to all claimants226.
</p>
<p>The court practice mentioned above indicates that the reduction clause in 
Norwegian law is somewhat wider than its European counterparts, and also wider 
than the reduction clause in soft law regimes, see PEL Liab Dam art 6 : 202 and 
PETL 10 : 401227. It is a rule of adequacy that leaves much discretion to judges. It 
may not be recommendable to transfer more cases to be decided under the wide 
discretion clause in skl. &sect; 5&ndash;2. It would also leave some doubt about the weight 
of the floodgate argument. In my opinion, the best way forward would be to con-
tinue observing the case law as developed before the reduction clause was enacted 
in 1985. In any event, the self-contradicting practice of the Supreme Court on this 
point is not satisfactory.

<p>Part 9 Prescription of compensation claims
</p>
<p>The Norwegian system of prescription rules resembles Germanic solutions, none-
theless with some differences regarding the time periods and the commence-
ment of the periods. The legislative reasons for the limitation periods are the well-
known viewpoints on the possibility of proving the facts of the case, but also the 
need for the defendant to move on without risking being sued for acts or activities 
that he was involved in a long time before the claim. A claim in torts is prescribed 
three years after the point in time when the claimant was aware of or ought to 
have been aware of the damage and the responsible party, see Foreldelsesloven 
1979 ( &raquo; Limitation Act &laquo; ) &sect; 9. The rule thus resembles the German rule on the short 
period, but however with a difference in commencement date. The German rule, 
where the time period commences at the end of the year when sufficient knowl-
edge of the claim and the defendant is achieved, is however chosen in the Act on 
Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation228.
</p>
<p>The most doubtful question in this area of law has been to decide when the 
victim had sufficient information to sue the tortfeasor. A string of cases shows that 
the question is governed by a rule that resembles the culpa norm229. This is natu-
ral since the main requisite for prescription is that the claimant ought to have the 
knowledge sufficient for a lawsuit230.
</p>
<p>As for the long prescription period, it is 20 years, commencing from the end 
of the damaging act. In principle the commencement may be prior to the occur-
rence of the damage. This is a solution that seems to have no counterpart in the 
Germanic rules on prescription. The rule is, however, well founded, especially in 
cases where the damaging act lasts for a long time, such as in the case of emis-
sions and other continuous damaging activities.
</p>
<p>There is, however, an exception for personal injuries that are sustained by 
a person under 18 years of age and where the tortfeasor knew or ought to have 
known that the activity might lead to personal injury. Claims based on injuries 
under such circumstances will never prescribe. The exception was included in the 
relevant Act in the nineties as a response to cases of sexual abuse of children, who 
dared not or, for other reasons, could not file a lawsuit within ordinary time limits. 
Such victims may often have problems that make it difficult for them to sue before

<p>they become adults. A 20-year long stop rule might otherwise prevent these vic-
tims from claiming their rights.
</p>
<p>The limitation rules referred to apply only to non-contractual liability, how-
ever with an exemption for personal injuries occurring in connection with the per-
formance of a contract: see skl. &sect; 9, third section.
</p>
<p>The idea of reversing the burden of proof after half of the prescription period 
seems to be a progressive and interesting solution. It has, however, never been 
aired in the Norwegian debate. The relatively short period of three years may not 
invite the solution in the same way as the longer period in Austrian law does.

a Polish Perspective

</p>
<p>Part 1  Introduction
</p>
<p>Although the rule of &raquo; casum sentit dominus &laquo;  is not expressed in any of the provi-
sions of the Civil Code ( kodeks cywilny; hereinafter KC )1, its significance as a prin-
ciple underlying Polish tort law cannot be questioned. It stands without doubt 
that losses can be passed on to persons other than the victim only if particular rea-
sons exist that justify such a transfer.
</p>
<p>As in many other European countries, a tendency has been noted in Poland 
over the last decades to strengthen the protection of tort victims2; one could say 
that there has been an increase in the number of reasons recognised as justifying 
the shifting of damage to persons other than the one who sustained it as well as a 
trend towards acknowledging reasons already accepted as such in areas in which 
they did not hitherto play a role. Several examples will be drawn on to illustrate 
this tendency. One of them is the growing significance of responsibility independ-
ent of fault, which has recently been introduced in the field of liability for the ex-
ercise of public authority ( art 417 ff KC; see no 3 / 96 below ) as well as in the area of 
product liability ( art 449 1 ff KC ). A trend towards objectivising fault-based liability 
may also be discerned: there is, for example, a tendency to assume the liability 
of a legal entity for the acts of its organs ( art 416 KC ) based only on the unlawful-
ness of conduct, passing over the issue of individual accusations directed against

<p>organ members3; the concept of &raquo; anonymous fault &laquo; is used in cases of damage 
infliction by one or more of a group of persons to whom the same liability rule 
applies, which means that the individual characteristics of the actual perpetrator 
are ignored4. The notion of a delict has been stretched to include violations of de-
ontological norms, and tortious liability may also be triggered by the provision of 
untrue information5. In the early 1990s art 446 1 was introduced into the Civil Code, 
explicitly allowing a child to demand the redress of damage that it suffered before 
being born, and in recent years Polish case law has developed rules on liability for 
both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by unwanted birth ( see no 3 / 75 
f below ). Since 2008 the closest family members of a deceased tort victim may 
claim compensation for moral harm ( art 446 &sect; 4 KC )6.
</p>
<p>The following contribution is concerned solely with tort law; other schemes 
allowing for the shifting of damage, such as social security law or insurance law, 
are only mentioned insofar as necessary to show the place of the law of delict 
within the Polish legal system. Tortious liability is also set against the background 
of instruments which, unlike tort law, are not aimed at compensating the injured 
party, but which likewise serve the protection of rights and interests.
</p>
<p>The idea of replacing certain areas of liability law, and more specifically traf-
fic and medical liability, with insurance-based solutions7, or of supplementing 
the law of damages with such solutions, has been considered in Poland8, but 
has not met with much approval in areas other than medical treatment. As re-
cently as 20119, a new extra-judicial compensation system for victims of medical

<p>167Part 1&emsp; &emsp; Introduction
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>injuries was introduced10, which, although inspired by no-fault patient insurance 
schemes11, cannot itself be regarded as such due to the fact that it only provides 
compensation if an infection, bodily injury, health disorder or death of a patient 
resulted from an event  inconsistent  with  current  medical  knowledge  ( a so-called 
&raquo; medical event &laquo; )12, which implies negligence13. Also, the new system does not de-
prive the injured party of the possibility to take action in tort: the patient is al-
lowed to choose whether to make use of the out-of-court scheme or to follow the 
path of the law of damages14. And finally, medical event insurance, constituting 
an essential element of the system and designed as compulsory, was temporarily 
made non-compulsory15 due to problems with the execution of the obligation to 
insure; therefore in the end, at least for the time being, the scheme cannot be de-
scribed as &raquo; insurance-based &laquo;.
</p>
<p>As Koziol indicates, the borders between tort law and its &raquo; neighbouring fields &laquo; 
may be somewhat blurred16; there should, however, be no doubt that this should 
not lead to, and cannot justify, implanting into the law of delict concepts that 
cannot be reconciled with its fundamental aims, such as punitive damages ( see 
no 3 / 33 below ).
</p>
<p>A good example of &raquo; blurred boundaries &laquo; is the division between a claim for 
the restoration of a lawful position and a claim for compensation by means of 
natural restitution ( see the remarks on actio negatoria at no 3 / 21 f below ). In such 
cases, as Koziol points out, it would be sensible to allow for a &raquo; fluid transition &laquo; be-
tween the two areas in question rather than keep to sharp distinctions17 ( ie in the 
case of actio negatoria give up adhering to one set of prerequisites and one set of 
consequences and allow for their differentiation18 ). No such tendency can, how-
ever, be discerned in Polish law. Instead, the focus is on the distinction between 
the two claims and attention is paid to aligning the extent of restoration of a lawful

<p>position to the prerequisites of actio negatoria, which are more lenient than those 
of a tortious claim.
</p>
<p>Koziol&rsquo;s support of fluid transitions manifests itself very clearly in the area of 
alternative causation between an incident which generates liability and a chance, 
where he strongly criticises the all-or-nothing principle and supports the idea of 
liability apportionment19. Polish tort law does not, however, recognise poten-
tial causation, which speaks against adopting such a solution in these cases ( see 
no 3 / 85 below ).
</p>
<p>Although in essence not a question of blurred boundaries20, tort law&rsquo;s interac-
tion with the law of unjust enrichment is nevertheless very interesting. The fact 
that the tortfeasor gained an advantage from his tort is irrelevant for the extent of 
the duty to compensate ( in the sense that it cannot lead to compensation exceed-
ing the damage suffered ), which may be considered problematic when in a given 
case the victim does not have an unjust enrichment claim at his disposal ( see 
no 3 / 27 below )21. On the other hand, the enriched person&rsquo;s obligation to reckon 
with the duty to return the advantage, assessed according to an objective yardstick, 
results in the existence of such a duty even if the person is no longer enriched ( see 
no 3 / 24 below ). It may therefore be said that the enriched person&rsquo;s conduct leads 
to him having to bear the burden of the impoverished person&rsquo;s loss22.
</p>
<p>Polish law clearly distinguishes between tort law and breaches of contract and 
does not formally recognise any interim area, which means that each case is allo-
cated either to the field of contract, or to the realm of tort, or to both with a right 
to choose the liability regime, but not &raquo; in between &laquo;. It should, however, be briefly 
noted here that a view has been expressed which considers liability for culpa in 
contrahendo as a special regime, separate from both tort and contract ( see espe-
cially nos 3 / 52 and 3 / 60 below ).
</p>
<p>It seems correct to speak of a dual-lane structure of Polish tort law23 in that 
two main liability grounds are distinguished: fault-based and strict liability24. That 
said, it must be noted that a certain approximation may be discerned between 
fault and non-fault based liability due to the objectivisation of fault ( see no 3 / 119 
below ). Also, neither fault-based nor strict liability is a uniform area. Within the 
latter, different levels of strictness can be discerned25, while within the former the

<p>standard of care varies depending on the type of relations in question ( art 355 &sect; 1 
KC ) and is more stringent if the perpetrator acts as a professional ( art 355 &sect; 2 KC ); 
also, the reversal of the burden of proof of fault ( arts 427, 429, 431 KC ) makes fault-
based liability stricter; and finally, the term &raquo; fault &laquo; may be ascribed more than one 
meaning ( see the remarks on the understanding of &raquo; fault in selection &laquo; at no 3 / 123 
below ).
</p>
<p>Wilburg&rsquo;s flexible system, considered and advocated by Koziol in &raquo; Basic Ques-
tions of Tort Law from a Germanic Perspective &laquo;, is not known to Polish tort law, 
which at its core adheres to clear-cut rules, supplemented by general clauses al-
lowing for a certain amount of discretion. In order for delictual liability to arise, 
all its prerequisites must be fulfilled; responsibility cannot therefore be affirmed 
if one of the conditions for liability is not satisfied, even if the weight of other fac-
tors exceeds what is usually required. And while it is true that the flexible system, 
with its support for fluid transitions and rejection of abrupt either-or solutions, 
offers sensible answers to numerous complex problems and is capable of &raquo; encom-
passing all imaginable cases and their special qualities &laquo;26, it is also rather compli-
cated, which means that its adoption would place the bar very high for all those 
involved in the process of law application. If even the comparably &raquo; hard and fast &laquo; 
rules of the present system cause many problems and leave countless questions 
open, one can only imagine how difficult and demanding it would be to apply a 
scheme whose very essence is flexibility.
</p>
<p>The following report looks at the basic questions of tort law from the point of 
view of the Polish legal system. In order to accentuate similarities and differences, 
references are made to solutions adopted or proposed in the Germanic jurisdic-
tions as presented in H. Koziol&rsquo;s book &raquo; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Ger-
manic Perspective &laquo;, which forms a basis for this contribution with regard to both 
structure and content.

<p> Part 2  The law of damages within the system for the 
protection of rights and legal interests
</p>
<p>I. In general
</p>
<p>A claim for damages offers far-reaching protection of rights and interests, but is 
also subject to strict requirements. A mere interference with protected interests 
is not enough to justify such a claim; further conditions must be fulfilled, such as 
unlawfulness and fault, or risk posed by a particular activity27. The law of damages 
is, however, only one of the remedies provided by the legal system to serve the 
protection of rights and interests. The following chapter looks at other available 
instruments and at their interplay with the law of damages.
</p>
<p>II. Claims for recovery
</p>
<p>As in German and Austrian law, rei vindicatio ( art 222 &sect; 1 KC ) merely requires that 
the claimant ( owner ) is entitled to possess a thing ( or, to be more precise, to hold 
actual control over it ) while the defendant is not, and is directed at the surrender 
and recovery of the thing in the condition it is found at the time of the claim28. 
Since compensation in kind is available to the victim under art 363 &sect; 1 KC, the re-
covery of a thing may also be effected under the stricter requirements of the law of 
damages. Under these more stringent conditions the claimant may, however, not 
only retrieve the thing as it is, but also demand the redress of consequential harm 
caused by the loss of possession.
</p>
<p>Polish law also takes care of the owner&rsquo;s interests by equipping him with so-
called &raquo; supplementary claims &laquo; against the unauthorised possessor ( ie a claim for 
the remuneration for using a thing, a claim for compensation for wear and tear, 
deterioration or loss of a thing, and a claim for profits or for the value of con-
sumed profits; arts 224 f KC ), but these claims, unlike rei vindicatio, are not objec-
tive in nature, that is they depend on the bad or good faith of the possessor, and to 
a certain extent also on fault on his part29.
</p>
<p>27 These are dealt with in detail below.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>The supplementary claims regulated in arts 224 f are regarded as  leges spe-
ciales in relation to the general rules on tortious liability and unjust enrichment30.
</p>
<p>III. Preventive injunctions
</p>
<p>There are several provisions regulating preventive injunctions in Polish private 
law. Apart from the general rule of art 439 KC, which is dealt with under no 3 / 18 be-
low, the following provisions, which introduce injunctions that are more limited in 
scope, must be mentioned: art 24 &sect; 1 KC, which concerns actions endangering per-
sonality rights31; art 78 of the Copyright Act32, dealing with actions threatening au-
thors&rsquo; personal rights; art 285 of the Industrial Property Law33, which regulates, inter 
alia, actions endangering patent rights; art 18 s 1 of Unfair Competition Act34, con-
cerning the endangerment of an entrepreneur&rsquo;s interest by an act of unfair compe-
tition. These &raquo; limited &laquo; injunctions do not form a consistent system, which fact has 
thwarted attempts to reconstruct any general rules common to all of them35. It may, 
however, be noted that, like in the Germanic legal systems, fault is not considered 
</p>
<p>possessor in bad faith must provide remuneration for the use of a thing and is responsible 
for its wear and tear, deterioration or loss, unless the deterioration or loss would also have en-
sued if the thing had been in possession of the entitled person ( he / she is therefore liable for 
casus mixtus, so his / her liability is stricter than traditional fault-based tortious liability ); he is 
also obliged to return the collected profits that he / she did not consume and to pay the value 
of profits he consumed, as well as to return the value of profits which he / she failed to obtain 
due to bad management. Special rules apply to the possessor in good faith from the moment 
he / she learned about the action for the recovery of the thing being brought against him / her: 
he / she is obliged to return the collected profits that he / she did not consume and to pay the 
value of profits consumed as well as to pay remuneration for the use of the thing. He / she is 
also responsible for the wear and tear as well as for the thing&rsquo;s deterioration or loss, unless 
the deterioration or loss happened without his / her fault ( his / her liability is therefore based 
on presumed fault ).

and the literature cited therein.
</p>
<p>31 To be precise, art 24 concerns actions endangering dobra osobiste, which translate more closely 
as &raquo; personal interests &laquo;. &raquo; Dobra osobiste &laquo; are defined as values recognised by society, covering 
a person&rsquo;s physical and mental integrity, individuality, dignity as well as his / her position in 
society, and being a prerequisite for the person&rsquo;s self-realisation; see Z. Radwański, Prawo cy-
wilne &ndash; część og&oacute;lna ( 2005 ) 160 f. In this report &raquo; dobra osobiste &laquo; are referred to as personality 
rights &ndash; a term which seems to work better in a comparative context.

</p>
<p>a prerequisite for the entitlement to such injunctions; unlawful endangerment is in 
principle sufficient. Unlawfulness of actions endangering personality rights is pre-
sumed36 and understood broadly37, that is as an infringement of a legal provision or the 
&raquo; principles of community  life &laquo;38. The prerequisite for a preventive injunction based 
on art 18 of the Unfair Competition Act is the commission of an act of unfair com-
petition, that is an act contrary to law or bonos mores which endangers or infringes 
the interests of another entrepreneur ( art 3 of the Act ). As for art 285 of the Indus-
trial Property Law, it is emphasised that the claimant should prove that the defend-
ant undertook actions &raquo; threatening to infringe a specific industrial property right &laquo;39.
</p>
<p>A general provision regulating preventive injunctions is art 439 KC, which 
states that &raquo; a person who is directly exposed to the risk of damage resulting from 
the behaviour of another person, in particular due to lack of proper supervision of 
the operation of an enterprise or business controlled by him, or of the condition 
of a building or any other installation possessed by him, may demand that that 
person undertakes any measures necessary to avert the immediate danger, and, if 
necessary, also to give adequate security &laquo;40. In contrast to the aforementioned reg-
ulations ( see no 3 / 17 ), art 439 KC, which is rarely applied in practice41, is broader 
in scope in that it not only encompasses preventive injunctions, but also allows 
for claims for positive actions aimed at warding off the peril; indeed, the former, 
which are being considered here, are deemed to come into question less often42. 
There are several theories as to the requirements of a preventive claim based on 
art 439 KC: 1 ) It is enough that there is a causal connection between the threaten-
ing behaviour and the direct threat of damage; the behaviour does not need to be 
unlawful ( this view is chronogically the oldest and no longer represented ); 2 ) the 
threatening behaviour must be faulty ( this theory is criticised for transferring a 
rule typical for liability for damages to an institution not aimed at ensuring com-
pensation but at preventing harm from happening43 ); 3 ) the requirements of a pre-
ventive injunction depend on the basis of liability which would arise in the case of 
damage infliction; 4 ) the threatening behaviour must be unlawful44.

<p>IV. Rights to self-defence
</p>
<p>A person who acts in self-defence against a direct and unlawful attack at his own 
interest or at the interest of another person, is not liable for damage caused to the 
attacker ( art 423 KC ). The value of the interest against which the attack is directed 
is irrelevant45. In order for liability to be excluded, it must be necessary to repel an 
unlawful attack and at the same time not possible to do it in a way less detrimental to 
the legally protected interests of the attacker46. The perpetrator is not obliged to re-
pair damage caused to the attacker if the means used by him / her were appropriate 
in the situation in question, given the purpose of their use ( countering an unlaw-
ful attack ). The unlawfulness of the attack is to be understood broadly, that is as 
an infringement of the law or of the principles of community life47.
</p>
<p>V.  Reparative injunctions
</p>
<p>Article 222 &sect; 2 KC, which regulates actio negatoria, states that an owner is entitled 
to demand  the  restoration of a  lawful position as well as the  cessation of  infringe-
ments  from the person who infringes ownership in a manner other than by de-
priving the owner of actual control over the thing. The claim has a purely objec-
tive character, meaning that it does not depend on any subjective elements such 
as fault or good / bad faith. Its sole prerequisite is the infringement of ownership. In 
order to justify actio negatoria, the infringement must be unlawful, but since the 
right of ownership is very broad in scope, it is safe to say that practically all inter-
ferences with the owner&rsquo;s sphere of control over a thing are unlawful, unless they 
are justified by a legal provision48.
</p>
<p>The difference in wording between art 222 &sect; 2 KC and art 363 &sect; 1 KC is a clear 
indicator that the Polish legislator distinguishes between restoring a lawful posi-
tion and restoring  the previous position under art 363 KC, which deals with com-
pensation of damage ( see no 3 / 160 below )49. It is, however, not entirely clear where 
exactly the border should be drawn between actio negatoria and a claim for com-
pensation. Dybowski stresses that the former is directed against current unlawful

<p>interferences in another&rsquo;s sphere, while the target of compensation claims is al-
ready inflicted damage, which may result from such unlawful interference, but is 
not a necessary consequence thereof50. There is generally no doubt as to the fact 
that actio negatoria does not encompass a claim for monetary reparation, espe-
cially not for lucrum cessans51. A view has been expressed that &raquo; restoring a lawful 
position &laquo; means not only ceasing the interference with another&rsquo;s property, but 
also removing the effects of such interference ( eg evening out an unlawfully dug 
ditch, removing an unlawfully constructed fence )52. Adoption of this view makes 
it necessary to determine how far a claim for positive action can stretch. It seems 
reasonable that actio negatoria, whose prerequisites are more lenient than those 
of a claim for compensation, should not reach as far as the latter; in other words, 
the owner should not be able to demand natural restitution to the extent that 
the injured party is entitled to require it under art 363 KC. Dybowski convincingly 
argues that the owner can solely demand that the interferer withdraws from the 
boundaries of his / her ownership and takes only such actions as are necessary 
to effect the withdrawal ( ie actions necessary to restore the owner&rsquo;s undisturbed 
control of his / her thing )53; these actions may sometimes converge to a certain ex-
tent with actions aimed at restoring the previous state of affairs54. Anything above 
and beyond can be claimed under the provisions of the law of obligations, pro-
vided that all prerequisites of liability are fulfilled.
</p>
<p>It follows from the above that the claim for restoration of a lawful position 
based on art 222 &sect; 2 KC is regarded as a uniform claim under Polish law; a differ-
entiation of its prerequisites depending on the consequences for the disturber 
( ie whether he / she is only obliged to tolerate the removal or also to actively re-
move the disturbance ), although undoubtedly sensible55, has not hitherto been 
put forward. De lege lata splitting the claim for restoring a lawful position into two 
separate claims ( a claim for non-facere and pati on the one hand and a claim for 
positive action to remove the disturbance on the other ) with different grounds for 
imputation does not seem possible.
</p>
<p>Other examples of reparative injunctions are provided by art 24 &sect; 1 KC ( claim 
for the cessation of an action infringing a personality right as well as for the re-
moval of the consequences of the infringement ), art 78 of the Copyright Act ( claim 
for the cessation of an action infringing an author&rsquo;s personal right as well as for

</p>
<p>VI. Unjust enrichment by interference
</p>
<p>A.  The relationship between claims for unjust enrichment and 
claims for damages
</p>
<p>As pointed out by Koziol, claims for damages and unjust enrichment claims are 
similar in that they both require an interference with the protected interests of an-
other person57, but differ from one another as far as their goals and prerequisites 
are concerned. This is true also in Polish law. An unjust enrichment claim ( art 405 
ff KC ) does not require fault or any other imputation ground typical for tortious 
liability. It is triggered by the enrichment of one person at the expense of another 
( thus impoverished ) person58. The behaviour of the liable party is generally irrel-
evant for the existence of a duty to return the advantage, although there is an ex-
ception to this rule: if the enriched person should have taken into account the duty 
to return while consuming the advantage or disposing of it, he / she is still obliged to 
return even if he / she is no longer enriched ( art 409 KC ). It is indicated that when 
assessing whether the enriched party was obliged to reckon with the duty to re-

</p>
<p>turn, an objective yardstick should be applied59. Czach&oacute;rski points out that since 
there is no mention of fault in art 409, resorting to this term would not be justi-
fied60, although one cannot help but make an association with a divergence from 
the pattern of careful conduct and hence with negligence.
</p>
<p>Polish legal writers define impoverishment as a disadvantage relating to prop-
erty61 and Pietrzykowski emphasises its likeness to pecuniary damage62. The claim 
based on art 405 KC is, however, not aimed at compensating damage, but at dis-
gorging advantage gained by the interferer, so it does not arise if there is no enrich-
ment63. Accordingly, in the case of loss of profits, a claim for disgorgement is only 
justified if the profit went to the interferer; it is not enough that it was lost by the 
impoverished party64.
</p>
<p>In situations where the prerequisites for both claims are met, the disadvan-
taged party may choose whether to pursue a claim in tort or an unjustified enrich-
ment claim ( art 414 KC: &raquo; The provisions of the present title shall not prejudice the 
provisions on the duty to redress damage &laquo; )65.
</p>
<p>It is stressed that the impoverishment and the enrichment must have a joint 
source, meaning that the same event must be both a necessary and a sufficient 
cause of both the former and the latter66. A destruction of machines such as in 
one of the examples provided by Koziol67 does not fulfil this prerequisite. It con-
stitutes the impoverishment, but in order for the other party to become enriched, 
it is necessary for other conditions to be fulfilled68 ( eg customers must turn to 
him rather than, for instance, give up acquiring goods produced by both compe-
titors ). The same can be said about causing a competitor&rsquo;s incapacity to work. The 
law of unjust enrichment is therefore inapplicable in these cases. The law of tort,

<p>tortfeasor exceeds the amount of damage, he / she is left with a profit even after 
compensating the victim in full.
</p>
<p>B.  Approaches to solutions in intellectual property law
</p>
<p>Both the Polish Industrial Property Law and the Copyright Act provide for a claim 
for disgorgement of profit. Art 287 of the former states that a patent holder whose 
patent has been infringed shall be entitled to demand that the interferer returns 
unjustly obtained profits and, in the case of a culpable infringement, makes good 
the damage inflicted either in accordance with the general principles, or through 
the payment of an appropriate sum of money corresponding to the license fee or 
other appropriate remuneration due to the patent holder. A claim for disgorge-
ment of profit, which is independent of the interferer&rsquo;s fault, can therefore be cu-
mulated with a claim for damages, which requires the tortfeasor&rsquo;s fault and which, 
depending on the victim&rsquo;s preference, is either subject to the general principles of 
the Civil Code, or takes on the form of a &raquo; claim for use &laquo;. This solution is therefore 
quite different from that provided by the Austrian Patent Act70.
</p>
<p>Article 79 of the Polish Copyright Act similarly entitles the victim to seek dis-
gorgement of profit obtained by the interferer irrespective of the latter&rsquo;s fault. It 
also equips him / her with a claim for damages either in accordance with the gen-
eral principles, or through the payment of an appropriate sum of money corre-
sponding to double or, where the infringement was culpable, triple the amount of 
remuneration due to him / her for the use of his / her work. Unlike in the Industrial 
Property Law, a punitive element is present here ( see also no 3 / 34 ); the claim for 
appropriate compensation is therefore not a typical &raquo; claim for use &laquo;.
</p>
<p>As already stated, a claim for disgorgement of profit is independent of the 
interferer&rsquo;s fault and as such subject to considerably more lenient requirements 
than a claim for damages. In accordance with the majority view, the Copyright Act 
claim for disgorgement of profit is to be distinguished from the unjustified en-
richment claim regulated in the Civil Code71. With regard to the claim for disgorge-
ment of profit based on art 287 of the Industrial Property Law, diverging views are 
presented: one treats it as an unjustified enrichment claim, and the other as a 
separate claim to which Civil Code provisions on unjustified enrichment are not

<p>applicable. Supporters of the latter view point out that case law and literature con-
cerning the claim for disgorgement of profit based on art 79 of the Copyright Act 
are also relevant for the claim regulated in art 287 of the Industrial Property Law72.
</p>
<p>C.  A new type of claim ?
</p>
<p>It is emphasised that claims for disgorgement of profit mirror the principle that 
unlawful interference with another&rsquo;s pecuniary rights should not be in any way 
profitable to the interferer73. Introducing such claims to the field of intellectual 
property law is a clear sign that the legislator is aware of the problem of wrongfully 
obtained gains, but does not mean that it is possible to automatically recognise 
parallel claims in other areas of law. As Koziol points out, introducing a new type 
of claim &ndash; a general claim for disgorgement of profit obtained through interfer-
ence which does not consist in use in the usual sense, constituting a mixture of a 
damages claim and an unjust enrichment claim &ndash; would be a bold step74, which is 
not possible in Poland without an explicit legal provision. Notwithstanding this, 
the proposal to introduce such a claim is certainly worth a thought, especially as 
Koziol&rsquo;s arguments in its favour are very convincing. Considering the possible in-
troduction of a claim for disgorgement of profit should be preceded by an inves-
tigation of whether it would be consistent with the solutions already adopted in 
intellectual property law. Koziol&rsquo;s proposal, based on the doctrine of allocation of 
goods and aimed at filling a &raquo; gap in protection &laquo; between the law of damages and 
the law of unjust enrichment75 involves introducing a claim the prerequisite of 
which is objective negligence. Unlike Austrian patent law, which requires culpable 
interference in order for the victim to seek disgorgement of profit and makes the 
&raquo; claim for use &laquo; independent of the interferer&rsquo;s fault76, Polish intellectual property 
law makes the claim for disgorgement of profit dependent on unlawfulness only, 
while the &raquo; claim for use &laquo;, which is an alternative to a claim for damages awarded 
in accordance with the general rules of the Civil Code, either requires fault ( art 287 
of the Industrial Property Law; the claim for triple the author&rsquo;s fee ( art 79 of the 
Copyright Act ), which, however, can hardly be labelled a claim for use due to the 
punitive elements present ), or is independent of fault ( the atypical &raquo; claim for use &laquo;, 
ie a claim for double the author&rsquo;s fee based on art 79 of the Copyright Act ). All in 
all, the Polish system is not entirely consistent, although with one constant pre-

</p>
<p>sent, namely that the claim for disgorgement of profit solely requires the infringe-
ment of a right. Taking this into account, it would seem unfitting to introduce a 
general disgorgement of profit claim with stricter requirements, especially as the 
finding of objective negligence tends in effect to be tantamount to the finding of 
fault ( see no 3 / 118 f below ).
</p>
<p>VII.  Claims for damages
</p>
<p>In order for damage to be shifted from the victim to another person, valid reasons 
must be present. Firstly, the other person must have caused the damage or, alter-
natively, harm must have been caused by a factor within his / her sphere of respon-
sibility. Secondly, other conditions must be fulfilled, such as fault on the part of 
said person, fault or unlawfulness of conduct on the part of another person for 
whom he / she is liable, or the existence within the person&rsquo;s sphere of control of a 
thing or an establishment which is a source of danger for others.
</p>
<p>The primary aim of tort law is to compensate the victim, although a deterrent 
function of delictual liability is also recognised. The penal notion does play a cer-
tain, limited role as well; it must, however, be emphasised that its recognition can-
not lead to an award of compensation in excess of the damage suffered.
</p>
<p>VIII.  Punitive damages
</p>
<p>Punitive damages are not accepted in Poland. Taking into account the fundamen-
tal principles underlying Polish private law, it seems highly unlikely that this situ-
ation will change. What may be seen as an exception to the general rejection of the 
idea of such damages is art 79 sec ( 1 )3b of the Copyright Act, according to which 
the author may claim from the person who culpably infringed his economic rights 
triple the amount of remuneration due to him / her for the use of his / her work ( see 
no 3 / 29 above ). Criticisms of this regulation have been voiced in the relevant lit-
erature77. Although, as convincingly argued by Koziol, the doubling of the author&rsquo;s 
fee can be reconciled with the notion of compensation78, the same cannot be said 
of its tripling in cases of culpable infringements.

</p>
<p>IX.  Insurance contract law
</p>
<p>In the case of indemnity insurance, the insured should not receive more than the 
amount of damage suffered. This is achieved by the means most common nowa-
days, that is by the victim&rsquo;s claim being transferred to the insurer to the extent of 
the insurance benefit paid out. If the benefit does not cover the damage in full, 
the victim&rsquo;s claim for the remaining amount of damage takes priority over the in-
surer&rsquo;s recourse claim against the tortfeasor ( art 828 &sect; 1 KC ). As for third-party li-
ability insurance, it is recognised as both promoting the compensatory function 
of tort law and weakening its deterrent effect, the latter being attenuated primarily 
through the use of a bonus-malus system.
</p>
<p>X.  Social security law
</p>
<p>Polish social security law, understood in a broad sense, encompasses social in-
surance ( comprising old-age pension insurance, disability and survivors&rsquo; pension 
insurance, sickness insurance and work accident insurance ), social assistance, 
national health insurance, benefits in respect of unemployment and family ben-
efits79. As is commonly the case in other countries80, it does not supersede the law 
of damages, which means that the two systems exist side by side. When it comes 
to the interplay between these two fields, two areas of social security law are of im-
portance, namely social insurance and national health insurance. In line with the 
idea that the victim should not be compensated twice for the same damage, it is 
accepted that social insurance benefits are in principle set off against the damages 
due from the tortfeasor81, and also that health services provided free of charge 
within the national healthcare system are taken into account while calculating

with later amendments ) is therefore deducted from the annuity due from the tortfeasor pursu-
ant to art 444 &sect; 2 or art 446 &sect; 2 KC ( for more on these provisions see no 3 / 161 f below ), whereas 
a so-called funeral allowance ( art 77 of the Act on Pensions from the Social Insurance Fund ) is 
not set off against the compensation awarded in accordance with art 446 &sect; 1 KC ( for the word-
ing of this provision see FN 82 below ) due to the fact that the function of such allowance is 
primarily social and not compensatory; see SN judgment of 15.  5.  2009, III CZP 140 / 08, Orzecz-

<p>damages, which means that only such medical expenses are compensated82 as 
have not been covered by public health insurance83. Notwithstanding the fact that 
social security benefits are deducted from damages, there is in principle no right 
of recourse against the liable injuring party on the part of the social security pro-
vider. As the Supreme Court ( Sąd Najwyższy; SN ) observed, the only provision in 
Polish law that explicitly grants such recourse84 &ndash; very limited in scope &ndash; is art 70 of 
the Act of 25 June 1999 on cash social insurance benefits in respect of sickness and 
maternity85, which entitles the Social Insurance Institution ( Zakład Ubezpieczeń 
Społecznych; ZUS ) to claim the reimbursement of the sickness allowance and the 
rehabilitation benefit from the person who caused the insured&rsquo;s inability to work 
through intentional crime or offence. As was pointed out by the Court, the fact that 
there are no provisions granting ZUS a right of recourse in other cases must not 
necessarily mean that this right does not exist; the lack of such provisions might 
be regarded as a loophole which could be filled by way of analogy86. The SN admit-
ted that considerations of justice speak in favour of granting recourse as denying 
it would mean relieving the person who caused damage of liability merely because 
the victim received compensation from a third party; in the end, however, it ne-
gated the existence of recourse claims with the justification that since the legisla-
tor explicitly allows such claims in specific cases it must be inferred that the lack 
of recourse in other cases is the result of a conscious decision87. In a judgment 
of 15 May 200988 the Court pointed out that one cannot be too hasty in affirming 
the existence of a loophole in social insurance law because what is crucial in this 
area of law is legal certainty. It emphasised that social insurance relations are 
regulated precisely and exhaustively, which means that if there is an issue that the 
legislator has not regulated, it must be assumed that it was its intention to do so.

<p>The Polish employee compensation scheme, which encompasses benefits reg-
ulated in the Act on Social Insurance Coverage in the case of Work Accidents and 
Professional Diseases of 200289, forms part of the social insurance system90. The 
Civil Code provisions on personal injury compensation complement the insur-
ance scheme as far as damage suffered by the employee is not covered by benefits 
due to him / her in accordance with the scheme91. As for damage to property suf-
fered by an employee who had an accident at work, the employer is obliged to re-
dress certain types of losses ( damage to personal belongings and items necessary 
to perform the work, with the exception of motor vehicles and money ) pursuant 
to art 237 1 &sect; 2 of the Labour Code ( kodeks pracy, hereinafter: KP )92. Other property 
damage is compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code93.
</p>
<p>XI.  Compensating victims of  
crime and catastrophes
</p>
<p>In accordance with the Act on State Compensation for Victims of Certain Crimes 
of 200594 ( hereinafter: UPK ), compensation specified by the Act is awarded in 
cases when a Polish citizen or a citizen of another EU country dies or suffers seri-
ous personal injury as a result of a crime committed in Poland. The compensation, 
designed to cover loss of earnings or other means of subsistence as well as costs of 
medical treatment, rehabilitation and funeral costs, is very limited as to amount: 
it cannot exceed PLN 12,000 ( approx &euro; 3,000 ) ( art 6 UPK ). It is awarded only pro-
vided that and insofar as the claimant is unable to obtain compensation for loss 
of earnings or other means of subsistence as well as the costs listed above from 
the perpetrator, an insurer, as social assistance benefits or from any other source. 
If the State Treasury awards compensation pursuant to the provisions of the UPK,

<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>the entitled person&rsquo;s claim is transferred to the state, and the State Treasury has a 
right of recourse against the perpetrator ( art 14 ); thus the risk of insolvency of the 
wrongdoer is transferred to the state.
</p>
<p>Importantly, compensation is awarded in accordance with the UPK regardless 
of whether the crime perpetrator or perpetrators have been identified, charged 
or convicted. For example, the Act explicitly grants the right to compensation in 
the case of the accused&rsquo;s death. However, unlike in Austria95, compensation can-
not be awarded when the perpetrator is unaccountable for his actions for reasons 
of insanity, in the case of self-defence or necessity. This is due to the fact that all 
these circumstances exclude the criminality of an act and the UPK expressly states 
that despite the fact that criminal proceedings have been initiated, compensa-
tion will not be awarded if the criminality of an act is excluded by statute ( art 7 &sect; 2 
UPK in conjunction with art 17 &sect; 1 pt 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [ kodeks 
postępowania karnego; hereinafter: KPK ] )96.
</p>
<p>There is no scheme in Poland comparable to that implemented by the Austrian 
Act on a Fund for Catastrophes97; ad-hoc solutions are preferred. This approach 
definitely raises the problem of equality and the question arises why state relief 
can only be expected in the case of events that affect a large number of people.
</p>
<p>XII.  Disgorgement claims
</p>
<p>As in the Germanic systems, the principle of bilateral justification of legal conse-
quences is present not only in the law of tort, and disgorgement in favour of the 
state rather than the impoverished party is no stranger to the Polish law of unjust 
enrichment. According to art 412 KC, the court may order a forfeiture of the sub-
ject matter of performance to the benefit of the State Treasury if the performance 
was made in return for an act prohibited by statute or for an ignoble purpose. It 
must be noted that the court is not obliged to order the forfeiture and that, unlike 
a duty to return the advantage in the general provisions on unjust enrichment, the 
forfeiture may be ordered in cases when the party who gained an advantage is no 
longer enriched.
</p>
<p>Like the Germanic codes, the Polish Criminal Code ( kodeks karny; KK )98 also 
provides for the forfeiture of assets that the perpetrator gained by his / her crimi-
nal act ( arts 44, 45 KK ). The forfeiture will not be ordered if the assets are to be

<p>returned to the aggrieved party or to another authorised person. The forfeiture 
of assets gained by a criminal act is also provided for by the Fiscal Offences Code 
( kodeks karny skarbowy, hereinafter: KKS )99 ( see, inter alia, art 22 &sect; 2 KKS; art 29 
( 1 ) KKS ).
</p>
<p>XIII.  Criminal law
</p>
<p>It is a truism to state that the aims of tort law and those of criminal law are fun-
damentally different. Although, unlike tort law, criminal law is not directed at the 
compensation of damage suffered, it is no stranger to the notion of restitution, 
which means that &ndash; as Koziol puts it &ndash; a certain interdependence between the two 
areas of law can be discerned100.
</p>
<p>The compensatory function became more significant after the entry into force 
of the new Criminal Code in 1997, which strengthened the position of the crime 
victim; this meant that crime stopped being perceived predominantly as a con-
flict between the perpetrator and society, but also began to be considered a clash 
between the wrongdoer and the aggrieved party101. As indicated by Zoll and Wr&oacute;-
bel, the function of compensation is strongly united with the function of justice 
and expressed most fully in the context of reparative justice. Viewed from this 
perspective, the aim of criminal law is to eliminate tension created in society by 
the commission of a crime; in order to achieve this goal, the perpetrator should 
redress damage caused by his crime. Criminal law therefore should not only pun-
ish the perpetrator, but also lead to the reparation of the harm that he caused102. 
Thus, certain punitive measures are known to it that clearly fulfill a compensa-
tory function; these are: &raquo; obowiązek naprawienia szkody lub zadośćuczynienia za 
doznaną krzywdę &laquo; ( a duty to redress damage or to compensate for pain and suf-
fering ) ( art 46 &sect; 1 KK ) and &raquo; nawiązka &laquo; ( art 46 &sect; 2 KK ), which can be ordered in-
stead of this duty and which is de facto a flat-rate compensation103. There has been 
much debate on whether the duty to redress damage imposed pursuant to art 46 
KK should be covered by third-party motor vehicle liability insurance of the per-
petrator104.

<p>The fact that the perpetrator has redressed damage may result in an extraordi-
nary mitigation of punishment ( art 60 &sect; 2 ( 1 ) KK ), and in the law regarding fiscal 
offences the circumstance that the offender has fully paid his public levies due is 
a condition for the cancellation of punishability ( in the case of offences consisting 
in the diminishment of public levies due; art 16 &sect; 2 KKS ).

<p> Part 3 The tasks of tort law
</p>
<p>Three principal functions of liability for damage are distinguished in Polish lit-
erature: the function of compensation, the function of deterrence and the penalty 
function105.
</p>
<p>I.  Compensatory function
</p>
<p>It is undisputed that the main function of tort law is that of compensation. Polish 
law adheres to the principle of full restitution, expressed in art 361 &sect; 2 KC, which 
states that, in the absence of a legal provision or a contractual clause stating oth-
erwise, the redress of damage encompasses losses suffered by the injured party as 
well as profits that he / she could have obtained had he / she not suffered damage 
( see also no 3 / 157 below ). Art 363 &sect; 2 KC, pursuant to which the amount of dam-
ages is determined in accordance with the prices existing on the date of calcula-
tion of compensation106, as well as the observance of the principle of &raquo; compensa-
tio lucri cum damno &laquo;, also serve the embodiment of the compensatory function. 
There are, of course, exceptions to the principle of &raquo; restitutio in integrum &laquo;;  for 
example, art 440 KC ( see no 3 / 164 below ) allows for a reduction of damages in ac-
cordance with the circumstances of the case if such a reduction is required by the 
principles of community life in view of the financial situation of the injured party 
or of the person liable for damage if both parties are natural persons; arts 114 ff KP 
reduce the compensatory function of employee&rsquo;s liability towards his employer 
by making the former liable only for the latter&rsquo;s actual loss as well as by limiting 
damages to three times the monthly salary ( see also no 3 / 158 below )107. The com-

ofiarowana Profesorowi J&oacute;zefowi Skąpskiemu ( 1994 ) 297.
</p>
<p>106 Unless special circumstances ( such as, eg, the fact that the injured party repaired the damage 
earlier by him / herself ) require that prices from a different point in time be taken as a basis for 
the assessment; this rule, expressed in art 363 &sect; 2, also serves the purpose of compensation.

</p>
<p>pensatory function is decisive also in the area of non-pecuniary loss108. Several au-
thors claim that this function of non-pecuniary damages also covers the feeling of 
satisfaction derived by the injured party from the fact that the legal system reacted 
to the infringement of his / her personality rights109, and insist that satisfaction on 
the part of the victim means that the compensatory function is also fulfilled in 
cases when the latter demands that an appropriate sum of money is awarded for 
a social purpose110.
</p>
<p>II.  Function of deterrence and continuation of a right 
( Rechtsfortsetzungsfunktion )
</p>
<p>The deterrent function of tortious liability111 is only secondary. The majority of 
Polish legal writers recognise it in the area of fault-based liability and stress its 
negligible ( or none at all ) significance in the field of strict liability112. A different 
view, according to which strict liability also fulfils a preventive function, has, how-
ever, also been expressed113.
</p>
<p>As for the notion of the continuation of a right ( Rechtsfortsetzungsgedanke ), 
its presence in Polish law may be discerned insofar as the concept of objective-
abstract damage assessment is recognised ( see no 3 / 71 f below ).

right ( the provision speaks of a violation of &raquo; dobra osobiste &laquo; on the notion of &raquo; dobra osobiste &laquo; 
see FN 31 above ), a court may grant to the person whose right has been violated an appropriate 
sum of money as compensation for non-pecuniary loss or, following the request of the injured 
party, award an appropriate sum of money for a social purpose indicated by the victim, irre-
spective of other means required to remove the effects of the violation.
</p>
<p>111 Which, as has been emphasised by several authors, is to be understood as special deterrence, 
and not as general deterrence; see, inter alia, Szpunar, PiP no 1 / 2003, 22.

</p>
<p>III.  Penalty function
</p>
<p>It is stressed that the diminution of the perpetrator&rsquo;s patrimony connected with 
his duty to redress damage is supposed to act as a penalty, but the punitive func-
tion of tortious liability only fulfils a secondary role114, and is rejected in the area 
of strict liability115. It is pointed out by several authors, including Szpunar &ndash; one of 
the most distinguished Polish private law professors &ndash; that the idea of retribution 
is difficult to reconcile with the principles underlying civil liability for damage. 
Szpunar also emphasises that this difficulty disappears if punitive components 
do not exist alone, but in conjunction with compensation or prevention116. It may 
therefore be said that penalisation is only accepted in Polish private law as a by-
product of compensation or a prerequisite of the deterrent impact of tortious li-
ability117. The dependent character of punitive elements is corroborated by the 
fact that no &raquo; true &laquo; penalty, ie penalty going beyond the purpose of compensation, 
can be imposed in tort law118. Regardless of the degree of fault, it can never lead 
to an award of damages in excess of the damage suffered119. A punitive function 
is known to have been attributed to non-pecuniary damages, but &ndash; as has already 
been pointed out &ndash; the purpose of such damages is to make good the loss suffered, 
and not to penalise the perpetrator. If a higher sum of money is awarded when 
there is serious fault on the part of the tortfeasor, it is not for punitive purposes, 
but because in such cases non-pecuniary damage tends to be more sizeable120.

</p>
<p> Part 4  The area between tort and breach of an 
obligation
</p>
<p>I.  Tort, breach of contract and the interim area
</p>
<p>Polish law separates tort ( arts 415 ff KC ) from breaches of contract ( arts 471 ff KC ). 
Similarly to German law, no interim area is formally recognised, and unlike it, the 
prevailing view classifies breaches of pre-contractual duties of care as belonging 
to the field of tort121, although at the same time it is acknowledged that culpa in 
contrahendo122 may in certain cases consist in an infringement of an existing ob-
ligation123. At this point a diverging opinion should also be noted, in accordance 
with which liability for culpa in contrahendo constitutes a special regime, sepa-
rate from both tortious and contractual liability124.
</p>
<p>The provisions on causation and on the extent as well as methods of compen-
sation ( arts 361&ndash;363 KC ) are common to both tort and contract. The prevailing view 
is that art 355 KC, which defines due diligence of the debtor, is also applicable to 
both these fields ( see also no 3 / 117 below ).
</p>
<p>The issues dealt with differently under tort and contract are above all the bur-
den of proof of liability ( burden of proof of fault ), vicarious liability and prescrip-
tion as well as compensable damage.
</p>
<p>In accordance with art 471 KC, a debtor is obliged to redress damage caused 
by the non-performance or inappropriate performance of an obligation unless the 
non-performance or inappropriate performance was caused by circumstances for 
which he / she is not liable. This, in conjunction with art 472 KC, means that the

III CZP 33 / 90, OSNC no 1 / 1991, item 3.
</p>
<p>122 The basic Civil Code provision dealing with culpa in contrahendo is art 72 &sect; 2 KC, which states 
that the party who initiated or conducted negotiations contra bonos mores, and in particular 
with no intention of concluding the contract, is obliged to redress the damage that the other 
party sustained due to the fact that he / she relied on the conclusion of the contract.
</p>
<p>123 See Radwański / Olejniczak, Zobowiązania 139, who give the example of a violation of a frame-
work agreement. The existence of an obligation is also acknowledged in the case of art 72 1 KC, 
which deals with the infringement of a duty not to disclose confidential information or turn it 
over to third parties; see, inter alia, Radwański / Olejniczak, Zobowiązania 139; M. Krajewski in: E.

</p>
<p>debtor will in principle not be liable if it is demonstrated that he / she exercised 
due diligence125. The burden of proof is therefore reversed in comparison to tort, 
where the victim needs to prove all the prerequisites of liability, including the tort-
feasor&rsquo;s fault126.
</p>
<p>In contract the principal bears comprehensive liability for the acts of aux-
iliaries that he / she entrusts with the performance of his / her obligations ( see 
no 3 / 122 )127. In tort, liability for auxiliaries is either based on presumed culpa in 
eligendo ( art 429 KC ) or is strict, but dependent on the auxiliary&rsquo;s fault ( art 430 
KC; see no 3 / 123 ff ). All in all, liability for auxiliaries is stricter in contract than it 
is in tort.
</p>
<p>Limitation periods in contract are generally shorter than in tort ( on prescrip-
tion in tort see chapter 9 ).
</p>
<p>Although the Civil Code does not contain the equivalent of art 157 &sect; 3 in its 
predecessor &ndash; the Code of Obligations ( kodeks zobowiązań; KZ )128, the traditional 
and still prevailing view is that non-pecuniary damages may only be awarded in 
cases expressly provided for by statute, thus only in the field of tortious liability129. 
This view finds support in the systematics of the Civil Code, since the provisions 
on compensation for non-pecuniary loss ( see no 3 / 64 ) are situated in the code sec-
tion dealing with torts. It follows from the above that an award of non-pecuniary 
damages in the case of non-performance or inappropriate performance of an ob-
ligation is only possible if such non-performance / inappropriate performance is 
at the same time a tort130; this, as well as longer limitation periods in the case of 
delictual liability, has resulted in the courts&rsquo; relative proneness to assume that 
it is indeed the case. This tendency has been subject to criticism, with the crit-
ics labelling it as excessive and emphasising the obvious: that a tort is only com-
mitted if there is a violation of duties that must be observed by everybody, which 
can be committed by anyone, irrespective of whether they remain in a contractual 
 
 
</p>
<p>125 Pursuant to art 472 KC, if nothing else is stipulated by statute or by a legal act, the debtor is li-
able for the failure to apply due diligence.
</p>
<p>126 There are exceptions to this rule as liability may be based on presumed fault ( eg art 427 KC ).
127 Art 474 KC states that he / she is liable for their acts and omissions as for his / her own.

<p>relationship with the injured party131. At the same time, it is being brought up 
in the relevant literature that the law should be changed and that damages for 
non-pecuniary loss should not be restricted to tortious liability132. These propos-
als are mirrored in the results of the work conducted within the Commission for 
the Codification of Private Law, which is preparing a draft of the new Civil Code. 
The Commission made plans to allow for an award of damages for non-pecuniary 
loss caused by the non-performance or improper performance of an obligation 
provided that such an award is justified by the nature of the obligation, in that 
such aims to satisfy a non-pecuniary interest of the creditor133. Several authors 
are of the opinion that non-pecuniary damages may be awarded within the con-
tractual regime de lege lata if a non-performance or inappropriate performance 
of an obligation has led to bodily injury or a health disorder, ie in cases of viola-
tion of personality rights indicated in art 445 KC ( see no 3 / 64 below )134. A further 
reaching view has also been expressed, according to which arts 445 and 448 KC135 
can be applied mutatis mutandis in the field of contractual liability, entailing the 
possibility to award non-pecuniary damages in contract in cases of infringement 
of all personality rights136. It is worth noting that art 242 KZ expressly stated that 
tortious provisions on damage compensation are applicable mutatis mutandis to 
contracts, which de facto made it possible to establish liability in contract and at 
the same time award damages for non-pecuniary loss137; the Civil Code does not, 
however, contain the equivalent of art 242 KZ.

<p>II.  The problem of concurrent claims
</p>
<p>Contractual and tortious claims are deemed to exist independently of one another 
in Polish law. In accordance with art 443 KC, &raquo; the fact that the act or omission 
from which the damage arose constituted the non-performance or the improper 
performance of a pre-existing obligation does not preclude a claim for damages in 
tort, unless the pre-existing obligation provides otherwise &laquo;138. It is assumed that 
this provision entitles the injured party to choose a liability regime, and the pre-
vailing view is that the two regimes cannot be &raquo; mixed &laquo;139. In other words, it is ei-
ther tort or contract, with all the consequences of the choice made. In this context, 
Łętowska points out that while it is unacceptable to create a &raquo; hybrid claim &laquo; based 
on mixed contractual and delictual prerequisites, one needs to be more cautious 
when negating the possibility to complement a contractual claim for damages 
with a claim for compensation of pecuniary or non-pecuniary loss140. It must also 
be noted that, according to Ohanowicz, it is possible to accumulate claims that do 
not overlap, hence for instance a victim who opts for the contractual regime may 
at the same time be entitled to compensation for non-pecuniary damage provided 
that the prerequisites for tortious liability for such damage are fulfilled141. Polish 
courts are known to have failed to comply with the requirement of &raquo; regime purity &laquo; 
in travel law cases142. For instance, in a case decided in March 1968, the Supreme 
Court found a Polish tour operator liable for the conduct of the Bulgarian health 
service, whose negligence led to the death of one of the holidaymakers, based 
on the provisions on contractual liability for auxiliaries143 and at the same time 
awarded to the next of kin of the deceased an annuity as well as compensation for 
a considerable deterioration of their standard of living based on the provisions on 
tortious liability144.

<p>to free himself from liability on the grounds that the performance was entrusted to a profes-

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>It follows from the above that Polish law is not familiar with the concept of a 
uniform basis for a claim for damages145. Although the idea of creating overall li-
ability rules combining the principles of tortious and contractual liability and de-
signed especially for particular interim cases or for situations where a breach of 
contract is at the same time a tort146 is very sensible and commendable given the 
solution&rsquo;s flexibility and adaptability to specific cases, it is hard to imagine it find-
ing support in Poland, at least in the foreseeable future. The attachment to the 
traditional dualism of regimes and &raquo; hard and fast rules &laquo; rather than flexible solu-
tions is strong. Using Koziol&rsquo;s words147, one can speak of a &raquo; denial of the interim 
area &laquo;, which means that each situation is allocated either to the field of contract, 
or to the realm of tort ( or to both with a right to choose the regime; see no 3 / 59 
above ), but not &raquo; in between &laquo; ( see no 3 / 52 above ). This has, for instance, led &ndash; as 
indicated above &ndash; to the classification of breaches of pre-contractual duties of care 
( culpa in contrahendo ) as torts148. As already noted, the &raquo; mixing and matching &laquo; of 
regimes in cases of breaches of contract that are at the same time torts is deemed 
inadmissible. Rather than accept it, scholars prefer to put forward changes in law 
or re-interpret the law in force, and eg postulate the introduction of non-pecuni-
ary damages also in the field of contractual liability. The adherence to the dichot-
omy of liability regimes was recently questioned, but the proposal to divert from it 
has not found wider resonance; also, the said proposal does not involve develop-
ing combinations of rules based on the intensity of the relationship between the 
perpetrator and the victim, but an introduction of a monistic regime with sets of 
special provisions regulating liability differently, such different regulation being 
justified either by the characteristics of the perpetrator, or by the circumstances 
of damage infliction149.

</p>
<p>I.  Damage
</p>
<p>A.  Introduction
</p>
<p>Like the vast majority of legal systems, Polish law does not define the term &raquo; dam-
age &laquo;. It has been argued that such a definition was not needed as damage was suf-
ficiently well defined in everyday language150. It does, however, go without saying 
that a natural definition of damage is not sufficient for the purposes of the law of 
damages, where not every type of loss that has been suffered matters, but only 
such as is deemed recoverable151. It is also pointed out that damage has more than 
one meaning in everyday language152, whereas legal language requires precision. 
Legal doctrine usually defines ( recoverable ) damage as harm to legally protected 
rights or interests153. A component often added to the definition is that damage is 
harm suffered by a person against their will154; this element is, however, disputed155.
</p>
<p>As far as the special problem of damage to the environment as a common 
good is concerned156, the concept as such is recognised. When unlawful conduct 
poses threat of such damage or where damage has already been caused, the State 
Treasury, a local government unit or an ecological organisation may demand that 
the lawful position is restored as well as preventive measures undertaken by the 
liable person157.

</p>
<p>B.  Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage
</p>
<p>1.  In general
</p>
<p>Depending on which interests are infringed, either pecuniary or non-pecuniary 
loss is suffered by the victim, the former described as harm affecting assets that 
have a pecuniary value158, and the latter defined as an infringement not reflected 
in the injured party&rsquo;s patrimony159. A minority view regards non-pecuniary loss as 
a concept separate from the notion of damage, to which the provisions on damage 
may only be applied mutatis mutandis; from this perspective, damage means only 
pecuniary loss160. In accordance, however, with the view dominant in the jurispru-
dence and in the relevant literature, both pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses are 
subcategories of damage161.
</p>
<p>2.  The special nature of non-pecuniary damage
</p>
<p>As has already been indicated162, Polish law falls into the group of legal systems 
that are restrictive when it comes to granting damages for non-pecuniary loss. 
The Civil Code only allows for the award of such damages when the victim suf-
fered bodily injury or a health disorder ( irrespective of whether liability is fault-
based or strict ) ( art 445 KC ), in the case of a culpable infringement of a personal-
ity right ( art 448 in conjunction with art 24 &sect; 1 KC ) and in the case of death of a 
&raquo; closest family member &laquo; ( bereavement damages; art 446 &sect; 4 KC ). An award of non-
pecuniary damages remains at the court&rsquo;s discretion, ie it is not compulsory. It is, 
however, widely acknowledged that &raquo; discretion &laquo; is not tantamount to complete 
freedom and that compensation may only be denied on the basis of objectively 
verifiable criteria163. A refusal is justified if such criteria indicate that no non-pecu-
niary damage has been inflicted or that the loss suffered is trivial ( insignificant )164.
</p>
<p>As Koziol emphasises, since it is intrinsically difficult to assess whether and 
to what extent a person has sustained non-pecuniary damage, recourse is had to 
objective indicators which help in such assessment165. This idea is present also in 
Polish law. Safjan points out that in evaluating the extent of suffering and nega-

</p>
<p>tive feelings, objective criteria should be applied, which, however, need to be re-
lated to the circumstances of each case166. Several authors accentuate the need to 
award similar sums in similar cases, which would help avoid jurisprudential dis-
parities and ensure greater predictability of case law concerning non-pecuniary 
loss167, but the Supreme Court, which stresses the individual character of moral 
harm, is quite cautious when approaching the subject. It treats sums awarded in 
similar cases as &raquo; indicatory guidelines &laquo;168 and is not entirely consistent as to how 
much weight it ascribes to them. On the one hand, it regards referring to compa-
rable cases as useful ( albeit to a limited extent due to the subjective character of 
non-pecuniary loss )169, and on the other states that sums awarded in similar cases 
cannot be regarded as an additional criterion justifying the reduction of dam-
ages, and also that it is impossible to measure whether non-pecuniary damage in 
a given case is smaller or greater than the loss suffered by another person, even if 
the latter suffered similar injuries and is in a comparable life situation170. There 
are no tables reporting the amounts of non-pecuniary damages granted by Polish 
courts171 which &ndash; if need be &ndash; could facilitate referring to other cases.
</p>
<p>3.  Non-pecuniary harm to legal entities
</p>
<p>There is no unanimity in Polish literature as to whether legal entities may sustain 
non-pecuniary harm and consequently be awarded non-pecuniary damages. The 
only provision that could possibly enable such an award is art 448 KC, as both 
art 445 KC and art 446 &sect; 4 KC by their nature apply only to natural persons. Several 
authors claim that since legal entities are incapable of mental suffering, there is 
no non-pecuniary damage that can be compensated172. Others are of the opinion 
that art 448 may be applied also in cases of violations of legal entities&rsquo; personality 
rights173 and emphasise that the non-pecuniary interests of such entities, such as 
good reputation, should be protected to the same extent as those of natural per-
sons174. The latter view finds support in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court175.

<p>197Part 5&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;basic&emsp;criteria&emsp;for&emsp;a&emsp;compensation&emsp;claim
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>In a judgment of 11 January 2007176, the Court expressly stated that the personality 
rights of a legal entity &raquo; should not be linked exclusively with its organs or with the 
natural persons creating the legal person &laquo; since &raquo; the essence of a legal entity lies 
in its separate legal existence &laquo; and that &raquo; a legal person has a right to have its repu-
tation and good will protected &laquo;177.
</p>
<p>4.  The problem of loss of use
</p>
<p>Not a lot of attention has been paid to the issue of loss of use in Poland, with the 
vast majority of discussions focusing on the use of motor vehicles. Doctrinal and 
jurisprudential doubts as to the issue of compensability of the cost of hire of a 
replacement vehicle have recently been settled by the Supreme Court, which de-
cided that &raquo; expedient and economically justifiable &laquo; costs of hire need to be com-
pensated even when an accident-damaged car was not used for professional or 
business purposes178. As for &raquo; pure &laquo; loss of use of an object, there is no unanimity 
in the Polish doctrine. Szpunar claims that if the injured party has not incurred 
the cost of hire of a replacement, then he / she has not suffered pecuniary dam-
age179, which in effect means that no compensation should be awarded. His view 
is shared, inter alia, by Kaliński, who points out that in order for pecuniary damage 
to exist it must be possible to demonstrate it in accordance with the theory of dif-
ference, and notes the difficulties that present themselves when establishing the 
&raquo; use value &laquo; of certain assets in isolation from the injured party&rsquo;s subjective feel-
ings180. Dybowski, on the other hand, offers arguments supporting the view that pe-
cuniary damage is suffered by the injured party irrespective of whether a replace-
ment was hired or not, since in both cases a lost &raquo; use value &laquo; is at stake; the value 
must, however, be &raquo; real &laquo;, so for instance no damage will be suffered if the injured 
party cannot use the object anyway due to his / her stay abroad. Even if the object 
in question was used for private purposes, the injured party&rsquo;s harm is not solely 
an &raquo; inconvenience &laquo; since it consists in the loss of possibility to use an asset that 
has a certain pecuniary value; the aim of such an object is to meet socially impor-
tant needs of the victim ( in the fields of culture, leisure, tourism ) and while the 
needs themselves cannot be &raquo; converted &laquo; into money, the value of use of the object

</p>
<p>satisfying them over a period of time can181. This can be countered, along with La-
renz and Koziol, with the argument that the owner&rsquo;s right of use is but one aspect 
of ownership, which is already included in its assessment. Pecuniary damage fol-
lowing the loss of use is, therefore, already incorporated in the loss of value of an 
object and must not be compensated again182.
</p>
<p>If one adopts the convincing view that the owner&rsquo;s right to use is not a sepa-
rate asset but just one of the aspects of ownership, then one must come to the 
conclusion that what is left for reparation is non-pecuniary damage consisting in 
the loss of convenience caused by the deprivation of the possibility to use183. Such 
non-pecuniary harm is de lege lata not recoverable under Polish law. Notwith-
standing this, the proposal to compensate non-pecuniary losses which are rela-
tively easily assessed to the same extent as pecuniary damage is certainly worth 
considering de lege ferenda. As Koziol points out, the loss of convenience fulfils 
the said criterion, since the needs met by the damaged object can be satisfied 
through the use of another object against payment and the expenditure necessary 
to procure such may serve as an indicator184. Whether the proposal has a chance to 
succeed in Poland is another matter, especially in view of the fact that damages for 
non-pecuniary loss are firmly rejected in the field of damage to property.
</p>
<p>Like in Germany, awarding damages for the mere loss of enjoyment or leisure 
time is a circumvention of the law185 in Poland. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court, 
acting in line with the European Union case law, or, more precisely, with the Leit-
ner case186, allowed for the award of compensation for the loss of enjoyment of a 
holiday trip187. The Court stated that such a loss constitutes non-pecuniary dam-
age and held that it should be compensated based on art 11a of the Tourist Ser-
vices Act of 1997188 ( hereinafter: TSA ), which regulates contractual liability of a tour 
operator. According to the Supreme Court, since art 11a TSA is an implementation 
of art 5 of the Package Tours Directive189, it should be interpreted in the same way, 
which means that damage within its meaning should be understood broadly, as 
encompassing both pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss.

</p>
<p>As for real versus calculable damage, there are diverging opinions in Polish lit-

damage190, while others express the view that one can only speak of damage when 
referring to the consequences of such a breach191.

<p>It is subjective-concrete damage that is compensated under Polish law192. In 
the course of damage assessment, one needs to take into account the overall situ-
ation of the injured party and not the state of a particular asset that has been dam-
aged; the recoverable harm is calculated based on the victim&rsquo;s individual position 
and all the circumstances of the case in question193. The theory of difference is ac-
cepted both in the jurisprudence and in the relevant literature, with the Supreme 
Court defining damage as the difference between the state of assets that the in-
jured party would have had at his / her disposal had it not been for the damaging 
event, and the state of his / her assets after this event194. To be precise, what is sub-
ject to comparison is the actual state of the victim&rsquo;s assets and their hypotheti-
cal state, ie the state that these assets would have been in had it not been for the 
damaging event195. The concept of objective damage is also recognised, the objec-
tive method being regarded by many as a starting point in the course of damage 
assessment, which allows the determination of the minimum amount of compen-
sable damage196. Also, objective-abstract assessment is in fact used when calculat-
ing compensation for the loss of commercial value: as the Supreme Court pointed 
out in one of its judgments dealing with this problem197, &raquo; the value of a car after

</p>
<p>192 Art 160 KZ gave priority to the objective method of assessing damage. It stated that pecuniary 
damage is to be determined based on the market value of a thing and that the special value 
that the thing posed for the injured party was to be taken into account only in cases of intent 
or gross negligence of the perpetrator. The Civil Code contains no equivalent of this provision.

<p>repair is ( &hellip; ) its market value. ( emphasis KLR ) Since this value ( &hellip; ) has decreased 
in comparison to the market value that the car would have had it not been dam-
aged, compensation should encompass not only the costs of repair, but also the 
difference in value &laquo;198. The loss of commercial value of a car is therefore measured 
by its value on the market and considered compensable irrespective of whether it 
has manifested itself in the car&rsquo;s sale. This &ndash; as pointed out by Koziol199 &ndash; is a clear 
sign of objective-abstract assessment.
</p>
<p>Finally, it needs to be mentioned that several provisions of Polish private law, 
eg those dealing with carriers&rsquo; liability, explicitly restrict compensation to objec-
tive damage, thus establishing exceptions from the principle of full compensa-
tion200. The objective method of assessing damage may also be applied based on 
contractual stipulations.
</p>
<p>Although the theory of difference is traditionally associated with pecuniary 
damage, Kaliński points out that it applies to non-pecuniary loss as well, except 
that rather than compare the state of the victim&rsquo;s patrimony before the damaging 
event and as a result of this event, one needs to capture the difference between 
his / her emotional state at these two points in time201.
</p>
<p>D.  Positive damage and loss of profits
</p>
<p>The Civil Code distinguishes between damnum emergens and lucrum cessans, 
but &ndash; as in German law &ndash; the distinction does not in principle have any greater 
significance since pursuant to art 361 &sect; 2 KC, the redress of damage encompasses 
both losses actually suffered and profits that the injured party could have ob-
tained if damage had not been inflicted. Exceptions to this rule may, however, be 
introduced by a statutory provision or by a contractual clause. De lege lata  the 
most important of the former is art 438 KC202, which states that &raquo; A person who 
acts out of duty or even voluntarily to avert the risk of damage to another or to 
avert a common danger, and suffers pecuniary loss, may demand redress for the 
loss  sustained  from the persons who benefited thereby in appropriate ratios &laquo;203 
( emphasis KLR ). Art 438 KC also deserves special mention because the extent of 
compensation depends not only on the size of the loss sustained by the injured 
party, but also on the extent of benefits derived by the other persons204.

<p>E.  Damage in the case of unwanted birth ?
</p>
<p>Although legal problems associated with unwanted birth have been present in 
Polish case law for a relatively short time205, several important issues have been ad-
dressed by our courts. Like in other legal systems, it has been acknowledged in Po-
land that harm connected with unwanted conception and / or birth cannot be as-
sociated with the child itself206. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that the 
birth of a child, including one affected with a genetic defect, cannot in any event 
be regarded as damage207. What have to date been considered compensable harm 
are additional expenses connected with pregnancy and childbirth as well as the 
loss of income by the mother in consequence of these events208. The issue of main-
tenance costs has also been addressed, with the Supreme Court stating that re-
coverable damage encompasses increased costs of supporting a handicapped child209 
( in cases where the parents&rsquo; right to plan a family and to have the pregnancy ter-
minated was violated by a doctor&rsquo;s faulty conduct )210 as well as the costs of main-
tenance of a healthy child to the extent that the child&rsquo;s mother is unable to meet the 
child&rsquo;s legitimate needs ( in a case where a raped woman delivered a healthy child 
following an unlawful refusal of an abortion )211. In the case concerning a child 
conceived through rape, the Court stated that it is a rare example of a situation 
where unlawful actions result in a consequence which is both positive and recog-
nised as valuable in society ( the birth of a child ), but at the same time distinctly 
separated this positive consequence from damage consisting in the costs of main-
tenance that the mother was forced to incur. Interestingly though, and notwith-
standing this argumentation, it did not order compensation of these costs in full, 
but only &raquo; to the extent that the mother was unable to meet the child&rsquo;s legitimate 
</p>
<p>205 The first &raquo; typical &laquo; wrongful conception case was decided by the Supreme Court in November 
2003, and the first wrongful birth judgment was issued in October 2005 ( see below ).

<p>needs &laquo;. This limitation, which seems to indicate, although it was not expressly 
stated, that the Court thought it appropriate to make an overall assessment of the 
situation and set off non-pecuniary advantages ( birth of a child and ( possibly ) 
creation of a family relationship ) against pecuniary disadvantages, and which cor-
responds with the mediatory solution advocated by the Austrian Supreme Court 
( OGH )212, has been questioned in the relevant literature213.
</p>
<p>With regard to the issue of non-pecuniary damage caused by the frustration of 
family planning, the Supreme Court stated in its decision of 21 November 2003214 
that forcing the claimant to give birth to a baby conceived through rape consti-
tutes an infringement of &raquo; broadly understood liberty, encompassing the right to 
decide about one&rsquo;s personal life &laquo;, and later held on several occasions that the right 
to plan a family, of which the right to a lawful abortion is a consequence, consti-
tutes a personality right, the violation of which justifies an award of compensa-
tion for non-pecuniary loss based on art 448 KC in conjunction with art 24 &sect; 1 KC215. 
In a judgment of 12 June 2008216 the Court ruled that the doctors&rsquo; refusal to refer 
a pregnant woman to prenatal testing when it was probable that the foetus was 
affected with a genetic defect as well as their failure to provide full information 
about this situation violated the woman&rsquo;s right to plan a family and to make an in-
formed decision to either have a handicapped child or to terminate the pregnancy, 
which meant that she was entitled to compensation for non-pecuniary loss.

<p>II.  Causation
</p>
<p>A.  General remarks
</p>
<p>Causation fulfils a dual function in tort law: it is a prerequisite of liability and at 
the same time a factor setting the limits of liability, ie determining the extent of 
damage that must be compensated217. The first step in the course of establishing 
causation in Polish law is, quite unsurprisingly, a conditio sine qua non test, used 
to &raquo; sift away &laquo; events that are not causally connected with the damage inflicted. 
The test allows the determination of whether an event attributed to the defendant 
can be taken into account at all in the process of assessing the latter&rsquo;s liability218. 
The second step is the application of the criterion of adequacy, which finds its le-
gal basis in art 361 &sect; 1 KC, according to which the person obliged to pay damages 
is only liable for the normal consequences of the act or omission from which the 
damage resulted219. Although the provision only speaks of the consequences of 
an &raquo; act or omission &laquo;, it is beyond doubt that the criterion of normality also refers 
to situations where damage results from events which are neither acts nor omis-
sions220. The theory of adequacy is dealt with under no 3 / 148 ff below.
</p>
<p>B.  Causation through someone&rsquo;s sphere
</p>
<p>Liability does not necessarily depend on causal, damaging conduct of the liable 
party him / herself; a good example here is vicarious liability for auxiliaries ( art 430 
KC )221 or strict liability for various sources of danger ( arts 433, 434, 435, 436 KC )222. 
As is rightly emphasised223, in such cases the liable party is often at least indirectly 
involved in the chain of causation in that he / she employed the auxiliaries or holds 
the things that caused damage, or put a dangerous undertaking into operation, 
although in some instances even indirect causation cannot be affirmed and it is 
solely causation by the sphere of auxiliaries / things / undertakings which suffices 
to trigger liability.

<p>C.  Omissions as cause
</p>
<p>As already noted, it is expressly recognised in Polish law ( art 361 &sect; 1 KC ) that 
omissions can be causal for damage. As the Supreme Court stated in one of its 
judgments dating from the 1950s, a normal causal connection between a faulty 
omission and damage exists when an action, if it had been taken, would have 
eliminated the factor remaining in normal causal connection with the damage224. 
The causality of omissions in Poland is &ndash; in accordance with a view widely held in-
ternationally &ndash; commonly associated with the existence of a duty to act225. In order 
for liability to arise, a duty to act must therefore be established as well as a pos-
sibility to act on the part of the person to whom liability is attributed and the fact 
that an action, if undertaken, could have prevented the occurrence of damage in 
the normal course of events226.
</p>
<p>D.  The attenuation of the causation requirement
</p>
<p>1.  Liability of several tortfeasors
</p>
<p>There is no equivalent of &sect; 1301 ABGB or of &sect; 830( 1 ) sent 1 BGB in the Polish Civil 
Code. The liability of several tortfeasors is regulated in art 441 &sect; 1 KC, which is 
the equivalent of &sect; 840 ( 1 ) BGB and states that if several persons are liable for 
( one and the same &ndash; comment KLR ) damage inflicted by a delict, their liability is 
joint and several. This applies both to co-perpetrators and to situations in which 
each of the tortfeasors is liable on a different tort law basis ( and also on the ba-
sis of a different principle of liability )227. Art 441 KC does not allow for an abroga-
tion of joint and several liability and a distribution of damages pro rata parte  228;

<p>205Part 5&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;basic&emsp;criteria&emsp;for&emsp;a&emsp;compensation&emsp;claim
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>a person who is jointly and severally liable for damage cannot therefore demand 
that his / her liability towards the injured party be reduced due to the fact that 
he / she contributed to the damage to a lesser degree than another joint and several 
debtor229. Unlike the Code of Obligations, which made joint and several liability 
dependent on damage being caused by several persons  jointly230, the Civil Code 
does not require a subjective connection between the concurrent tortfeasors231; 
it is enough that their conduct objectively contributed to the damage caused232. 
Since art 441 KC does not establish liability for intentional joint action, but rather 
joint and several liability of persons on whom tort law imposes liability for one 
and the same damage, a consideration of the problems analysed by Koziol under 
nos 5 / 73 and 5 / 74 of &raquo; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Germanic Perspective &laquo; 
seems irrelevant as far as Polish law is concerned.
</p>
<p>2.  Alternative causation
</p>
<p>a.  Joint and several liability versus freedom from liability in the case 
of several events which would trigger liability
</p>
<p>If a victim suffers damage that was caused either by event 1 or event 2, each attrib-
utable to a different perpetrator, and it cannot be established which of the events 
is in reality the cause, one view is that both perpetrators are liable jointly and sev-
erally. There is no equivalent of &sect; 830 ( 1 ) sent 2 BGB in the Polish Civil Code nor 
any other provisions dealing expressly with the issue of alternative causation ( or 
any other instance of uncertain causality ), so the question had to be settled by 
doctrine. According to Lewaszkiewicz-Petrykowska, joint and several liability is jus-
tified when the behaviour of several persons, acting jointly or separately, induces 
a dangerous situation, and the infliction of damage to a third party is the realisa-
tion of the danger induced233. Lewaszkiewicz-Petrykowska emphasises the existence 
of an adequate causal connection between the creation of a perilous situation 
</p>
<p>229 See, inter alia, SN judgment of 2.  12.  1970 ( II CR 542 / 70, OSNC no 9 / 1971, item 153 ); SN judgment 
of 25.  8.  1978 ( III CZP 48 / 78, OSNC no 4 / 1979, item 64 ). The fact that one tortfeasor contributed 
to the damage to a lesser degree than another is only of significance as far as recourse claims 
between the liable parties are concerned. In accordance with art 441 &sect; 2 KC, if the damage re-
sulted from the acts or omissions of several persons, the person who made good the damage 
may demand from the other persons the reimbursement of an adequate share depending on 
the circumstances, and in particular on the fault of a given person as well as the degree of 
his / her contribution to the occurrence of the damage.

<p>and the triggering of the damaging factor234. The chain of causation is therefore 
as follows: the perpetrators&rsquo; behaviour &ndash; a dangerous situation as a consequence 
of the perpetrators&rsquo; action &ndash; damage suffered by a third party as a realisation of 
the danger235. This approach is criticised by Kaliński, who points out that between 
the danger induction and the damage infliction an event occurs which can be at-
tributed only to one perpetrator and is the real cause of damage, and states that in 
cases where the existence of a causal connection has not been proven, one of the 
prerequisites of liability is missing236. Ohanowicz, G&oacute;rski and Czach&oacute;rski also hold 
that neither ( none ) of the alternative perpetrators can be held liable since a mere 
possibility of a causal link is not sufficient to establish liability237. Adopting the 
view advocated by Lewaszkiewicz-Petrykowska in fact means &ndash; although without an 
express admission that this is the case &ndash; accepting an attenuation of the causation 
requirement and regarding merely potential causation in the sense of conditio 
sine qua non as sufficient when a &raquo; dangerous situation &laquo; is created, ie when there 
is a high degree of specific risk238.
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has to date dealt with the problem of alternative causa-
tion of events justifying strict liability and held that the liability of potential tort-
feasors in such cases is joint and several239.
</p>
<p>As follows from the above, only all-or-nothing solutions of the problem of al-
ternative causation are currently supported in Poland. An adoption of the the-
ory of partial liability in proportion to the degree of likelihood of damage being 
caused by each of the potentially causal events would need an explicit acceptance 
of the concept of potential causation, which is not the case in Poland de lege lata. 
There is, however, a chance that this state of affairs will change as the concept of 
liability based on potential causation found support in the Commission for the 
Codification of Private Law and was introduced into a 2009 draft of the new civil 
code240.

<p>b.  Event which would trigger liability and &raquo; coincidence &laquo; as 
competing causes
</p>
<p>As  Koziol points out, the practically significant illustrations of the problem in 
question are provided by the field of medical malpractice241, where situations fre-
quently occur in which it is unclear whether damage resulted from such malprac-
tice or from the patient&rsquo;s medical predisposition. The approach of Polish courts 
to medical malpractice cases has been to mitigate the otherwise strict require-
ments with regard to causation242. The causal link in such cases does not need to 
be proven with certainty; a high degree of probability that the doctor&rsquo;s or hospi-
tal&rsquo;s faulty conduct caused the damage suffices243. Moreover, it is stressed that if 
there is negligence on the doctor&rsquo;s part, the proof that there are other factors that 
could possibly have caused the damage, or that the treatment posed increased 
risk due to the patient&rsquo;s condition, will not result in exemption from liability244. 
Also, the existence of an adequate causal connection between the negligent con-
duct and the damage may be established on the basis of a factual presumption 
pursuant to art 231 of the Code of Civil Procedure245, according to which the court 
may consider as established facts significant for the resolution of a case if such a 
conclusion can be drawn from other established facts246.
</p>
<p>The above solution is an all-or-nothing approach: if the court considers cau-
sation to be proven, the victim will be compensated, and if not, no damages will 
be awarded247. Unlike in Germany or Austria, there are no provisions introducing 
liability for potential causation in Polish law, so not even a starting point248 exists 
for adopting partial liability in proportion to the degree of likelihood of damage 
being caused by the perpetrator. The same is true for the injured party&rsquo;s contribu-
tion to the damage: based on art 362 KC, dealing with contributory responsibility 
( see no 3 / 140 ff below ), it would not be admissible to treat any circumstance on 
the victim&rsquo;s part as legally relevant and leading to a reduction of compensation if 
it was only potentially causal and if no causal link could be proven between this 
circumstance and the damage suffered. Another reason for the inapplicability of

<p>   Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>art 362 KC is that it only allows for a reduction of damages if what contributed to 
the harm was the injured party&rsquo;s conduct ( ie action or omission ), and not a circum-
stance on which he / she had no influence, such as eg an illness249.
</p>
<p>c.  The doctrine of loss of a chance as the better means  
to a solution ?
</p>
<p>The theory of loss of a chance is in principle not accepted in Polish law250. It is held 
that lost chance qualifies as &raquo; pr&eacute;judice &eacute;ventuel &laquo; and as such does not constitute 
compensable damage251. Two exceptions from this rule are indicated in the rele-
vant literature: one follows from art 444 &sect; 2 KC, pursuant to which compensation 
is due inter alia for the deterioration of  the victim&rsquo;s prospects  for  the  future result-
ing from bodily injury or a health disorder252, and the other finds its legal basis in 
art 446 &sect; 3 KC, which deals with damages awarded in the case of death of the pri-
mary victim, and which allows for the compensation of the loss of a chance to ob-
tain from the deceased the financial means of subsistence not covered by the duty 
to redress damage by way of an annuity within the framework of art 446 &sect; 2 KC253. 
Notwithstanding the doctrinal lack of approval for the discussed theory254, courts 
are known to employ the term &raquo; loss of a chance &laquo;, and to go on to award pecuni-
ary as well as non-pecuniary damages255. This concerns inter alia cases qualified 
as instances of &raquo; the loss of a chance of recovery &laquo;. For example, in a fairly recent 
decision the Supreme Court stated that &raquo; damage ( &hellip; ) may consist in the loss or re-
duction of a chance of being cured, as well as a reduction of a chance of a health im-
provement &laquo;256 ( emphasis KLR ), but at the same time held that such damage is com-
pensable by way of an annuity provided that it &raquo; expresses itself in one of the forms 
indicated in art 444 &sect; 2 KC &laquo;, that is, a complete or partial loss of working capacity, 
increased needs or diminished prospects for the future ( see no 3 / 162 below ) The

251 Instead of many see Dybowski in: Radwański, System Prawa Cywilnego 280.
252 It is emphasised that the deterioration of future prospects constitutes an independent basis 
</p>
<p>for the award of damages provided that it entails a limitation of earning capacity. An oft-cited 
example of such a situation is the disfigurement of the face of an actor; see inter alia Safjan in:

<p>case concerned the attending doctors&rsquo; failure to diagnose a baby&rsquo;s cerebral palsy 
as well as epilepsy257, which resulted in a delay in starting the necessary treatment, 
the effectiveness of which was estimated at twenty percent. It was established that 
an adequate causal connection existed between the delay in starting the treatment 
and the reduction of a chance that it would bring the desired results, and the Su-
preme Court stated that it would be inconsistent not to acknowledge that the de-
lay was also causally connected to the child&rsquo;s increased needs, manifesting them-
selves as the necessity to ( possibly ) incur higher expenses due to the greater extent 
of the treatment needed by him under the circumstances.
</p>
<p>As already indicated, Polish courts may deal with what they describe as &raquo; loss 
of a chance &laquo; by awarding non-pecuniary damages258. For example, in a judgment 
issued in January 1978 the Supreme Court held that the claimant&rsquo;s non-pecuniary 
loss embraced, among other things, an &raquo; extremely serious limitation of life oppor-
tunities &laquo; comprising inter alia the loss of a chance to have children resulting from 
her disability caused by medical malpractice259.
</p>
<p>d.  Alternative perpetrators and alternative victims &ndash; the theory of 
market share liability ?
</p>
<p>In cases referred to in this section we are again dealing with the problem of poten-
tial causation, although this time a different one: in the model &raquo; mountaineering &laquo; 
example given by Koziol260 it is certain that each of the perpetrators caused dam-
age, but causation by either of them cannot be proven in relation to any individual 
victim. Since each of the perpetrators has definitely caused damage, it does not 
seem fitting to argue for a &raquo; no liability &laquo; solution due to lack of a causal link ( al-
though from a strictly dogmatic point of view there are valid arguments for it as, in 
order to trigger liability, a causal connection in the sense of conditio sine qua non 
needs to be proven between a particular cause and a particular result, and in the 
case in question we cannot state that K1 would definitely not have suffered dam-
age if mountain climber B1 had not caused a stone to fall ). Since each perpetrator 
only caused damage to one victim, joint and several liability of both perpetrators 
towards both victims also seems out of place and not in line with art 441 KC, which 
requires that each of the perpetrators be liable for one and the same damage.
</p>
<p>If Polish courts were to deal with a case similar to the DES-cases, it seems un-
likely that they would reject the manufacturers&rsquo; liability, but at the same time it

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>is difficult to speculate what solution and what argumentation they would adopt. 
As for the market share theory, it may not &ndash; as Bagińska points out &ndash; be applied in 
Poland as it would be in violation of the only provision of the Civil Code that deals 
with causation &ndash; namely art 361 &sect; 1 KC261.
</p>
<p>3.  Cumulative causation
</p>
<p>Like in the Germanic systems, in cases of cumulative causation ( ie in situations 
where two real events take place simultaneously and both would have brought 
about the same damage on their own ) the perpetrators&rsquo; liability is assumed to 
be joint and several ( art 441 KC ). As Lewaszkiewicz-Petrykowska explains, in such 
cases a complete damaging act is committed by each of the perpetrators and both 
these acts are potentially causal ( both pose a risk of the damage that was actually 
inflicted ). She states that since the injured party could obtain compensation from 
each of the perpetrators as in both cases the court would have to assume the ex-
istence of a causal connection based on the high probability of such, and since 
the victim cannot possibly be compensated twice for one and the same damage, 
the only solution is joint and several liability262. A different approach is taken by 
Kaliński, who holds that in the cases in question the conditio sine qua non test 
should be modified and that it ought to be examined whether the damaging result 
would also have ensued in the absence of all the circumstances that accompany 
the event under consideration263. If the answer is affirmative, then the event must 
be regarded as causal for the result264.
</p>
<p>4.  Superseding causation
</p>
<p>According to the traditional and still prevailing view, the fact that damage would 
have otherwise been brought about by a second, later event, is to be disregarded 
( ie the first perpetrator is not to be exempted from liability if a subsequent event 
would have brought about the same damage )265; only real causation is therefore 
legally relevant266. This corresponds with the predominant view represented in 
Austria267. Szpunar, however, points out that one needs to take into account events 
</p>
<p>261  Bagińska in: Oliphant, Aggregation 314. Bagińska opts for joint and several liability of all tort-
feasors towards each of the victims.

</p>
<p>planned before damage infliction and gives as an example the destruction of a 
house that was to be demolished anyway268. A different view distinguishes between 
&raquo; direct &laquo; damage, ie harm caused to an existing object, the assessment of which 
does not change as a result of later events, and &raquo; indirect &laquo; damage, such as lucrum 
cessans or increased expenses. As regards the latter, subsequent events should be 
ignored if they take on the form of a misadventure which causes personal injury, 
but taken into account in the case of damage which entails the liability of another 
person or damage to property269. The dominant view with regard to misadventures 
as far as personal injuries are concerned is mirrored in SN judgment of 16 Febru-
ary 1965270, in which the Supreme Court held that an unfortunate random event 
( in this case the victim&rsquo;s going down with tuberculosis ), which alone would have 
caused the victim&rsquo;s disability, and which affected an already partially disabled per-
son, does not nullify the effects of the event which caused the partial disability. 
This is contrary to Bydlinski&rsquo;s view, shared by Koziol, that if the second event is a 
coincidence, it is the victim who must bear its consequences271. In the Polish lit-
erature such an approach is taken by Kaliński, who considers the case of a person 
losing two fingers as a result of a tort and then suffering from a stroke, the effect of 
which is a paralysis, and states that the stroke should release the tortfeasor from 
liability for the loss of working capacity caused by the loss of fingers272.
</p>
<p>The issue of superseding causation was recently dealt with in detail by Jastrzębski, 
who holds a view different from the hitherto predominant one, namely that the ad-
missibility of taking into account reserve causes ( Reserveursachen ) &ndash; and indeed a 
necessity to do so &ndash; is a simple consequence of adopting the difference theory as a 
method of damage calculation273. He points out that reducing the perpetrator&rsquo;s li-
ability as a result of a causa superveniens is nothing other than transferring to the 
injured party the risk that he / she would have been exposed to anyway ( ie irrespec-
tive of the first damaging event ). If, on the other hand, reserve causes were ignored, 
the hypothetical state of the victim&rsquo;s patrimony would be determined based only 
on events aggravating damage, which can hardly be justified274. Notwithstanding

<p>268  Szpunar, Ustalenie odszkodowania 43.
269  Dybowski in: Radwański, System Prawa Cywilnego 262. In this respect, Jastrzębski counters that 
</p>
<p>common sense speaks against regarding as a cause of damage entailing the liability of another 
person an event attributed to this person that would only have brought about the damage if 
the first event had not happened ( cf Basic Questions I, no 5 / 116 ); if, notwithstanding this il-
logicality, such an event were to be treated as a real cause, the problem in question would 
no longer be superseding causality but an issue of multiple causes instead;  Jastrzębski, KPP

</p>
<p>the above, Jastrzębski holds that certain subsequent events should not be taken into 
account; these are, firstly, reserve causes which would, if they had taken place, en-
tail the liability of a third party ( otherwise the injured party would have been de-
prived of compensation for damage caused in a way giving rise to liability since the 
third party could successfully defend him / herself by claiming that he / she did not 
cause damage since it was already inflicted ), and secondly, subsequent events in 
the case of damage calculated using the objective method. It must be mentioned 
here that Jastrzębski excludes from the notion of superseding causation subsequent 
events that actually &raquo; exerted influence &laquo; and &raquo; caused damage absorbing the harm 
caused previously &laquo;275. ( I have put the description in inverted commas as in my opin-
ion it is not accurate: subsequent damage cannot &raquo; absorb &laquo; earlier damage since 
the latter is already inflicted; it would therefore be more appropriate to talk about 
events that actually ensued and caused damage that would have absorbed the harm 
caused previously ), which Koziol treats as superseding causation, although at the 
same time admits, following Bydlinski,  that they are indeed ( as are all instances 
of superseding causation ) cases of cumulative causation stretched out chronolog-
ically276.  Jastrzębski categorises such situations as cases of multiple causes which 
result either in joint and several liability ( if damage is an indivisible result of sev-
eral causes, each of which justifies liability ), or in the exclusion of liability of the 
first perpetrator for any damage which results from the second event ( when the 
latter is nova causa interveniens )277. To illustrate the former, he gives an example 
of a case decided in France in the 1960s, concerning indivisible damage consist-
ing in the victim&rsquo;s complete incapacity to work, which resulted from two subse-
quent torts, each of which caused the victim to lose one eye278.  Jastrzębski holds 
that the notion of  superseding causation encompasses events &raquo; which do not in re-
ality join in the course of events &laquo; as they are &raquo; deprived of the possibility to take 
place or ( emphasis KLR ) exert influence by the ( initial &ndash; comment KLR ) cause &laquo;, and 
treats as &raquo; superseding causation  stricto sensu &laquo;  events that are purely hypotheti-
cal in that they never actually  occur  279. His classification is therefore different to 
Koziol&rsquo;s, who considers as cases of superseding causation only events that actually 
took place280 and classifies lawful alternative behaviour, treated by Jastrzębski as an 
example of superseding causation281, as a separate, albeit related, phenomenon.

<p>To conclude the remarks above, it should be noted that the Supreme Court has 
recently issued several decisions in which it expressed a view diverging from the 
hitherto prevailing one and considered taking causa superveniens  into account 
as in principle admissible282. A reserve cause was regarded as a factor limiting or 
excluding liability in a judgment of 2 March 2006283, which concerned the follow-
ing situation: the claimants&rsquo; legal predecessors were unlawfully refused, inter alia, 
the right of ( temporary ) ownership of an immovable. Several years later the real 
property in question was transferred to a housing association. The Court stated 
that had the claimants&rsquo; predecessors been treated in accordance with the law and 
granted ownership, they would have been necessarily subject to expropriation 
( due to the fact that the property was destined to be transferred to the housing as-
sociation ) and would have received appropriate compensation. In consequence, it 
was held that the claimants&rsquo; damage does not consist in the loss of property, but 
in the non-receipt of appropriate compensation. The circumstance that the claim-
ants&rsquo; predecessors would have been expropriated was therefore treated as a factor 
influencing the amount of damages. The judgment was criticised for taking into 
account a reserve cause when the certainty of its occurrence might have given rise 
to serious doubts284. Causa superveniens was also treated as a factor influencing 
the extent of damage in a decision of 29 April 2010285.
</p>
<p>Another judgment worth mentioning here, issued in January 2005286, concerns 
the issue of lawful alternative behaviour. In the judgment, the Supreme Court ex-
pressed its approval of the view according to which reserve causes should in prin-
ciple be taken into account, although with certain exceptions to this rule287, one 
of which applied precisely to the facts of the case decided. The Court held that the 
perpetrator cannot rely on the fact that the injured party would have suffered the 
same damage as a result of his subsequent alternative lawful behaviour if the per-
petrator&rsquo;s actual conduct violated a norm intended to prevent such damage288 ( for de-
tails see no 3 / 152 below ). It has been inferred from the judgment conclusion that 
lawful alternative behaviour can be taken into account if the infringed norm was 
not meant to prevent the harm that was inflicted by the unlawful conduct289.

<p>In a judgment of 29 April 2010290, the Supreme Court listed conditions that 
must be fulfilled in order for a causa superveniens to be taken into account: the 
supervening cause must be a link in a parallel, hypothetical chain of causation, 
independent of the actual sequence of events; the damaging event must not have 
created an opportunity for the hypothetical cause to occur ( since the occurrence 
of the latter is prevented by the former ); the injured party must prove that the oc-
currence of the supervening cause in the absence of the damaging event would 
have been almost certain291.

<p> Part 6 The elements of liability
</p>
<p>I.  Wrongfulness
A.  The concept of wrongfulness
</p>
<p>As in most legal systems, wrongfulness ( in Polish law and doctrine the term 
&raquo; bezprawność &laquo; [ literally: &raquo; unlawfulness &laquo; ] is used )292 is in principle significant in 
the area of fault-based liability293, although it is also the prerequisite of liability for 
the exercise of public authority ( arts 417 ff KC ), which since 2004294 is independent 
of fault295. A new principle of liability has even been distinguished in this context 
( next to fault, risk and equity ), namely that of unlawfulness, although the neces-
sity of this distinction has been questioned296.
</p>
<p>Wrongfulness is not mentioned explicitly in art 415 KC, pursuant to which 
&raquo; any person who by his fault has caused damage to another person is obliged to 
redress it &laquo;297. According to the traditional view, it constitutes an objective element 
of fault298, but many authors regard it as a prerequisite of fault ( see also no 3 / 110 
below )299. While there is no unanimity as to the legal qualification of wrongful-
</p>
<p>292 On the concept of wrongfulness in Polish law, see also G. Żmij, Wrongfulness as a liability&rsquo;s 
prerequisite in art 415 Polish Civil Code, in: B. Heiderhoff / G. Żmij ( eds ), Tort Law in Poland, 
Germany and Europe ( 2009 ) 13 ff.
</p>
<p>293 It is therefore irrelevant in the field of strict liability; see, inter alia, Kaliński in: Olejniczak, Sys-
tem Prawa Prywatnego 60; Olejniczak in: Kidyba, Kodeks cywilny, commentary to art 435, no 15;

</p>
<p>294 For more on the modified rules governing liability for the exercise of public authority see 
Bagińska in: Koziol / Steininger, European Tort Law 2004, 462 ff.
</p>
<p>295 It must be noted that rather than employ the term unlawful ( bezprawny ), which is used in several other 
Civil Code provisions ( inter alia, art 24, art 423 KC ), the legislator opted for the constitutional expres-
sion incompatible with the law ( niezgodny z prawem ) in art 417 KC. This has resulted in two diverging 
interpretations of this prerequisite of liability for the exercise of public authority ( see no 3 / 97 below ).

fulness ) is a necessary condition of fault-based liability, and not a separate form of fault or a 
component of fault &laquo;. Warkałło&rsquo;s statement refers to an old and no longer supported theory 
proclaimed by R. Longchamps de Berier, according to which fault consisted of two components: 
objective fault and subjective fault, and which the judgment of 7.  4.  1962 adopts.

</p>
<p>ness, the need to single it out as a prerequisite of fault-based liability is not ques-
tioned300. The crux of the concept is the relationship between human behaviour 
and a rule laid down by the legal system301. In the area of fault-based liability, 
&raquo; bezprawność &laquo; is understood broadly302, ie not only as an infringement of this 
legal provision or the other, but also as a violation of the &raquo; principles of commu-
nity life &laquo;303, whereas in the field of liability for the exercise of public authority, two 
views are presented: one favours the &raquo; traditional &laquo;, broad understanding304, while 
the other supports a narrow concept of wrongfulness ( ie &raquo;  bezprawność &laquo; as a vio-
lation of a legal provision )305.
</p>
<p>There is some confusion as to whether due care necessary to avoid causing 
damage to others should be included in the concept of wrongfulness. Such care &ndash; 
assessed according to an objective standard ( see no 3 / 118 below ) &ndash; is generally 
treated as linked with fault in the &raquo; strict sense &laquo;306, although it has also been con-
vincingly argued that it is associated with wrongfulness307.
</p>
<p>It follows from the above that the Polish theory of wrongfulness qualifies as 
Verhaltensunrechtslehre ( theory of wrongfulness of conduct )308. It is, however, also 
</p>
<p>300 Wrongfulness has also been defined as &raquo; objective inappropriateness &laquo; of human conduct;

<p>217Part 6&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;elements&emsp;of&emsp;liability
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>argued that if an absolutely protected right is infringed by a given conduct, the con-
duct will be classified as unlawful, which seems at first glance to mirror the Erfolgs-
unrechtslehre ( theory of wrongfulness established by the result ), but is justified in 
line with the Verhaltensunrechtslehre concept: it is submitted that the conduct in 
question violates a norm addressed to the general public which prohibits such inter-
ferences309.310 In accordance with this view, an omission violating an absolutely pro-
tected right will only be deemed unlawful if there is a duty to act of a general ( uni-
versal ) character311. It is emphasised that an omission is only unlawful if it infringes 
a duty to act imposed by statute, and not by the &raquo; principles of community life &laquo;312.
</p>
<p>Wrongfulness alone is in principle not enough to justify liability for damage, 
but it suffices to trigger preventive and reparative injunctions as well as rights 
to act in self-defence. Wrongful but not faulty behaviour may lead to liability in 
combination with other factors. For example, children and the mentally ill may 
be fully or partially liable for the damage caused provided that they acted unlaw-
fully and that their liability is justified under consideration of the economic cir-
cumstances ( see no 3 / 136 below ). Also, the wrongfulness of conduct of auxiliaries 
as well as that of children and the mentally ill is a prerequisite for the liability of 
respectively the entrusting and the supervising persons ( see nos 3 / 120 and 3 / 124 ).
</p>
<p>B.  Protection against insignificant infringements ?
</p>
<p>Polish law does not contain an explicit general rule stating that no compensation 
should be awarded for trivial damage, but the concept of a significance threshold 
is known to it both in the field of pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss. As for non-
pecuniary loss, a refusal of compensation is regarded as justified if objectively 
verifiable criteria indicate the triviality of the damage suffered ( see also no 3 / 64 
above )313. Such a general significance threshold has not been accepted in the field 
</p>
<p>309 Although, as rightly pointed out by Koziol, not all infringements are prohibited; minor viola-
tions must be tolerated ( see Basic Questions I, no 6 / 8 ).

<p>312 Due to the fact that the principles of community life do not sufficiently specify the extent of 
the duty to act or the person burdened with such a duty. See  Banaszczyk  in: Pietrzykowski, 
Kodeks cywilny 1559. A different view, according to which the unlawfulness of an omission 
may consist in an infringement of the principles of community life, has, however, also been

<p>of pecuniary damage, which should as a rule be compensated in full, independent 
of its extent. An exception stemming from EU law is foreseen by provisions regu-
lating product liability: art 449 7 &sect; 2 KC stipulates a &euro; 500 threshold in cases of dam-
age to property. In the law of neighbours, art 144 KC provides that in the course 
of exercising his right, &raquo; the owner of an immovable should refrain from actions 
which would interfere with the use of neighbouring immovables over and above 
an &raquo; average degree &laquo;, determined in accordance with the social and economic pur-
pose of the immovable as well as the local circumstances. &laquo; The owners of neigh-
bouring immovables must therefore tolerate emissions not exceeding the said 
&raquo; average degree &laquo;, such emissions not being wrongful.
</p>
<p>C.  Protection of pure economic interests
</p>
<p>According to  Pajor,  there is no hierarchy of legally protected interests in Polish 
law and therefore, in accordance with the principle of full restitution expressed in 
art 361 &sect; 2 KC, as a rule &raquo; every instance of material damage is subject to compensa-
tion, including pure economic loss &laquo;314. It is only by way of exception that the scope 
of tortious protection is explicitly restricted to injury to the person or damage to prop-
erty315, which allows the conclusion that pure economic loss, ie financial loss not re-
sulting from physical injury to the claimant&rsquo;s own person or property316, is in princi-
ple not excluded from the scope of the duty to compensate and should be redressed, 
provided of course that it remains within the boundaries of adequacy ( art 361 &sect; 1 
KC )317. Apart from the criterion of adequacy, the compensability of such loss is also 
restricted by the principle, accepted by the majority of scholars and supported by 
case law, that Polish tort law only allows for the compensation of losses suffered by 
a direct victim, ie by the person against whom the damage-triggering event was di-
rected318; this principle is regarded as our system&rsquo;s way of &raquo; keeping the floodgates 
</p>
<p>possible in order to prevent damage and alleviate the discomfort, as in such a case equity con-
siderations do not require making good the damage by means of monetary compensation.

<p>219Part 6&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;elements&emsp;of&emsp;liability
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>shut &laquo;319. Art 446 KC, which entitles several categories of &raquo; indirectly aggrieved &laquo;320 
persons to compensation for their own losses resulting from the primary victim&rsquo;s 
death321, is regarded as an exception confirming the rule that damages may only be 
awarded to primary victims. The correctness of the view that Polish tort law regards 
as compensable solely losses suffered by persons against whom the damage-trig-
gering event was directed has, however, been convincingly questioned322.
</p>
<p>Bagińska and Nesterowicz state that pure economic loss will be compensated 
when it falls within the category of lost profits323.
</p>
<p>Pure economic interests are protected within the framework of culpa in contra-
hendo: a culpable infringement of pre-contractual rules of conduct will trigger a duty 
to redress damage resulting from the fact that the intended contract was not con-
cluded or turned out to be void, such damage consisting in the costs incurred by the 
person expecting the conclusion and &ndash; although this is not universally accepted &ndash; prof-
its lost by this person ( mainly profits connected with a different contract that he / she 
did not conclude because he / she was expecting the first contract to take effect )324.
</p>
<p>As for delictual protection of contracts, which are an instrument for creat-
ing and protecting pure economic interests325, it is generally accepted that an in-
fringement of a contractual relationship by a third party may under certain cir-
cumstances trigger the latter&rsquo;s delictual liability. It is also convincingly argued 
that such liability will only arise in cases of third-party conduct directed at causing 
damage to the obligee, as such conduct must be considered wrongful due to the 
fact that it is contrary to the &raquo; principles of community life &laquo;. Grzybowski merely 
requires that the conduct in question is faulty326, but Machnikowski persuasively 
argues that a negligent disregarding of a contract is not sufficient and that only 
intentional infringements are relevant327.

</p>
<p>As in many other legal systems, surviving dependants are granted their own 
claim for compensation for the loss of maintenance in the case of death of the pri-
mary victim ( art 446 &sect; 2 KC ). They may also demand compensation for other eco-
nomic losses which are not susceptible to precise measurement ( art 446 &sect; 3 KC )328.
</p>
<p>If pure economic loss is caused intentionally, liability must in my opinion be 
regarded as justified because, firstly, the criterion of adequacy does not restrict 
the extent of compensation in such cases ( see no 3 / 114 below ), and secondly, since 
the perpetrator&rsquo;s conduct is directed against the person suffering the loss, liability 
will not be excluded by the principle that Polish tort law only allows for the com-
pensation of losses suffered by a direct victim ( see no 3 / 102 ).
</p>
<p>II.  Fault
</p>
<p>A.  Concept, prerequisites and meaning
</p>
<p>It holds true for Polish law that strict liability has gained so much significance 
over the years that it is equal in status to fault-based liability329; one can therefore 
speak of a two-lane nature of liability330.
</p>
<p>Fault has not been defined by the Polish legislator, and scholarly deliberations 
on this concept have been influenced by the doctrine of criminal law. Formerly, 
fault was defined as the perpetrator&rsquo;s incorrect mental attitude towards his / her 
deed ( a so-called &raquo; psychological concept &laquo; )331, but this theory has largely been aban-
doned, and at the moment a so-called &raquo; normative concept &laquo; prevails, according 
to which, broadly speaking, fault can be attributed to a person if the said person 
might be  censured  for his / her misconduct which led to damage. Fault therefore 
boils down to &raquo; censurability &laquo; ( blameworthiness )332. The adoption of the norma-
tive concept leads to the blurring of boundaries between wrongfulness and fault333.
</p>
<p>Since wrongfulness is not explicitly mentioned in art 415 KC, the traditional 
view is that it constitutes an objective element of fault, and that therefore fault 
consists of two components: objective ( wrongfulness ) and subjective ( sometimes

<p>defined as fault  sensu stricto ) 334. Another view has, however, gained considera-
ble support in recent decades, distinguishing wrongfulness from fault and treat-
ing the former as the prerequisite for the latter; eg according to Lewaszkiewicz-Pe-
trykowska, fault is &raquo; a negative evaluation of a person&rsquo;s conduct, consisting in the 
possibility to censure the said person based on the analysis of his / her conduct 
and a norm in force &laquo;335, while Radwański defines it as &raquo; a censurable decision of a 
person concerning his / her wrongful conduct &laquo;336.
</p>
<p>There are diverging views as to whether fault refers only to the perpetrator&rsquo;s 
conduct ( ie whether only the conduct needs to be faulty )337, or also to the damag-
ing result338. The former offers a more sensible solution from the point of view of 
the injured party: since the perpetrator is liable for the damaging results of his 
censurable conduct even if he did not want them, or did not and could not foresee 
them, it is easier for the victim to prove fault.
</p>
<p>Fault can only be attributed to persons who are sane and mentally mature. The 
capacity for fault under Polish tort law arises upon the completion of the thirteenth 
year of life ( art 426 KC ). This is a rigid boundary, which excludes examining the 
powers of discernment of persons below thirteen years of age. Persons aged thir-
teen and older may be considered incapable of acting culpably due to insanity339. In 
accordance with art 425 KC, &raquo; a person who for whatever reason is in a state which 
prevents him from making a conscious or free decision and from expressing his 
will is not liable for damage caused when in such a state &laquo; ( &sect; 1 ); &raquo; however, a person 
who has been subjected to a disturbance of mental functions due to the use of in-
toxicating beverages or other similar substances is obliged to redress the damage, 
unless the state of disturbance was caused through no fault of his own &laquo; ( &sect; 2 )340.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Similarly to German and Austrian law, persons incapable of committing fault 
may still be held liable on the basis of equity ( art 428 KC; see no 3 / 136 below ).
</p>
<p>Every form of fault and even the slightest degree of it triggers liability un-
der Polish tort law341. Only exceptionally is responsibility restricted to instances 
of qualified fault ( for example, an instigator, a person who consciously benefited 
from damage inflicted to another and &ndash; according to the prevailing view &ndash; an abet-
tor are only liable for intent342; art 422 KC343 ). Another question is whether the de-
gree of fault may influence the extent of liability, and in particular whether serious 
fault may justify transgressing the boundaries of adequacy and attributing to the 
perpetrator responsibility for the consequences of his conduct which cannot be 
considered normal. In principle, the tortfeasor is only liable for the normal con-
sequences of his behaviour irrespective of the degree of fault ( art 361 &sect; 1 KC ), but 
a deviation from this rule is accepted in cases of intention: it is argued that if the 
perpetrator&rsquo;s intent embraces abnormal consequences, so should his liability344.
</p>
<p>The degree of the tortfeasor&rsquo;s fault may influence the extent of compensable 
non-pecuniary loss suffered by the victim345 as well as play a role when deciding 
on the reduction of the duty to compensate in cases of the victim&rsquo;s contributory 
conduct ( see no 3 / 143 below ).
</p>
<p>In the case of intent, the perpetrator either wants to behave wrongfully or con-
sciously accepts such possibility346, or, alternatively ( see no 3 / 111 above on the di-
verging views on whether fault concerns the perpetrator&rsquo;s conduct or the damag-
ing result ), either wants to cause damage through his / her wrongful behaviour, or 
consciously accepts such possibility347.
</p>
<p>Non-intentional fault in Polish private law centres on the concept of  nie-
dbalstwo  ( negligence )348. It is indicated in the relevant literature that guidance 
on how negligence should be assessed is to be found in art 355 KC, which states :

</p>
<p>&raquo; ( &sect; 1 ) The debtor is obliged to exercise diligence which is generally required in the 
relations of a given type ( due diligence ). ( &sect; 2 ) The debtor&rsquo;s due diligence in the 
field of his economic activity is determined taking into account the professional 
character of that activity. &laquo; Although said provision expressly refers to a debtor, it 
has been accepted both by courts349 and scholars350 that it also applies to extra-
contractual relations.
</p>
<p>B.  Subjective or objective assessment of fault ?
</p>
<p>As in Austria and Germany, due diligence ( due care ), is assessed by reference to 
objectivised patterns of ( due; diligent; careful ) behaviour351 and the standard of 
diligence is higher for professionals. The perpetrator&rsquo;s act is set against the pat-
tern of behaviour of a diligent person acting under the same circumstances ( in 
the same situation )352; it goes without saying that such an assessment blurs the 
boundaries between fault and unlawfulness353. Several authors rightly stress that a 
divergence from an objectivised pattern of behaviour is not tantamount to fault354 
and that only a perpetrator who could have behaved carefully under the circum-
stances is at fault355. It follows from the above that apart from setting the perpetra-
tor&rsquo;s behaviour against a certain standard, one must take into account the circum-
stances under which such a divergence occurred356. A person will therefore not be 
at fault if it was physically impossible for him / her to comply with the standard, 
and he / she might not be deemed negligent if he / she was misinformed or threat-
ened357. It is disputed whether, and to what extent, personal characteristics of the

</p>
<p>damaging party should be taken into consideration358. Machnikowski convincingly 
argues that account should only be taken of characteristics that have a significant 
impact on the perpetrator&rsquo;s behaviour and at the same time are permanent in 
character or easily discernible ( age, visible mental or physical disability, visible 
illness )359. It seems, however, that individual traits should not be taken into con-
sideration in the case of professionals. As Koziol rightly points out, anyone who 
exercises an activity requiring special knowledge and powers of reasoning despite 
lacking the relevant ability creates a source of special danger by so doing also for 
third parties360, which justifies the objectivisation of liability.
</p>
<p>As has been pointed out, the boundary between unlawfulness and negligence 
is somewhat blurred in Polish tort law, mainly due to the fact that the attribution 
of negligence relies heavily on objective criteria; Safjan even speaks of &raquo; far-reach-
ing objectivisation &laquo; of fault  361. Courts tend to assume negligence based merely on 
the fact that certain duties have been breached, especially in the case of profes-
sionals362. It is, however, beyond doubt that a ) only objective criteria are relevant 
when assessing unlawfulness, b ) only unlawful behaviour can be negligent, and  
c ) not all unlawful behaviour is simultaneously negligent.
</p>
<p>358 In its decision of 15.  2.  1971 ( III CZP 33 / 70 ) the Supreme Court ( SN ) stated that personal physical 
or mental characteristics of the perpetrator should not be taken into account when assessing 
negligence.

</p>
<p>III.  Other defects in the damaging party&rsquo;s own sphere
</p>
<p>A.  Misconduct of persons
</p>
<p>The Civil Code contains special provisions regulating tortious liability for auxilia-
ries ( arts 429 and 430 KC ) as well as liability for minors under thirteen years of age 
and for adults incapable of committing fault ( art 427 KC ). Liability for others is ei-
ther based on risk ( art 430 KC ) or on presumed fault ( culpa in eligendo, art 429 KC, 
or culpa in custodiendo, art 427 KC ). What is common to all the listed instances of 
liability is that responsibility cannot be triggered by the conduct of another per-
son which is not unlawful; this is in line with the rule that the victim does not in 
principle enjoy any protection against such conduct363.
</p>
<p>As in Austrian and German law364, liability for damage caused by children365 is 
only imposed on parents and other supervising persons for their own fault. In the 
case of minors under thirteen years of age, art 427 KC introduces a presumption 
of fault in supervision, as well as of the existence of a causal connection between 
the improper exercise of supervision and the damage infliction366. As mentioned 
above, in order for the supervising persons&rsquo; liability to arise, the minor&rsquo;s con-
duct must be unlawful367. If the supervised child has reached the age of thirteen, 
the parents&rsquo; ( supervising persons&rsquo; ) responsibility is based on the general rule of 
art 415 KC, which means that there is no reversal of the burden of proof and the 
victim needs to prove all the prerequisites for liability. Liability for damage caused 
by adults incapable of committing fault due to their mental or physical state is 
such as for children under the age of thirteen ( art 427 KC ).
</p>
<p>Before tortious liability for auxiliaries is looked into in more detail, it is worth 
casting a glance at liability for performance agents ( Erf&uuml;llungsgehilfen ), which &ndash; like 
in other legal systems &ndash; is far-reaching. Art 474 KC introduces strict liability of the 
debtor for the acts and omissions of persons who assist him in performing the ob-
ligation as well as the persons to whom he entrusts the performance of the obliga-
tion. To be precise, the debtor is liable &raquo; as for his own actions or omissions &laquo;, ie ir-
respective of his own fault, but, since contractual liability in Polish law is generally 
for the lack of due diligence ( art 471 KC in conjunction with art 472 KC &ndash; see no 3 / 55 
above ), responsibility under art 474 KC will in principle arise when there is fault 
consisting in the failure to apply such diligence on the part of the Erf&uuml;llungsgehilfe.

<p>   Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Tortious liability for persons entrusted with the performance of a task is ei-
ther based on presumed fault in selection ( art 429 KC ), or is strict ( art 430 KC ). Al-
though it is pointed out that the meaning of the term &raquo; fault &laquo; used in art 429 KC is 
the same as under art 415 KC368, a view has also been expressed that &raquo; fault in se-
lection &laquo; as a basis for liability for auxiliaries differs from &raquo; fault &laquo; as mentioned in 
art 415 KC since selection cannot be unlawful in the traditional sense; it can only 
be incorrect, meaning that a person who is not appropriate to perform a given task 
has been chosen. Fault in selection therefore consists of two elements: an error in 
selection and a negative assessment of the selecting person&rsquo;s conduct ( a possibil-

<p>In order for the entrusting person&rsquo;s liability based on art 429 KC to arise, the 
auxiliary&rsquo;s conduct must be unlawful370. To rebut the presumption of fault in se-
lection, the said person needs to prove either that there is no such fault on his / her 
part ( ie that he / she applied due diligence when appointing the auxiliary ), or al-
ternatively that he / she entrusted the performance of a task to a person, an enter-
prise or an institution that deals with performing such tasks within the limits of 
their professional activity371. The latter option makes it relatively easy to free one-
self from liability372. Although the wording of art 429 KC suggests its applicability 
to all instances of entrusting another with the performance of a task, in reality it 
only applies to cases not covered by art 430 KC373. Unlike art 429 KC, art 430 KC in-
troduces liability independent of the entrusting person&rsquo;s fault ( strict liability ), but 
dependent on the fault of the auxiliary. It applies solely to cases of damage caused 
by persons &raquo; subject to the supervision of the entrusting person and obliged to 
abide by his / her guidelines &laquo; ( dependent auxiliaries; subordinates ) and provided 
that the task has been entrusted on the principal&rsquo;s own account. The relationship 
between art 429 KC and art 430 KC is one of lex generalis versus lex specialis. This 
means that if all the prerequisites for the application of the latter are fulfilled, the 
former is not applicable and that, consequently, liability under art 429 KC may 
arise either in the absence of the relationship of subordination, or when fault can-

<p>not be attributed to the subordinate374. The practical significance of art 429 KC 
follows mainly from its applicability to cases of independent performance by an-
other375.The solution provided for by art 430 KC is different from those introduced 
by the ABGB or by the Austrian Draft376, but the idea of liability being triggered 
only if there is a serious defect in the principal&rsquo;s sphere is no doubt present there 
as well in the form of the prerequisite of the auxiliary&rsquo;s fault. This prerequisite 
also means that the auxiliary and the principal are jointly and severally liable to-
wards the victim, although an exception to this rule is established in the practi-
cally very significant field of employee liability: according to art 120 KP, if an em-
ployee causes damage to a third party in the course of exercising his / her duties, it 
is the employer alone who is liable to compensate it377. Moreover, unless intentional 
fault can be attributed to the employee, the employer&rsquo;s recourse against the em-
ployee is limited to three times the latter&rsquo;s monthly salary ( art 119 KP ). Since sub-
ordination within the meaning of art 430 is understood broadly ( ie as subordina-
tion in a general sense, and not as giving actual indications / guidelines )378, art 430 
KC has a wide scope of application and is a provision of great practical importance. 
To give just one example, professionals from whom creative action is expected and 
who are independent to a sizeable extent, such as doctors, are also considered to 
be subordinates within the meaning of art 430 KC379. The concept of strict liability 
for the dependent auxiliary&rsquo;s faulty conduct has been in force in Poland for dec-
ades and there are no realistic prospects for a change in the law. The idea that the 
principal&rsquo;s liability should generally be based on fault in selection or supervision 
and that no-fault liability is only justified in cases of deploying an  incompetent 
auxiliary380 is unlikely to meet with support in Poland. The reasoning behind this 
idea is that the auxiliary&rsquo;s lack of aptitude creates a special source of danger and 
therefore liability without fault is reasonable381. The question is, is creating such a 
special source of danger necessary in order to justify the principal&rsquo;s strict liability ?

</p>
<p>It is beyond doubt that the fact alone that someone deployed another person in 
their own interest cannot provide a sufficient basis to burden the principal with 
all damage caused in the course of performance of the entrusted task; in my opin-
ion it should, however, suffice to make him liable for damage caused culpably as 
then the prerequisite of a serious defect within his sphere is met. It seems rea-
sonable that if one deploys another person to perform a task on one&rsquo;s account and 
under one&rsquo;s influence, then one should bear the risk of that person acting in a way 
that generates liability for damage irrespective of whether he / she can be labelled 
as incompetent ( and thus constituting a source of danger ). What should matter is 
that the auxiliary caused damage in a culpable way, even if he / she can be described 
as generally competent ( suitable ). Why should the injured party bear the risk of 
an otherwise competent auxiliary acting culpably, and why should the principal 
be free from liability for such faulty conduct if it is him / her who deployed the 
auxiliary, is able to control him and moreover profits from his / her activities ? To 
this one could counter that the victim could always claim compensation from the 
auxiliary him / herself. It is no doubt true, but why should he / she be deprived of 
the chance to direct his / her claims against another debtor, who initiated the auxil-
iary&rsquo;s performance which resulted in the damage, and who is usually better off fi-
nancially ? This seems reasonable especially when, as in Poland, the principal who 
compensated the victim can claim the damages back from the auxiliary.
</p>
<p>Both on the basis of art 429 KC and art 430 KC, the entrusting person is only 
liable if damage was caused in the course of the performance. The interpretation 
of this concept causes considerable difficulties. It is emphasised that no liabil-
ity will arise if harm was inflicted only on the occasion of the performance382, that 
there must be a functional connection between the performance and the damage 
infliction383, or that liability is only triggered by conduct undertaken in order to ac-
complish the entrusted task384. Despite the application of these criteria, however, 
certain doubts remain as to whether liability should be accepted or rejected in 
borderline cases.
</p>
<p>B.  Defective things
</p>
<p>The defective condition of a thing is significant in the case of several instances of 
strict liability. Apart from the provisions on product liability ( arts 449 1 ff KC ), two 
other contexts are worth mentioning in this respect: art 434 KC, which regulates

<p>liability for damage caused by the collapse of a building or the detachment of part 
of it, as well as arts 435 and 436 KC, concerning respectively the liability of a person 
running on his own account an enterprise or business set in operation by natural 
forces and the liability of the possessor of a motor vehicle ( or, to be more precise, 
of a &raquo; mechanical means of transport propelled by natural forces &laquo;385 ). Art 434 KC 
introduces no-fault liability of the possessor of a building for the failure to main-
tain the building in a proper state as well as for a defect in its construction, and in-
troduces a presumption that damage resulted from these circumstances. Art 436 
KC regulates strict liability of the vehicle possessor, which is only excluded &ndash; in 
accordance with art 435 KC, to which art 436 KC refers &ndash; when damage was caused 
by force majeure, exclusively by the fault of the injured party or exclusively by the 
fault of a third party for whom the vehicle possessor is not liable. As far as force 
majeure is concerned, an objective theory has been adopted in Poland, in accord-
ance with which the concept only encompasses external events386; this rules out 
defects in a vehicle as excluding the possessor&rsquo;s liability towards the victim. It is 
universally accepted that all such defects are part of the possessor&rsquo;s risk, ie that 
he / she cannot free her / himself from liability for these towards the victim387 even if 
they are culpably caused by a third party ( although of course in the latter case the 
possessor has a right of recourse against the person liable for the defect ). These 
remarks also pertain to the liability of a person running an enterprise set in opera-
tion by natural forces ( including, eg, a railway undertaking ): failings &raquo; internal &laquo; to 
the enterprise, including defects in machinery or equipment, will not result in the 
exclusion of liability based on art 435 KC388.
</p>
<p>IV.  Dangerousness
</p>
<p>Dangerousness is an important criterion of imputation, although not one explic-
itly invoked in any of the provisions establishing strict liability, and also not the 
only criterion justifying such liability. Polish law does not use the term &raquo; liabil-
ity for dangerousness &laquo;. Responsibility based on dangerousness as a criterion for

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>imputation is either described as liability based on risk ( odpowiedzialność na zasa-
dzie ryzyka ), or absolute liability ( odpowiedzialność absolutna )389.
</p>
<p>There is no general rule on liability for dangerousness, but individual regula-
tions establishing it instead, and the meaning of &raquo; dangerousness &laquo; or &raquo; increased 
dangerousness &laquo; underlying no-fault liability &ndash; or, to be more precise, factors deci-
sive for the recognition of increased dangerousness as a ground for liability &ndash; may 
differ from one instance of liability to another. For example, in the case of art 436 
KC, which regulates the liability of the possessor of a motor vehicle, increased 
dangerousness results mostly from the likelihood of damage infliction390; as far as 
art 433 KC is concerned, which deals with liability for the ejection, effusion or fall-
ing of any object from the premises, it is not the likelihood of damage &ndash; after all, 
unlike traffic accidents, incidents involving things falling from buildings do not 
happen on a daily basis &ndash; but the severity of harm which may possibly be caused 
by things dropping from a certain height391; in the case of damage caused by the 
use of nuclear energy ( arts 100 ff of the Atomic Energy Law392 ), what matters is not 
the likelihood ( the probability of nuclear damage is minor ), but the extent and se-
verity of possible harm393.
</p>
<p>The closest that Polish law comes to a general clause in the area of strict li-
ability is art 435 KC394, which is the equivalent of art 152 KZ, and which does not, as 
already indicated, expressly refer to increased danger as a ground for imputation, 
but binds liability to the use of natural forces395. A broad interpretation of art 435 
based on the wording of this provision has led to the expansion of strict liability 
and to art 435 being applied also in situations where the occurrence of damage 
does not result from increased danger; a good example is the slipping of a passen-
</p>
<p>389 As Łopuski rightly points out, the term absolute ( as opposed to risk-based ) may only be accepted 
in the case of liability which cannot be excluded ( Łopuski, KPP no 3 / 2004, 676 ); it cannot there-
fore be used with regard to any of the instances of strict liability described below.

394 Art 435 &sect; 1 A person conducting on his own account an enterprise or business set into opera-

<p>tion by natural forces ( steam, gas, electricity, liquid fuel, etc ) is liable for any damage to per-
sons or property caused through the operation of the enterprise or business, unless the dam-

person for whom he is not liable. &sect; 2 The above provision shall apply correspondingly to enter-
prises or businesses producing or using explosives ( translation by Bagińska in: Oliphant / Stein-
inger, Basic Texts 196 ).
</p>
<p>395 In order for liability to arise there must be a causal connection between the damage and the 
functioning of the enterprise as a whole; a direct relationship between the use of natural 
forces and the harm caused is not necessary; see, inter alia, Safjan in: Pietrzykowski, Kodeks

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>ger on a platform396. Łopuski critically evaluates the reference to the use of natural 
forces as a criterion justifying no-fault liability and points out that, currently, hu-
man activities generating danger go far beyond those specified in art 435 KC397. He 
is in favour of introducing a direct reference to danger, and more precisely to de-
vices or technologies creating danger in art 435 KC398.
</p>
<p>The defences to liability for dangerousness known to Polish tort law are: force 
majeure, the fault of the injured party which is the exclusive cause of damage as 
well as the fault of a third party which is the exclusive cause of damage. All three 
and solely these three operate as circumstances exempting from liability based on 
art 433 KC, art 435 KC and art 436 KC. In the case of art 434, the catalogue of exoner-
ating circumstances is broader and undefined: since the possessor is liable solely 
for the failure to maintain the building in a proper state and for a construction 
defect ( or, to put it differently, since his strict liability is limited to the two circum-
stances ), he will be exonerated not only if he proves that damage was caused by 
force majeure, exclusively by the fault of the injured party or exclusively by the fault 
of a third party, but also if he manages to demonstrate that it resulted from any 
other cause for which he is not liable399. Liability for nuclear damage is stricter as 
it is only excluded if there is intentional fault on the part of the victim or if damage 
is caused by a special instance of force majeure, namely warfare or armed conflict.
</p>
<p>Contributory responsibility of the victim is a defence leading to the reduction 
of damages also in the area of risk-based liability ( see no 3 / 140 ff below ).
</p>
<p>The injured party&rsquo;s consent will by no means always lead to the exclusion of 
liability based on dangerousness. In accordance with art 437 KC, the liability regu-
lated in arts 435 and 436 KC cannot be excluded or limited in advance. Moreover, a 
person cannot effectively consent to personal injury if the perpetrator&rsquo;s conduct 
is unlawful; such consent would be considered contrary to the principles of com-
munity life ( art 58 &sect; 2 KC )400.
</p>
<p>Dangerousness is important not only when introducing a provision estab-
lishing no-fault liability; it may also be crucial when determining the scope of its 
application. For example, increased dangerousness is vital for the interpretation 
of the concept of motion of a motor vehicle, which is one of the prerequisites of 
</p>
<p>396  Łopuski, KPP no 3 / 2004, 683 f.
397  Łopuski, KPP no 3 / 2004, 672. Łopuski emphasises that increased danger may be created by the 
</p>
<p>functioning of entities other than those listed in art 435 KC as well as by activities different 
from those consisting in the use of natural forces ( at 683 ) and also indicates that the risk gen-
erated depends on the way natural forces are used, which should be taken into account when 
regulating liability ( at 692 ).
</p>
<p>398 He also points out that instead of strict liability, such a general norm could introduce a pre-
sumption of fault or a presumption of liability; Łopuski, KPP no 3 / 2004, 694.

<p>liability based on art 436 KC. It is through the application of this criterion that 
Polish courts have extended the concept of &raquo; motion &laquo; to vehicles not moving in a 
physical sense401.
</p>
<p>The Polish Civil Code does not restrict liability for dangerousness by impos-
ing monetary limits on compensation.
</p>
<p>V.  Permitted interference
</p>
<p>The most important example of a situation where the legal system allows for an in-
terference with third-party goods against compensation for the damage inflicted 
is art 142 KC, which prohibits the owner from opposing the use or even the damag-
ing or destruction of a thing by another person if it is necessary to ward off an im-
pending danger which directly jeopardises the personality rights402 of that person 
or of a third party; the owner may, however, demand the redress of damage result-
ing therefrom. The same applies in the case of danger jeopardising property in-
terests, unless the impending damage is obviously and disproportionately smaller 
than the loss which the owner might suffer as a result of the use, damaging or de-
struction of the thing. As Koziol emphasises, in such cases the owner is denied de-
fensive rights, but his interests are still protected by a claim for damages403.
</p>
<p>VI.  Economic capacity to bear the burden
</p>
<p>Polish tort law takes into account financial circumstances in the case of liability 
based on the principles of equity as well as in situations where a natural person 
has a duty to redress damage caused to another natural person ( art 440 KC ). The 
former arises only by way of exception and solely in cases provided for by statute. 
The provisions establishing such liability are art 417 2 KC ( liability for personal in-
jury caused by the lawful exercise of public authority ), art 428 KC ( liability of per-
sons under the age of responsibility as well as of those incapable of committing 
fault due to their mental or physical state in situations where there are no persons 
obliged to exercise supervision or it is not possible to obtain compensation from 
these persons ) and art 431 &sect; 2 KC ( liability of persons who keep or use an animal

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>to whom fault in supervision, which is the prerequisite of liability for damage 
caused by animals in Polish law, cannot be attributed, and who are consequently 
not liable based on art 431 &sect; 1 KC ). In the first case, the injured party may demand 
compensation for personal injury ( or, more precisely, full or partial compensa-
tion of pecuniary loss as well as compensation for non-pecuniary harm ) caused 
by the lawful exercise of public authority if the circumstances of the case, and in par-
ticular the victim&rsquo;s incapacity to work or his / her difficult financial situation, indicate 
that  equity  considerations  require  such  compensation.  In the latter two situations, 
full or partial compensation may be claimed by the injured party if it follows from 
the circumstances of the case, and in particular from the comparison of the financial 
situation of the victim and the perpetrator or the person keeping or using the animal 
that the principles of community life so require; compensation may, however, only be 
awarded if the damage was caused unlawfully404.
</p>
<p>Art 440 KC states that in relations between natural persons the extent of the 
duty to redress damage may be limited ( but not excluded ! )405 in accordance with 
the circumstances, provided that such limitation is required by the principles of 
community life in view of the financial situation of the injured party or of the per-
son liable for damage. It must be emphasised that financial circumstances are not 
the only factor taken into account and that regard must be had to the principles 
of equity, which is why a limitation of compensation will not be permitted, eg, if 
there is serious fault on the part of the perpetrator406. In accordance with estab-
lished case law, art 440 KC is not applicable if the person obliged to redress dam-
age has third-party liability insurance407 as the existence of insurance cover influ-
ences his financial situation408.
</p>
<p>VII.  Realisation of profit
</p>
<p>The view that a person drawing profits from a particular thing or activity which 
is a source of risk should also bear the burden of damage caused by them ( eius 
damnum cuius commodum ) is one of the justifications for risk-based liability409.

<p>VIII.  Insurability and  
actual insurance cover
</p>
<p>Insurability is undoubtedly a factor justifying the introduction of liability inde-
pendent of fault410. As for actual insurance cover, it only encompasses existing li-
ability and cannot serve as a justification for establishing a duty to pay damages, 
although it has been observed to have a psychological effect on judges and make 
them more prone to impose liability or expand its scope ( eg in the case of compul-
sory motor third-party liability insurance )411. It must also be noted that in the field 
of liability based on equity the fact that the perpetrator is insured against civil li-
ability should be taken into account when assessing his / her financial situation, 
which is a crucial circumstance in the course of determining whether compensa-
tion should be awarded to the victim ( see no 3 / 137 above )412.
</p>
<p>IX.  Contributory responsibility of the victim
</p>
<p>Contributory responsibility of the victim is regulated in art 362 of the Civil Code, 
which states that &raquo; if the injured party contributed to the occurrence or aggrava-
tion of damage, the duty to redress it will be correspondingly reduced in accord-
ance with the circumstances, and in particular with the degree of both parties&rsquo; 
fault. &laquo; Unlike the Code of Obligations, which treated the victim&rsquo;s contributory 
conduct as entailing a reduction of damages ( art 158 &sect; 2 KZ ), the Civil Code speaks 
of a reduction of a duty to compensate. Art 362 KC has given rise to various interpre-
tations, and the issue of the victim&rsquo;s contributory conduct is still not fully resolved 
in Polish law413. There are four proposed interpretations of art 362 KC; the first one 
assumes that the victim has contributed to the occurrence or aggravation of dam-
age if his / her conduct is in a causal connection with the damage414. In accordance 
with the second interpretation, causation alone is not sufficient and must be ac-
companied by the victim&rsquo;s objective misconduct415; both these theories could be

<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>described as variations of the theory of differentiation ( Differenzierungsthese )416. 
The third interpretation considers the victim&rsquo;s conduct contributory when it is 
causal and at the same time culpable417. And finally, the fourth theory, which 
touches to a certain extent upon the equal treatment theory ( Gleichbehandlung-
sthese ), makes the assessment dependent on the basis of the tortfeasor&rsquo;s liability: 
if the liability is fault-based, there must be fault on the part of the victim in order 
for his / her conduct to be treated as contributory, and if it is risk- or equity-based, 
objective inappropriateness of the victim&rsquo;s behaviour is sufficient418. Here it must 
be emphasised that in Polish law only the conduct of the injured party may result 
in his contributory responsibility, and not events beyond his control419.
</p>
<p>There is no unanimity in the case law or doctrine as to which theory is most 
appropriate in the light of art 362 KC, but an observation may be made that the 
second and fourth interpretations have found more followers420. According to es-
tablished case law concerning arts 435 and 436 KC, if the tortfeasor&rsquo;s liability is 
risk-based, damages may be reduced even when fault cannot be attributed to the 
victim; in such cases, the injured party&rsquo;s objectively inappropriate behaviour is 
sufficient421. This means that minors below the age of responsibility as well as 
the mentally unstable may contribute to the existence or aggravation of damage 
within the meaning of art 362 KC.
</p>
<p>A view has also been expressed which, although not in line with the wording of 
art 362 KC422, is gaining increasing support both in case law and in the relevant lit-
erature, to the effect that the victim&rsquo;s contribution to the damage suffered should 
be understood as all of his / her conduct that is in an adequate causal connection 
with the inflicted damage, but that such contribution does not result in the court&rsquo;s

</p>
<p>duty to limit compensation; whether a limitation should take place depends on 
the &raquo; circumstances of the case &laquo;423.
</p>
<p>The most important circumstance taken into account in the course of assess-
ment of whether an apportionment of damage should take place, and the only 
one explicitly mentioned in art 362 KC, is the degree of fault of both parties424. 
Other criteria are: the degree of contribution; the degree to which objective rules 
of conduct have been infringed by the parties; the motives which drove the victim 
to undertake the damaging conduct ( eg altruistic motivation )425. It is emphasised 
that all circumstances in casu should be taken into consideration and that the as-
sessment needs to be individualised426. In other words, it is the weighing up of all 
the relevant factors in a given case that is decisive for the question of damage ap-
portionment. It has been pointed out that mere causation by the victim&rsquo;s conduct 
may lead to a limitation of compensation even if there is fault on the part of the 
tortfeasor, provided that the degree of the victim&rsquo;s contribution is very high while 
the perpetrator&rsquo;s fault is only slight427. If, on the other hand, the injured party&rsquo;s 
contribution is slight and there is intention on the part of the tortfeasor, compen-
sation will not be limited428; the same applies to a situation where the victim was 
negligent while the tortfeasor acted with intent429.
</p>
<p>Like in the Germanic systems, the contributory conduct of the victim is also 
counted against the claims of persons entitled to compensation in the case of the 
victim&rsquo;s death430.

<p>424 The fault of the injured party is naturally understood differently than the tortfeasor&rsquo;s fault, 
that is, in a nutshell, as a censurable failure to exercise due care in one&rsquo;s own affairs ( see, inter 
alia, Szpunar, Wina poszkodowanego 76; Radwański / Olejniczak, Zobowiązania 244 ). Unlawful-
ness is neither a prerequisite nor an element of the victim&rsquo;s fault. In most cases the injured 
party&rsquo;s behaviour will not be unlawful since there is no general duty not to cause damage to 
oneself. As Koziol points out, due to the absence of wrongfulness, contributory fault is signifi-
cantly less substantial than real fault ( Basic Questions I, no 6 / 217 ).

<p>Article 362 KC is also applicable in cases where it is not the victim him / herself 
who contributed to the damage suffered, but persons for whom he / she is liable 
based on the provisions establishing liability for others. In other words, the victim 
is burdened with the consequences of the conduct of persons for whom he / she 
would be liable if they caused damage to a third party431. As Kubas points out, the 
tortfeasor should not be worse off in cases where there is contribution to the dam-
age on the part of persons who act in the injured party&rsquo;s interest, or who remain 
under his / her supervision or control432.

<p> Part 7 Limitations of liability
</p>
<p>It is beyond doubt in Polish law too that making the liable party responsible for 
all the harm for which the event triggering his / her liability was a condition would 
be unreasonable433; instruments are therefore applied that set limits to liability for 
damage. These will be examined below.
</p>
<p>I.  Interruption of the causal link ?
</p>
<p>The concept of an &raquo; interruption of the causal link &laquo; is known to Polish law, al-
though, as Koziol points out invoking Stark and Oftinger, it can only be examined 
in the context of adequacy434. As is indicated by Koch, if an event ( nova causa inter-
veniens ) appears in the causal chain which constitutes a conditio sine qua non of 
the damage inflicted, but which is not a normal result of a given cause, the conse-
quences of this event cannot be attributed to the cause, which means that liability 
for the latter only encompasses consequences which appeared before said event435. 
Koch admits that the term &raquo; interruption of a causal link &laquo;, employed also by the Su-
preme Court436, is a metaphor but claims that it is tempting to use it as it is one 
that reflects the situation well437.
</p>
<p>II.  Adequacy
</p>
<p>The theory of adequacy is a theory of causation in Polish law ( see no 3 / 77 above )438; 
here it must be emphasised once again that causation is considered to fulfil a 
double function: it is both a prerequisite of liability and a factor setting the lim-
its thereof. The criterion of adequacy finds its legal basis in art 361 &sect; 1 KC, which 
states that the person obliged to pay damages is liable only for the normal conse-
quences of the act or omission from which the damage resulted.

<p>239Part 7&emsp; &emsp; Limitations&emsp;of&emsp;liability
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol (  ed  ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>The prevailing view is that an adequate causal connection within the mean-
ing of art 361 &sect; 1 KC is an objective category and that consequently the normality 
of consequences cannot be treated as their predictability439, the latter criterion be-
ing associated with the question of fault440. It has, however, been questioned in 
the relevant literature whether a complete rejection of the &raquo; predictability &laquo; bench-
mark is appropriate and whether it would not lead to inequitable results441. Dam-
age is deemed to be a normal consequence of an event when it results from that 
event in the normal course of things442. As Koch emphasises, it is characteristic for 
the theory of adequacy that it treats as legally relevant only those conditions that 
increase the likelihood of the occurrence of damage443. A normal consequence 
is therefore a consequence that ensues usually, predominantly, as a rule ( which 
does not mean always )444 as a result of a given event445. In the course of determin-
ing whether a consequence is normal within the meaning of art 361 &sect; 1 KC, courts 
must take into account, inter alia, the state of knowledge in a given field as well 
as objective criteria resulting from life experience and achievements of science446.
</p>
<p>Although a view has been expressed to the effect that where a provision lists 
specific exonerating circumstances such as force majeure, exclusive fault of a 
third party or exclusive fault of the injured party ( eg arts 433, 435, 436 KC ) it suf-
fices that a given event is a conditio sine qua non for the damage447, the prevail-
ing &ndash; and correct &ndash; opinion is that art 361 &sect; 1 KC regulates the causal connection 
as a prerequisite of  any  liability for damage, irrespective of whether it is fault-
based or strict448. It is consequently emphasised that an exception to the require-
ment of adequacy must be introduced by an explicit legal provision449. Examples 
of such are Civil Code provisions introducing liability for a so-called casus mixtus  
( arts 478, 714, 739, 841 KC ), ie imposing responsibility also for accidental conse-
quences of the perpetrator&rsquo;s conduct that would not have ensued if he / she had 
</p>
<p>439 It is emphasised that predictability ( foreseeability ) is tied with the prerequisite of fault even 
if it is perceived in the abstract ( objective ) sense, that is as the possibility to foresee a given 
result by an average, reasonable person; see  Koch, Związek przyczynowy 130;  Jastrzębski, PS

<p>acted lawfully450. A deviation from the principle of adequacy is also accepted in 
cases of intention ( no 3 / 114 above ): it is pointed out that if the perpetrator&rsquo;s intent 
embraces abnormal consequences, so should his / her liability.
</p>
<p>III.  The protective purpose of the rule
</p>
<p>A.  In general
</p>
<p>In Polish tort law the idea of the protective purpose of the rule is embraced by the 
concept of relative wrongfulness451. According to Szpunar, a rule protects certain 
interests and it is only the infringement of these interests that is unlawful452. This 
view is shared, inter alia, by Lewaszkiewicz-Petrykowska453. The usefulness of the 
concept of relative wrongfulness, the application of which is considered to lead 
to a limitation of the extent of compensable damage as determined in accordance 
with the theory of adequacy454, is, however, also questioned in the relevant litera-
ture455. Safjan points out that since the theory of relative wrongfulness is tradition-
ally tied to contractual liability, the prerequisite for which is the violation of obli-
gations burdening the debtor in relation to the creditor and not an infringement 
of the universal rules of proper conduct, it remains in opposition to the ideas 
underlying the concept of tort in the light of art 415 KC456. He also claims that it 
seems to lead to confusion between the prerequisites of liability as it enters into 
the realm of causation, and more specifically deals with questions resolved on 
the basis of the theory of adequacy457. It has been pointed out that the aims ful-
filled by the concept of relative wrongulness may be reached by an appropriate ap-
</p>
<p>450 See, inter alia, Banaszczyk in: Pietrzykowski, Kodeks cywilny 1333.
451  Koch, who emphasises that it is a theory of wrongfulness and not of causation, questions its 
</p>
<p>usefulness in Polish law ( Koch, Związek przyczynowy 114 f ).
452  A. Szpunar, Note on SN judgment of 3.  3.  1956, 2 CR 166 / 56, OSPiKA no 7-8 / 1959, item 197, 382. 
</p>
<p>Szpunar also states that compensation may only be claimed by the person whose interests are 
protected by the norm ( ibidem ).
</p>
<p>453  Lewaszkiewicz-Petrykowska in: Studia Prawno-Ekonomiczne 91. The concept of the protective 
purpose of the rule is also supported by Kasprzyk, who emphasises both the personal scope 
of protection and the subject matter protective scope: R. Kasprzyk, Bezprawność względna, SP 
no 3 / 1988, 149 ff.
</p>
<p>454  Kaliński in: Olejniczak, System Prawa Prywatnego 58.

</p>
<p>rek,  Problem bezprawności względnej w systemie odpowiedzialności deliktowej, Palestra 
no 5-6 / 2004, 36 ff.
</p>
<p>456 To this it is rightly countered that the universal character of duties stipulated by tort law provi-
sions relates only to the potential infringer, and that it does not mean that a given norm cannot 
protect the interests of only certain persons ( M. Kaliński, Szkoda na mieniu [ 2008 ] 121 ).

<p>proach to causality, and more precisely by examining whether a causal connection 
exists between the damage and the element of damage-causing conduct which is 
decisive for classifying the conduct as wrongful458. The correctness of such an ap-
proach, which involves splitting the damaging event and singling out the part of 
it deemed to be decisive for determining wrongfulness has, however, been ques-
tioned459. The critics of relative wrongfulness also indicate that difficulties arise 
when the purpose of the infringed norm is not sufficiently specified460, but it is 
countered that these are usually possible to overcome461.
</p>
<p>B.  The special problem of lawful alternative conduct
</p>
<p>Unlike in the Germanic systems, lawful alternative conduct has not been 
widely discussed in Polish literature or dealt with in depth by case law. The prob-
lem of such conduct is either regarded as a case of hypothetical causation462, or 
considered in the context of wrongfulness463. In a judgment of 14 January 2005464, 
referred to under no 3 / 94 above and concerning unlawfully conducted enforce-
ment proceedings465, the Supreme Court stated that lawful alternative conduct 
cannot lead to an exemption from liability  if  the perpetrator&rsquo;s actual conduct vio-
lated a norm intended to prevent damage for which he is to be made liable, as other-
wise the guarantee function of this norm would be undermined466. The facts of 
the case were as follows: the claimant obtained three bank loans, all of which he 
failed to pay back. The bank therefore issued three enforcement orders, of which 
only one had a ( legally required ) writ of execution appended. A bailiff not only 
conducted enforcement proceedings based on this order, but also partially en-
forced the other two debts. The claimant requested the return of the amounts col-
lected from him on the basis of unlawfully conducted enforcement proceedings. 
The Court of Appeals denied liability with the justification that although the bank 
enforced two of the claimant&rsquo;s debts in violation of the law, it did not cause him 
any damage but only a reduction of his indebtedness. The Supreme Court, how-
ever, reversed this judgment and stated that unlawfully conducted enforcement 
proceedings cannot result in diminishing the claimant&rsquo;s debts. It held that the de-

<p>fendant cannot be released from liability based on the fact that the same damage 
would have ensued in the case of lawful proceedings. The Court did not examine 
the issue of lawful alternative behaviour in depth and failed to provide a more ex-
tensive justification for its decision, which makes it difficult to properly analyse 
its approach. If the judgment&rsquo;s wording alone is anything to go by, it indicates a 
focus on the result, since the Supreme Court speaks of rules intended to prevent 
damage and not rules aimed at preventing damage being caused in a certain way / by 
a certain behaviour467. Whether a clear distinction between one and the other is 
possible, and whether the legal consequences of breaching a rule should be differ-
ent in each case, is another matter468, and one that the Court appears not to have 
had under consideration. On the other hand, however, in the case at hand the SN 
refused to accept the defence of lawful alternative behaviour in a situation where 
procedural norms were infringed, and held that admitting this defence would &raquo; un-
dermine the guarantee function of the violated provisions &laquo;. The message that the 
Court&rsquo;s reasoning seems to convey is that the infringed norm is there not to pre-
vent the result; the result as such &ndash; transferring money from the claimant to the 
defendant, where it belongs, thereby reducing the former&rsquo;s debts &ndash; is in fact de-
sired, but only provided that it is achieved following certain procedures, which 
safeguard the claimant&rsquo;s interests. All in all, and notwithstanding the exact word-
ing of the judgment conclusion, the approach taken by the Supreme Court seems 
consistent with the view that the defence of lawful alternative conduct does not 
lead to exemption from liability if the violated rule&rsquo;s aim is not so much prevent-
ing damage, but doing away with certain types of behaviour469.
</p>
<p>Kaliński points out that where there is no infringement of a norm aimed at 
preventing the damage that was inflicted in a given case, there is no relative wrong-
fulness  ( assuming that one accepts the concept of relative wrongfulness &ndash; com-
ment KLR ), and consequently liability cannot arise not because of the defence of 
lawful alternative conduct, but due to the fact that the prerequisite of wrongful-
ness has not been fulfilled470.

</p>
<p>establishing liability one should not pass over the protective purpose of the rule and the fact 
that damage was inflicted in the very way that the violated norm was intended to prevent. He 
points out that marginalizing procedural guarantees ( even if only in the course of establishing 
liability for damage ) would undermine the integrity of the legal system ( note on the judgment 
of 14.  1.  2005, III CK 193 / 04, OSP no 7-8 / 2006, item 989, 423 ).

</p>
<p>IV.  Intervening wilful act by a third party  
or by the victim
</p>
<p>Intervening acts of third parties are looked at in the context of adequacy. The oc-
currence of such an act may be regarded as interrupting a normal causal link471 &ndash; an 
expression the Supreme Court is known to employ in its case law472. As is empha-
sised, inter alia, by Dybowski,  if apart from a given cause another event contrib-
uted to the occurrence of a ( damaging ) consequence, which other event is not a 
normal consequence of the first event, then the second event determines the limit 
of liability from the point of view of causality473. This refers not only to deliberate, 
but also to negligent conduct. For example, the faulty repair of a car damaged in a 
traffic accident, which made corrections necessary, was regarded by the Supreme 
Court as a factor interrupting the causal link between the accident and the state of 
the car after repairs474. In another judgment, the Court stated that the person who 
caused a fire was not responsible for the results of a second fire, which broke out 
some time after the first one because the fire brigade negligently failed to cut off 
the supply of electricity from the affected building. The Court held that in this case 
the normal causal connection was interrupted and that the second fire was not a nor-
mal consequence of the action or omission of the person responsible for the first fire475.
</p>
<p>When harm is brought about by a decision of the victim, the question of its 
imputability will be determined in accordance with art 362 KC, which deals with 
the injured party&rsquo;s contribution to both the occurrence and the aggravation of dam-
age ( see no 3 / 140 above ). Banaszczyk stresses that the victim&rsquo;s contribution cannot 
under any circumstances justify a refusal to award damages476; a different view is 
presented by Granecki, who holds that if the injured party  intentionally contrib-
uted to the occurrence of damage, compensation should be refused477.
</p>
<p>V.  Limits of liability

<p> Part 8 The compensation of damage
</p>
<p>I.  Extent of compensation
</p>
<p>The extent of compensation is determined by the principle of full restitution, ex-
pressed in art 361 &sect; 2 KC, in accordance with which compensation encompasses 
both damnum emergens and lucrum cessans ( see no 3 / 48 above ). In order for the 
latter to be compensable, a high degree of probability is sufficient; to be precise, 
it must be reasonable to assume that the profit would really have been gained478.
</p>
<p>The principle of comprehensive compensation is not valid in the field of li-
ability based on equity ( arts 417   2, 428, 431 &sect; 2 KC ), where the Civil Code entitles the 
injured party to full or partial compensation ( see no 3 / 136 above ) or in employer-
employee relationships, since the liability of the latter towards the former is lim-
ited to three times the monthly salary unless there is intent on the employee&rsquo;s part 
( see no 3 / 48 above ).
</p>
<p>The principle of full restitution is also subject to restrictions, which have been 
dealt with above. Firstly, not all harm will be compensated, but only such as is 
in an adequate causal connection with the damage-causing event, save when the 
tortfeasor is liable for intent, as in this case he / she is also deemed responsible 
for the abnormal consequences of his / her conduct ( see above nos 3 / 148 ff; 3 / 114 ). 
Other instruments restricting the scope of protection of tort law provisions are 
the concept of relative wrongfulness, embodying the theory of the protective pur-
pose of the rule ( no 3 / 151 above ), and, linked with this concept, the generally ac-
cepted principle that the law only allows for the reparation of losses suffered by the 
direct victim ( no 3 / 102 above ). Regard must also be had to the rules governing con-
tributory responsibility of the victim ( art 362 KC ) as well as to the possibility of re-
ducing damages in relations between natural persons ( art 440 KC ). A restriction in 
the form of a de minimis threshold is provided by product liability law.
</p>
<p>II.  Types of compensation
</p>
<p>Unlike in the Germanic systems, in Poland the injured party has a right to choose 
between monetary compensation and restoration of the previous state. Only when

</p>
<p>the restoration is impossible or would entail excessive hardships or costs for the 
liable party is remuneration in money the only option ( art 363 &sect; 1 KC ). As for the 
possibility of combining the two types of compensation, the correct &ndash; although 
not undisputed &ndash; view seems to be that it is possible to claim damages when natu-
ral restitution does not provide full compensation to the injured party479. This has 
been confirmed, inter alia, by Supreme Court judgments concerning car accident 
damage, in which the Court stated that if in spite of repairs the damaged car has 
not been fully restored to its previous condition, the injured party is entitled to 
additional monetary compensation. The Supreme Court has also confirmed the 
compensability of loss of commercial value480.
</p>
<p>III.  Periodic or lump sum
</p>
<p>Polish law provides for compensation in the form of periodical payments instead 
of a lump sum in cases regulated in art 444 &sect; 2 ( bodily injury or a health disorder ) 
as well as art 446 &sect; 2 KC ( death of a person burdened with a maintenance duty or 
voluntarily providing a means of subsistence to another person ). Non-pecuniary 
loss cannot be compensated by means of an annuity. An annuity once awarded 
may be adjusted to take account of changed circumstances ( art 907 &sect; 2 KC ).
</p>
<p>In accordance with art 444 &sect; 2 KC, if the injured party has lost his / her working 
capacity, wholly or partially, if his / her needs have increased or if his / her prospects 
for the future have deteriorated, he / she may claim an appropriate annuity from 
the person obliged to redress the damage. If at the time of the judgment the dam-
age cannot yet be accurately assessed, a temporary annuity may be granted ( art 444 
&sect; 3 KC ). Art 446 &sect; 2 states that a person entitled by statute to support from the de-
ceased may claim, from the person obliged to redress the damage, an annuity as-
sessed according to the needs of the injured person and to the financial standing 
as well as the earning capacity of the deceased during the probable duration of the 
duty to support ( so-called compulsory annuity ). An annuity may also be claimed 
by other persons close to the deceased, to whom the deceased voluntarily and con-
tinuously supplied the means of subsistence, if it follows from the circumstances 
that the principles of community life so require ( so-called non-compulsory annu-
ity ). According to art 447 KC, at the request of the injured party and when there are

<p>weighty reasons for it, the court may award compensation to him / her in the form 
of a lump sum instead of an annuity or part of such; this pertains in particular to 
cases where the injured party has become disabled and granting him / her a lump 
sum will make it easier for him / her to exercise a new profession. It follows from 
the wording of art 447 KC that it is up to the injured party, and not at the court&rsquo;s 
discretion, to determine the form of compensation. The simple desire of the vic-
tim is, however, not enough reason to award a lump sum instead of an annuity: 
important reasons must be present which justify such a solution.
</p>
<p>Similarly to the Germanic systems, the costs of future medical treatment may 
be requested in advance ( art 444 &sect; 1 sent 2 KC ).
</p>
<p>IV.  Reduction of the duty to compensate
</p>
<p>There is no general clause in the Civil Code allowing for a reduction of damages. 
Under the Code of Obligations, the role of such a clause was fulfilled by art 158 
&sect; 1, which stated that the amount of compensation must be determined having 
regard to all the circumstances of the case, and which grew to be very broadly in-
terpreted by courts481. There is no equivalent of art 158 &sect; 1 KZ in the Civil Code. Re-
duction of damages is possible only under art 440 KC482, which allows for it solely 
under certain, clearly stipulated conditions, namely when both the victim and the 
liable party are natural persons and when a reduction is required by the princi-
ples of community life due to the financial status of the injured party or of the li-
able party ( see no 3 / 137 above ). It is emphasised that modifying the prerequisites 
for reduction by means of a reference to the concept of the abuse of a right ( art 5 
KC ) and, for example, allowing such reduction in relationships between natural 
persons and legal entities, is not permitted483. Szpunar has pointed out that the 
wording of art 440 KC leaves no doubt as to the fact that the legislator wanted to 
tighten these prerequisites as well as that art 5 KC should not be understood as a 
norm overriding other provisions of private law and restricting a duty to compen-
sate introduced by them484. It has also been pointed out that art 440 KC regulates 
the reduction of damages exhaustively and excludes the application of art 5 KC485.

</p>
<p> Part 9  Prescription of compensation claims
</p>
<p>The Polish legislator has opted for a rule combining a short and a long prescription 
period for delictual claims, each of which begins to run at a different point in time. 
The short period is three years and commences on the day on which the injured 
party acquired knowledge of the damage and of the person obliged to redress it ( 442 1 
&sect; 1 sent 1 KC ). The long period is introduced by art 442 1 &sect; 1 sent 2 KC, pursuant to 
which the prescription period cannot be longer than ten years from the date of the 
occurrence of the damaging event. If damage was caused by a crime, art 442 1 &sect; 2 KC 
applies, according to which the claim becomes time-barred twenty years after the 
crime was committed, irrespective of when the injured party acquired knowledge 
of the damage and of the person liable.
</p>
<p>There is a special prescription regime for personal injury claims: such claims 
cannot become time-barred earlier than three years from the day on which the in-
jured party acquired knowledge of the damage and of the person liable ( art 442 1 &sect; 3 
KC ). This means that neither the long-stop period of ten years, nor the period of 
twenty years concerning damage caused by a crime, applies to such claims, which 
are in effect only limited by the short prescription period counted a tempore sci-
entiae486. However, one exception to this rule is acknowledged: if a personal injury 
was caused by a crime and the three-year period introduced by art 442 1 &sect; 3 KC fin-
ishes earlier than the twenty-year period regulated by art 442 1 &sect; 2 KC, the claim for 
compensation will become time-barred with the lapse of the latter rather than the 
former; this may be inferred from the wording of art 442 1 &sect; 3 KC ( &raquo; the claim cannot 
become time-barred earlier ( &hellip; ) &laquo;, which allows the conclusion that it can become 
time-barred later )487.
</p>
<p>The Civil Code also introduces a special rule protecting victims who are mi-
nors: according to art 442 1 &sect; 4 KC, a personal injury claim of a minor cannot be-
come time-barred earlier than two years from the day on which he / she reaches the 
age of majority.
</p>
<p>The rules on prescription in their present form are the result of an amend-
ment of the Civil Code which came into force in August 2007488, and which created 
a special prescription regime for personal injury claims, prolonged from ten to 
</p>

<p>twenty years the long-stop period concerning claims for compensation of damage 
caused by a crime and introduced a special provision regarding personal injury 
claims of minors. The amendment followed the decision of the Constitutional Tri-
bunal of 1 September 2006, which found the provision of the Civil Code introduc-
ing a ten-year long-stop period counted from the day the event causing damage 
took place ( art 442 &sect; 1 sent 2 KC ) unconstitutional due to the fact that it deprived 
the injured party of the possibility to obtain compensation for personal injury 
that occurred after this time489.
</p>
<p>As follows from the above, the idea that a long prescription period should not 
commence prior to the occurrence of damage490 is not reflected in Polish law; in-
stead, the scope of application of the long-stop period counted a tempore facti has 
been restricted by excluding from it claims concerning interests most worthy of 
protection, ie personal injury claims.

unconstitutional by the Tribunal, was subject to two diverging interpretations: a literal and a 
functional one. The latter, in accordance with which the ten-year long prescription period began 
to run on the day on which the damage occurred, was eventually rejected ( see the resolution of 
the Full Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of 17.  2.  2006, III CZP 84 / 05, OSNC no 7-8 / 2006, item

</p>
<p>I.  The victim&rsquo;s own risk
</p>
<p>The overall tendency of looking at the world as if there should always be some-
one else responsible for losses suffered by members of society is also perceptible 
in Hungary. This general attitude of escaping self-reliance is present not only in 
reactions and expectations communicated in the mass media in connection with 
personal injury cases and high patrimonial losses suffered as a result of catastro-
phes or natural forces, but also in tendencies towards expanding liability in some 
specific fields of tort law, especially in some cases of professional negligence.
</p>
<p>Despite this tendency, the starting point of risk allocation in Hungarian pri-
vate law is also the principle that the victim bears the loss if someone else does 
not have to do so. Thus, damage is to be borne by the person who suffered it, ex-
cept when this is otherwise provided by the law. The basic principle of casum sentit 
dominus is provided as a property law rule1 but is applied as the general rule of risk 
allocation in private law. It would also follow from the inner logic of law and the 
role of objective law in creating subjective rights and obligations: in the absence 
of objective law establishing such an obligation, there is no duty to pay compensa-
tion for losses suffered by other persons. Specific rules of risk allocation shifting 
the loss to persons other than the victim are provided in different parts of private

<p>law. A statutory system of compensating lawfully caused losses such as those de-
riving from compulsory purchases or takings is provided for in specific legislation 
and is regarded as belonging to property law regulation. The question of whether 
it is allowed for the state to take over the property of persons, and if so, whether 
this can be done with or without an obligation to compensate the aggrieved owner 
as well as further problems of compensation, such as how compensation is to be 
provided, how it shall be measured and what types of losses may remain uncom-
pensated are questions of the constitutional protection of property.
</p>
<p>The allocation of risk of losses caused in the course of avoiding threatening 
danger ( necessity ) or self-defence is provided for in the property law regulation. 
There is a specific risk allocation rule covering the rights of the owner to receive 
compensation if goods were sacrificed in order to avoid the consequences of dan-
ger2. Liability in tort, as well as liability for breach of contract and restitution of 
unjust enrichment, is provided as part of the law of obligations.
</p>
<p>There is a specific and unique risk allocation regime provided in a specific 
norm as a consequence of non-compliance with the principle of good faith and 
fair dealing. This rule creates a basis for compensation claims for losses suffered 
as a result of conduct induced by other persons and legitimate expectations cre-
ated by them. According to this provision, if someone, with intentional conduct, 
induced another person in good faith and with good reason to act in a certain way, 
the former may be held fully or partly liable to compensate the latter for the dam-
age he suffered through no fault of his own, because he relied on the inducement 
of the former. The conjunctive prerequisites for responsibility for such behaviour 
under &sect; 6 Civil Code 1959 are3: intentional conduct ( which does not necessarily 
aim at influencing the behaviour of the aggrieved person )4; the aggrieved person 
acted in good faith; the aggrieved person acting in good faith relied on the con-
duct in question and that conduct induced him &ndash; with reasonable ground &ndash; to act5; 
the aggrieved person suffered harm as a result of his own conduct induced by the 
other; and the aggrieved person suffered harm through no fault of his own.
</p>
<p>This provision of the Civil Code 1959 established an obligation which is not 
based on tort liability: neither fault nor unlawfulness of the defendant&rsquo;s conduct 
is a precondition of the obligation to compensate the victim. A contractual re-
lationship between the parties precludes the application of this rule6. The rule

<p>aims at protecting reliance interests &ndash; just like estoppel in common law jurisdic-
tions &ndash; and allocating the risks involved in the plaintiff&rsquo;s own conduct7. It is a gen-
eral remedy for suffering harm as a consequence of reliance on another&rsquo;s conduct. 
Fault, duty of care or compliance with required standards of conduct are not to be 
considered in the course of establishing such obligation to award partial or total 
compensation to the aggrieved person. This rule gives the opportunity for an ex 
post direct risk allocation in the hands of the judge, independently of the legal 
evaluation of the behaviour of the defendant.
</p>
<p>The provision is very specific from a theoretical as well as from a practical 
point of view. It puts behaviour, namely the conduct inducing the aggrieved per-
son to do something, into a grey area, somewhere between conduct that is legally 
prohibited and conduct that is legally allowed from the point of view of legal eval-
uation. The theoretical starting point of the legislator was to provide a remedy for 
the consequences of behaviour which is neither unlawful ( unlawfulness would 
establish liability in tort ) nor lawful ( lawful behaviour shall not be sanctioned ) 
and does not consist of a breach of a contractual promise either8. From this it fol-
lows that this provision cannot be applied if the conduct triggers liability in tort 
or establishes liability for breach of contract. In such cases, the victim would be 
entitled to claim a remedy for tort or for breach of contract. The conduct which 
the aggrieved person relied upon can neither be prohibited nor amount to an offer 
or acceptance resulting in the conclusion of a contract9. According to this specific 
rule of risk allocation, the court may impose an obligation on the person inducing 
the other to act, to compensate fully or in part the aggrieved person who suffered 
harm. The court has a wide discretionary power in deciding whether or not to or-
der compensation at all, and if it does so, to what extent the aggrieved party&rsquo;s loss 
is to be compensated10. Courts in the past two decades seem to have been reluc-
tant to award damages on the basis of this rule. The general principle is that the 
application of this rule should not result in shifting normal business risks to other 
market players. The main rule the courts follow is that an enterprise has to bear 
the risk of its activities, even if it incurs expenses as a result of behaviour it was in-
clined towards by another party&rsquo;s statement. The frustrated party shall be entitled 
to compensation only if the statement of the other was so concrete and definite 
that the former could rely on contracting with reasonable certainty, especially if 
this reliance led the frustrated party to give up another alternative obligation or if 
it incurred reasonable extra expenditure11. Court practice is systematic in that the

whether to make or accept an offer and, if so, according to what terms ( including 
the price the party would expect to get or to pay ), or which party to choose if there 
are more different alternatives, shall be borne by the party itself and these costs 
and expenses cannot be shifted to the other even if the basis of this expenditure 
was an expectation that has been frustrated12.
</p>
<p>Insurance plays an increasingly important role in risk allocation. It does not, 
however, allocate or shift the risks covered in a final manner. Insurance law regula-
tion, with a statutory assignment ( cessio legis ), explicitly provides for the recourse 
rights of the insurance company against the tortfeasor. The insurance company, 
upon payment of compensation, shall become entitled to the rights of the insured 
with regard to the person liable for damages13. In the case of third-party ( liability ) 
insurance, this assignment by law was provided for cases of deliberate or grossly 
negligent wrongdoing specified in the insurance contract under the Civil Code 
195914 but is not covered by specific rules under the Civil Code 2013. This means 
that under the Civil Code 2013 it is up to the parties or to specific regulations to 
limit such claims by the insurer.
</p>
<p>There are also statutory compensation schemes in Hungary in order to pro-
vide compensation to victims of crimes15 and also to victims of catastrophes ( on 
an ad hoc basis ).
</p>
<p>Liability creating an obligation to compensate a victim for losses that are at-
tributable to the tortfeasor is a part of the risk allocation system, shifting the risk 
of losses that were caused unlawfully by other persons to such persons. Whether 
it is the actual wrongdoer or other persons ( operator of an extra-hazardous activ-
ity, an owner of a building, an employer, a principal, etc ) who shall be liable for 
providing the compensation depends on tort rules. As far as tort law in Hungary 
is concerned, there is no clear consensus on whether compensation or prevention 
is the primary aim of liability. Normally both of them are emphasised in theories 
of tort law and also in law-making.
</p>
<p>It seems that the structure, the basic principles and means of risk allocation 
in Hungarian law are in line with the main structures and principles of other ju-
risdictions. The specific features of Hungarian legislation do not lead to a system 
of risk allocation that would considerably differ from the risk allocation methods 
of other jurisdictions in Europe.

<p>II.  An insurance-based solution instead of  
liability law ?
</p>
<p>The idea that a comprehensive system of insurance could provide a general risk 
allocation regime in society, replacing tort liability, has also been presented in 
Hungarian legal literature.  S&oacute;lyom pointed out that the traditional structure of 
tort liability had been disappearing and growing into a new, insurance-based risk 
allocation system16. The tendency toward expanding insurance certainly holds 
true for some specific areas, like the compulsory third-party liability insurance 
regime for motor vehicles. Such regimes may change the allocation of risk as far 
as the losses covered by them are concerned but they do not necessarily change 
the structure of liability. It is still the liability of the insured tortfeasor that re-
mains the basis of the obligation of the insurance company to pay compensation 
to the victim. This always creates a strong link between insurance and tort liabil-
ity. Moreover, as a result of the statutory assignment provided by the regulation, 
the insurance company, as the assignee of the victim, has the right to enforce the 
claim against the person liable for damages. In such cases the basis of the claim of 
the insurance company is again the liability of the defendant. Thus, it seems that, 
if the risk allocation system in society intends to keep the preventive effect which 
is, according to the policy underlying liability, the indirect function of tort law17, 
insurance cannot provide a solution instead of liability law but can only be a kind 
of intermediary tool for risk spreading. Insurance can provide coverage for vic-
tims in order to make it certain that their loss will be compensated but this does 
not mean that it could replace the system of liability.
</p>
<p>In the socialist era, the wide-ranging national health insurance system pro-
vided an alternative risk allocation to tort law for cases of personal injury and that 
is still the case today. In cases of personal injury or impairment of health, only 
damages that are not covered by the national health insurance can be awarded to 
the victim on the basis of tort law. This means that for such cases national health 
insurance is also part of the risk allocation system.
</p>
<p>III.  Strict limits and rigid norms or fluid transitions 
and elastic rules ?
</p>
<p>From the point of view of structure, policy and regulation, there are clear distinc-
tions to be drawn between tort, contract and restitution, and, under tort law, be-

</p>
<p>tween the different prerequisites for liability. There are, however, no clear bound-
aries delimiting these sources of obligations, neither can the lines between the 
prerequisites for liability be consequently drawn. The basic common features of 
liability in tort and liability for breach of contract are that both are the conse-
quences ( sanctions ) of non-compliance with a duty and both concern an obliga-
tion to pay damages. The main differences are in the basic policy and in the as-
sessment of damages. The basic policy underlying tort law is compensation and 
prevention of wrongdoing, while in contract law it is the protection of the reliance 
on the promises of others. This approach is in line with the fact that, in the case of 
contracts, this duty was voluntarily undertaken by the party, while in tort the duty 
was imposed by law. As far as the assessment of damages is concerned, in tort law 
the victim should be restored to a position as if the damage had never occurred; 
on the other hand, in contract law the aggrieved party ought to be brought into a 
position as if the contractual promise had been kept. Although these differences 
may be seen as fundamental ones, that is not necessarily the case. While one ob-
jective is negative, ie &raquo; as if the loss had not been suffered &laquo;, and the other positive, 
ie &raquo; as if the contract had been performed &laquo;, the consequences in most cases can 
be interchangeable, ie performing the contract can equally be described as not 
breaching it. Rights and obligations can also be derived from law in the case of 
contracts, eg terms implied by interpretation of general clauses like good faith 
and fair dealing and contractual duties may be assumed by law even in the ab-
sence of contracts. Cases of compulsory contracting, either directly or indirectly, 
such as anti-discrimination law, or the modern remnants of the medieval com-
mon callings, make it impossible to draw a clear line between duties undertaken 
voluntarily and those imposed by law. Culpa in contrahendo as the basis for liabil-
ity for non-compliance with the implied obligations of the parties ( especially the 
duty of disclosure ) in the pre-contracting stage was a case for liability in tort ac-
cording to court practice, while in the Civil Code 2013 it either involves liability in 
tort or liability for breach of contract depending on whether the contract had been 
concluded is discussed in more detail below.
</p>
<p>Thus, although on the level of basic theory and doctrine there is a sharp dis-
tinction to be made between liability for torts and liability for breach of contract, 
this may not result in clear delimitations in practice or on the level of deeper anal-
yses.
</p>
<p>Damages and unjust enrichment seem to be two completely different legal 
institutions with only one common feature, namely, that the consequence is an 
obligation to pay a certain sum to the aggrieved person. With liability, there is the 
loss suffered by the victim and damages are to be calculated on the basis of that 
loss; the main policy behind liability is compensation of losses and prevention of 
wrongdoing; as a main rule, it is fault-based and also covers lost profit. At the fo-
cus of unjust enrichment is the benefit gained by the defendant to the detriment

<p>of the plaintiff; the main policy underlying the law of restitution is restoring the 
original state and avoiding illegal benefit; in the context of restitution no fault is to 
be considered and no lost profit is to be considered. This, however, does not mean 
that damages and unjust enrichment could not be overlapping categories. If, for 
example, a truck owned by a company is used for business purposes by another 
without any legal title to do so, this situation can be described either as a tort case 
where the owner can claim damages on the ground that he suffered losses ( costs 
of hiring another truck or lost profit ) due to wrongful interference with his prop-
erty or, as a case of unjust enrichment and restitution, where the owner can claim 
the profit the other party earned by using property which should have brought a 
profit to him. In such cases there cannot be a clear delimitation made between 
damages and unjust enrichment, although the position of the plaintiff is different 
in the two claims. On the one hand, the sums to be claimed are presumably not 
the same; the question of which is higher depends on the circumstances of the 
case. On the other hand, by claiming damages the plaintiff runs the risk that if the 
defendant can exonerate himself, he may be relieved of liability.
</p>
<p>Neither regulation nor prevailing doctrines refer to absolutely protected rights 
and unprotected interests in Hungarian tort law. Establishing priorities, however, 
has always been inherent in Hungarian tort law. The utmost protection of inher-
ent rights of persons, especially human dignity, health, and bodily integrity was 
already expressed in the landmark decisions of the Hungarian Constitutional 
Court on the incompatibility of the death penalty with the Constitution, declaring 
human life as an absolutely protected value, establishing the doctrine of &raquo; invis-
ible constitution &laquo;18 and on non-pecuniary damages as well19. This ranking of pro-
tected interests may be realised in very recent tendencies towards accepting and 
applying doctrines such as the acceptance of reducing the probability of recovery 
or loss of a chance as a causal link20 in medical malpractice cases21 and referring 
to strict forms of liability and expanding their scope in order to establish liability 
in other cases of personal injury22.
</p>
<p>It is often said that, although the main policy of preventing wrongdoing is 
common to tort and criminal law, the great difference between them is that crimi-
nal law is more flexible in the determination of applicable sanctions by taking into 
account and weighing the specific circumstances of the case as well as those of the 
tortfeasor. In contrast to this, private law, especially tort law, follows a &raquo; black or 
white &laquo; approach which is supported by the principle of full compensation. It may

<p>seem that if someone is held liable for damage, he could neither be partially li-
able nor be obliged to provide only partial compensation for the losses he caused. 
Such an &raquo; all-or-nothing approach &laquo; may be true from a purely theoretical perspec-
tive but has never been an attribute of tort law. Not only the victim&rsquo;s contributory 
negligence can lead to a reduction of damages but also court practice elaborates 
upon other doctrines as well, such as partial causation which leads to the tortfea-
sor being liable only for the part of damage that is proportionate to the degree of 
causation attributed to him. According to this approach, if the defendant&rsquo;s con-
duct as a conditio sine qua non contributed with a certain percentage to the loss of 
the victim while other circumstances also contributed ( natural facts, unidentified 
circumstances etc ), the liability of the tortfeasor shall be established only for the 
part of the loss caused by him23. Even if the liability of the tortfeasor is established 
for the whole damage, this does not necessarily mean that he shall be obliged to 
pay compensation for the entire loss he caused, because for special reasons of eq-
uity the court may grant partial exemption from liability to the person who is li-
able for the damage24.
</p>
<p>Hungarian tort law, as is true of other jurisdictions as well, is a system of open 
rules allowing great power to the courts and letting them establish and apply the 
proper guidelines to assess tort law cases. As a result of this system, a great part of 
Hungarian tort law is judge-made law, which applies a complex system of criteria to 
assess and decide tort law cases and to draw the boundaries of liability. Tort law as a 
law in action is a flexible system in the sense that has been established by Wilburg25, 
where the decision of the court results from weighing up different elements in each 
of the tort cases. This system, through the open rules of the tort law regulation, 
provides the measures to perform proper risk allocation. Grosschmid pointed out 
already at the beginning of the last century that the scales of tort law are influenced 
by many factors, such that the balance in any given case is heavily influenced by the 
specific situation. Rather than reflecting upon one sole feature, the courts&rsquo; deci-
sions depend on the complex interplay of many features of the case26.
</p>
<p>The structure of regulation does not necessarily suggest this system; written 
law can be misleading and disguise the real mechanisms and model of private law. 
The importance of written law is often overestimated and this is particularly true

<p>for tort law. Prior to codification of private law in 1959, there were two competing 
concepts developed on how tort law is to be described properly, how it works and 
what the correct model of it is. Marton proposed that fault as a subjective element 
is not an inherent part of the system of civil law liability. He went back to the roots 
of Roman law and held that fault as a prerequisite for liability comes from the mis-
understanding of the lex Aquilia. He built up a coherent system, where the under-
lying policy is that the primary function of tort law is the prevention of wrongdo-
ing. In line with this, the basic evaluation shall be that unlawfully caused losses 
are to be compensated. Certain circumstances of the case may, however, overwrite 
this basic evaluation and result in a reduction or elimination of liability. The ele-
ments which shall be assessed and taken into account in the course of establish-
ing liability and which may overwrite the basic evaluation are the weight of the 
violated interests and the interests of the wrongdoer linked with the damaging 
conduct, the capability of the defendant enterprise to spread damages among its 
customers by incorporating them in the price of its products as part of the produc-
tion costs, the degree of fault and equity27.
</p>
<p>E&ouml;rsi, whose works decisively influenced not only the theory of civil liability 
in the socialist era but also the designing of the rules covering liability in the Civil 
Code 1959, accepted that prevention should be the leading policy underlying tort 
law. E&ouml;rsi, however, in contrast to Marton, rejected the idea that the starting point 
should be that unlawfully caused losses are to be compensated. He considered 
fault as the central element of liability and built up his theory of civil liability on 
the idea that if prevention of wrongdoing is the main aim of civil law liability, then 
it is primarily the wrongful behaviour that should be addressed by law. Instead 
of Marton&rsquo;s system, defining the elements that are to be considered, weighed and 
evaluated,  E&ouml;rsi&rsquo;s  theory prevailed in the course of the preparation of the Civil 
Code 1959. The result of this was a concept of liability describing the main el-
ements of liability ( damage, unlawfulness, causal link and fault ) without deter-
mining the limiting factors or elements of evaluation, except the one referring to 
equitable grounds. Later E&ouml;rsi, revisiting and reconsidering this system, also de-
scribed and summarised the limitation doctrines that may result in dismissing a 
claim for damages28.

<p> Part 2  The law of damages within the system for the 
protection of rights and legal interests
</p>
<p>I.  In general
</p>
<p>The system for protecting rights and legal interests rests on pillars provided by 
different parts of law. There are basically two levels of division. The first division 
is the public-private divide. According to the prevailing view, public law is the law 
governing the structure and activity of the state and state organisations29, while 
private law covers legal relationships of persons acting autonomously. These parts 
of law, according to the prevailing view, have nothing to do with each other. In 
theory, practice and tort law regulation there seems to be a Chinese wall between 
public law and private law. This wall is strengthened by the concept of unlawful-
ness and fault in tort law which are independent of public law regulation. Tort law 
is built upon an autonomous concept of unlawfulness where damaging acts are 
unlawful per se and can only be regarded as lawful if such is explicitly provided by 
the law30. Thus, measures provided by public law, in order to protect the rights and 
legal interests of persons, are independent of and do not influence the measures 
provided by private law. Now, in regulation and legal theory, there is no direct link 
assumed between private law on the one hand and the Constitution31, criminal 
law or other specific legislation providing protection of rights and legal interests 
on the other hand. As far as criminal law is concerned, the procedural context 
would make such an interaction possible as victims of crime have the right to en-
force their claims in criminal procedures. Courts, however, normally, and espe-
cially if the claim is difficult to decide, separate such claims and relegate them to 
normal civil procedure.
</p>
<p>The other level of division is within private law. Each field of private law pro-
vides different tools for protecting the rights and legally protected interests of 
persons. Inherent rights of persons are protected by a complex system of claims 
available to the victim on the basis of unlawful interference with these rights. On 
the basis of factual elements of the offence, the aggrieved person has the right to

</p>

</p>
<p>claim from the court a declaration of the occurrence of the offence, to demand 
prohibition of the infringement, to demand that the perpetrator give satisfaction 
in a declaration or by some other suitable means and, if necessary, that the per-
petrator, at his own expense, make an appropriate public disclosure of this, to 
demand the termination of the unlawful situation and the restoration of his pre-
vious state at the expense of the perpetrator and, furthermore, to have the thing 
violating the inherent rights of the plaintiff destroyed or deprived of its unlawful 
nature. The Civil Code 2013 also provides for the right to claim restitution of bene-
fits gained at the price of unlawful interference according to the rules covering un-
just enrichment32. If property rights are interfered with unlawfully, the owner has 
the right to claim the thing back with a rei vindicatio or equivalent claim in land 
law. These consequences ( claims ) do not require fault or other form of wrongful-
ness but are applicable merely on the ground of the facts of the case. Liability ( for 
damages ) is seen as a general sanction of interference with rights or legally pro-
tected interests, either patrimonial or personal, if the unlawful interference with 
protected rights was the result of conduct which did not comply with the duty of 
care required by the law.
</p>
<p>II.  Claims for recovery
</p>
<p>The system of Hungarian private law is structured according to the principle that 
the main goal of the law is to promote the status required by the law. Thus, obliga-
tions are to be performed and prohibitions are to be enforced in kind, as they are. 
The law is not to provide choices to persons as to whether they fulfil their duties or 
&raquo; buy &laquo; themselves out by paying damages, but to enforce the rights and obligations 
imposed upon them. This approach is followed in contract law as well as in tort 
law and is also suggested in the system of protecting inherent rights of persons.
</p>
<p>In the structure of protection of inherent rights of persons, awarding non-
pecuniary damages is only one of the applicable sanctions and is not mentioned 
as a primary one either in the Civil Code 1959 or in the Civil Code 2013. In con-
tract law, the general rule is specific performance33 and monetary compensation 
</p>
<p>32 Civil Code 1959, &sect; 84 ( 1 ) and Civil Code 2013, &sect; 2: 51.
33 Civil Code 1959, &sect; 277 ( 1 ) provided that contracts shall be performed as stipulated, at the place 
</p>
<p>and at the time set forth and in accordance with the quantity, quality, and range specified 
therein. This provision of the Code underlies one of the basic principles of the rules of per-
formance in the Code, performance in kind. The same approach was upheld in the Civil Code 
2013 which provides that obligations are to be performed according to their content ( &sect; 6: 34 ). 
Claims for performance in kind are also explicitly provided for in the Civil Code 1959, &sect; 300 ( 1 ) 
and the Civil Code 2013, &sect; 6: 154 ( 1 ).

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>replaces enforcement of performance only if performance in kind is impossible or 
if it would not meet the interests of the creditor34. In the context of tort law, under 
the Civil Code 1959 the person responsible for the damage was liable for restoring 
the original state, or, if this was not possible or if the aggrieved party refused res-
toration on a reasonable ground, he had to pay damages to the victim to compen-
sate his pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses35. Thus, in tort law, recovery was the 
primary obligation of the liable person. In practice, however, plaintiffs normally 
claimed damages. There were actually no claims presented at courts for restora-
tion of the original state. This also holds true for contract law, where normally the 
claims are for damages and for the protection of persons, where the general rem-
edy is awarding non-pecuniary damages. The Civil Code 2013 does not maintain 
this system. It does not provide for restoration in kind as a primary duty of the li-
able person but rather the payment of damages36. The main reason for this change 
was that, in most cases, it was impossible to have restoration in kind executed. If 
this is not the case, and it is under the given circumstances reasonable to do so, 
providing redress in kind is an appropriate solution37.
</p>
<p>III.  Preventive injunctions
</p>
<p>The Civil Code 1959, as well as the Civil Code 2013, provide clear rules for ordering 
preventive injunctions. If someone creates a risk of imminent damage, the endan-
gered person is entitled to request the court to prohibit the person imposing the 
danger from continuing such conduct and / or to order such person to take suffi-
cient preventive measures and, if necessary, to provide a guarantee38. Although the 
threatening damage has to be unlawful in order for such a judgment to be passed, 
wrongfulness is not a precondition for exercising this right of the endangered per-

Force of Contract, Institute for Legal and Administrative Sciences of the Hungarian Academy 
of Sciences ( 1991 ) 29. The general principle of enforced performance is supported by other  
provisions of the Civil Code too.

</p>
<p>38 Civil Code 1959, &sect; 341 ( 1 ). According to &sect; 6: 523 of the Civil Code 2013, in the case of danger of 
suffering loss, the person in danger may ask the court, according to the circumstances of the 
case, to prohibit the person who threatens to cause damage from proceeding with dangerous 
conduct; to oblige him to implement measures to prevent the damage; or to oblige him to give 
security.

</p>
<p>son as the primary aim of this rule is preventing the occurrence of loss and not 
imposing sanctions on a wrongdoer39. Capacity of being responsible is also not 
a precondition of such a prohibitive judgment. Thus, even in the absence of rel-
evant reported court practice on this issue, one has to come to the conclusion that 
incapacity to commit torts on the part of the party endangering the other&rsquo;s per-
son or patrimony is irrelevant from the point of view of passing such a judgment. 
Prohibitive judgments can be issued against such persons as well. Claims for such 
prohibitive injunctions are also provided in specific legislation covering protec-
tion of intellectual property, competition law or consumer protection.
</p>
<p>IV.  Rights to self-defence
</p>
<p>Self-defence is qualified as a lawful act and as such, not as a basis for awarding 
damages. Any damage caused to an aggressor in order to prevent an unlawful as-
sault or a threat suggesting an unlawful direct assault will be compensated if the 
defender did not use excessive measures to avert the assault40. Compared to pre-
ventive injunctions, the rule concerning self-defence presupposes that the party 
defending his person or property causes loss to the other attacking him, while the 
claim for a preventive prohibitive judgment does not involve such facts. This is 
why there is a necessity for weighing up the position of the attacker and the party 
defending himself. The measure for this, however, is not entirely clear. The rel-
evant provision of the Civil Code requires the court to assess whether or not the 
defensive measure exceeded the degree that was necessary in order to protect the 
endangered value. This does not necessarily imply a weighing up of the protected 
interests. Weighing up the protected interests, however, seems to be unavoidable, 
because determining the necessary degree of defence requires or implies a moral 
evaluation which cannot be done without establishing such priorities. The prob-
lem of moral evaluation and ranking of interests may be presented in cases and in 
discussions of the problem of whether an owner may protect his property against 
theft by creating lethal traps for potential thieves. This highly controversial issue 
involves the problem of how the interest in protecting property and in protecting 
life, health and bodily integrity can be weighed against each other. Court prac-
tice did not accept that killing the thief with such traps, eg by leading electricity

unlawful, except if caused to an aggressor in the course of warding off an unlawful attack or the 
threat of an imminent unlawful attack insofar as such conduct did not exceed what was neces-
sary to ward off the attack; Civil Code 2013, &sect; 6: 520.

<p>to the fence, could be a lawful act41. It was certainly an important factor for the 
courts that life is a higher ranked, thus more protected, interest than property. 
The problem of self-defence, however, implies the question of a state monopoly 
on law enforcement as well. If the state wants to keep the monopoly of administra-
tion of justice, the courts have to be reluctant to accept self-defence except where 
it was clearly necessary. For this reason it is difficult to assess whether the policy 
underlying the restrictive approach of courts is the ranking of protected interests, 
guarding the state&rsquo;s monopoly of administration of justice or both.
</p>
<p>V.  Reparative injunctions
</p>
<p>Due to the approach underlying the Civil Code that the status required by the law 
shall be enforced, reparative injunctions play an important role not only in the 
system of sanctions of the Civil Code but also as part of other statutory regula-
tion belonging to private law. Reparative injunctions are to be defined as obliga-
tions imposed on the interferer to actively do something, ie remove the source of 
interference. Such sanctions are an important part of the system of protection of 
persons and intellectual property. Their basic feature is that &ndash; in contrast to dam-
ages &ndash; they have an objective nature, thus, they are to be imposed on the interferer 
in the absence of fault as well42. The only prerequisite for such an injunction is the 
unlawfulness of the interference with the plaintiff&rsquo;s protected rights.
</p>
<p>VI.  Unjust enrichment by interference
</p>
<p>The relationship between liability and unjust enrichment43 is a very difficult issue 
in the context of the law of obligations. At first sight, there may not be too many 
common features that damages and restitution share. It does, however, happen 
quite often that the profit lost by the victim of a wrongdoing can equally be de-
scribed as a gain earned by the wrongdoer to the detriment of the victim. Thus, 
the same facts can provide the basis either for a claim for damages or a claim for 
restitution. Due to this strong interrelation, before World War II, in former Hun-
garian court practice, a very close connection was postulated between tort liability 
and restitution. It was held that restitution is a kind of minimum damages which

</p>
<p>can be awarded automatically even in the absence of a direct claim if the defend-
ant earned a profit to the detriment of the plaintiff and the plaintiff claimed dam-
ages but the liability of the defendant could not be established due to absence of 
fault but the preconditions for an obligation of restitution could be met44. Today, 
in Hungarian court practice the prevailing view is that restitution can only be a 
subsidiary sanction, but it remains unclear what the meaning of this principle is. 
Courts often simply refer to this principle as a ground for rejecting the claim and 
they do it mostly if there was a contractual relationship between the parties45. The 
subsidiary nature of unjust enrichment, according to the courts, should be un-
derstood as excluding restitution if there is a legal ground for claiming damages46. 
This seems to be a misunderstanding of the legal nature and role of restitution 
and an oversimplification of the subsidiary nature of unjust enrichment. In cases 
where the claim for unjust enrichment could be formulated as a claim for dam-
ages as well, rejecting the claim for restitution on the ground that the plaintiff 
should have filed a claim for damages instead is a clearly unjust, unfounded and 
unsustainable practice.
</p>
<p>The rules of the Civil Code 1959 covering unjust enrichment allowed only a 
very narrow path for the interferer to be relieved of the obligation to restore the 
enrichment: if the interferer was deprived of the gains before they were reclaimed, 
he was not obliged to return them unless the obligation to return the gains was an 
imminent possibility and he could be held accountable for the loss of the gains, 
or the gains had been acquired in bad faith. If a person to whom any gains are due 
to be returned had created such gains through unlawful or immoral conduct, the 
court was entitled to transfer the material gains to the state at the motion of the 
public prosecutor. The Civil Code 2013 also maintains the exemption on the basis 
of change of position47 but not the possibility of awarding restitution to the state. 
Under the Civil Code 2013 such sanction can no longer be applied.
</p>
<p>There are cases, and it is in certain situations also typical, that the gain the 
tortfeasor earned as the result of wrongdoing exceeds the loss suffered by the vic-
tim. In such cases liability to compensate ( awarding damages ) does not have a 
preventive effect because it is feasible for the tortfeasor to &raquo; buy &laquo; the benefit at 
the cost of damages. If punitive damages cannot be awarded in a legal system, it 
might be a good solution in these cases to shift the benefit to the victim on the ba-
sis of unjust enrichment. That was the idea behind introducing such a solution in 
the Civil Code 2013 as a specific consequence of unlawful interference with inher-
ent rights of persons. According to this rule, if someone interferes unlawfully with

</p>
<p>the inherent rights of another, the victim shall have the right to claim the benefit 
the wrongdoer earned as the result of wrongdoing according to the rules covering 
restitution of unjust enrichment. Fault is not a prerequisite for such a claim48. The 
provision explicitly refers to the application of rules covering restitution of unjust 
enrichment. The main consideration was to provide a remedy against the press in 
cases of wrongful interference with privacy or good reputation and to prevent pub-
lishers from &raquo; buying &laquo; their profit at the price of interference with the personality 
rights of members of society. This restitutionary sanction, modelled upon similar 
solutions for sanctioning unlawful interference with intellectual property rights, 
is to be applied as an objective ( or strict ) one, ie the plaintiff shall have a claim 
for restitution even if the defendant was not at fault in unlawfully interfering. In 
the Hungarian legal system a similar solution is applied in the regulation cov-
ering intellectual property law as well as in competition law regulations49. Dam-
ages ( liability ) neither seem to provide a proper remedy in cases where directors 
breached their duty of loyalty by exploiting a profit making opportunity ( eg mak-
ing a transaction in their own name for their own profit ) owed to the company for 
themselves. It is hardly acceptable that directors could violate their duty of loyalty 
without consequences if the company were not in a position ( eg due to shortage of 
funds ) to exploit the profit making opportunity. In such cases the proper remedy 
would be to allow the company to request that the gain the director earned on the 
basis of unjust enrichment be transferred.
</p>
<p>The rule covering unjust enrichment requires that the party obliged to re-
store the gain has acquired the gain to the detriment of the plaintiff ( owner or 
otherwise entitled person ). This, however, does not necessarily mean that the 
same profit could have been earned by the entitled person. It is enough that the 
enriched party did not &raquo; buy &laquo; the position of utilising the asset by acquiring the 
title from the party to whom the asset was allocated by law. This also holds true 
if unjust enrichment was not established by utilising goods or other positions 
without entitlement but in the context of interference with inherent rights of 
persons as well.
</p>
<p>The approach, looking at restitution of unjust enrichment and liability for 
damages as complementary claims constituting one coherent system for pro-
viding remedies of corrective justice, can establish a regime which may supply a 
proper tool for private law enforcement as well.

<p>VII.  Creditors&rsquo; avoidance
</p>
<p>Actio  Pauliana  is provided in Hungarian private law to deprive the contract, or, 
more precisely, the transfer of assets of its effect vis-&agrave;-vis the creditor if the party 
acquiring the property or other rights acted in bad faith or had a gratuitous ad-
vantage originating from the contract. The consequence of such a transaction is 
that the party acquiring the property or other transferable rights has to tolerate 
the fact that the creditor of the transferor seizes the transferred asset in order to 
satisfy his claim. The interrelation between this rule and the law of damages has 
not been addressed so far. The liability or fault of the transferor is irrelevant as 
the qualification of bad faith is independent of fault. Establishing bad faith, how-
ever, implies non-compliance with the required standard of conduct, which nec-
essarily establishes fault in the context of liability. The acquirer was in bad faith 
if he knew or ought to have known that the transaction would deprive the trans-
feror&rsquo;s creditor of the coverage of his claim. Whether the acquirer ought to have 
known that the transaction would deprive the transferor&rsquo;s creditor of coverage will 
be assessed according to the required standard of conduct. The interaction with 
bankruptcy law was solved by court practice by giving priority to liquidation as 
a specific regulation ( lex specialis ); the creditor successfully enforcing his claim 
against the transferee on the basis of &raquo; actio Pauliana &laquo; shall be obliged to give this

itors according to bankruptcy law50. There is, however, no doctrine for the case if 
the creditor successfully enforces his claim vis-&agrave;-vis the transferee prior to launch-
ing the liquidation procedure.

<p>The liability of the transferee may come into the picture if he passes the thing 
( or transferable right ) to a person who did not act in bad faith and acquired the 
title for counter-value51.
</p>
<p>VIII.  Claims for damages
</p>
<p>Hungarian tort law rests on the view that damages are of a compensatory nature. 
This means that, as a principle, the victim shall be brought into a position as if the 
loss had never occurred. The victim shall not be in a position which is worse than 
before suffering the loss. This is the purpose of damages. On the other hand, he

</p>
<p>shall not be in a better position either, because this would mean that he was paid 
without entitlement and he was enriched to the detriment of the tortfeasor. It is 
a generally accepted principle that the victim should be prevented from making 
a profit on his own loss. This, however, is not expressly declared in the Civil Code, 
although it clearly follows from the concept of damage, ie that damage includes 
the actual loss, lost profits and the costs of prevention and avoidance of the loss 
and the rules covering restitution of unjust enrichment. According to this princi-
ple, in the course of calculating the sum of damages to be awarded, the amount of 
damages shall be reduced by the sum the victim earned or saved as a result of the 
damage, such as payments under the national health care system52 or an increase 
of value in the victim&rsquo;s property as a result of the damaging event. In line with 
the principle of full compensation, the plaintiff shall be compensated for all the 
losses he suffered but cannot be paid more53.
</p>
<p>This principle is in compliance with the structure and underlying policies of 
private law but in certain cases it is impossible to assess the exact sum that the 
proper compensation of the loss suffered could be. This is the case for losses in 
the future, non-pecuniary damage or cases where it is impossible to establish the 
value of the loss on any other grounds. However, the principle of full compensa-
tion and the prohibition on gaining profit from the loss should be maintained in 
such cases as well. If the problem is that the loss cannot be assessed because it is 
impossible to establish its amount, eg because it will emerge in the future, or it is 
impossible to prove it exactly on other grounds, a general assessment of damages 
may be an appropriate solution; the court will award damages that are, according 
to the conviction of the court, capable of giving compensation. Such general dam-
ages are to be awarded if the extent of damage cannot be precisely calculated. In 
such cases the person responsible for causing the damage can be ordered by the 
court to pay a general indemnification that would be sufficient to provide the vic-
tim with full monetary compensation54.
</p>
<p>If the loss cannot be assessed due its non-pecuniary character, an assessment 
of damage is not possible: expressing in money what cannot be sold on the mar-
ket due to the moral value attached to it is a contradiction. In the context of non-
pecuniary damage there are strong arguments for the position that one cannot 
speak of damage and what is to be paid as compensation cannot be damages in 
the traditional sense of this word. The theoretical starting point of this idea, fol-
lowed by the courts as well55, is that awarding non-pecuniary damages is a special

<p>sanction for wrongful interference with personality rights. This is why damage 
as a precondition of liability is replaced in the context of non-pecuniary damage 
with interference with personality rights. The aggrieved person shall be entitled 
to non-pecuniary damages without proving any actual harm, costs or loss in the 
traditional sense of the word56. This was the starting point of the legislator for the 
abolition of non-pecuniary damages and replacing them with direct compensa-
tion for pain and suffering as a specific sanction for wrongful interference with 
basic personality rights. The idea behind this change, suggested from the outset, 
was that awarding non-pecuniary damages is a specific sanction for wrongful in-
terference with basic personality rights and replacing it with this form of direct 
compensation would result in a clearer system which is free from the conceptual 
incoherence of postulating damage as a prerequisite for liability for compensating 
a loss that cannot be expressed and measured in money57.
</p>
<p>IX.  Punitive damages ?
</p>
<p>If the gain that can be earned by non-compliance with the required duty of care ex-
ceeds the damages to be paid as a consequence of wrongdoing, it is worthwhile for 
the tortfeasor to cause damage. In such a case the obligation to pay damages does 
not have a preventive effect. This is especially the case if the wrongdoer can earn 
a great profit by causing damage to a large number of persons but only a small 
amount to each of them. In such a case the risk of revealing the wrongdoing is 
small and also the chance is minimal that the victim turns to court. Thus, tort law 
will be inapt to influence the behaviour of potential wrongdoers. These situations 
point out the shortcomings of tort law. It may be argued that, for such cases, cre-
ating incentives for the victims to turn to court may promote private law enforce-
ment. If such measures are combined with public law elements, the enforcement 
of law can be effective. This problem comes to the foreground especially in com-
petition law and in consumer protection. Some legal systems solve the problem by 
awarding punitive damages. Courts, where the legal system accepts such, award 
punitive damages in order to punish the tortfeasor where compensatory damages 
do not seem to provide deterrence and a sufficient preventive effect. Punitive dam-
ages are damages which are to be paid in addition to compensatory damages and

<p>given to the plaintiff as a way of punishing the defendant58. The character of pu-
nitive damages is of an accessory as punitive damages are normally attached to 
a wrongfully committed tort establishing the defendant&rsquo;s liability and where ag-
gravating circumstances, such as deliberate or grossly negligent wrongdoing exist59. 
Punitive damages seek to make the wrongdoing more expensive than avoiding it 
for the tortfeasor and they create incentives for the prevention of harmful behav-
iour. Thus, punitive damages may be seen as an important element of the &raquo; social 
engineering &laquo; function of tort law. In Hungarian legal theory, some commentators 
qualify punitive damages as a direct and honest form of non-pecuniary damages 
including the indemnity replacing non-pecuniary damages in the new Civil Code 
201360. This is, however, a misunderstanding. Non-pecuniary damages or indem-
nity provided for the pain and suffering or other injury of inherent rights of per-
sons may be seen as a tool for providing satisfaction61 as well, but this does not 
mean that it would imply a punishment.
</p>
<p>Non-pecuniary damages are primarily of a compensatory character62 but they 
imply a redress too which helps to prevent, in general, unlawful behaviour in the 
future and helps to avoid interferences with the human dignity of others in soci-
ety63. This function, of providing redress beyond compensation, has been stressed 
in a decision of the Supreme Court awarding non-pecuniary damages to a coma-
tose plaintiff. The Court established that the victim was entitled to non-pecuniary 
damages even if he was in a coma which prevented him from enjoying any kind 
of reparation that non-pecuniary damages could have brought to him64. The new 
form of indemnity as a special sanction of wrongful interference with personality 
rights in the Civil Code 2013, replacing non-pecuniary damages, would not change 
the functions of non-pecuniary damages. The idea behind the introduction of an 
indemnity instead of non-pecuniary damages was to relieve the plaintiff of the 
burden of proving some form of detriment suffered as a result of the defendant&rsquo;s

<p>wrongful conduct and making access to indemnification easier. This, however, ac-
cording to the underlying policy of this change, would not deprive the sanction 
of its compensatory function although it may inevitably put an emphasis on its 
repressive character.
</p>
<p>The concept of damage is tightly linked with the concept of damages. Com-
pensation must be provided for any depreciation in value of the property belong-
ing to the aggrieved person and any pecuniary advantage lost due to the tortfea-
sor&rsquo;s conduct as well as compensation of the costs required for the attenuation 
or elimination of the pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss suffered by the victim. 
These provisions not only dictate the principle of full compensation but they also 
draw the limits of liability as they define damages as compensation for compen-
sable loss. Thus, in Hungarian tort law none of the forms of punitive damages can 
be awarded. Punitive damages would not necessarily be incompatible with the 
theoretical and constitutional framework of tort law or the underlying policies 
of tort law. There are, however, some axioms, primarily the axiomatic principle of 
preventing victims from gaining profits from their loss, which could be a source 
of inconsistency if any forms of punitive damages were introduced into Hungar-
ian tort law. It seems that the legislator and legal theorists are reluctant to accept 
the existence of sanctions with a criminal law character in private law. The main 
sources of this reluctance may be that sanctions of such a nature in the existing 
private law ( public penalty and disgorgement in favour of the state ) did not work 
properly and their existence has been seen as a relict of socialist state intervention 
in private law relationships, although this view may not be correct.
</p>
<p>Although punitive damages, as a form of enrichment, may not be unjust as 
they are awarded by the court ( the state ) and as such they could not be qualified as 
unjust enrichment, they conceptually would not seem to be compatible with this 
principle. Recognising punitive damages would necessarily lead to conceptual in-
consistencies in the system of Hungarian tort law. This inconsistency could be 
avoided if they were paid not to the plaintiff but to a public body for a public pur-
pose65. Such a structure may, however, result in losing one of the main advantages 
of punitive damages, namely creating private incentives for sanctioning wrong-
ful behaviour in society and may call into question the grounds for maintaining 
such system of damages. Experiences in Hungary with the public penalty would 
suggest that this is a real possibility. As we saw, however, private enforcement can 
be improved, where it is necessary, with restitutionary claims as well. Thus, there 
is no need to break up the structure and framework of private law in order to im-
prove efficiency. This line of thought is also compatible with the requirement of 
bilateral justification.

</p>
<p>It seems, however, that if the system of tort law is supplemented with unjust 
enrichment or other doctrines of disgorgement of the profit earned by the tort-
feasor at the expense of wrongdoing and is postulated as one coherent system, 
the law may provide the proper effect of deterrence and prevention without intro-
ducing punitive damages. Thus, the efficiency of private law can be improved by 
maintaining the traditional theoretical framework of private law as well. To come 
to this result, in Hungarian legal theory, the principle of subsidiarity of unjust en-
richment in the context of damages should be reconsidered.
</p>
<p>X.  Insurance contract law
</p>
<p>Insurance plays an increasingly important role in risk allocation in Hungarian 
society and the economy. One of the greatest benefits of insurance may be that it 
not only shifts the risk but also spreads it among the members of the group of so-
ciety exposed to the same risk. As the insurance company has a right of recourse 
against the person liable for damage compensated on the basis of insurance, on 
the basis of an assignment by law66, the preventive effect of the liability system 
can be maintained. In such a system, insurance does not eliminate or consider-
ably impede the deterrent function of tort law. The negative effect of insurance on 
the preventive effect of tort law is not necessarily true even in those cases where 
this recourse right cannot be enforced. Third-party insurance policies are quite of-
ten concluded with risk-bearers who are, in many cases, not the actual tortfeasors, 
like motor vehicle operators or employers. As far as compulsory third-party mo-
tor vehicle insurance is concerned, potential tortfeasors also expose themselves to 
the risk of personal injury if they are negligent and, if they cause a traffic accident, 
they have to face criminal liability as well; it is very doubtful whether they consider 
the existence of insurance coverage while making choices in traffic or maintain-
ing their vehicle.
</p>
<p>66 Such statutory assignment is provided in the Civil Code 1959 for first-party and for third-party 
insurance as well: Civil Code 1959, &sect; 558 ( 1 ) and &sect; 559 ( 3 ). The Civil Code 2013, &sect; 6: 468 does pro-
vide this right for first-party insurance but there is no explicit rule providing this right for third- 
party insurance. It is still not clear if it is to be understood that the recourse claim, as a general 
rule, is provided for all types of loss-based insurance ( which is the preferable interpretation ) 
or it is to be restricted to first-party insurance. As such rights can be provided in the case of 
third-party insurance in the insurance contract as a claim of the insurance company against the 
insured person as well, the statutory regulation may be of a minor importance in this context.

<p>XI.  Social security law
</p>
<p>In the socialist era, a comprehensive system of social security was built up and 
this is still functioning, although it provides &ndash; in order to create incentives for 
people to go back to work as soon as possible &ndash; only a partial compensation for 
lost salary. If the personal injury suffered by the victim was partially compensated 
from the social security budget, courts reduced and continue to reduce the dam-
ages awarded to him on the grounds of the prohibition of making a profit on the 
loss. The principle of full compensation implies that the awarded compensation 
shall be reduced in accordance with damage that has already been reimbursed 
from other sources ( payments from national health insurance, disability pen-
sions, earnings on the loss, etc )67. In this sense social security law and tort law 
supplement each other.
</p>
<p>As a general rule, the right of recourse under the publicly financed national 
health care insurance system is covered by the rules of Act no LXXXIII of 1997 on 
the Services of the Compulsory Health Insurance System. This regulation pro-
vides for a right of recourse in respect of services paid by the National Health Care 
Insurance Fund. As a general rule, the tortfeasor liable for the illness, lost work-
ing capacity, injury or death of the beneficiary of the public health care services is 
obliged to reimburse the cost of services provided on this basis from the Health 
Care Insurance Fund where liability is established according to the general rules 
of liability in tort. This provision was presumably not designed for the right of 
recourse in cases where the patient suffered harm in the course of medical treat-
ment and another social welfare agency contributed to his care or well-being. If, 
however, the social welfare agency that provided the treatment was part of the 
public health care insurance system, there is no reason to exclude the application 
of this rule. If the social welfare agency contributing to the care or well-being of a 
patient was not part of the national health care insurance system, such rights of 
recourse are to be assessed under general private law, especially the law of torts 
and unjust enrichment. If the services were provided under private insurance, the 
general rules for the right of recourse of private insurers provided in the Civil 
Code are to be applied.

</p>
<p>XII.  Compensating victims of crimes and catastrophes
</p>
<p>Creating and maintaining specific compensation schemes is a question of policy: 
it is the choice of the state to decide if social resources shall be used to compen-
sate certain groups of members of society and if so, which type of risks are to be 
covered in such a manner. As far as catastrophes are concerned, there is no gen-
eral compensation scheme. In specific acts for certain natural or industrial catas-
trophes68 partial compensation is provided, mostly in the form of building houses 
or giving financial aid. As far as victims of crimes are concerned, there is a regula-
tory compensation system provided in Act no CXXXV of 2005 on giving help to the 
victims of crimes and mitigating their loss. Under this statutory compensation 
scheme, persons suffering serious personal injury or death as a result of a delib-
erate crime against their life and bodily integrity are entitled to receive compen-
sation from the state budget. The compensation to be provided is a progressively 
decreasing part of the loss suffered.
</p>
<p>XIII.  Disgorgement claims
</p>
<p>Disgorgement in favour of the state is a solution to deprive persons of illicit gains 
if restitution should not be allowed on grounds of public policy. For example, if a 
contract is invalid and one of the parties performed the contract at least partially, 
the performing party, as a general rule, is entitled to restitution of the performance. 
A general problem of contract law ( and the same holds true for the law of restitu-
tion in general ) is whether the performing party, whose conduct under the contract 
was contrary to public policy, ie it was unlawful conduct or conduct contra bonos 
mores, should be denied restitution. In cases of illegality, there are special policy 
issues which would be against the allowance of restitution. Firstly, as a traditional 
and general principle of private law, no one should be allowed to gain a profit from 
their own wrongdoing69; secondly, allowing restitution would not have a preventive 
effect against conduct contra bonos mores and even if prevention or deterrence 
are, in general, not the underlying policies of contract law or unjust enrichment, 
it is widely accepted that it is desirable to prevent persons from illegal or immoral 
conduct; thirdly, enforcing restitutionary claims arising from performance of an

and lost their homes.

</p>
<p>illegal contract makes it necessary for the courts to go into the detail of the case 
in evidence to decide the legal ground of the claim which may offend the dignity 
of the courts. It seems that even if rejecting the restitutionary claims of parties be-
ing in pari delicto may protect the dignity of the courts and may provide enough 
deterrent and preventive effects, the result of allowing the other party to keep the 
benefits of the performance, even if he also was in pari delicto, cannot be held to be 
satisfactory at all. If the parties are equally at fault owing to their mutual contract 
for an illegal purpose, it is a very questionable result that the transferee may keep 
the transferred benefit even though, by entering into the contract, he acted equally 
or more wrongfully than the plaintiff did. The Civil Code 1959 solved the problem by 
introducing a new sanction of invalidity into the Hungarian law. According to this 
purely repressive sanction, the court was entitled to award to the state the perfor-
mance that was due to a party who had concluded a contract which was contrary to 
good morals, who deceived or illegally threatened the other party or who otherwise 
proceeded fraudulently70. A similar rule was applied for disgorgement of the resti-
tutionary value to the state under the unjust enrichment regime71.
</p>
<p>One weak point of this solution lay in its procedural aspects: it was not obvi-
ous at all how courts could award the benefit to the state in a procedure between 
two parties who would surely not propose such a decision. To award the benefit to 
the state without a claim would be incompatible with the nature of civil law litiga-
tion. This procedural problem has been overcome by giving the public prosecu-
tor the right to claim that the state be awarded the benefit which would otherwise 
have been passed to the transferee72. According to the procedural rules, if in civil 
law litigation the possibility that an award could be made to the state arose, the 
court was obliged ex officio to take note and to notify the public prosecutor of 
the possibility of applying this sanction in order to make it possible for the pub-
lic prosecutor to step in. The restitutionary benefit could then be awarded to the 
state on the claim of the Public Attorney. This claim was a procedural precondi-
tion for such a decision.
</p>
<p>The Civil Code 201373 abandoned this special sanction of disgorgement in fa-
vour of the state. The main arguments for this proposal are the punitive character 
of it, which was held to be incompatible with the structure and nature of the civil 
law and that it was applied very rarely and unsuccessfully.

<p>XIV.  Criminal law
</p>
<p>Criminal law plays an important role in the protection of rights and legal inter-
ests of persons, which is the task of the law as a whole. It is often said that one 
of the differences between criminal law and private law is that the basic aim of 
criminal law is deterrence, while the basic aim of private law is providing restitu-
tion or compensation in the case of unlawful interference with protected rights of 
others. This view may be correct on a certain level but the ultimate goal of law in 
general is to influence the behaviour of members of society and this is common 
in private law and in criminal law as well. On this level, the main goal of private 
law and criminal law is the same: preventing wrongdoing. Criminal law and pri-
vate law can be closely connected on the level of procedural law as well; compen-
sation claims may be judged and damages may be awarded by the criminal court, 
via criminal procedures, to the victims of crimes. Although criminal courts are re-
luctant to use this opportunity and leave the claim for damages to the civil courts, 
this may lead to the development of a new area of tort law in Europe as well, paral-
lel to the claims under the Alien Tort Claims Act in the United States. If criminal 
law allows plaintiffs to bring cases to the court where a foreign citizen committed 
crimes in another country against people there ( especially for violations of human 
rights ), this may open the way for deciding claims for damages in these cases as 
well74.

<p> Part 3 The tasks of tort law
</p>
<p>I.  Compensatory function
</p>
<p>The compensatory function of tort law was always beyond doubt in Hungarian 
legal theory and court practice. The starting point of the Civil Code 1959 was that 
providing compensation is directly addressed by civil law liability while preven-
tion is an indirect function of tort law. It is in line with the structure of private law 
and the market that primarily private law has to provide reparation of injustice, 
restoring the disturbed balance of patrimonial relationships. This is clearly estab-
lished with the principle of full compensation: damages are to bring the victim 
into the same position as if the damage had not occurred75. The compensatory 
function of tort law is less obvious in the context of non-pecuniary damages. Non-
pecuniary damages are to be paid for losses that are not transferable rights and 
are not capable of being expressed in money. Thus, it seems that the law should 
measure in money something that cannot be measured in money, which makes 
it unclear how they should be calculated in order to provide compensation or 
whether this is possible at all. Due to this contradictory nature of non-pecuniary 
damages, in Hungary it is now considered that non-pecuniary loss is not damage 
in the traditional sense of the word and non-pecuniary damages are not paid as 
compensation but much more as a redress or satisfaction.
</p>
<p>II.   Function of deterrence and continuation of a right 
( Rechtsfortsetzungsfunktion )
</p>
<p>According to the view underlying Hungarian tort law rules, the primary goal of 
tort law is providing compensation. Prevention is a secondary role but these two 
aims are tightly connected and cannot be seen independently of each other. The 
compensation provided to the victim also has a deterrence function ie to deter 
others in society from doing wrong. Providing compensation improves the pro-
tection of members of society, while deterrence aims to prevent wrongdoing76. No-
tions of continuation of a right or equivalent doctrines are not established in Hun-

<p>garian tort law. In the course of assessing damage, courts and legal theory refer 
directly to the principle of full compensation and to the principle of not enriching 
the victim who suffered the loss. Courts try to assess damage on an objective basis 
but they do so without referring to the continuation of rights.
</p>
<p>III.  Penalty function
</p>
<p>A penal function has never been accepted as part of Hungarian tort law. Although 
penalties may support or supplement tort law in order to achieve the goal of pre-
vention, tort law itself does not have such a function.
</p>
<p>In establishing the private law consequences of unlawful interference with 
personality rights, the Civil Code 1959 provided77 that if the defendant interfered 
wrongfully with the plaintiff&rsquo;s inherent rights and the sum to be awarded as dam-
ages would not be proportionate to the gravity of the wrongfulness of the tortfea-
sor&rsquo;s conduct, the court could impose on the defendant a fine to be devoted to a 
public purpose78. The underlying policy behind this repressive sanction was the 
recognition of the fact that, in cases of gross infringements of the plaintiff&rsquo;s per-
sonality rights, damages may not properly transmit the social evaluation of the 
wrongful conduct and this would not result in a proper level of protection of per-
sonality rights and prevention79. This specific penalty was not successful as courts 
were reluctant to apply it and it was not upheld in the Civil Code 2013.
</p>
<p>There are arguments in Hungarian tort law theory that there is a penalty func-
tion attached to non-pecuniary damages and to the indemnity compensation to 
be introduced in the Civil Code 2013 as a specific sanction for wrongful interfer-
ence with inherent rights replacing non-pecuniary damages. This is, however, a 
misunderstanding of punitive damages and a wrong approach which qualifies sat-
isfaction or redress as a punishment. The new sanction of indemnity compensa-
tion introduced in the Civil Code 2013 is not attached to damages but is a direct 
consequence of wrongful interference with inherent rights of persons. This, how-
ever, does not mean that it has a punitive character.
</p>
<p>It may be an inapt approach to use only compensation and punishment in 
order to describe the functions of damages. Just and fair satisfaction or redress 
should or could also be postulated as autonomous functions of damages. Pro-

<p>viding satisfaction does not mean compensation, because it does not restore the 
original state but neither is it punishment because it is to be paid in order to give 
something as an &raquo; exchange &laquo; for the loss and it does not necessarily depend on the 
degree of fault of the tortfeasor. This is well presented in the system established 
by the European Convention on Human Rights: the European Court of Human 
Rights may order the state to pay a just and fair satisfaction as a consequence of 
non-compliance with the duties established in the Convention. This satisfaction 
is not to compensate the plaintiff, because it is not to restore the plaintiff&rsquo;s loss 
and to bring him into a position as if the interference with human rights had not 
occurred but rather it is about giving him something in order to mitigate or elimi-
nate the consequences of wrongful interference with his protected rights and to 
prevent the state from doing this again. Thus, the proper view might be that this 
supplements the system of possible functions of tort law and that such is to pro-
vide compensation, punishment or ( just ) satisfaction. Non-pecuniary damages 
and the indemnity compensation replacing them in Hungarian tort law have the 
function of providing just and fair satisfaction; they are not compensation, be-
cause they are not to be paid as a money equivalent of the loss caused. They are 
not, however, punishment either, because primarily they are not to be paid in or-
der to impose a sanction on the wrongdoer but to give something to the victim in 
order to eliminate or reduce the loss he suffered.
</p>
<p>IV.  Economic optimisation ?
</p>
<p>Economic analysis of law may provide important insights on how tort law works 
and which effects it may have. The literature of law and economics delivers im-
portant and useful results and court practice can also develop and apply legal 
solutions presenting the same way of thinking, as has been done by the famous 
American judge, Learned Hand when he established the &raquo; Hand &laquo;-rule80 long before 
the flourishing of the economic analysis of law. The efficiency based approach 
may lead to the conclusion that prevention is the main function of tort law and 
punitive damages may be a useful tool for improving this, especially where private 
( law ) enforcement comes to the foreground81.
</p>
<p>A general principle of Hungarian tort law is that no-one shall be enriched by 
his own damage. It seems that restitutionary damages or claims for a shifting of 
the gain from the tortfeasor to the victim in order to deprive the tortfeasor of the

patible with the principles and policies underlying tort law82.
</p>
<p>Economic analysis of law, however, does not play a significant role in Hungar-
ian court practice and in legal theory, although it could be an important source 
for improving the theory of tort law in the Hungarian jurisdiction as well. The ap-
proach that a causal link may be established on the basis of increased probabil-
ity ( making theories of causation superfluous ), considering loss of a chance as 
damage or a natural cause, assessment of damage, especially pure economic loss, 
establishing fault ( Hand formula ), understanding strict liability, the role of insur-
ance, etc, are only some of the important fields and problems of tort law where 
economic analysis may bring important results in order to improve tort law theory 
and practice.

</p>
<p> Part 4  The area between tort and breach of an 
obligation
</p>
<p>I.  Tort, breach of contract and an interim area
</p>
<p>The underlying policy behind the regulation of damages in the Civil Code 1959 was 
providing a unified system of liability. This idea included the unitary regulation 
of liability for torts and breach of contract83. This solution reinforces the idea that 
the moral basis of liability is common, as it is always a breach of an obligation, 
whether the obligation rests on a contractual promise or in the law itself. It makes 
the system simpler as well, as it avoids borderline problems and the necessity 
of classification. This structure eliminated the problems resulting from the fluid 
transition area between tort and breach of contract. Due to this structure, prob-
lems of delimitation have not emerged in Hungarian court practice and establish-
ing the strict point of time of conclusion of a contract has not been a key issue.
</p>
<p>The Civil Code 2013 has not maintained this unified system. On implement-
ing the system of liability for breach of contract provided in the CISG ( United Na-
tions Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ), the legislator 
decided to introduce the foreseeability limit as a statutory limitation of liability 
for breach of contract in Hungarian contract law84. Moreover, the preconditions of 
exoneration have also been designed differently. Proving compliance with the re-
quired standard of conduct is not enough for the party breaching the contract to 
be relieved of liability; instead he has to prove that the breach was due to circum-
stances unforeseen at the time of contracting, that fell outside his scope of control 
and that he could not have been expected to avoid the circumstances or prevent 
the loss it caused85. This necessarily results in breaking up the logic of the unified 
system of liability and also results in a system of non-cumulation86. The idea be-
hind introducing the foreseeability limit and creating different regimes of liability 
was that, in the case of a contract, the duty is undertaken by the party voluntarily 
as part of a bargain. The bargain reflects market mechanisms only if the obliga-
tion was undertaken by a properly informed party because only risks that were re-

<p>vealed can be priced by the parties in an exchange. The legislator wanted to create 
a system which induces the parties to disclose risks if they want to make such part 
of the bargain. The separate regulation of liability in tort and liability for breach 
of contract will create problems of delimitation.
</p>
<p>Due to the unified system of liability in tort and liability for breach of con-
tract, the question of whether they represent different levels of protection or are 
built upon different inner logic and structures did not arise. The new structure 
of liability separating tort and breach of contract will pave the way for such ques-
tions. Structurally it is built upon the assumption that it is always possible to draw 
a clear line between situations where there is a contract between the parties and 
where there is not. In the chain of steps leading to the conclusion of a contract, 
a point of time of contracting is postulated. Assuming a valid contract, after this 
point of time there are contractual rights and obligations between the parties, 
while before that, there are not. As cases of both consumer contracting and com-
mercial contracts show, the picture is not always that clear. As experiences of juris-
dictions not allowing cumulation of claims show, it is difficult to assess. Providing 
the proper model of consumer mass transaction may still cause problems today 
( eg the decisive final moment of contracting, shrink wrap licenses, etc ). Merg-
ers and acquisitions are based on transactions which are the result of a sophisti-
cated process involving many steps. In cases of contracts for developing software, 
it quite often occurs that defining the content of the contract, the performance, re-
quires cooperation between the parties. The seller actually often already starts to 
perform at a stage which is still to be seen as a preparatory phase prior to contract-
ing. In the deal-is-on-philosophy of commercial contracting, if the parties agreed 
that performance is to be started by any of them, the conclusion of the contract 
can be established even in the absence of an agreement upon the price. A further 
problem is that a duty of care vis-&agrave;-vis the other party can also be established by 
the law ( eg not to cause damage to property of others ) triggering liability in tort 
and this has been clarified by the general rule of the Civil Code 2013 that causing 
damage unlawfully shall be prohibited by law87. These examples and many others 
show that a clear line between contractual obligations and duties imposed by the 
law on the parties cannot always be drawn.

<p>II.  Groups of cases in the interim area
</p>
<p>Thus, an interim area between tort and breach of contractual obligation does exist. 
Prospectus liability did not emerge as a specific group of cases of this interim area 
of contract law, nor has the problem of the relationship of the parties and court-ap-
pointed expert witnesses been addressed in Hungarian court practice or theory so 
far. Similarly, no doctrine on culpa in contrahendo has been elaborated. Non-com-
pliance with the duty of care in regard of a partner&rsquo;s person and property and of pure 
economic interests triggers liability in tort. Due to the unified system of contractual 
liability and liability in tort, the fact that such duties imposed on the party by the 
law emerged in a pre-contracting phase did not make a difference for the courts.
</p>
<p>Cases of culpa in contrahendo are not covered by specific provisions. It is explic-
itly provided that contracting parties shall be obliged, also before contracting and 
including the contractual negotiations, to cooperate and disclose to each other every 
relevant circumstance of the contract88. This is a general duty of disclosure concre-
tising the principle of good faith and fair dealing for contracting situations. The 
consequence of non-compliance with this duty is a claim for damages in tort. E&ouml;rsi 
emphasises that in Hungarian tort law there is no gap that should be filled by the 
culpa in contrahendo doctrine. He explicitly refers to the basic norm of liability pro-
vided in the Civil Code 1959, &sect; 339, the principle of good faith and fair dealing and 
the duty to cooperate in the Civil Code 1959, &sect; 4 ( 2 ) in order to establish liability for 
cases qualified as culpa in contrahendo in German court practice and literature89.
</p>
<p>In Hungarian court practice, a specific group of cases has emerged where the 
court had to decide whether costs of tendering must be compensated if a tender 
is cancelled. The question was whether a party making a bid or a tender had the 
right to have his costs compensated if the tender was cancelled or revoked and the 
costs of making the bid were spent in vain. It has been made clear that if the invi-
tation or the decision on the tender was unlawful, this unlawfulness establishes 
the liability of the offeree according to the general rule for fault-based liability in 
tort. This liability, however, covers only the compensation for the costs of prepar-
ing and submitting the bid ( negatives Interesse ) but does not cover compensating 
the bidder for lost profits. In these cases, a causal link can never be established90.
</p>
<p>88 Civil Code 1959, &sect; 205 ( 4 ).
89 According to E&ouml;rsi, in German legal theory and practice it was necessary to develop such a doc-
</p>
<p>trine because of the gap the rules of liability for tort and for breach of contract left in the BGB. 
Because of the general clause of liability in the Civil Code 1959, &sect; 339 such a gap does not exist 
in Hungarian private law. Since these cases are covered by the Civil Code 1959, &sect; 339, it was not 
necessary to develop such a doctrine. Gy. E&ouml;rsi, Elhat&aacute;rol&aacute;si probl&eacute;m&aacute;k az anyagi felelőss&eacute;g

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>A specific group of cases, still belonging to the interim area, is  liability  for 
information. Allocation of information is one of the most sensitive problems of 
contract law. The decision of an uninformed party is not a free choice, which may 
mean that the market as the economic environment of the contract was imperfect. 
Sustaining free choice and market mechanisms would justify a requirement to en-
sure that the parties are in a properly informed position. Information asymmetry 
may be seen as a market failure which should be corrected. On the other hand, a 
general obligation to share all information possessed by the parties would dis-
courage investing in the production of information which would entail the con-
sequences of impeding innovation. Up to a certain extent all of the legal systems 
provide, impliedly or explicitly, for establishing a duty of disclosure in the pre-
contracting stage while they also try to set the boundaries of this obligation. The 
Civil Code 1959 explicitly required parties to inform each other on all the relevant 
circumstances of the contract and the rule has been retained in the Civil Code 
201391. The consequence of non-compliance with this duty may be a ground for 
unenforceability of the contract for mistake or misrepresentation and / or it may 
be a basis for damages in tort or a remedy for breach of contract as an alternative 
to unenforceability for mistake or misrepresentation.
</p>
<p>In cases where the party ( typically the seller ) provides information regarding 
the product to be the subject of the contract, the information requirement may be 
inferred as a contractual term and as being part of the contract92. This construc-
tion establishes the contractual liability of the party if the product fails to meet 
the alleged quality. In such cases unenforceability of the contract on the ground 
of error, misrepresentation or deceit and a remedy for breach of contract are alter-
native claims open to the plaintiff. Unenforceability of the contract excludes the 
liability for breach of contract; unenforceability of the contract does not, however, 
exclude the claim in tort or on the basis of induced behaviour ( Civil Code 1959, &sect; 6 ).
</p>
<p>In the Civil Code 2013, creating different regimes for tort and for breach of 
contract also required a specific regulation of culpa in contrahendo. According 
to this new regime, if a party fails to comply with the required duty of coopera-
tion and duty of disclosure in the pre-contractual stage, his liability depends on 
whether the contract had been concluded or not. If the contract had been con-
cluded, his liability falls under the regime of liability for breach of contract; if the 
contract had not been concluded, his liability falls under tort law93. The duty of 
cooperation and disclosure of relevant facts is provided in the Civil Code 2013 as 
a general duty imposed on the negotiating parties independently of whether the

<p>contract is ultimately concluded or not. It is the regime of liability which is differ-
ent if a party failed to comply with such a duty. If the contract had been concluded, 
the new regulation extends the scope of the contract in this context to the pre-
contractual stage.
</p>
<p>III.  The problem of concurrent claims
</p>
<p>The liability system of the Civil Code 1959 allowed the concurrence of contrac-
tual and non-contractual ( tort ) liabilities. Court practice in Hungary also seemed 
to accept the concurrence of contractual and non-contractual liability. The Civil 
Code 1959, &sect; 318 provided that, as far as liability for breach of contract is con-
cerned, the same rules were to apply as for liability in tort with the exception that 
the court did not have the right to reduce liability on equitable grounds. The basis 
of liability in contract and in tort was different as it was the breach of the contrac-
tual duty in contract and non-compliance with the implied general prohibition of 
causing harm to others in tort; but beyond and in spite of this difference, the ap-
plicable rules for damages were the same. Due to this unified system, it was pri-
marily a question of argumentation for establishing the claim ( for the party ) and 
the judgment ( for the court ) on breach of contract or on tort. The plaintiff was 
not prevented from having a claim in tort even if the defendant&rsquo;s conduct which 
caused harm was a breach of contract. Moreover, since in Hungarian case law the 
court shall not be bound to the title represented by the plaintiff as a ground for 
his claim, the court may consider, even without any request by the parties, the 
preconditions of tort liability as well even if the plaintiff relied only on the defend-
ant&rsquo;s breach of contract94. Earlier court practice was somewhat confusing, since 
decisions were often based on the general rule of liability95 and not on the special 
rule for contractual liabilities96, even in cases of contractual liability. At the begin-
ning of the seventies, a tendency could already be detected towards preferring the 
contractual basis in cases of concurrent grounds for liability97. This tendency has 
developed to a clear standpoint. If there was concurrence of contractual and non-
contractual ( tort ) liability, courts in contractual cases applied the specific rule 
for contractual liability by referring to the general rule of liability in tort as well 
and deciding cases on the basis of contractual liability98. One obvious and signifi-

<p>cant difference had, however, been clearly developed in court practice. This differ-
ence was the application of different measures for exculpation as in contractual 
cases courts applied stricter tests in the course of assessing whether the tortfea-
sor had acted as would be generally expected under the given circumstances. They 
allowed exculpation only if the defendant could prove that the harm under the 
given circumstances would have been unavoidable99. This tendency and the obvi-
ous difference in relationship of the contracting parties on the one hand and non-
contractual situations on the other hand, which also involved different limitation 
measures such as the foreseeability doctrine for contractual damages, led the 
Hungarian legislator to the conviction that the unified system should be replaced 
by the division of contractual and non-contractual liability, even if they would ba-
sically remain congruent with respect to the measure of damages. Regulations on 
compensation, with the exception that the scope of the foreseeability principle is 
somewhat different, are also the same for contractual and for non-contractual li-
ability in the Civil Code 2013. The system in the Civil Code 1959 did not prevent 
the court from establishing non-contractual liability if the wrongdoer&rsquo;s conduct 
could be qualified as a breach of contract but at the same time, independently 
of the contractual obligations undertaken by the defendant or other persons, it 
could be qualified as a wrongful act resulting in liability in tort as well. In such 
cases the plaintiff could choose the basis of his claim100. The separate regulation 
of liability in tort and for breach of contract in the Civil Code 2013 does not make 
this possible due to the &raquo; non-cumulation &laquo; principle. This system follows a clear 
logic but will presumably create many problems of delimitation in practice in the 
course of the application of the Civil Code 2013101.

<p> Part 5 The basic criteria for a compensation claim
</p>
<p>I.  Damage
</p>
<p>Socialist theorists, namely E&ouml;rsi, stressed the preventive function of tort law and 
put wrongfulness at the centre of the system of tort law instead of damage. This 
may be a reason why damage never became a central issue of tort law in legal 
theory. The concept of damage in Hungarian tort law is defined with damages. 
The tortfeasor who is responsible for the damage shall be liable for restoring the 
original state, or, if this is not possible or if the aggrieved person on a reason-
able ground refuses restoration, he shall compensate the victim for pecuniary and 
non-pecuniary damage. Compensation must be provided for any depreciation in 
the value of the property belonging to the victim ( damnum emergens ) and any 
pecuniary advantage lost due to the tortfeasor&rsquo;s conduct ( lucrum cessans ) as well 
as compensation of the costs necessary for the attenuation or elimination of the 
victim&rsquo;s pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss102. The concept of lost pecuniary advan-
tage as a specific type of damage also implies that damage is a legal and not a nat-
ural concept103. Neither an economic definition nor concept has been elaborated 
or applied in court practice or legal theory. The distinction between recoverable 
and non-recoverable loss is implied in court practice, although this distinction 
has also never been elaborated in court practice or in legal theory. Losses, however, 
of gains which are to be deemed morally unacceptable are not to be compensated, 
although it may be difficult to assess if losses are morally acceptable or not. It is 
still not clear whether gratuities104 paid to a doctor is a compensable loss but the 
tendency seems to be to accept that it is so. In a decision, the Supreme Court re-
jected a claim for awarding compensation to a patient for gratuities paid by him

104 Doctors working as employees of public health care providers ( hospitals ) normally receive 
</p>
<p>gratuities from patients. The basis of this &raquo; custom &laquo; is the general necessity of compensating 
doctors for their generally low level of salary. This type of income has always been morally 
questionable and doctors are also divided on this. Some of them expect to get such an extra 
payment while others refuse it on moral grounds. Doctors are obliged to provide services to 
patients according to the highest possible level without demanding or getting any extra fee 
from patients. Doctors working under the Public Health Insurance Service system are not sup-
posed to ask for any kind of extra payment, fee or other material advantage as a counter-value 
for their services to the patient and they are prohibited from subjecting their services to the 
condition of getting such material advantages. Doctors working as employees of hospitals are 
obliged to do their work on the basis of this relationship but they are not prohibited from ac-
cepting such gratuities after the treatment.

<p>to a doctor but declared that such payments should not be deemed illegal. Accord-
ing to the judgment, such gratuities are not prohibited and should not be deemed 
illegal payments insofar as they are paid at the personal discretion of patients105.
</p>
<p>According to the prevailing view in Hungary, compensating non-pecuniary 
loss does not fit into the concept of damage. It was the idea of the legislator in 
1959, in line with the legal theory of former private law, that there was neither a 
need to accept non-pecuniary damages nor was it coherent, as values that could 
not be expressed in money could not be compensated. Thus, the concept of non-
pecuniary damages suffered from serious inherent contradiction. The protection 
of such values should and can be provided properly in public law, especially in 
criminal law. It was also believed that interference with non-pecuniary interests 
mostly involved interference with pecuniary ones. This left the way open for the 
courts to award higher compensation amounts for pecuniary loss if non-pecuni-
ary values were also interfered with, in the form of general damages which then 
implied compensation for the violation of the non-pecuniary interests too. This 
view proved to be unsustainable in the longer run and in 1977 the Civil Code 1959 
was amended with provisions covering non-pecuniary damages. These provisions, 
in order to exclude insignificant interference with protected interests from the 
compensation regime, required a certain level of violation of interests in order for 
one to get interference compensated. In 1992 the Hungarian Constitutional Court 
established that imposing restrictions on the availability of non-pecuniary dam-
ages provided a lower level of protection for inherent rights of persons than was 
required and declared these provisions incompatible with the Constitution106.
</p>
<p>Court practice clearly tended to require wrongful interference with the victim&rsquo;s 
inherent rights as a necessary precondition for awarding non-pecuniary damages. 
This view is also supported by the Civil Code 2013 which abolishes non-pecuniary 
damages and replaces them with a direct indemnification regime as a specific 
sanction for wrongful interference with personality rights. It is expected that this 
form of direct compensation should result in a clearer system which is free from 
conceptual incoherence when it comes to speaking of damage as a prerequisite 
for liability for compensating a loss that cannot be expressed and measured in 
money107. As is accepted both in theory and practice, the basis of compensable 
non-pecuniary loss is the unlawful interference with the inherent rights of the per-
son. The question is only whether wrongful interference with personality rights is 
a non-pecuniary loss per se to be compensated by awarding non-pecuniary dam-
ages, as has been stressed in prevailing theory and in the preparatory materials for 
the Civil Code ( 2013 ), or whether an additional manifest disadvantage is required

</p>
<p>as has been stressed in some decisions of the Supreme Court108. The new form of 
indemnification, based on a similar concept to Schmerzensgeld, does not require 
a manifest disadvantage to be suffered by the victim. The amount awarded is to 
be established by the court having regard to the circumstances of the case, espe-
cially the gravity of the interference with the victim&rsquo;s inherent rights, whether the 
wrongdoing happened repeatedly, the level of fault of the wrongful conduct and 
the impact of the interference on the victim and on the victim&rsquo;s environment109.
</p>
<p>The Civil Code 1959 and the Civil Code 2013 both protect inherent rights of 
persons with a general clause. From this follows that there is no need to refer to 
certain specific rights interfered with in order to establish wrongful interference 
with inherent rights of persons. These rights are generally protected by the law 
whether defined specifically in the Civil Code or other legislation or not. From 
the general approach that wrongful interference with inherent rights of a person 
may establish non-pecuniary damage, it followed already in the course of applica-
tion of the Civil Code 1959 as well that there was no need for specifically defined 
protected interests in order to award non-pecuniary damages. As, however, non-
pecuniary damages were a special sanction of wrongful interference with person-
ality rights, there was, in this context, a difference between damage to &raquo; persons &laquo; 
and damage to property.
</p>
<p>As to the assessment of the amount of damages, the general approach was 
that the court has to consider all the circumstances of the case. It was also ac-
cepted in Hungarian court practice and legal theory that non-pecuniary loss can-
not be expressed in money.
</p>
<p>The level of compensation awarded for non-pecuniary loss was very low in 
the socialist era but currently presents a steadily increasing trend. However, it 
does not match up to the sums awarded in societies with higher standards of liv-
ing. This may be a source of tension on a European level. Courts try to adjust the 
amounts awarded to the general ability of society to bear such burdens ( in order 
not to make insurance too expensive and to avoid making the price and cost of 
services too high through the incorporation of insurance premiums ). There is no 
catalogue for calculating the amount of non-pecuniary losses although in practice 
it works similarly to the calculation of compensation in insurance practice. Courts 
try to award similar amounts of compensation for similar non-pecuniary losses 
in compliance with the basic structural principle of equal treatment of equal sit-
uations, taking into account the relevant personal circumstances and peculiari-
ties as well and awarding higher sums for a violation of an interest protected to a

<p>higher degree110. There are no fixed, suggested or even published sums and there 
may be considerable differences in the practice of lower courts which makes pre-
dictability difficult.
</p>
<p>The question of who can claim compensation for non-pecuniary loss is a sen-
sitive one in all legal systems. Some decades ago the starting point of the Hun-
garian court practice on this issue was that grief and pain arising from the loss 
of a relative itself is not a sufficient basis for compensable non-pecuniary loss111; 
this approach has, however, been changing. Today, claims for compensation of 
non-pecuniary loss of close relatives of the deceased person are accepted in court 
practice112, although their scope is limited. The ground for awarding damages to 
relatives is the loss of the victim, ie their protected interest in their right to live in 
a complete and healthy family. For this reason, in court practice parents, minor 
children, spouses and brothers are entitled to damages arising from the death of 
the victim. For such relatives the bereavement itself is the basis for claiming com-
pensation for non-pecuniary loss113. Courts are not inclined to widen this circle 
and have rejected claims of grandparents as well as those of an adult child who 
no longer lived together with the victim114. If the case does not concern the loss of 
a relative but rather the loss suffered by the relative ( eg personal injury or health 
damage ), the relatives of the direct victim may have a claim for non-pecuniary 
damages as compensation for their own personal loss ( eg for giving birth to a 
child with a cognitive disability )115.
</p>
<p>Thus, in Hungarian legal theory and practice, non-pecuniary damages were 
not compensation for emotional distress but compensation for wrongful interfer-
ence with rights ( ie personality rights ). Emotional distress, shock, pain, suffering, 
bad feelings, frustrated expectations, and lost experiences might not be sufficient 
ground to award non-pecuniary damages. Suffering psychical burdens and men-
tal pain may be used as an argument to support the judgment116 or as a basis to es-

<p>tablish117 mental illness. The only exception was non-pecuniary damages for lost 
holiday experiences and recreation of working power. This was established by the 
Supreme Court118 some years before the ECJ&rsquo;s judgment in the Leitner case119. It is 
difficult to trace back the development of this specific doctrine in Hungarian law. 
One root for this could be the rejection of compensating non-pecuniary disadvan-
tages which prevailed until the amendment of the Civil Code in 1977. Another is 
the general difficulty all legal systems have to face in looking for the boundaries of 
compensable non-pecuniary losses. The amendment of the Civil Code in 1977 set 
these boundaries by requiring a significant or permanent personal injury or social 
disadvantage as a precondition for awarding non-pecuniary damages which also 
provided a definition of compensable non-pecuniary loss. The third one is the 
decision of the Hungarian Constitutional Court120 which eliminated this defini-
tion and the boundaries implied in that from the Civil Code 1959 but gave another 
one. The concept of non-pecuniary damages provided by the Constitutional Court 
has been built upon the perception that typical cases of non-pecuniary damages 
involve personal injury, health damage, interference with good reputation, viola-
tion of freedom of speech, etc, which are protected inherent rights of persons in 
the part of the Civil Code covering the law of persons. As the idea that, in the con-
text of non-pecuniary damages, compensable non-pecuniary loss, due to its im-
material nature, cannot be defined as damage did not allow a channelling of the 
definition of unlawfulness into the general doctrine that causing damage shall 
be deemed unlawful even if there is no explicit norm that has been violated, this 
concept also helped to adapt non-pecuniary damages to the structure of tort law. 
This new concept also provides the necessary limitations, implies a logical struc-
ture and was quickly accepted by both courts and theory121. From this follows that 
only detriments which could be described as interferences with protected inher-
ent rights of the person can be a basis for awarding non-pecuniary damages. In 
this logic, the court may award non-pecuniary damages for emotional distress, 
shock, pain, suffering, bad feelings, etc only if an inherent right of a person to live 
without distress, fear, pain, suffering, bad feelings, etc can be established. As such

<p>rights are still not recognised in Hungarian law ( they may ensue in the future ), 
such detriments may be compensated by non-pecuniary damages if they cause 
health damage ( mental illness ) as this involves a protected inherent right of per-
sons. The requirement of interference with inherent rights of persons became a 
general requirement for awarding non-pecuniary damages but court practice was 
inconsistent on the issue of whether an additional manifest disadvantage is a re-
quirement for awarding non-pecuniary damages or whether a wrongful interfer-
ence with protected inherent rights of the person per se establishes such a claim 
( as was suggested by the Constitutional Court in expressing its intention to pro-
vide complete protection of such rights ). One of the primary aims of the legislator 
in introducing indemnification as a replacement for non-pecuniary damages was 
to solve this problem and to make it clear that no additional manifest disadvan-
tage is required for awarding compensation for wrongful interference with inher-
ent rights of persons protected by the law.
</p>
<p>As the structure of protection of personality rights is based on a general 
clause and on open concepts, the courts may create personality rights, as for ex-
ample they did with the right to education122 in order to establish claims for non-
pecuniary damages where they think it fit or to reject the claim with reference to 
the absence of interference with inherent rights where they do not want to award 
non-pecuniary damages. In a case establishing that giving life to a healthy child 
may not be a ground for awarding non-pecuniary damages123 the Supreme Court 
avoided establishing its judgment upon moral assessment, arguments about the 
concept of damages or the moral value of birth and life and concluded that the 
plaintiff could not show that her personality rights had been interfered with. The 
right to family planning was referred to in the unificatory resolution of the Su-
preme Court covering wrongful life claims and the right to live in a complete fam-
ily is also the basis for awarding damages to relatives of direct victims of accidents 
and other interferences with personality rights124. In the course of awarding dam-
ages for loss of convenience and leisure time in the context of travel contracts, 
however, the court did not explain the decision as a violation of personality rights. 
Thus, there still seem to be some doctrinal inconsistencies in court practice.
</p>
<p>Although it has been argued that in the context of non-pecuniary damages the 
damage as a precondition for liability should be replaced by wrongful interference 
with the victim&rsquo;s personality rights and the aggrieved person should be entitled 
to claim non-pecuniary damages without proving any actual harm, costs or loss

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>in the traditional sense of these words125, this view is yet to be accepted in court 
practice. In order to award non-pecuniary damages as compensation for mere fear, 
this would postulate pre-qualifying fear as a wrongful interference with personal-
ity rights of the victim. Court practice, despite the fact that there are decisions 
of lower courts showing some inclination to move in this direction126, does not 
seem to accept such extension of the concept of personality rights or the concept 
of non-pecuniary loss. If fear results in a normally compensable loss, eg deprecia-
tion of the value of land ( eg because of alleged radiation from a working mobile 
phone transmission tower built on the neighbouring land )127 or in a psychiatric 
illness ( as non-pecuniary loss )128, this loss shall be compensated but mere fear in 
itself has not yet been accepted as a compensable loss in the practice of the Hun-
garian Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court seems to require proven detriment arising from the 
wrongful interference with the inherent rights of the person in order to award 
compensation for non-pecuniary loss. As, however, the apparent reasoning be-
hind this approach seems to be to exclude claims for compensating &raquo; bagatelle &laquo; 
harm, the importance of this conflict between theory and practice is not clear129. 
There were arguments in the course of the preparatory works of the Civil Code 
2013 to formulate a provision that excludes awarding the indemnity replacing non-
pecuniary damages for de minimis claims but this did not happen. In spite of this it 
seems that courts are reluctant to award non-pecuniary damages if the immaterial 
loss does not reach a minimum level or the interference with the inherent rights 
of the victim was insignificant.
</p>
<p>In Hungarian court practice and theory it has never been questioned that sep-
arate legal entities ( including companies ) may have inherent rights which can be 
interfered with and thus they may be entitled to receive non-pecuniary damages130. 
Legal entities are supposed to own rights that are not capable of belonging only to 
natural persons by virtue of their nature.
</p>
<p>Awarding damages for violation of values that cannot be expressed in money 
due to their non-transferable nature certainly implies the consequence that the 
law makes measurable in money what should not be measured with it. This was 
one of the reasons why, in the course of codification of the Civil Code 1959, the

<p>awarding of non-pecuniary damages was rejected. This tendency, however, seems 
to be an inherent necessity. If the law rejected awarding non-pecuniary damages 
as a consequence of interference with personality rights, the level of protection 
of these rights would certainly fall to a lower degree ( criminal law cannot provide 
proper protection against all members of society or players in the market, espe-
cially legal entities ) which is a socially unacceptable result. Unless the law pre-
vents persons from agreeing with others not to invoke the protection of their in-
herent rights, such a quantification in monetary terms is unavoidable131. It seems 
a necessary development in law that the protection of rights and legal interests 
results in commercialisation.
</p>
<p>Distinguishing between pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages seems to be 
difficult in cases where both pecuniary loss and interference with personality 
rights occurred. Before introducing non-pecuniary damages into the Hungarian 
Civil Code in 1977, it was thought that the occurrence of non-pecuniary loss should 
always be linked with or implied in pecuniary damage. Thus, courts should award 
compensation for non-pecuniary losses as a part of general damages.
</p>
<p>The concept of damage implies social evaluations and moral principles. It 
also may be a question of legitimacy if the courts or the legislator is the one de-
termining compensable losses. Whether giving birth to a child may be the ground 
for a claim for damages is one of the most sensitive issues in the field of tort law. If 
a child with a cognitive disability was born because the doctors negligently failed 
to provide correct information on the foetus&rsquo; condition and thus prevented the 
parents from deciding against giving life to the child, the parents are entitled to 
pecuniary as well as non-pecuniary damages ( wrongful birth ). This is a well-estab-
lished practice of the Hungarian Supreme Court as well as being in line with the 
trends of European jurisdictions132. There is, however, a strong line of arguments 
in legal theory expressing a firm basic moral evaluation for rejecting claims on the 
ground of childbirth133. As far as wrongful life cases are concerned, the Hungarian 
Supreme Court established that a child shall not be entitled to claim either pecu-
niary or non-pecuniary damages from the medical service provider for being born 
with genetic or teratological deviations on the ground that, during the pregnancy, 
his / her mother could not have decided for an abortion because of the incorrect 
information given by the medical service provider if an abortion would have been 
otherwise permitted in such a case. The unificatory solution is to be restricted to 
wrongful life cases, ie to cases where the genetic or teratological deviation is of a

<p>natural origin and developed independently of the activity of the medical service 
provider or its employees. Thus, claims for damages as compensation for prena-
tal injuries ( compensation for injury suffered as a result of the intervention of 
doctors during the pregnancy ) are not covered by the resolution. The solution 
precludes a claim bring brought by the child for wrongful life but does not affect 
the claims of parents. The demand for the passing of such a solution concerning 
damages for wrongful life arose because, although the Supreme Court followed a 
settled practice of accepting such claims134, this interpretation did not correspond 
with the practice of some of the high courts in Hungary, which also declared and 
published their interpretation rejecting such claims brought by the child135. Not 
only the tension created by diverging practices of high courts but also the obvious 
deviation from the trends presented by European legal systems136 led the Supreme 
Court to revise its practice in such cases. As a result, obviously influenced by court 
practice of other European jurisdictions and with the clear intention of harmonis-
ing Hungarian court practice with the trend toward rejecting such claims in most 
European jurisdictions, the Supreme Court decided to revise its former practice 
and to adopt a uniform practice of rejecting claims for damages for wrongful life. 
The decision was also supported by arguments referring to decisions of the Eu-
ropean Court of Human Rights as well as to constitutional aspects. The result of 
passing such a decision in Hungarian law is a laying down of the law covered by 
the decision with the effect of an authoritative interpretation which might, per-
haps should, have been given by the legislator too. The necessity for passing such 
a decision in Hungarian law supports the argument that such sensitive issues may 
and should be addressed by the legislator even if this does not seem to be com-
patible with the flexible system of tort law. The process of making law, in a dem-
ocratic society, designed to channel and harmonise different social values and 
interests &ndash; in such sensitive areas &ndash; seems to be a more appropriate and more le-
gitimate way of fixing such principles than court decisions.
</p>
<p>The concept of compensable damage has not been elaborated in Hungarian 
legal theory and courts do not apply or refer to different categories or concepts of 
damage. Consequential loss was a distinct category in former private law before 
World War II. The distinction between actual harm and consequential loss includ-
ing lost profit in that system was an important factor for limitation of liability. The 
tortfeasor was held liable for consequential loss and lost profit only if he had acted

<p>intentionally or he was grossly negligent. The relevance of this distinction, how-
ever, was abandoned in the Civil Code 1959 which did not retain these categories.
</p>
<p>There is a distinction between direct and indirect damage in Hungarian tort 
law literature that covers a problem of causation137. Secondary categorisations 
such as real damage and nominal damage, concrete and abstract, natural and nor-
mative or subjective and objective damage138 are not used in Hungarian tort law, 
either in court practice or in professional discussions. Such approaches, however, 
may be relevant to professional methods applied by judicial experts appointed by 
the courts in order to establish damage, which is basically held to be a specific 
professional issue to be established by experts much more than a question of law 
to be decided by the courts, except for the problem of compensability which is a 
question of law, eg in the case of loss in illicit gains. In contract law a distinction 
between primary and consequential damage with vague conceptual contours139 
has been applied in the context of remedies for defective performance but this ap-
proach has not been extended to tort law. The distinction between performance 
interest and reliance interests or positive and negative interests140 is also used in 
Hungarian tort law. Its development in Hungarian private law theory was also at-
tached to consequences of invalid contracts and very much influenced by the Ger-
man doctrine141. Today neither the real &ndash; contractual or delictual &ndash; nature nor the 
content of these categories are clear. In practice, the distinction between reliance 
and performance interests seems to be dissolved in the categories of actual profit 
and lost pecuniary advantage142.
</p>
<p>II.  Causation
</p>
<p>The consequence of establishing a causal link between compensable loss and 
wrongful conduct is liability. This necessarily involves causation being a legal con-
cept. Causation is a central element of liability. In spite of this, in Hungarian legal 
theory and court practice, causation is not one of the widely addressed problems. 
German legal literature always had a great impact on Hungarian legal thought and 
this might have been an important factor in the theory traditionally focusing on 
legal rather than natural causation and attempting to find a general model, de-

<p>scription or theory to describe causation143. These attempts did not produce use-
ful results. The main ground for the failure of these attempts could be that they 
tried to adapt the philosophical concept of causation into a legal context and in-
terpretation144. In socialist legal theory, the preventive function of liability came 
to the foreground of legal theory. The role of causation in risk allocation was also 
put into the context of prevention. The primary test of causation became whether 
the law could have a preventive impact on decisions of persons contributing to the 
causal link that resulted in damage.
</p>
<p>There was no rule in the Civil Code 1959 which could provide any normative 
prescription or framework for causation. The Civil Code 2013 does not provide de-
tailed regulation on causation either but provides two norms for assessing causa-
tion. In the context of multiple tortfeasors, the Civil Code 2013 provides that the 
provisions covering liability of multiple tortfeasors shall be applied accordingly if 
the damage might have been caused by any of several courses of conduct engaged 
in at the same time or if it cannot be established which conduct caused the dam-
age145. This rule is a normative implementation of the solution to the problem of 
alternative causation concerning natural causation. The other relevant rule ad-
dresses legal causation providing a foreseeability limit in tort law and provides 
that the causal link shall not be established in connection with losses which were 
not and could not have been foreseen by the tortfeasor146.
</p>
<p>Even in former private law, before World War II, causation in tort law was re-
garded as a complex problem, which could be considered only in the context of 
the other preconditions of liability: accountability and damage. Marton described 
causation as a logical connection between the harm and the cause. He criticised 
the traditional approach, which restricts the causation problem to the question of 
whether the conduct is a precondition for establishing liability and which tries to 
cover the imperfections of the traditional culpability doctrine with the modifica-
tions of the causation link through picking out relevant causes from the complex 
texture of natural causation147. He argued that there is no difference between legal 
and natural causation. According to Marton, legal causation is identical to natural 
causation and the concept ( or doctrine ) of liability should provide the answer to 
the question as to which point we should go back to in the causation link in order 
to establish liability148. E&ouml;rsi also considers causation in the context of wrongful-
ness and accountability, the two further elements of liability. According to E&ouml;rsi,

</p>
<p>except in cases where the conduct itself is wrongful without taking regard of its 
result, causation is involved in every composite element of liability, but causation 
itself is not an independent precondition for liability. Causation cannot be consid-
ered in its abstract form, it can only be considered in respect of the policy accord-
ing to which liability is established149.
</p>
<p>Causation is an element of the &raquo; flexible system &laquo; in tort law. It means that the 
court has to apply an evaluation method to choose the relevant cause ( s ) from the 
causal chain. The causal link must be established between the breach of duty ( not 
to cause harm ) and damage. It is not enough to consider the objective chain of 
events leading to the harm ( conditio sine qua non ) &ndash; the judge has to look for the 
relevant cause of the harm. It is a kind of adequate causality theory150.
</p>
<p>According to  Petrik,  the causal link between the harm and the tortfeasor&rsquo;s 
conduct is to be established if three concurrent preconditions are met: the harm 
could not have occurred without the tortfeasor&rsquo;s conduct; the conduct is attrib-
utable to the tortfeasor; and it is possible to influence the tortfeasor&rsquo;s conduct 
with the application of a legal sanction ( the legal sanction may have a preventive 
effect )151. This approach is based on E&ouml;rsi&rsquo;s theory and presents a strong connec-
tion between wrongfulness and causation. According to this view, if the law did 
not have a preventive effect on behaviour, it is not reasonable to look at whether 
such behaviour was a relevant cause of the loss. The question of wrongfulness, 
ie the search as to whether the conduct complied with the required standard of 
conduct, emerges only if establishing liability could influence the behaviour of 
similar persons in the same situation. This approach does not draw a clear line 
between wrongfulness and causation.
</p>
<p>Theory does not analyse the relationship between natural and legal causa-
tion but addresses causation as an element of liability. The but-for test, requir-
ing that, in order to establish liability, the harm could not have occurred without 
the tortfeasor&rsquo;s conduct, is a generally accepted starting point in establishing the 
causal link in both theory and practice. Neither do courts seem to attach great im-
portance or relevance to the distinction between natural and legal causation, al-
though it is also known in Hungarian legal literature152.
</p>
<p>Neither regulation nor practice distinguishes between direct and indirect cau-
sation and it is well established in theory and practice that an omission can be re-
garded as the cause of harm. A breach of duty is treated as a cause of the damage if 
the harm would not have occurred in the case of performance of the legal obliga-
tion. The wrongdoer will be liable for his omission if the damage would not have

<p>occurred if he had acted according to his duty, as imposed on him by law153. In the 
case of an omission, liability is established by not starting a causal process which 
would have prevented the harm. If the breach of the duty is not a natural cause of 
the harm, the causal link is not to be established. If, for instance, a doctor is called 
or arrives too late to a seriously injured person but it is proven that the injured per-
son would also have died if the doctor had been present earlier, the omission is 
not a cause of the harm, so liability cannot be established on the basis of a breach 
of duty154. The same holds for cases where a physician omits his duty to inform the 
patient about the possible risks and side effects of medical treatment or interven-
tion. If the patient would have consented even if he had been correctly informed 
and would not have decided otherwise, the court will reject the claim for damages 
for breaching the duty to inform on the ground of lack of causation155. The omis-
sion can also be a relevant cause of the harm if there is a legal duty to act, the tort-
feasor breaches this requirement by not acting and, if in the case of acting, that 
harm would not have occurred. In this case all of these requirements are fulfilled.
</p>
<p>The Civil Code 1959 provided a special rule for damage caused by multiple tort-
feasors. According to Civil Code 1959, &sect; 344, if the damage was caused jointly by 
two or more persons, their liability vis-&agrave;-vis the victim was joint and several. Their 
liability towards one another was divided in proportion to their respective degree 
of responsibility. Liability for damages was divided in equal proportions among 
the responsible persons if the degree of their responsibility could not be estab-
lished. The court was entitled to declare joint and several liability and hold the 
persons having caused the damage liable in proportion to their respective con-
tributions if doing so would not jeopardise or considerably delay the compensa-
tion of the damage or if the aggrieved person had himself contributed to the oc-
currence of the damage or had procrastinated in enforcing his claim without any 
excusable reason156. In the literature and in practice there is controversy about

156 The Civil Code 2013, &sect; 6: 524, maintains the same system. If two or more persons caused dam-

in proportion to the extent of their contribution. If the proportion of contribution cannot be

sors in proportion to the extent of their contribution. If even the proportion of contribution

<p>whether two or more persons should act with a certain degree of common in-
tention or whether they can act independently to be held jointly and severally li-
able for the damage. In the literature there are opinions according to which com-
mon intent is a necessary requirement for establishing joint and several liability157. 
This view is, however, not in accordance with the policy underlying the Civil Code 
2013 which explicitly states that common intention of several tortfeasors is not 
a precondition for treating them as joint or multiple tortfeasors. More authen-
tic interpretations also stress the objective character of the assessment and that 
common intent is not a precondition for joint liability; the object of the tortfea-
sors&rsquo; conduct is irrelevant. If, for instance, two cars collide and as a result of the 
accident someone who is sitting in one of the cars is injured, the two car drivers 
shall be treated as multiple tortfeasors and are jointly and severally liable158. Mere 
interdependence in causation is, however, not always enough to establish joint li-
ability. If someone negligently fails to fulfil his obligation and this makes it pos-
sible for someone else to cause harm, he / she shall also be jointly and severally li-
able with the tortfeasor who caused the harm directly. The two main principles for 
rendering joint and several liability are prevention and the provision of a better 
chance of compensation for the claimant. The distinction between &ndash; jointly and 
severally liable &ndash; multiple tortfeasors and several independently liable tortfeasors 
can be found in terms of causation: the tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable 
multiple tortfeasors if the behaviour of each is a conditio sine qua non but the tort-
feasors shall not be jointly and severally liable if there is no causal interdepend-
ence between the harmful conduct or if the interdependency is too remote. If, for 
instance, someone causes a car accident and the injured person suffers an injury 
which is not fatal but dies because the surgeon is negligent, the two tortfeasors 
are not jointly and severally liable159. Thus, joint and several liability is to be es-
tablished if each of the tortfeasors&rsquo; conduct was a conditio sine qua non for the 
whole and same loss. This statement is to be amended to the effect that joint and 
several liability is also to be established if the damage might have been caused by 
any one of the several courses of conduct engaged in at the same time, or if it can-
not be established, which conduct caused the damage160. This means that, in the 
context of multiple tortfeasor scenarios, the contribution to creating the risk can 
result in establishing the causal link. As far as multiple tortfeasor scenarios and 
establishing joint and several liability are concerned, tort law focuses on causa-
</p>
<p>any one of the several courses of conduct engaged in at the same time, or it cannot be estab-
lished, which conduct caused the damage.

<p>tion, where the damage integrates the chain of events and conduct contributing 
to the loss into a &raquo; common &laquo; causal link and not on the intention of the tortfea-
sors. Whether the tortfeasors actually influenced each others&rsquo; conscious, intent 
or behaviour is not relevant. If, for example, several persons agree to embark on a 
crime and one of them argues that the others would have committed it even if he 
had not joined them, this plea is not considered even if it were actually true. That 
is why psychological causation is not considered in such cases at all161. It is also 
irrelevant whether the tortfeasors knew about the acts of each other. Common 
causation can also be established if the bases of liability are different. For exam-
ple, if someone causes an accident by driving a car because he was negligent in 
complying with the rules of traffic, the owner of the car as the operator of the car 
is liable under the strict regime of liability for extra-hazardous activities162, while 
the driver is liable according to the normal fault-based liability regime, but they 
will be held to be multiple tortfeasors being joint and severally liable vis-&agrave;-vis the 
victims of the accident.
</p>
<p>In the course of establishing that the defendant contributed to the causal link 
resulting in the loss, the burden of proof of the causal link between the defend-
ant&rsquo;s conduct and the injury suffered rests on the victim. If the victim could have 
been hurt either by a person&rsquo;s actions or by a hazard and the claimant cannot 
prove that the person caused the victim&rsquo;s injury or death, his claim shall be re-
jected. The courts in certain cases may solve the problem by establishing joint 
and several liability, but only where the danger was an indirect cause of the injury 
or death, ie the but-for test can be satisfied relating to the danger. The burden 
of proof is regarded very strictly by Hungarian courts. If the cause of the harm is 
unknown, the claimant cannot establish liability of the defendant on the ground 
of general rules of liability. For this reason this problem is neither addressed in 
the literature nor arises in court practice. If it is proven that a certain physical or 
psychological condition of the victim determined his injury but a certain event 
worsened this condition and therefore accelerated the occurrence of damage, the 
liability for this event can be established163.
</p>
<p>161 In a case where three persons stole a car, one of them was taken home, then the other two thieves 
drove further and after a while suffered an accident in which the car was damaged, the liability of

</p>
<p>According to theory and practice, the multiplicity of tortfeasors shall be estab-
lished also by successive events: the thief and receiver of stolen goods are multiple 
or common tortfeasors and are jointly and severally liable even if they did not act 
together and the receiver was not an accessory to the theft164. From the structure 
of thinking regarding common causation and multiple tortfeasors, it follows that 
the plea of the receiver that the thief would have given the stolen goods to another 
if he had not taken them would not be accepted even if this was actually the case. 
E&ouml;rsi tries to explain the multiplicity of tortfeasors with the following example. D 
causes an injury to P who needs hospital treatment because of the injury. If P dies 
in the hospital, the direct cause of his death will determine whether D shall be 
proportionally or jointly and severally liable with the hospital. If P dies as a result 
of a fire which broke out in the hospital, the two causes ( injury and fire ) are inde-
pendent, so there is no common causation and D and the hospital are not multi-
ple tortfeasors: both of them shall be liable for the harm they respectively caused. 
If P dies in the hospital as a result of malpractice in the course of hospital treat-
ment, D and the hospital are multiple tortfeasors and jointly and severally liable 
because the accident is a relevant cause of the death of the victim. If P dies in the 
hospital as a result of an infection in the hospital or in the city, the multiplicity 
depends on whether the injury increased the chance of being infected. If the an-
swer is yes ( eg because the injury weakened P&rsquo;s immune system ), then D and the 
hospital are multiple tortfeasors and jointly and severally liable165.
</p>
<p>There are cases where it can be established that the defendant took part in 
a chain of events resulting in damage but it is impossible to ascertain whether 
the loss could also have occurred in the absence of his conduct. In such cases, as 
the burden of proof is allocated to the victim, the impossibility of proving who 
caused the harm and the damage would result in no compensation. This need 
for proof or Beweisnotstand would have left the damage uncompensated in cases 
where the damage and fault are obvious and the narrow circle of possible tortfea-
sors is known. The principle of prevention could also be undermined by rejecting 
the claim in these cases. On the other hand, relieving the victim of the burden 
of proving the causal link in such cases could not only undermine the structure 
of tort law but it also involves the risk of declaring someone liable without legal 
ground, thus leading to unjust results.
</p>
<p>Courts, trying to adhere to the structure and the conceptual framework of tort 
law, have found different solutions to this problem. The first is that they estab-
lish partial causation if the defendant contributed to the plaintiff&rsquo;s damage but 
was not the sole cause of the loss. It has been established that in such cases the 
defendant cannot be held liable for the whole damage as there were other con-

<p>tributing causes resulting in the victim&rsquo;s losses. The defendant cannot be held li-
able for the part caused by external factors ( like weather, natural forces, etc ) or by 
other tortfeasors. Thus, the tortfeasor shall be liable ( only ) according to the ratio 
he contributed to the causal link resulting in the relevant compensable loss. Al-
though the courts consequently avoid considering or even speaking of probabil-
ity, this doctrine, in its result, seems to imply that in certain cases increasing the 
probability of occurrence of damage may establish a causal link as a contributing 
cause and the liability of the tortfeasor will be limited to the ratio he contributed 
to the loss166. The argumentation of the courts refers to partial causation but the 
decisions may actually imply divisibility of damage. The divisibility of damage is 
not considered in the available judgments in this context but can be seen as a pre-
condition for establishing liability for only part of the loss.
</p>
<p>The second is that they apply rules governing the liability of multiple tortfea-
sors. If it can be established that the defendant participated in an activity result-
ing in damage, his liability can be established as liability of one of the multiple 
tortfeasors. In such cases the court does not address the issue of whether the de-
fendant&rsquo;s conduct was a conditio sine qua non for the incurred loss insofar as it 
is irrelevant whether it was the defendant who actually performed the damaging 
conduct or if the other tortfeasors ( one of them performed the actual damaging 
conduct ) would have participated in the activity if the defendant had not done so. 
Courts presumably try to solve the problem of when there were more persons in-
volved in the conduct resulting in damage but only one or some of them could be 
the actual tortfeasor ( s ) and the victim does not have enough information to iden-
tify such, so that, due to the burden of proof shifting to her, the result is a rejection 
of the claim. The logical basis for this approach may be that the risk was created 
by several persons, among them the defendant. This approach shifts establishing 
the causal link between the conduct and damage to a causal link between creat-
ing a risk and the occurrence of damage. The procedural logic behind this is that 
multiple tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for the whole of the damage 
but it is not necessary for all of them to be involved in the civil procedure. Thus, 
if only one of the tortfeasors who takes part in the activity creating the risk result-
ing in the loss or contributing to the chain of events making the emergence of 
loss possible is party to the procedure as a defendant, the liability of this person 
can be established for the whole damage. The fact that the loss may actually have 
been caused by one or more other multiple tortfeasors who are not necessarily the 
defendant is irrelevant. This is important only concerning the issue of distribut-
ing the liability between the tortfeasors but not in establishing the defendant&rsquo;s 
liability towards the victim167. These solutions would open the way for accepting

<p>a new concept of causation, although in a limited way. According to this concept, 
increasing the probability of occurrence of loss could establish a ( natural ) causal 
link. Such an approach, also suggested in the literature of economic analysis of 
law, could provide an appropriate solution for the deficiencies of the but-for test 
( which also prevails in Hungarian tort law ) and a correct basis for establishing 
market share liability, causation in the &raquo; hunter &laquo; scenario or establishing liability 
if the conduct increased the probability of occurrence of damage but it is impos-
sible to know if the victim suffered the damage due to this increased risk or would 
also have suffered it otherwise168. Such a new approach to causation could solve 
the problems that theory and practice have to face concerning natural causation 
but neither in theory nor in practice has such a new concept been described. Ar-
gumentations of the courts in judgments are, in general, not clear in this respect. 
There is a kind of flexibility which is discernible and which shows that courts do 
not insist on following the conditio sine qua non principle if they realise that this 
would result in rejecting a legitimate claim against a defendant who contributed 
to creating the chance of occurrence of loss although such might not have contrib-
uted to the occurrence of loss.
</p>
<p>There is a new tendency in court practice toward reversing the burden of proof 
concerning the causal link. Courts in Hungary seem to find that in some cases a 
rigid application of the but-for test and the rule concerning the burden of proof 
regarding the causal link may result in a socially unjust and, as such, improper 
risk allocation and they try to find ways to correct this result, especially in cases 
of information asymmetry where the victim, due to his position, cannot provide 
the necessary information in order to give evidence while the risk of absence of 
information can reasonably be shifted to the defendant. The typical field where 
this development is to be seen is provided by medical malpractice. In the past few 
years, a clear tendency can be identified towards shifting the risk of uncertainty in 
causation to medical health care providers in medical malpractice cases. In this 
group of cases, the courts seem to accept that the burden of proof resting on the 
victim concerning a causal link is discharged even if there are unclear, unrevealed 
facts of the case such as the unknown origin of injuries or illnesses. In some cases 
courts reverse the burden of proof of the causal link by requiring the proof of an 
absence of a causal link from the defendant medical service provider in a matter 
where the defendant&rsquo;s doctors failed to comply with the required duty of care in 
the context of unclear facts of the case169. This tendency to shift the risk of uncer-

<p>tain causation to the medical service provider or other potential tortfeasor seems 
to be clear in personal injury or medical malpractice cases but still has not been 
confirmed as a general rule. Although at the level of arguments this is expressed 
so as to accept that changes in chances may establish a causal link and increas-
ing the risk of occurrence of damage can establish a causal link and the liability of 
medical health care service providers, the doctrine of loss of chance has not been 
recognised in Hungarian tort law, either as a head of compensable loss or as be-
ing sufficient to establish a causal link. As a result of a recent development in the 
context of liability for medical malpractice and liability for non-pecuniary dam-
age, court practice seems to accept that increasing the risk of loss may establish 
liability. In a decision reported in 2006, the Supreme Court established the liabil-
ity of doctors on the basis of an error in a diagnosis that resulted in an increased 
risk of giving birth to children with cognitive disabilities and awarded pecuniary 
and non-pecuniary damages to the children and their parents170. This tendency 
was confirmed in another decision of the Supreme Court171 awarding damages on 
the basis that the doctors, in the course of treatment of a newborn child, failed to 
reduce the risk of meningitis and its consequences, although they should have 
recognised the risk to which the child was exposed172. In a recent judgment173 the 
Supreme Court clearly formulated that losing a chance of recovery may establish a 
causal link between the death of the patient and the loss of the plaintiff. Although 
such cases have been presented and reported as loss of a chance cases, neither 
inherent uncertainties were involved nor were probabilities considered. What the 
courts actually did was establish a reversed burden of proof of causation on the 
basis of the negligence of the defendant&rsquo;s doctors. In the judgments the courts al-
located the risk of uncertainty and assigned it to the defendant. Such reversal of 
the burden of proof has occurred in other cases as well. In a recent judgment con-
cerning the liability of a motorway operator174, the Supreme Court required the 
operator to prove either that the fence was not defective at the time of the accident 
at all or that game could not get onto the highway due to a defect of the fence in 
order to be relieved of liability for damage that was caused by game gaining access 
to the road.
</p>
<p>These tendencies, however, have not yet been extended to cases other than 
personal injury and medical malpractice. The doctrine of loss of a chance has not 
been recognised as a prevailing doctrine. Probabilities are not calculated in such 
cases and in other fields of professional liability ( eg liability of lawyers ) courts

<p>are reluctant to accept such an approach. It may also be an important limitation 
of this new development that, in cases where courts accepted the reduced chance 
of recovery as a causal link, non-pecuniary damages have been awarded. Thus, 
courts did not have to face the problem of calculating damage or partial compen-
sation and, on the other hand, the highest protected interest was interfered with. 
There are no indications that such approaches will be extended to claims where 
rights or interests protected on a lower level are involved or to claims for pecuni-
ary damages.
</p>
<p>It seems that court practice does not attempt to solve the problems of natural 
causation on doctrinal bases ( loss of a chance, market share liability ) but tries to 
work out solutions such as shifting the burden of proof, establishing partial cau-
sation, and accepting changes of probability as a causal link in the context of non-
pecuniary damages in medical malpractice cases.
</p>
<p>Causation has been addressed in legal theory much more as an element of 
limiting liability than as of establishing liability. More focus has been placed on 
under what circumstances liability should not be established in spite of the fact 
that the but-for test is complied with rather than how causation works in the con-
text of tort law as a body of law attempting to provide an optimal level of preven-
tion and a balance between deterrence and self-reliance.

<p> Part 6 The elements of liability
</p>
<p>I.  Wrongfulness
</p>
<p>In Hungarian tort law, unlawfulness is a concept which is deemed a structurally 
and theoretically independent element of liability distinct from fault. As a general 
principle in Hungarian legal theory, conduct which results in damage to others 
is unlawful and from this it follows that causing harm is always unlawful175. The 
theoretical basis for the concept of unlawfulness is that causing damage shall be 
deemed unlawful unless it is explicitly otherwise provided by law. If the tortfea-
sor can prove that, in the particular case, causing harm was explicitly provided 
to be lawful by law, he shall not be liable176. The basic idea behind this approach 
was that if the generally accepted requirements of social behaviour were violated, 
it should not be necessary to find a specific norm the tortfeasor failed to comply 
with in order to establish liability for behaviour that resulted in loss to others or 
to establish that legally protected interests were interfered with. Court practice, 
however, has never been consistent in following this approach. Courts very often 
try to find a certain legal norm which has been infringed by the tortfeasor in or-
der to establish liability even if this would not be a necessary requirement. This 
approach of the courts has often been criticised as being incorrect and inconsist-
ent with the underlying concept of unlawfulness. On the other hand, the current 
theory oversimplifies the original idea which implicitly requires behaviour which 
does not comply with generally accepted values in society. This original idea never 
meant that causing damage was unlawful per se. Unlawfulness as a necessary pre-
condition of liability should be treated as a complex category such as fault or cau-
sation. Court practice, which already does so177, is not incorrect but is evidence of 
the untenability of the original over-simplifying theory. This complex approach 
of keeping the concept of unlawfulness as flexible as fault and causation would 
fit the flexible system of tort law and would allow the courts greater discretion in 
risk allocation and risk spreading. It has become clear that the original theoretical 
concept of unlawfulness mentioned above should be revised.

</p>
<p>The Hungarian legislator, however, failed to consider that not only are unlaw-
fulness and fault interrelating and overlapping elements of liability but that hold-
ing them separate is also burdened by a contradiction: if behaviour was unlawful, 
why should it not be sanctioned due to absence of fault and vice versa ? How is it 
possible that behaviour which does not comply with the required standard of con-
duct may be held lawful ? Instead of reconsidering unlawfulness and fault and at-
tempting to provide a proper concept involving both of them ( wrongfulness ), the 
legislator in the Civil Code 2013 reinforced the independent nature of the concept 
of unlawfulness, and provided a specified test for it which may eliminate the struc-
tural contradiction in the system. According to this rule, all wrongdoing resulting 
in damage shall be deemed unlawful, except if: a ) it was caused with the victim&rsquo;s 
consent; b ) it was caused to an aggressor in the course of warding off an unlawful 
attack or the threat of an imminent unlawful attack insofar as such conduct did 
not exceed what was necessary to ward off the attack; c ) it was caused in necessity, 
insofar as it was proportionate; or d ) it was conduct permitted by the law and the 
conduct did not interfere with legally protected interests of another person or the 
law otherwise provides for paying compensation to the aggrieved person178.
</p>
<p>Thus, within this structure it shall be questioned first whether the behaviour 
resulting in damage was lawful or not. If the law does not provide that causing 
damage under the given facts of the case is lawful, it is to be deemed unlawful. 
If that is the case, it shall be questioned whether the tortfeasor&rsquo;s act complied 
with the required standard of conduct ( the absence of which establishes fault ) or 
if there are other circumstances relieving him of liability. If so, he shall be exoner-
ated from liability. This is a general test of unlawfulness. It seems that, in the con-
text of unlawfulness, Hungarian tort law follows a result-based approach. This is 
strengthened by the concept of fault which is also considered an objective concept.
</p>
<p>The sensitive issue of liability of persons taking part in a juridical procedure 
as a witness or expert has not been exposed so far in Hungarian tort law. It seems, 
however, that, in giving priority to the public interest attached to access to jus-
tice, courts provide some kind of immunity to such participants of juridical pro-
cedures. The practice of criminal courts explicitly establishes such immunity for 
parties and witnesses if they made statements in the course of a procedure that 
could otherwise be qualified as an interference with good reputation and human 
dignity179. Also, even in the absence of a doctrine such as &raquo; expert witness immu-
nity &laquo;, courts are reluctant to accept claims for damages against judicial experts on 
the basis of their opinion provided in the court procedure180. In such cases courts

<p>do not hold the conduct of the defendant who made the statements or gave the 
opinion as a party, witness, expert or other participant to another procedure un-
lawful.
</p>
<p>There is no form of de minimis rule accepted, either in theory or in practice, 
although, in the context of non-pecuniary damages, courts are reluctant to award 
non-pecuniary damages if there is no apparent violation of a legally protected in-
terest.
</p>
<p>The required duty of care is set by a general clause as a general requirement, 
in the sense of a standard of conduct that persons are required to follow in the 
course of exercising their rights and performing their obligations in private law 
relationships. This rule is provided as an overall principle as part of the introduc-
tory provisions of the Civil Code 1959 as well as of the Civil Code 2013. The required 
duty of care is conduct that is generally expected under the given circumstances of 
the case181. As non-compliance with the required standard of conduct is defined by 
the same rule, this is an element of fault. Using the same rule as the basis of fault 
and unlawfulness, this element of liability breaks with the internal logic of mak-
ing a distinction between unlawfulness and fault and creates internal inconsist-
ency182. According to this type of regulation, the proper view would regard wrong-
fulness as a concept covering both unlawfulness and fault. There is no specific 
rule or doctrine, either on the level of legislation or in court practice or theory for 
omissions. Thus, if there was a duty to act under the given circumstances of the 
case, such shall also be assessed under this general clause. The underlying idea 
behind this is that in most cases it is impossible or senseless to make a distinc-
tion between act and omission, as mostly they can be described interchangeably 
( eg if a car driver drives too fast, it is an act &ndash; he exceeds the speed limit but, at the 
same time, an omission as he fails to comply with the statutory requirements on 
the maximum speed limit ). The central question is always the compliance or non-
compliance with the required standards of society.
</p>
<p>Although understanding the response of courts to claims covering the pro-
tection of pure economic interests lies at the heart of tort law, there is no specific 
doctrine in Hungary that covers pure economic loss. Pure economic loss as an 
independent category of damage or description of certain protected interests is 
not known in the Hungarian legal system. The main conceptual feature of pure 
economic loss is that it is a loss without antecedent harm to the plaintiff&rsquo;s person 
or property, which is not consequential loss in the same patrimony in which prop-
erty has been damaged and which is not the loss of the plaintiff who, as a person,

<p>has been injured183. Pure economic loss is &raquo; harm not causally consequent upon an 
injury to the person ( life, body, health, freedom or other rights to personality ) or 
to property ( tangible or intangible assets ) &laquo;184. Hungarian case law is poor in this 
area of tort law. One reason for this is that for a long time the concept of economic 
loss itself had been incompatible with the socialist social and economic approach, 
which did not respect profit and the chance of gains. A further consideration re-
lates to the fact that courts normally apply the flexible system of tort law without 
explicitly referring to it. The problem of pure economic loss is the problem of 
limitation of liability and mostly it is a problem of legal causation in case law and 
legal theory.
</p>
<p>The Hungarian Supreme Court, in a case where a sales representative suffered 
a car accident which was caused negligently by another car driver and the con-
cluding of the contract between the sales representative&rsquo;s employer and another 
party failed because the accident prevented the sales representative from com-
ing to the place of contracting, held that the unrealised net income, which the 
employer would have earned from the performance of the contract if contracting 
had not been frustrated by the accident, is a compensable economic loss to the 
employer. The driver who caused the accident in which the sales representative 
was involved caused this economic loss. On this ground, the court held the driver 
liable for the economic loss of the employer and ordered the defendant ( the in-
surer of the driver who caused the accident ) to pay the lost net income as com-
pensation to the plaintiff185. It is remarkable that the defendant in this case was 
the tortfeasor&rsquo;s liability insurer and there seems to be a tendency in court prac-
tice that courts are more willing to order compensation if the risk is shifted to an 
insurance company. There are no further decisions relating to other typical cases 
of pure economic loss ( further cases of ricochet loss, transferred loss, closures of 
public markets, transportation corridors and public infrastructures or cases of 
reliance upon flawed data, advice or professional services ) which could have re-
inforced the standpoint of the courts in this case. Due to the specific facts of this 
case and the absence of a general conceptual approach, it is impossible to predict 
whether this decision may be the starting point for a tendency in this direction or 
was just a one-off case.
</p>
<p>It seems that a great bulk of the typical pure economic loss cases are treated 
in Hungarian tort law theory and practice as part of the problems of causation and 
they find their place under the heading &raquo; indirect losses or indirect causation &laquo;. The 
problems of indirect causation are coming into the foreground nowadays in pro-

<p>fessional debates. The model case for this problem is that a company ( as primary 
victim ) suffers loss and &ndash; as the result of this loss &ndash; the value of the company&rsquo;s 
shares owned by the members of the company ( as secondary victims ) also falls. 
The question is whether the members of the company ( the owners of the shares ) 
may bring a successful action in tort against the tortfeasor, seeking compensa-
tion for the depreciation of their shares. The general and commonly shared view 
among legal practitioners ( including lawyers and judges ) and scholars is that such 
a claim by the members of the company should be dismissed and these kinds of 
losses should not be compensated although a clear theoretical answer to the ques-
tion could hardly be found. It seems that in the flexible system of tort law, the solu-
tion to this problem is also to be found primarily in causation. The partial answer 
of the Supreme Court to this problem is that the claim of the company against the 
tortfeasor should be decided first in order to assess the loss of the shareholders. 
Enforcement of the claim of the company is a necessary precondition of the pos-
sibility of the claim of the shareholder. Insofar as the company did not enforce the 
claim or if the claim of the company was rejected, the shareholders cannot have 
an established claim either186.
</p>
<p>The basic rule of liability providing the concept of fault lies at the heart of 
Hungarian tort law regulation. According to this rule, if someone causes harm 
unlawfully to another person, the tortfeasor shall pay damages unless he proves 
that he acted as was generally expected under the given circumstances of the case. 
With the special standard of &raquo; generally expected behaviour under the given cir-
cumstances &laquo;, the Civil Code 1959 as well as the Civil Code 2013 have been enacted 
under the influence of the theory of fault-based liability with a special objectivised 
standard putting the basis of accountability somewhere between subjective and 
objective liability.
</p>
<p>The burden of proof regarding damage and the causal link between the tort-
feasor&rsquo;s conduct and damage as preconditions of liability is allocated to the plain-
tiff. The burden of proof as regards compliance with the generally required stand-
ard of conduct ( &raquo; generally expected behaviour under the given circumstances &laquo; ), ie 
absence of fault, is allocated to the tortfeasor. In Hungarian tort law, unlawfulness 
of behaviour is defined as causing damage. Thus, it is the measure of lawfulness 
of the behaviour which determines whether causing damage was permitted under 
the given circumstances or not. The unlawfulness of causing damage is presumed 
and also the tortfeasor has to prove that, in the given situation, causing damage 
was permitted by law in order to exempt himself from liability. The basic norm of 
liability provides the general rule and there are specific forms of liability for dif-
ferent situations, which make the divergence from the general rule necessary or

</p>
<p>where establishing liability is necessary but would not follow from the general 
norm. The basic idea behind this structure is twofold. First, there are cases where 
liability is imposed on a person who may not be the actual tortfeasor ( he himself 
did not engage in conduct resulting in damage ). Second, different measures or 
preconditions are to be applied for the person otherwise liable to be relieved of li-
ability, ie fault is replaced with stricter prerequisites ( eg unavoidable cause falling 
outside the scope of activity ).
</p>
<p>II.  Fault
</p>
<p>Although the concept of fault has traditionally been at the core of tort law ( in con-
trast to damage ) in Hungarian theory, emphasising the function of influencing 
the behaviour of members of society in order to prevent wrongdoing, there are no 
general guidelines or doctrines ( eg as was suggested by the Hand-rule formulated 
by the American judge, Learned Hand, and supported in the economic analysis of 
law literature as well ). As has been explained in tort law theory, if prevention is the 
primary function of tort law, only conduct that can be influenced by law may be 
relevant in the course of establishing liability. Thus, conduct that is attributable 
to the person whose liability is at stake can reasonably be held as establishing li-
ability for damages. To define and to establish whether and under what precondi-
tions or circumstances conduct can be attributable to the defendant is a question 
of putting the social evaluation of the conduct somewhere on a scale. The weakest 
point of the scale is subjective liability, where liability is established according to 
the content of the conscious state of the tortfeasor&rsquo;s mind ( this is the point of view 
of criminal liability ), while the strongest point is absolutely strict liability where 
there is no exoneration of the person whose liability is at stake.
</p>
<p>An important peculiarity of Hungarian tort law is that it involves fault-based 
liability with a reversed burden of proof. This means that if the victim has proved 
the damage and the causal link between the damage and the unlawful behaviour 
of the tortfeasor, it is the tortfeasor who has to prove the absence of fault in order 
to be relieved of liability. In Hungarian tort law the basic norm requiring fault as 
a prerequisite for liability puts the valuation on the scale somewhere between the 
weakest and the strictest point. The conscious state of mind or the personal skills, 
knowledge, etc of the tortfeasor are, unlike in criminal liability, irrelevant from the 
point of view of establishing fault. The tortfeasor cannot be exempted from liabil-
ity on the basis that he used all his best efforts in order to avoid ( not to cause ) the 
loss. He has to prove that his conduct complied with the required standard of con-
duct under the given circumstances of the case in order to be relieved of liability. 
The generally required conduct is an objectivised measure expressing what the de-

</p>
<p>fendant should have done under the circumstances of the case. Thus, will, inten-
tion or other subjective criteria are not relevant in the course of establishing fault. 
Establishing fault involves an objective assessment of the defendant&rsquo;s conduct in 
the given situation in the light of social evaluation. Specific forms of liability, such 
as liability for extra-hazardous activities, liability for animals, vicarious liability, 
product liability, environmental liability, liability for nuclear damage, etc shift the 
assessment to the stricter end of the scale in different degrees by specifying the 
prerequisites for exoneration for the person on whom liability is to be imposed.
</p>
<p>By definition tort law concerns liability for the violation of duties imposed on 
persons by law and not by contract. If an obligation is contractual, the sanction for 
violating it involves liability for breach of contract and not liability in tort. There is 
a strict and consistent division between delictual ( in tort ) and contractual liability, 
in the theory and structure of civil law. This, however, does not necessarily mean 
that such a distinction is reflected on the level of regulation too. Moreover, if one 
explains liability as a civil law sanction for violating a civil law obligation, keep-
ing them together and providing common regulations for them seems to be a pal-
pable approach. The question is, however, whether the difference arises from the 
contractual or non-contractual nature of the infringed obligation, ie whether the 
basis of liability is a violation of a voluntary promise or a legal norm ( a general ob-
ligation to prevent harm or a general prohibition from causing harm to others in 
society ), and whether the inevitable differences in the underlying policies justify 
and call for different regulations or not.
</p>
<p>One obvious and significant difference between liability in tort and liability 
for breach of contract has, however, been clearly developed in court practice and 
this is the different measure for exculpation: in contractual cases courts apply 
stricter tests in assessing whether the tortfeasor acted as was generally expected in 
the given situation and allow exculpation only if the defendant can prove that the 
harm in the given circumstances was unavoidable. Thus, the level of the required 
standard of conduct in contractual liability is higher than that in tort cases187. This 
tendency, and the obvious difference between the relationship of the parties in 
contractual and non-contractual cases, involving the need for different limitation 
measures too ( such as the foreseeability doctrine for liability for breach of con-
tract ), has led the Hungarian legislator to the conviction that the unified system 
should be replaced by a division between contractual and non-contractual liabil-
ity, even if they would basically remain congruent with respect to the measure of 
damages. The regulation on calculation of damages and the means of compensa-
tion itself &ndash; apart from the foreseeability limit for damages for breach of contract &ndash; 
is the same for liability for torts and for breach of contract in the Civil Code 2013.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>As a result, while maintaining the concept of fault for liability in tort, the 
Civil Code 2013 has introduced &ndash; in line with the developments in court practice &ndash; 
a strict liability regime for liability for breach of contract. The contracting party 
shall be relieved of liability only by proving that the circumstances causing the 
breach of contract fell outside his control, were not foreseeable at the time of con-
cluding the contract and he could not have been expected to avoid these circum-
stances or to prevent the loss188. This general rule in contractual liability was de-
signed according to the needs of commercial transactions, especially for the sale 
of goods. Its application will presumably lead to many problems in long-term re-
lationships, fiduciary relationships and in cases of professional liability such as 
the liability of doctors or lawyers. Court practice189 today applies strict liability 
regimes for business contracts but not for the liability of doctors and lawyers, al-
though they are also in contractual relationships with their clients. It is difficult to 
assess how the strict regime of contractual liability will work within these relation-
ships and this is also true of the foreseeability limit.
</p>
<p>The general rule of liability and the concept of fault based on the required 
duty of care, expressing the objective evaluation of the tortfeasor&rsquo;s conduct un-
der the given circumstances of the case and the social evaluation attached to it, 
are flexible enough to cover cases of professional negligence as well. There is no 
special doctrine, assessment or approach to be applied to cases on the liability of 
experts or professionals. The liability of directors of companies is also covered by 
this general rule, along with the liability of lawyers, doctors, etc. It is far from clear 
whether courts consider specific circumstances or use specific evaluation meth-
ods in such cases. There is still poorly reported case law, where the courts restrict 
themselves to establishing only obvious guidelines. What role market practices 
play in establishing the duties and liabilities of professionals is not clear from 
relevant case law. In other areas of professional liability ( especially in medical 
malpractice cases ), courts tend to regard best practices or settled protocols and 
requirements as the part of the required standard of conduct which are to be fol-
lowed by professionals but they cannot be relieved of liability solely by referring 
to the fact that they complied with them. Thus, courts may require and establish 
stricter or further standards for the given scenario.
</p>
<p>Especially in medical malpractice cases, courts seem to be shifting liability 
towards a strict liability regime, not only by applying the rules on providing strict 
liability for extra-hazardous activities in certain cases but also by reversing the 
burden of proof of causation, regarding the absence of proper documentation 
as a kind of presumption of negligence of doctors and moreover allowing exon-
eration in very few cases. One of the key factors in establishing fault in medical

</p>
<p>malpractice cases is the role of protocols. It has never been clear in court practice 
whether, if the defendant doctor or medical health care provider proved that they 
had complied with the relevant professional protocols, this would necessarily 
indicate compliance with the required duty of care in general, thereby resulting 
in an absence of fault and thus exoneration from liability. There are decisions 
declaring that compliance with the professional protocol results in compliance 
with the required duty of care and thus, an absence of fault190, and there are 
also decisions establishing that the absence of a violation of professional rules, 
standards and guidelines does not preclude establishing fault191. Compliance 
with professional standards and protocols in itself does not prevent the court 
from establishing the fault of the tortfeasor and consequently, the liability of 
the doctor or hospital192. Professional standards and protocols may be issued by 
the Ministry of Health, professional associations or implied as common general 
professional knowledge, eg as part of the materials taught in the universities for 
medical sciences193, issued guidelines or generally accepted professional litera-
ture194. Non-compliance with these standards necessarily results in fault being 
established but compliance with them does not necessarily mean having com-
plied with the required duty of care195.
</p>
<p>The liability of directors of companies is embedded in the general rules of 
liability for damages. A director breaches his duty if he fails to comply with the 
duties and obligations imposed on him by law. This is the case if a director fails 
to comply with the duties imposed on him by statutory regulation, the memo-
randum of association, the resolutions of the company&rsquo;s supreme body, or by his 
management obligations196. The liability of directors follows the normal fault-
based liability regime of tort law. There does not seem to be any differentiation 
elaborated, for example, treating the duty of care and breaches of the duty of loy-
alty as separate elements or preconditions of liability.
</p>
<p>A director is not liable if he acted according to the required standard of con-
duct, ie if he complied with the requirements for performing his tasks in conduct-
ing the management of the company with due care and diligence as generally re-
quired from persons in such positions and, unless otherwise provided by the law, 
gave priority to the interests of the company. As the required duty of care is an ob-
jective measure independent of the personal skills of the tortfeasor, courts follow

<p>objective standards that require directors to conform to the level of an &raquo; ordinary 
director &laquo; in a position similar to the defendant.
</p>
<p>It is not clear at all what the relationship between the required duty of care 
and the requirement of priority of the company&rsquo;s interests could be. Hungarian 
court practice does not make a clear distinction between these two requirements 
as it does not distinguish clearly between the breach of loyalty and fault. It is, 
however, clear that courts do not establish liability simply on the ground that the 
director made a wrong decision causing damage to the company. There are only 
very few reported cases on this sensitive and crucial element of liability in Hun-
garian court practice but one decision may give an insight into the way of think-
ing of the courts. In this case a director concluded contracts with other partners 
and undertook the obligation of pre-payment for delivery of goods. The goods 
were never delivered and pre-payment could not be revoked. The court rejected 
the claim against the director on the ground that he prepared the transaction with 
the required duty of care and although it proved to be a wrong decision, it was still 
within the scope of normal business risks197.
</p>
<p>Although a clear business judgement rule has not been elaborated or estab-
lished in Hungarian court practice, courts do not establish liability if the conduct 
( decision ) of the director fell within the frames of normal business risks. Thus, 
courts do not want to shift the risks of business decisions to directors of compa-
nies198. If a director fails to protect the assets of a company ( to keep the money in 
a safe place )199 or concludes transactions clearly beyond the normal business risks 
( buying diamond mine concessions in Africa )200 he will have acted negligently and 
will be liable for damages.
</p>
<p>The system of the Civil Code 2013 providing special rules for contractual liabil-
ity will put the nature of professional liability into the foreground. The wrongful 
acts of professionals may cause damage either for their clients or for third parties. 
Their liability vis-&agrave;-vis their clients will be covered by the regime of liability for 
breach of contract while towards third parties by tort law. Contractual liability will 
bring a strict liability with a strong foreseeability limit, while the regime of tort 
law does not bring significant changes in this respect.
</p>
<p>Courts refrain from providing general assessments, guidelines or measures 
in their judgments on the concept of fault. They normally just establish whether 
or not the conduct in question complied with the required duty of care under the 
given circumstances and do not give further evaluation on how persons in similar 
positions are required to act.

</p>
<p>III.   Other defects in the damaging party&rsquo;s own sphere
</p>
<p>The principle of &raquo; respondeat superior &laquo; itself is very old going back to the ancient 
idea of criminal and civil law liability that the household and its head, the &raquo; pater 
familias &laquo;, shall be liable for the wrongs committed by the persons belonging to 
the household community such as wife, children and others. In the structure of 
Hungarian tort law, however, the liability for children and other persons who do 
not have the ability to foresee the consequences of their acts is not construed as 
vicarious liability but the liability of the guardians ( parents or other supervisors ) 
on the ground that, in the course of supervision, they failed to comply with the re-
quired duty of care. Thus, their liability for failure in raising and supervising the 
minor or other mentally disturbed persons is a liability for their own negligence 
which may also cover negligence in raising the child or mentally disturbed person. 
The basic principle has remained and it has been adapted to the continually201 de-
veloping economic and social circumstances with varying degrees of importance 
and often with different ideas behind it. As von Caemmerer has written, the notion 
of the liability of the master for the torts committed by his servants was always 
treated as just and socially necessary202. The roots of the liability of employers for 
their employees may be traced back to this ancient, and in the legal systems in 
some form always present, principle, but in its present form it is a product of a 
modern development of tort law. The liability for damage caused by employees in 
the course of their employment as it stands now in modern private law systems 
is a result of a relatively new development. It is not a logical necessity of a certain 
system and it seems that it cannot be based on the inherent principles of any tort 
law systems today. The liability of employers for damage caused by their employ-
ees in the course of their employment is the result of the dominance of business 
entities and the complex and well organised system of producing and providing 
services which is the result of the division of labour and which is based on using 
services provided by other persons for one&rsquo;s own economic interests.
</p>
<p>Under the title &raquo; Damage Caused by Employees, Members of Cooperatives, 
Representatives, and Agents &laquo; in the Civil Code 1959 three specific forms of liabil-
ity were addressed, namely the liability of employers for employees, the liability 
of principals for agents and the liability of the state for public officers. The Civil 
Code 2013 provides for one additional specific form of liability: the liability of the 
management of legal entities203. As far as the vicarious liability of the employer 
is concerned, if an employee causes damage to a third party in connection with

<p>his employment, unless otherwise provided by law, the employer bears liability 
towards the injured person, provided that the employee himself can be held li-
able. The employer will be liable for the wrongdoing of the employee if the dam-
aging conduct fell within the scope of his employment. This provision is also to 
be applied in the case of a member of a cooperative who causes damage to a third 
party in connection with his membership. Under administrative liability, liability 
for damage caused within the jurisdiction of government administration shall be 
established only if the victim exhausted the ordinary legal remedies without suc-
cess or if there is no common legal remedy to abate the damage. Unless otherwise 
provided by legal regulation, these provisions shall also be applied to liability for 
damage caused within the jurisdiction of a court or public prosecutor. As far as 
liability of principals for agents is concerned, a principal shall be subject to joint 
and several liability with his agent for any damage caused to a third party by the 
agent in this capacity. The principal shall be relieved of liability if he is able to 
prove that he did not act negligently in choosing, instructing, and supervising 
his agent. This provision shall not apply to the liability of persons who perform 
activities involving considerable hazard. In respect of permanent agency, moreo-
ver, if the principal and the agent are economic organisations, the court shall 
be entitled to apply the regulations governing the liability for damage caused by 
employees in the relationship between the aggrieved person and the principal. A 
client shall not be liable for damage caused by his legal representative. An agent 
shall be liable to the principal for any damage he causes, as shall a representa-
tive not employed by a client to that client. A principal or client is entitled to de-
mand reimbursement from an agent or representative for compensation paid by 
the agent or representative to a third party. The provisions of the Labour Code 
and the provisions of separate legal regulations shall be applied to such claims 
between employees and employers and between cooperatives and their members. 
If the employee caused the damage deliberately, he shall be jointly and severally 
liable with the employer204.
</p>
<p>The underlying policy for this solution has been the idea that the agent and 
the employee normally act in the interests of their employer and not in their own 
interests. Liability of the employer and the principal rests on this considera-
tion. The basis of the difference between the employer / employee and the prin-
cipal / agent relationship is the permanent character of the employment relation-
ship and the temporary nature of the latter. This is primarily a question of legal 
qualification of the contractual relationship according to its content. That is why 
the Code provides the possibility to apply the rules of employers&rsquo; liability to cases 
where agency has a permanent character. The damage caused by the employee

be treated as an employee. In this respect the concept of employee also plays an 
important role in jurisdictions where, in the context of vicarious liability, the main 
borderline is to be drawn between employee and independent contractor. The em-
ployer is vicariously liable for harm caused by an employee but not for damage 
caused by an independent contractor. This also implies a constraint of categorisa-
tion, since a person is either one or the other. From the point of view of vicarious li-
ability, there is no third possibility. It is obvious that the very important distinction 
between employee and independent contractor cannot be assessed in the relevant 
cases according to one or more rigid definitions. If the employee or independent 
contractor qualification were a direct result of the qualification of the contract be-
tween the employer and the person who caused harm, this would lead to an insen-
sitive practice which would not reflect the underlying policies of vicarious liability.
</p>
<p>In Hungarian tort law the decisive factor is the qualification of the contractual 
relationship between the employer and the employee. The qualification is based 
on the normal tests for drawing the line between contracts with an independent 
contractor for services ( eg agency contracts ) and contracts of service ( eg employ-
ment or labour contracts ) which are different types of specific contracts in Hun-
garian law. The main differentiating factors are the right and degree of control 
and instructions, the ownership of the means that are necessary to pursue the 
given activity, the management of work and the manner of pricing or remunera-
tion. As a main rule, the employee is only the party to an employment contract, for 
an agent the rule on joint and several liability is applicable and an independent 
contractor shall not be treated as an employee. There are cases where the court 
applied employers&rsquo; vicarious liability to contractual relationships that were not 
qualified as employment contracts205 but it seems that, without a contractual rela-
tionship, one cannot be treated as an employer of another person.
</p>
<p>The other limitation of the employer&rsquo;s responsibility is that he is only liable 
for the wrongdoing of someone who shall be treated as his employee if the con-
duct causing the damage to a third party fell within the course of employment. 
This means that there must be a link between the employment and the harm 
caused to another person. Sometimes this seems to be obvious but there are also 
borderline cases which show that one cannot always decide certain situations by

<p>clear logical means on a theoretical level. Sometimes this problem leads to incon-
sistency in court practice.
</p>
<p>Some tendencies are evident in assessing whether the employee acted within 
the scope of employment or not. The issue is very important because it frames the 
scope of the liability of the employer and determines the risk that shall be shifted 
to him. One of the tendencies is the abandoning of simple approaches and the ap-
plication of a more elaborated system of relevant factors. The courts try to take into 
account all relevant circumstances of the case and they draw such cases into the 
scope of employment which cannot be regarded as part of the activity but which, 
according to rough justice and sense of reality, cannot be separated from it, such as 
committing a crime, lighting a cigarette or abusing functions. The risk of these ac-
tivities is shifted to the employer. At the same time the courts always demand a link 
between the act of the employee and the employment relationship. It may be seen 
as being a pure question of fact but it necessarily also involves legal considerations.
</p>
<p>The formulation &raquo; in connection with his employment &laquo; is relatively wide since 
it also embraces cases where the employee acts outside his strictly defined sphere 
of activity or works outside of the control of his employer206. If, for instance, an 
employee exceeds his authorisation and, as a false procurator, without the right 
to act in the name of his employer, commits a crime with false documents and or-
ders goods, the employer shall be liable vicariously towards the other party with 
whom the contract could not be concluded and who knew nothing about the false 
representation207. If a doctor, on the other hand, acts while on holiday outside the 
territory of his practice without remuneration, his employer is not vicariously li-
able because his activity is not in connection with his employment208. The basis of 
the vicarious liability of the employer is that the employee committed a wrong for 
which he should be liable according to tort law and he may exculpate himself by 
showing that, as an employee, he should not be liable.
</p>
<p>One crucial question to be addressed in the design of a system of vicarious li-
ability is whether the employee remains liable or the vicarious liability of the em-
ployer excludes the liability of the employee against the injured party. This seems 
to be a question of policy. If one stresses the interests of the injured person and 
assumes that the main goal of vicarious liability is to provide cover for the dam-
age, the best solution may be joint and several liability of the employer and the 
employee. In this case the creditor may sue whom he wishes and from whom he 
expects to get quicker and more certain reparation.
</p>
<p>If emphasis is put on the idea that the employee&rsquo;s activity shall be treated as 
the employer&rsquo;s or when reference is had to the social risk allocation function, one

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>should say that not the employee but only the employer is liable. This was the idea 
underlying the Hungarian regulation, according to which the injured party may 
sue only the employer209, and the employer may seek indemnity according to the 
rules of labour law which greatly limit the liability of the employee. In this regime 
only the employer is liable, and he may seek only a limited recovery from the em-
ployee according to labour law.
</p>
<p>The weakest point of the vicarious liability regime is that the decisive element 
is the qualification of the contractual relationship in establishing liability for oth-
ers&rsquo; conduct. This system does not leave enough discretion for the courts to es-
tablish the relevant connection resulting in vicarious liability and a proper risk 
allocation. With the flexible system of tort law, only a flexible concept of vicari-
ous liability could be compatible which can allow the courts to weigh up all the 
relevant factors in the course of assessing if vicarious liability is to be established.
</p>
<p>The Civil Code 2013 does not change the structure of regulation, although it 
refines it at some points, eg by making the employee jointly and severally liable 
with the employer in the case of deliberate wrongdoing. The system is amended 
with a rule covering auxiliaries providing that parties to other contracts are liable 
for damage caused by their obligor with whom they are in a legal relationship in 
the course of performing the contract, unless they name the actual tortfeasor210. 
Vicarious liability of the company for the wrongs of the company&rsquo;s officers is also 
channelled to vicarious liability. As the law stood before the Civil Code 2013, the 
Company Act provided that the company shall be liable for damage caused by the 
company&rsquo;s directors in the course of their position211. The Civil Code 2013, how-
ever, has introduced a new risk allocation regime for directors of companies pro-
viding that, if the executive officer of the legal entity causes damage to a third 
party in connection with his position, the executive officer and the legal entity are 
jointly liable ( towards the victim )212. The contours of this new rule of liability are 
very far from clear. They potentially put a very high risk on managers while court 
practice is still unpredictable.
</p>
<p>In Hungarian tort law, there are no specific rules that would address liability 
for things, except one covering liability for damage caused by animals. A distinc-
tion is made between domestic and wild animals. For harm caused by domestic 
animals, the owner shall be liable according to the general rules of liability, while 
liability for losses caused by wild animals are to be covered with the specific form 
of vicarious liability.

<p>IV.  Dangerousness
</p>
<p>The general rule of liability with its flexible elements and with the system of re-
versed burden of proof concerning fault might be enough to relieve the victim of 
Beweisnotstand ( the need for proof ) and provide a proper regime of risk alloca-
tion for dangerous activities. This rule is in some cases used by the courts in order 
to create strict liability in cases which normally would not fall into the scope of 
such liability regimes213. This can also clearly be seen in shifting the risk allocation 
to hospitals in some cases of medical malpractice.
</p>
<p>Hungarian tort law, however, provides a specific regime for liability for extra-
hazardous activities. According to this specific regime, a person who carries on an 
activity involving considerable hazards shall be liable for any damage the activity 
caused214. The operator shall be relieved of liability if he proves that the damage 
occurred due to an unavoidable cause that fell beyond the scope of the activity in-
volving considerable hazards or resulted from the victim&rsquo;s wrongful conduct. Nei-
ther the scope of the considerably hazardous activity nor the carrier or operator of 
the activity is defined nor are guidelines provided for this. The guidelines for the 
assessment and scope of the considerably hazardous nature of the activity and de-
fining the person ( the operator ) who shall be liable for that activity have been elab-
orated in court practice. In the course of qualifying an activity as considerably haz-
ardous, the court considers all the circumstances of the case. There are activities 
which under certain circumstances shall be considered as considerably hazard-
ous resulting in strict liability, while under other circumstances they would not. In 
</p>
<p>213 Through the application of general tort law regulation, court practice could reach the same 
result as product liability legislation. In a case, decided according to the state of law before 
enacting the Product Liability Act, a child wanted to buy hydrochloric acid in a shop at the re-
quest of her mother. Because of a defect of the bottle, the acid splashed onto her face and made 
her blind. The claimant sued the shop and the assumed manufacturer. The court rejected the 
claim against the manufacturer because it turned out that the shop had bought hydrochloric 
acid from two manufacturers and it was impossible to decide which one of the two manufac-
turers had produced the defective product. The court found the shop liable on the ground of 
liability for extremely hazardous activities and established in this way the strict liability of the 
shop. If the shop as a seller could have proven which manufacturer had produced the product, 
the manufacturer would have been held liable. The court should reach the same result under 
the Product Liability Act of 1993. Supreme Court, Legf. B&iacute;r. Pf. III. 21.046 / 1992 sz. BH 1993 no 678.
</p>
<p>214 Civil Code 1959, &sect; 345. According to the regime of the Civil Code 2013, &sect; 6: 535 f, the operator of 
an extra-hazardous activity shall be obliged to compensate loss resulting from it. He shall be 
relieved of liability by proving that the loss was due to an unavoidable cause that fell outside 
the scope of his activity. The provisions of extra-hazardous activity shall be applied to those 
who endanger human environment and cause damage with their conduct. Any exclusion or 
limitation of liability for extra-hazardous activities is null and void; this restriction does not 
apply to damage to things. The person, in whose interest the activity is carried out, shall be 
deemed operator of the extra-hazardous activity. If there are more operators of the extra-haz-
ardous activity, they shall be qualified as multiple tortfeasors.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>court practice, the operation of motor vehicles or industrial machines, chemicals, 
explosives, acids or other dangerous materials; activities requiring special preven-
tion such as mining, well-digging, etc are specified as considerably hazardous trig-
gering the application of the strict liability regime. Liability for wild animals and 
traditional environmental damage are also governed by the regime of strict liabil-
ity for hazardous activities. Building construction work can also be qualified as 
extremely hazardous, while certain activities &ndash; such as using household machines, 
using fire ( like lighting a cigarette ) &ndash; are regularly not, even if they can really be 
dangerous. The concept of extremely hazardous activities establishing the appli-
cation of this strict liability regime is an open category allowing a wide &raquo; playing 
field &laquo; to the courts. Even if there are typical activities belonging to this category, 
sometimes courts use the openness and abstract nature of this notion simply to 
allocate risks as they think fit through establishing strict liability. Surgical opera-
tions may also be qualified as extra-hazardous activities triggering the strict liabil-
ity of the hospital although normally the liability of medical health care service 
providers falls under the fault-based liability regime215.
</p>
<p>The specific feature of extra-hazardous activities is not only the shifting of the 
required duty of care towards absolute or objective liability but also that it allo-
cates the risk not to the direct tortfeasor but to the operator of the extra-hazardous 
activity. The concept of operator &ndash; as well as the concept of extra-hazardous activ-
ity &ndash; is flexible. The owner is the person who is in a position to control the activity, 
or whose direct interest is pursuing the activity, eg a land-owner who orders chem-
ical vaporisation is to be treated as an operator of the activity and as such will be 
liable under the strict liability regime216. The Civil Code 2013 puts interests in pur-
suing the activity in the foreground by providing that the person in whose interest 
the activity is carried out shall be held to be the operator of the extra-hazardous 
activity217. It is not yet clear how this simplified concept would be interpreted in 
court practice. As, however, &raquo; interest &laquo; is a concept wide enough to imply complex 
interpretations, court practice would presumably not change.
</p>
<p>There is no distinction between holding a dangerous thing and pursuing a 
dangerous activity; holding a dangerous thing can be a dangerous activity falling 
under the application of liability for extra-hazardous activities according to the 
normal tests. There is no special form of enterprise liability in Hungarian tort law.

that make the position of the victim easier. First, liability is imposed on the opera-

</p>
<p>tor of the activity and not only on the person whose conduct actually resulted in 
damage. This, in many cases, results in a multiple tortfeasor scenario as the per-
son, eg the driver of a car, is liable according to the general rules of liability, while 
the operator according to the rules on strict liability for extra-hazardous activities. 
As the risks involved in such activities are mostly insurable, and actually insured, 
there is a greater chance for the victim to be awarded compensation for the loss he 
suffered. Second, there is a very narrow field for the operator because if he cannot 
prove that the cause of damage fell outside of the scope of the activity and was also 
unavoidable, his liability will be established. Courts applied this specific form of 
liability successfully for cases addressed by the product liability regime218.
</p>
<p>In a way, this specific form of liability may result in a better position for the 
victim than the product liability regime, eg there is no exemption for defects that 
could not have been apparent due to the level of scientific and technical develop-
ment. In cases covered by product liability, however, the rules of liability for extra-
hazardous activities are not to be applied219, although Hungarian courts do not 
seem to have implemented the interpretation given by the CJEU which regards the 
Product Liability Directive as a maximum harmonisation regime220.
</p>
<p>V.  Permitted interference
</p>
<p>There are no specific rules or doctrines covering permitted interference in Hun-
garian tort law. If the party agreed to interfere with protected interests, it may be 
a circumstance excluding unlawfulness but only insofar as the wrongdoing is cov-
ered by a valid agreement between the parties. If that is not the case, court prac-
tice does not address the issue of liability in such cases differently.
</p>
<p>VI.  Economic capacity to bear the burden

structural level and also on a practical level. On a theoretical-structural level it

</p>
<p>ployer can and should internalise risks and can spread the costs of those risks 
among contracting parties by incorporating them into the costs of production. 
Thus, costs of risk avoidance can be maintained to an optimum by insurance. The 
aim of protecting the victim justifies the liability of the employer who is usually 
financially stronger and there is no reason to set the injured party against the fi-
nancially weaker employee ( deep-pocket rule ). The employer is able to share the 
costs of the risk shifted to him through vicarious liability among his own business 
partners and consumers as he may incorporate it into the price of his products or 
services221. On a practical level it can either be an element of the flexible system, 
as was suggested by Marton, or a rule for reducing liability, as was provided in the 
Civil Code 1959 and as has been provided in the Civil Code 2013. This provision 
gives the court the opportunity, for special reasons of equity, to award damages 
lower than the loss suffered222. The financial position of the parties is sometimes 
an apparent element of risk allocation even if courts do not expressly refer to it223.
</p>
<p>VII.  Realisation of profit
</p>
<p>That risk should fall where the profit emerges is a general principle of risk allo-
cation which is also one of the bases of vicarious liability. It does not seem, how-
ever, that this view could become a doctrine in Hungarian tort law. Although this 
may be an implied factor in decisions, so far courts have not explicitly referred to 
it. This is certainly part of the test of the required standard of conduct but as the 
arguments brought by the courts are normally not very clear and detailed in this 
respect, it is difficult to assess on the basis of reported cases. This could also have 
been a good basis for introducing enterprise liability but this was not considered 
in the course of preparations of the Civil Code 2013.
</p>

</p>
<p>ultimate risk bearer is not the defendant but an insurance company. The tendency, 
however, seems perceptible that it is much easier for the plaintiff to get compen-
sation if an insurance company is the defendant. Courts incline toward awarding 
damages if the defendant is an insurer or if there is third-party insurance coverage 
available for the defendant. Proving this, however, is very difficult but this may be 
a factor in expanding professional liability in fields where insurance is available 
for the potential defendants, even if third-party insurance is not a basis for estab-
lishing liability. In cases where the insurance company can be directly sued, this 
tendency may be strengthened by the fact that insurance companies mostly try to 
refer to the insurance contract in order to get out of their obligation to pay and are 
less likely to establish their defence on the liability case itself.
</p>
<p>IX.  The notion of a risk community
</p>
<p>Insurance creates a mechanism that not only shifts the risk but also spreads it 
among the members of the risk community. This risk spreading is not only a con-
tractual risk allocation between the insured and the insurance company but also 
an overall model. Not only product liability, but also the system of contractual 
guarantees or other remedies for breach of contract in general can be modelled 
according to this mechanism if the party bearing the contractual or statutory ob-
ligation is in a position to spread the costs of the risk involved among its con-
tracting partners ( consumers ). Companies providing services for a wide range of 
consumers, eg car rental companies, also create a risk community among their 
clients and incorporate the losses into their prices. They also apply contractual 
methods, especially in pricing policies for managing the two structural problems 
of insurance, moral hazard and adverse selection. Insurance as a risk-spreading 
model is an important factor in creating risk communities by regulation like prod-
uct liability, statutory guarantees, consumers&rsquo; rights, etc.
</p>
<p>X.  The interplay of liability criteria
</p>
<p>In theory, there are four prerequisites for liability that are to be defined indepen-
dently from each other: damage, unlawful behaviour, causal link and fault. Hun-
garian tort law is a system of a reversed burden of proof: a causal link between the 
behaviour of the defendant and the damage are to be proven by the plaintiff while 
unlawful behaviour is presumed. In order to be relieved of liability, the plaintiff 
has to prove that his conduct was lawful or that he complied with the required

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>duty of care or other specified grounds for exoneration are present ( in the case of 
specific forms of liability ). The prerequisites for liability, however, never work in 
such a way in the flexible system of tort law.
</p>
<p>The correlation between the content of fault and the dangerousness of the ac-
tivity is already presented on the level of statutory provisions as there is a strict lia-
bility regime provided for extra-hazardous activities. Where liability is strict under 
fault-based liability regimes, like in medical malpractice cases, it is not clear if the 
ground for this is the danger involved or the high ranking of protected rights and 
interests ( life, health, bodily integrity ). It seems that in the structure of Hungar-
ian law such correlations are properly managed by the specific form of liability for 
extra-hazardous activities, which is a flexible regime itself, leaving it to the judge 
to decide which cases are to be brought under this specific regime and the system 
of reversed burden of proof as well as the flexible and objective concept of fault.
</p>
<p>Such interplays, however, exist on a structural level too. Not only can the con-
cept of fault and unlawfulness not be clearly distinguished in practice, as risk al-
locating elements, but also fault and causation can overlap as categories. The re-
sponse of the courts to the problems of pure economic loss or to the problem 
of loss of a chance can be described and approached either as a problem of the 
concept of damage or as causation. Hungarian theory and practice incline to treat 
them as a problem of causation.
</p>
<p>XI.  Contributory responsibility of the victim
</p>
<p>The structure of contributory negligence of the victim may be seen and described 
in more than one way. This may be a reason why different theories can be formu-
lated on this matter. As it is beyond doubt that under the regime of liability in tort, 
only losses caused by other persons can be allocated to them and the victim has 
to bear the loss he caused himself, these different ways seem to lead to the same 
result. The Civil Code itself offers different structures for contributory responsi-
bility.
</p>
<p>In the absence of specific regulation, contributory responsibility can be de-
scribed as a multiple tortfeasors&rsquo; scenario where the victim and the other tortfea-
sor ( s ) caused the damage jointly. In their internal relationship they are propor-
tionally liable as multiple tortfeasors in general and the victim has to bear part 
of the loss according to his contribution. The Civil Code 1959, at the same time, 
explicitly established an obligation for the victim to prevent losses and avoid the 
consequences of wrongdoing as it provided that, in order to prevent and mitigate 
damage, the victim was obliged to act as generally expected under the given cir-
cumstances. This rule was a mirror image of the fault-based liability regime, in

<p>compliance with the principle of equal treatment. Damage which occurred as a 
result of a failure to comply with this duty was not compensated. This rule pro-
vided a solution for liability for the conduct of auxiliaries as it also provided that a 
victim was liable for omissions by persons for whom he was responsible. The Civil 
Code 2013 has maintained this approach and has refined this norm by amending 
it with a rule that damages shall be divided among the tortfeasors in proportion to 
their wrongful conduct or in absence of this, in proportion to their contribution. 
If the proportion of the wrongful conduct and of the respective contribution can-
not be established, the damage shall be compensated by each tortfeasor in equal 
proportions224. Contributory responsibility can never result in eliminating the li-
ability of the tortfeasor.
</p>
<p>Moreover, under the heading of &raquo; liability for extra-hazardous activities &laquo;, the 
regulation provides that a loss shall not be compensated to the extent that it was 
the result of the victim&rsquo;s negligence225, but that the dangerous nature of the activ-
ity must fall into the sphere of the operator, which normally results in applying 
stricter standards to the operator than to the victim226. Courts have a wide discre-
tionary power in weighing the circumstances of the case, evaluating the conduct of 
the parties and considering the other elements of the flexible system when decid-
ing the ratio of risk allocation between the parties. In the context of application of 
this specific rule, it was not clear how the contribution of persons without capac-
ity could be taken into account. Court practice resolved this problem by establish-
ing that the contribution of such persons is irrelevant and is not a proper ground 
to reduce or limit the liability of the operator227. The Civil Code 2013 provides a 
clearer picture providing that the operator is not obliged to compensate damage 
resulting from the contributory negligence of the victim. When apportioning the 
damage, the extra-hazardous quality shall be taken into account to the detriment 
of the operator. If a person who is not capable of foreseeing the consequences of 
his conduct contributes to causing damage, the operator is liable for this person. 
The operator shall be entitled to enforce claims against the supervisor of such per-
sons228. It seems that, although in the context of liability for extra-hazardous activ-

contribution. If even the proportion of their contribution cannot be established, the damage

<p> Part 7 Limitations of liability
</p>
<p>I.  The basic problem of excessive liability
</p>
<p>The limitation of liability is as much inherent to a tort law system as liability itself. 
The conclusion that &raquo; tort law is as much about non-liability as it is about liabil-
ity &laquo;229 also holds true for Hungarian tort law. From the flexible structure of tort law, 
it follows that in the two most important aspects of liability, ie accountability and 
causation, the legislator allows leeway to the greatest extent to court practice, leav-
ing the consideration of the case entirely in the hands of the judge. This means 
that if one tries to seek the limitations of liability, they can also be found in court 
practice. An exception is the statutory authorisation for the courts to reduce dam-
ages on equitable grounds.
</p>
<p>From the flexible nature of tort law follows that the regulation itself does not 
fix the limits of liability but leaves it mostly to court practice without providing 
guidelines on these limitations. This was partly a divergence from the former pri-
vate law, partly a result of development. Former Hungarian private law, before 
World War II, elaborated two important limitations. One of these limitations was 
that economic loss, regardless of whether it was &raquo; pure &laquo; or not, according to the 
modern terminology, could have been compensated only in cases of intention or 
gross negligence. In cases of simple negligence, only the actual damage ( damnum 
emergens ) could have been compensated but not the economic loss230. The other 
important limitation was that even if our tort law did not accept the foreseeability 
limit as a general restriction231, the courts applied it in a great bulk of cases and 
explicitly referred to it. The first limitation, compensating economic loss only in 
cases of intention or gross negligence, has been reduced. The Draft of the Civil 
Code of 1928232 provided that &raquo; extraordinary damage, which occurs as a result of a 
random interference of such circumstances which could not have been foreseen 
by the tortfeasor, is to be compensated only if intention or gross negligence rests 
on the tortfeasor &laquo;233. The second limitation, the foreseeability limit, was not in-
cluded as a special rule in the Civil Code 1959. The reasons for abandoning it are

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>not entirely clear but from theoretical explanations of tort law regulation, it does 
appear that, on the one hand, the foreseeability of the caused harm is implied in 
the test of accountability234 and, on the other hand, the legislator might not want 
to bind the hand of the judge with such limitations and has left the problem of too 
remote causation or too remote damage to be solved in court practice. The Civil 
Code 2013 does not change this. Rules covering causation, however, have been 
amended by a foreseeability limit235 in order to provide a normative tool and a ref-
erence to the courts in order to limit liability in the context of causation, but this 
does not change the law as it stands in court practice236.
</p>
<p>II.  Interruption of the causal link ?
</p>
<p>E&ouml;rsi, whose liability theory most influenced the tort law system of the Civil Code 
1959, in an essay in 1985 about the limits of indirect causation237, tried to list the 
possible limitation measures within causation. His starting point was that the 
principle of full compensation and causation are two main pillars of tort law regu-
lation. Causation is, however, a chain, which flows from the past to the future ex-
tending at the same time in different, divergent branches creating new chains of 
causes. Such being the case there are many situations where full compensation is 
&raquo; summum ius, summa iniuria &laquo;. It is obvious that tort law must avoid such situa-
tions and the main way to do this is by limitation of liability, even when it is im-
possible to draw the exact boundaries of indirect causation or indirect damage.
</p>
<p>According to E&ouml;rsi these possible limitation measures are:
</p>
<p>a. restricting liability to foreseeable harms;
b. the doctrine of adequate causality;
c. the doctrine of normal consequences;
d. the test of remoteness of damage;
e. the doctrine of organic causal connection;
f. the risk allocation aspect;
g. the principle of proportionality;
h. the doctrine of reasonable connection between the harm and the threat.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>These measures are the main possible means of doctrinal limitation of liability 
and they provide appropriate guidelines for Hungarian legal practice. E&ouml;rsi reck-
ons that foreseeability not only has a limitative effect, but an extensive one also. 
Abstract foreseeability, on the one hand, has a limitative effect, because only ac-
tual foreseeability establishes liability, but actual foreseeability, on the other hand, 
may also be established in cases where the concrete process of the case could not 
have been foreseen238.
</p>
<p>To sum up how these doctrines contribute to Hungarian court practice, one 
can say that the court may limit liability and refuse full compensation by dismiss-
ing the claim for damages if the harm was:
</p>
<p> ▷ unforeseeable to the tortfeasor ( foreseeability doctrine );
 ▷ beyond rational probability, untypical or unique ( adequate causality );
 ▷ beyond the normal consequences and too unexpected239;
 ▷ a too remote consequence of the tortfeasor&rsquo;s conduct240;
 ▷ caused at least in part by the interference of an unexpected cause in the causal 
</p>
<p>link which altered the normal foreseeable consequences241;
 ▷ within normal risk imputed to the aggrieved party242; or if full compensation 
</p>
<p>would be disproportionate considering the amount of damage and the degree 
of fault243.
</p>
<p>These doctrines and guidelines are to be treated as elements of a flexible sys-
tem which provide, through the open rules of tort law regulation, the measures 
to carry out appropriate risk allocation. Court practice has found its limitation

239 That was the reason for dismissing the claim against a hospital in a case where a mentally ill 
</p>
<p>person fled from the hospital, got on a train without a ticket and when the controller asked for 
the ticket, committed suicide by jumping out from the train. E&ouml;rsi, A k&ouml;zvetett k&aacute;rok hat&aacute;rai 62.
</p>
<p>240 This is the case where someone cuts a telecommunication earth-cable with a machine during 
excavation works and thousands of people ( including factories ) remain without telephone ser-
vices and because of the damaged cable it is impossible to call the police, the fire brigade or 
the ambulance. In this case the tortfeasor shall not be liable for all these further consequential 
losses, because they are too remote. E&ouml;rsi, A k&ouml;zvetett k&aacute;rok hat&aacute;rai 63.
</p>
<p>241 This may be used as a limitative factor if the tortfeasor tempts a child to commit a crime and 
because of this the child&rsquo;s mother commits suicide. For the death of the mother, the tortfeasor 
shall not be liable. E&ouml;rsi, A k&ouml;zvetett k&aacute;rok hat&aacute;rai 63.
</p>
<p>242 This is the basis of the limitation of liability if someone destroys a bridge or causes an accident 
and because of it traffic is diverted to a longer route. The diverting of traffic is an event which 
may occur for a number of reasons, even ( and mostly ) without someone&rsquo;s fault; this is why it 
is an event that everyone must reckon with and as such it is a general risk of life ( allgemeines 
Lebensrisiko ). This risk must be run by everyone and others cannot be held liable for this.

<p>243 If in a so-called cable-case, a whole district remains without electricity because of the conduct 
of the tortfeasor whose negligence was not gross, the liability includes the costs of reparation 
and the economic loss of the electricity operator but not the harm and loss of the people and 
businesses who are left without electricity. E&ouml;rsi, A k&ouml;zvetett k&aacute;rok hat&aacute;rai 65.

</p>
<p>measures in order to optimise risk allocation within the complex concept of ac-
countability and in causation instead of by a doctrine based on pure economic 
loss or such a category. Hungarian courts incline to cut off the causation link at 
losses deemed too remote, and they use the concept of accountability to reduce 
the tortfeasor&rsquo;s liability to foreseeable losses or they simply solve the problem 
regarding the causal link and the amount of the damage due with the burden of 
proof. The burden of proof is a very effective measure in the course of risk alloca-
tion, also regarding economic loss: the plaintiff has to prove that if the tortfeasor&rsquo;s 
conduct had not occurred, he certainly would not have suffered loss or with abso-
lute certainty would have earned a certain profit.
</p>
<p>III.  Adequacy
</p>
<p>Legal causation would seem to be a reasonable tool for limiting liability and a 
huge amount of literature has been built upon different theories of adequacy. It 
seems, however, that court practice does not use such theories and there has never 
been a proper description provided on how such theories would work in a predict-
able manner. It seems that theories of adequacy prove to be a dead end and the 
product of the general misunderstanding of the nature of causation of law and 
the failure of attempts to apply the philosophical concept of causation to causa-
tion in law.
</p>
<p>IV.  The protective purpose of the rule
</p>
<p>Although the protective purpose of the rule is an important factor for limiting lia-
bility, neither in court practice nor in theory has such a doctrine been established. 
Teleological interpretation is accepted in Hungarian private law as well, although 
it is difficult to assess to what extent and in what sense as it is not referred to in 
judgments. The protective purpose of the norm has not yet been formulated in 
Hungarian court practice or legal theory in the form in which it is present in Ger-
man and Austrian legal doctrine. In spite of this, the function of legal institutions, 
including the goal of the legislator and the purpose of the rule, play an important 
rule in risk allocation. This happens, however, mostly by rejecting a claim on the 
ground of absence of a causal link without referring to such a doctrine. It seemed 
that the theory on the doctrine of protective purpose of the norm started to de-
velop in professional discussions on contractual and non-contractual liability but 
further improvements are still not detectable. Professional debates on indirect

</p>
<p>causation so far have been focused on the problem of whether the damage suf-
fered by a company can be a ground for a tort claim by a shareholder ( member ) 
of the company too, referring to the shareholder&rsquo;s loss suffered in the value of the 
share. Neither these debates nor court practice reached the conclusion that the 
tortfeasor&rsquo;s mostly contractual obligations are limited in their scope to protecting 
the company&rsquo;s interests and should not cover the protection of its shareholders&rsquo; 
interests. An approach is, however, taking shape that if the plaintiff bases his tort 
claim on conduct constituting a breach of a contractual obligation vis-&agrave;-vis him-
self or third parties, the tort claim shall not be decided without deciding the con-
tractual claim. Deciding the claim for damages for breach of contract, ie establish-
ing liability for breach of contract, is a necessary preliminary question in respect 
of the tort claim in such cases and the court has to take into account the fact that 
the contracting parties enjoy privity as a main rule, ie a contract creates obliga-
tions vis-&agrave;-vis the other contractual party but not vis-&agrave;-vis anyone else244. Later, in 
a judgment, the Supreme Court established that the lawful termination of a con-
tract for a loan with a company does not establish any claim of a shareholder for 
damages vis-&agrave;-vis the bank that terminated the contract for the loan. The Supreme 
Court, however, did not go as far as establishing that shareholders&rsquo; claims for indi-
rect damages on the basis of the damage suffered by the company ( eg as compen-
sation for loss in the value of the shares ) are to be excluded per se  245.

<p> Part 8 Compensation of damage
</p>
<p>I.  Extent of compensation
</p>
<p>As a main rule, the party liable shall be obliged to restore the original state and 
shall be liable for damages if restoring the original state is not possible without 
violating the interests of the victim. The primary obligation for restoring the state 
has not been maintained in the Civil Code 2013 but this does not change the start-
ing point that Hungarian tort law rests on the principle of full compensation.
</p>
<p>II.  Types of compensation
</p>
<p>Thus, the tortfeasor who is responsible for the damage shall be liable for restoring 
the original state, or, if this is not possible or if the aggrieved party refuses restora-
tion on a reasonable ground, will be liable to compensate the aggrieved party for 
pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. Compensation must provide for any depre-
ciation in the value of the property belonging to the aggrieved person and for any 
pecuniary advantage lost due to the tortfeasor&rsquo;s conduct as well as for compensa-
tion of the costs necessary for the attenuation or elimination of the victim&rsquo;s pe-
cuniary and non-pecuniary loss. Under pecuniary loss, actual damage ( damnum 
emergens ), lost pecuniary advantage ( lucrum cessans ) and costs necessary for the 
attenuation or elimination of the victim&rsquo;s pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss are to 
be understood. Actual loss is diminution in value of the victim&rsquo;s property as a re-
sult of loss, destruction of or damage to a thing and the loss of value remaining in 
spite of repairs or the sum or value of services paid to another person as a result of 
the tortfeasor&rsquo;s act, such as penalty, compensation, etc. Lost pecuniary advantage 
is the lost salary, profit or alimony, as far as the alimony has been provided as a gra-
tuity, provided that such advantage was legal and morally acceptable. Costs neces-
sary for the attenuation or elimination of the pecuniary loss cover costs that were 
reasonably necessary in order to avoid or reduce the loss or the consequences of it 
including costs arising from death ( like burial ) or personal injury ( costs of medi-
cal care, implants, visits to the hospital, traffic costs ), costs of repairs and costs of 
enforcing one&rsquo;s rights. Compensable pecuniary loss is always a net value, ie the 
negative balance of gains and losses suffered as the result of the tortfeasor&rsquo;s act246.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>This approach implies the principle of full compensation which is followed 
very strictly in Hungarian court practice and sets the limits of liability too as it 
supposes damages as a compensation for compensable loss. Normally it is the 
market value that is awarded as compensation for actual patrimonial loss. Accord-
ing to prevailing theories in Hungarian tort law, the main functions of liability in 
private law are reparation and prevention. These are also the underlying policies 
of the current system of tort law. A general principle of Hungarian tort law is that 
the victim should be prevented from making a profit on the loss. It seems that res-
titutionary damages or claims for the gained benefit to be shifted from the tort-
feasor to the victim ( in order to deprive the tortfeasor of the profit that he gained 
from the wrongful conduct ) are compatible with the principles and policies un-
derlying Hungarian tort law247. Thus, in the course of calculating the sum of dam-
ages to be awarded, the amount of damages shall be reduced by the sum that the 
victim earned or saved as a result of the damage eg payments under a national 
health care system248 or an increase in value of the victim&rsquo;s property as a result of 
the event which caused damage. In line with the principle of full compensation, 
the plaintiff shall be compensated for all the losses that he suffered but may not 
receive an extra income249.
</p>
<p>Damages also cover losses that will be suffered as a consequence of the wrong-
doing in the future, including lost earnings. Loss of working capacity itself ( with-
out at least presumed loss of earnings ) does not seem to be an accepted type of 
compensable loss in Hungarian tort law. It seems that even if courts speak of loss 
of working capacity in the context of damages, they understand presumed loss of 
earnings. The victim is to be compensated for loss of earnings resulting from the 
injury he suffered250. Loss of earning capacity is compensated by the compensa-
tion received for loss of earnings which is indemnified based on the victim&rsquo;s pre-
dictable income in the future. In the course of calculating the compensation for 
loss of earnings, however, the actual status of the victim is not necessarily deci-
sive. The basis for the calculation of damages is the actual ( lost ) earnings of the 
victim251, while the reference for calculating the compensation for lost earnings in 
the future is the average earnings of people who have the same or a similar job to 
that of the victim before he lost it as a result of the injury suffered. This holds true 
also in the context of increasing the annuity ( periodical payment ) awarded earlier 
as damages252.

</p>
<p>These principles elaborated in theory and court practice are reinforced in the 
rules of the Civil Code 2013 too.
</p>
<p>III.  Periodic or lump sum
</p>
<p>The principle of full compensation requires compensating the victim for all the 
losses he suffered as a result of the tortfeasor&rsquo;s wrongful conduct. It is up to the 
court to decide whether compensation in one lump sum or in the form of periodic 
payments is the most appropriate form of indemnification253. Basically, there are 
two ways of providing compensation for losses that are uncertain in their amount 
either because they will only arise in the future or because, although they have 
already been incurred by the victim and their existence is proven as a fact, their 
amount is impossible to prove.
</p>
<p>One possible way of compensating losses of an uncertain amount is award-
ing general damages. General damages ( as lump sum compensation ) are to be 
awarded if the extent of the damage &ndash; at least partly &ndash; cannot be precisely calcu-
lated. In such a case the tortfeasor can be compelled by the court to pay a lump 
sum of general indemnification that would be sufficient to provide the victim with 
full financial compensation. Awarding general damages is regarded as full and 
final compensation and there is no possibility to reclaim a lump sum general in-
demnification on the grounds that the extent of actual damage did not subse-
quently equate with the amount of the general indemnification. If, however, the 
obligor is paying an annuity as general indemnification, he shall be entitled to 
demand a reduction in the amount of the annuity or a change in the annuity pay-
ment period in accordance with any changes in the relevant conditions. Courts 
normally try to avoid awarding lump sum compensation amounts and do so only 
if it was impossible to prove the amount of loss although the fact of suffering com-
pensable loss is proven ( difficulties in proving the amount of the loss suffered it-
self is not a sufficient basis for awarding such compensation )254.
</p>
<p>The other possible way of compensating future losses is awarding damages as 
a periodical payment in the form of an annuity. As a general rule, compensation 
may be awarded in the form of an annuity as well. An annuity is normally awarded 
if indemnification is designed to support or assist in the support of the aggrieved 
person or those of his relatives who are entitled to be supported by him.
</p>
<p>It seems that in regulation and in court practice, awarding annuities domi-
nates over lump sum compensation if there are future losses to be compensated.

</p>
<p>This may be the influence of the practice of the socialist era but it also may be in-
evitable that annuities may be a more just and correct method of compensation 
as they can be adapted to future changes. Awarding a lump sum compensation 
amount for future losses necessarily involves a weighing up of probabilities in-
volving the problems of discounting the future loss from the recent value. It may, 
however, be more compatible with the market economy and has the benefit of 
closing the claim. As there is actually no practice of Hungarian courts awarding 
lump sums as compensation of future losses, it is not clear how such an award 
would be calculated and discounted.
</p>
<p>IV.  Reduction of the duty to compensate
</p>
<p>Generally, there are no statutory caps or thresholds for damages and caps or 
thresholds have not been developed in court practice either. The courts follow the 
principle of full compensation which implies only that they reduce the awarded 
compensation in accordance with damage that has already been compensated 
from other sources, like payments from the national health insurance, disability 
pensions, earnings on the loss, etc. In general neither statutory regulation nor 
court practice provides liability caps under the non-contractual liability regime255. 
Regulatory caps are provided only in very specific cases256. Otherwise, the statu-
tory capping of liability is not a typical solution for limitation of liability in Hun-
garian tort law. There are no caps in court practice although in some cases court 
practice limits liability only to compensation of actual damage and does not ac-
cept claims for compensation of lost profit ( such as damages for illicit tendering ). 
Statutory caps seem to take as a starting point that the tortfeasor&rsquo;s overall liability 
is capped by a maximum amount without making a distinction between primary 
and consequential loss or postulating the plurality of several independent losses.
</p>
<p>255 There are statutory liability caps for certain cases of contractual liability ( mainly in the field of 
carriage of persons and goods and providing hosting services like hotels, public houses, etc ) 
but &ndash; taking into consideration the scope of the project &ndash; I shall not address them in this report.
</p>
<p>256 Act no CXVI. of 1996 on Nuclear Energy, eg provides in its &sect; 52 that liability of the operators 
of nuclear plants, nuclear heating plants and operators of factories producing, processing or 
storing nuclear fuel shall not exceed the sum of SDR 100,000,000 per accident. Liability of 
operators of other types of nuclear establishments and liability for compensating damage oc-
curring in the course of transporting or storing nuclear fuel shall not exceed the sum of SDR 
5,000,000 per accident. The Hungarian state shall be obliged to compensate damage that ex-
ceeds this limit but the whole sum to be paid shall not exceed the sum of SDR 300,000,000. 
There also are caps for specific cases of contractual liability such as liability of air carriers or 
operators of hotels and public houses.

<p> Part 9 Prescription of compensation claims
</p>
<p>I.  The basic principles of the law of prescription
</p>
<p>Although it may seem normal to lawyers that claims expire after a certain period of 
time, it is far from being self-evident that, if the creditor fails to exercise the right 
allocated to him by law, he may lose it automatically. Although there may be se-
rious concerns about whether such results are compatible with the protection of 
property in a constitutional sense or from the point of view of protecting property 
as a human right, the protection of reliance on the other party&rsquo;s conduct, even if 
it is the non-exercising of a right, may be proper ground for the legislator or for 
court practice in balancing the interests of the parties this way. There are basically 
three technical solutions for extinguishing claims or barring the creditor from 
turning to court in order to enforce his claim.
</p>
<p>The first is prescription, which results in the creditor not being able to enforce 
his claim via judicial procedure, ie he is barred from turning to the court with the 
claim. The problem with prescription is that legal systems normally accept that 
this period can be interrupted and begin anew and also can &raquo; rest &laquo; and continue 
again. This may leave the debtor in an uncertain position about whether the credi-
tor can or will enforce the claim against him or not. The second approach is estab-
lishing dates of expiration that set out when the claim ceases to exist. The advan-
tage of fixed expiration dates is that they make the positions of the parties clear; 
the disadvantage is that it can result in overly harsh consequences for the creditor 
by depriving him of his position even if he could not enforce it due to grounds that 
fall beyond his control. The third solution is that courts interpret general clauses 
of private law, like good faith and fair dealing or the generally required duty of 
care in a way so as to imply a duty to act in order to enforce claims if this can af-
fect the position of other parties. Hungarian court practice construed the general 
clause of good faith and fair dealing and the required duty of care as implying a 
deadline for having recourse to the court in cases of transfer of property with in-
terference in pre-emption rights of the plaintiff. The court established in some 
such cases that, if the beneficiary of the pre-emption right failed to turn to court 
in a reasonable time after discovering the wrongful interference with his right, he 
should be deprived of his right257.

</p>
<p>II.  Present legal position
</p>
<p>The general period of limitation for claims in Hungarian law is five years, unless 
otherwise prescribed by law. In tort law, there are basically two exceptions. This 
period starts at the time of occurrence of damage as it is the point in time that 
the obligation to compensate the victim becomes due258. One exception is that 
claims for damage resulting from extra-hazardous activities shall be prescribed 
after three years; the other is that if the harm was caused by a crime, the prescrip-
tion period for damages cannot be shorter than the prescription period for crim-
inal law liability. After the prescription period elapses, the claim cannot be en-
forced in court. The period of limitation commences on the due date of the claim. 
If the creditor is unable to enforce a claim for an excusable reason, the claim shall 
remain enforceable for an additional year from the time when the said reason is 
eliminated or, in respect of a period of limitation of one year or less, it stays valid 
for three months after such reason is eliminated, even if the period of limitation 
has already lapsed or there is less than one year or three months, respectively, re-
maining thereof. This provision also applies if the creditor has granted respite for 
performance after expiration. This means that in the system of the Hungarian law 
of obligations today, the &raquo; standstill &laquo; of the claim means an additional deadline 
applies in respect of the creditor turning to the court, whereas the prescription 
does not continue.
</p>
<p>The period of prescription can be interrupted by a written notice for perfor-
mance of a claim, the judicial enforcement of a claim, the amendment of a claim 
by agreement ( including its content ), and the acknowledgment of a debt by the 
obligor. The period of limitation shall recommence after suspension or following 
the non-appealable outcome of a suspension proceeding. If a writ of execution is 
issued in the course of a suspension proceeding, the period of limitation shall be 
suspended only by the acts of enforcement. This system of interrupting prescrip-
tion remains structurally similar in the Civil Code 2013, although written notice in 
itself is not sufficient ground for interrupting prescription. Basically, the law re-
quires the creditor to turn to the court during the prescription period in order not 
to lose the right to enforce the claim.
</p>
<p>The limitation period starts to run only at the time the obligation is due. Li-
ability for damages cannot be due until the harm has occurred and this holds true 
even for damage which could have been foreseen. If the victim suffers damage as a 
result of the tortfeasor&rsquo;s conduct but damage resulting from the same conduct oc-
curs at different points of time, the claims for compensation of damage are to be 
due according to the occurrence of the damage event, each adjusted to the points 
</p>
<p>258 Civil Code 1959, &sect; 360 ( 1 ); Civil Code 2013, &sect; 6: 532. Damages are due immediately from the date 
of the occurrence of damage.

</p>
<p>of time of occurrence. These points of time establish the commencement date of 
the limitation periods for each compensation claim259.
</p>
<p>III.  Attempt to find rules on prescription that are 
consistent with the system and value judgements
</p>
<p>Perhaps it is impossible to establish a proper period of prescription. Balancing 
the interests of parties in different positions cannot be resolved on an abstract 
level. Preparing enforcement consumes very different amounts of time. Especially 
in cases of personal injury, the victim has to arrive at the position of defining the 
injury and the losses resulting from it. If treatment takes several years and fu-
ture incomes are to be assessed, this may take years while in a simple case of a 
car crash without personal injury, the victim may be required to turn to the court 
within months.
</p>
<p>The best solution could be to require the creditor to turn to the court within a 
reasonable period of time, with a general clause which would allow the courts to 
assess what the reasonable time under the given circumstances was260 and fixing 
a statutory date of expiration of claims in order to allow the conclusion of open 
claims. Such a solution, however, seems to be unacceptable for a practice which 
requires fixed and concrete rules; such a demand was expressed many times in the 
course of drafting the Civil Code 2013.

<p>6 : 523. &sect;  
[ Danger of loss ]
</p>
<p>In case of danger of suffering loss, the per-
son in danger may ask the court, according 
to the circumstances of the case,
</p>
<p>a )  to prohibit the person who threatens 
to cause damage from proceeding with 
dangerous conduct;
</p>

<p>( 1 ) If two or more persons caused damage 
jointly, they are jointly and severally liable.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) The court shall be entitled to exempt 
the tortfeasors from joint and several liabil-
ities if the injured party contributed in the 
occurrence of damage or this is reasonable 
under special and equitable circumstances. 
In the case that the court refrains from 
holding the tortfeasors jointly and severally 
liable, the court shall declare their liability 
in proportion to the extent of their wrong-
ful conduct or if the former cannot be deter-
mined in proportion to the extent of their 
contribution. If the proportion of contri-
bution cannot be established, the damage 
shall be compensated by each tortfeasor in 
equal proportions.
</p>
<p>( 3 ) Damage shall be borne by the tortfea-
sors proportionally according to their wrong-
ful conduct; if the proportion of wrongful 
conduct cannot be established, damage 
shall be borne by the tortfeasors in propor-
tion to the extent of their contribution. If 
even the proportion of contribution cannot 
be established, damage shall be borne by 
each tortfeasor in equal proportions.
</p>
<p>( 4 ) The provisions of multiple tortfea-
sors shall be applied if the damage might 
have been caused by any one of the several 
</p>
<p>courses of conduct engaged in at the same 
time, or it cannot be established, which 
conduct caused the damage.
</p>
<p>6 : 525. &sect;  
[ Contribution of the injured party ]
</p>
<p>( 1 ) The injured person is obliged to prevent 
and mitigate the damage. Damage which 
occurs as a result of breaching this obliga-
tion wrongfully shall not be compensated.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) Damage shall be divided among the 
tortfeasor and the injured party in propor-
tion of their wrongful conduct or in absence 
of this, in proportion to their contribution. 
If even the proportion of their contribution 
cannot be established, the damage shall be 
compensated by the tortfeasor and the in-
jured party in equal proportions.
</p>
<p>( 3 ) The injured party is liable for omis-
sions of those for whom he is liable.

<p>( 2 ) In order to compensate regular future 
damage the court is entitled to establish an-
nuity to be paid regularly in advance.

and the extent of the loss of income.
</p>
<p>( 3 ) The loss of earnings ( income ) of the 
injured party shall be established by the 
monthly average income of the previous 
year. If there was a permanent change in in-
come in this year, the average income after 
the change shall be taken into account.

<p>( 5 ) To establish the loss of income, any 
change in the future that may be expected 
shall be taken into account.

<p>( 1 ) In the case of death resulting from the 
injury the annuity complementing support 
shall be paid to the dependant of the de-
ceased person. The annuity complementing 
support shall be paid by the tortfeasor even 
if this consequence of his conduct was not 
foreseeable.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) The tortfeasor is obliged to pay annu-
ity complementing support even if the de-
ceased person did not pay the support by 
breaching the relating provisions, or the pe-
titioner did not enforce his claim for an eq-
uitable reason.
</p>
<p>( 3 ) To establish the extent of the annuity 
complementing support, the lost support 
and the income of the petitioner shall be 
taken into account.
</p>
<p>( 4 ) If the adequate income is not in the pos-
session of the petitioner for wrongful rea-
</p>
<p>son, furthermore, if he is entitled to enforce 
claims against others who are in the same 
position in support, this shall be taken into 
account to establish the extent of annuity.
( 5 ) In further cases, to establish the annu-
ity the provisions on establishing annuity 
supplementing income shall be taken into 
account.

caused by crime shall not expire after five 
years as long as the crime is subject to pen-
alty.

resulting from it. He shall be relieved of li-
ability by proving that the loss was due to 
an unavoidable cause that fell outside the 
scope of his activity.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) The provisions of extra-hazardous ac-
tivity shall be applied to those who endan-
ger human environment and cause damage

[ The operator ]
</p>
<p>( 1 ) The person, in whose interest the activ-

<p>damage, the extra-hazardous quality shall 
be taken into account to the detriment of 
the operator.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) If a person, who is not capable of fore-
seeing the consequences of his conduct, 
contributes in causing damage, the opera-
tor is liable for this person. The operator 
shall be entitled to enforce a claim for re-
imbursement against the supervisor of the 
person mentioned above at ( 1 ).

</p>
<p>( 4 ) The provisions of this &sect; shall be ap-
plied in relations among the operators 
when more extra-hazardous activities cause 
damage together with the exception, that in 
the absence of wrongful conduct and disor-
der within their scope of activity, they are 
obliged to pay damages in equal proportion.

</p>
<p>and members of legal entities ]
</p>
<p>( 1 ) If an employee causes damage to a 
third party in the course of his employment, 
his employer shall be liable to the victim.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) If a member of a legal entity causes 
damage to a third party in connection with 
his membership, the legal entity shall be li-
able to the injured party.
</p>
<p>( 3 ) The employee and the member are 
jointly and severally liable with the em-
ployer and the legal entity, if the damage 
arises from deliberateness.
</p>
<p>6 : 541. &sect;  
[ Liability for damage caused by the executive 
</p>
<p>officer of the legal entity ]
</p>

tity causes damage to a third party in con-
nection with his legal relation, the executive

[ Liability for damage caused by the agent ]
</p>
<p>( 1 ) A principal shall be jointly and sever-
ally liable with his agent for any damage 
caused to a third party by the agent in such 
capacity. The principal shall be relieved of 
liability if he proves that he was not negli-
gent in choosing, instructing, and supervis-
ing the agent.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) In case of long-term agency the injured 
party may enforce his claim of indemnifica-
tion on the basis of the provisions of dam-

<p>6 : 543. &sect;  
[ Liability for damage caused by the obligor  
</p>

the consequences of his conduct ]
</p>
<p>( 1 ) A person who is mentally distracted to 
the extent that he is not capable of foresee-
ing the consequences of his conduct shall 
not be liable for damage caused by him.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) Instead of the tortfeasor, his guardian 
according to the law shall be liable. The su-
pervisor qualifies as guardian if he was su-

<p>( 3 ) The guardian shall be relieved of liabil-
ity if he proves that he was not negligent in 
nursing or supervising.

guardians, the provisions of multiple tort-
feasors shall be applied.

ble in the given circumstances and accord-
ing to the financial capacity of the parties.</p>

<p>If the damage is caused by a minor who is 
capable of foreseeing the consequences of

<p>Liability for Damage Caused  
by Exercising Public Authority

<p>6 : 548. &sect;  
[ Liability for damage caused within the 
course of exercising public administrative  
</p>
<p>authority ]
</p>
<p>( 1 ) Liability for damage caused within 
the course of public administrative author-
ity shall be established only if the damage 
was caused by act or omission of the public 
authority and the damage could not be re-
lieved by ordinary legal remedies and by ju-
dicial review of the administrative decision.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) The legal entity exercising public admin-
istrative authority is liable for damage caused 
within the course of public adminis-tration. 
If the person exercising public administra-
tive authority is not a legal entity, the super-
vising legal entity shall be liable for damage 
caused by the acts of the public authority.

[ Liability for damage caused within the 
</p>
<p> authority of court, notary, public prosecutor 
and public enforcement ]
</p>
<p>( 1 ) For damage caused within the author-
ity of court and public prosecutor, the provi-
sions on causing damage within the course 
</p>
<p>of exercising public administrative author-
ity shall be properly applied with the dis-
tinction that the claim for indemnifica-
tion shall be enforced against the court or 
the supreme prosecutor. If the court that 
caused the damage is not a legal entity, the 
claim shall be enforced against a court that 
has legal personality and works in the area 
of the court that caused the damage. The 
precondition for such claim is an unsuc-
cessful previous ordinary remedy.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) For damage caused within the author-
ity of notary and public enforcement, the 
provisions on causing damage within the 
course of exercising public administrative 
authority shall be properly applied. The pre-
condition for such claim is an unsuccessful 
previous ordinary remedy.

<p>damaged property is of a type ordi-
narily intended for private use or con-
sumption, and was used by the injured 
person mainly for his own private use 
or consumption.
</p>
<p>6 : 553. &sect;  
[ The producer ]
</p>
<p>( 1 ) For the purpose of this Chapter pro-
ducer means the manufacturer of a finished 
product, the manufacturer of a component 
part or any raw material and any person 
who, by putting his name, trade mark or 
other distinguishing feature on the product 
presents himself as its producer.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) Any person who imports products into 
the European Economic Area for sale or any 
economic purpose shall be deemed to be a 
producer. This rule shall not influence the 
importer&rsquo;s recourse claim for indemnifica-
tion against the producer.
</p>
<p>( 3 ) Where the producer of the product can-
not be identified, each supplier of the prod-
uct shall be treated as its producer, until the 
supplier informs the injured person of the 
identity of the producer or the person who 
supplied him with the product. The same 
shall apply, in the case of an imported prod-
uct, if the product does not indicate the 
identity of the importer, even if the name of 
the producer is indicated.
</p>
<p>( 4 ) From the time the injured person 
claimed the identification of the producer 
in written form, the supplier can make his 
statement in thirty days.
</p>
<p>6 : 554. &sect;  
[ Defect of the product ]
</p>
<p>( 1 ) A product is defective when it does not 
provide the safety which a person is entitled 
to expect, taking into account the function 
of the product, the use to which it could rea-
sonably be expected that the product would 
be put, the presentation concerning the 
product, the time when the product was put 
into circulation, and the state of scientific 
and technical knowledge.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) A product shall not be considered de-
fective for the sole reason that a safer prod-
uct is subsequently put into circulation.
</p>
<p>( 3 ) The injured person shall be required to 
prove the defect of the product.
</p>
<p>6 : 555. &sect;  
[ Release from liability ]
</p>
<p>( 1 ) The producer shall not be liable, if he 
proves that
</p>
<p>a )  he did not put the product into circula-
tion;
</p>
<p>b )  the product was neither manufactured 
by him for sale or any form of distribu-
tion for economic purpose nor manu-
factured or distributed by him in the 
course of his business;
</p>
<p>c )  the defect did not exist at the time 
when the product was put into circula-
tion by him and the cause of the defect 
came into being afterwards;
</p>
<p>d )  the state of scientific and technical 
knowledge at the time when he put the 
product into circulation was not such 
as to enable the existence of the defect 
to be discovered; or
</p>
<p>e )  the defect of the product is due to the ap-
plication of law or other mandatory reg-
ulations issued by the public authorities.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) The manufacturer of a component part 
or any raw material shall not be liable, if he 
proves, that
</p>
<p>a )  the defect is attributable to the con-
struction or composition of the fin-
ished product in which the component 
has been fitted; or
</p>
<p>b )  the defect is attributable to the instruc-
tions given by the manufacturer of the 
finished product.
</p>
<p>( 3 ) The producer shall not be released 
from liability even referring to Subsection 
( 1 )  d )  if the damage was caused by a phar-
maceutical product used according to its in-
structions.</p>

</p>
<p>The producer shall not be released from li-
ability even if the damage was caused both

</p>
<p>The limitation or exclusion of the produc-

struction and maintenance have not been 
breached and that he has not acted wrong-
fully during construction or maintenance in 
order to prevent the damage.
</p>
<p>( 2 ) The provisions of Subsection 1 shall be

gation if he proves that the tortfeasor&rsquo;s pres-
ence in the place was unlawful.
</p>

<p> Preliminary Remarks
</p>
<p>I. General introduction 
The aim of this chapter is to provide an English and ( within limits ) Common-
wealth perspective on the fundamental ideas elaborated in Helmut Koziol&rsquo;s &raquo; Basic 
Questions of Tort Law from a Germanic Perspective &laquo;. That book is so rich in its 
argumentation that the selection of particular ideas within it as &raquo; fundamental &laquo; 
runs the risk of omitting others that are no less or perhaps even more important. 
But the task I was set requires me to grasp the nettle, though I would observe by 
way of mitigation that the ideas I have chosen to highlight struck me as especially 
likely to resonate with English and Commonwealth lawyers. 
</p>
<p>II. The fundamental ideas in the &raquo; Basic Questions &laquo;
</p>
<p>Formulated in my own words, the fundamental ideas to be found in the &raquo; Basic 
Questions &laquo; are the following:

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>1. The law of tort1 should be seen as part of a comprehensive system that secures 
the protection of &raquo; legal goods &laquo;. This system includes not merely the various 
divisions of private law ( tort, contract, unjust enrichment, etc ) but also vari-
ous mechanisms of a public law character, including criminal law and social 
security law. 
</p>
<p>2. This overall system of protective mechanisms should be consistent in the fol-
lowing respects2: it should be based on a coherent and transparent set of val-
ues; each constituent mechanism should play a role appropriate to its place in 
the system; it should be recognised that the various mechanisms have differ-
ent functions and are governed by different basic principles, and they should 
not be twisted to perform foreign functions or to embrace alien principles; 
and there should be proportionality between the factors generating legal con-
sequences and the consequences they generate ( &raquo; more serious legal conse-
quences call for stricter prerequisites &laquo; )3.
</p>
<p>3. A fundamental difference exists between the protective mechanisms provided 
by private law and those provided by public law. The former should not be 
given public law tasks that are foreign to their nature. Private law is distinctive 
in being based on a structural principle of bilateral justification that requires a 
coincidence between the reasons for placing an obligation on one party and 
those underpinning the corresponding entitlement in the other. The princi-
ples of private law cannot be justified by reference merely to &raquo; one-sided &laquo; con-
siderations4.
</p>
<p>4. The law best performs its functions when it is constructed as a flexible system 
that recognises the divergent value of different goods and eschews clear-cut 
boundaries in favour of fluid transitions5.
</p>
<p>1 It is convenient to use this terminology notwithstanding the inexact fit between the English 
term &raquo; tort law &laquo; and the German &raquo; Schadenersatzrecht &laquo;. See Basic Questions I, v. Where neces-
sary, the text below will speak of &raquo; the law of damages &laquo; if this more accurately conveys the sub-
ject-matter addressed.

<p>These propositions set out a basic approach to tort law that would strike most 
English and Commonwealth lawyers as somewhat familiar, and would be enthusi-
astically endorsed by some &ndash; though emphatically denounced by others. It would 
be helpful at the beginning of this contribution to provide a preliminary indica-
tion of where &ndash; in England and the Commonwealth &ndash; the principal battlegrounds 
would be seen to lie.
</p>
<p>Tort as part of a comprehensive system for the protection of legal goods. Though 
I cannot now think of any account of tortious liability that subjects to such sus-
tained and rigorous analysis its place in the overall system for the protection of 
legal goods, I suspect that most English and Commonwealth lawyers would ac-
cept that it is helpful to view it in those terms, and one sees debates in particular 
contexts that set tort law against other protective mechanisms, including those of 
public law ( eg tort versus regulation, tort versus &raquo; no fault &laquo; ).
</p>
<p>The  consistency  of  the  overall  system. Though there are a few &raquo; critical &laquo; legal 
scholars who celebrate inconsistency in the law6, a substantial majority of Eng-
lish and Commonwealth lawyers would accept the desirability of what is often 
termed &raquo; coherence &laquo;. In recent decades, coherence in tort law has been a particu-
lar theme of the writings of the Canadian legal scholar Ernest Weinrib and those 
who might loosely be called his disciples7. However, even those who accept in 
principle that the law should be coherent in the senses described sometimes rec-
ognise restraints on what can be done to achieve it in a common law system: cer-
tain reforms may be considered to lie beyond the legitimate role of the judiciary 
and to be appropriate only for the legislator. As the legislator rarely finds political 
advantage in legislating in the field of tort law &ndash; and, when it does, cannot be re-
lied upon to enact a coherent reform &ndash; this becomes a source of considerable frus-
tration within the legal community.
</p>
<p>The  distinctiveness  of  private  law. Weinrib has also argued extensively in his 
writings that private law is distinctive because of its bilateral structure, and can-
not therefore coherently pursue &raquo; public &laquo; goals. These should be pursued, if at 
all, through alternative legal mechanisms. This view is also endorsed by others 
who nevertheless stop short of &raquo; buying into &laquo; the whole Weinrib package. However,

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>there is also a substantial body of opinion that holds that instrumental goals are 
legitimately pursued through private law. It is routine, for example, for policy con-
siderations to be taken into account in deciding whether, in a particular situation, 
a duty of care is owed by one person to another. Most of those who believe that 
this is legitimate would strenuously deny that they are conflating private law with 
public law.
</p>
<p>Flexibility versus certainty. On this point, there is likely to be more resistance 
to the thesis elaborated in &raquo; Basic Questions &laquo;. Since probably time immemorial, 
there has been a tension in the law between flexibility and certainty, and the na-
ture of common law systems &ndash; where the judge is the prime mover of legal devel-
opment, not the legislator &ndash; has meant that judges attach particular importance to 
certainty as they create, apply and develop &raquo; case law &laquo;. The doctrine of precedent 
( stare decisis ) is perhaps the most obvious product of this philosophy. But it has 
also been a particularly visible feature of the judicial development of the princi-
ples of tort law, in which it has often ( too often ? ) been accepted that a measure 
of arbitrariness is the necessary price of an overriding commitment to certainty.

<p>Part 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>I. Ownership and shifting of risk
</p>
<p>A basic implication of the ideas stated above provides Koziol&rsquo;s point of departure 
in &raquo; Basic Questions &laquo;: &raquo; If someone suffers damage, then in principle he must bear 
this damage himself &laquo;8. This, following Claus-Wilhelm Canaris, is ( &raquo; self-evidently &laquo; ) 
a &raquo; general risk of life &laquo;. From the perspective of private law, the conclusion seems 
to follow from the principle of bilateral justification because the mere suffering 
of loss by one person provides no reason in itself to oblige another person to bear 
its cost. Shifting the risk to someone else requires an independent justification 
directed at that other person. This attitude is encapsulated in the Latin maxim ca-
sum sentit dominus that Koziol cites in his opening sentence.
</p>
<p>Probably all legal systems take this as their starting point. The Latin phrase 
itself is perhaps not so familiar in English &ndash; a search of the Westlaw database 
of UK cases produced no hits at all &ndash; but, as Koziol notes, there is a well-known 
English equivalent: let the loss lie where it falls. This seems to be explicitly cited 
more often in connection with contracts than torts9, but it clearly has currency in 
the latter context too. The great American judge and jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes 
observed in his magnum opus &raquo; The Common Law &laquo; that &raquo; [ t ]he general principle 
of our law is that loss from accident must lie where it falls, and this principle is 
not affected by the fact that a human being is the instrument of misfortune &laquo;10. A 
more recent dictum teases out the idea a little further: &raquo; The starting point must 
be that prima facie a loss must lie where it falls. Sound and cogent reasons must 
be demonstrated for the common law to intervene by decreeing that the loss is to 
be borne by another person. And judges must take into account the fact that in a 
practical world the common law cannot spread its protection too widely. &laquo;11

</p>
<p>Broadly the same notion is encapsulated in a Latin phrase that does have 
broad currency in the common law world: damnum absque iniuria12. This expresses 
the idea that not all damage constitutes an injury for which the law will hold an-
other person accountable. See further no 5 / 117 ff below.
</p>
<p>Needless to say, English lawyers are also familiar with the &raquo; land of milk and 
honey &laquo; delusions that Koziol bemoans in his opening pages13. Thus, one senior 
judge expressly criticised the tendency to assume &raquo; that for every mischance in an 
accident-prone world someone solvent must be liable in damages &laquo;14. And, in simi-
lar vein, the courts have been urged &raquo; not [ to ] contribute to the creation of a soci-
ety bent on litigation, which is premised on the illusion that for every misfortune 
there is a remedy &laquo;15. In judicial dicta and the general public discourse there has 
been considerable emphasis on the adverse effects for society of what is popularly 
derided as a &raquo; compensation culture &laquo;. Encapsulating such concerns, it has been 
said that &raquo; [ t ]he fear is that, instead of learning to cope with the inevitable irrita-
tions and misfortunes of life, people will look to others to compensate them for all 
their woes, and those others will then become unduly defensive or protective &laquo;16. At 
the same time, anxiety has been expressed at the restrictions on personal auton-
omy that result from the over-extension of tort law, not just but also for potential 
victims, whose choices of action may be limited if those facing the threat of liabil-
ity respond in a detrimentally defensive fashion. 
</p>
<p>These various concerns have produced substantial legislative reform of tort 
law in Australia17, inspired by the tort reform movement in the USA, as well as a 
rather cosmetic statutory reform in the UK18. The need for such reforms has at-
tracted general academic scepticism19, though not because academics believe that

<p>361Part 1&emsp; &emsp; Introduction
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>the law should compensate for every loss that is suffered; rather, there is a widely-
shared perception that the public hostility directed towards the tort system can 
result in reforms that deform fundamental principles of justice and prevent the 
payment of compensation to injured persons even where there are good reasons 
for holding another person liable for it.
</p>
<p>II. Tort law&rsquo;s place in the overall system
</p>
<p>More fundamentally, there has long been scepticism that tort law is able to meet 
the various demands that modern society places on it, and this has led to the 
introduction of various alternative mechanisms in an effort to address societal 
needs better, sometimes curtailing remedies that would otherwise be available 
under the law of tort20.
</p>
<p>A. Workers&rsquo; compensation21
</p>
<p>No-fault workers&rsquo; compensation was introduced in Britain by the Workmen&rsquo;s 
Compensation Act 1897, and the example was soon followed in New Zealand and 
South Australia ( 1900 ), with other Australian states and territories following af-
terwards. The first Canadian province to introduce workers&rsquo; compensation was 
Ontario in 1915, and all the major provinces had it by 1931. The relationship of 
the new schemes with existing private law remedies took different forms. In the 
United Kingdom, the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act placed no limits on the work-
er&rsquo;s right to litigate in tort. It was still possible to sue the employer for a work-re-
lated injury and recover damages in the law of tort. By contrast, tort claims against 
the employer were abolished in Australia in some states, retained with restricted 
access in others, and retained with unlimited access in a final group of states. Re-
strictions on the right to sue in tort have taken various forms, including caps on 
the damages recoverable and minimum thresholds, expressed either in financial 
or percentage-disability terms, with the restrictions applying either to the whole 
claim or specifically to economic or non-economic losses. Depending on time and

</p>
<p>place, the injured person might be required to make an irrevocable election to 
pursue one claim rather than the other, with a decision to sue in tort entailing the 
loss of workers&rsquo; compensation rights, or could be allowed to pursue both concur-
rently until the actual award of damages in tort.
</p>
<p>Workers&rsquo; compensation no longer maintains a distinct institutional iden-
tity in Britain or New Zealand &ndash; in contrast with Australia and Canada. In Britain, 
workers&rsquo; compensation was subsumed within general social welfare provision in 
the immediate post-war years, becoming the Industrial Injuries Scheme ( IIS )22. IIS 
is very much a watered-down form of workers&rsquo; compensation, with benefits paid 
at fixed rates rather than related to actual pre-accident earnings. By 1990 ( when 
the link with pre-accident earnings was broken ) IIS had been substantially inte-
grated into the ordinary social security system, though the benefits paid are dis-
tinct from those paid in respect of non-work-related ill-health.
</p>
<p>In New Zealand, workers&rsquo; compensation was superseded by the comprehen-
sive Accident Compensation Scheme that was established in 1974. See no 5 / 22 ff 
below.
</p>
<p>B. Social welfare provision
</p>
<p>The British social welfare system was introduced in the years following the Sec-
ond World War. It offers a variety of forms of social security &ndash; including sick pay, 
incapacity benefit and unemployment benefit &ndash; as well as free access to the Na-
tional Health Service ( NHS ) for all. Initially, there was only incomplete deduction 
of the value of social security benefits from tort damages recovered in respect of 
the same injury, meaning that there was an element of double compensation in 
the sums received by the claimant, but since 1989 a statutory recoupment regime 
has applied, allowing the State to &raquo; claw back &laquo; the value of social security ben-
efits paid in respect of the same injury. This operates by way of a deduction from 
the damages paid to the claimant rather than as an independent recourse action 
against the defendant23. The deduction is made only from heads of damage cor-
responding to the loss compensated by the social security benefit, which means 
that damages for pain and suffering &ndash; for which there is no corresponding social 
security benefit &ndash; are effectively ring-fenced. For a long time, there was only very 
limited provision for the recoupment of NHS costs in treating the injured person, 
but from 2007 the statutory recoupment scheme was extended to allow the Depart-

<p>ment of Health to recover the relevant NHS charges ( including the charge for the 
provision of ambulance services )24.
</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that the social security system constitutes a better basis 
for the compensation of personal injuries than tort law, and recommend that the 
tort claims should be curtailed to allow exclusive reliance on social security25, but 
the value of social security benefits are much too low at present to allow one to 
conclude that this would be an adequate trade-off, and there is no public enthu-
siasm for the tax rises that would be necessary to support higher levels of benefit.
</p>
<p>C. Targeted no-fault
</p>
<p>As neither tort law nor social security appeared to offer an adequate response to 
the social problem of accidental injury, the focus of reform efforts shifted to the 
introduction of insurance-based no-fault compensation schemes in particular ar-
eas. In the UK, the main example is criminal injuries compensation, which was 
first introduced in 196426. Until 2001, awards were assessed in accordance with the 
rules of assessment for common law damages, but since then there has been a 
statutory &raquo; tariff &laquo; of 25 different levels of compensation, the maximum tariff pay-
able being &pound; 250,000. Loss of earnings ( beyond the first 28 weeks ) and &raquo; special ex-
penses &laquo; may also be compensated under the scheme; until 2012, the rules for cal-
culating these awards are similar to though less generous than those at common 
law, but since 2012 loss of earnings has been compensated on a flat-rate basis at a 
level equivalent to social security benefit ( statutory sick pay ). The maximum to-
tal amount payable in respect of a single injury is &pound; 500,00027. Though it has been 
suggested that the creation of a State fund was justified on grounds of the State&rsquo;s 
responsibility for failing to protect its citizens against crime, combined with its 
curtailment of individual rights of self-protection, these arguments were labelled 
&raquo; fallacious and dangerous &laquo; by the working party whose report paved the way for 
the scheme&rsquo;s introduction28. Its justification for the reform was simply sympathy 
for the victim, coupled with recognition of the inadequacy of benefits provided by 
the social security system.

</p>
<p>It has also been proposed that the UK should create a special no-fault com-
pensation scheme for personal injuries caused by road traffic accidents, but no 
legislation with that effect has been forthcoming. In Canada, by contrast, the first 
no-fault automobile accident scheme was introduced in Saskatchewan in 1946, fol-
lowed some time later in certain other provinces29. Some Australian states have 
also introduced auto no-fault30.
</p>
<p>No-fault compensation for medical injuries has also been proposed from time 
to time, but also without tangible result. For example, a Department of Health 
consultation paper in 2003 found that there was a case for no-fault compensa-
tion to be paid in respect of birth injuries resulting in severe neurological impair-
ment31, but this was not taken up in the subsequent Act that implemented other 
recommendations from the consultation paper32.
</p>
<p>D. Universal no-fault
</p>
<p>A possible model for a more thorough-going reform is provided by New Zealand&rsquo;s 
no-fault accident compensation scheme, introduced in 1974. This implemented 
the proposals of an iconic official report by the judge Sir Owen Woodhouse33. Wood-
house found that &raquo; [ t ]he negligence action is a form of lottery &laquo; and criticised the 
overall compensation system &ndash; also including workers&rsquo; compensation and social 
security &ndash; of which it was part: &raquo; Such a fragmented and capricious response to a so-
cial problem which cries out for co-ordinated and comprehensive treatment cannot 
be good enough. &laquo;34 The report proposed &raquo; two fundamental principles &laquo;: &raquo; First, no 
satisfactory system of injury insurance can be organised except on a basis of com-
munity responsibility; Second, wisdom, logic, and justice all require that every cit-
izen who is injured must be included, and equal losses must be given equal treat-
ment. There must be comprehensive entitlement &laquo; 35.
</p>
<p>Further aspects of the framework proposed were a commitment to complete 
rehabilitation and real ( though not &raquo; full &laquo; ) compensation, and recognition of the 
need for administrative efficiency.

<p>365Part 1&emsp; &emsp; Introduction
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>The Accident Compensation Scheme came into operation in 1974, enacting 
the majority of the Woodhouse proposals. Its basic components may be summa-
rised as follows36:
</p>
<p> ▷ Cover under the scheme attaches to various specified categories of personal 
injury, including personal injury caused by an accident, work-related diseases, 
infections and processes, and medical treatment injuries. It is immaterial 
whether the injury was caused by another person&rsquo;s fault. There are specific ex-
clusions from the scheme in respect of illnesses and infections &ndash; except if work-
related, or the result of treatment injury &ndash; and the consequences of ageing.
</p>
<p> ▷ The compensation provided is &raquo; real &laquo; but not &raquo; full &laquo;. It covers both economic 
and non-economic losses, and includes, where appropriate, weekly compen-
sation, paid at 80 % of pre-accident earnings, up to a fixed maximum of ap-
proximately 2.5 times average weekly income for those in paid employment, 
lump-sum compensation for non-economic loss, paid in respect of perma-
nent impairment assessed at 10 % or greater, at levels ranging between $ 2,500 
and $ 100,000, and medical and rehabilitation expenses, including public 
healthcare fees and expenses such as the cost of home or vehicle adjustments, 
care assistance in the home, and the provision of a wheelchair.
</p>
<p> ▷ The scheme is funded by levies on employers, the self-employed, motor vehi-
cle licence-holders, and, since 1992, by employees ( &raquo; earners &laquo; ) too. A propor-
tion of excise on petrol is also applied to the scheme, and there is additionally 
a measure of public subvention from general taxation.
</p>
<p> ▷ Where cover exists under the scheme, civil litigation for compensatory dam-
ages in respect of the same injury is barred.
</p>
<p>A brochure published in 2004 to mark 30 years of the scheme described it as  
&raquo; [ t ]he most rational and the most humane compensation law in the world &laquo;37. Not-
withstanding occasional grumblings about its operation in certain contexts, the 
scheme&rsquo;s basic principles have a large measure of support within the country38. 
Nevertheless, a number of ( mainly foreign ) scholars have subjected it to criti-
cism39. First, it is argued that it is unfair to limit the compensation paid to those 
injured by fault below the levels that would be awarded in a successful civil action  
for compensatory damages40. Corrective justice, it is said, requires full compensa-

<p>tion for losses attributable to the wrong. The principle undoubtedly has intuitive 
appeal, but does the tort system really achieve corrective justice in the imagined 
sense ? To Woodhouse, it did not. Legal fault ( the failure to attain the standard of 
the reasonable person ) is &raquo; a legal fiction &laquo;, and certainly does not connote moral 
culpability41. It is, in addition, an insubstantial basis for distinguishing between 
injury attracting full compensation and injury which left the victim to look for col-
lateral sources of support. The negligence action is, in effect, &raquo; a form of lottery &laquo;42. 
In any case, the tortfeasor is almost always insulated from the direct cost of liabil-
ity by insurance. Is it possible, then, to maintain ( or restore ) previously existing 
rights of action for victims of fault alongside the no-fault compensation entitle-
ments extended to all suffering accidental personal injury ? This has been sug-
gested from time to time by commentators43, but the New Zealand Law Commis-
sion has expressed its scepticism: &raquo; [ a ] supplementary tort liability scheme could 
duplicate the costs of compensating injury &laquo;44. In fact, the Woodhouse vision was 
explicitly premised on a costs calculation that the finances devoted to existing 
compensation systems ( tort, workers&rsquo; compensation and criminal injuries com-
pensation ) would be redeployed to the new no-fault scheme.
</p>
<p>A second criticism is that a no-fault compensation scheme cannot deter care-
less conduct, and, if its introduction is accompanied by the abolition of the deter-
rent of an action for damages in tort, must inevitably promote an increase in acci-
dent rates45. The evidence, it has to be said, is inconclusive. That cited in support 
of the criticism has relied excessively upon anecdote and personal observation46. 
On the other side of the argument, it has been shown that the available statistical 
evidence gives no reason to believe that the introduction of no-fault has increased 
accident rates47. It must also be remembered that the scheme has had available to

</p>
<p>it a number of tools that it can employ to duplicate &ndash; at least to some extent &ndash; such 
incentive effect as tort possesses, for example, the experience-rating of levies and 
the variation of levies following audit of safety management practices48. 
</p>
<p>Finally, the no-fault scheme has been criticised as an undue burden on state 
expenditure and the public at large49. It is true that the scheme has on occasion 
experienced financial difficulties, but these seem to have been attributable not to 
any intrinsic lack of viability in the fundamental vision, but rather to specific fail-
ures in the implementation. 
</p>
<p>Against these criticisms &ndash; even if one accepts that they have some validity &ndash; 
must be weighed what may be considered to be the scheme&rsquo;s three principal 
achievements. First, it extends compensation entitlements beyond the class of 
those injured by another person&rsquo;s fault, and so makes the receipt of compensa-
tion following an accident less of a lottery than it inevitably is under tort ( which 
compensates only a very small minority of accident victims, maybe as few as the 
6.5 % estimated by a Royal Commission in the United Kingdom )50. Secondly, the 
resources necessary to achieve this more complete coverage are much more effi-
ciently deployed than they would be in the tort litigation system. While the operat-
ing costs of the tort system ( in the UK ) have been calculated at 85 % of the value of 
total damages awards51, the comparable figure under the New Zealand scheme is 
only 12 % ( ie for every dollar paid on compensation or rehabilitation, only 12 cents 
is paid on overheads )52. Lastly, the no-fault scheme explicitly acknowledges com-
munity responsibility for both the production of accidental injury and its redress. 
Accidents are the inevitable by-product of activities which the community encour-
ages, and from which the community as a whole benefits, and so the community 
bears causal responsibility for their occurrence53. 
</p>
<p>48 For the latter, see Accident Compensation Act 2001, sec 175 and Accident Compensation ( Em-
ployer Levy ) Regulations 2004 ( SR 2004 / 23 ). Experience rating of employers was introduced in 
1992 but not restored after a short experiment with privatization in 1999-2000. An earlier system 
of safety incentive bonuses was abandoned in the 1980s because it could not be shown that it 
contributed to improved accident prevention.
</p>
<p>49 See eg P.S. Atiyah, The Damages Lottery ( 1997 ) 183-4 ( adding that such state schemes also pro-
mote an undesirable &raquo; blame culture &laquo; ). In this book, Atiyah, previously a proponent of no-fault 
( see especially his book Accidents, Compensation and the Law, first published in 1969 but now 
edited by P. Cane [ 7th edn 2006 ] ), declared his preference for first-party insurance as the solu-
tion to the social problem of accidental injury.

<p>E. Private insurance
</p>
<p>A more radical proposal still is to abolish tortious liability for personal injury &ndash; 
and replace it with nothing, leaving private first-party insurance to fill the gap to 
the extent that individuals desire54. It is claimed that this would serve to avoid the 
excesses and deficiencies of the tort system, while allowing individuals to tailor 
the cover they purchase to their own needs. Though the main proponent of the 
idea is hugely respected for his work on compensation and liability for accidents, 
the proposal has attracted very little support55.
</p>
<p>III. Certainty versus flexibility
</p>
<p>The tension between certainty and flexibility is an enduring feature of tort law 
in common law, and perhaps all legal systems. Features of the law can be high-
lighted that illustrate both tendencies. On the one hand, one might mention the 
general acceptance that the indeterminate scope of a potential liability may be 
a good reason for denying the existence of a duty of care in a whole category of 
cases56, a toleration of &raquo; bright line &laquo; rules whose effects are to some extent arbi-
trary57, a preference for what is pragmatic over what is principled58, and the not 
infrequent rejection of innovation in the law on the grounds that it would lead to 
uncertainty59. On the other hand, one sees a more flexible approach in the accept-
ance of the apportionment of liability where there is contributory negligence60, 
the recognition ( within limits ) of proportional liability in cases of causal uncer-

<p>tainty61, the explicit weighing of policy considerations in deciding whether the 
scope of the duty of care should be extended beyond the limits established in pre-
vious cases62, and in many other specific features of tort law. At a deeper level, one 
might also say that, by allowing the award of exemplary damages, the common 
law recognises that there is a fluid transition between tort and criminal law63. Of 
course, this is an issue that has generated excited debate, with powerful contribu-
tions on both sides of the argument.
</p>
<p>Looking at the broader picture, Waddams64 has mounted a sustained attack 
on the idea that the complexity of Anglo-American private law can be success-
fully accommodated within a strictly-demarcated classificatory framework. As he 
notes, key developments in the law have often occurred when fundamental con-
cepts have operated cumulatively and in such a way as to preclude allocation of 
the legal issue to a single doctrinal category. However, the &raquo; pigeonholing &laquo; ten-
dency that writers like Waddams criticise probably remains the dominant attitude 
of the courts.

<p>Part 2  The law of damages within the system for the 
protection of rights and legal interests 
</p>
<p>I. In general
</p>
<p>A. The basic idea
</p>
<p>One of Koziol&rsquo;s fundamental ideas is that the law of damages must be seen as part 
of a comprehensive system for the protection of &raquo; legal goods &laquo; ( rights and legal in-
terests )65. The constituent elements of this overall system involve consequences 
that are more or less onerous for the defendant, and, in the interests of internal 
consistency, ought to be ordered in such a way that the triggering conditions for 
each are proportionate to the consequences that flow from them. 
</p>
<p>B. Applicability of the basic idea to English and Commonwealth law
</p>
<p>It seems to me that this basic idea is intuitively attractive and could well be ac-
cepted by common lawyers in the English and Commonwealth legal traditions. 
One finds also that current law also adopts, at least approximately, the sort of 
scheme that Koziol seems to have in mind &ndash; perhaps most obviously in the more 
stringent conditions of liability applied in criminal law than in civil law, and the 
former&rsquo;s higher standard of proof ( see no 5 / 52 below ). Admittedly, some aspects of 
Koziol&rsquo;s account would strike common lawyers as alien ( eg the treatment of injunc-
tions as separate from the liabilities for which, in English law, they would be re-
garded as remedies ), but I do not think that this undermines the basic argument.
</p>
<p>Some short notes about some of the specific protective mechanisms follow.
</p>
<p>II. Recovery of property
</p>
<p>A. Introductory remarks
It may be surprising to an external observer that tort  law is English law&rsquo;s main 
mechanism for restoring property when possession is lost, and excluding others

<p>371Part 2&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;law&emsp;of&emsp;damages&emsp;within&emsp;the&emsp;system

</p>
<p>from it. In the past &ndash; prior to development of the land register &ndash; it also acted as a 
mechanism for deciding ownership of property. These propositions apply to both 
real and personal property, and pari passu to rights in the person. 
</p>
<p>B. Recovery of land
</p>
<p>A possessor may exclude others through the tort of trespass to land and regain 
possession of it if lost through the action for recovery of land &ndash; which is the mod-
ern form of the tort of ejectment, itself a form of liability in trespass. The claim is 
also known as a possession claim, and a streamlined procedure applies66. The ac-
tion protects both title to or estate in the land and possession of it.
</p>
<p>C. Recovery of chattels
</p>
<p>The common law failed to develop distinctively proprietary remedies for the re-
covery of goods67. At common law, damages were the only remedy for conversion, 
which was a purely personal action and judgment did not entitle the plaintiff to 
the assistance of the court in recovering possession68. The erstwhile &raquo; tort of deti-
nue &laquo; was different: &raquo; A successful action in detinue resulted in a judgment for deliv-
ery of the chattel or payment of its value as assessed, and for payment of damages 
for its detention. This, in effect, gave the defendant an option whether to return 
the chattel or to pay its value, and if the plaintiff wished to insist on specific restitu-
tion of the chattel he had to have recourse to Chancery &laquo;69. It was only the Common 
Law Procedure Act 1854, sec 78, that gave the court power to order delivery of the 
chattel by the defendant without giving him the option to pay its value as assessed. 
</p>
<p>The remedy previously available only in detinue was extended by statute to 
wrongful detention of all sorts in 1977; at the same time, detinue was abolished 
as a separate tort and effectively absorbed into an expanded law of conversion. 
Where goods have been detained in circumstances amounting to a wrongful inter-
ference with them contrary to Torts ( Interference with Goods ) Act 1977, the court 
may, at its discretion, make an order for delivery of the goods by the defendant

</p>
<p>to the claimant70. This means that the availability of an order for the delivery of 
goods is conditional on a liability established in tort ( conversion ). In this respect, 
English law may be contrasted with its continental neighbours where the claim for 
delivery ( vindicatio ) is independent of tortious liability.
</p>
<p>Adopting a tort-based approach to the recovery of chattels has the conse-
quence that a fault-free defendant through whose hands the property has passed, 
but who no longer has possession of it, may be liable to the claimant for its value 
as well as any consequential loss. The classic example is Fowler v. Hollins71. A rogue 
fraudulently obtained some cotton from Fowler. Hollins, whose ordinary business 
was that of a cotton broker, bought the cotton from the rogue in the belief that one 
of his ordinary clients would buy it and subsequently sold the client the cotton; 
Hollins received only a broker&rsquo;s commission on the sale. Although Hollins had no 
knowledge of the fraud, he was held liable in conversion. He had made himself a 
principal on the sale and had transferred the cotton to his client, an act which was 
inconsistent with the rights of the owner72. Because of the harshness of this rule, 
the courts have been driven to limit or recognise exceptions to the liability so as 
to protect the fault-free dealer. For example, an auctioneer who accepts goods for 
sale at auction and then returns them unsold to the person who supplied them, 
who turns out to be a rogue, is not liable in conversion to the person truly entitled 
to possession73.
</p>
<p>III. Injunctions74
</p>
<p>By sec 37( 1 ) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, &raquo; [ t ]he High Court may by order ( whether 
interlocutory or final ) grant an injunction &hellip; in all cases in which it appears to the 
court to be just and convenient to do so &laquo;75. In general, the exercise of this power 
presupposes the existence of an actual or potential claim for substantive relief 
which the court has jurisdiction to grant76 and the dominant modern view is that 
the power of the court is restricted to this and certain other exclusive categories77.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>In Spain v. Christie, Manson &amp; Woods Ltd.78, Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson V-C ad-
vanced the wider proposition that there is &raquo; a general jurisdiction to restrain by 
injunction deliberate acts which either did or were calculated to cause damage to 
the plaintiff &laquo;. But this runs counter to longstanding and binding authority &ndash; &raquo; an 
allegation of damage alone will not do. You must have in our law injury as well as 
damage &laquo;79 &ndash; and has been regarded as unsustainable80. 
</p>
<p>In general, an injunction may be granted whenever a tort has been commit-
ted81, provided that there is a risk that it may be continued or repeated, but it will 
be refused if there is no ground to apprehend its continuation or repetition82. If 
the commission of a tort is anticipated but has not yet occurred, a quia timet in-
junction may be awarded to prevent its commission83. It should be noted, however, 
that injunctions are a discretionary remedy and are not available as of right sim-
ply because a tort has been or will be committed84. Generally, no injunction will 
be granted where damages are an adequate remedy, or where the claimant acqui-
esced in the defendant&rsquo;s infringement of his legal rights, or delays excessively be-
fore seeking an injunction, or has &raquo; dirty hands &laquo;85. If the court concludes that the 
award of an injunction is inappropriate, it may choose to award damages in lieu86.
</p>
<p>Injunctions can be either positive or negative in form: either they make it 
mandatory for the defendant to perform some specified action ( a mandatory in-
junction ) or prohibit him from doing so ( a prohibitory injunction ). Because a 
mandatory injunction imposes a positive obligation, and is generally more dras-
tic in its effect than a prohibitory injunction, the jurisdiction to make such an 
award is &raquo; to be exercised sparingly and with caution &laquo;87. There are four governing 
propositions: the plaintiff must show a very strong probability that grave damage 
will accrue to him in the future; damages will not be a sufficient or adequate rem-
edy if some damage does accrue; the possible damage to the plaintiff must be bal-
anced against the cost to the defendant of doing works to prevent its occurrence 
or lessen its likelihood; and the terms of the injunction must be stated clearly so 
that the defendant is made aware of precisely what he has to do88.

</p>
<p>A person may excuse the use of force against the person or property of another by 
raising a defence of self-defence or necessity. Likewise, an owner or person enti-
tled to the immediate possession of land may use force to eject a trespasser, pro-
vided the force used is reasonable89. By an Act of 2003, however, a more lenient test 
of whether the act was &raquo; grossly disproportionate &laquo; now applies where the defend-
ant acted only because he believed it was necessary to do so to recover property90. 
Additionally, the remedy of abatement is available in respect of a nuisance or tres-
pass by encroachment &ndash; for example, by trimming the overhanging branches of 
a neighbour&rsquo;s tree or by entering neighbouring land to remove the trouble at 
source, so long as this can be done peaceably and without causing disproportion-
ate hardship. As a general rule, the abator should give notice before entering for 
this purpose. There is no right to abatement where the injured party has previ-
ously brought an unsuccessful action for a mandatory injunction to remove the 
offending object . Because victims of a nuisance or trespass generally ought not to 
take the law into their own hands, the right of abatement is subject to significant 
limitations and should be restricted to simple cases which would not justify the ex-
pense of legal proceedings and urgent cases which require an immediate remedy91.

<p>V. Unjust enrichment
</p>
<p>The law of restitution has developed rapidly in England and the Commonwealth 
in recent decades, with the development of general theories of unjust enrichment 
in place of what had previously been seen as a motley set of at best distantly re-
lated rules grouped under the headings quasi-contract and quasi-tort92. It is ac-
cepted that what are sometimes termed &raquo; restitutionary damages &laquo; are sometimes 
available in respect of the commission of a tort, though they are not a general rem-
edy in the law of tort. Indeed, whether they are ever a remedy for a tort as such &ndash; as 
opposed to an unjust enrichment that is coincidentally a tort &ndash; may be disputed93.

</p>
<p>In any case, it is clear that there can be an unjust enrichment without any element 
of tortious conduct &ndash; for example, the recipient of a mistaken payment is prima 
facie obliged to return its value even though not at fault or otherwise responsible 
for its receipt or retention.
</p>
<p>VI. Avoidance of contracts
</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s insolvency legislation contains specific provisions against debt avoid-
ance. Whether or not insolvency proceedings have been commenced, a company&rsquo;s 
transaction at an undervalue ( including a gift ) may be avoided if done for the pur-
pose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may at some 
time make, a claim against him, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a 
person in relation to such a claim. In such a case, the court may make such order 
as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the transac-
tion had not been entered into, and protecting the interests of persons who are 
victims of the transaction94. For example, it may require any property transferred 
as part of the transaction to be vested in any person, either absolutely or for the 
benefit of the victims of the transaction or it may require payment to any person in 
respect of benefits received from the debtor of such sums as the court may direct95. 
The order may be made against any person, but may not prejudice any interest 
in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor and was ac-
quired in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances96. 
It follows that the person receiving the property from the debtor may be subject to 
such order even if acting in good faith, providing value, and lacking notice of the 
relevant circumstances. Such person can thus be ordered to give up property or 
make a payment even in circumstances in which ( eg for lack of fault ) no tortious 
liability would arise.

<p>VII. Damages
</p>
<p>Damages are the primary remedy for torts, breaches of contract and other com-
mon law wrongs. They may take the following forms: compensatory damages; 
restitutionary damages; exemplary ( or punitive ) damages; aggravated damages; 
nominal damages; and contemptuous damages.
</p>
<p>A. Compensatory damages
</p>
<p>Compensation is the principal aim of damages in all common law systems. The 
objective is sometimes expressed through the Latin phrase restitutio in integrum. 
The basic rule is that &raquo; compensation should as nearly as possible put the party 
who has suffered in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sus-
tained the wrong &laquo;97.
</p>
<p>B. Restitutionary damages
</p>
<p>These are considered under no 5 / 43 above.
</p>
<p>C. Exemplary ( or punitive ) damages
</p>
<p>Punitive or, as most prefer to call them, exemplary damages are recognised by 
English law but confined at common law to two established categories: oppressive, 
arbitrary or unconstitutional action by servants of the government, and wrong-
ful conduct by the defendant which has been calculated by him to make a profit 
for himself which may well exceed the compensation payable to the claimant98. It 
remains unclear whether exemplary damages are available in respect of all torts 
or only specific causes of action99. In some Commonwealth jurisdictions, a wider 
right to exemplary damages is recognised. 
</p>
<p>D. Aggravated damages 
</p>
<p>Aggravated damages are compensatory in purpose, but compensate for non-pe-
cuniary harm that does not fall under the normal heads of non-pecuniary loss100

</p>
<p>attributable to the tortious injury ( eg distress suffered as a result of a hostile cross-
examination at trial ). It has been observed that the distinction between basic and 
aggravated damages is necessary because the right to recover for intangible con-
sequences such as humiliation, injury to pride and dignity, as well as for the hurt 
caused by the spiteful, malicious, insulting or arrogant conduct of the defendant, 
attaches to some causes of action and not others101. However, aggravated damages 
have some features which make them appear punitive as they traditionally require 
that the defendant should be guilty of some exceptional misconduct. In 1997, the 
Law Commission recommended legislation to clarify the role of aggravated dam-
ages102, but the Government subsequently concluded that it is now sufficiently 
clear that the purpose of aggravated damages is compensatory and not punitive 
as to obviate the need for a statutory definition103.
</p>
<p>E. Nominal damages
</p>
<p>The award of nominal damages denotes that the claimant&rsquo;s rights have been in-
fringed by the defendant&rsquo;s tortious conduct even though the claimant has suffered 
no loss as a consequence. Their practical relevance is thus in the areas of torts 
actionable per se. Though successful claimants are awarded no more than a few 
pounds, they will normally also obtain a costs order in their favour, even if ( for ex-
ample ) they fail in a concurrent attempt to gain an injunction. Additionally, the 
award performs the important function of vindicating the claimant&rsquo;s rights. There 
is no separate category of vindicatory damages. Though the making of a substan-
tial vindicatory award in cases of serious infringement of the claimant&rsquo;s right has 
been supported by some authorities104, it was comprehensively rejected by the Su-
preme Court in 2011105, with the approval of the majority of scholars106.

</p>
<p>F. Contemptuous damages
</p>
<p>If a court wishes to express contempt for the conduct of a claimant who has been 
successful on a legal technicality, it may assess the general damages in the amount 
of a contemptuous sum ( eg &pound; 1 ). In practice, such awards are limited to proceed-
ings in defamation, and they are often accompanied by an award of costs against 
the claimant, notwithstanding the usual &raquo; loser pays &laquo; rule107.
</p>
<p>VIII. Criminal liability
</p>
<p>Criminal liability exposes the offender to punitive sanctions which may include 
the loss of liberty. Their imposition may be discretionary or mandatory. As these 
consequences &ndash; and the stigma that arises from a conviction &ndash; are weightier than 
those resulting from incurring of civil liability, the conditions for its imposition 
are generally more stringent. For most offences against the person, as well as for 
criminal damage, the prosecution must demonstrate mens rea, meaning intention 
or recklessness as regards the specified consequence. Recklessness is construed 
as requiring conscious advertence to the risk, and is thus qualitatively different 
from negligence, not merely different in degree. Negligence is generally insuffi-
cient for the imposition of criminal liability, and even gross negligence is only suf-
ficient for certain offences ( though one of these is manslaughter ). The standard 
of proof in criminal trials is also more onerous than in civil cases: proof beyond 
reasonable doubt, rather than proof on the balance of probabilities.

<p>Part 3 The tasks of tort law
</p>
<p>I. Introductory remarks
</p>
<p>Tort law embodies the principle of corrective justice: one who wrongfully causes 
another harm should correct that injustice by the payment of compensation108. 
The author of one especially influential account of tort law in these terms, Wein-
rib, explains further: &raquo; The most striking feature about private law is that it directly 
connects two particular parties through the phenomenon of liability. Both proce-
dure and doctrine express this connection. Procedurally, litigation in private law 
takes the form of a claim that a particular plaintiff presses against a particular 
defendant. Doctrinally, requirements such as the causation of harm attest to the 
dependence of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim on a wrong suffered at the defendant&rsquo;s hands. 
In singling out the two parties and bringing them together in this way, private law 
looks neither to the litigants individually nor to the interests of the community as 
a whole, but to a bipolar relationship of liability. &laquo;109
</p>
<p>On Weinrib&rsquo;s account, &raquo; [ o ]nly if the plaintiff and defendant are linked in a 
single and coherent justificatory structure can one make sense of the practice 
of transferring resources directly from the defeated defendant to the victorious 
plaintiff &laquo;110. Consequently, tort law can perform a rational function only if it ab-
stains from all attempts to achieve instrumental goals, and tort lawyers should 
give up evaluating tort law in terms of such external ( social rather than legal ) goals 
and seek an &raquo; internal &laquo; understanding of the law in the notion of corrective justice. 
More specifically: tort law risks incoherence if it seeks to pursue &raquo; public &laquo; goals, 
for example, the &raquo; efficient &laquo; deterrence of accidents or the provision of accident 
compensation, because such goals are inconsistent with the bipartite nature of 
legal proceedings.
</p>
<p>Most courts and commentators, even if they accept Weinrib&rsquo;s starting points, 
would stop short of his final conclusion and his asceticism vis-&agrave;-vis the positing 
of goals, aims, tasks, functions, etc, of the law of tort. In fact, quite a number of 
objectives have been identified111, including the vindication of the rights112, denun-
ciation of the defendant&rsquo;s wrong, education of people generally as to proper stand-
</p>
<p>108 A recent attempt to analyse the English law of negligence in corrective justice terms may be 
found in Beever, Rediscovering the Law of Negligence.

</p>
<p>ards of conduct, and the peaceful settlement of disputes arising from the acciden-
tal infliction of injury ( &raquo; appeasement &laquo; )113. The two most often cited objectives of 
tort law, however, are compensation and deterrence.
</p>
<p>II. Compensation
</p>
<p>&raquo; Compensation &laquo; is frequently cited as an objective of the law of tort, but there 
is some slippage between two distinct conceptions: first, that tort law should be 
evaluated by its ability to compensate for all injuries; secondly, that tort law aims 
at compensation as part of a regime of corrective justice. The first is a normative 
claim and manifestly implausible: tort law cannot be expected to compensate for 
all injuries, and even if it could its costs would be far too great. The second is more 
of a descriptive claim: tort law &ndash; by compensating for harm done by A to B in cir-
cumstances where A is fairly accountable for it &ndash; corrects what would otherwise be 
an injustice. Nowadays, compensation is most often thought of in the latter terms, 
which evidently leaves open the crucial question of when, and for what harms, 
one person is fairly accountable in tort law to another. 
</p>
<p>III. Deterrence
</p>
<p>The deterrence function of tort law is said to have been first proposed in England 
by Jeremy Bentham ( 1748&ndash;1832 )114, but has achieved especial prominence through 
the writings of mainly American scholars who analyse tort law in economic terms 
and posit economic efficiency as its ultimate goal. Though many of the key in-
sights of the economic analysis of law were anticipated in the judicial and extra-
judicial writings of Baron Bramwell in the late nineteenth century115, modern law 
and economics has not gained much of a foothold amongst tort lawyers in Eng-
land or elsewhere in the Commonwealth. Deterrence is mostly viewed as a useful 
by-product of civil liability, rather than its overriding objective.

</p>
<p>IV. Punishment
</p>
<p>Viewed in historical terms, punishment is certainly not alien to tort. According to 
Sir Henry Maine, for example, &raquo; the penal law of ancient communities is not the law 
of crimes; it is the law of wrongs, or, to use the English technical word, of torts &laquo;116. 
Still, though &raquo; punitive &laquo; or &raquo; exemplary &laquo; damages may be awarded in England and 
certain Commonwealth jurisdictions in particular circumstances117, punishment 
as such is not nowadays considered the function of tort law. 
</p>
<p>V. Mixed accounts
</p>
<p>Probably most tort lawyers in England and the Commonwealth would say that 
tort law pursues a mixture of different tasks118, but there must be constraints on 
what it can do for reasons of fairness to the parties, as well as administrative ef-
ficiency. A particularly notable account of this nature has been provided by Tony 
Honor&eacute;   119. In his view, it is a mistake to search for a single justification ( eg com-
pensation or deterrence ) for the system as a whole, or even to think in terms of 
a compound aim for the system ( eg a mixture of compensation, deterrence and 
corrective justice ). That would be to run together questions that ought to be kept 
separate. For present purposes, it is enough to highlight just three: ( a ) what gen-
eral aims justify the state in maintaining a system of tort law ?; ( b ) what justifies 
the person whose rights have been infringed in claiming compensation from the 
wrongdoer ?; and ( c ) subject to what conditions may one who by his conduct has 
infringed the rights of another be required to pay compensation ? 
</p>
<p>A. General justifying aims
</p>
<p>On Honor&eacute;&rsquo;s account, the general justifying aims of tort law are to reduce the level 
of undesirable conduct by stamping it as wrongful ( though in a less stigmatic way 
than criminal law ), forbidding it or, at a minimum, warning those who indulge in 
it of the liability they may incur. To that extent, tort law can be seen as a means of 
social control. But at the same time, by creating torts rather than crimes, the law

</p>
<p>defines and gives content to people&rsquo;s rights by providing them with a mechanism 
for protecting them and securing compensation if their rights are infringed.
</p>
<p>B. Justifying the distribution of tortious liability
</p>
<p>In pursuing these general aims, however, the law should also develop principles 
which govern the &raquo; distribution &laquo; of tortious liability. Here, Honor&eacute; highlights cor-
rective justice ( the harm-doer&rsquo;s wrong must violate the harm-sufferer&rsquo;s right ); his 
own theory of &raquo; outcome responsibility &laquo;120 ( which assumes that the defendant is 
of full capacity and hence in a position to control his behaviour ); and distributive 
justice ( including the just distribution of risks, and the allocation of burdens in 
proportion to benefits ).
</p>
<p>C. Conditions for the imposition of tortious liability
</p>
<p>Yet even the principles of justice that dictate the prima facie distribution of tor-
tious liability must be tempered, for applied without limitation they may also pro-
duce injustice. For that reason, Honor&eacute; proposes that their application should be 
restricted by reference to retributive justice: the defendant ought not to be made 
to pay unless he has chosen to do what the law forbids, or otherwise acted with 
fault, except where insurance is available to lessen the burden on him, and any li-
ability imposed should be proportionate to the gravity of his conduct. The general 
exclusion of liability for unforeseeable consequences is one mechanism by which 
the law can effect a rough proportionality between conduct and liability, though 
the limitation of liability it supplies can be somewhat arbitrary.

<p>Part 4  The area between tort and breach of an 
obligation
</p>
<p>I. Introductory remarks
</p>
<p>It is certainly true that there are some civil wrongs that are hard to ascribe ex-
clusively to the law of tort as opposed to some other category of obligation. One 
example is provided by the law of bailment. At common law, the bailee of goods 
owes a duty to take reasonable care of the goods and to refrain from converting 
them. To that extent, any liability arising is concurrent with a liability in tort. But 
some of the bailee&rsquo;s obligations are incapable of being categorised as tortious 
or contractual in nature, for example, the strict obligation to compensate loss 
or damage resulting from the bailee&rsquo;s departure from the terms of the bailment, 
which applies even to an unrewarded bailee under a gratuitous bailment ( there 
being no contract by reason of a lack of consideration )121. That is a liability that 
may best be regarded as sui generis. Claims against an agent for breach of war-
ranty of authority may fall into this category, as well as claims for misrepresen-
tation. The obligations of common carriers and innkeepers should also be men-
tioned in this context.
</p>
<p>II.   Tort, breach of contract and the intermediate area
</p>
<p>Particular attention has been given to the intermediate area between tort and con-
tract &ndash; or &raquo; contorts &laquo; as one commentator has wryly called it122. In Hedley Byrne &amp; 
Co. v. Heller &amp; Partners Ltd.123, the House of Lords departed from the longstanding 
general exclusion of extra-contractual liability in respect of pure economic loss, 
and recognised in principle that liability might arise where one party voluntarily 
assumes responsibility to another in the context of a special relationship that is 
&raquo; equivalent to contract &laquo;. The new liability principle was considered to be a princi-
ple of the law of tort, but it was recognised that it stands apart from tort law as cus-
tomarily conceived. Amongst its distinguishing features are that it is based on an

<p>obligation that is voluntarily assumed by the defendant, rather than imposed by 
law in the way of tort obligations generally, that it requires a preexisting relation-
ship between the parties, and of course that the loss suffered is purely economic, 
which is generally the field of contract law rather than tort. Though the develop-
ment has mostly been viewed with favour, it is also recognised that it has the po-
tential to &raquo; short-circuit &laquo; the ordinary requirements applicable to the enforcement 
of contractual undertakings, for example, by giving the claimant the benefit of 
a gratuitous undertaking124, or of a contractual undertaking contained in a con-
tract to which the claimant was not privy and which is not directly enforceable by 
him125. Consequently, the further development of Hedley Byrne liability has been 
extremely cautious, especially in England.

ation is provided as a quid pro quo.

<p>Part 5 The basic criteria for a compensation claim 
</p>
<p>I. Damage
</p>
<p>There is no general concept of &raquo; damage &laquo; in English tort law, and academic discus-
sions of the topic have been few in number, but damage does play an important 
role in most torts recognised by English law. As there are, according to one esti-
mate, some 70 or more torts recognised by the common law126, it could be said 
that there are in fact 70 or more different conceptions of damage in English tort 
law. That is to overstate the case somewhat, but it gives some indication of the dif-
ficulty facing an English lawyer in this area. It by no means follows that what is 
recognised as damage in Tort A is so recognised in Tort B.
</p>
<p>Any account of damage in English law must start by noting the two principal 
&raquo; forms of action &laquo; recognised in the writ system that survived until 1875, namely, 
trespass and the action on the case ( or, more simply, &raquo; case &laquo; )127. Most of the mod-
ern English law of tort can be traced directly back to these two actions. For present 
purposes, the main point of distinction between the two actions is that trespass 
was actionable on proof of the specified interference ( to the person, to goods or to 
land ), even if the claimant suffered no damage, while, in case, damage was the gist 
of the cause of action. The three forms of trespass recognised under the writ sys-
tem &ndash; trespass to the person ( sub-divided into assault, battery and false imprison-
ment ), trespass to goods, and trespass to land &ndash; survive in modern English tort law. 
Case, by contrast, is no longer recognised as such, but a large number of modern-
day actions can be identified as its descendents, and follow it in requiring proof 
of damage. By far the most important of these descendents, both practically and 
conceptually, is the tort of negligence. Here, damage plays a crucial, if somewhat 
concealed, role in determining whether &ndash; as must be shown if liability is to be im-
posed &ndash; the defendant owed the claimant a duty of care. Here, the type of damage 
suffered by the claimant is given particular significance ( eg whether it is physical 
damage or pure economic loss or mental injury ). However, such classifications re-
ally go to the question of &raquo; scope of liability &laquo; rather than damage as such are so are 
considered further at no 5 / 141 ff.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>A. Torts actionable per se
</p>
<p>For certain torts, a cause of action may come into existence without proof of actual 
damage or loss128, and in such cases the prohibited infringement of the claimant&rsquo;s 
sphere itself is the tort. Nominal damages may be recovered and, in appropriate 
cases, an injunction may be granted; but, if damages are sought for particular loss, 
a causal connection between the tort and the alleged loss must be shown.
</p>
<p>B. Different types of damage: a hierarchy of protected interests
</p>
<p>Generally, one may say that the common law attaches more or less weight to par-
ticular types of damage in accordance with an implicit underlying hierarchy of 
protected interests. Interests in the person and in property are given the high-
est protection; personality interests ( with the exception of reputation ) and purely 
economic interests are given lesser protection. Thus there is no general tort of in-
vasion of privacy129, even though particular torts protect individual aspects of the 
right ( eg informational privacy )130.
</p>
<p>For some, this hierarchy of values is self-evident, but there have also been 
some interesting attempts to explain certain aspects of it. Thus, for example, Wit-
ting has sought to explain why purely economic losses are not generally recover-
able in the tort of negligence, while losses associated with damage to property 
are131. To this end, he develops what he terms a &raquo; personality thesis &laquo;: &raquo; whereas an 
individual&rsquo;s personality is partly constituted by the property that he or she owns, 
so that property can be seen as essential to the ways in which individuals consti-
tute and define themselves, no such claim can be made with respect to mere ab-
stract holdings of wealth &laquo;132. In the author&rsquo;s view, this consideration better justi-
fies the distinction the law makes between property damage and pure economic 
loss than other explanations that have been advanced, for example, that purely 
economic losses are difficult to prove or liable to be indeterminate in nature. It 
does not entail, however, that purely economic losses should never be recoverable 
in negligence.
</p>
<p>128 For example trespass to the person, trespass to goods and trespass to land, as well as libel and 
slanders actionable per se. Cf Watkins v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [ 2006 ] UKHL 
17, [ 2006 ] 2 AC 395, deciding that damage remains an element of the tort of misfeasance in pub-
lic office and that liability does not arise for invasion of a constitutional right per se.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>C. Damage in specific torts
</p>
<p>1. Public nuisance 
</p>
<p>Public nuisance has been defined as &raquo; an act not warranted by law or an omission 
to discharge a legal duty, which act or omission obstructs or causes inconvenience 
or damage to the public in the exercise of rights common to all Her Majesty&rsquo;s 
subjects &laquo;133. Ordinarily only a criminal offence, a public nuisance may give rise to 
civil liability if it causes the claimant to suffer some &raquo; special damage &laquo;, by which 
is meant damage different in kind &ndash; and not merely greater in amount &ndash; than that 
suffered by persons generally. 
</p>
<p>2. Private nuisance 
</p>
<p>A private nuisance is the unreasonable interference with the claimant&rsquo;s use or en-
joyment of land. As it is &raquo; a tort to land &laquo;, not a tort of general application, it is action-
able only by a person with an interest in the land affected134. But it is not necessary 
to show that the claimant suffered physical harm: interference with his amenity 
interests will suffice. But the interference must be substantial135. The bare invasion 
of the claimant&rsquo;s land by things emanating from the defendant&rsquo;s is also actionable, 
again even if no physical harm results, though in such a case the claimant may be 
restricted to nominal damages. In such a case, the likely reason for bringing a claim 
would be obtaining an injunction, though it should be noted that damages for fu-
ture losses may be awarded in lieu of an injunction if the claimant&rsquo;s loss is small, as-
sessable in money terms, adequately compensated by a small money payment, and 
it would be oppressive to the defendant to grant the injunction136.
</p>
<p>3. Defamation ( libel and slander )
</p>
<p>Defamation has always been thought of as a somewhat distinct tortious liability 
and adopts a rather curious distinction between libels ( defamations in perma-
nent form ), in respect of which damage is presumed, and slanders ( defamations 
in transient form ), in respect of which &raquo; special damage &laquo; must generally be proven. 
However, under the Defamation Act 1952, sec 3 it is provided that it is not nec-
essary to allege or prove special damage in the following cases: ( a ) if the words 
upon which the action is founded are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to

<p>the plaintiff and are published in writing or other permanent form; or ( b ) if the 
said words are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff in respect of 
any office, profession, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the 
time of publication. A claimant who relies on the section is not limited to nominal 
damages, as the purpose of the statutory provision was to give the claimant a rem-
edy despite the difficulty of proving actual loss, and this could not be achieved if 
a claim brought under it could lead only to an award of nominal damages137. Gen-
eral damages may therefore be awarded for future pecuniary loss likely to be suf-
fered by the claimant as a result of the slander.
</p>
<p>D. Primary and consequential damage
</p>
<p>There is no formal category of &raquo; consequential loss &laquo; in English tort law and no 
particular difficulty with the recovery of compensation for it. Thus, for example, a 
carpenter whose tools are taken away is entitled to damages not just for their value 
but also for any proven disruption of his trade as a consequence138. However, a 
number of writers have adopted consequential loss as a category for the purposes 
of exposition139. Moreover, in torts concerning damage to property, a distinction 
is drawn between the infringement of the claimant&rsquo;s property interest in itself, 
and losses consequential upon it. To the latter, a test of remoteness applies &ndash; and 
the ordinary rules of novus actus interveniens &ndash; but liability for the infringement 
itself appears not to be subject to the same requirements, as it is not negated or 
reduced by the intervention of unforeseen circumstances beyond the defendant&rsquo;s 
control140. Lastly, it may be noted in this context that there are some categories 
of case in which English law limits the ability of a &raquo; secondary &laquo; victim to recover 
damages for harm suffered in consequence of an injury suffered by, or threatened 
to, the &raquo; primary &laquo; victim &ndash; most notably where the secondary victim&rsquo;s injury is psy-
chiatric141. In such circumstances, the secondary victim is owed a duty of care only 
where there was a relationship of love and affection with the primary victim, and 
the secondary victim was at the scene of the accident or came upon its immediate 
aftermath142.

</p>
<p>E. Loss of profits
</p>
<p>Loss of profits is in principle recoverable in an action for negligence, but, when 
it is not consequential on physical damage to the claimant&rsquo;s property or person, 
it constitutes pure economic loss in respect of which no duty of care will gener-
ally arise143. It may be noted that it is the category &raquo; pure economic loss &laquo;, not the 
category &raquo; loss of profit &laquo; as such, to which significance is attached in English law.
</p>
<p>F. Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage
</p>
<p>The concepts &raquo; pecuniary loss &laquo; and &raquo; non-pecuniary loss &laquo; play a role mainly in the 
assessment of damages for personal injury. To an English lawyer it seems odd to 
treat these concepts as providing a categorisation of &raquo; damage &laquo; rather than &raquo; dam-
ages &laquo;: the question whether there is any damage at all is prior to the question of 
the pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses flowing from it. Be that as it may, there 
is no particular difficulty with the recovery of damages for non-pecuniary loss in 
English tort law. Indeed, it has been said that in tort, in contrast with the law of 
contract, &raquo; non-pecuniary losses flourish &laquo;144. The leading work on damages identi-
fies five heads of non-pecuniary loss: ( a ) pain and suffering and loss of amenities 
( PSLA ); ( b ) physical inconvenience and discomfort145; ( c ) social discredit ( mainly 
limited to claims in defamation ); ( d ) mental distress; and ( e ) loss of society of rel-
atives ( a statutory claim under Fatal Accidents Act 1976, sec 1A ). 
</p>
<p>1. PSLA
</p>
<p>Of the various forms of non-pecuniary loss, the most frequently encountered in 
practice is PSLA, which is one of the basic heads of damage where a tort results in 
physical injury to the claimant. The two components of the loss &ndash; pain and suffer-
ing, on the one hand, and loss of amenities on the other &ndash; are regarded as distinct, 
even though the practice is to award a single global sum encompassing both as-

144 McGregor, McGregor on Damages 18 &sect; 3-002.
145 Awards for physical inconvenience and discomfort are usually included in the award for pain, 
</p>
<p>suffering and loss of amenities, but this is not possible where there is no physical injury, and 
it is in such cases that physical inconvenience and discomfort forms a separate head of dam-
ages. See eg Mafo v. Adams [ 1970 ] 1 QB 548, CA ( deceit ). Contrary to the statement in McGregor, 
McGregor on Damages 18 &sect; 3-009, personal inconvenience and annoyance is not actionable 
damage in the tort of private nuisance as private nuisance is a tort to land, not a tort to the 
person: Hunter v. Canary Wharf Ltd. [ 1997 ] AC 655. Damages may, however, be awarded to the 
extent that the interference causing the inconvenience detrimentally affects the value of the 
claimant&rsquo;s land.

</p>
<p>pects146. Pain and suffering is assessed subjectively, reflecting the claimant&rsquo;s expe-
rience of pain and mental suffering, but loss of amenity is assessed objectively, re-
flecting the fact of the loss whether the claimant is aware of it or not147. This means 
that substantial damages may be awarded for loss of amenity even to a plaintiff who 
is unconscious148. Damages are designed to compensate for such results as have ac-
tually been caused. It follows, in principle, that a claimant&rsquo;s unconsciousness pre-
vents any monetary award for pain or consequential worry and anxiety as he would 
not have suffered any ( or so it is believed ). An unconscious person is spared pain 
and suffering and does not experience the mental anguish which may result from 
knowledge of the amenities he has lost or the shortening of his life. The fact of un-
consciousness does not, however, eliminate the actuality of the victim&rsquo;s loss of the 
amenities of life. As the two elements are combined in the award for general dam-
ages, the normal practice in such cases is for the court to refer to the normal tariff 
bracket for the injury in question, simply choosing a figure at the lower end of the 
bracket in cases where the pain and suffering component has to be reduced or elim-
inated because of the victim&rsquo;s unconsciousness149. It is, it should be noted, quite ir-
relevant what use will or might be made of the money awarded as compensation.
</p>
<p>2. Mental distress
</p>
<p>As the leading text observes, &raquo; [ m ]ental distress is not by itself sufficient damage to 
ground an action &hellip; However, once liability has been established, then in certain 
torts compensation for injury to feelings may be included in the damages &hellip; &laquo; 150. 
Torts where such awards are possible include assault and battery, defamation, de-
ceit and the statutory torts of sex, race and disability discrimination151. Compensa-
tion for mental distress may also be awarded in respect of a wider range of torts &ndash; 
including torts to property &ndash; under the head of aggravated damages152. Torts where 
damages for mental distress may not be awarded include private nuisance153 and 
conspiracy154.

<p>391Part 5&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;basic&emsp;criteria&emsp;for&emsp;a&emsp;compensation&emsp;claim
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>Whether English common law, in any circumstances, recognises &raquo; freestand-
ing &laquo; distress as damage &ndash; as opposed to distress consequential on other, recog-
nised injury &ndash; is an interesting question. It has been argued that there should be a 
liability where the infliction of distress is intentional, relying on the famous case 
of Wilkinson v. Downton155. There the defendant, as a practical joke, told the plain-
tiff that her husband had been seriously injured in a road accident. She suffered 
serious and permanent physical consequences as a result and sued for damages. 
Allowing her claim, Wright J stated the rule to be applied as follows &raquo; The defend-
ant has, as I assume for the moment, wilfully done an act calculated to cause 
physical harm to the plaintiff &ndash; that is to say, to infringe her legal right to personal 
safety, and has in fact thereby caused physical harm to her. That proposition with-
out more appears to me to state a good cause of action, there being no justifica-
tion alleged for the act &laquo;156.
</p>
<p>However, that was a case of &raquo; nervous shock &laquo; resulting in physical harm, not 
mere distress, so it is not strictly in point. Nevertheless, judicial dicta recognise 
that there is an argument for treating the intention to cause harm as sufficient 
to justify a departure from the normal requirement that there should be physi-
cal harm or at least a recognised psychiatric condition, provided the intention 
element is narrowly defined157, though this was explicitly rejected when the issue 
came before the Court of Appeal in 2001158.
</p>
<p>Freestanding distress may, however, be actionable damage under statute: if 
harassment, alarm or distress is caused by &raquo; a course of conduct &laquo;, there may be 
a statutory remedy in damages under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 
( whether or not the effect on the victim was intended )159.
</p>
<p>G. Non-pecuniary loss and legal persons160
</p>
<p>English law does not formally exclude the possibility of awarding damages for 
non-pecuniary loss to a legal person. Admittedly, a corporation cannot suffer 
&raquo; pain &laquo; or &raquo; distress &laquo; as such161, but it is accepted that it may suffer &raquo; social dis-
credit &laquo;. Consequently, it has long been recognised that a trading corporation can

<p>recover damages for its loss of reputation. Though sec 1 of the Defamation Act 
2013 now restricts liability to situations where the reputational harm has caused 
or is likely to cause the corporation serious financial loss, this does alter the basis 
on which damages for defamation should be assessed. The good name of a com-
pany is a thing of value and there is no good reason why the law should not protect 
it162. However, this very formulation &ndash; even if not all &raquo; value &laquo; is economic &ndash; raises 
the question whether the interest a corporation has in its reputation can really 
be classified as non-pecuniary interest; indeed, it has been argued that it cannot, 
and for that reason that it should not be protected by the law of defamation163. In 
any case, by way of exception to the general rule that legal persons can sue for 
injury to their reputation, democratically elected organs of government ( includ-
ing local authority corporations ) have no right to maintain an action of damages 
for defamation164. Additionally, although a trade union has quasi-corporate status 
and is capable of suing in tort in its own name165, its lack of true legal personal-
ity precludes it bringing an action in defamation: it does not have a separate legal 
personality capable of being defamed166. One may say, therefore, that there is no 
decisive evidence that English law does in fact award damages for non-pecuniary 
loss suffered by legal persons.
</p>
<p>H. Loss of the enjoyment of a holiday
</p>
<p>Loss of the enjoyment of a holiday is compensable damage &ndash; at least when it re-
sults from personal injury167 or some other independently actionable harm. It has 
generally been assumed that the lost enjoyment of a holiday is not actionable in 
the absence of independently actionable harm168. Where compensation is awarded, 
it is normally under the heading of general damages ( ie as non-pecuniary loss )169.

</p>
<p>I. Loss of the use of property
</p>
<p>The claimant is entitled to damages for &raquo; loss of use &laquo; of a damaged chattel even if 
he is able to call upon the services of a substitute that has been kept in reserve. In 
the leading case170, the Earl of Halsbury put the following example: &raquo; Supposing a 
person took away a chair out of my room and kept it for twelve months, could any-
body say you had a right to diminish the damages by shewing that I did not usually 
sit in that chair, or that there were plenty of other chairs in the room ? The propo-
sition so nakedly stated appears to me to be absurd &hellip; &laquo;. Whether the law actually 
goes so far may, however, be doubted. In Alexander v. Rolls Royce Motor Cars171, the 
Court of Appeal declined to award damages for loss of use in a case of damage to a 
private motor car of which the plaintiff made little and only intermittent use. The 
true principle appears to be that damages for loss of use are available only where 
financial loss or inconvenience can be assumed, or where the claimant has in-
curred expense in maintaining a substitute chattel for use in the event of damage 
to that which is normally in use.
</p>
<p>In shipping cases, it has been usual to award a sum equivalent to interest pay-
able on the vessel&rsquo;s depreciated capital value during the period for which it was 
out of use172, but this may not be appropriate where the damaged property is liable 
to depreciate rapidly in value. This could lead to considerable inconsistency in 
the quantum of awards depending upon the age of the property in question. Thus, 
where a city corporation lost the use of one of its buses for 69 days as the result 
of a collision caused by the negligence of another driver, but used one of the re-
serve buses it maintained for emergencies while the damaged vehicle underwent 
repairs, they were deprived of a valuable chattel and entitled to substantial dam-
ages calculated by reference to the daily cost of maintaining a bus in the reserve 
fleet173. This could be considered to produce a sum roughly equivalent to the chat-
tel&rsquo;s value to its owners, and had the merit of providing a reasonably stable basis 
for calculation that was as fair as possible to each side. The risk of this approach 
is that it can be seen to put &raquo; a premium upon inefficiency &laquo;174 insofar as higher 
maintenance costs would lead to higher damages, but in the case of property that

<p>depreciates rapidly in value the advantages may be considered to outweigh the 
disadvantages. The analysis does not entail that the defendant&rsquo;s tort &raquo; caused &laquo; the 
plaintiff to spend money on maintaining a reserve bus: that expenditure was sim-
ply used as the best approximation of the loss the plaintiffs suffered by reason of 
the damaged bus being out of service.

<p>J. Wrongful conception, wrongful life and wrongful birth
</p>
<p>As in many other legal systems, English law has experienced great difficulties in 
recent decades in dealing with claims for wrongful conception, wrongful life and 
wrongful birth.
</p>
<p>1. Wrongful conception
</p>
<p>Wrongful conception indicates the situation where a woman has conceived a child 
through the tortious conduct of another person. The most common scenario is a 
negligently performed sterilisation operation, either on the woman herself or her 
partner. In such a case, the mother may recover damages for the ( pecuniary and 
non-pecuniary ) effects of the pregnancy and birth themselves, but not the eco-
nomic loss constituted by the costs of rearing the &raquo; unwanted &laquo; child175. There has 
been some equivocation as to whether the economic loss is pure or consequential, 
not just as regards the father but also the mother, but it seems clear that this does 
not matter in this context176.
</p>
<p>To the damages recoverable by the mother in respect of the pregnancy and 
birth is to be added a conventional award in recognition of the injury to the par-
ents&rsquo; autonomy. &raquo; Conventional &laquo; here signifies that the award is independent of 
the actual effects on the parents of having an &raquo; unwanted &laquo; child, and is of fixed 
amount. It seems to be awarded in respect of a presumed non-pecuniary loss. The 
award may be regarded as compensatory177. The figure awarded ( &pound; 15,000178 ) may 
be compared with the smaller conventional sum of &pound; 11,800 that is awarded by stat-
ute to the parents of a child who is killed by another person&rsquo;s tort179. It seems that

</p>
<p>176 In McFarlane, Lord Steyn ( at [ 79 ] ) and Lord Hope ( at [ 96 ] ) considered the loss was purely eco-
nomic, and Lord Hope repeated this opinion in Rees ( at [ 52 ] ), but Lord Steyn ( McFarlane, at 
[ 79 ] ) and Lord Millett ( McFarlane, at [ 109 ] ) said that it was irrelevant whether the economic 
loss was pure or consequential.
</p>
<p>177 In the leading case, this was expressly the view of Lord Millett, but Lord Bingham &ndash; for reasons 
which are hard to fathom &ndash; stated it was not compensatory.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>the award is for the injury suffered by both parents, and it may be anticipated that 
difficult questions will arise as to who gets the money, and how much, if the par-
ents have separated at the time of the birth, or have never been &raquo; together &laquo; at all.
</p>
<p>The above principles apply not just in the case of a healthy child with healthy 
parents, but also where a healthy child is born to a disabled parent. It is yet to be 
finally resolved whether the same applies where it is the child&rsquo;s disability that ma-
terially increases the costs of care. The Court of Appeal has allowed recovery of the 
&raquo; additional &laquo; caring costs ( pecuniary damage ) in such a case180, but the correctness 
of that decision subsequently divided the House of Lords ( obiter )181 and to that ex-
tent remains open. 
</p>
<p>2. Wrongful life
</p>
<p>English law does not recognise a claim for &raquo; wrongful life &laquo;, which is a claim brought 
by a child who alleges that the mother&rsquo;s physician or health care institution should 
have enabled her to have an abortion in view of the severe abnormality of the foe-
tus and consequently the severe disability of the child when born182. Such claims 
are contrary to public policy because imposing a duty on the doctor to advise an 
abortion on grounds of the child&rsquo;s likely disability would &raquo; make a further inroad on 
the sanctity of human life &hellip; [ and ] would mean regarding the life of a handicapped 
child as not only less valuable than the life of a normal child, but so much less valu-
able that it was not worth preserving &laquo;183. In addition, it is utterly impossible to put 
a value upon the child&rsquo;s loss in such a case, which requires a comparison between 
life in the child&rsquo;s present condition and not being born at all184, or to determine the 
degree of disability that would entitle the child to bring such an action185. 
</p>
<p>This approach accords with recommendations in two official reports, both 
of which noted the concern that an action for wrongful life would place doctors 
under intolerable pressure to advise abortions in doubtful cases lest they subse-

<p>quently be sued for damages186. Nevertheless, the court&rsquo;s reasoning has attracted 
considerable academic criticism187, with some commentators going so far as to 
call for the recognition of a cause of action for wrongful life in English law188. The 
facts of the leading case arose before the implementation of the Congenital Dis-
abilities ( Civil Liability ) Act 1976, which supersedes all previously effective legal 
provisions governing liability to children in respect of their congenital disabil-
ity189, and the Act&rsquo;s passage effectively precludes wrongful life claims relating to 
births from its in-force date in 1976 on190. It has been suggested191, however, that 
the subsequent extension of the Act to make specific provision for infertility treat-
ments192 has opened the door for wrongful life claims in a limited set of circum-
stances, namely, where the disability results from negligence in the selection of a 
damaged embryo to place in the mother, or damaged gametes to create the em-
bryo, but this has yet to be tested in court.
</p>
<p>3. Wrongful birth
</p>
<p>In the English legal literature, wrongful birth actions are seen to be based on the 
mother being deprived of the opportunity to have an abortion by the defendant&rsquo;s 
negligence ( eg in failing to detect an abnormality in the foetus ). They therefore 
raise policy considerations which overlap to a very great extent with those in the 
wrongful life scenario. Nevertheless, as in wrongful conception cases, the courts 
allow the recovery of damages for losses, including pain and suffering, arising 
directly out of the birth, plus a conventional sum for injury to reproductive au-
tonomy, though not the ordinary costs of child-rearing193. This approach has been

hypothetical abortion would have been illegal: in such a case, public policy pre-
cludes the award of damages195.
</p>
<p>In principle, actions for wrongful birth may be distinguished from actions for 
&raquo; wrongful conception &laquo;, where the defendant&rsquo;s negligence causes the pregnancy of 
a woman who does not wish to conceive, but the distinction is not watertight be-
cause, in a wrongful conception action, it may be part of the claimant&rsquo;s case that 
the defendant&rsquo;s negligence meant that she did not remain as alert to the risk of 
pregnancy as she might otherwise have been, and deprived her of the opportunity 
( which she would have taken ) to have an abortion196.
</p>
<p>II. Causation
</p>
<p>A. Causation&rsquo;s normative imprint in tort law
</p>
<p>Causation is a general requirement of liability in tort. It need not, however, be 
proven that the defendant personally caused the damage, as liability may be in-
curred as a joint tortfeasor for harm brought about by another person whose con-
duct the defendant has authorised, or with whom he was acting in concert, or with 
whom there is a relationship of employer and employee. Liability in such cases is 
independent of any causal connection between the defendant&rsquo;s conduct and the 
damage suffered, though the latter must of course be causally attributable to the 
conduct of the other joint tortfeasor. References in this section to &raquo; the defendant&rsquo;s 
conduct &laquo; should be read as including the conduct of a joint tortfeasor. 
</p>
<p>In common law systems, causation is typically considered to have two as-
pects: factual and legal. Factual causation is normally addressed through the well-
known &raquo; but for &laquo; test, which requires that the defendant&rsquo;s conduct be a necessary 
condition of the claimant&rsquo;s harm. Legal causation is the term applied to a num-
ber of further rules that limit causal responsibility to a sub-set of &raquo; factual &laquo; causes, 
such limits being seen as necessary to preempt the possibility of &raquo; Adam-and-Eve 
causation &laquo;197. These include principles of novus actus interveniens and remoteness 
of damage ( &raquo; proximate cause &laquo; ). Some writers dispute whether principles of legal 
causation are principles of causation at all rather than policy-based limitations

</p>
<p>on liability, and regard only the issue of factual ( or historical ) causation as truly 
causal198.
</p>
<p>B. Cause as a necessary condition
</p>
<p>Factual causation is normally addressed through the &raquo; but for &laquo; test, which has 
been explained as follows: &raquo; If you can say that the damage would not have hap-
pened but for a particular fault, then that fault is in fact a cause of the damage; 
but if you can say that the damage would have happened just the same, fault or no 
fault, then the fault is not a cause of the damage &laquo;199.
</p>
<p>Though the but-for test is generally regarded as a useful rule of thumb, it does 
not always yield the right answer200. In certain categories of case, the courts sub-
stitute alternative tests201. An alternative general theory of factual causation is that 
a cause need only be a necessary element of a set of conditions together sufficient 
for the result202. This differs from the but-for test in that causation is not excluded 
by the presence of a separate set of conditions that is also sufficient for the result.
</p>
<p>The traditional but-for test demands a hypothetical inquiry into what would 
have happened if the defendant had acted non-tortiously and, paradoxically, this 
means that &raquo; factual &laquo; causation actually requires us to look at what did not in fact 
occur203. It needs to be considered not just how the defendant should have acted 
but also of how the claimant would have reacted to the defendant&rsquo;s hypothetical 
conduct &ndash; for example, in a medical case, whether the claimant would have un-
dergone the treatment provided if properly informed of the risks204, or how he or 
she would have responded to proper medical treatment if it had been provided205. 
Similarly, where the defendant employer wrongfully failed to provide a safety har-
ness to a worker who fell to his death from scaffolding, it had to be shown that he 
would have worn the harness if it had been provided206.

</p>
<p>C. Omissions as cause
</p>
<p>It is a mistake to think that only positive acts ( &raquo; making things happen &laquo; ) can oper-
ate as causes, and hence give rise to liability, and that &raquo; doing nothing &laquo; can bring 
nothing about. In fact, the terms &raquo; act &laquo; and &raquo; omission &laquo; should properly be re-
garded as nothing more than labels that can be applied interchangeably to every 
instance of human conduct; the distinction does not reflect any deep, philosophi-
cal subdivision of human conduct into two essentially different types. The point 
is well-made by Hart and Honor&eacute;: &raquo; Human conduct can be described alternatively 
in terms of acts or omissions. &rsaquo;A medical man who diagnoses a case of measles 
as a case of scarlet fever may be said to have omitted to make a correct diagnosis; 
he may equally well be said to have made an incorrect diagnosis&lsaquo; ( Harnett v. Bond 
[ 1924 ] 2 KB 517, 541 per Bankes LJ ). Sometimes it is more appropriate to describe 
the conduct as an omission; if there is a legal duty to do an act, and the subject 
has not done it, the legally relevant description will be in terms of an omission to 
perform the act in question. But the description of conduct as an omission may 
not imply any bodily movements by the person whose conduct is in question: eg 
if the description is: &rsaquo;The defendant failed to inspect the electrical wiring.&lsaquo; Con-
sequently those courts and writers who are impressed by &rsaquo;setting in motion&lsaquo; as a 
prime instance of causation, and who further conclude that we can only set things 
in motion by ourselves making movements, find it difficult to understand how an 
omission to act can negative causal connection. It is now thought, at least in Eng-
land, that there is no special difficulty about omissions &hellip; In truth, no rational dis-
tinction can be drawn between the causal status of acts and omissions. &laquo;207
</p>
<p>D. Cumulative causation
</p>
<p>In cases of toxic exposure attributable to emissions from both D1 and D2, and in 
analogous cases, it is immaterial that V&rsquo;s injury would have occurred even if the 
exposure from either D1 or D2 was taken away. That is, it is not necessary to prove 
that either D1 or D2 was a but-for cause. It is necessary to prove only that D1 and / or 
D2 made a material contribution to the exposure, from which is inferred a mate-
rial contribution to V&rsquo;s injury208. Thus, where V contracts pneumoconiosis as a re-
sult of the gradual build-up in his lungs of silicone dust to which he is exposed in

<p>probably have caused the pneumoconiosis without the contribution from D2, D2 
is not a but-for cause of the condition. Nevertheless, he is liable for it on the ba-
sis that his more than trivial contribution to the cumulative exposure constitutes 
a material contribution to the injury209. The same applies where V suffers serious 
injuries in a road traffic accident attributable to the negligence of D1, leaving her 
in a weakened state which is subsequently exacerbated by her negligent treatment 
in D2&rsquo;s hospital; because of her weakened state, V aspirates her own vomit, which 
results in hypoxic brain damage. Both D1 and D2 made a material contribution to 
this injury, even if it could not be proven that D2 made any difference to the out-
come210.
</p>
<p>The quantum of liability in such cases depends on whether the injury suffered 
by V is divisible or indivisible. If the injury is divisible ( as where it is a progressive 
condition that develops in proportion to V&rsquo;s toxic exposure ), each D is liable only 
to the extent of his proportional contribution to the total exposure211. If the injury 
is indivisible, each defendant is jointly and severally liable in the full amount of 
V&rsquo;s loss212.
</p>
<p>E. Overlapping causation
</p>
<p>D1 and D2 injure V independently and consecutively, and the effects of the two in-
juries overlap. Consequently, neither D1 nor D2 satisfies the but-for test in respect 
of the area of overlap ( &raquo; the overlap injury &laquo; ). Whichever of them is hypothetically 
imagined away, the other would have caused the overlap injury anyway. Here Eng-
lish law&rsquo;s approach is captured in a set of three principles, all of which attach sig-
nificance to the order in which the injuries occur. To provide a complete picture, it 
is necessary to consider not just multiple tortfeasors but also the case of overlap 
between tortious and non-tortious injury.
</p>
<p>First, where the effects of a tortious injury are overlapped by the effects of 
some later non-tortious injury, the tortfeasor&rsquo;s liability in damages is extinguished 
from the time the non-tortious injury would have had the same effect. The award 
of damages should not place V in a better position than he would have been in had 
the tort not occurred213. Consider the following illustration. V injures his back in 
an accident at work for which his employer, D, is responsible. He is left fit for only 
light work, and so suffers a reduction in earnings. Subsequently, V suffers spinal

<p>401Part 5&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;basic&emsp;criteria&emsp;for&emsp;a&emsp;compensation&emsp;claim

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>disease which renders him totally unfit for work ( and would have done so regard-
less of the initial injury ). D is clearly liable for the reduction of earnings until the 
disease would have caused the same degree of disability, but does D&rsquo;s liability ex-
tend to the period after that date ? Applying the principle just stated, D&rsquo;s liability 
ceases when the spinal disease would have mimicked the effect of the work acci-
dent, and does not extend to any later period214.
</p>
<p>Secondly, where the effects of a tortious injury caused by D1 are overlapped 
by the effects of some later tortious injury caused by D2, D1&rsquo;s liability is not extin-
guished by D2&rsquo;s injury215. Otherwise V might &raquo; fall between two tortfeasors &laquo; in the 
sense that the aggregate of the awards against D1 and D2 might be less than the 
total loss suffered216. By way of illustration, consider a case where V is run down 
by D1&rsquo;s motor vehicle, injuring his leg with residual loss of mobility. Some time 
later, he is shot in the same leg by D2 in the course of an armed robbery, and the 
leg has to be amputated. V consequently suffers a further loss of mobility, which 
is clearly D2&rsquo;s responsibility. D1 clearly has to pay for the initial loss of mobility to 
the date of the shooting injury. But is it D1 or D2, or neither of them, who has to 
pay for the initial loss of mobility for the period after the shooting ? Applying the 
principle just stated, it is D1 ( not D2 ) who has to pay for the initial loss of mobility 
for the period after the shooting217.
</p>
<p>So far, only the liability of the first tortfeasor ( D1 ) has been addressed. The po-
sition as regards the second tortfeasor ( D2 ) is that he is entitled to &raquo; take his victim 
as he finds him &laquo; and is therefore liable only for the additional injury, if any, that 
he causes V218. So, where V&rsquo;s motor vehicle is involved in the space of a few weeks 
in two collisions caused by D1 and D2 respectively, and either collision on its own 
would have necessitated a respray of the car it falls to D1 to pay for the cost of the 
respray; D2 does not have to pay for what V already needed219. 
</p>
<p>F. Alternative causation
</p>
<p>Where either D1 or D2 injured V, but it is not certain which of them was in fact 
causally responsible, V must normally prove that the defendant he chooses to sue 
was more likely than not the cause of his injury. The classic illustration in English 
law is a case where V drinks tea from a urn at his workplace which, unknownst to 
him, has been poisoned with arsenic by persons unknown. Experiencing persis-

<p>tent vomiting, V goes to the casualty department of D&rsquo;s hospital. The duty doctor 
refuses to see him and V dies from arsenical poisoning. The doctor&rsquo;s refusal to see 
V is not a cause in fact of his death as there was little or no chance that effective 
treatment could have been given in time anyway, so D is not liable220.
</p>
<p>Courts in various common law jurisdictions have over time admitted a num-
ber of exceptions to the but-for test in various cases of alternative causation. Li-
ability has thus been imposed in the hunters&rsquo; scenario in Canada221 and in cases 
of mesothelioma from asbestos exposure in England222. Where V sustains meso-
thelioma through occupational exposure to asbestos dust during separate periods 
of employment with D1 and D2, and it is unknown whether mesothelioma is trig-
gered by exposure to asbestos on a single occasion or by cumulative exposure over 
a period of time, D1 and D2 are both liable to compensate V in proportion to their 
contribution to the total risk. This liability for &raquo; material contribution to risk &laquo; was 
first explicitly recognised in Fairchild v. Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd. in 2002. It 
is not limited to cases of mesothelioma or to cases where all the possible causes 
of the injury are tortious ( the &raquo; indeterminate defendant &laquo; scenario ) but can apply 
even when the possible causes include non-tortious factors, including V&rsquo;s own 
conduct223. But the courts have repeatedly emphasised that the liability must be 
regarded as exceptional224. The limits of the exception are, however, unclear and 
little attempt has been made to date to explain how it fits with English law&rsquo;s con-
sistent rejection of claims for loss of chance225, even though the chance of avoiding 
injury is simply the obverse of the risk of suffering injury226.
</p>
<p>As regards the quantum of liability, the traditional rule of joint and several li-
ability is applied in the hunters&rsquo; cases, but proportional liability has been the pre-
ferred judicial approach in the mesothelioma scenario227. In the leading, English

<p>case, the House of Lords explained that it was immaterial that mesothelioma was 
an indivisible injury because the basis of the liability in such cases was the wrong-
ful creation of the risk or chance of mesothelioma228. Consistency of approach 
suggested that each defendant&rsquo;s liability should therefore be proportionate to the 
risk he or she had created. Considerations of fairness also pointed to this conclu-
sion as the favour allowed to the claimant in admitting an exception to the but-for 
test created a potential injustice to the defendant, which could be &raquo; smoothed &laquo; by 
limiting the liability arising to a proportionate-share of the total loss229.
</p>
<p>By Compensation Act 2006, sec 3 joint and several liability is restored for mes-
othelioma cases but not other cases falling with the &raquo; Fairchild exception &laquo;. A per-
haps unintended consequence of the new provision is that an employer can be 
liable for the whole of the claimant&rsquo;s loss even where the asbestos exposure at-
tributable to him was much less than attributable to the general environment230. 
</p>
<p> &raquo; Market-share liability &laquo; is so far recognised only in a minority of US states, 
and has not yet received judicial acceptance in England or other Commonwealth 
countries.
</p>
<p>I recently undertook a survey of the differences between English and Austrian 
approaches to alternative causation, reaching the following conclusions231. Both 
systems are prepared to dispense with the ordinary requirements relating to proof 
of causation in ( some ) cases of uncertain alternative causation &ndash; and not just in 
the case of alternative defendants, but also where there is alternative causation 
with contingency. Both systems also have recourse, in some such cases, to pro-
portional liability. But there are some significant differences. In particular, the 
Austrian approach to alternative causation rests on a general theory ( potential 
causation )232, while the English approach is to make a largely un-theorised excep-
tion to ordinary rules. Conversely, adoption of proportional liability in England 
and Wales is in one way more comprehensive, because it is applied there to the in-
determinate defendant scenario as well as to cases of alternative causation where 
one or more of the possible causes is non-tortious. A further difference is in how 
the liability is conceived: under Austrian law, as a weakening of the ordinary re-
quirement of conditio sine qua non, and under English law as a redefinition of the 
damage in terms of the risk rather than the outcome. Of crucial importance to un-
derstanding the difficulty that English law has had in formulating a principled ap-

</p>
<p>proach in this area is the established standard of proof &ndash; the balance of probabili-
ties &ndash; which has to be displaced if proportional liability is to be applied, whereas, 
where a standard of ( very ) high probability or near certainty is applied, propor-
tional liability can operate within the framework provided by the rules on proof, 
inasmuch as there exists an intermediate zone between the probability necessary 
to prove causation, and the probability necessary to disprove causation were the 
burden of proof to be reversed. It is here that proportional liability might conceiv-
ably be employed &ndash; without amending the normal standard of proof. Where the 
standard of proof is the preponderance of evidence, there is no similar interme-
diate zone, so the recognition of proportional liability would entail the displace-
ment &ndash; at least in a category of cases &ndash; of the normal standard233.
</p>
<p>G. Damages for loss of chance234
</p>
<p>To understand English law&rsquo;s approach to the award of damages for loss of chance, 
an initial distinction must be drawn between what must be proven to establish a 
cause of action, and the quantification of damages in respect of a proven cause of 
action. At the quantification stage, percentage chance assessments are routinely 
and correctly made by the courts. So where a 19-year-old student suffered brain 
damage in a road accident and was awarded damages for loss of earnings, the 
Court of Appeal proceeded on the assumption that she had a 50 : 50 chance of qual-
ifying and obtaining employment in her preferred career ( drama teaching ) and 
awarded her damages for that loss of chance235. However, such cases are not cases 
of &raquo; loss of chance proper &laquo; because they deal with the quantification of damages, 
rather than whether loss of chance is itself to be treated as an actionable injury236.
</p>
<p>In general, English tort law sets itself against the award of damages for loss 
of chance in this true sense. Reliance upon the loss of chance theory is seen as an 
impermissible way of getting around normal limitations on the scope of tortious 
liability and generally applicable requirements of proof. To establish a cause of ac-
tion, it is normally necessary to prove each of its elements on the balance of prob-

<p>abilities. Once the balance of probabilities is tipped, the law treats any evidential 
uncertainty as resolved and no discount is made to the damages to reflect the pos-
sibility that things might have happened otherwise. If the court finds there was 
a 75 % chance that A injured B by his negligence, B is entitled to full damages for 
his injury, not full damages discounted by 25 %. Conversely, if the claimant fails 
to tip the balance of probabilities, he fails to establish his cause of action and his 
claim fails altogether. So if there was only a 25 % chance that A injured B by his 
negligence, B is entitled to nothing by way of damages, not 25 % of the notional 
full award. 
</p>
<p>As English law concerns itself mainly with liability for physical harms, and li-
ability for non-physical harms ( eg pure economic loss ) is exceptional, the claim-
ant must normally prove a physical injury resulting from the defendant&rsquo;s wrong-
doing, and is not allowed to reformulate his claim as one for loss of a chance that 
has no physical existence237. Liability for loss of chance is recognised, however, in 
those exceptional cases where pure economic loss is sufficient to establish a cause 
of action because losing the chance of financial gain is itself an economic loss238. 
The claimant establishes his cause of action by showing on the balance of prob-
abilities that he lost that chance as a result of the defendant&rsquo;s wrongdoing. The 
court then proceeds to the quantification of damages, which ( in accordance with 
normal principles ) reflects percentage-chance assessments of what would have 
happened but for the tort. So the claimant complaining that his solicitor has neg-
ligently allowed the time limit to expire on his compensation claim, suffers an 
actionable loss at the date on which the claim is extinguished, and the damages 
payable will be proportional to the claimant&rsquo;s now purely hypothetical chances of 
success in the time-barred action. 
</p>
<p>If liability is to be recognised in a true case of lost chance in connection with a 
physical injury, it must be by way of exception to the basic principles set out above. 
In fact, the possibility of such an exception was acknowledged by Lord Bridge in 
Hotson, and divided the House of Lords in Gregg v. Scott, with ( it seems ) two Law 
Lords in favour, two against, and one reserving his opinion. In what type of case 
might a loss of chance argument succeed, however, if it was rejected on the actual 
facts of both the leading cases ? To answer this question, it is necessary to identify 
three distinct situations. In the first, ( a ), the claimant&rsquo;s condition has resolved at 
the time of the defendant&rsquo;s negligence, but it is uncertain whether or not he had at 
that stage any chance of avoiding the injury. This was the situation in Hotson. The

</p>
<p>uncertainty is purely evidential, not inherent in the claimant&rsquo;s condition. In such 
a case, the claimant must prove on the balance of probabilities that he retained 
the chance of avoiding the injury at the relevant time. In the second situation, ( b ), 
the claimant&rsquo;s condition at the time of the negligence is known, but there is un-
certainty how his condition will develop subsequently and / or how he will respond 
to the treatment he receives. This uncertainty continues at the date of trial. This 
was the situation in Gregg v. Scott. As the risk of injury has not yet materialised, 
and may never do so, the claimant&rsquo;s action for damages cannot succeed. Lastly, in 
case ( c ), we come to the situation that has yet to come before the Law Lords. As in 
( b ), the claimant&rsquo;s condition at the time of the negligence is known but there is 
uncertainty inherent in his condition and / or the treatment he receives. But, un-
like case ( b ), the risk of injury has materialised and the uncertainty has therefore 
been resolved. This would have been the situation in Gregg v. Scott if the claimant 
had died before trial. It is submitted that, in this rather narrow category of cases, 
there remains scope in English law for recognition of liability for loss of chance, 
though it is far from certain that the courts will take such a step when the oppor-
tunity arises. Nevertheless, they have shown themselves willing to embrace inno-
vative solutions to problems of causal indeterminacy in other contexts in recent 
times239, and the possibility of further innovation cannot be ruled out entirely.

<p>Part 6 The elements of liability
</p>
<p>I. Introductory remarks
</p>
<p>Departing slightly from Koziol&rsquo;s terminology, I would entitle this section &raquo; grounds 
of liability &laquo; as this formulation indicates that the inquiry is into alternative bases 
on which a person may be liable for damage suffered by another. It is thus to be 
preferred to the phrase &raquo; elements of liability &laquo;, which suggests a list of items that 
are necessary components of a claim. That is not the case as regards the items con-
sidered below.
</p>
<p>II. Wrongfulness
</p>
<p>A. Damnum sine iniuria
</p>
<p>&raquo; The world is full of harm for which the law furnishes no remedy. &laquo;240 A person may 
sustain loss or damage and yet possess no remedy in tort, because his legal rights 
have not been infringed in any way which the law regards as wrongful, with the 
result that he has suffered nothing that amounts in law to an injury241. This doc-
trine is embodied in the Latin phrase damnum absque iniuria. An entrepreneur can 
compete freely against a trade rival, provided he stays within the law, even if his 
strategy is to drive the rival out of business242. At common law, a landowner incurs 
no liability for erecting a structure on his land that spoils the pleasant view previ-
ously enjoyed by his neighbour243. Nor is there any liability for seducing another 
person&rsquo;s husband, wife or partner. It may also be noted in this context that no 
damages can be awarded in English law for a person&rsquo;s death per se244 or for a per-
son&rsquo;s expectation of death in consequence of personal injury ( as opposed to pain 
and suffering caused by awareness of a reduction in life expectancy )245.

</p>
<p>B. What makes the infliction of harm wrongful ?
</p>
<p>There is no general answer to the question, what makes the infliction of harm 
wrongful in English law, other than to say ( tautologously ) that the harm must 
occur in circumstances where the elements of a tortious cause of action are pre-
sent. From this perspective, fault is regarded as an aspect of wrongfulness, and 
English lawyers quite frequently treat the two ideas as interchangeable. But, prop-
erly understood, there are aspects of wrongfulness that go beyond whether or not 
there was fault on the facts. For example, in the area of the economic torts, it is 
not enough for the claimant to show that the defendant intentionally caused him 
economic loss, for liability only arises if the defendant procures the violation of a 
right ( eg under a contract ) that the claimant enjoyed independently or used inde-
pendently unlawful means ( eg intimidating threats ) to cause that loss246. And, to 
establish the general liability for negligence, it must be shown that the harm was 
inflicted in breach of a duty of care owed by the defendant to the claimant. This fo-
cuses partly on the defendant&rsquo;s conduct, asking was it negligent with regard to the 
claimant, but the assessment whether or not the defendant owed the claimant any 
duty of care, and whether or not any duty that was owed extended to the harm the 
claimant suffered, has regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the 
harm actually sustained. Ultimately, the court must exercise its judgment whether, 
in the light of the foreseeability of the harm and the proximity of the relationship 
between the parties, it is fair, just and reasonable to impose on the defendant a 
duty of care247.
</p>
<p>C. A de minimis rule 
</p>
<p>Additionally, English law applies a de minimis  rule whereby unwanted physical 
changes in the claimant&rsquo;s person or property are treated as actionable damage 
only if they reach a given threshold. For example, where a group of claimants de-
veloped pleural plaques ( fibrous tissues on the membrane of the lung ) in conse-
quence of their exposure to asbestos, it was ruled that this did not constitute ac-
tionable damage. Although pleural plaques are an indicator of an enhanced risk of 
developing other asbestos-related conditions in the future ( eg asbestosis or meso-
thelioma ), the plaques were not harmful in themselves and would not themselves 
cause the development of those other conditions248.

</p>
<p>D. Omissions
</p>
<p>The common law&rsquo;s starting point is that there is in general no liability for omis-
sions or, to put it another way, that there is no duty to engage in affirmative actions 
to prevent the occurrence of harm to another. It is not enough to trigger such a 
duty that another person is threatened by a risk of serious harm that the defend-
ant could easily avert, or even that this would be for the general good249. The ap-
proach seems restrictive in comparison with that taken in most European legal 
systems250 but is supported as the most effective way of maximising individuals&rsquo; 
freedom of action, which would be imperilled if burdensome affirmative duties 
were to be imposed on them251. Another justification for the general rule of no li-
ability is the pragmatic concern that there may be no reason for holding any par-
ticular defendant liable for harm he could have prevented rather than all those 
other persons who were just as able to intervene252.
</p>
<p>By way of exception to the general rule, however, it may be recognised that a 
duty of affirmative action arises on particular facts. There is no definitive list of 
the circumstances that give rise to such a duty, but the following categories are 
recognised in the literature: the defendant&rsquo;s prior creation of a source of danger 
( even if entirely without fault ); the defendant&rsquo;s undertaking of responsibility for 
the claimant&rsquo;s welfare253; the defendant&rsquo;s occupation of an office or position of re-
sponsibility ( eg as the claimant&rsquo;s parent or employer )254; and the ownership or oc-
cupation of land255.

to found liability for a major environmental disaster involving the contamination of drinking 
water with arsenic, which put millions of Bangladeshis at risk.

</p>
<p>E. Pure economic loss
</p>
<p>English law adopts a general &raquo; no recovery &laquo; or &raquo; exclusionary &laquo; rule for pure eco-
nomic loss. The approach is ascribed, variously256, to the fear that liability might 
extend to an indeterminate class of claimants, in an indeterminate amount, 
thereby imposing an undue burden upon the defendant257, the lesser value of eco-
nomic interests relative to interests in the person or property258, the considera-
tion that many pure economic losses are not social costs, but simply involve the 
transfer of wealth from one party to another259, a belief that economic losses are 
more effectively distributed throughout society if they are left to lie where they 
fall rather than being concentrated on the defendant260, a belief that economic 
risks are more effectively distributed throughout society if this is left to negotiated 
risk-allocations by the parties involved261, and the absence of any right to make 
economic gains that can be regarded as infringed if the defendant is caused an 
economic loss262.
</p>
<p>The approach applies not just in cases where the economic loss suffered is 
entirely independent of personal injury or property damage, but also where it is 
suffered only because of injury to person263 or property264 of another ( &raquo; relational 
economic loss &laquo; ). A statutory exception is allowed by the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 
in respect of claims for loss of dependency on another person&rsquo;s death, though the 
claim is open only to a prescribed class of dependants, including ascendants, de-
scendants, spouses and ( subject to conditions ) unmarried partners. 
</p>
<p>A less drastic approach applies to the intentional infliction of economic loss, 
though the law stops short of basing liability simply on the intention to cause eco-
nomic harm or the unfairness of the conduct. Instead it is necessary to show that 
the loss resulted from the infringement of the claimant&rsquo;s ( contractual or other ) 
right265 or from the defendant&rsquo;s use of independently unlawful means to cause the 
harm266.

<p>411Part 6&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;elements&emsp;of&emsp;liability
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>Liability for the negligent infliction of pure economic loss may arise where 
the defendant has ( extra-contractually ) assumed responsibility towards the claim-
ant267 and in certain other, as yet narrowly-confined situations that cluster around 
this central case268. A more expansive approach is followed in some Common-
wealth jurisdictions, especially in connection with relational economic loss269 and 
costs attributable to defects in acquired property270. 
</p>
<p>This is an area in which the English courts, in particular, have been accused 
of proceeding in a rather unprincipled manner, on the basis of analogies with es-
tablished pockets of liability rather than convincing legal arguments. In a series of 
articles, Stapleton has consequently suggested that the &raquo; pockets &laquo; approach should 
be replaced with an agenda of policy concerns that the courts should expressly 
take into account: ( a ) the absence or controllability of the threat of indeterminate 
liability; ( b ) the inadequacy of alternative means of protection; ( c ) that the area 
is not one more appropriate to Parliamentary action and; ( d ) that a duty would 
not allow a circumvention of a positive arrangement regarding allocation of risk 
which had been accepted by the plaintiff    271. The approach advocated seems to 
bear some resemblance to the &raquo; 10 commandments of liability for economic loss &laquo; 
proposed by Koziol in his Basic Questions272.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>III. Fault
</p>
<p>A. On fault in general
</p>
<p>Except in torts requiring proof of intentional conduct, &raquo; fault &laquo; in English law may 
generally be equated with negligence, using that term to refer to a means by which 
a tort may be committed rather than as the independent tort of that name. The 
classic definition is that provided by Baron Alderson in Blyth v. Birmingham Water-
works Co. in 1856: &raquo; Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable 
man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of 
human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable 
man would not do &laquo;273.
</p>
<p>It is clear from Alderson&rsquo;s reference to the reasonable man that English law 
takes an objective approach to the question of what constitutes fault. It &raquo; elimi-
nates the personal equation and is independent of the idiosyncrasies of the par-
ticular person whose conduct is in question &laquo;274. It makes no allowance for the 
defendant&rsquo;s lack of the skill, ability, knowledge or expertise expected of those en-
gaging in the activity in question, even though the defendant is a learner275 &ndash; and 
even though every skill has to be acquired through learning and practice at some 
time. Instead, the calculation is whether ( as conventionally formulated ) the risk 
attributable to the defendant was unreasonable having regard to the probability 
of its eventuation, the gravity of the likely harm if it should eventuate, the costs to 
the defendant of taking precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk, and the social 
value of the activity undertaken ( if any ) &ndash; all these factors being assessed from the 
standpoint of a reasonable person in the defendant&rsquo;s situation276. All other con-
siderations being equal, more care must therefore be taken in activities that are 
especially likely to cause harm, or that risk very significant harm, even if that risk 
is unlikely to eventuate.
</p>
<p>As Honor&eacute; has noted, the effect of such an approach is the imposition of strict 
liability, that is liability without ( moral ) fault, in cases where the defendant is 
physically or mentally unable to reach the standards of the reasonable person277. 
He defends these outcomes, however, by reference to his theory of &raquo; outcome re-
sponsibility &laquo; in which he maintains that the imposition of liability without moral 
fault may be justifiable as a means of reinforcing the moral responsibility of the 
individual for his actions and their consequences; to accept a lack of skill or ex-
perience as defences would undermine the legal subject&rsquo;s status as a morally

<p>responsible agent because it would mean that the ability to take reasonable care 
of the interests of others could no longer be regarded as an essential aspect of le-
gal personality. On his account, it is only those who cannot ordinarily be expected 
to meet this basic standard of conduct who should be exempted from it.
</p>
<p>B. Children278
</p>
<p>There is in English law no fixed minimum age which must be attained before a 
child can be held liable in tort279, but it is a general requirement of tortious li-
ability that the defendant&rsquo;s act be shown to be &raquo; voluntary &laquo;280, which seems to re-
quire a certain capacity for voluntary action that may not be present in a very 
small child281. This seems to bear some resemblance to the position in other sys-
tems where the possession of necessary powers of discernment is a prerequisite 
for a finding of fault282, but it should be noted that a finding that the defendant 
acted involuntarily excludes liability for all torts, including torts of strict liability, 
at least where these are based on the defendant&rsquo;s own conduct, and not merely for 
torts based on fault.
</p>
<p>With older children, the question is simply whether the defendant, whatever 
his age, satisfied the requirements of the tort in question &ndash; for example, whether 
the child intended or foresaw the consequences of his actions, or whether he sat-
isfied the required standard of care. This is the standard of an ordinarily prudent 
and reasonable child of the defendant&rsquo;s age283. The child&rsquo;s age may thus be mate-
rial in assessing whether or not the claimant&rsquo;s injury was foreseeable as a &raquo; real 
risk &laquo; of the defendant&rsquo;s conduct284 and also in determining what precautions the 
defendant could reasonably have been expected to take against the risk of injury285.
</p>
<p>278 See generally K. Oliphant, Children as Tortfeasors under English Law, in: M. Mart&iacute;n-Casals ( ed ), 
Children in Tort Law, vol 1: Children as Tortfeasors ( 2006 ). In principle, the approach taken as 
regards children could also be applied to persons of advanced years, though I am not aware of 
substantial jurisprudence or academic discussion of the issue.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>There is no formal rule whereby children are held to a higher standard of care 
if they engage in &raquo; adult activities &laquo;286. However, the care demanded of a child is ef-
fectively the same as that demanded of an adult in certain circumstances where 
the child engages in an adult activity. A 17-year-old motorist undoubtedly owes 
the same duty of care as an adult motorist287 and it has been submitted that even 
a child of under 17, who is unable to drive lawfully on a public road by reason of 
his age, may properly be held to the same standard if it chooses to drive ( whether 
on a public road or not ) and has sufficient understanding of the need for care288. 
It should be noted that the standard of care remains that of an ordinarily prudent 
and reasonable child of the defendant&rsquo;s age; it is simply that the steps necessary 
to discharge the duty are the same as those required of an adult. A different result 
may well be warranted where the child is impelled to undertake an adult activity 
by force of circumstance &ndash; for example, where a child is left in a parked car whose 
handbrake fails, causing it to roll downhill, and the child attempts unsuccessfully 
to steer the car around a hazard before bringing it to a stop.
</p>
<p>IV. Liability for other persons and for things
</p>
<p>Liability for other persons and for things is normally based on the defendant&rsquo;s 
personal fault &ndash; for example, the failure to supervise a young child289 or leaving 
horses unattended290. Vicarious liability renders an employer liable for a tort com-
mitted by an employee within the scope of the latter&rsquo;s employment: this liability 
is independent of any personal fault by the employer, but ( in the usual case ) re-
quires fault on the part of the employee. The justifications for this liability are 
much debated, but it is generally accepted that they rest on a combination of dif-
ferent considerations, including efficient loss distribution, providing a just and 
practical remedy to prevent the injured person going uncompensated and, inso-
far as the employer chooses whom to employ and has control over what is done,

<p>deterring future harm291. Vicarious liability, however, does not apply to parents 
for the torts of their children, or to persons who commission others to help them 
with particular tasks, whether gratuitously or for reward292. However, where the 
defendant authorises another person to do something that constitutes a tort, or 
combines with another person for a common purpose, and the latter commits a 
tort effecting that purpose, the defendant may be liable as a joint tortfeasor &ndash; even 
though not at fault, and even though he has not caused the harm that results.
</p>
<p>At common law, there was no liability independent of fault in respect of things 
under one&rsquo;s control other than dangerous animals ( for which liability is now gov-
erned by statute )293. Statutory strict liability for defective products was imposed on 
their producer and ( within limits ) their supplier by the Consumer Protection Act 
1987, pursuant to the European Directive.
</p>
<p>V. Strict liability for dangerous activities
</p>
<p>Under the famous rule in Rylands v. Fletcher  294, a person who conducts exception-
ally hazardous activities on his land is liable to his neighbour if the hazard escapes 
and does damage to the latter&rsquo;s property. The rule has been subjected to so many 
limitations295 &ndash; many of them apparently expressing a desire to restrict the scope 
of liability without fault by whatever means possible &ndash; that it has become a practi-
cal irrelevance. The English courts have so far declined to abolish the rule296, but 
in Australia it has been incorporated within the general law of negligence as based 
on a species of &raquo; non-delegable duty &laquo;297.
</p>
<p>English law is almost unique in the European context in maintaining a fault-
based approach to liability for road traffic accidents. Though it is sometimes said 
that such a high standard of care is applied as to produce almost the same out-
comes as would result in a strict liability system298, my own impression is that this 
is not the case, though it is difficult to think what sort of evidence would be re-

</p>
<p>VI. Permitted interference
</p>
<p>The common law does not recognise a liability for harm resulting from an activ-
ity done with statutory authority299. However, a mere planning permission does 
not carry the same weight, and does not act as a defence against tortious liability, 
though its grant may be relevant in assessing whether the ordinary requirements 
of the tort are made out300. As noted above ( no 5 / 39 ff ), a person may be allowed to 
continue a tortious course of conduct if the court, in the exercise of its discretion, 
declines to prohibit it by injunction. In such circumstances, there is a statutory 
power to award damages for the future interference the person affected will suffer. 
But this is a liability for wrongful conduct that is tolerated rather than a liability for 
conduct that is actually permitted.
</p>
<p>VII. Other considerations
</p>
<p>Perhaps because the scope of ( true ) strict liability in English law is so narrow, fac-
tors like the economic capacity to bear the burden, the realisation of profit, the 
availability of insurance, and the concept of a risk community, do not feature sig-
nificantly in the legal discourse. Discussion of them is mainly limited to such con-
texts as vicarious liability301 and product liability302.
</p>
<p>VIII. Contributory conduct of the victim
</p>
<p>Until 1945, the victim&rsquo;s contributory negligence was a complete defence to tor-
tious liability. This rule came to be regarded as unduly harsh, and its effects were 
mitigated by various devices applied in aid by the courts, until finally the law was 
reformed by statute in 1945303. Under the Act, if the claimant304 is guilty of con-
tributory negligence, the court has a discretion to reduce the damages awarded

</p>
<p>to such an extent as it thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant&rsquo;s 
share in the responsibility for the damage. The word &raquo; share &laquo; used in the statute 
prevents the claimant being found 100 % contributorily negligent, but a claimant 
who shows a reckless disregard for his own safety may be regarded as having vol-
untarily assumed the risk of harm and so to be disentitled from compensation for 
it: volenti non fit iniuria  305.
</p>
<p>In principle, the same approach applies to children. Just as there is no fixed 
minimum age for children to be liable, neither is there any fixed minimum age 
below which, as a matter of law, a child is deemed to be incapable of contributory 
negligence. Whether or not a very young child is guilty of contributory negligence 
is a question of fact to be assessed in the circumstances of the individual case306. 
Still it is doubtless true, as a practical matter, that &raquo; [ a ] very young child cannot 
be guilty of contributory negligence &laquo;  307. In 1978, a Royal Commission proposed a 
statutory rule prescribing that children under 12 should never have their damages 
reduced for contributory negligence when injured by a motor vehicle, submitting 
that this broadly reflected the existing practice of the courts308, but the proposal 
was never enacted.

<p>Part 7 Limitations of liability
</p>
<p>I. The basic problem of excessive liability
</p>
<p>Fear of excessive liability &ndash; as evidenced by the frequent invocation of the famous 
&raquo; floodgates argument &laquo; &ndash; has been an abiding concern of English tort law for cen-
turies309. On occasion, it has been expressly relied upon by the courts as a reason 
for declining to recognise that a duty of care arises in particular circumstances &ndash; 
perhaps most notably in connection with psychiatric injuries310. Sceptics, however, 
argue that the force of the floodgates argument has been greatly exaggerated311.
</p>
<p>Quite apart from the ad hoc reliance upon policy considerations to restrict the 
scope of the duty of care, the courts have a number of other concepts that may be 
employed in order to limit the scope of tortious liability. Though sometimes ob-
scured by its extensive use of metaphor, the common law&rsquo;s approach to the restric-
tion of what would otherwise be excessive liability fits the pattern that one finds 
in most systems of supplementing the basic requirement of conditio sine qua non 
with additional limitations on liability, some ( but not all ) of which have tradition-
ally been regarded as causal. The principal examples of such limitations in the 
common law are the principles of novus actus interveniens and remoteness of dam-
age, which play a role that is functionally equivalent ( in broad terms ) to principles 
of adequacy in other systems312. The common law principles ( and, one suspects, 
principles of adequacy in other systems ) are broad-textured and allow the tribunal 
of fact considerable discretion in their application. They determine in some cases 
whether liability falls on a single tortfeasor or on two or more, and so reflect to 
some extent a legal system&rsquo;s general orientation towards either individualised cor-
rective justice ( as in the case of the common law, at least in England ) or the loss 
distribution which is accorded greater weight in some other systems.

<p>II. Interruption of the causal link
</p>
<p>Where both D1 and D2 are factual causes of V&rsquo;s injury, D1 is not liable for the in-
jury if D2&rsquo;s intervention negates legal causation between D1 and the injury &ndash; that 
is, if it &raquo; breaks the chain of causation &laquo; and so constitute a novus actus interveni-
ens. In such a case, only D2 is liable for the injury. A pair of illustrations may be 
given. First, D1 causes flooding of V&rsquo;s home, which has to be vacated during re-
pairs, and D2 ( a squatter ) enters the vacant property and causes additional dam-
age. D1 cannot be said to have caused the additional damage, and so is not liable 
for it, because D2&rsquo;s intervention was &raquo; novus actus interveniens &laquo;313. Secondly, V, a 
police motorcyclist, is injured in the aftermath of an accident caused by D1 at the 
exit from an underground carriageway; D2, the police officer in charge, orders V to 
ride against the flow of traffic to close the tunnel at its entrance; V is struck by an 
oncoming motorist who is driving without negligence. The sole legal cause of V&rsquo;s 
injury is D2, even though it would not have occurred without D1314.
</p>
<p>According to the influential thesis of Hart and Honor&eacute;  315, this process of se-
lection from among causally relevant factors is appropriately termed &raquo; causal &laquo; be-
cause it reflects distinctions made consistently &ndash; not only in the law but also in 
other areas of discourse, including ordinary speech &ndash; between &raquo; mere conditions &laquo; 
and &raquo; the cause &laquo; of an event. Responsibility is thus attributed ( not on every occa-
sion and not exclusively, of course ) on causal grounds. The metaphor of a &raquo; break &laquo; 
in causation indicates an intervention in the normal course of events. Hart and 
Honor&eacute;&rsquo;s detailed and subtle analysis leads them to suggest that legal causation 
between a factual cause of an injury and the injury itself is liable to be negatived 
if the injury results from an intervention that is deliberate and itself intended to 
cause the harm, or constitutes an abnormal and unexpected occurrence or con-
junction of events. As already noted, the thesis has been attacked on the basis it 
introduces policy considerations into what should be a purely factual concept316. 
Nevertheless, it has attracted a measure of judicial support in the English courts 
and been said to reflect &raquo; the individualist philosophy of the common law &laquo;317.

</p>
<p>III. Remoteness of damage
</p>
<p>By the rule established in the Privy Council&rsquo;s Wagon Mound decision318, liability 
is further restricted to harm that is of a type that was the reasonably foreseeable 
consequence of the defendant&rsquo;s tort. The most convincing justification for the 
limitation is the need to provide some mechanism &ndash; even if somewhat rough and 
ready &ndash; to keep liability within reasonable bounds, rather than any spurious equa-
tion of the issues of culpability and the extent of compensation by which foresee-
ability, as crucial to determining the former, is for that reason used as the test of 
the latter319. The limitation applies to most claims in tort, but not to claims based 
on intentional wrongdoing, in which the defendant may be liable for all losses di-
rectly flowing from the wrong320. 
</p>
<p>It is sometimes argued that the principle of remoteness of damage is sim-
ply a cover for the concealed policy choices of judges, but most commentators 
reject this, even though they are driven to accept that the traditional risk theory, 
which asks whether the risk of the type of harm in suit was reasonably foreseea-
ble, leaves much to judicial discretion in determining the relevant risk. To render 
the process of determination more transparent, Stauch has persuasively suggested 
that, rather than define the risk in terms of what damage was sustained, as is tradi-
tional, we should do so in terms of how it occurred ( the &raquo; revised risk theory &laquo; ). His 
focus is on the set of causal conditions necessary for the occurrence of the injury, 
and in particular upon those conditions which, added to the defendant&rsquo;s conduct, 
completed the relevant causal set. The question for the court is thus whether the 
possible completion of that causal set was a reason for regarding the defendant&rsquo;s 
conduct as a breach of duty. If not, the injury is prima facie too remote. Stauch 
submits that his is capable of withstanding the accusation that determinations of 
remoteness are entirely subjective or policy-driven. He concedes, however, that it 
may be legitimate to depart from the standard test for reasons of policy ( eg in the 
&raquo; thin-skull &laquo; scenario ), so long as the circumstances in which this is permitted are 
regarded as exceptional and limited in scope321.

<p>IV.  The protective purpose of the rule infringed
</p>
<p>In determining whether breach of a statute gives rise to a cause of action in a per-
son damaged by it, it must be established that the rule infringed was intended to 
protect persons in the class to which the claimant belongs from the type of harm 
that he suffered. One begins by asking what was the &raquo; mischief &laquo; that the statute 
was designed to prevent. In the leading case, the claimant sought damages for the 
loss of a number of sheep that the defendant ship owner had contracted to carry 
after the sheep were washed overboard during heavy weather. He relied upon the 
failure to comply with an order made under the Contagious Diseases ( Animals ) 
Act 1869 which required the sheep to be transported in secure pens. However, the 
court found that the Act was not passed with the purpose of protecting owners 
of livestock from having their animals washed overboard but merely for sanitary 
purposes, in order to prevent animals in a state of infectious disease from com-
municating it to other animals with which they might come in contact. As the 
damage complained of fell outside the objects of the statute, the claim could not 
be maintained322.
</p>
<p>It must also be shown that the claimant was a member of the class that the 
statute sought to protect, and it has been found, for example, that a regulation in-
tended to ensure safe working conditions could not be the basis of a cause of ac-
tion in favour of a fire officer called to the workplace323, and that the duty to keep 
the gates of a level-crossing in the proper position was passed in order to protect 
members of the public using the road, not the train driver324. 
</p>
<p>Similar reasoning is also employed in negligence cases at common law when 
it comes to defining the scope of persons and the type of harm covered by the 
defendant&rsquo;s duty of care. Thus, it has been decided, for example, that a property 
valuer must take care to supply correct information, and can be liable for the con-
sequences of the information being correct, but does not undertake to protect the 
purchaser from fluctuations in the market value of the property acquired, so can-
not be liable to the extent that the purchaser&rsquo;s loss on a transaction entered into 
on the basis of a negligent valuation was increased by a general fall in the property 
market325. Likewise, the scope of a doctor&rsquo;s duty of care in performing a sterilisation 
operation is to protect the woman from becoming pregnant but not to preserve

<p>Part 8 Compensation of the damage
</p>
<p>I. On compensation in general
</p>
<p>In English law, compensation is effected in money. There is no concept of restitu-
tion in kind, though the issue of a mandatory injunction may have the effect of re-
storing the claimant&rsquo;s pre-tort position in practical terms. Nevertheless, the court 
seeks &ndash; so far as a monetary award is able to &ndash; to put the claimant in the position 
he would have been in if no tort had occurred. In principle, the claimant is entitled 
to a full indemnity for all aspects of his loss, both pecuniary and non-pecuniary, 
even if the best the law can do as regards the latter is to make an award that is 
fair, rather than truly replacing what was lost. Normally quantum is for the judge, 
within the parameters established by previous cases, but, where a child is killed 
tortiously, a sum fixed by statute ( currently &pound; 11,800 ) is paid to the parents by way 
of bereavement327.
</p>
<p>The basic measure of damages in a case of damage to goods is the goods&rsquo; dim-
inution in value, which is usually calculated by reference to market prices. Though 
the cost of repair may provide a good indication of the diminution in value in or-
dinary cases, the claimant is not able to recover the full repair costs if these sig-
nificantly exceed the value of the damaged item and it would not be reasonable to 
have the repairs effected328. Exceptionally, repairs may be found to be reasonable 
even though their cost significantly exceeds the value of the thing repaired329. An 
item&rsquo;s subjective value may be taken into account, for example, where there is no 
relevant market by reference to which its value may be assessed, or only a market 
( eg in scrap metal ) that would significantly under-represent its use-value to its 
owner330.
</p>
<p>Exceptionally the amount that may be recovered is capped by statute331 or, as 
under the legislation enacting the Product Liability Directive, subject to a thresh-
old332. But there is no general reduction clause in English law or, so far as I am

<p>aware, in any other common law system333. Neither does English law make pro-
vision for the ( complete or partial ) release of an employee from liability even in 
circumstances where vicarious liability arises334; indeed, in strict law the employer 
is entitled to recover an indemnity from an employee for whose tort he is obliged 
to pay damages on the basis of vicarious liability335. However, industry-wide agree-
ments preclude this in practice in the overwhelming majority of cases336.
</p>
<p>The award of damages normally includes interest to compensate the claim-
ant for being deprived of the use of the money between the time of injury and 
settlement or judgment. Special damages usually carry interest at half the short-
term investment rate from the date of the accident. General damages awarded in 
respect of non-pecuniary loss carry interest at 2 % from the date of service of the 
writ337. No interest at all is awarded on general damages in respect of future pecu-
niary loss.
</p>
<p>II.  Periodic or lump sum
</p>
<p>In the common law, damages were traditionally recoverable once only and 
awarded as a lump sum. Historically, this approach was justified on a number of 
grounds: the need for finality in litigation, the desirability of giving the plaintiff 
a free choice how to spend the damages, and the avoidance of the administra-
tive costs entailed by periodic payments338. The lump-sum approach meant that, 
where the claimant&rsquo;s loss was continuing, the court had to anticipate all that the 
future held in store and adjust the damages awarded accordingly. In personal in-
jury cases, it has been said that this approach gave rise to &raquo; insuperable problems &laquo;: 
&raquo; The award, which covers past, present and future injury and loss, must, under 
our law, be of a lump sum assessed at the conclusion of the legal process. The 
award is final; it is not susceptible to review as the future unfolds, substituting fact 
for estimate. Knowledge of the future being denied to mankind, so much of the 
award as is to be attributed to future loss and suffering ( in many cases the major 
part of the award ) will almost surely be wrong. There is really only one certainty: 
the future will prove the award to be either too high or too low &laquo;339.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>A first attempt to address these problems was effected by the introduction in 
1982 of &raquo; provisional damages &laquo; whereby damages are initially awarded on the as-
sumption a specified deterioration in health will not occur, but the claimant is 
allowed to return to court for further damages if it does in fact occur340. But this 
was only a limited step, that remained tied to the lump-sum method, and parties 
sought informally to provide a periodic income for the injured claimant by de-
veloping what came to be known as &raquo; structured settlements &laquo;. Eventually, though 
perhaps surprisingly recently, a judicial power to impose a &raquo; periodic payment or-
der &laquo; was introduced341. It is believed that periodical payments are better able to 
reflect the claimant&rsquo;s actual needs and losses and remove many of the risks asso-
ciated with lump sums, while relieving the claimant of the burden of managing a 
large investment342. It is also an advantage of periodical payments that they more 
accurately correspond with what the injured person has lost, which is generally a 
periodic income.

<p>Part 9 Prescription of compensation claims
</p>
<p>I. The current law
</p>
<p>The ordinary limitation period, as English lawyers call it, is three years for per-
sonal injury343, and six years for all other actions in tort ( unless specifically pro-
vided )344. The shorter period for personal injury claims reflects a perception that 
there is a particular need to ensure the speedy trial of such actions while evidence 
is fresh in the minds of the parties and witnesses345. Time starts to run when the 
injury, damage or loss occurs or was reasonably discoverable346. An overriding 
time limit of 15 years from the date of the negligence or the damage ( whichever 
is the later ) applies in respect of latent damage not involving personal injuries347. 
The court has a discretion to allow a claim to proceed out of time in the case of 
personal injuries and death348, but not otherwise. In actions in respect of defective 
products, the court cannot override the prescribed time limit where the damages 
claimed by the claimant are confined to damages for loss of or damage to prop-
erty349, or ( in any case ) the overriding time limit of ten years from the time the 
defendant supplied the product to another ( or other relevant time )350. It may also 
be noted that a special time limit of one year is normally prescribed for actions 
brought in defamation and malicious falsehood351.
</p>
<p>II. Commencement of the prescription period
</p>
<p>The prescription period generally runs from when the cause of action accrues. For 
torts which are actionable without proof of damage, such as trespass and libel, 
this is the date of the tortious act. Where the tort is committed only if damage is

</p>
<p>proved, as in the tort of negligence, the cause of action accrues from the date of 
the damage352.
</p>
<p>In a negligence action in which facts relevant to the cause of action are not 
known on the date on which it accrues, an alternative three-year limitation period 
applies353. This runs from the earliest date on which the claimant first had both 
the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the rel-
evant damage and a right to bring such an action. &raquo; Knowledge &laquo; includes knowl-
edge which the person might reasonably have been expected to acquire from facts 
observable or ascertainable by him354. A different regime applies in respect of per-
sonal injury claims, in respect of which &raquo; knowledge &laquo; refers ( inter alia ) to knowl-
edge that the injury in question was significant, and that it was attributable in 
whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence, 
nuisance or breach of duty, and as to the identity of the defendant355. The &raquo; signifi-
cance &laquo; requirement is whether the claimant would reasonably have considered 
the injury sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages 
against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judg-
ment. In the ever more frequently occurring context of claims in respect of child-
hood sexual abuse, significance should not be assessed simply in the light of the 
immediate effects of childhood sexual abuse, but with regard to what the action is 
all about, which may well be long-term, post-traumatic, psychiatric injury356. 
</p>
<p>In the case of injury to a child, time runs from the date on which the claimant 
attains the age of majority ( 18 )357. Where the defendant has deliberately concealed 
any fact relevant to the claimant&rsquo;s right of action, time does not begin to run until 
the claimant has discovered that concealment358.
</p>
<p>III. Reform proposals
</p>
<p>In a report issued in 2001, the Law Commission found that the current regime of 
limitation is unduly complex, sometimes unclear and produces unfairness359. It 
recommended a simplified regime in which there would be a primary limitation 
period of three years starting from the date on which the claimant knows, or ought

<p>reasonably to know: ( a ) the facts which give rise to the cause of action; ( b ) the 
identity of the defendant; and ( c ) if the claimant has suffered injury, loss or dam-
age or the defendant has received a benefit, that the injury, loss, damage or benefit 
was significant. There would also be a secondary &raquo; long-stop &laquo; limitation period of 
10 years, starting from the date of the act or omission which gives rise to the cause 
of action. The Law Commission expressly acknowledged that this might result in 
the loss of the right to sue even before the claimant&rsquo;s cause of action came into be-
ing, but thought this necessary in order to protect defendants from claims being 
brought so long after the events to which the claim relates that defendants are no 
longer properly able to defend themselves, and to place some limit on their need 
to insure themselves against liability, while compensating them for the loss of cer-
tainty which is inherent in the adoption of a limitation regime dependent on the 
date of knowledge of the relevant facts by the claimant360. For claims in tort where 
loss is not an essential element of the cause of action, the date from which the 
long-stop period runs is the date on which the cause of action accrues. For claims 
in respect of personal injuries, the court would have a discretion to disapply the 
primary limitation period and no long-stop limitation period would apply other 
than in respect of product liability claims brought under the EC Directive.
</p>
<p>These proposals have not yet been enacted.

<p>  Preliminary remarks
</p>
<p>I.  General introduction
A.  The source of American tort law
</p>
<p>The American legal system is derived from English law. Thus, in the United States, 
tort law is fundamentally an area of law in which courts make, develop and re-
form the law. While English substantive law influenced American law at the outset, 
much of tort law developed in the latter part of the 19 th century after American 
courts were established and functioning1. Tort law is found predominantly in ju-
dicial opinions, and courts use those opinions as the source of law, as prescribed 
by the principle of stare decisis. While courts thus &raquo; make law &laquo;, they do so by way 
of decisions in individual cases that then are applied in subsequent cases. Courts 
must decide only the issues presented by the facts of the case before them and, in 
doing so, they do not engage in the sort of general and prospective lawmaking in 
which legislatures engage. Thus, while a court may decide to reject contributory 
negligence and employ instead comparative negligence, it would not then attend 
to the many consequential issues that must be addressed once a regime of com-
</p>
<p>1 Thus, for example, American courts did not follow what appeared to be a broad rule of strict li-
ability protecting landowners from harm caused by substances that escaped from their neigh-
bors&rsquo; property, established in Rylands v. Fletcher  [ 1868 ] Law Reports ( L.R.) 3 House of Lords 
( H.L.) 330. See Losee v. Buchanan, 51 New York Reports ( N.Y.) ( 1873 ) 476 ( rejecting use of strict 
liability for claim in which harm was caused to neighbor by exploding steam boiler ).

</p>
<p>parative negligence is adopted. Those matters would be left to future development 
as they arise in cases and are presented to courts. Similarly, a court would not pre-
scribe a threshold amount that must be satisfied before a tort victim would have a 
claim &ndash; those sorts of arbitrary determinations are thought the role of legislative 
law not the common law.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the hegemony of courts in developing tort law in the U.S., 
legislatures throughout the states have, since the late 1960s, enacted &raquo; tort reform &laquo; 
statutes designed to address a perceived problem with the operation of a variety of 
aspects of tort law. Typical reform legislation addresses damages: capping awards 
on non-pecuniary losses, imposing limits on the recovery of punitive damages, 
and changing the collateral source rule. Joint and several liability has been sub-
stantially modified such that it is no longer a majority rule in the U.S.2
</p>
<p>B.  The role of the jury
</p>
<p>At the same time, juries play a major role in civil cases in the United States. The 
right to a jury in civil cases is ensconced in the Seventh Amendment to the federal 
Constitution3, and virtually all states have a comparable provision applicable to 
courts in that state. Thus, any party to a tort suit has a constitutional right to have 
a jury decide the facts of the case. Not only do juries decide the historical facts that 
are in dispute, but juries are also assigned mixed questions of fact and law, such 
as negligence4, intent, and scope of liability5. The existence of and reliance on ju-
ries has had a major impact on the development of tort law in the United States6.

3 In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of 
</p>
<p>trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any 
Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law. U.S. Constitution 
Amendment VII; see also C.W. Wolfram, The Constitutional History of the Seventh Amendment, 
57 Minnesota Law Review ( 1973 ) 639, 653 ( explaining and documenting the U.S. commitment to 
civil jury that existed in the late 18 th century ).
</p>
<p>4 Unlike many European legal systems, in the United States, fault, wrongdoing, and negligence 
are collapsed together even though negligence is determined from an objective perspective. 
This is just one of many pragmatic features of U.S. tort law.
</p>
<p>5 Courts for over a century have referred to this element of a tort action as proximate cause. Be-
cause of confusion over the use of &raquo; proximate &laquo; as well as &raquo; cause &laquo;, the Third Restatement of 
Torts adopted &raquo; scope of liability &laquo; terminology, and we follow that usage in this United States 
Response.

<p>433 &emsp; &emsp; Preliminary&emsp;remarks
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>This use of juries has created tension in the development of U.S. tort law. Oliver 
Wendell Holmes in The Common Law7, often credited as the most important work 
in the intellectual history of tort law, provided four criteria for dividing the work 
between judge and jury:
</p>
<p>1. &raquo; Standards of conduct are for judges to set forth, while historical facts are for 
the jury;
</p>
<p>2. However, negligence or breach of duty is submitted to the jury, even when the 
doubt is about the appropriate standard of care rather than the facts;
</p>
<p>3. Nevertheless, submission to the jury is not required and when a &rsaquo;state of facts 
often repeated in practice&lsaquo; exists, judges should set forth the appropriate 
standard of care, leaving to juries only the question of historical fact;
</p>
<p>4. Setting forth those specific standards of care would further an important 
function of law: &rsaquo;narrow[ ing ] the field of uncertainty&lsaquo;. &laquo;8
</p>
<p>Holmes&rsquo;s vision for tort law was put into play in 1927 in Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad 
v. Goodman9. Goodman  involved a railroad crossing accident in which the plain-
tiff was injured while driving over railroad tracks, when defendant&rsquo;s train hit him. 
Defendant asserted that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent in crossing the 
tracks. Although this appeared to be a case in which maxim two was operative, 
and the jury would decide the matter, Holmes invoked principle three: &raquo; When a 
man goes upon a railroad track he knows that he goes to a place where he will be 
killed if a train comes upon him &laquo;10, he must take precautions, including stopping 
and getting out of his vehicle if unable to determine whether a train is bearing 
down on him. Not only did the adoption of a specific standard narrow uncertainty 
by providing a rule of law rather than a jury verdict having no precedential value, 
specific legal standards address the respective role of judge and jury, displacing 
the jury and leaving for the court a determination that, as it was in Goodman, is 
dispositive on the question of liability. The narrow rule that required stopping and 
departing from the vehicle limited the relevant facts to the point that there was 
no dispute of historical fact and no issue about whether the legal standard was 
satisfied. Depending on how often judges found repeated patterns and invoked 
Holmes&rsquo;s dictum to provide a specific rule of law, Goodman could have produced a 
system in which juries played a considerably subdued role in tort cases.
</p>
<p>Seven years later,  Benjamin  Cardozo  had replaced  Holmes  on the Supreme 
Court ( two other justices had also been replaced ) and, in another railroad cross-

</p>
<p>ing case, Pokora v. Wabash Railway Co.11, the Court effectively overruled Goodman, 
declaring that exiting the car and reconnoitering was not required of a driver 
crossing railroad tracks in all cases. Not only was the Goodman rule out of touch 
with ordinary behavior ( as any jury would appreciate, Cardozo might have added ), 
but different circumstances prevailing at a railroad crossing may require different 
precautions12. Thus, Cardozo  imbued in determinations of negligence what the 
Third Restatement characterizes as &raquo; an ethics of particularism, &hellip; which requires 
that actual moral judgments be based on the circumstances of each individual 
situation. &laquo;13
</p>
<p>With a general &raquo; reasonable care &laquo; standard owed to the entire world, the jury 
would be empowered to decide cases, unencumbered by the normative views of 
the judge as to the appropriate standard of conduct. It is common wisdom that 
the Cardozo view of jury hegemony won out and that the American tort system 
reflects that view14. Thus, Richard Posner, a prominent U.S. judge and former law 
professor, observed recently that while contract law has a number of constraints 
to limit jury authority: &raquo; Tort law does not have these screens against the vagaries 
of the jury. &laquo;15
</p>
<p>But tort law in the United States has not proceeded in that vein. Rather nu-
merous substantive doctrines and adjectival principles have developed that have 
prevented what might otherwise have been a free-wheeling, jury-dominated tort 
system16.
</p>
<p>The most important substantive doctrine reflecting the tension over judge-
jury authority is a robust duty doctrine that affords courts the opportunity, fre-
quently invoked, to screen individual cases in which, based on the facts of the 
particular case, they believe that liability should not be imposed17. By contrast, 
Continental European legal systems have very weak notions of duty operating in

<p>435 &emsp; &emsp; Preliminary&emsp;remarks
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>tort law18, and England&rsquo;s duty doctrine is a holdover from when it had civil juries19. 
Numerous additional aspects of United States law reflect this tension in the allo-
cation of decisional authority between judge and jury, which has no relevance to 
Germanic or other Continental European tort systems20.
</p>
<p>C.  The federal system of law making
</p>
<p>While the federal legislature has supreme lawmaking authority in those spheres 
in which it has authority, tort law ( along with contract and property law ) has 
been left to individual states &ndash; no broad federal laws govern tort law in the United 
States21. As a result, tort law is not uniform throughout the U.S. While there are 
pockets of considerable variation, such as joint and several liability and the pro-
fessional rescuer rule, a common core exists on many basic principles and even 
on many specific issues. The American Law Institute, which was founded in 1923 
to address uncertainty and confusion that existed in American common law22, has 
contributed to that common core through its Restatements in common law areas. 
Throughout this response, we attempt to reflect mainstream U.S. law as best we 
understand it and identify, where useful, areas of divergence.

<p>18 The Principles of European Tort Law ( PETL ) do not mention duty in the realm of personal 
injury claims. But cf European Group on Tort Law, Principles of European Tort Law. Text and 
Commentary ( 2005 ) art 4 : 103 ( addressing affirmative obligations to protect as a &raquo; duty to act 
positively &laquo; ). Chapter 5 of Basic Questions I, which explains the &raquo; basic criteria for a compensa-

defamation, malicious prosecution, and false imprisonment. See Lord Scott of Foscote / Justice

21 To be sure, the federal Congress has enacted many laws that affect the operation of tort law 
</p>
<p>in the states, sometimes supplementing, replacing, or displacing state tort law. For example, 
after a major oil spill off of the coast of Alaska, Congress enacted the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 
33 United States Code ( U.S.C.) &sect; 2701 ff which addresses the liability of oil polluters, includ-
ing to private parties who suffer harm as a result of an oil spill. Over the past 20 years, the U.S. 
Supreme Court has repeatedly found in federal regulatory legislation an express or implied 
preemption of state tort law. This preemption has ranged from cigarette warnings to fungi-
cides and herbicides to generic drug warnings. When federal preemption exists, state law is 
barred from operating, leaving injured victims with no recourse in tort law.

<p>D.  The structure and goal of this response
</p>
<p>We have read and carefully considered the entirety of Basic Questions I. In this U.S. 
response, we have responded to much of what is contained in Basic Questions I, 
especially when we thought that U.S. tort might be helpful to a reader consider-
ing commonalities and differences among different countries in their treatment 
of the issues addressed in Basic Questions I. That selection and the content of 
this report is unavoidably influenced by the views of the authors. We also found 
ourselves frequently expressing our views in response to theories and arguments 
contained in Basic Questions I that are not addressed in U.S. tort law to our knowl-
edge. Even for areas in which there is scholarly discussion ( and often disagree-
ment ), we have favored the side that we find more compelling rather than loading 
this report with all perspectives on a given area. The reader will find substantial 
reliance on the Third Restatement of Torts both because it represents a considered 
synthesis of tort law in the U.S. today and because one of the authors of this Re-
port was a co-reporter for substantial portions of the Third Restatement.
</p>
<p>We wish, in advance, to apologize for one aspect of this U.S. response. Because 
we have no facility with German ( or other Continental European languages ), we 
were unable to dig deeper into matters raised in Basic Questions I through the 
sources cited therein. On too many occasions our understanding of principles, 
doctrine, and analysis contained in Basic Questions I would have been much im-
proved were it not for our foreign language handicap.
</p>
<p>II.  Organizational matters
</p>
<p>American tort lawyers would be bemused with the organization of Basic Ques-
tions I. Tort law in the United States tends to be organized in one of two ways: 1 ) by 
the type of conduct required for liability ( eg, negligence, strict liability or intent ); 
and 2 ) the interest protected ( eg, bodily injury or reputation ). Thus, the most 
prominent contemporary treatise on U.S. tort law begins with a section contain-
ing several chapters on intentional torts involving bodily injury, personal property 
and real property and then proceeds with a similar section on negligently inflicted 
harm to the same interests23. Similarly, a leading torts casebook begins with the 
negligence claim for personal injury and in later separate chapters, claims based 
on strict liability and intentional torts, as well as claims based purely on economic, 
emotional, and other non-physical harms24.

<p>437 &emsp; &emsp; Preliminary&emsp;remarks
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>By contrast, Basic Questions I begins, after an introductory chapter, with rem-
edies25. In the course of that wide-ranging chapter, considerable attention is paid 
to injunctions &ndash; a most rare remedy in tort law in the U.S. &ndash; coordinating first-party 
insurance and social security with tort damages, and the separate, yet overlapping, 
functions of tort and criminal law. The core chapter on the elements of a claim, 
Chapter 5, does not distinguish among claim for harms to different interests, in-
stead setting forth issues applicable to all claims. While key tort concepts, such as 
causation, scope of liability, and affirmative duties are set forth in the recent Third 
Restatement of Torts, that Restatement is limited to tort claims involving harm to 
persons or property, implicitly acknowledging that those principles may be modi-
fied if claims involving different interests are asserted26.
</p>
<p>We also note that the U.S. makes a greater distinction between tort law and 
contract law than in countries with a Germanic tradition of law. &raquo; The Law of Obli-
gations &laquo; is not a common phrase in U.S. law, and students are taught in separate 
courses with separate texts and separate professors the law of contract and the 
law of tort. While tort and contract overlap in the U.S. as well27 and compete for 
dominance in those areas, recognition of that tension does not detract from their 
independence in the eyes of U.S. law.
</p>
<p>25 Basic Questions I, no 2 / 1 ff.
26 Thus, for example, the Third Restatement has distinct provisions for scope of liability depend-
</p>
<p>ing on whether the claim is one based on negligence or an intentional tort even if the same 
interest is implicated. See Restatement ( Third ) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional 
Harm ( 2010 ) &sect;&sect; 29, 33.
</p>
<p>27 For example in the areas of products liability and in express waivers of liability. See eg M.A. 
Geistfeld, Principles of Products Liability ( 2005 ) 29&ndash;40 ( explaining the doctrinal difficulties aris-
ing from the fact that some products liability claims are by purchaser / consumers while others 
are by bystanders ).

<p> Part 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>I.  The victim&rsquo;s own risk
</p>
<p>The central concept in this section28 &ndash; that losses should be borne by the victim 
unless there is good reason to shift the loss &ndash; and the reasons for it were expressed 
by Holmes in The Common Law: &raquo; The general principle of our law is that loss from 
accident must lie where it falls, and this principle is not affected by the fact that a 
human being is the instrument of misfortune. &hellip; If this were not so, any act would 
be sufficient, however remote, which set in motion or opened the door for a series 
of physical sequences ending in damage; such as riding the horse, in the case of 
the runaway, or even coming to a place where one is seized with a fit and strikes 
the plaintiff in an unconscious spasm. Nay, why need the defendant have acted 
at all, and why is it not enough that his existence has been at the expense of the 
plaintiff ? The requirement of an act is the requirement that the defendant should 
have made a choice. But the only possible purpose of introducing this moral el-
ement is to make the power of avoiding the evil complained of a condition of li-
ability. There is no such power where the evil cannot be foreseen. A man need 
not, it is true, do this or that act, &ndash; the term act implies a choice, &ndash; but he must act 
somehow. Furthermore, the public generally profits by individual activity. As ac-
tion cannot be avoided, and tends to the public good, there is obviously no policy 
in throwing the hazard of what is at once desirable and inevitable upon the ac-
tor. The state might conceivably make itself a mutual insurance company against 
accidents, and distribute the burden of its citizens&rsquo; mishaps among all its mem-
bers. There might be a pension for paralytics, and state aid for those who suffered 
in person or estate from tempest or wild beasts. As between individuals it might 
adopt the mutual insurance principle pro tanto, and divide damages when both 
were in fault, as in the rusticum judicium of the admiralty, or it might throw all loss 
upon the actor irrespective of fault. The state does none of these things, however, 
and the prevailing view is that its cumbrous and expensive machinery ought not 
to be set in motion unless some clear benefit is to be derived from disturbing the 
status quo. State interference is an evil, where it cannot be shown to be a good. 
Universal insurance, if desired, can be better and more cheaply accomplished by 
private enterprise. The undertaking to redistribute losses simply on the ground 
that they resulted from the defendant&rsquo;s act would not only be open to these objec-

<p>tions, but, as it is hoped the preceding discussion has shown, to the still graver 
one of offending the sense of justice. Unless my act is of a nature to threaten oth-
ers, unless under the circumstances a prudent man would have foreseen the pos-
sibility of harm, it is no more justifiable to make me indemnify my neighbour 
against the consequences, than to make me do the same thing if I had fallen upon 
him in a fit, or to compel me to insure him against lightning. &laquo;29
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I identifies a reason for shifting losses and that is the goal of 
&raquo; prevention of damage &laquo;30. That justification for tort law is controversial in the U.S. 
among torts theorists. Some eschew any instrumental goal for tort law, insisting 
that it is and should be a mechanism for correcting harms visited on a victim by a 
wrongdoer. Prominent among this non-instrumental school are Jules Coleman and 
Ernie Weinrib, although a number of others are adherents31. The idea of prevention, 
in the form of efficient deterrence, has gained considerable attention with the ad-
vent of those employing an economic approach to law such as Guido Calabresi and 
Richard Posner who began with an analysis of tort law32. The leading proponent of a 
&raquo; mixed vision &laquo; of tort law that eschews the idea of a single meta-theory to describe 
or justify tort law is Gary Schwartz33.
</p>
<p>We would note one other reason for shifting losses that had considerable sway 
in the U.S. during the rise of strict products liability. Many scholars and jurists 
recognized the importance of &raquo; loss spreading &laquo;. The idea is that while shifting a 
loss does not make it disappear, as observed in Basic Questions I34, shifting a cat-
astrophic loss so that many share in it can actually reduce the magnitude of the 
loss &ndash; at least in terms of utility &ndash; on the insurance principle and may further di-
minish the loss by providing the means for rehabilitation to the injured victim35.

</p>
<p>II.  An insurance-based solution instead of  
liability law ?
</p>
<p>The U.S. has adopted pockets of no-fault compensation. Occupational injuries, 
like Germany and Austria, are addressed through a compensation system that 
does not take into account employer or employee fault36. Legislation enacted in 
the wake of September 11 provided for compensation for victims of the attack on 
the World Trade Center and their families. A few states have enacted motor vehicle 
no-fault statutes that often do not completely displace tort law37.
</p>
<p>A word on one of the disadvantages of a no-fault system for dealing with acci-
dental injury addressed in Basic Questions I. If fault is not taken into account, the 
incentive to take care for one&rsquo;s own safety is diminished, which would &raquo; promote 
carelessness in one&rsquo;s own affairs &laquo;38. That is also the standard account for retaining 
a rule of contributory negligence in the economic analysis of tort law39. However, 
at the end of the day, this is an empirical matter not a logical one. Moreover, there 
is good reason to think that non-legal incentives, including in the case of individ-
ual behavior creating a risk of personal injury to oneself, largely dwarf any incen-
tives provided by tort law for appropriate self-regarding risky behavior40.
</p>
<p>III.   Strict limits and rigid norms or  
fluid transitions and elastic rules ?
</p>
<p>The discussion of delimiting different claims and F. Bydlinski&rsquo;s theory of a flexible 
system for law is difficult for a common-law lawyer to parse41. To be sure, the com-
mon law has much overlap between putatively distinct areas of law. All classifica-
tions of legal principles are somewhat artificial and useful only to the extent that 
they contribute to coherency and fairness in application of the law.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>American tort law once was captured by the all-or-nothing thinking described 
in Basic Questions I42. Consequently contributory negligence barred all recovery; 
a victim either recovered or he didn&rsquo;t. Contribution between jointly and severally 
liable tortfeasors was not permitted, and the &raquo; last wrongdoer &laquo; was the proximate 
cause of harm and should bear all liability43. That all-or-nothing approach dissi-
pated, resulting in major changes to U.S. tort law, throughout the 20th century44.

<p> Part 2  The law of damages within the system for the 
protection of rights and legal interests
</p>
<p>Despite the occasional availability of injunctive or declaratory relief, damages 
measured by the defendant&rsquo;s unjust enrichment, nominal damages, or punitive 
damages, compensatory damages is still the standard remedy in tort cases. The 
function of compensatory damages is primarily, in American courts&rsquo; opinions, to 
make the victim of the tort whole &ndash; that is, to compensate the victim &ndash; although 
deterrence is also sometimes discussed.
</p>
<p>Compensatory damages in tort cases come in three forms &ndash; &raquo; general &laquo;, &raquo; spe-
cial &laquo;, and &raquo; incidental &laquo; damages. General damages &ndash; the damages traditionally 
seen to be at the heart of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim &ndash; are non-pecuniary damages, which 
consist of pain and suffering, loss of consortium, emotional distress, loss of en-
joyment of life, or dignitary harm. Special damages are pecuniary damages &ndash; typ-
ically lost wages, medical expenses, or damage to property. Finally, incidental 
damages are costs incurred in mitigation &ndash; for example, in a auto accident case, 
the cost incurred by the plaintiff to rent a vehicle while the one damaged by the 
tortfeasor is being repaired. Each of these types of damages is recoverable by a 
tort plaintiff that has suffered physical or property damage. As explained in other 
chapters, however, a plaintiff may not usually recover where the sole injury she 
has suffered is emotional or economic. Although these rules are often couched in 
terms of &raquo; duty &laquo;, they are essentially limitations on the types of damages for which 
a plaintiff is permitted to recover.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most salient difference between the American remedial system 
and that of Europe is that in America damages are assessed by a jury, with little 
guidance provided by the judge. Despite common fears regarding the &raquo; Wild West &laquo; 
of jury damage awards, studies of tort jury verdicts have not borne out those fears. 
For example, in 2005, the nationwide median award for tort plaintiffs winning at 
trial in state courts was $ 24,000. This was only slightly higher than the average 
award in bench trials of $ 21,000. Moreover, tort recoveries generally have declined 
by 50 % since 1992. This trend is driven primarily by sharply declining verdicts in 
auto cases. By contrast, the median awards for products liability claims and medi-
cal malpractice cases actually rose during the same period.
</p>
<p>Jury instructions regarding damages in torts cases are typically sparse, lend-
ing little specific guidance. By contrast, legislatures have, throughout the past 
30 years, exerted increasing control over juries, capping damage awards as part of 
the tort reform movement, discussed above ( see no 6 / 2 ff ). Caps are often limited 
to general ( ie, non-pecuniary ) damages and often to particular types of claims,

<p>most notably medical malpractice. It is unclear whether the purpose of such de-
vices is to reign in damages awards seen to be disproportionate to the underlying 
wrong or injury, or simply to limit the raw number of tort claims.
</p>
<p>I.  Claims for damages
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I states that deterrence is predominantly a function of criminal 
law and, especially in areas where tort compensation would not provide adequate 
deterrence, criminal law fills in those gaps45. We are not familiar with European 
criminal enforcement46, but we are skeptical about the capacity of criminal law in 
the United States to provide adequate deterrence for the sorts of corporate mis-
conduct that produce mass torts, such as asbestos, Vioxx47, and DES48.
</p>
<p>First, criminal prosecutions of corporations in the United States are exceed-
ingly rare49. The number of corporations successfully prosecuted for crimes at 
the federal level has consistently fallen over the last decade. In 1999, there were 
255 such convictions50. In the 2011 fiscal year, only 160 business organizations 
were successfully prosecuted51. And, of course, those prosecutions cover the full

47 Vioxx was a prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) designed to treat acute

<p>pain and arthritis. It was withdrawn from the market when it was found to cause adverse cardio- 
vascular events. See McDarby v. Merck &amp; Co., Inc., 949 Atlantic Reporter ( A.) 2d 223 ( New Jersey

The two areas relating to tort law in which there has been more prosecutorial activity is in 
the environmental and workplace areas. Yet, the environmental criminal prosecutions are fo-
cused on harm to the environment rather than personal injury. Thus, Rockwell International 
pled guilty in connection with its waste dumping at the Rocky Flat nuclear facility and paid

<p>panoply of corporate misconduct that exists, including financial fraud, antitrust, 
and environmental crime.
</p>
<p>From another perspective, the major mass torts in the United States over the 
past 30 years have produced very little in the way of criminal prosecutions. Con-
sider asbestos, in which there were many punitive damage awards in the earlier 
years of the litigation based on egregious industry misconduct52. There has not 
been a single criminal conviction of an asbestos company in the United States. In-
deed, so far as we can tell, there has been only one criminal case brought in the 
United States, and the defendants were acquitted53. The first criminal conviction 
worldwide occurred in Turin, Italy in 201254.
</p>
<p>The Dalkon Shield mass tort involved an IUD ( intrauterine device ) that was 
constructed in a way that it wicked bacteria into the uterus of users, leading to 
sepsis, miscarriage, and death. The manufacturer became aware of these prob-
lems and proceeded to conceal and deny the problems until enough information 
leaked out that it was forced to withdraw the device from the market. The tort 
claims forced the company into bankruptcy. There was never any criminal pros-
ecution arising from this mass tort55.
</p>
<p>In another mass tort that produced punitive damage awards generated by out-
rage over misrepresentations and a concerted and sophisticated scheme to con-
ceal dangers, the tobacco industry has never been the subject of a criminal pros-
ecution56.
</p>
<p>There have been some criminal prosecutions in high profile tort cases but they 
do not provide comfort about the criminal law providing adequate deterrence for 
large-scale corporate misconduct. In the 1960s, the Wm. S. Merrell Co. and three of 
its executives pleaded nolo contendere to providing false information to the govern-
ment about one of the early anti-cholesterol drugs that caused cataracts in users 
and produced the first mass tort in U.S. history57. And there was a prominent, but 
unsuccessful, prosecution of Ford for its Pinto automobile that was condemned 
for trading lives for tort liability in its design58.

<p>More recently, the pharmaceutical company Merck pled guilty to a misdemea-
nor and paid a $ 321 million fine in connection with its Vioxx drug that was pulled 
from the market after analysis showed that the drug, prescribed for arthritis pain, 
increased the risk of heart attacks.
</p>
<p>However, the crime that Merck was charged with was only tangentially related 
to the heart disease its drug caused &ndash; Merck jumped the regulatory gun and began 
marketing the drug for arthritis before it was actually approved by the drug regula-
tory agency. Merck paid almost $ 5 billion to settle the civil cases, so the criminal 
fine was less than 10 % of its tort liability for its marketing of the drug for arthritis 
purposes before regulatory officials actually approved it for that purpose.
</p>
<p>These exceptions against the backdrop of a substantial lack of criminal en-
forcement in some of the most culpable, large-scale, highly public mass torts in 
recent years makes an American observer dubious about the adequacy of criminal 
law to protect against egregious corporate misconduct that threatens harm of the 
sort that tort law protects.
</p>
<p>II.  Punitive damages
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I59 reflects the Continental European attitude toward punitive 
damages: to put it simply, tort damages are for compensation and punishment 
is for criminal law. Accepting for the moment that tort law should leave punish-
ment to criminal law, there still is a case for punitive damages &ndash; putting aside their 
name &ndash; to facilitate deterrence of anti-social behavior60. Instead of &raquo; punitive dam-
ages &laquo;, we might describe them as &raquo; incentive-enhancing damages &laquo;61. When a re-
peat tortfeasor knows that the probability of a victim filing suit is less than 100 %, 
compensatory damages are inadequate to provide adequate deterrence. Victims 
may not claim for a variety of reasons: because they do not know who injured 
them, they are unaware of precautions that might have been taken to prevent the 
harm, they decide to forego suing because of the unpleasantness involved, too few 
lawyers practice tort law, some victims are risk averse about risking liability for the 
defendant&rsquo;s legal fees, or the damages are too small to support a lawsuit. In such 
a situation, compensatory damages will not deter the company from this course 
of action. Punitive damages, however, can be levied to provide incentives for the

<p>59 Basic Questions I, nos 2 / 55&ndash;61.
60 We note the Principles of European Tort Law acknowledge, if grudgingly, the role of deterrence 
</p>
<p>in tort law. See art 10 : 101 PETL ( &raquo; Damages also serve the aim of preventing harm &laquo; ). See Euro-
pean Group on Tort Law, Principles of European Tort Law.

<p>company to conform to the legal standard and create appropriate deterrence62. 
We note that, even in Europe, there has been increased interest in extra-compen-
satory damages when the standard measure of damages is inadequate to protect 
the interest involved63.
</p>
<p>Thus, we would observe about the famous case of Princess Caroline of Mo-
naco. The defendant magazine, Bunte, published an interview with Princess Caro-
line that had never occurred. The article was a fraud. But the German federal Su-
preme Court held that the profits made by the defendant had to be considered in 
determining the appropriate amount of damages awarded so as to deter future 
infringements of her right to personality64. Indeed,  Volker Behr, a German legal 
scholar, has remarked on the role of extra-compensatory damages in the German 
legal system:
</p>
<p>&raquo; Although the growth of [ exceptions to a pure compensatory award ] has 
arisen out of varied factual situations, it is indicative of a systematic attempt to 
enforce the underlying principle that illegal conduct must not pay. &laquo;65
</p>
<p>Behr cites several examples, including infringement of personality, to support 
his conclusion.
</p>
<p>62  Dan Dobbs advocates just such a legitimating role for punitive damages. See D.B. Dobbs, Ending 
Punishment in &raquo; Punitive &laquo; Damages: Deterrence-Measured Remedies, 40 Alabama Law Review 
( 1988 ) 831. Catherine Sharkey has proposed recognizing punitive damages as reflecting societal 
damage that provides a windfall to plaintiffs. She draws on a few jurisdictions that have pro-
vided for &raquo; split-recover &laquo; schemes for punitive damages, which provide a portion of the award 
to the plaintiff to encourage pursuit of such claims and the remainder to the state to minimize 
the windfall. C.M. Sharkey, Punitive Damages as Societal Damages, Yale L.J. ( 2003 ) 113. One dif-
ficulty with split-recovery schemes is that they create substantial incentives to settle the case, 
as the portion that would go to the state if a judgment were entered including punitive dam-
ages can be captured by the parties when the case is settled and there is no basis for determin-
ing that punitive damages were awarded.
</p>
<p>63 In 2009, the Institute for European Tort Law published a comparative assessment of punitive 
damages in common law and civil law systems, revealing at least some leaks in the no-puni-
tive-damages dam in European countries: H. Koziol / V. Wilcox ( eds ), Punitive Damages: Com-
mon Law and Civil Law Perspectives ( 2009 ). In 2010, there was a conference at the Ius Com-
mon Research School in the Netherlands on the Power of Punitive Damages. That workshop 
produced a volume by L.Meurkens / E. Nordin ( eds ), The Power of Punitive Damages ( 2012 ), with

<p>447Part 2&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;law&emsp;of&emsp;damages&emsp;within&emsp;the&emsp;system
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject of punitive damages, we wish to endorse the as-
sessment in Basic Questions I that punitive damages are a controversial matter 
in the United States66. There was a time when the growth in the award of punitive 
damages was troubling and the threat of punitive damages was deterring produc-
tive activity because corporate executives worried about these damages, over-esti-
mated their frequency and magnitude, and were risk averse67.
</p>
<p>In 1982, David Owen, after cataloguing the rise of punitive damage awards in 
products liability cases, wrote: &raquo; Such awards68 have become well accepted in prin-
ciple, and my concern is now that large awards of this type are becoming almost 
common. &laquo;69 Since that time, there has been a flurry of legal reforms that have lim-
ited the award of punitive damages in the United States. Some of those reforms 
are a result of the United States Supreme Court restricting punitive damages un-
der the constitutional principle of due process70 and others are the product of 
state legislatures that have passed a variety of reforms to limit punitive damages71.
</p>
<p>The results of those legal changes as well as attitudinal shifts are that puni-
tive damages are infrequently awarded in the U.S. today, especially in personal in-
jury tort litigation, the core of tort law. A recent study found that in 2005, punitive 
damages were only awarded in about 5 % of trials in which plaintiffs were success-
ful72. Since plaintiffs are successful in only about half of tried cases, that is 2.5 % 
of cases tried to judgment. And given the infrequency of case resolution by trial, it 
represents around 0.04 % of tort cases filed73.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the incidence of punitive damages in personal injury torts is only 
20 % of what it is for commercial torts. So, if we&rsquo;re interested in the frequency of 
punitive damages in personal injury tort cases, it is less than 1 % of cases tried to 
a verdict and around 0.01 % of cases filed. The median award in the 700 punitive

</p>
<p>damage awards in 2005 was &euro; 50,000, although the average was about &euro; 340,000 be-
cause of outlier high awards. Among the different class of tort cases, commercial 
tort claims &ndash; interference with contractual relations &ndash; had the highest median at 
&euro; 5.4 million.
</p>
<p>III.  Preventive damages
</p>
<p>It is true, as Basic Questions I argues74, that tort law does not recognize an action 
purely for preventive damages. From that premise, Basic Questions I proceeds to 
reason, first that prevention ( or deterrence ) is not the sole aim of tort law, sec-
ond that deterrence is secondary to compensation, which is the &raquo; primary task &laquo;75 
of tort law, and third that G. Wagner&rsquo;s argument in favor of preventive damages is 
not &raquo; very convincing &laquo;. An American tort observer would surely acknowledge that 
deterrence is not the sole aim of tort law. But surely compensation is not the sole 
aim of tort law, otherwise an injured person would be able to recover compensa-
tion from any deep pocket that the victim could find.
</p>
<p>As Basic Questions I recognizes at the outset, the default for harm that oc-
curs is that the victim bear his loss76. Something more than a need for compen-
sation is required for tort law to activate its cumbrous machinery. So, we believe 
that neither compensation nor deterrence are the sole aim of tort law77. An Amer-
ican observer might add that the relative balance of compensation and deter-
rence in tort law is not static but dynamic. The role of deterrence was signifi-
cantly enhanced in the latter part of the 20th century when courts began taking 
more seriously, prompted by scholars, the instrumental impact of tort law78. A 
Westlaw search of state negligence cases in which in discussing duty ( the central 
element in which U.S. courts consider policy ) the word &raquo; deterrence &laquo; appears pro-
duces hundreds of results79. &raquo; [ T ]he jurisprudence of modern products liability &ndash;

</p>
<p>whether based on negligence or strict liability &ndash; is replete with instrumentalist 
considerations. &laquo;80
</p>
<p>Indeed, from the apex of the 1970s and 1980s when &raquo; loss spreading &laquo; was a 
popular idea that found widespread acceptance, U.S. tort law has grown and rec-
ognized that compensation through the tort system is both costly and much de-
layed81. Much more significant to current theory about tort law&rsquo;s goals is the mor-
ally-based idea of corrective justice. The unfairness of wrongly causing harm to 
another is the occasion for damages to be awarded and the lost shifted from the 
victim to the wrongdoer82.
</p>
<p>Thus, we do not view compensation as the primary goal of tort law and cer-
tainly not one that displaces deterrence when damages are inadequate to fulfill 
that role. As a consequence, we find the idea of preventive damages attractive83.

<p>IV.  Criminal law
</p>
<p>U.S. law, consistent with the observation in Basic Questions I, recognizes the over-
lap between criminal law and tort law84. Victim compensation programs are wide-
spread, almost universal85, throughout the U.S., spurred by incentives provided 
by the federal government86. Tort law regularly uses criminal statutes to provide 
more specific standards of care than the general &raquo; reasonableness &laquo; requirement87. 
With some frequency, the same conduct is the source of criminal prosecution and 
a tort suit, as occurred famously in the death of Nicole Brown Simpson in which her 
husband, O.J. Simpson, was accused of homicide88.
</p>
<p>V.  The relationship between restitution and tort law
</p>
<p>In the U.S., restitution, for which the remedy is the disgorgement of unjust en-
richment, is an independent cause of action. It is therefore viable despite the con-
current availability of other actions, including torts. Thus, for example, if the de-
fendant purloined the plaintiff&rsquo;s egg washer and used it to produce commercially 
marketed eggs, the plaintiff would be able to bring a tort suit, a restitution suit, 
or both89.
</p>
<p>To succeed in a restitution action, a plaintiff must prove that: ( 1 ) the defend-
ant received a benefit; ( 2 ) at the expense of the plaintiff; and ( 3 ) it would be unjust 
for the defendant to retain that benefit90. The most notable distinction between

<p>451Part 2&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;law&emsp;of&emsp;damages&emsp;within&emsp;the&emsp;system
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>restitution&rsquo;s constituent elements and those of most tort actions is that a plain-
tiff need not prove wrongdoing on the part of the defendant. In other words, a 
defendant might be subject to a restitutionary remedy despite being a wholly in-
nocent beneficiary. For example, where the defendant&rsquo;s husband, unbeknownst to 
the defendant, embezzled money from the plaintiff and used the money to buy a 
life insurance policy, plaintiff was entitled to recover unjust enrichment damages 
against the innocent defendant when the defendant collected on the policy91. The 
plaintiff would not have succeeded in a tort action against the defendant because 
the defendant committed no wrong ( nor do the facts fit into any category of tort 
engendering strict liability ).
</p>
<p>A second distinction between restitution and tort law lies in the available rem-
edy: the remedy for a tort is compensatory damages &ndash; damages sufficient to re-
turn the plaintiff to her pre-tort state. The remedy for restitution is unjust en-
richment &ndash; disgorgement of any benefit gained by the defendant at the plaintiff&rsquo;s 
expense. For the owner of the above-mentioned egg washer, the remedy for the 
tort of trespass to chattels would be the machine&rsquo;s rental value, plus any damage 
to the egg washer inflicted during its unauthorized use. By contrast, unjust en-
richment damages would likely be measured by the defendant&rsquo;s profits traceable 
to use of the egg washer. Of course, in some cases, unjust enrichment damages 
might look very similar to those assigned in tort92. For example, had the defendant 
used the egg washer for personal use, damages would likely be measured accord-
ing to fair rental value pursuant to either a restitutionary or tort cause of action. 
Similarly, although fault plays no explicit role in restitution, a defendant&rsquo;s wrong-
doing often plays a role in courts&rsquo; choice among alternative means of measuring 
the defendant&rsquo;s unjust enrichment. For instance, in the case of the embezzled 
funds, described above, because the defendant was an innocent party the court 
chose not to award plaintiff the proceeds of the life insurance payout, limiting 
damages instead to the amount embezzled93.
</p>
<p>A third difference between restitution and most torts is the mechanism by 
which a damages award is enforced. A successful claim for damages in tort results 
in an order of attachment and execution, enforced by a court&rsquo;s order to the sheriff 
to seize and auction the defendant&rsquo;s property in satisfaction of the judgment. A 
restitutionary damages claim may be either &raquo; legal &laquo; &ndash; that is, enforced by attach-

92 The Restatement ( Third ) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment lists the following as possible 
</p>
<p>ways of measuring unjust enrichment: &raquo; ( a ) [ T ]he value of the benefit in advancing the pur-
poses of the defendant, ( b ) the cost to the claimant of conferring the benefit, ( c ) the market 
value of the benefit, or ( d ) a price the defendant has expressed a willingness to pay, if the de-
fendant&rsquo;s assent may be treated as valid on the question of price. &laquo; Restatement ( Third ) Restitu-
tion and Unjust Enrichment ( 2011 ) &sect; 49.

<p>ment and execution &ndash; or &raquo; equitable &laquo; &ndash; resulting in an in personam order of the 
court, enforced by contempt. The advantages of equitable over legal restitution 
( or tort ) are that: ( 1 ) equitable restitution allows the plaintiff to trace unjust en-
richment through conversions in the property&rsquo;s form &ndash; eg, from stolen property to 
cash to appreciated new property purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the 
stolen property; and ( 2 ) an equitable restitutionary order typically gives the plain-
tiff priority in bankruptcy over unsecured creditors and later secured creditors.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these differences, a plaintiff might, in the right case, suc-
ceed in both a restitution and tort claim and collect damages pursuant to both. 
Returning again to the stolen egg washer, the plaintiff might have recovered for 
damages to the machine itself in a trespass action and recover the defendant&rsquo;s 
egg-washing profits in an action for restitution. Of course, where damages would 
address overlapping injuries &ndash; for example, the fair rental value of the egg washer &ndash; 
the plaintiff would be barred from recovering under both theories by the general 
rule against double-recovery.

<p> Part 3 The tasks of tort law
</p>
<p>I.  Deterrence of fault and strict liability
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I observes that both strict liability and liability based on fault 
serve the function of deterrence94. U.S. scholars would agree but there is a nuanced 
difference in which they each contribute to deterrence. In theory at least, a poten-
tial injurer subject to strict liability will not take any greater care than one who is 
subject to liability based on fault. Here, we invoke the famous Judge Learned Hand 
calculus of risk, which specifies that an actor is negligent when the magnitude of 
harm risked by the actor&rsquo;s conduct discounted by the probability it will occur is 
greater than the cost of prevention95. Actors, on this account, should take all pre-
cautions that are cost justified in the sense that the precautions will be less costly 
than the accidents that would result if those precautions were not taken.
</p>
<p>Strict liability would not induce any greater care. A rational actor would not 
spend more on precautions than would be saved in avoiding liability costs. The 
only difference between fault and strict liability is with the distributional conse-
quences: actors would bear the costs of accidents that are not worth avoiding in a 
strict liability regime while victims would bear those losses in a negligence regime.
</p>
<p>The way in which strict liability can contribute to safety is by affecting actors&rsquo; 
behavior in at least three ways: 1 ) reducing the level of activity; 2 ) moving the ac-
tivity to a safer location; and 3 ) investing in research and development to produce 
new safety technology. One might wonder why fault-based liability cannot serve 
these functions. The answer with regard to the first two is that negligence is rarely 
used and perhaps ill-suited to determine the appropriate level of an activity, say 
transporting freight by truck. The appropriate mix of trucking, shipping, or air 
transport is a complicated question that the legal system is not well situated to 
make such determination96. The answer to the third question is that, as a matter

<p>of evidence and proof, it is very difficult to reconstruct what the optimal or reason-
able level of investment should have been at some point in the past.
</p>
<p>Third-party liability insurance does, as Basic Questions I observes97, dimin-
ish the deterrence function of tort law98. The law&rsquo;s acceptance of such contracts 
reflects the importance of the compensatory function of tort law99. Indeed, it was 
only after the development of liability insurance in the early part of the 20th cen-
tury in the U.S. that enabled tort law to grow and become a more significant force 
in the civil law100.
</p>
<p>Yet, in the U.S. at least, there are many forces and developments that amelio-
rate the negative effect of liability insurance on deterrence. Many very large com-
panies, because their size enables them to absorb the vicissitudes of chance, self 
insure against tort liability. Those that do not, typically have large deductibles, 
thereby insuring only against very large damage awards. Even with regard to large 
awards, liability insurance policies in the U.S. have limited coverage; often auto-
mobile liability insurance is sold with inadequate limits for the range of harms a 
driver may cause. And automobile insurance, as well as some other liability poli-
cies, are loss rated so that one&rsquo;s loss experience bears on the premiums that will 
be charged in the future101.
</p>
<p>II.  The penalty function
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I describes graduated awards based on the culpability of the de-
fendant. The U.S. is quite schizophrenic about this matter. Damages doctrine does 
not distinguish degrees of fault for purposes of the appropriate measure of dam-
ages. Rather, damages are determined solely by the extent of loss of the victim. Pu-
nitive damages are an exception to this principle, and when a defendant&rsquo;s conduct 
exceeds the threshold of fault for awarding punitive damages, then an additional 
measure of dollars may be extracted from the defendant102.
</p>
<p>Despite the law&rsquo;s level standard for determining damages, it is the jury that 
determines the actual amount. With regard to non-pecuniary damages for which

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>there is no objective measure, juries have considerable discretion in the amount 
they award. It is common knowledge that plaintiffs&rsquo; lawyers believe it is to their ad-
vantage to show defendants in the most culpable light possible, even when strict 
liability is the applicable standard. Those lawyers believe that damage awards 
are affected by culpability, and there is empirical evidence supporting that intui-
tion103. Thus, while the law provides for equal amounts of damage, juries have con-
siderable room to respond to their intuitions about the severity of a defendant&rsquo;s 
wrongdoing in awarding damages.
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I critiques the extreme claims of law and economics that effi-
ciency is or should be the sole goal of tort law ( or law more generally )104. Very few 
in the law and economics field in the U.S. maintain that claim today. Instead, law 
and economics analysis tends to proceed along the lines that: &raquo; if we wish to take 
efficiency into account, this is how the law might be structured. &laquo;105 Much law and 
economics analysis also includes an assessment of fairness concerns106. Indeed, 
Guido Calabresi, one of the early scholars who employed economic analysis to as-
sess tort law, acknowledged that fairness was a constraint &ndash; a veto power &ndash; on any 
reforms designed to improve tort law&rsquo;s capacity to further economic efficiency107.
</p>
<p>Many others have joined Basic Questions I in criticizing economists for rigid 
models that do not conform to human behavior. We might add that the failure of 
economists to test empirically the claims that their analysis lead them to is an-
other concern. Modeling that actually predicts or explains behavior may be valua-
ble even if aspects of it do not take into account the complexity of human behavior. 
But that value must be demonstrated by connecting it to real world phenomena.
</p>
<p>One major improvement in the work of economic analysis of law that has de-
veloped over the past several decades is the development and use of behavioral 
economics. This discipline, marrying psychologists and economists, provides a

</p>
<p>tort law ). Basic Questions I, fails to appreciate the scheme set forth by Calabresi, Accidents. 
Basic Questions critiques  Calabresi because of the difficulty of actors determining ex ante 
whether they are the cheapest cost avoider, in light of the complexity and amorphousness of 
the determination ( Basic Questions I, no 3 / 18 ). Yet, Calabresi, recognizing that difficulty, rec-
ommended that cheapest cost avoiders be determined on a categorical basis and that those 
categories be determined in advance of the behavior it addresses. Whatever the difficulties and 
flaws in Calabresi&rsquo;s scheme, it would provide far greater direction about when parties would be 
subject to liability rules than the current tort system with its ex post, case-by-case determina-
tions. ( There may be a difference to European law: duties of care are said to be determined in 
advance &ndash; at least to some extent that seems to be true. )

sions deviate from the economically rational model, and the implications of those 
&raquo; biases and heuristics &laquo; for the legal system108.
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I observes, in its criticism of law and economics, the assump-
tion that &raquo; everyone will observe the standard of care that is optimal in societal 
terms, since experience shows that very often it is the individual&rsquo;s own personal 
advantage that is accorded priority. &laquo;109 Economists, however, would wholeheart-
edly agree with this observation. Then, they would respond by explaining that 
their efforts are to use liability so as to temper self-interestedness and encourage 
behavior that takes into account the interest of others when engaging in actions 
that can cause others harm. Indeed, the famous calculus of risk standard for negli-
gence set out by Learned Hand in Carroll Towing110 should have precisely that effect, 
requiring actors to take into account the interests of others or be held liable when 
the risks imposed on others are greater than the gains to the actor of doing so111.
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I raises concerns about strict utilitarianism, which might 
lead to sanctioning the taking of another&rsquo;s property or even life if the benefit to 
the taker was greater than the loss to the property owner or the person whose life 
was taken112. Guido Calabresi and Douglas Melamed addressed this matter, distin-
guishing between property rules &ndash; which invest owners with rights that the state 
will protect &ndash; and liability rules &ndash; which invest owners only of a right to compen-
sation if harm occurs113. Property rights are protected from others who must bar-
gain for and reach an agreement to purchase the right. Other rights, say the right 
to avoid loud parties on neighboring property, may only be protected by a liability 
rule. But tort law does not determine property rights, rather tort law takes what 
property rights exist, and protects those rights with liability rules. Taking anoth-
er&rsquo;s property in the absence of an agreement by the owner to transfer her rights 
is not subject to the rules governing unintentional incursions on other property, 
but rather is governed by the rules of intentional torts for which there would be no 
utilitarian calculus applied to determine liability.

<p> Part 4  The area between tort and breach of an 
obligation
</p>
<p>The view expressed in Basic Questions I114 about the connection between and simi-
larities of tort and breach of contract would bemuse an American reader. Tort law 
and contract law are treated as distinct subjects in U.S. law. An important area of 
contract law &ndash; the sale of goods &ndash; has been withdrawn from the common law field 
and is the subject of a uniform statute that has been enacted in 49 states115. In U.S. 
law schools, tort and contract are taught in separate courses and monographs 
address one or the other, not both. The &raquo; law of obligations &laquo; is foreign to the U.S. 
legal system. American lawyers would not contrast and compare the obligations 
imposed by tort and contract, as Basic Questions I does116. Rather, the U.S. legal 
system considers tort obligations to be ones imposed by law to address relations 
among strangers. By contrast, contractual obligations are matters of voluntary 
agreement that arise from that agreement.
</p>
<p>The U.S. analog of the &raquo; third lane &laquo;117 described in Basic Questions I is promis-
sary estoppel, which is considered an adjunct to contract law rather than tort law. 
Promises can, however, be the basis for affirmative duties in tort law and therefore 
the basis of liability when conducted unreasonably118.
</p>
<p>U.S. law also confronts cases in which both tort law and contract law could ap-
ply. Products liability is one such important area, as is medical malpractice. Both 
of those areas, however, are limited to protecting bodily integrity and personal 
property interests. When economic interests are harmed because of contractual 
default, tort claims may also be asserted.
</p>
<p>For historic reasons, in the U.S. professional malpractice is governed by tort 
law and is not a matter for contract law. On the other hand, in products liability, 
a victim may assert either tort claims or warranty claims and recover if either of 
those claims affords a right to relief119. In the area of economic interests, contract 
law is ordinarily given primacy, although fraud may vitiate that primacy. Even in 
the field of personal injuries, contract law is often given primacy. Thus contrac-

</p>
<p>I.  Damage
A.  Recoverable damage and definitions
</p>
<p>Much of the general description of damage, recoverable damage, and pecuniary 
and non-pecuniary damage in Basic Questions I comports with U.S. law, although 
&raquo; harm &laquo; is often the term employed to describe these detriments122. Tort law in 
the U.S. also permits recovery only for legally cognizable harm123. Thus, some U.S. 
courts have decided that &raquo; pleural plaque &laquo;, a scarring on the lungs due to asbestos 
inhalation that can be objectively determined by radiography but has no clinical 
symptoms &ndash; at least until it develops into asbestosis &ndash; is not a legally cognizable 
harm124. Quite evidently, U.S. law also supports Basic Questions I conclusion that 
&raquo; the relevant definition of damage is legally based. &laquo;125
</p>
<p>B.  Non-pecuniary damage
</p>
<p>As with other legal systems, the U.S. is more restrictive in permitting recovery for 
non-pecuniary harm &ndash; more frequently referred to as emotional harm126. Emo-
tional harm is a more accurate term, because limitations on recovery for this as-
pect of harm is with regard only to stand-alone emotional harm and does not 
apply when the non-pecuniary harm is consequential to bodily injury. When non-
pecuniary loss is a result of bodily injury it may include physical pain as well as 
emotional harm, although the distinction between the two may be quite evanes-
cent.
</p>
<p>122 The Third Restatement of Torts provides: &raquo; Physical harm &laquo; means the physical impairment 
of the human body ( &raquo; bodily harm &laquo; ) or of real property or tangible personal property ( &raquo; prop-
erty damage &laquo; ). Bodily harm includes physical injury, illness, disease, impairment of bodily 
function, and death. Restatement ( Third ) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm

person&rsquo;s emotional tranquility. &laquo; Ibidem &sect; 45.

</p>
<p>U.S. law restricts recovery for stand-alone emotional harm not only because of 
the difficulty of determining whether it exists127 and the difficulty of valuing non-
economic harm128, as explained in Basic Questions I129. Other reasons thought to 
justify the more restrictive approach to compensating emotional harm include: 
1 ) uncertainty in assessing the extent of the harm and the concomitant difficulty 
of valuing it; 2 ) the widespread nature of emotional harm, particularly in the face 
of public tragedies such as September 11, 2001 in the United States and the death 
of Princess Diana in France; and 3 ) the concern that giving legal recognition to 
emotional harm will increase the extent of it130.
</p>
<p>In recent years, some U.S. courts have recognized a subtly different non-pe-
cuniary loss, variously identified as hedonic damage or loss of enjoyment of life 
( &raquo; LOEL &laquo; )131. This harm reflects the pleasures of life of which a victim is deprived 
because of bodily injury and is quite similar to the English concept of loss of amen-
ities132. Unlike pain and suffering this type of damage can be recovered in some 
jurisdictions even by a victim who is comatose or in a wrongful death action133. 
While damages awarded to those class of victims are not &raquo; compensatory &laquo;, they do 
reflect real losses caused by the defendant&rsquo;s wrongdoing. Not surprisingly, law and 
economics scholars support recovery for LOEL, as well as supporting damages for 
more traditional pain and suffering on deterrence grounds134.
</p>
<p>127 Very often, the existence of emotional harm is not seriously in doubt. Consider the reaction of 
passengers on the Boeing 787s that recently have had to do an emergency landing because of a 
variety of in-flight problems.
</p>
<p>128 In the U.S., this is a particular problem because juries award non-pecuniary damages not only 
without any reference to a market value, but also without any information about awards in 
similar cases. This results in substantial variation from case to case, although the authority of 
judges to order new trials, remittitur, and, in some jurisdictions, additur moderates this vari-
ation. Scholars in the U.S. have developed numerous schemes to regularize the award of non-
pecuniary damages. See Franklin / Rabin / Green, Tort Law and Alternatives9 724&ndash;726.

</p>
<p>damages for pain and suffering has long been criticized as requiring the trier of fact to mon-
etize a loss that is incommensurable with any monetary measure. We do not agree with the 
criticism. Pain and suffering are perceived as costs, in the sense of adversities that one would 
pay to be spared, by the people who experience them. Unless tortfeasors are made to bear 
these costs, the cost of being adjudged careless will fall and so there will be more accidents 
and therefore more pain and suffering.

</p>
<p>On the other hand, recent behavioral research provides an additional ground 
for caution in compensating for emotional harm. That work reveals that those 
who suffer serious losses have a significant ability to adapt to the circumstances 
and often do so with less consequence to their happiness than might otherwise 
be expected. Some legal scholars recommend, consequently, that LOEL damages 
not be awarded135 or that guidelines be developed and supplied to jurors address-
ing these claims136.
</p>
<p>C.  Non-pecuniary harm to legal entities
</p>
<p>A corporation or other legal entity may not recover non-pecuniary damages be-
cause, at least in this sense, a corporation is not human137.
</p>
<p>D.  Distinguishing pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages
</p>
<p>This difficulty, explained in Basic Questions I138, has particular salience in the U.S., 
where legislative tort reform has frequently imposed &raquo; caps &laquo; on damage awards 
for non-pecuniary harms, while permitting full recovery of pecuniary damages139. 
This has resulted in plaintiffs attempting to shift what traditionally has been 
treated as non-pecuniary damages into the pecuniary category and defense coun-
sel doing the opposite140. Thus, Professor Joseph King has proposed with regard to 
economic damages that &raquo; the victim should be compensated for past and future 
economic losses, and those economic losses should be broadly conceived to in-
clude sufficient money to help make the plaintiff whole and fulfilled in his current 
condition, or in other words a whole person today. &laquo;141

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>American courts do not recognize the concept of &raquo; frustrated expenses &laquo;, dis-
cussed in Basic Questions I142. Indeed, the rule that the plaintiff must prove that 
her injuries were in fact caused by the defendant&rsquo;s wrong is firm in American law143.
</p>
<p>E.  Real and calculable damage
</p>
<p>The terms &raquo; real&laquo; and &raquo; calculable&laquo; damage are not used by American courts. Courts 
do grapple with the analogous choice between damages measured by repair / replace-
ment cost and diminution in market value. For example, suppose that a company 
leaked toxic chemicals into the ground, contaminating neighboring land. Should 
the measure of damages for trespass be the cost of restoring the land to its former 
state, the diminution in the land&rsquo;s market value, or the cost of restoration plus any 
residual diminution in value ? Jurisdictions adopt a variety of hierarchies and sub-
rules among these choices, sometimes depending upon the type of claim involved144.
</p>
<p>F.  Positive damage and loss of profits
</p>
<p>In America, the economic loss rule bars recovery for purely economic losses, with 
some exceptions145. Thus, as a stand-alone injury, lost profits are generally not re-
coverable. As an incident to a claim for physical or property damage, however, or 
in any of a variety of business torts &ndash; eg, tortious interference with contract, fraud-
ulent audit, etc &ndash; lost profits are recoverable. As in Germany, American courts 
make no formal distinction between &raquo; lost profits &laquo; and &raquo; actual loss &laquo;. With regard 
to lost profits, however, the issue of certainty / speculation is often particularly rel-
evant. The general rule is that although a jury is permitted to make inferences and 
estimations of damages based on the evidence, they may not speculate as to the 
existence of damages. In the context of lost profits, this means that the plaintiff 
must prove, more likely than not, that she indeed suffered lost profits, and the 
plaintiff must offer evidence from which a jury reasonably might infer and esti-
mate an amount of loss.
</p>
<p>142 Basic Questions I, no 5 / 29 f.
143 This does not mean, of course, that a plaintiff may not offer proof of causation that is merely 
</p>
<p>inferential. But where a defendant can affirmatively prove that an asserted loss or expense was 
not caused by the defendant&rsquo;s wrongdoing, the plaintiff may not recover that expense.
</p>
<p>144 See eg Terra-Products v. Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc., 653 N.E.2d 89 ( Indiana Ct. App. 1995 ) ( holding 
that in environmental contamination cases, restoration costs must be ordered, even where 
economically inefficient ).
</p>

cussing the economic loss rule and its exceptions ).

<p>G.  Damages in the case of unwanted birth
</p>
<p>Three related claims fall under this general category. A &raquo; wrongful pregnancy &laquo; case 
is a suit filed by a parent arising from the birth of a child due to a physician&rsquo;s fail-
ure to perform properly a sterilization procedure. A &raquo; wrongful birth &laquo; case is one in 
which parents sue for the birth of an impaired child where the physician failed to 
diagnose the defect during pregnancy. Finally, a &raquo; wrongful life &laquo; claim is brought 
by a child who claims damage from having been born &ndash; typically arguing that had 
the doctor properly sterilized the parents or diagnosed the child&rsquo;s impairment, 
the parents would have been able to abort the pregnancy.
</p>
<p>Courts are split on whether to allow wrongful life claims at all. Some have de-
nied such claims by reasoning that to be alive in any state is better than not having 
lived at all146. Other courts have allowed recovery in such cases, but limited recov-
ery to the special expenses associated with the disability147. Although most courts 
allow recovery in claims for wrongful pregnancy and wrongful birth148, courts 
are sharply divided on the proper measure of damages. Several jurisdictions ap-
ply the &raquo; benefits rule &laquo; to such cases, allowing recovery but offsetting the costs 
of the child by the &raquo; worth of the child&rsquo;s companionship, comfort and aid to the 
parents &laquo;149. A few jurisdictions allow full recovery of all child-rearing expenses150. 
Most courts, however, allow recovery only for the costs associated with the preg-
nancy and birth and any extraordinary child-rearing expenses associated with the 
child&rsquo;s disability151.
</p>
<p>It is worth noting that although application of the benefits rule is deeply prob-
lematic when applied to wrongful pregnancy / birth / life cases, it is a broadly ap-
plicable ( if uncommonly relevant ) common-law rule of damages. This rule is cap-
tured in Restatement ( Second ) of Torts, &sect; 920: &raquo; When the defendant&rsquo;s tortious 
conduct has caused harm to the plaintiff or to his property and in so doing has 
conferred a special benefit to the interest of the plaintiff that was harmed, the 
value of the benefit conferred is considered in mitigation of damages, to the ex-
tent that this is equitable &laquo;152.

</p>
<p>II.  Causation
</p>
<p>A.  The necessity of causation
</p>
<p>Consistent with the universality of causation stated in Basic Questions I, U.S. law 
also requires a causal connection between the defendant&rsquo;s tortious conduct and 
the plaintiff&rsquo;s harm. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a legal system in which tor-
tious conduct and harm are not required to be tied together by factual causation153. 
Nevertheless several accommodations are made in the plaintiff&rsquo;s burden of proof 
when difficulties of proof and other policy grounds justify such.
</p>
<p>B.  The normativity of causation
</p>
<p>The authors of this report have a slightly different view about the normativity of 
causation in law from that expressed in Basic Questions I154. We find normativity 
in determining the harms about which tort law inquires. Thus, in determining 
legally cognizable harm155, tort law makes a normative choice about the harm for 
which compensation may be sought. When a court recognizes &raquo; lost chance &laquo; as a 
harm that tort law will recognize, it engages in a normative determination. Simi-
larly in defining the conduct about which tort law inquires, a normative choice is 
made. That it is defendant&rsquo;s tortious conduct, rather than defendant&rsquo;s conduct, is 
a normative choice. However, once those two framing issues, frankly normative, 
are resolved, the remaining inquiry as to whether there is a but for or conditio sine 
qua non relationship between harm and conduct is not normative, but objective156, 
because causation is not a phenomenon that can be directly perceived, it always 
has to be determined by inference from circumstantial evidence. That method 
of determination, however, says nothing about the objectiveness of causation. 
 
</p>
<p>153 A comment about the terminology employed in this report. We use &raquo; cause &laquo; or &raquo; connection &laquo; 
to mean the physical consequences of some act in producing some harm. Like the PETL, art 3, 
the Third Restatement of Torts, and Basic Questions I, no 5 / 56, we distinguish cause from the 
matter of whether, all other tort elements for liability being in place, the defendant will, how-
ever, not be held liable. Once again, we use the terminology of the PETL and the Third Restate-
ment and refer to this element as &raquo; scope of liability &laquo;. We note that the leading U.S. treatise 
similarly treats separately factual cause and scope of liability. See Dobbs / Hayden / Bublick, The 
Law of Torts2 &sect; 17 f.
</p>
<p>154 Basic Questions I, no 5 / 54.
155 See no 6 / 70 above.
156 Indeed, we would go further and suggest that once the framing matter is resolved, causation 
</p>
<p>in law is quite the same as causation in many other fields of inquiry, including scientific ones. 
See eg K.J. Rothman, Modern Epidemiology ( 1986 ) 11 ( &raquo; We can define a cause of a disease as an 
event, condition, or characteristic that plays an essential role in producing an occurrence of 
the disease. &laquo; ).

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>Similarly, law often relaxes the standard of proof imposed because of a paucity of 
probative evidence or even shifts the burden of proof. Conceding that these are 
normative responses to the availability of evidence also does not affect causation&rsquo;s 
objective nature.
</p>
<p>We concur with Basic Questions I that the process of assessing the quantum 
of money that will be awarded to an injured victim is not an objective matter157. 
However, U.S. law would view as distinct the determination of the quantum of 
damages to be awarded for a given harm from the determination as to whether the 
given harm was factually caused by the defendant.
</p>
<p>C.  Conditio sine qua non
</p>
<p>Almost all of what Basic Questions I expresses in this regard158 would draw approv-
ing nods from a U.S. audience. We might want to add an explicit qualification for 
multiple sufficient causes ( or overdetermined outcomes )159, because in that cir-
cumstance it is not the case that the harm could have been avoided in the absence 
of the defendant&rsquo;s tortious conduct. But that is surely a quibble. We also appreci-
ate the calm explanation in Basic Questions I to skeptics who complain about this 
definition of causation because of its inclusiveness. Other tort elements narrow 
the long list of factors that always are elements of the necessary causal chain lead-
ing to a victim&rsquo;s harm160.
</p>
<p>We should also explain a long and unfortunate dalliance with an alternative 
formulation for causation that has occurred in the U.S. The idea of a defendant&rsquo;s 
conduct constituting a &raquo; substantial factor &laquo; in producing the victim&rsquo;s harm was 
first aired by a U.S. scholar to address the matter of scope of liability161. And the 
first U.S. case to employ this term used it to deal with the problem of overdeter-
mined outcomes, in which neither factor is a conditio sine qua non162. Adding to 
confusion over whether &raquo; subtantial factor &laquo; addresses factual cause or scope of li-
ability was its adoption in the first Restatement of Torts in 1934 and that Restate-
ment&rsquo;s collapsing causation and scope of liability into the single element of &raquo; le-
gal cause &laquo;.163 That adoption of substantial factor for causation resulted in many 
courts throughout the U.S. employing it, and jury instructions and appellate court

</p>
<p>opinions are replete with reference to this standard for factual causation, as well 
as for scope of liability.
</p>
<p>The Third Restatement of Torts removes &raquo; substantial factor &laquo; from its treat-
ment of causation and scope of liability, commenting on its lack of analytical 
quality to guide a factfinder in making causal determinations and its potential 
to mislead, commenting: &raquo; With the sole exception of multiple sufficient causes, 
&rsaquo;substantial factor&lsaquo; provides nothing of use in determining whether factual cause 
exists. &hellip; The essential requirement, recognized in both Torts Restatements, is 
that the party&rsquo;s tortious conduct be a necessary condition for the occurrence of 
the plaintiff&rsquo;s harm: the harm would not have occurred but for the conduct. To 
the extent that substantial factor is employed instead of the but-for test, it is un-
desirably vague. As such, it may lure the factfinder into thinking that a substantial 
factor means something less than a but-for cause or, conversely, may suggest that 
the factfinder distinguish among factual causes, determining that some are and 
some are not &rsaquo;substantial factors&lsaquo;. Thus, use of substantial factor may unfairly per-
mit proof of causation on less than a showing that the tortious conduct was a but-
for cause of harm or may unfairly require some proof greater than the existence of 
but-for causation. &laquo;164
</p>
<p>D.  Omissions
</p>
<p>Once again, a U.S. reader would find the discussion of determining causation in 
the case of omissions contained in Basic Questions I165 quite comfortable. In the 
case of omissions, it is the affirmative duty to act that provides the aspect neces-
sary to frame the causal inquiry. Where omissions have been particularly trou-
bling in U.S. jurisprudence is the situation in which multiple omissions are each 
sufficient to cause the harm166.

</p>
<p>E.  Modification of the causation requirement
</p>
<p>As with Austrian and German law, U.S. law makes a variety of accommodations 
when evidence relating to causation is not reasonably available to the plaintiff. 
For a long time, those accommodations were justified on the ground that as be-
tween culpable defendants and an innocent plaintiff, the wrongdoers should bear 
the risk of a lack of evidence167. However, with the advent of comparative fault, 
plaintiffs may no longer be innocent, and this rationale for modifying the proof 
requirement for causation has lost persuasive force.
</p>
<p>Also similar to Austrian and German law, highly culpable conduct may justify 
even greater lenity for finding causation. Concerted action as described in Basic 
Questions I168 is recognized in U.S. law as a basis for holding all those engaged in 
the joint conduct liable for the harm produced by one of the joint actors169. On the 
factual, evaluative side, it is no doubt the case that juries are more likely to draw 
an inference of causation against a highly culpable defendant than if the defend-
ant&rsquo;s misconduct was relatively minor170.
</p>
<p>The U.S. authors of this report recognize the description of alternative liability 
in Basic Questions I171 and can state that the idea is widely accepted in the U.S.172 
They have some difficulty, however, with the analysis of the burden of proof in Ba-
sic Questions I. There, Basic Questions I states that in alternative causation &raquo; the 
causation by each relevant behavioural factor must be taken as proven when view-
ing both events in isolation due to the high concrete risk such behavior posed. &laquo;173 
In the U.S. proof that each of two tortfeasors created an equal risk of the harm that 
occurred to the plaintiff would not be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff&rsquo;s burden 
of proof. The standard of proof in the U.S. is a preponderance of the evidence ( or, 
equivalently, more likely than not ), and merely showing an equal likelihood would 
fall short of meeting that standard of proof174.

<p>F.  Proportional liability
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I explains that whether joint and several liability or several liabil-
ity is imposed in the alternative cause situation matters when one of the defend-
ants is insolvent175. That is the primary effect of joint and several liability versus 
several liability: the risk of insolvency is laid on the defendants in the former and 
on the plaintiff in the latter. We would observe that one other effect of the choice 
between the two in the U.S. is, even when both tortfeasors are solvent, whether 
plaintiff or defendant ( s ) must sue the other tortfeasors. With several liability, 
plaintiff only recovers the ( comparative fault ) &raquo; share &laquo; of those joined as defend-
ants176. By contrast, with joint and several liability, plaintiff can recover the full 
measure of damages from any one tortfeasor. This requires defendants to pursue 
other potentially liable parties for contribution or indemnity177. However, in the 
two hunters or mountain climber case, U.S. law would require that plaintiff join 
all those who might have been a cause of the plaintiff&rsquo;s harm in order to employ 
the alternative causation theory178.
</p>
<p>We note that the proportional ( or partial ) liability of the Principles of Euro-
pean Tort Law ( PETL ) is based on making a comparative assessment of each par-
ty&rsquo;s contribution to the risk of harm179. Thus, if two hunters negligently fire at the 
same time and only one bullet hits a third hunter and no other evidence indicates 
that one or the other was responsible, we would assess the risk contribution of 
each at 50 %180. We think that resolution of whether this &raquo; risk contribution &laquo; li-
ability should be joint and several or several is not special to this case. One still 
might argue that the two defendants are wrongdoers and the plaintiff is not and 
therefore the risk of insolvency should be placed on defendants. Of course, if the

<p>plaintiff also tortiously contributes to the risk, then the case for joint and several 
liability is much weaker181.
</p>
<p>Risk contribution has received limited acceptance in the U.S., primarily, if not 
exclusively, in the context of asbestos litigation182. Because workers&rsquo; compensa-
tion does not permit suit by injured employee against the employer, workers who 
suffer asbestotic disease must sue the manufacturers of the asbestos products to 
which they were exposed. Often, there are many such defendants and when the 
disease is not one that is progressive, such as cancer, determining which defend-
ant&rsquo;s products was a cause of the plaintiff&rsquo;s harm is not possible based on current 
scientific understanding and methods. Rejecting the use of alternative causation, 
the California Supreme Court in Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc183, crafted a risk 
contribution theory of liability. Rather than proving causation, plaintiff would be 
required only to prove that exposure to defendant&rsquo;s asbestos was &raquo; a substantial 
factor in contributing to the aggregate dose of asbestos the plaintiff &hellip; inhaled or 
ingested, and hence to the risk of developing asbestos-related cancer &hellip; &laquo;184.
</p>
<p>U.S. law would distinguish between the example of a patient falling ill due 
either to medical error or non-tortious forces and that involved in Hotson v. East 
Berkshire Area Health Authority185, discussed in Basic Questions I186. The former in-
volves alternative causation, albeit with one alternative cause arising in the vic-
tim&rsquo;s sphere. The latter involves an area known as lost chance or lost opportunity. 
In the U.S. unlike England, which declined to adopt a lost chance theory, courts 
have been more sympathetic to recognizing yet another adaptation to the require-
ment that plaintiff prove causation because the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain 
the requisite evidence187. Thus, U.S. tort law treats differently lost chance, albeit 
limiting it to the medical error context and alternative causation when there the 
competing cause is innocent188.
</p>
<p>181 With comparative responsibility in place, the case for either pure joint and several liability or 
pure several liability is not strong. See Restatement ( Third ) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability 
( 2000 ) &sect; 10 cmt a. A variety of hybrid systems is described and developed in ibidem &sect;&sect; C18&ndash;E19.

</p>
<p>U.S. law does so for precisely the reason described in Basic Questions I189, oth-
erwise medical professionals would be free of liability whenever their errors were 
less probable than not ( the civil standard of proof in the U.S.) the cause of the 
adverse outcome190. They have done so, predominantly, by recharacterizing the 
cognizable harm as the lost chance or opportunity of a better outcome191. Thus, a 
chance of a better outcome has value, and when a victim is deprived of it, he or she 
is entitled to compensation for that loss. However, U.S. courts have narrowly cir-
cumscribed this reform, limiting it to instances of medical negligence that deny a 
patient of a chance for a better outcome and where that lost chance is less than the 
required standard of proof192. Often unarticulated, but perhaps influential is the 
concern raised by Hans Stoll that Basic Questions I193 explains: if medical errors 
disproportionately result in lost chances below the standard of proof threshold, 
then liability will be systemically less than it would be in an ideal world. This defi-
cit is of more concern to the deterrence scholars194. We note another constraint on 
this theory &ndash; that reasonably good evidence of the magnitude of the lost chance 
must be available. U.S. courts reason that that condition is more often satisfied in 
the medical context, thereby providing another policy for limiting the application 
of lost chance.

</p>
<p>191 Inconsistently with the recognition of a lost chance as compensable in itself, most courts that 
have recognized lost chance as a compensable harm have limited recovery to instances when 
the adverse outcome actually occurs. See Franklin / Rabin / Green, Tort Law and Alternatives9 363.
</p>
<p>192 If it were not so circumscribed, this theory could completely displace the requirement of proof 
of causation. See V. Black, Not a Chance: Comments on Waddams, The Valuation of Chances, 
30 Canadian Business Law Journal ( 1998 ) 96, 98 ( &raquo; all cases of causal uncertainty may poten-
tially be converted into loss of chance cases by such a redescription of the harm &laquo; ). The au-
thors of this report have a difficult time understanding Basic Questions I, response to this con-
cern ( see no 5 / 90 ). The suggestion that lost chance is limited to &raquo; two particular events [ that ] 
pose an extremely high degree of concrete risk and thus were potentially causal &laquo; contains its 
own limitation on this doctrine. Moreover, the limitation does not accurately describe the 
lost chance theory, in which the medical error may have posed only a modest or even small 
increase in the risk of the adverse outcome. Yes, there are only two potential causes, but that 
is the serendipitous result of the context in which lost chance arises, in which the competing 
cause is one that is already proceeding. But even that potential cause may not be a high prob-
ability, as would occur in a lost chance case in which the probability of a successful outcome 
was reduced from 90 % to 80 % by the medical negligence.

</p>
<p>The international scholarly support for proportional liability described in Ba-
sic Questions I195 is also the case in the U.S. Numerous scholars, with modest vari-
ation, have recommended proportional liability especially in the toxic tort arena 
when available scientific evidence does not permit a plaintiff to prove causation 
to the requisite standard of proof196. At the same time, courts have been notably 
resistant to accepting these recommendations. One of the authors of this report 
supports that resistance predominantly on the ground that the statistical scien-
tific evidence brought to bear on toxic causation &ndash; being observational rather than 
experimental &ndash; is prone to small errors that are quite likely to produce outcomes 
that appear to support small increases in risk that could be the basis for propor-
tional liability197.
</p>
<p>G.  A comment on excursus
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I, after canvassing the difficulties and inconsistencies in recog-
nizing a limited lost-chance theory, concludes &raquo; it is astounding that manifold 
dogmatic difficulties, theoretical contortions and inconsistencies were merrily ac-
cepted in order to propagate an approach which offers only an insufficient, partial 
solution &hellip; ; yet on the other hand, it is represented as untenable when the existing 
rules are thought through to their logical end. &laquo;198
</p>
<p>In this critique, Basic Questions I demonstrates a desire for a theoretically 
pure law of tort. To be pure, a single meta-theory would be applicable and all rules 
would reflect that theory. While there might be disagreement about how rules 
should be structured to further that theory, it would be a decisive criticism if a 
rule did not further the theory, conflicted with another rule, served other goals ( at 
least without furthering the meta-theory ), or failed to go as far as possible in ser-
vice of the ends of the theory.
</p>
<p>By contrast, the authors believe that U.S. law is multi-faceted, and, given its 
common law source and the multiple jurisdictions playing a role in its develop-
ment, it does not reflect any single meta-theory. Indeed, in addition to serving a 
variety of goals &ndash; goals without any algorithm as to how they should be weighted &ndash; 
often a tort rule will reflect serendipity or a well-turned phrase in a court&rsquo;s opinion

<p>that then is carried forward by the common law system199. Sometimes the devel-
opment of law will be slow and halting toward achieving a given end; sometimes 
experiments in the law will occur, which upon experience and reflection are deter-
mined to have been a mistake200 or require modification201. Sometimes the needs 
of society change and so does the law in adapting to and accommodating those 
societal changes202.
</p>
<p>In the case of recognizing lost chance for medical errors, the fact that health 
care professionals are engaged for the express purpose of enabling a patient to 
achieve a better outcome for their illness or disease may support a fairness ration-
ale for limiting lost chance to health care professionals. Statistical evidence of the 
sort required for the functioning of a lost chance theory of recovery is important 
for administrative efficiency and coherence in litigation, providing additional rea-
sons for limitations on those to whom it is applied. An intuition &ndash; there is no evi-
dentiary basis for this of which we know &ndash; that medical errors of the sort involving 
lost chances tend to cluster below the applicable standard of proof, if true, would 
serve deterrence purposes. We concede that it is difficult to find a justification for 
limiting recovery for a lost chance to those instances in which the patient actually 
suffers the adverse outcome if the justification for lost chance is recognition of it 
as a compensable harm. Yet, this is one of many anomalies that occur in a com-
mon law system as judges accretionally attempt to work out a reform. Tort law in 
the U.S. is made from the bottom up, not from a top-down meta-theory guiding 
the development of the law.

<p>H.  Market-share liability

<p>We would suggest that Basic Questions&rsquo; I endorsement of market-share liability

</p>
<p>We are not confident that market share liability would be applied to the moun-
tain climbers case described in Basic Questions I204 if the case arose in the U.S. As 
Basic Questions I explains205, for market share to reflect the harm caused by each 
defendant, the risk of the relevant product or conduct must be the same. That is 
so with DES, which had a common formula, but we suspect that the risks created 
by the two mountain climbing defendants might well be different. The fact that 
we know that they each caused the same harm is a result of the small numbers of 
victims and actors and the fact that each actor&rsquo;s single act definitely caused harm. 
In DES, there were many women who were exposed but did not suffer the adverse 
effects. In the U.S., market share liability has been limited to products that pose 
generic risks. Thus, it has not been applied, for example, to asbestos product man-
ufacturers because different asbestos products create different risks depending 
on how easily asbestos fibres can break free, the proportion of asbestos in the 
product, and, more controversially, the type of asbestos fibres used in the prod-
uct206. If the conducts or products do not create equal risks, market share is not an 
accurate measure of the harm caused207.
</p>
<p>We should add that since the first decision adopting market share liability 
in 1980208, approximately 15 U.S. courts have decided whether to adopt a market 
share theory. Those courts have split right down the middle on whether to accept 
market share or deny it209. Most of the courts that have declined to accept it have 
cited institutional authority &ndash; the legislature should be the entity making such 
bold change in tort law rather than courts. To our knowledge, no state legislature 
has enacted such legislation in the 30 years since market share liability has been 
on the U.S. torts landscape.
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I also observes presciently on the practical difficulties and 
administrative costs of employing a market share approach210. We would add one 
more, resulting from the experience in the United States. Some market share deci-
sions gave preference to using the most local market to determine market share, 
which might be the pharmacy from which the plaintiff&rsquo;s mother obtained her pre-
scriptions or the municipality or region in which the mother lived at the time she 
obtained her DES prescriptions211. The desire to employ local markets was con-

<p>sistent with tort law&rsquo;s focus on individual justice &ndash; local market share would maxi-
mize the probability that manufacturers held liable could have caused plaintiff&rsquo;s 
harm. However, experience with the difficulties and costs of obtaining such proof 
led some later courts to adopt a national market share. Indeed, the high court in 
New York not only adopted a national market share but also held that a DES man-
ufacturer could not exculpate itself by proving that it did not distribute DES in the 
location where plaintiff&rsquo;s mother obtained her DES prescriptions212. By denying 
exculpation, the New York court assured that some DES manufacturers would be 
liable to victims whose disease could not have been caused by those manufactur-
ers. Adoption of such a scheme is a long step away from the tort system toward a 
compensation scheme.
</p>
<p>I.  Cumulative causation or multiple sufficient causes213
</p>
<p>U.S. law on this issue is in accord with that described in Basic Questions I &ndash; each 
of B1 and B2 would be held a cause of death of K214. As explained elsewhere215 most 
U.S. jurisdictions do not apply joint and several liability because of the advent of 
comparative responsibility. Thus, multiple tortfeasors whose conduct overdeter-
mines the outcome would be held liable under whatever form of joint and several, 
hybrid, or several liability scheme the jurisdiction applied to other multiple tort-
feasors who are each a cause of the plaintiff&rsquo;s harm.
</p>
<p>In anticipation of the next section on superseding cause, we have an observa-
tion about one variation of the multiple sufficient cause circumstances. Specifi-
cally, we address multiple sufficient causes when one is the result of a tortfeasor 
and the other is innocent and therefore in the victim&rsquo;s sphere. While the source 
of the force does not change its causal status, whether liability for damage is im-
posed in this instance is a distinct question. The law of damages does not impose 
liability in the superseding cause situation when an innocent cause occurs that 
would produce the same damage. Thus, damages in the case of wrongful death 
end at the point where the deceased would have died from natural causes. Dam-
ages in such cases do not extend indefinitely. As the analysis of  F.  Bydlinski de-
scribed in Basic Questions I reveals216, superseding causation is equivalent to cu-
mulative causation at the point where the superseding cause, sufficient to cause 
the harm, occurs. If damages law limits liability to the period before the innocent

the matter219. However, both British and Canadian law impose full liability on the 
original tortfeasor220. By contrast, the circumstance in which an innocent force or 
one within the victim&rsquo;s sphere is a duplicating cause221 is well settled in the United 
States, as explained above, on the basis of damages law, and the original tortfea-
sor&rsquo;s liability would end at the point where the second and innocent cause would 
have duplicated the harm.
</p>
<p>In the case of duplicated damages in which two tortfeasors are involved, the 
analysis by F. Bydlinski is attractive222. It is, however, as Bydlinski recognizes, in ten-
sion with another causal concept: preemption. Thus, if an outcome has already oc-
curred, a subsequent event cannot be a cause of that already-occurred outcome223.
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I attributes non-liability in this instance to a lack of duty 
or perhaps a lack of breach of that duty224. U.S. law, on the other hand, holds a 
broader conception of the duty owed &ndash; at least with regard to causing personal in-
jury or property damage. Thus, there is a default duty to act with reasonable care 
when one&rsquo;s conduct creates a risk to others225. Duty would not, in this regime, be 
as narrowly circumscribed with regard to specific property as explained in Basic 
Questions I.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I suggests a theory to justify imposing liability on the second 
tortfeasor226. The risk created by the second tortfeasor diminished the value of the 
property before the second tortfeasor destroyed it. Hence both are liable. A U.S. 
scholar suggested the same theory many years ago and a number of torts schol-
ars have endorsed this &raquo; value &laquo; theory227. One difficulty with this theory is identi-
fied in Basic Questions I228. If the second tortfeasor did not create the risk before 
the harm occurred, this theory will not work. Thus, not only is it only a partial 
solution to this problem, it would treat differently identically-situated tortfeasors 
based on the serendipity of the chronology of their tortious conduct in relation to 
victim&rsquo;s harm. The second difficulty is that for this theory to be viable, the victim 
would have to be able to recover damages from the second tortfeasor for the lost 
value without either physical damage to the property or having realized the loss229.
</p>
<p>The authors of this report find the proposed solution to this conundrum of 
duplicated harms by multiple tortfeasors in Basic Questions I attractive and rea-
sonable230. We would only suggest that a form of liability drawn from Chinese law, 
conditional liability, might best be appropriate. Thus, a conditionally-liable tort-
feasor is liable if the primarily-liable tortfeasor is insolvent. We suggest this form 
of liability because we see no persuasive reason to multiply the number of law-
suits in order to provide recourse to the first tortfeasor who, but for the serendip-
ity of another&rsquo;s later conduct, would be fully liable for the harm. We suggest that 
this recourse claim, if recognized will often generate separate litigation because 
the claim against the first tortfeasor will already have been resolved.

<p> Part 6 The elements of liability
</p>
<p>I.  Wrongfulness
A.  Wrongfulness of conduct or of result
</p>
<p>As with Austrian law, U.S. law only recognizes culpability ( wrongfulness is not a 
term in wide usage231 ) with regard to conduct not outcomes. The German concept 
of wrongfulness described in Basic Questions I232 would be completely unfamiliar 
to an American. Culpability or fault is assessed based on an objective standard233. 
The use of an objective standard reflects a trade-off that U.S. law accepts between 
a less complex inquiry with fewer administrative costs and the complications of 
proof required in assessing whether a party actually acted in a morally inappro-
priate manner. Throughout this U.S. response, we use fault or negligence inter-
changeably to reflect the objective standard of unreasonable conduct that is the 
core of the basis for liability for accidental injuries in the U.S. Where the objective 
standard is modified, as with children or the physically handicapped, we expressly 
distinguish it from a purely objective standard below.
</p>
<p>B.  Threshold harm limitations
</p>
<p>Threshold limitations are quite rare in U.S. law with regard to personal injury and 
property damage. Thus, unlike European countries that have taken advantage of 
the EU Directive permitting a threshold for strict products liability claims, no such 
limitation exists in U.S. law, not even for &raquo; bagatelles &laquo;. Perhaps because of the im-
portance of bodily integrity, victims who suffer any such harm may pursue a rem-
edy. As a practical matter, this lack of a threshold has not, with one exception we 
discuss below, caused any concern. The reason is that the costs of prosecuting a 
legal claim are so significant that no one would bring an action for trivial harm. 
Recall that the U.S. permits contingent attorneys&rsquo; fees ( which are in widespread 
use in tort claims ) and does not shift attorneys&rsquo; fees from the loser to the winner. 
</p>
<p>231 The Dobbs treatise on torts, the leading contemporary text, has no entry for &raquo; wrongfulness &laquo; in 
its index. See Dobbs / Hayden / Bublick, The Law of Torts2 Index 84.

<p>dren or those with physical handicaps, and then a blended objective-subjective standard is em-
ployed: How would a reasonable 12-year-old with the skills of the defendant-child have acted 
under the circumstances ?

</p>
<p>As a result, many &raquo; negative value claims &laquo; are such that the costs of prosecuting 
them are greater than the expected value of recovery and, thus, are never brought. 
For example, in the medical malpractice area, the best plaintiffs&rsquo; malpractice law-
yers will not accept a case unless the damages are in the mid- to upper- six figure 
American dollars because of the expenses of prosecuting such cases.
</p>
<p>With regard to some other interests, U.S. tort law does impose thresholds. 
Thus, the recent expansion of protection for emotional tranquility that permits 
certain negligence claims for pure emotional harm requires a showing that the 
victim suffered serious emotional harm234. This threshold is said to serve the dual 
purpose of eliminating claims for &raquo; routine, everyday distress that is a part of life 
in modern society &laquo; and in ensuring that those claims that are made are &raquo; genu-
ine &laquo;235, quite similar to the policies described in Basic Questions I236. Another area 
in which a threshold is imposed is in the nuisance arena. Thus, the interference 
with one&rsquo;s enjoyment of their real property must cause &raquo; significant harm &laquo;237, be-
cause, again, modest incursions on one&rsquo;s enjoyment of his or her land is endemic 
in modern society and must be borne without compensation to enable life to go 
on and others to act with freedom in pursuing their goals. It may be that these 
thresholds are required, despite the practical impediments to suits explained 
above, because these claims are frequently asserted as additional claims added on 
to other claims with more substantial damages238.
</p>
<p>The one area involving personal injury in which what might be described as 
a &raquo; threshold &laquo; limitation has been adopted is in asbestos litigation where some 
courts have declined to recognize pleural plaque as a cognizable injury, as ex-
plained above239. In effect, this ruling creates a threshold, requiring that asbesto-
tic disease progress to the point that it causes clinical symptoms. The reasons for 
imposing this limitation are quite compelling. Millions of Americans have been 
exposed to asbestos, and the claims of asbestos victims have bankrupted well over 
 
</p>
<p>234 See Restatement ( Third ) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm ( 2012 ) &sect;&sect; 47 and 
48. The Restatement relies, in part, on the same reasoning as in Basic Questions I: legal recog-
nition of small or modest disturbances of emotional tranquility could result in exacerbating 
the magnitude of such harms.

<p>75 companies in the U.S.240 The vast majority of those claims have been by pleural 
plaque plaintiffs whose claims are &raquo; bundled &laquo; by plaintiffs&rsquo; lawyers and settled on 
a global basis with asbestos-product manufacturers. The effect of those claims 
was to squeeze out recoveries by the victims who suffered the worst effects: meso-
thelioma is a cancer that is almost invariably fatal. Peter Schuck made a compelling 
case to defer resolution of pleural plaque claims so as to permit the worst-harmed 
plaintiffs to go to the front of the queue241. Denying compensable status to pleural 
plaque was one of the responses to this problem.
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I observes that, aside from thresholds, the requirement of 
breach of duty imposes another limit on small claims. Basic Questions I reasons 
that there is not a duty to avoid extremely minimal impairments to other people242. 
This observation must be qualified with the recognition that the extent of the harm 
caused by one&rsquo;s conduct is a function not only of the risk-creating conduct but also 
chance. Thus, for example, if the driver of an automobile barely collides with a pe-
destrian, only contacting two of the pedestrian&rsquo;s fingers, in most such situations the 
harm will be minimal. But, if the pedestrian is a world-class pianist, the damages 
may be quite substantial. Conversely, acting in a way that creates substantial risk &ndash; 
target shooting in a crowded square &ndash; may result in only minor injuries or even no 
injury. Chance is frequently the difference between minimal and substantial harm; 
the culpability of the defendant is not determinative of the magnitude of harm. For 
that reason, U.S. law has no threshold of risk creation for the duty of reasonable 
care to be imposed. Basic Questions I does add that breach of duty may not occur 
with regard to the creation of small risks &ndash; when those risks are outweighed by the 
value of the risk-creating conduct, a proposition with which the authors concur243.
</p>
<p>C.  The standard of care
</p>
<p>With regard to U.S. law on the standard of care, we can best demonstrate the con-
gruity between U.S. law and that described in Basic Questions I244 by borrowing 
from the Third Restatement&rsquo;s explanation of this matter:
</p>
<p>240 See S.J. Carroll / D. Hensler / J. Gross / E.M. Sloss / M. Schonlau / A. Abrahamse / J.S. Ashwood, Asbestos

vard Journal of Law &amp; Technology ( 1992 ) 541.
</p>
<p>242 Basic Questions I, no 6 / 35.
243 Perhaps the language in Basic Questions I suggesting no duty is a result of the rather casual 
</p>
<p>treatment of duty in civil law countries. In the U.S., duty is an explicit element of a claim for 
accidental injury and plays an important role injecting the court into deciding which claims 
should go forward for consideration by the jury and which claims should be denied. See

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>A person acts negligently if the person does not exercise reasonable care un-
der all the circumstances. Primary factors to consider in ascertaining whether the 
person&rsquo;s conduct lacks reasonable care are the foreseeable likelihood that the per-
son&rsquo;s conduct will result in harm, the foreseeable severity of any harm that may 
ensue, and the burden of precautions to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm245.
</p>
<p>The Restatement elaborates on this basic norm: the balancing approach rests 
on and expresses a simple idea. Conduct is negligent if its disadvantages out-
weigh its advantages, while conduct is not negligent if its advantages outweigh 
its disadvantages. The disadvantage in question is the magnitude of risk that the 
conduct occasions; as noted, the phrase &raquo; magnitude of the risk &laquo; includes both the 
foreseeable likelihood of harm and the foreseeable severity of harm that might en-
sue. The &raquo; advantages &laquo; of the conduct relate to the burden of risk prevention that 
is avoided when the actor declines to incorporate some precaution. The actor&rsquo;s 
conduct is hence negligent if the magnitude of the risk outweighs the burden of 
risk prevention. The burden of precautions can take a very wide variety of forms. 
In many cases it is a financial burden borne originally by the actor, although likely 
passed on, to a substantial extent, to the actor&rsquo;s customers. In highway cases, the 
burden can be the delays experienced by motorists in driving more slowly, and the 
greater level of exertion motorists must make in maintaining a constant lookout. 
In cases in which a gun owner is held liable for negligently storing a gun, thereby 
giving access to people who might use the gun improperly, the burden is the 
greater inconvenience the owner incurs in storing the gun in a more secure way246.
</p>
<p>D.  Omissions
</p>
<p>Before contrasting U.S. law with that explained in Basic Questions I247, we wish to 
make a clarification that has often confused U.S. courts. An omission to act may, 
in fact, be subject to the ordinary duty of care if the entirety of the actor&rsquo;s conduct 
created a risk that threatens others. Thus, the case of a driver of an automobile 
who omits to apply her brakes at a red light would not be viewed as involving an 
omission248. The driver&rsquo;s conduct in operating her automobile created a risk to 
others and thereby required the exercise of reasonable care with regard to those 
risks and an omission to act could be the basis for breaching that obligation. Simi-
larly, the building or acquiring of a dangerous building249 would subject the actor

<p>to the ordinary duty of reasonable care and would not be treated as one involving 
affirmative duties.
</p>
<p>The United States, with its culture of rugged individualism, reveals less sym-
pathy for imposing a duty to rescue ( or ameliorate risks to others that are not cre-
ated by the rescuer ). The example cited by Basic Questions I250 of a blind person 
walking unawares toward an open pit with the opportunity of easy rescue by an 
observer would not result in liability in the United States despite the egregiously 
immoral conduct by the observer. Although a number of North American scholars 
have decried this result and proposed schemes that would impose a duty of easy 
rescue251, U.S. law has not accepted these entreaties. Freedom, potential for self-
sacrifice if rescue duties are carried to extremes, difficulties of line drawing be-
tween easy and other rescues, problem of how to impose such a duty when there 
are multiple potential rescuers, and the implications for recognition of voluntary 
selfless rescues are claimed to justify U.S. law and are laid out by the libertarian-
leaning scholar Richard Epstein252.
</p>
<p>And yet, there are chinks in the U.S. no-duty-to-rescue armor. A number of 
specific affirmative duties are well established, some arising from identified rela-
tionships and others from undertakings. Those relationships have tended to ex-
pand over time253. Americans have a long history of responding strongly when a 
prominent instance of rescue dereliction occurs. Indeed, on a few occasions, such 
episodes have produced legislation imposing a tailored duty to rescue in similar 
circumstances254. Indeed, the lack of impetus for greater reforms in this area may 
be because non-legal influences are sufficient so that non-rescue is an infrequent 
occurrence255.

<p>II.  Fault
</p>
<p>As in Germany and Switzerland256, the standard of care in the U.S. is an objective 
one that does not take into account deficiencies of an individual. The standard 
justification, set out by Oliver Wendell Holmes, focuses not on the morality of im-
posing liability on someone who has not acted culpably but on the consequences 
to others and the administrative costs of determining each defendant&rsquo;s abilities:
</p>
<p>The standards of the law are standards of general application. The law takes 
no account of the infinite varieties of temperament, intellect, and education which 
make the internal character of a given act so different in different men. It does not 
attempt to see men as God sees them, for more than one sufficient reason. In the 
first place, the impossibility of nicely measuring a man&rsquo;s powers and limitations is 
far clearer than that of ascertaining his knowledge of law, which has been thought 
to account for what is called the presumption that every man knows the law. But 
a more satisfactory explanation is that, when men live in society, a certain aver-
age of conduct, a sacrifice of individual peculiarities going beyond a certain point, 
is necessary to the general welfare. If, for instance, a man is born hasty and awk-
ward, is always having accidents and hurting himself or his neighbors, no doubt 
his congenital defects will be allowed for in the courts of Heaven, but his slips are 
no less troublesome to his neighbors than if they sprang from guilty neglect. His 
neighbors accordingly require him, at his proper peril, to come up to their stand-
ard, and the courts which they establish decline to take his personal equation into 
account257.
</p>
<p>A.  Children
</p>
<p>The objective standard for determining fault is modified in a number of instances. 
As discussed in Basic Questions I258, the standard of care is adjusted for children. 
Two different approaches exist in the U.S., one based on rule-like provisions and 
the other based on standards. The rule-based approach exempts children under 
the age of seven from liability for negligence, while for children between seven 
and 14 a rebuttable presumption exists that they are incapable of negligence. Chil-
dren over 14 years in age are rebuttably presumed to be capable of negligence. The 
flexible approach, in place in a majority of states, employs a blended objective-
subjective standard for children. Children must exercise the care that a reason-
able child with the same intelligence, skills, and experience would exercise. Even

</p>
<p>this flexible approach invokes a rule with regard to children who are under a cer-
tain age, five-years-old in the form provided by the Third Restatement, who are 
deemed incapable of negligence259.
</p>
<p>An exception to the use of special rules for children exists when children are 
engaged in adult activities, such as driving a car or handling firearms. Children 
engaged in adult activities are subject to an unmodified reasonable care standard.
</p>
<p>B.  The physically and mentally handicapped
</p>
<p>Persons with significant and objectively verifiable physical disabilities are, like 
children, subject to a blended objective-subjective standard of care in the U.S. A 
blind person is not expected to exercise the same care as a sighted person, but 
instead must act as a reasonable person who is blind would act. In addition, the 
physically handicapped person must take into account that disability when de-
termining in which activities to engage. A blind person who drove an automobile 
into a pedestrian would be negligent for attempting to operate the automobile, 
rather than for failing to avoid colliding with the pedestrian260.
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I describes voluntary action as a pre-requisite for fault-based 
liability261. U.S. law is similar: a person whose sudden incapacitation, including 
being rendered unconscious, without being reasonably foreseeable and due to a 
physical condition cannot be held negligent262.
</p>
<p>By contrast with those with physical disabilities, persons with mental or 
emotional disabilities remain subject to the unmodified reasonable care stand-
ard. This different treatment from the physically disabled is justified predomi-
nantly on grounds of administrative cost: determining the precise capabilities of 
a person with an emotional or mental difficulty, given the wide variation of such 
conditions, would be difficult and costly both to the parties and use of judicial 
resources. Even if such conditions could be assessed, ascertaining the causal con-
nection between the disability and deficient conduct would also be problematical. 
Finally, many modest emotional harms do not affect the ability of the individual 
to exercise reasonable care.

<p>C.  Superior abilities
</p>
<p>Actors with superior abilities and knowledge must employ those traits. Once 
again, the standard is a blended one that takes into account the abilities of the de-
fendant and inquires what care a reasonable person with such superior qualities 
would exercise. Thus, a race-car driver whose superior driving abilities would en-
able her to avoid an accident in an emergency situation that an ordinary motorist 
could not might be held negligent for failure to use her superior driving abilities 
in avoiding the accident263.
</p>
<p>We note that this standard is applied outside the realm of professionals and 
the standard applicable to them. With regard to professionals, they are expected 
to exercise their superior training and experience, but the way in which that re-
quirement is imposed is different from non-professionals with superior abilities 
who engage in ordinary activities. Because juries are thought to be incapable in 
determining what constitutes reasonable care in a professional context because of 
its specialized nature, the standard of care for professionals is modified to require 
exercising the same care as is customarily exercised by other professionals in a 
similar context. The influential case of Robbins v. Footer264, explains this standard 
and the requirement of proof through expert testimony:
</p>
<p>As part of his prima facie case a malpractice plaintiff must affirmatively prove 
the relevant recognized standard of medical care exercised by other physicians 
and that the defendant departed from that standard when treating the plaintiff. 
In almost all cases the plaintiff must present expert witnesses since the technical 
complexity of the facts and issues usually prevents the jury itself from determin-
ing both the appropriate standard of care and whether the defendant&rsquo;s conduct 
conformed to that standard. In such cases there can be no finding of negligence 
without expert testimony to support it.
</p>
<p>U.S. jurisprudence does not much concern itself with deficient professionals 
and justifying the imposition of an objective standard of care on them265. First, 
much professional malpractice is not the result of unqualified practitioners but 
the unfortunate fact that humans, regardless of their training and abilities, make 
mistakes. Second, professional licensing standards go a significant way toward 
ensuring that those who are unqualified do not provide professional services. Yet, 
inevitably some will be licensed who simply cannot consistently provide adequate 
professional care, such as an Iowa neurosurgeon who operated multiple times on 
the wrong side of his patient&rsquo;s brain266. To the extent that professional disciplinary

</p>
<p>III.  Vicarious liability
A.  Introduction
We begin with some preliminary comments on terminology and justification. In 
the U.S. &raquo; auxiliary &laquo; is not a term in common usage. Rather, in U.S. law, &raquo; agents &laquo; 
are those hired by a principal to perform work on behalf of the principal. Agents 
are sub-categorized based on whether they are &raquo; employees &laquo; or &raquo; independent con-
tractors. &laquo;267 As best we understand, Erf&uuml;llungsgehilfen are equivalent to agents and 
Besorgungsgehilfe applies when there is no contractual privity between principal 
and victim268. Reference to a risk &raquo; within the principal&rsquo;s [ or other relevant actor&rsquo;s ] 
sphere &laquo; is also not a phrase employed in U.S. jurisprudence, although the concept 
expressed by the terminology is quite commonly used.
</p>
<p>Finally, a preliminary comment on the principle expressed in Basic Questions 
I that &raquo; vicarious liability may not be based on less substantial grounds than all 
other types of liability. &laquo;269 The authors would frame the standard differently: vicar-
ious liability should be imposed when the grounds for imposing it are weightier 
than the grounds for not imposing it. We do not understand the basic principles 
for liability to be the rock-bottom standard for when liability should be employed. 
Indeed, in the U.S., there is a history of extending liability ( as well as contracting 
it ) when contemporary social, cultural, economic, and technological forces justify 
it. Vicarious liability, while of long vintage270, should be employed when it is pref-
erable to not imposing liability on the principal.
</p>
<p>267 Independent contractors are non-employee persons hired to perform a task, often a specific 
task, for the hirer. Some independent contractors are agents and thereby authorized to act on 
behalf of the principal in specified respects and some are non-agent service providers. See Re-
statement ( Third ) of Agency ( 2006 ) &sect; 1.01.
</p>
<p>268 Since the seminal MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 111 N.E. 1050 ( N.Y. 1916 ), privity of contract has 
not played a role in tort cases.

270 Vicarious liability became well established in England in the 18 th century and was exported  
</p>
<p>to the United States, which adopted the English common law system. See W. P. Keeton /

</p>
<p>B.  Liability of auxiliaries
</p>
<p>As in Germany and Austria, auxiliaries retain personal liability even when the 
principal is vicariously liable for the auxiliary&rsquo;s tortious conduct271. Despite the le-
gal rule, auxiliaries are rarely subject to indemnification claims272. The classic ex-
planation for this phenomenon is that employees are largely insolvent, and suits 
against them would not be fruitful. Gary Schwartz explains several other reasons, 
including the employer&rsquo;s desire to obtain the employee&rsquo;s cooperation in defend-
ing against the tort claim, why indemnification claims are rarely made against em-
ployees by their employers273.
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I expresses concern with disproportionate and potentially ru-
inous liability being imposed on an employee if the employer is insolvent274. In 
the U.S. there is an important safety check on tort liability that ameliorates con-
cerns about this possibility. Plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyers who are compensated based on a 
contingency fee are loathe to bring suit against an individual who is not covered 
by liability insurance275. As Baker puts it: &raquo; This practical immunity does not show 
up in tort law on the books. &laquo;276 Baker also explains that liability insurance policy 
limits constitute de facto limits on the extent of liability277. While ordinarily an in-
demnification claim against an employee would be brought by the employer&rsquo;s li-
ability insurer rather than an individual victim, if the employer is insolvent, then 
the claim contemplated in Basic Questions I against the employee would have to 
be brought by the victim.
</p>
<p>271 For reasons relating to apportionment of liability, U.S. law recognizes the difference between 
the vicarious liability of a principal and the liability of one subject to joint and several liability: 
whether a vicariously liable party is liable for the entire comparative share of harm assigned 
to the agent is often stated as whether a vicariously liable party is jointly and severally liable 
with the agent. This can be misleading and lacks precision, particularly when joint and sev-
eral liability has been abrogated or modified. The vicariously liable party has not committed 
any breach of duty to the plaintiff but is held liable simply as a matter of legal imputation 
of responsibility for another&rsquo;s tortious acts. Restatement ( Third ) of Torts: Apportionment of  
Liability ( 2000 ) &sect; 13 cmt c.

<p>273  Schwartz, 69 S. Cal. L. Rev. ( 1996 ) 1739, 1764&ndash;1767. The other explanations Schwartz provides are 
maintaining good relations with the employee; the superior risk bearing capacity of the em-
ployer with regard to employee inadvertence that results in negligence; and the employer&rsquo;s 
sympathy and support for an employee who made an incorrect judgment in the course of  
attempting to further the employer&rsquo;s interests.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>Basic Questions I nevertheless endorses employee liability in the event of 
employer insolvency on the ground that as between the innocent victim and the 
wrongdoing employee, the risk of employer insolvency should fall on the latter278. 
That reasoning is persuasive, but no longer valid where comparative fault has re-
placed contributory negligence. With that reform, which occurred in the U.S. in 
the latter part of the 20th century, many doctrines that had developed and rested 
on the principle of innocent plaintiffs have been called into question and require 
re-examination279.
</p>
<p>In several other respects, including limiting vicarious liability to instances of 
employees acting within the scope of employment and the tension in imposing vi-
carious liability for intentional torts and more limited attribution rules, U.S. law is 
similar to the German / Austrian law described in Basic Questions I280.
</p>
<p>C.  Respondeat superior
</p>
<p>We wish to address two matters on this subject: 1 ) the scope of vicarious liability 
for an employer; and 2 ) the justifications for imposing liability on an employer in 
the absence of the employer&rsquo;s fault.
</p>
<p>The U.S. subscribes to the comprehensive version of respondeat superior de-
scribed in Basic Questions I281. Employers are vicariously liable for harm tortiously 
caused by an employee within the scope of employment282. The liability of the em-
ployer is, thus, strict, but liability requires fault on the part of the employee. Ad-
ditionally, an employer may be liable for its own tortious conduct &ndash; the most com-
mon form being negligence in selecting employees.
</p>
<p>The key to vicarious liability is the employer&rsquo;s  potential  control of the em-
ployee. Employers cannot actually control every act of an employee &ndash; consider an 
over-the-road truck driver. Indeed, vicarious liability in the U.S. applies even if the 
employer imposes rules that the employee ignores. An employer would be vicari-
ously liable if its truck driver speeds, in violation of company rules, if the speeding 
results in an automobile accident283.
</p>
<p>The authors are in agreement that vicarious liability cannot be justified on 
the ground that the employer has increased the risk of harm by employing an em-

</p>
<p>ployee284. We would add to the response in Basic Questions I to this justification 
the observation that increasing risk is not a basis for imposing liability generally. 
An actor is only liable for increasing risk when doing so is unreasonable, that is, 
negligent. Thus, the increased risk rationale would require employer negligence 
in hiring the employee, which fails to provide a justification for liability of the em-
ployer without fault.
</p>
<p>Yet we do think there are valid justifications for vicarious liability, which we 
can report is firmly established in U.S. law. Gary Schwartz, in a review of vicarious 
liability identifies three deterrence-based justifications for vicarious liability:
</p>
<p>First, vicarious liability gives employers strong incentives to shrewdly select 
employees and effectively supervise employees; sound and shrewd employer prac-
tices should reduce the rate of employee negligence. Second, vicarious liability 
gives employers an incentive to discipline employees who have committed neg-
ligence and thereby exposed the employer to liability. This discipline can take 
the form either of a demotion or an outright discharge; effective disciplinary pro-
grams can both remove employees capable of causing future harm and give em-
ployees an ongoing incentive to abstain from negligence. Third, insofar as the 
prospect of employee negligence cannot be fully eliminated by ambitious selec-
tion, training, supervision, and disciplining of employees, vicarious liability gives 
employers incentives to consider alternatives to employee efforts. One such alter-
native might be the mechanization of particular tasks; another might be simply 
the reduction in the overall scale of the employer&rsquo;s activities285.
</p>
<p>We would add to Schwartz&rsquo;s  justifications that vicarious liability may be jus-
tified because of the difficulties of proof of employer negligence. In large and 
complicated commercial enterprises, victims will rarely be able to demonstrate 
risk-prevention measures that the employer might have instituted to avoid or 
ameliorate the inevitable risk of human ( employee ) error. Referring back to the 
neurosurgeon who repeatedly operated on the wrong side of his patients&rsquo; heads286, 
surely there are systems that could be employed by hospitals to prevent this form 
of human error that is fortunately rare but nevertheless predictable. Yet we doubt 
that plaintiffs&rsquo; lawyers are well situated to identify those systems and prove that 
the failure to adopt them constitutes negligence.

</p>
<p>IV.  Defective things
</p>
<p>The idea of liability for defective things287 is unknown in the U.S. The anterior ques-
tion in U.S. tort law in the case of defective things would be identification of the 
actor responsible for the defective thing either in designing, constructing, main-
taining, or otherwise controlling it. That inquiry requires determining whether 
any such actor has been negligent in some relevant respect. U.S. law also does not 
recognize any special standards such as &raquo; objective carelessness &laquo; or &raquo; serious fault &laquo;.
</p>
<p>Strict liability for defective products was adopted in the U.S. in the 1960s. Yet 
the source of the idea for imposing liability for a defective product was not tort law 
but the law of contract. Sales warranties required that a product be reasonably fit 
for its intended and ordinary uses, and the failure of a product in such uses vio-
lated the expectations of consumers entering into the contract of sale or so the 
theory behind the implied warranty of merchantability went.
</p>
<p>V.  Dangerousness
</p>
<p>We would reiterate that dangerousness is not a distinct theory for liability. Negli-
gence by an actor must be shown.
</p>
<p>In one area, U.S. law has developed a head of strict liability for activities that 
are highly dangerous. That law was influenced by the English case of Rylands v. 
Fletcher288,  in which an owner hired an independent contractor to build a reser-
voir, which flooded a neighbor&rsquo;s land because of abandoned mine shafts of which 
the owner was unaware. The rationale for employing strict liability for this &raquo; non-
natural use &laquo; was purely fairness. Defendant has brought something onto his land 
for his benefit and should bear the loss if there is an escape that causes harm to 
a neighbor&rsquo;s land.
</p>
<p>Strict liability for abnormally dangerous activity in the U.S. today is justified 
based on deterrence. The doctrinal trappings of U.S. law are the same as those 
contained in the PETL289, which were modeled on the provisions in the Third Re-
statement of Torts290. The justification, which a number of law and economics 
scholars worked out in the latter part of the 20 th century was expressed by Judge 
Richard Posner in Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad Co. v. American Cyanamid Co291. Neg-

</p>
<p>ligence provides adequate incentives for safe conduct. But negligence is not ap-
plied well to activities because of the difficulties courts would have in adjudicating 
such matters, such as whether trucking was negligent because of the alternative 
method of transporting freight by ship. Hence, to both regulate the amount of 
dangerous activities that are engaged in and to provide incentives for making the 
activity safer either by developing new safety technology or relocating the activity 
to a safer location, strict liability is employed.
</p>
<p>Strict liability for abnormally dangerous activity is quite limited in the United 
States. Courts, rather than juries, are tasked with determining which activities 
qualify as abnormally dangerous. The number of activities that have been deter-
mined to be abnormally dangerous are quite few. In some jurisdictions, it is lim-
ited to blasting. In another, by legislation, it is limited to blasting and pile driv-
ing. Hazardous waste disposal, nuclear power generation and radioactive material 
processing are three other areas that some courts have classified as abnormally 
dangerous292.
</p>
<p>With regard to the matter of apportionment to others whose tortious conduct 
enables or facilitates harm caused by an abnormally dangerous activity293, U.S. law 
would permit contribution claims employing comparative responsibility as the 
basis for apportionment. However, our sense is that such situations in which a 
third party&rsquo;s negligence concurs with abnormally dangerous activity is rare. Also a 
victim&rsquo;s contributory fault also constitutes a partial defense based on comparative 
fault, or the better-termed comparative responsibility. While contributory negli-
gence was not a defense to strict liability, the adoption of comparative responsibil-
ity has changed that294.
</p>
<p>VI.  Economic capacity
</p>
<p>U.S. law has nothing remotely similar to the economic capacity principle em-
ployed with regard to children and those acting out of necessity295. U.S. law gener-
ally views the wealth of a defendant as an irrelevant consideration296.

</p>
<p>wealth of the defendant, while not bearing on liability, is often a criterion for determining the 
appropriate amount of damages that should be awarded. See Dobbs, The Law of Remedies2

</p>
<p>VII.  Insurance
</p>
<p>As with defendant wealth, the existence of liability insurance has traditionally 
been thought an irrelevant consideration in determining liability or the appro-
priate amount of compensatory damages ( many jurisdictions do not permit in-
surance for punitive damages )297. Indeed, any mention of a defendant&rsquo;s liability 
insurance is excluded from trial for the fear that a legally irrelevant matter may 
nevertheless influence jury decision making298.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, influenced by scholars such as Fleming James in the middle of the 
20 th century, some courts adopted a &raquo; loss spreading &laquo; rationale to justify strict prod-
ucts liability299. On this account, compensating the victim of a catastrophic loss would 
minimize the social cost of the harm and other product users could, in effect, be taxed 
for the costs of that compensation. The idea is based on the principle of insurance, 
albeit imposed by law300. From this account, the matter of whether the defendant 
was or could have insured became a criterion for imposing strict products liability301.
</p>
<p>Another area in which the presence of liability insurance played a decisive role 
was in the breakdown of family immunities. At first cut, it might seem pointless for 
one member of an intact family to sue another member. U.S. law had, for many years, 
employed a family immunity doctrine that prevented such suits ( whether they made 
sense or not ) on the grounds of family harmony. However, many courts in recent 
years have removed that immunity, influenced by the availability of liability insur-
ance ( auto or homeowners ) that would cover any intra-family liabilities. Finally, we 
would observe in response to &sect; 829 BGB and &sect; 1310 ABGB, which take into account 
the existence of liability insurance302, such a rule may, perversely, influence children 
or those with mental illness to avoid insuring themselves. We would also observe 
that many large enterprises choose to self-insure and others only have insurance 
for liabilities above a certain amount, self insuring for all less than the designated 
threshold.

( 2005 ) 409, 454 and FN 224.
</p>
<p>298 See Federal Rules of Evidence ( Fed. R. Evid.) 411 ( &raquo; Evidence that a person was or was not in-
sured against liability is not admissible to prove whether the person acted negligently or oth-
erwise wrongfully. But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as proving 
a witness&rsquo;s bias or prejudice or proving agency, ownership, or control. &laquo; ).
</p>
<p>299 See F. Fleming, Jr., Products Liability, 34 Tex. L. Rev. ( 1956 ) 44. Guido Calabresi, as well, advocated 
loss spreading as a means to reduce social cost. See Calabresi, Accidents 51&ndash;54.

<p>VIII.  Risk communities
</p>
<p>We discuss automobile accidents separately from product accidents for purposes 
of the idea of a risk community. With regard to products, often there is market dif-
ferentiation that results in some purchasing safer products while others purchase 
more risky versions of the same product. Automobiles are an excellent example 
of this with large luxury products providing more protection and greater safety 
technology than smaller economy vehicles. Thus, the Widmer vision303 of a risk 
community does not operate in practice in some product markets. Moreover, even 
in product markets with generic, equal risk products, each consumer will pay the 
same premium for protection from defect-caused injury. Yet, those with larger in-
comes would be provided greater protection than those with smaller incomes or 
the retired or unemployed. Thus implementing a product risk community could 
result in the less wealthy subsidizing the more wealthy. Private insurance would 
not entail such subsidies.
</p>
<p>With regard to automobile accidents, third-party liability insurance poses 
similar cross-subsidy concerns. The wealthy will recover more when injured than 
the poor, yet pay no more in insurance premiums on that account. In addition li-
ability insurance is an expensive way, even if strict liability is employed, to provide 
compensation304. Instead, mandatory first-party insurance would provide com-
pensation more efficiently and tailored to the needs of each insured who could 
obtain sufficient coverage to replace his or her lost income due to injury. More-
over, first-party insurance is attractive with regard to motorists because deterrence 
plays a diminished role in this context where deficient driving behavior poses not 
only risks to others but also to the driver him- or herself. Efforts to enact legisla-
tion providing for no-fault automobile insurance had modest success in the U.S. 
in the 1970s, but have stalled in subsequent years largely because of political op-
position from trial lawyers305.

ance ); G. Priest, The Current Insurance Crisis and Modern Tort Law, 96 Yale L.J. ( 1987 ) 1521, 1588

</p>
<p>IX.  Burden shifting and greater liability
</p>
<p>We would make explicitly a point that is implicit in the discussion of burden shift-
ing in Basic Questions I306. Burden shifting may be adopted not to impose a higher 
standard of liability but to extract evidence from the defendant who otherwise has 
no incentive to provide any evidence in its control that bears on fault. In addition, 
burden shifting may be used with regard to elements other than fault for the same 
purpose or because of fairness in imposing the risk of unavailable evidence on the 
culpable party rather than on the innocent victim307.
</p>
<p>X.  A blended standard
</p>
<p>Our sense is that most U.S. observers would align themselves with Johann Neeth-
ling308 and assert that fault-based liability and strict liability for abnormally dan-
gerous activity are two distinct bases for liability. Abnormally dangerous activity is, 
as explained above, a relatively minor aspect of U.S. tort law. We are hard pressed 
to identify intermediate positions between these two established bases for liabil-
ity. Moreover, we are inclined to resist the claim that requiring greater care when 
the risk is greater entails a deviation from fault-based liability. The standard of 
care is one of reasonableness, and when there is greater risk, more care would be 
exercised based on this reasonableness standard. The Learned-Hand formula, simi-
larly, while remaining static would call for assuming a higher degree of care when 
the risk posed increases. This is fault-based liability not a hybrid between fault 
and strict liability, or so most U.S. courts would reason309.

<p>XI.  Enterprise liability
</p>
<p>Apart from products liability, there is very little enterprise liability in the U.S.310 
The idea of liability for a defect in a building or enterprise is unknown in the U.S. 
It is the case that Greg Keating, a prominent U.S. torts scholar, has been a vigorous 
advocate for enterprise liability and claims to find significant strains of enterprise 
liability in modern tort law, but he is a distinct minority in that view311.
</p>
<p>XII.  Products liability
</p>
<p>Strict products liability developed in the U.S. in the 1960s in the midst of a pro-
gressive era when society was looking to have government provide stronger safety 
nets to ameliorate the risks confronted by Americans over their life cycle. More-
over, strict products liability developed not in place of fault-based liability but in 
place of substantial pockets of no liability because of courts&rsquo; reluctance to apply a 
full-throated negligence standard to product manufacturers312. No &ndash; or at least less 
</p>
<p>310 Thus, we would resist the characterization in Basic Questions I, that the U.S. is part of a strong 
trend toward &raquo; more stringent damage liability for entrepreneurs &laquo; ( no 6 / 192 ). Gary Schwartz, 
in an article cited in Basic Questions I, convincingly refutes George Priest&rsquo;s claims of the rise 
of Enterprise Liability. See G.T. Schwartz, The Beginning and the Possible End of the Rise of 
Modern American Tort Law, 26 Ga. L. Rev. ( 1992 ) 601. Since Schwartz&rsquo;s article the retreat from 
strict liability for products has continued such that there is quite little strict remaining in 
products liability. See below no 6 / 166; G.G. Howells / M. Mildred, Is European Products Liability

</p>
<p>than full &ndash; liability better reflected that era because of difficulties of proof faced by 
victims in demonstrating seller fault and because of impediments to warranty lia-
bility313. Moreover, the focus of strict products liability was on products that failed 
dramatically in the course of their ordinary use: soda bottles that exploded314; 
lathes that failed to hold stock that was locked in place315; and lawn furniture that 
had such sharp hidden pieces as to amputate the tip of a user&rsquo;s finger316. To be 
sure, the strict products liability that was adopted rested in part on loss spreading 
and enterprise liability rationales, but a variety of policies were argued to support 
this development. The &raquo; strict &laquo; in strict products liability was borrowed from sales 
law and its implied warranty of merchantability not any tort doctrine that sup-
ported strict liability being applied to product manufacturers.
</p>
<p>Despite courts&rsquo; dalliance with finding something strict to apply to design de-
fects and warnings, U.S. law today largely employs a negligence standard to deter-
mine whether such a defect exists317. While strict liability does exist for manufac-
turing defects and products that fail dramatically to perform safely in the ordinary 
course of their use, both of those areas might be justified on the ground of the dif-
ficulties of proof of negligence confronted by injured victims.
</p>
<p>XIII.  Comparative responsibility
</p>

317 The apogee of this dalliance occurred in Beshada v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., 447 A.2d 539 
</p>
<p>( New Jersey 1982 ). The New Jersey Supreme court declared irrelevant the defendants&rsquo; claims 
that the dangers of asbestos were not foreseeable at the time their products had been manufac-
tured. Foreseeability of risk, the court ruled, was irrelevant to strict products liability. Within 
18 months, the court backtracked, providing a state of the art defense to a drug manufacturer 
who alleged that the risks of its drug were unknown at the time plaintiff used it. See Feldman v. 
Lederle Labs, 479 A.2d 374 ( New Jersey 1984 ). The Third Restatement requires that risks be fore-
seeable ( and proved by plaintiff ) for both warning and design defects. See Restatement ( Third ) 
of Torts: Products Liability ( 1998 ) &sect; 2( b )-( c ).

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>We should add that the majority of states adopting a comparative responsibility 
scheme have employed what is known as a &raquo; modified &laquo; type, such that a plaintiff 
who is more than 50 % at fault is barred from recovery319.
</p>
<p>We are skeptical of the claim, often made by law and economics scholars, and 
also stated in Basic Questions I, that comparative responsibility serves deterrence 
purposes320. According to this account, tort law must provide incentives for poten-
tial victims to avoid risky conduct that threatens themselves. As we explain above, 
particularly with regard to personal injury, there are quite substantial incentives 
already in place that deter behavior creating risk to self321. Indeed, in many cases 
involving momentary inadvertence by individuals, an aspect of the human condi-
tion that law may not have much sway with, we are inclined to think that imposing 
full liability on the negligent injurer, especially if an enterprise, would do more 
for deterrence than imposing partial liability on the victim. Thus, our view is that 
the reason for reducing recovery due to victim negligence is related to fairness 
and the idea that when two persons are each negligent in causing injury, liability 
should be shared between them, rather than visited entirely on one or the other 
of the persons.
</p>
<p>We are a bit confused about the discussion in Basic Questions I of the applica-
tion of the principle of responsibility with regard to plaintiff fault322. Basic Ques-
tions I suggests that only victim conduct that would make the victim liable to a 
third party constitutes comparative responsibility323. Much that might constitute 
fault by a victim poses risks only to the victim and not to third parties. For exam-
ple, a homeowner who carelessly climbs a ladder creates risks only to the home-
owner. If apportionment were limited to those instances when a victim&rsquo;s unrea-
sonable conduct also poses risk to third parties, it would be far more constrained 
than is the practice in the U.S. To be sure, some faulty conduct may pose threats 
both to the self and others, as in the case of careless driving, and for such a plain-
tiff a larger apportionment of comparative responsibility is justified based on hav-
ing created risks to both self and others324.
</p>
<p>We are even more bemused by the differentiation theory325, which has no 
counterpart in the U.S. If we understand it correctly, it seems nonsensical to in-
sist that because the plaintiff always plays a causal role, some liability must be 
</p>
<p>plete bar to recovery. See Restatement ( Third ) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability ( 2000 ) &sect; 7

</p>
<p>apportioned to him, even if his conduct is non-culpable. Liability is not imposed 
for non-tortious conduct by injurers, and we cannot understand the claim why it 
should be different for victims. Yes, it is true that tort law declines to shift losses 
that are not tortiously caused, but it does so not so that the loss is imposed on 
the victim but rather because there is no good reason to shift the loss326. Tort law 
has nothing to say about other sources of compensation that may be available to 
a victim, including disability or health insurance, which can serve to shift the vic-
tim&rsquo;s loss.
</p>
<p>We concur that conduct that poses risks only to oneself is, outside the torts 
context, not culpable327. Freedom with regard to one&rsquo;s own affairs justifies such 
assessments. However, when conduct that is risky only to oneself concurs with 
the tortious conduct of another, the other has a strong claim that the victim&rsquo;s 
risky conduct should be taken into account in determining liability. That claim is 
based both on fairness and, in the minds of law and economics scholars, on de-
terrence328. All other things being equal, behavior that only poses risk to oneself 
might be adjudged comparatively less seriously than an actor&rsquo;s conduct posing 
risk to others. Nevertheless, U.S. law reasons very differently from that described 
in Basic Questions I about Austro-Germanic law329. Assuming that a victim&rsquo;s con-
duct meets the threshold of unreasonably posing risks ( and we assume for this 
discussion only to the victim ), then the lesser culpability of the victim would be 
reflected in an apportionment of the degree of fault ( and thereby in responsibility 
for the costs of the harm ) to the victim and concomitantly with greater compara-
tive responsibility ( and liability for the harm ) being placed on the defendant.
</p>
<p>Before the advent of comparative responsibility, victim behavior was judged 
more leniently with regard to whether it was unreasonable. That differential stand-
ard was justified because of the inequity of contributory negligence, which im-
posed the costs of an accident entirely on one of two faulty behaving parties. With 
the adoption of comparative responsibility, that principle has been replaced with 
the rule that &raquo; Plaintiff&rsquo;s negligence is defined by the applicable standard for a de-
fendant&rsquo;s negligence. &laquo;330 Ameliorative doctrines, such as last clear chance, which 
negated victim fault when the injurer had the last clear chance to avoid the acci-
dent, have also been eliminated331.
</p>
<p>326 Thus, we would resist the idea that there is a &raquo; general rule for risk-bearing on the part of the 
victim &laquo;. Basic Questions I, no 6 / 213. Rather we would state it as there is a &raquo; rule that liability is 
not imposed unless an injurer satisfies the elements for tort liability &laquo;.
</p>
<p>327 We note that frequently the same conduct that risks injury to oneself also poses risks to others.
328 We have already expressed skepticism about that claim with regard to deterring behavior that 
</p>
<p>risks personal injury to oneself, above no 6 / 168.

<p> Part 7 Limitations on liability
</p>
<p>I.  Proximate cause or scope of liability
</p>
<p>We would wholeheartedly endorse, from a U.S. perspective, the need for an addi-
tional limiting element as an aspect of tort liability because of the scope that em-
ploying an unadorned sine qua non test would produce. We also concur that this 
limitation is, unlike factual causation, a normative inquiry. We would also plead 
guilty, on behalf of historical tort law in the U.S., of confusion borne of using &raquo; le-
gal cause &laquo; as an umbrella term to include both factual causation and limitations 
on liability332. Indeed, with the more popular term &raquo; proximate cause &laquo; used to vari-
ously mean both cause and limitations, just factual cause, or just limitations of li-
ability, much confusion has been spawned in U.S. tort law333. The confusion is not 
only a result of using the same terms to mean different things but also of failing 
to clearly distinguish the largely objective determination of factual cause from the 
normative assessment of how far to trace defendant&rsquo;s liability334.
</p>
<p>We can also report hopefully on the Third Restatement&rsquo;s effort to repair this 
confusion. Like the PETL, the Restatement consciously separates factual causa-
tion from liability limitations335. Moreover, it adopts entirely new terminology, re-
jecting legal cause and proximate cause and, instead adopting factual cause and 
scope of liability to describe these two elements. Whether the Third Restatement 
can dislodge traditional and entrenched usage remains an open question in the 
U.S. right now336.
</p>
<p>332 The first two Restatements of Torts employed &raquo; legal cause &laquo;, requiring that &raquo; the negligence of 
the actor be a legal cause of the other&rsquo;s harm &laquo;. Restatement ( Second ) of Torts ( 1965 ) &sect; 430; Re-
statement of Torts ( 1934 ) &sect; 430. The Restatements&rsquo; terminology never gained popular support 
and instead &raquo; proximate cause &laquo; was often used, at times, to express both factual cause and li-
ability limitations. See Dobbs, The Law of Torts &sect; 167, at 408 ( &raquo; Courts often lump the two issues 
together under the rubric of &rsaquo;proximate cause.&lsaquo; &laquo; ).

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>We should finally explain one anomaly in U.S. law with regard to limitations on 
liability. Basic Questions I reflects the traditional view that once a faulty act that 
violates a duty occurs, &raquo; the violation does not need to relate to the further conse-
quences. &laquo;337 In perhaps the most famous tort case in the U.S. of all time, Palsgraf 
v. Long Island Railroad Co.338, Judge Cardozo insisted that duty and negligence were 
limited by the harms that could be foreseen at the time of the negligent act. &raquo; [ N ]
egligence in the air, so to speak, will not do. &laquo;339 Thus, the defendant railroad was 
not liable for harm to the plaintiff who had been standing on a railroad platform, 
some distance from the tracks. Two employees of the defendant assisted a passen-
ger who was hurriedly attempting to board a train. During that time, the passen-
ger dropped a small package wrapped in newspaper that contained fireworks. The 
fireworks exploded when the package hit the ground. Plaintiff was injured when 
shock waves from the blast caused a scale where plaintiff was waiting to fall on her.
</p>
<p>According to Cardozo, while the risk of harm to the embarking passenger or 
perhaps others in the immediate vicinity would support duty and breach by the 
railroad employees as to them, the acts were not a wrong in relation to the plain-
tiff. Thus, Cardozo declared, the &raquo; law of causation, remote or proximate &laquo;340 was not 
involved in the case because there was no duty to the plaintiff. In Cardozo&rsquo;s con-
ceptualization, then, duty is relational rather than act based.
</p>
<p>Palsgraf had two important aspects to it. First, it shifted much of what had 
been dealt with as scope of liability &ndash; the matter of plaintiff foreseeability &ndash; to the 
duty inquiry, requiring an assessment of which persons were foreseeably at risk 
of harm at the time of the defendant&rsquo;s act. Foreseeability, of course, is one of the 
tests commonly employed for scope of liability. The practical importance of that 
change in the U.S. is that it shifted the determination of scope of liability from the 
jury ( where it is treated as a factual matter341 and therefore for jury determination ) 
to the court where duty is treated as a matter of law.
</p>
<p>By contrast with Cardozo, Judge Andrews, dissenting, asserted duty arises from 
acts that create risk and such a duty is owed &raquo; to the world at large. &laquo;342 The Andrews 
expansive vision of duty then left to scope of liability ( then, proximate cause ) the 
question of how far liability would extend.

<p>Many contemporary U.S. observers believe that Palsgraf&rsquo;s influence has largely 
faded and while an important historical matter, it is not of contemporary signifi-
cance. A recent article finds more of Palsgraf than many of those observers appre-
ciate. The author writes that &raquo; As to the proper doctrinal home for plaintiff-foresee-
ability, Cardozo has undoubtedly prevailed &hellip; a clear majority of jurisdictions state 
that duty is the proper home for plaintiff-foreseeability &hellip; &laquo;343.
</p>
<p>II.  &raquo; Breaking the causal chain &laquo;
</p>
<p>Personally, we wholeheartedly concur with Basic Questions I&rsquo;s assessment of the 
oft-expressed idea that an intervening act breaks the causal chain connecting de-
fendant&rsquo;s tortious act and the plaintiff&rsquo;s harm344. Nevertheless, we must report 
that there is quite a bit of that language masquerading as analysis in U.S. court 
decisions. As Basic Questions I correctly explains, this idea of severing the causal 
chain has nothing to do with factual causation and instead addresses the matter 
of scope of liability. The role of an intervening act, therefore, should be addressed 
and analyzed as the liability-limiting doctrine it is, rather than by invoking the 
metaphysics of breaking causal chains345.
</p>
<p>III.  The standard for determining scope of liability
</p>
<p>We are unable to assess the theory of adequacy in Basic Questions I346. Perhaps be-
cause it is unfamiliar or perhaps because of the variations that exist preventing a 
more concrete explanation of its content, we are unable to comprehend what this 
theory entails. As to remote damage being excluded, the explanation that it was 
not controlled by the actor is unpersuasive to U.S. sensibilities. An individual who 
fails adequately to secure a dangerous firearm loses control over it once a third 
person obtains possession because of the lack of security, but that loss of control 
would not be a recognized ground for excluding the owner&rsquo;s liability. Similarly, we 
are unpersuaded by the deterrence argument. Deterrence theory would counsel 
in favor of liability if an actor creates some foreseeable risk through a negligent

<p>act, but other, unforeseeable harm occurs. Indeed, a full-throated commitment to 
deterrence would obviate the need for any scope of liability limitation, as once an 
actor has been found to have created excessive risk, liability is appropriate regard-
less of the connection to the harm that ensues347.
</p>
<p>We think that what Basic Questions I identifies as the protective purpose the-
ory348 is equivalent to the U.S. harm-within-the-risk rule. This &raquo; HWR &laquo; rule em-
ployed to limit liability is one of several that exist and are employed in U.S. juris-
dictions today349. HWR asks whether the risk that resulted in the plaintiff&rsquo;s harm 
is among the risks that were the basis for holding the defendant liable350. This 
limitation can be employed for negligence and strict liability torts, as it focuses on 
risks rather than faulty conduct. Thus, if strict liability applies to the storage of dy-
namite, an actor engaged in such conduct would not be liable for harm occurring 
if a package of dynamite fell on another person causing a broken toe. Dynamite 
falling on persons is not a risk included in the reason for holding those who store 
dynamite strictly liable.
</p>
<p>This rule, characterized in different terms, is employed to limit liability for 
violating statutory safety provisions when such violations result in harm. Thus for 
liability to be imposed, the harm must be among those that the statutory provi-
sion was designed to prevent and the victim must be in the class of persons that 
were to be benefitted by the safety provision351. Application in the context of spe-
cific safety statutes is considerably easier because of the narrower focus of safety 
statues by comparison to the negligence cause of action, which potentially en-
compasses all conduct posing risks to others.
</p>
<p>IV.   Lawful alternative conduct: factual cause or scope 
of liability ?
</p>
<p>Addressing the hypothetical of the car driver overtaking a cyclist352, we see no dif-
ficulty with resolving that case on the grounds of factual cause. To ask the coun-
ter-factual inquiry required for factual case &ndash; would the outcome be different if

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>the tortious conduct353 had not occurred ? &ndash; the answer is plainly no. Since the tor-
tious conduct was leaving insufficient space and since even if the driver had left 
sufficient space the same harm would have occurred, the driver&rsquo;s tort is not a fac-
tual cause of the harm. Thus, the car driver is not liable because factual cause is 
absent &ndash; it would have happened anyway. The outcome would be the same in the 
informed consent hypothetical also contained in Basic Questions I354.
</p>
<p>While it is true, as Basic Questions I explains355, that in both of these hypo-
theticals and more generally in this class of cases that the other event is merely 
hypothetical and did not occur, we do not think that fact is of consequence. Neces-
sary for any factual causal inquiry is a counter-factual hypothetical inquiry: what 
would have happened in the world if the defendant had not engaged in the tor-
tious conduct ?356 Thus, the fact that the alternative force that would also produce 
the harm is merely hypothetical is merely a consequence of the necessity of the 
causal inquiry and not an objection to the no-cause conclusion. Thus, U.S. law and 
analysis would align itself with the &raquo; great majority &laquo; identified in Basic Questions 
I357. Indeed, U.S. lawyers would have difficulty understanding &raquo; the doubtless still 
prevailing view. &laquo;358
</p>
<p>With regard to the concern for deterrence expressed in Basic Questions I 
about the informed consent case, there is an alternative and theoretically more 
satisfying approach than holding the physician liable for harm that she did not 
cause. Rather, what the physician deprived her patient of was an autonomy inter-
est in having the opportunity to make an informed assessment of whether to pur-
sue the medical intervention, as stated in Basic Questions I359. If courts recognized 
that interest as compensable, then liability could be imposed and would be deter-
mined based on the harm caused rather than on other harm not caused360.
</p>
<p>353 We should explain that it is the tortious conduct rather than the entirety of the actor&rsquo;s conduct 
that must be removed in conducting the counter-factual inquiry. &raquo; Tortious conduct must be 
a factual cause of harm for liability to be imposed &laquo;. Restatement ( Third ) of Torts: Liability for

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>In the view of these authors, there is also no cause to adopt a proportional li-
ability scheme in the lawful alternative cause situation. A basic principle of tort 
law is that tortfeasors are not liable for harm that they have not caused. Lawful al-
ternative cause is merely another way of analyzing factual causation, and does not 
provide a reason to abandon this basic principle.
</p>
<p>V.  Intervening acts
</p>
<p>There is much in U.S. tort law that exempts a tortfeasor from liability when an in-
tentional intervening act by a third party is also a factual cause of the harm. Much 
of this law relies on conclusory invocations of &raquo; superseding causes &laquo; and &raquo; breaking 
the chain of causation &laquo;. A provision in the Second Restatement of Torts has also 
frequently been invoked and quoted by courts:
</p>
<p>There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him 
from causing physical harm to another unless:
</p>
<p>a. a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes 
a duty upon the actor to control the third person&rsquo;s conduct; or
</p>
<p>b. a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to the 
other a right to protection361.
</p>
<p>Courts invoking this provision, however, fail to appreciate that it was addressing 
the matter of affirmative duties &ndash; the obligation to protect another from risks cre-
ated solely by the third person and that the provision was not addressed to the 
circumstance when a tortfeasor had also contributed to the risk of harm to the 
victim. The Third Restatement of Torts attempts to correct misuse of section 315: 
&raquo; The conduct of a defendant can lack reasonable care insofar as it foreseeably 
combines with or permits the improper conduct of the plaintiff or a third party. &laquo;362
</p>
<p>We, thus, are not attracted to the reasoning described in Basic Questions I 
that liability should not be imposed because of the independent decision of a 
third party that produced the harm363. First, we would observe that, notwithstand-
ing the independent decision, the tortfeasor&rsquo;s wrongful act also produced the 
harm. Second, as a matter of fairness, we cannot understand why an actor who 
negligently gives a firearm to an unqualified individual who then fires it under in-
appropriate circumstances should be absolved of liability and the harm left to fall 
on the victim.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Thus, we find ourselves in accord with Basic Questions I&rsquo;s suggestion that one 
must look to the &raquo; protective purpose of the behavioral rule violated &laquo;364. If the rea-
son the firearm owner was negligent in the above hypothetical was the risk that an 
unqualified person would not safely use the firearm, exempting the owner from 
liability when precisely that event occurs seems perverse. The Third Restatement 
reflects these views in its treatment of scope of liability providing that when inde-
pendent acts also are a cause, &raquo; an actor&rsquo;s liability is limited to those harms that 
result from the risks that made the actor&rsquo;s conduct tortious &laquo; 365. The Restatement 
also observes that with much better tools for apportioning liability, that is, on a 
comparative responsibility basis, there is reduced necessity for the all or nothing 
approach of exemption that had previously held substantial sway. It also acknowl-
edges that the scope of liability rule for intervening acts is the same as the general 
scope of liability rule, thereby revealing that there is nothing specially significant 
about the intervention of a third party366.
</p>
<p>VI.  Limits on liability
</p>
<p>No limits on liability for those held strictly liable exist in the U.S. Arguments in 
favor of such limits on similar grounds to those identified in Basic Questions I367 
have been expressed by scholars who invoke the limited damages available in no-
fault based workers&rsquo; compensation368. U.S. courts, perhaps reflecting their view 
about the appropriate scope of common law courts, have not responded to these 
entreaties.
</p>
<p>However, tort reform legislative efforts in the U.S. have resulted in limiting 
damages recovery in the U.S. This legislation does not address the theoretical ar-
guments for limited liability in exchange for lesser liability standards but instead 
stand on the pragmatic ground of reducing liability in areas where there is a per-
ceived crisis in the costs of liability insurance. Limits on recovery of non-pecuni-
ary damages in medical malpractice cases is the most common such legislation369.

<p>In the end, whether limits on damages will make liability insurance more af-
fordable and the extent to which such limits will reduce insurance premiums is 
an empirical matter. The question has been the subject of considerable research 
in the U.S. in an effort to determine whether damages reform has ameliorated 
the high cost of medical malpractice insurance. A recent review of 16 studies that 
addressed the question concluded that because of various methodologies em-
ployed, flaws in study design and different outcomes, no strong conclusion could 
be reached about the relationship between capping damages and medical mal-
practice insurance premiums370.

<p> Part 8 Compensation of damage371
</p>
<p>In the U.S., the theory of compensation is the same as expressed in Basic Ques-
tions I372; a tortfeasor should restore the victim to the state that existed prior to 
the damaging event373. The generality of the theory and pragmatic impediments to 
implement the theory create a host of difficult and interesting issues in tort com-
pensation in the U.S.374 As well, damages vary depending on the type of harm, per-
sonal injury, reputational, economic loss, etc, suffered by the victim375.
</p>
<p>I.  Lump sum or periodic payments
</p>
<p>In the U.S., future losses have been awarded as a lump sum, reflecting the admin-
istrative efficiency of doing so as well as to provide encouragement for the victim 
to move on with his or her life376. That is also true for victims who are at risk of 
suffering additional injury in the future &ndash; they must recover damages for the an-
ticipated injuries in the initial action377. The disadvantage, of course, is that deter-
mining future losses can be problematic. With regard to lost profits, courts often 
permit juries to decide the appropriate amount of damages based on evidence 
that is less robust than is ordinarily required as to what the future earnings of the 
plaintiff would have been because of the difficulties of proof. On the other hand, 
a minority of jurisdictions in the U.S. employ a categorical rule prohibiting a new

which the court allowed recovery for future injury based on the probability such future harm 
would occur even if below the threshold preponderance standard of proof.

<p>business from recovering future lost profits because of the speculative nature of 
the prospects of such a new venture378.
</p>
<p>The strong default in the U.S. is for the &raquo; single-judgment rule &laquo;, which requires 
all damages for a tortious injury to be recovered in one action. However, in the 
1970s, a handful of jurisdictions enacted periodic payment statutes that provide 
for payments to be made over time and for the payments to cease when the need, 
such as the death of the victim, expired. Such statutes were limited to medical 
malpractice cases, influenced by the perceived crisis in medical liability insurance 
policies, and have not expanded to other tort areas or additional jurisdictions379.
</p>
<p>II. Reduction of Damages
</p>
<p>In the U.S., there is no counterpart to the reduction clauses discussed in Basic 
Questions I380. Because such a provision is unknown, there is no discussion of 
such a provision in tort law scholarship of which we are aware. A defendant sub-
ject to a ruinous judgment would be free to seek relief in a bankruptcy court, al-
though judgments for intentional torts are not eligible for discharge. As discussed 
above, plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyers infrequently seek execution from individuals who have 
no insurance or whose liability insurance is inadequate to cover the full liability381.
</p>
<p>Perhaps because of these practical limitations on ruinous liability in the U.S., 
we do not find persuasive the arguments for adoption of such a reduction clause. 
While a large judgment may prove ruinous to a culpable defendant, failing to re-
cover damages after a significant injury can also prove highly detrimental to the 
victim. Basic Questions I argues that reduction &raquo; can leave the tortfeasor with more 
than just the minimum subsistence level and thus allow him a certain possibility 
of development. &laquo;382 That argument appears to us to be one for unadorned wealth 
shifting &ndash; money provided to those who are poor can help them more than leaving 
the money with someone wealthier. Such an argument, if accepted, might entitle 
a victim of a catastrophic loss to seek payment from another even though that in-
dividual is not liable in tort for the loss.

<p> Part 9 Prescription of compensation claims
</p>
<p>An American lawyer would concur with much of what is said by way of introduc-
tion to the prescription of claims ( statutes of limitations in the U.S. legal lexicon ) 
in Basic Questions I383. That U.S. lawyer might resist the idea that prescription is 
designed to prevent unfounded claims, as there is no evidence of which we are 
aware that there is a relationship between the delay in filing and the merits of 
the action. Prescription does serve the dual purpose of preventing litigation of a 
case with stale or absent evidence and providing repose to potential defendants 
once the period has expired for bringing suit. The penalty imposed on a victim in 
the event of missing the prescribed time is particularly harsh &ndash; the claim is lost. 
Such a penalty is justified on the grounds of deterrence &ndash; providing incentives for 
promptly filing suit &ndash; and reducing the transactional costs that would otherwise 
exist with a laches rule that inquired in every case into whether evidence in the 
case had been compromised by plaintiff&rsquo;s delay in filing suit. If the incentives pro-
vided by prescription rules are successful, the penalty for running afoul of them 
will infrequently be invoked. Unlike the suggestion in Basic Questions I that pub-
lic interests are involved384, prescription is viewed in the U.S. as essentially only a 
balancing of private rights and administrative costs.

<p>We would add that while generally the idea that delays in the initiation of 
suit will disadvantage the defendant because of lost or deteriorated evidence that 
would assist the defendant in mounting a defense, that is not universally the case. 
In several mass toxic torts in the U.S. in recent decades, the critical question has 
been causation &ndash; whether the defendant&rsquo;s drug or medical device causes certain 
diseases in the human species. In two notable cases, litigation began at a time 
when the evidence was quite thin with regard to that causation question. In the 
early stages of the litigation, plaintiffs met with some success in their claims, rely-
ing on what evidence there was that the drugs or devices caused disease. However, 
the litigation &raquo; drove science &laquo; and additional investigation resulted in more robust 
evidence of causation, including a number of epidemiologic studies. In both cases, 
one involving a drug for morning sickness in pregnant women385 and the other sili-
cone gel breast implants386, the evidence tended to exonerate the suspected agent, 
which eventually resulted in courts ruling as a matter of law against plaintiffs. The

</p>
<p>point of these cases can be generalized: sometimes evidence, typically scientific 
evidence, with regard to a claim becomes better with the passage of time387.
</p>
<p>The idea that it would be unfair to impose on heirs the burden of long-unas-
serted claims388 is dealt with in the U.S. by limiting claims against the decedent&rsquo;s 
estate and barring all unasserted claims once the estate is wrapped up and distrib-
uted to heirs, all unasserted claims are barred. Stale claims may not just be in the 
form of lawsuits but other debts or obligations of the decedent. The probate pro-
cess is designed to resolve these claims in timely fashion before distribution of the 
remainder of the decedent&rsquo;s assets. A similar process exists when a corporation 
liquidates its assets, distributes them to shareholders, and dissolves389.
</p>
<p>I.  Prescription periods
</p>
<p>U.S. law is unlike Austrian law with its overarching ( and lengthy ) prescription pe-
riod390 and more like that described for German and Swiss law, although accrual 
of the claim is different in the U.S. Distinct prescription periods are specified for 
different types of claims, typically for negligence claims it is two years, although 
in different jurisdictions it may range from one to three years391. Generally, a claim 
accrues and the prescription period begins to run, as in Austria392, upon the occur-
rence of the last event that would enable the victim to bring an action, which in 
tort cases is the occurrence of injury or harm393. The tortious act by the defendant 
must precede harm to the plaintiff, since an act cannot be a cause of harm that 
precedes the act.
</p>
<p>Because in some cases, especially disease cases in which the plaintiff may not 
know of the harm until it clinically manifests itself or of the cause of the disease 
or of the defendant&rsquo;s role in connection with the cause of the disease, most U.S. 
courts or state legislatures have adopted discovery rules that delay the running 
of the prescription clock394, similar to the accrual rules in Germany and Switzer-

<p>land395. Discovery rules in the U.S. specify different matter of which the victim 
must have knowledge ( or reasonably could have had knowledge ): 1 ) knowledge of  
the existence of disease; 2 ) defendant&rsquo;s tortious conduct; and 3 ) the causal connec-
tion between the defendant&rsquo;s tortious conduct and the disease396.
</p>
<p>In addition to statutes of limitations, many U.S. jurisdictions employ statutes 
of repose for particular types of claims397. Statutes of repose, like the long pre-
scription periods provided in German and Swiss law, start to run with an act other 
than harm to the victim, often when the defendant&rsquo;s tortious actions are complete. 
Thus statutes of repose for products liability actions provide a period of time from 
which the product is first sold by the defendant. Typically, the period prescribed 
in repose statutes is considerably shorter than the long prescription period in 
Austria: they tend to cluster around 8&ndash;12 years, comparable to Switzerland. Stat-
utes of repose are quite popular for claims about negligent construction of real 
property. These statutes of repose can bar a tort claim before the victim is injured 
by the defendant&rsquo;s conduct and therefore before a claim has arisen upon which 
the plaintiff is able to sue398.
</p>
<p>II.  Barring claims before they accrue
</p>
<p>Although we are unfamiliar with the details of Austrian law and the claims with 
regard to the long prescription period barring claims before they have accrued, we 
find the policy analysis in Basic Questions I compelling399. Prescription periods 
that cut off claims before they accrue have been heavily criticized, the most enter-
taining being that of Judge Frank in Dincher v. Marlin Firearms Co.400,
</p>
<p>&raquo; Except in topsy-turvy land you can&rsquo;t die before you are conceived, or be di-
vorced before ever you marry, or harvest a crop never planted, or burn down a 
house never built, or miss a train running on a non-existent railroad. For substan-
tially similar reasons, it has always heretofore been accepted, as a sort of legal &rsaquo;ax-
iom&lsaquo;, that a statute of limitations does not begin to run against a cause of action 
before that cause of action exists, that is, before a judicial remedy is available to 
the plaintiff. &laquo;

</p>
<p>We can, however, explain that statutes of repose were enacted by state legisla-
tures at the instigation of affected groups &ndash; product manufacturers, home build-
ers, and physicians, for example &ndash; to respond to perceptions that the liability im-
posed on them and consequently the insurance premiums they were required to 
pay were excessive. Such legislation is, as Basic Questions I observes, &raquo; one-sided 
and thus inappropriate &laquo;401.

<p>Part 1  The law of damages within the system for 
protection of rights and legal interests
</p>
<p>I.  Overview
</p>
<p>The Japanese legal system provides for the protection of subjective rights, such as 
rights to property or personality rights. However, it is questionable what &raquo; provid-
ing for legal protection &laquo; means. This question arises in particular when a right is 
infringed.
</p>
<p>A.  Infringement by the person with the right
</p>
<p>The first case to be considered is the case of someone infringing his own legal 
goods. In this case, the owner of the right must bear the resulting damage himself. 
Everyone must himself make provision for the occurrence of such damage due to 
his own conduct, eg by saving money or by taking out insurance, ie by distributing 
the risk among many people.
</p>
<p>B.  Infringement by chance ( casus )
</p>
<p>The second type of cases to be considered is those in which rights are impaired by 
external events, such as natural disasters. In this case too, the owner of the right

<p>must bear the resulting damage himself; everyone must in principle provide for 
such damage by savings or insurance. However, damage as a result of such events 
is misfortune, something which is always possible in a society. The notion of social 
solidarity can mean that society has the duty to help those of its members who are 
the victims of accidental misfortune. Various forms of social support serve this aim.
</p>
<p>C.  Infringement of a right by a third party
</p>
<p>Thirdly, we must look at cases in which rights are infringed by another person. In 
this respect, two options for the protection of rights are conceivable:
</p>
<p>1.  Legal protection by punishing the perpetrator
</p>
<p>The first is to protect rights by punishing the perpetrator. Punishing the perpe-
trator does not, of course, restore the victim&rsquo;s infringed right. However, the fact 
that the legal system provides for punishment of those who infringe others&rsquo; rights 
means infringements of rights may be prevented. Japanese law recognises this de-
terrent function of criminal law &ndash; alongside other functions.
</p>
<p>2.  Legal protection by granting a claim
</p>
<p>The second option consists in granting the victim a claim in order to provide for 
legal protection. In this respect, the type of action which brought about the in-
fringement of the right is significant:
</p>
<p>a.  Protection against damage as a result of a lawful act &ndash; 
compensation
</p>
<p>Firstly, the violation of rights may result from conduct which is allowed by the rel-
evant legal provisions, for example, dispossession. However, even in these cases 
not only is the infringed right per se recognised but, beyond this, compensation 
of the resulting loss is required as a minimum. This notion is based on art 29 para 
3 of the Japanese Constitution ( JC )1, according to which &raquo; Private property [ may ] 
be taken into use for the benefit of the general public in return for fair compensa-
tion. &laquo; According to this, a victim is entitled to seek compensation from the state 
for his loss.

</p>
<p>b.  Protection against damage as a result of an unlawful act &ndash; civil 
law legal instruments
</p>
<p>However, rights can also be infringed by an unlawful act of another person. In 
these cases, civil law instruments are used. The following categories of civil law 
instruments can be distinguished:
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Prevention and elimination of the infringement of the right
The first group includes legal instruments that aim at eliminating the condition 
of the infringement of the right. The idea is to ensure that now and in the future 
the right is no longer infringed. Examples of these include claims that serve the 
protection of in rem rights, such as property, especially claims to have property re-
turned to the owner, reparative injunctions and preventive injunctions. Under the 
Japanese Civil Code ( CC )2, such in rem claims are not expressly regulated but are 
recognised as self-evident. Whether there are also preventive injunctions in other 
cases is controversial; we will return to this in more detail under II. below.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Restitution of injured and usurped rights &ndash; action for unjust 
enrichment by interference
</p>
<p>The second category includes legal instruments to restitute infringed and usurped 
rights. If a right was infringed in the past and the enjoyment of this right usurped, 
then these legal instruments are intended to facilitate the restitution of rights 
usurped in this manner or their value. The action for unjust enrichment by inter-
ference can be regarded as such a legal instrument.
</p>
<p>(   3  )   Indemnification of the damage that results from an 
infringement of a right
</p>
<p>The third category includes legal instruments to indemnify damage that ensues 
due to the infringement of a right. If in the past a right was infringed and if the 
victim sustained harm as a result, then as far as possible he should be restored to 
the state that he would have been in had this harm never occurred. Compensation 
claims in respect of torts are examples of such legal instruments.

</p>
<p>II.  Reparative and preventive injunctions
</p>
<p>There is no express regulation of the preventive injunction in the Japanese Civil 
Code. Thus, the question is what a preventive injunction can be based on.
</p>
<p>A.  Current status of the debate
</p>
<p>1.  Theory based on exclusive, subjective right
</p>
<p>One view is that it is possible when an exclusive, subjective right is infringed to 
require that the infringement be eliminated and that the conduct causing the in-
fringement be desisted from &ndash; in order to prevent an infringement which must be 
feared in the future. This would mean that, if the following exclusive rights are in-
fringed, a claim for reparative or preventive injunctive relief must be recognised. 
Firstly, when there is an infringement of an in rem right, a claim for reparative and 
preventive injunctive relief ( actio negatoria ) is to be recognised as an in rem claim. 
Secondly, personal values, such as life, bodily integrity and also honour and the 
right to a private sphere are important, legally protected interests and must there-
fore be regarded as exclusive, subjective rights just as are in rem rights3.
</p>
<p>2.  Theory based on tort
</p>
<p>By comparison, it is also argued that a reparative or preventive injunction should 
be granted as a consequence of a tort because even when the infringed rights or 
legal goods are not exclusive, it is still necessary in the case of substantial, ongoing 
interference to protect the party affected by granting reparative or preventive in-
junctions, based on the tort. While it used to be argued that a claim for reparative 
or preventive injunctive relief must always be granted when the prerequisites of 
art 709 CC, specifically intention or negligence in particular, are given, nowadays 
such relief is only to be granted if the damage exceeds a certain level which must 
be tolerated as part of everyday, social life4.
</p>
<p>3.  Theory based on wrongful infringement
</p>
<p>Further, it is also argued that reparative or preventive injunctive relief is to be 
granted if legal goods worthy of protection are wrongfully infringed. This is based

<p>519Part 1&emsp; &emsp; Overview
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>on the idea that reparative or preventive injunctions are to be granted on the basis 
of the overall legal system if the legal system is impaired in its functioning and its 
maintenance or restoration is necessary5. Accordingly, if an exclusive, subjective 
right is infringed, this is already deemed wrongful and reparative or preventive 
injunctions are to be granted without further ado. On the other hand, if another 
legal good is injured, reparative or preventive injunctive relief is to be granted if 
the injury to this legal good must be deemed wrongful under consideration of the 
conflicting interests at issue.
</p>
<p>4.  Dualistic theory
</p>
<p>In contrast to the above views, however, it is also argued that both the theory 
based on exclusive, subjective right and the theories based on tort or wrongful in-
fringement can co-exist.
</p>
<p>a.  Theory based on exclusive, subjective rights and theory based on 
wrongful infringement
</p>
<p>One view taken is that the theory based on exclusive, subjective rights and the the-
ory based on wrongful infringement should be recognised alongside each other6. 
In the case of exclusive, subjective rights, such as in rem rights and personality 
rights, there should not be any weighing up of interests but instead reparative or 
preventive injunctive relief should always be granted when such a right is objec-
tively infringed. As the protection thus obtained is nonetheless limited, a preven-
tive injunction should also be granted when another legal good is infringed but 
depending on whether, taking account of the other conflicting interests, this in-
fringement is to be regarded as wrongful.
</p>
<p>b.  Theory based on exclusive, subjective rights and theory  
based on tort
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is also argued that the theory based on exclusive, subjective 
rights and the theory based on tort can exist alongside each other7. According to

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>this view, reparative or preventive relief is to be granted in principle when an ex-
clusive, subjective right is infringed. When, however, an interest that does not en-
joy the same protection as an exclusive right is infringed, reparative or preventive 
injunctive relief should still be granted if there has been a tort insofar as there is 
fault or breach of a duty in relation to conduct by the injuring party.
</p>
<p>5.  Problems associated with the views presented thus far
</p>
<p>As has been shown, opinions regarding the bases of reparative and injunctive re-
lief vary widely. However, each of them poses particular problems.
</p>
<p>a.  Problem of the theory based on exclusive, subjective rights
</p>
<p>Firstly, as far as the theory based on exclusive, subjective rights is concerned, the 
conclusion that reparative or injunctive relief must be granted precisely because 
an exclusive, subjective right is at issue is pure tautology. It is not possible to 
determine in the abstract whether a right is exclusive or not, as this is inextrica-
bly connected with the question of whether the protection of this right is recog-
nised as including elimination of impairments and protection against such or not. 
Therefore, the crux of the issue is whether there is any reason to grant this right 
such extensive protection.

<p>b.  Problem of the theory based on tort
</p>
<p>The difficulty with the theory based on tort is that it is not clear why reparative or 
preventive relief should be granted when there has been a tort. Art 709 CC provides 
for compensation claims as the only legal consequence, therefore a special justi-
fication is necessary in order to award reparative or preventive injunctive relief.
</p>
<p>c.  Problem with the theory based on wrongful infringement
</p>
<p>In the case of the theory based on wrongful infringement, on the other hand, the 
way the wrongfulness is deduced from the rules and principles of the legal system 
is problematic. Even when the infringement of an exclusive, subjective right is 
deemed wrongful per se and reparative or preventive relief is granted directly on

</p>
<p>this basis, there is still no answer as to why this right must be protected so exten-
sively and on what foundation this is provided for in the legal system. Further, in 
the event that other legal interests are infringed, it is unclear how the countervail-
ing interests must be weighed up and how to assess whether the infringement of 
the interest was wrongful or not.
</p>
<p>d.  Problems associated with the dualistic theory
</p>
<p>The dualistic theory cannot solve the above-mentioned problems either.
</p>
<p>B.  Theory based on the duty to protect fundamental rights
</p>
<p>In a departure from the above-described views, it is argued that even when there 
is no express rule, injunctive relief can be based on the duty of the state to protect 
fundamental rights8.
</p>
<p>1.  Justification of claims for reparative and preventive injunctive 
relief
</p>
<p>The following arguments can, therefore, be made in favour of granting a claim for 
reparative or preventive injunctive relief:
</p>
<p>a.  State duty to protect fundamental rights
</p>
<p>The premise taken is that the state has a duty to protect the fundamental rights 
of the individual against interferences by another. If one was to assume that it 
was admissible for the state to watch passively even when someone&rsquo;s fundamen-
tal rights were infringed by another, eg by murder, theft, rape or arson, the state 
would lose its very purpose. Further, modern states prohibit self-help as it were 
in principle, so that individuals are defenceless against interference by others. 
Therefore, it must be a matter of course that the state is obliged to protect the fun-
damental rights of each individual against interference by others9.

</p>
<p>b.  Duty of the courts to develop the law
</p>
<p>If no effective protection of those whose fundamental rights have been infringed 
can be obtained under the protective mechanisms already provided for by the leg-
islator ( compensation on the basis of art 709 CC ), then the courts, which are also 
organs of the state, have a duty to fill the gaps in the legislation and at least to 
grant a minimum standard of protection. Thus, if sufficient protection of funda-
mental rights cannot be attained without granting reparative or preventive injunc-
tive relief, the courts have a duty under the Constitution to grant such injunctive 
relief even in the absence of an explicit rule.
</p>
<p>2.  Prerequisites for the protection of rights
</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is a prerequisite that fundamental rights have been infringed 
or that there is concern that such will be infringed. In this respect fundamen-
tal rights are understood as not only including exclusive rights, ie in rem rights, 
rights of control over assets or bodily integrity rights ( bodily personality rights ).
</p>
<p>3.  Justification for limiting the rights of the perpetrator
</p>
<p>If reparative or preventive relief is granted in the manners described above to a 
victim, this necessarily leads to a limitation on the rights of the perpetrator. As 
the perpetrator also has ( fundamental ) rights, the state may not limit these exces-
sively. As the rights of the perpetrator collide with those of the victim, it is neces-
sary to weigh up the different rights in advance, as is explained in the following10.
</p>
<p>Firstly, the more the rights of the perpetrator would be limited by rewarding 
the victim reparative or preventive injunctive relief, the more substantial a justi-
fication is required for such interference. The greater the necessity to protect the 
rights of the victim, the more likely there is such justification. In this respect, the 
two following elements play a role when it comes to weighing up the interests:
</p>
<p>On the one hand, the ranking of the infringed right is material. Real property 
rights or personality rights must certainly be deemed to rank highly, so that it is 
easier to justify reparative or preventive injunctive relief.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the gravity of the infringement also plays a role. For exam-
ple, even when an in rem or a personality right is infringed, it is not necessary to 
grant reparative or preventive injunctive relief if the infringement is only minimal. 
In the case of other rights, such injunctive relief ought only to be granted if the in-
</p>
<p>10 In this context the principle of proportionality applies in the narrower sense. This corresponds 
to the comparative principles in the flexible system. Cf Otte, Zur Anwendung komparativer

<p>fringement is substantial and there are no other effective means available to rem-
edy it other than reparative or preventive injunctive relief.
</p>
<p>III.  Disgorgement of profit
</p>
<p>A.  The problem issue
</p>
<p>If someone obtains a benefit from using the legal goods of another without this 
party&rsquo;s agreement, the question arises as to whether the owner of the right may 
demand the disgorgement of the benefit so obtained. It is a matter of debate in Ja-
pan whether such a claim for disgorgement of profit is to be awarded or not.
</p>
<p>1.  Limits of the protection against legal infringements
</p>
<p>Using the legal good of another person without the latter&rsquo;s consent is deemed to 
be an infringement of a right. However, it is difficult to justify a claim for disgorge-
ment of the benefit thus obtained on the basis of the legal instruments available 
under the applicable law in the case of infringement of a right.
</p>
<p>The law of tort is aimed at compensating the damage that is sustained by the 
owner of the right. The profit obtained by the unauthorised user can, however, not 
really be seen as damage.
</p>
<p>The law on unjust enrichment, on the other hand, is aimed at the restitution 
of a usurped benefit to which the owner of the right is entitled. However, the ben-
efit obtained by the unauthorised user can hardly be deemed to be the loss of the 
owner of the right, which would be the basis for such a claim according to the tra-
ditional view.
</p>
<p>2.  Problem issue
</p>
<p>The action by which a third party&rsquo;s legal good was put to unauthorised use and a 
benefit thus obtained can be looked at from two different angles. Depending on 
which of these is emphasised, two different perspectives are possible.
</p>
<p>a.  Obtaining a benefit by unauthorised use of a third party&rsquo;s  
legal good
</p>
<p>One view is that the party who made the unauthorised use obtains his benefit 
precisely from interfering in a third party&rsquo;s right. This in turn has twofold signifi-
cance.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Firstly, the benefit obtained by the unauthorised use is a benefit that in fact 
may only be drawn by the person who owns the right. Therefore, the benefit must 
be allocated to the owner of the right, while the party who made the unauthorised 
use may not retain it.
</p>
<p>Secondly, the benefit obtained by the party who made the unauthorised use is 
a benefit that was obtained by unlawfully using a right that he was not allowed to 
use. Therefore, such party should not be allowed to keep this benefit.
</p>
<p>b.  Obtaining a benefit by one&rsquo;s own ability and work
</p>
<p>The other view emphasises that the benefit obtained in an unjustified manner is 
the result of the ability and work of the party who made the unauthorised use. If 
the entire benefit is withdrawn from such, this means that the owner of the right 
acquires a benefit without having worked for it.
</p>
<p>B.  The status of the debate in civil law
</p>
<p>1.  View rejecting the surrender of the benefit
</p>
<p>Some argue that, according to applicable civil law, no claim for surrender of the 
entire benefit obtained by the party making unauthorised use can be granted to 
the owner of the right11. A claim for surrender can only be granted insofar as this 
relates to a loss suffered by the owner of the right, ie insofar as the return of an 
unjust enrichment or the compensation of the damage can be traced back to a tort.
</p>
<p>In this respect it is not necessary to prove a specific loss in the individual case, 
rather it is sufficient when the unauthorised use generally effects a correspond-
ing enrichment and thus, it may be assumed that the owner of the right has suf-
fered a corresponding loss. If the party that made the unauthorised use exploited 
his own special ability or a special opportunity and thus gained an enrichment 
that exceeded what is usually foreseeable, this does not represent any loss for the 
owner of the right and any claim for surrender is not to be awarded to this extent.
</p>
<p>2.  View supporting the claim for surrender
</p>
<p>Contrariwise, others argue that in such cases the owner of the right has a claim 
to surrender of the benefit which should be granted. The justification for this is 
controversial, however:

<p>525Part 1&emsp; &emsp; Overview
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>a.  Imputation of the benefit to the owner of the right &ndash; quasi 
negotiorum gestio
</p>
<p>According to another view, a claim for surrender must be granted to the owner of 
the right on the basis of the concept that the benefit which the party that made 
the unauthorised use obtained is actually imputable to the owner of the right. The 
argument is that administering someone else&rsquo;s affairs for one&rsquo;s own purposes is 
similar to negotiorum gestio and thus, the relevant rules should be applied analo-
gously12.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Effects of quasi negotiorum gestio
According to this, the party making the unjust use must surrender everything 
that he obtained from administering the other person&rsquo;s affairs ( art 701 CC by anal-
ogy )13. The owner of the right, on the other hand, must to the extent that he ob-
tains a benefit, indemnify the party that made the unauthorised use for useful 
costs in this respect ( art 702 CC by analogy ).
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Criticism
This categorisation as quasi negotiorum gestio is criticised, however, on the basis 
that negotiorum gestio actually requires that the conduct is altruistic and it would 
be contrary to the essence of the concept to equate administering another&rsquo;s affairs 
for one&rsquo;s own use to an altruistic action.
</p>
<p>b.  Sanctioning the unauthorised use
</p>
<p>A further line of opinion considers that the owner of the right&rsquo;s claim to surrender 
of the benefit should be recognised because it ought not to be allowed that some-
one who makes unauthorised use of the legal goods of another be permitted to 
keep the resulting benefit14.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Justification
It would further be an injustice if a benefit was allocated to the party that obtained 
it due to an intentional and unlawful action &ndash; albeit also by means of his ability 
and work. Therefore, the disgorgement of the benefit obtained from the unau-
thorised use is to be stipulated as a sanction against the party that carried out the 
wrongful action.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Criticism
However, there is criticism that such an emphasis on the penalising function is 
not reconcilable with the basic principles of the Civil Code.
</p>
<p>C.  Solution de lege ferenda
</p>
<p>Since, as described above, it is difficult under applicable law to recognise any 
claim of the owner of the right to surrender of the benefit, a solution de lege fer-
enda is desirable. In respect of the unauthorised use of intellectual property, for 
example, special laws have established a rule according to which it is presumed 
that the owner of the right has suffered damage to the same degree that the in-
juring party obtained a benefit ( cf, eg, art 102 Patent Act, art 29 Utility Model Act, 
art 39 Design Act, art 28 Trademark Act, art 25 Act on the Circuit Layout of a Semi-
conductor Integrated Circuits, art 114 Copy Right Act and art 5 of the Unfair Com-
petition Prevention Act ).
</p>
<p>IV.  Other legal instruments available to the victim
</p>
<p>A.  Limits of the law of damages
</p>
<p>With a focus on which protection is available to the victim, the law of damages has 
the following limitations:
</p>
<p>1.  Limits due to the necessary prerequisites
</p>
<p>As the law of damages imposes liability upon the injuring party, it is necessary to 
take the rights of the injuring party into account too, which is why there must be 
certain prerequisites &ndash; the minimum requirement being that the injuring party 
infringed the rights of the victim &ndash; in order to justify imposing liability upon the 
injuring party.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>2.  Limits due to the financial means of the injuring party
</p>
<p>As the law of damages imposes liability upon the injuring party, there will ulti-
mately be no compensation of the damage if the injuring party does not dispose 
of sufficient means.
</p>
<p>3.  Limits due to the legal proceeding
</p>
<p>As, thirdly, the law of damages provides for liability to be enforced by means of a court 
proceeding, there is also the problem of the ensuing expenses of time and money.
</p>
<p>B.  Institutions that complement the law of damages &ndash; third party 
liability insurance
</p>
<p>There is liability insurance that builds on the law of damages, ie it requires that 
the injuring party be liable for infringing a right, and serves to safeguard the en-
forceability of such liability.
</p>
<p>1.  Significance
</p>
<p>Liability insurance means that, when the injuring party has a duty to compensate, 
the insurer must pay out the insurance sum on the basis of this insurance event. 
The prerequisite for this is that the injuring party took out insurance cover before-
hand and paid the insurance premiums.
</p>
<p>2.  Function
</p>
<p>Liability insurance fulfils two functions: firstly, it facilitates the enforceability of 
the victim&rsquo;s claims in that it ensures that the injuring party has sufficient financial 
means. Secondly, it serves to distribute the burden resulting from having to com-
pensate among several possible injuring parties.
</p>
<p>C.  Institutions independent of the law of damages
</p>
<p>Insofar as a tort is required as a basis, there are firstly limitations due to the re-
spective prerequisites of the legal instruments, secondly these are ultimately sub-
ject to a court decision; therefore, the question arises whether simpler and faster 
relief is available. For this reason, the following institutions, which do not require 
any tort, also exist.

</p>
<p>1.  Relief provided by the community of potential causers &ndash; accident 
insurance
</p>
<p>Firstly, there is accident insurance where a group of parties who may cause dam-
age collect money and a certain payment is made to the victim regardless of 
whether there is a tort.
</p>
<p>a.  Specific examples
</p>
<p>On the basis of the Workmen&rsquo;s Accident Compensation Law15 of 1947, compensa-
tion is paid out in the case of work accidents. The Pollution-Related Health Dam-
age Compensation Law16 of 1973 regulates compensation when health is impaired 
due to environmental problems. Further, the Act on Assistance in the case of Drug 
Side-Effects Injuries Relief and Research Promotion Fund Act17, now the Act con-
cerning the self-governing body &raquo; Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency &laquo; 
( 2002 ), provides for help in the case of damage from the side-effects of a medicine.
</p>
<p>b.  Special features
</p>
<p>The various insurance systems have the following special features:
Firstly, the payments are financed wholly or in part by contributions from the 
</p>
<p>group of potential causers ( eg, employers, those who emit pollutants or pharma-
ceutical enterprises ).
</p>
<p>Secondly, the payments are calculated on the basis of certain formalised 
standards. Therefore, the actual damage will not necessarily be compensated.
</p>
<p>2.  Help from the state &ndash; social insurance
</p>
<p>Further, there is the social security system that provides help from the state to the 
party who has suffered an accident, regardless of whether there was a tort.
</p>
<p>a.  Compensation for victims of crimes
</p>
<p>There is a compensation scheme for victims of crime, for example, on the basis of 
the Law of 1980 on the payment of benefits to victims of crime18. The beneficiaries 
of this scheme are those who are bereaved after someone is killed in a crime as

</p>
<p>Part 2 The tasks of tort law
</p>
<p>I.  Compensation of the damage
</p>
<p>Within the law of damages, one question is how the goal of protecting the rights 
of the victim, on the one hand, and the aim of not excessively limiting the rights 
of the injuring party on the other, can be reconciled.
</p>
<p>A.  Compensation of the damage &ndash; protection of the victim&rsquo;s rights
</p>
<p>Firstly, granting a claim for compensation of damage that has arisen as a result of 
interference by another party is the necessary minimum standard of protection 
for legal goods. On the other hand, any compensation that exceeds the compensa-
tion of the damage sustained is no longer in harmony with the notion of protec-
tion of rights.
</p>
<p>B.  Limitation of the injuring party&rsquo;s rights by the protection of the 
victim &ndash; observing the injuring party&rsquo;s rights
</p>
<p>Secondly, the protection afforded to the victim may not excessively limit the rights 
of the injuring party. Therefore, the question of to what extent the limitation of 
the injuring party&rsquo;s rights in order to protect the victim&rsquo;s rights is justified arises.
</p>
<p>II.  Deterrence and penal function
</p>
<p>Both criminal and administrative law penalties are available as a means to deter 
people from committing unlawful actions and to punish perpetrators. It is ques-
tionable whether the law of torts, which in contrast to criminal and administrative 
law is a civil law area, can also be seen as a means to realise the above-mentioned 
purposes.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>A.  Actual functions
</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that in practice the law of torts also serves to deter perpe-
trators and / or to penalise their conduct together with criminal law and the admin-
istrative law rules.
</p>
<p>1.  Deterrent function
</p>
<p>Firstly, there is the possibility that the law of torts creates an incentive for poten-
tial injuring parties to act with care and to desist from dangerous acts in order to 
avoid creating duties to compensate.
</p>
<p>2.  Penalising function
</p>
<p>Further, the fact that liability is imposed upon the injuring party may satisfy any 
desires on the part of the victim or society to exact revenge and to penalise the in-
juring party.
</p>
<p>B.  Deterrence and / or penalising function
</p>
<p>The question arises whether, for the purpose of deterring the injuring party and / or 
penalising him, it should be possible to award compensation that goes beyond 
the indemnification of the damage sustained ( punitive damages ) or to award dou-
ble or triple times the worth of the damage sustained ( multiple damages ).
</p>
<p>1.  Affirmation of the deterrence and penalising function
</p>
<p>Such a payment exceeding the damage actually suffered for the purposes of deter-
rence or punishment is advocated by some20, on the basis of the following consid-
erations:
</p>
<p>Firstly, there is no unambiguous boundary between civil law on the one side 
and criminal and administrative law, on the other; rather this boundary runs dif-
ferently in different states and also changes over the course of time. In any case, 
it is too sweeping a statement to say that deterrence and punishment ought to be 
completely excluded from the civil law rules as this would represent too categori-
cal a distinction between civil law and criminal and administrative law.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Furthermore, if one approaches the question from a functional perspective, 
namely how one can better enforce compliance with the law, one would have to 
support imposing penalties if this deters potential perpetrators from committing 
damaging acts and a more effective enforcement of the law can be achieved.
</p>
<p>Finally, in more recent times it has been argued against the background of the 
economic analysis of law that the notion of compensating the victim&rsquo;s damage is 
not explained rationally in many instances by the applicable law of torts and thus, 
the main purpose of the law of torts is instead to be seen in the optimal preven-
tion of unlawful acts21.
</p>
<p>2.  Rejection of the deterrence and penalising function
</p>
<p>In contrast to the above-described view, however, in Japan the prevailing opinion 
is that no damages exceeding the compensation of the actual damage are to be 
awarded22. This is justified as follows:
</p>
<p>Firstly, the Japanese Civil Code only provides for a duty to compensate in ac-
cordance with damage sustained, as is shown in the wording of art 709 CC, pursu-
ant to which the injuring party is obliged &raquo; to compensate any damage resulting in 
consequence &laquo;. Further, the victim&rsquo;s rights are protected by the compensation of 
the actual damage; there is no justified interest in obtaining compensation going 
beyond this. Any and all payments exceeding the compensation of damage can-
not be justified simply by the fact that this would serve to penalise or deter dam-
aging acts. The injuring party also has rights, and limiting these excessively is not 
admissible.

</p>
<p>Part 3 Structure of the law of torts
</p>
<p>I.  Overview of the system of delict law in Japan
</p>
<p>First, there will be an overview of the structure of delict law in Japan.
</p>
<p>A.  General rule
</p>
<p>1.  Prerequisites for liability
</p>
<p>a.  Basic prerequisites
</p>
<p>The Japanese Civil Code sets out the basic prerequisites for delictual liability in 
art709: &raquo; A person who has intentionally or negligently infringed any right of oth-
ers, or legally protected interest of others, shall be liable to compensate any dam-
age resulting in consequence &laquo;.
</p>
<p>Therefore, like French law but unlike German law, Japanese law has a uniform 
rule on delictual liability. While French law requires that &raquo; damage &laquo; has occurred, 
Japanese law requires the infringement of a &raquo; right of others, or legally protected 
interest of others &laquo;. Unlike under &sect; 823 para 1 of the German Civil Code ( BGB ), 
rights or legally protected interests in the sense of art 709 CC are not limited to 
absolute rights.
</p>
<p>b.  Exclusion of liability &ndash; grounds for exoneration
</p>
<p>The Japanese Civil Code sets out the following grounds on which delictual liability 
is denied despite fulfillment of the above-named basic prerequisites:
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Lack of capacity for fault
The first case is when there is lack of capacity for fault. There are specific rules in 
this respect for two different cases. According to art 712 CC, there is no liability 
when a minor does not possess the necessary powers of discernment to recognise 
that he could be accountable for his actions. Art 713 CC excludes liability when 
someone, due to a mental disability, is not in a state to have the capacity to recog-
nise that his actions could make him accountable. Insofar, the subjective abilities 
of the specific perpetrator to recognise the legal responsibility ensuing from his 
actions are taken as the basis; however, liability does not depend on his ability to 
act in accordance with such insight.

</p>
<p>(   2  )   Self-defence and necessity
Furthermore, self-defence and necessity exclude liability ( art 720 CC ).
</p>
<p>2.  Legal consequences
</p>
<p>a.  Damages
</p>
<p>The Japanese Civil Code provides for damages as the legal consequence of tort.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Entitlement to claim
There are two special rules in relation to who is entitled to assert a claim for dam-
ages. The first is art 721 CC, according to which an unborn child is deemed already 
to have been born in respect of the right to seek compensation. Moreover, accord-
ing to the second special rule in art 711 CC, certain close relatives can also seek 
damages for pain and suffering when the victim dies.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Contents of compensation
With respect to the content of the compensation, the following rules exist:
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Type&emsp;of&emsp;compensation
</p>
<p>Compensation shall be made in money ( art 722 para 1 in combination with art 417 
CC ).
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Damage
</p>
<p>The general rule in art 709 CC merely provides that the object of the compensation 
is &raquo; damage &laquo;. Art 710 CC, however, also provides expressly for the compensation of 
non-pecuniary damage.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;iii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Extent&emsp;and&emsp;assessment&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;compensation
</p>
<p>With respect to the extent and assessment of the compensation, the general rule 
in art 709 CC merely provides that &raquo; any damage resulting in consequence &laquo; must 
be compensated. Art 722 para 2 CC, however, provides for a reduction of compen-
sation when the victim acted negligently ( contributory fault ).
</p>
<p>(   3  )   Prescripton
Compensation claims are barred three years after knowledge of the damage and 
the identity of the injuring party or at the latest 20 years after the point in time of 
the tort ( art 724 CC ).

</p>
<p>b.  Further legal instruments
</p>
<p>Besides monetary damages, art 723 CC provides by way of exception for restitution 
in kind in the case of injuries to the reputation of a person, namely by restoring 
his reputation.
</p>
<p>B.  Special rules
</p>
<p>Further, the Japanese Civil Code provides for special rules that supplement the 
basic rule in art 709 with respect to special situations.
</p>
<p>1.  Tort with the involvement of several parties
</p>
<p>Firstly, there are rules on the involvement of several people in a tort. Within this 
context, two cases must be distinguished:
</p>
<p>a.  Liability due to the action of another
</p>
<p>Firstly, there is the case that someone other than the direct injuring party is liable 
to pay compensation.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Civil Code
The Civil Code provides for three forms of this type of liability. Firstly, under 
art 714 CC it is possible for those with a duty to supervise to be held liable when 
someone who is not capable of fault inflicts damage. Secondly, under art 715 CC a 
principal can be held liable for the damaging conduct of employees. Thirdly, un-
der art 716 CC, someone who has commissioned work can be held liable for the 
damaging conduct of the works contractor.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Special laws
Furthermore, the following two types of liability are regulated in special laws: ac-
cording to art 1 of the State Redress Act23, the state or public entity is liable for 
damage that a public official inflicts wrongfully and intentionally or negligently 
upon another in exercising the public power of the state or public entity in carry-
ing out his duties ( public liability ).
</p>
<p>Secondly, whoever places a car at another&rsquo;s use for their own benefit is liable 
to compensate the damage that the other sustains to his life or body due to op-
erating the car ( liability of the keeper of the motor vehicle, art 3 Law on securing 
compensation for damage caused by automobiles )24.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>b.  Liability of several injuring parties
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is conceivable that several actors are liable under the law of 
delict. Art 719 CC stipulates that when several commit a tort together, these joint 
perpetrators are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation.
</p>
<p>2.  Damage by a thing
</p>
<p>Further, there are provisions for when damage ensues from a thing.
</p>
<p>a.  Civil Code
</p>
<p>The Civil Code provides for liability in the following two cases.
Firstly, under art 717 CC the possessor or owner of a building is liable when 
</p>
<p>damage is sustained by another party due to the defective construction or main-
tenance of a building.
</p>
<p>Secondly, art 718 CC provides for the liability of the possessor or custodian of 
an animal if the animal inflicts damage upon someone else ( liability of keepers 
of animals ).
</p>
<p>b.  Special laws
</p>
<p>In the field of special statutory rules, the following two types of liability are espe-
cially important. Firstly, the state or public entity is liable for damage that arises 
to another due to defectiveness in the construction or maintenance of roads, riv-
ers, or other public constructions ( art 2 State Redress Act ). Secondly, the producer 
is liable for damage if another is injured in his life, body or property due to a de-
fect in a product ( art 3 Product Liability Act )25.
</p>
<p>II.  Prerequisites for general liability to pay 
compensation: infringement of a right, 
wrongfulness and fault
</p>
<p>Since the Civil Code came into force there has been intense debate on the general 
prerequisites for liability to pay compensation, in particular about the infringe-
ment of a &raquo; right &laquo; and &raquo; fault &laquo;; opinions diverge in a fundamental manner. As this

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>is important with respect to understanding Japanese tort law, the development of 
the debate is outlined below26.
</p>
<p>A.  Starting point
</p>
<p>1.  The rule in art 709 CC
</p>
<p>The original version of art 709 CC when the Civil Code came into force was: &raquo; A per-
son who has intentionally or negligently infringed the right of another shall be li-
able to compensate any damage resulting in consequence &laquo;. The following prereq-
uisites for liability can be inferred from this: firstly, a subjective right of another 
person has been infringed; secondly, the injuring party acted intentionally or neg-
ligently; and thirdly the right is infringed due to the intentional or negligent act of 
the injuring party, ie there is a causal relationship between the injuring party&rsquo;s act 
and the infringement of the victim&rsquo;s subjective right.
</p>
<p>2.  The interpretation of the authors of the Civil Code
</p>
<p>According to the authors of the Civil Code, the prerequisites under art 709 CC 
must be understood as follows27.
</p>
<p>a.  Significance of the infringement of the right as a prerequisite  
for liability
</p>
<p>While the so-called old Civil Code &ndash; which was drafted before the currently valid 
Civil Code by the French lawyer Gustave E. Boissonade, but never came into force &ndash; 
required like the French Code civil that someone inflict damage upon another28, 
the valid Civil Code requires the infringement of a right. This is based on the con-
cept that the field of delictual liability would be over-extended and thus its scope 
unclear if it was sufficient on its own that damage had been inflicted, thus also in-
cluding damage that was not brought about by the infringement of a right.
</p>
<p>26 Cf Yamamoto, Fuh&ocirc; k&ocirc;i h&ocirc;gaku no sai-kent&ocirc; to aratana tenkai &ndash; kenri-ron no shiten kara [ Re-
thinking the law of delict dogmatic and new prospects for development &ndash; from the perspective 
of the rights theory ], H&ocirc;gaku Rons&ocirc; 154&ndash;4 / 5/6 ( 2004 ) 292.
</p>
<p>27 On the history of the drafting of art 709 ZG see Segawa, Minp&ocirc; 709-j&ocirc; ( fuh&ocirc; k&ocirc;i no ippan seir-
itsu y&ocirc;ken ) [ Art 709 ZG ( general prerequisites for delictual liability ) ], in: Hironaka / Hoshino 
( eds ), Minp&ocirc;-ten no hyakunen III [ 100 Years of the Civil Code III ] ( 1998 ) 559.
</p>
<p>28 Art 370 para 1 of the old CC was phrased as follows, drawing on the French formulation, which 
was based on faute and n&eacute;gligence: &raquo; Whoever has inflicted damage on another by negligence or 
fault is liable to compensate such &laquo;.

<p>538 Keiz&ocirc;&emsp;Yamamoto&emsp; &emsp; Japan
</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>The concept of &raquo; right &laquo; in this respect was understood very broadly and in-
cluded both pecuniary rights including rights to claim, as well as personal inter-
ests, such as life or honour and reputation.
</p>
<p>b.  Significance of fault as a prerequisite for liability
</p>
<p>Further, the Civil Code takes the principle of fault as a basis and requires that 
there be intention or negligence. This takes account of the idea that it would be 
unclear how far the liberty of the indivdual was to reach if he was obliged to pay 
compensation even when he had acted duly and properly and exercised sufficient 
care.
</p>
<p>During the work on the Civil Code, however, it emerged that there were two 
different views of fault. On the one hand, fault was understood as &raquo; not doing what 
one ought to do &laquo; and / or &raquo; doing something that one ought not to do &laquo;, thus in 
other words as an infringement of objective duties. On the other hand, fault was 
also seen as a question of the mental state of the injuring party, ie as a subjective, 
psychological condition of the actor.
</p>
<p>B.  The emergence of the traditional view
</p>
<p>The above described view of two liability prerequisites, namely infringement of a 
right and intention or negligence, was later comprehensively revised. The prereq-
uisite of infringement of a right was revised first.
</p>
<p>1.  Turning point in the case law
</p>
<p>a.  Case law in the beginning
</p>
<p>In the beginning case law interpreted the expression &raquo; right &laquo; very narrowly and 
only imposed liability for compensation if a right, that was already recognised in 
the legal system, was infringed29.
</p>
<p>b.  Change in the case law
</p>
<p>As time went on, however, the number of social interests to be protected by the 
law of damages grew &ndash; in line with changes in societal conditions. Therefore, case 
law took a different course in order to adapt to the new situation. Firstly, it was 
deemed to be sufficient when a &raquo; legally protected interest &laquo; was infringed30. Later,

<p>539Part 3&emsp; &emsp; Structure&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;law&emsp;of&emsp;torts
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>the unlawful act amounting to the tort was understood as an &raquo; act which is con-
trary to a statutory requirement or prohibition &laquo; and the prerequisite that there 
be an infringement of a right was reinterpreted as a prerequisite that someone in-
jured another by means of an unlawful act.
</p>
<p>2.  The development of the prevailing doctrine &ndash; from infringement 
of a right to wrongfulness
</p>
<p>a.  The emergence of the doctrine of wrongfulness
</p>
<p>In line with the change in the case law, legal theory also argued that the prerequi-
site for delictual liability was not the infringement of a right but wrongfulness31. 
This was reasoned as follows.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Understanding of the legal system
This new doctrine was based on the following understanding of the legal system: 
the legal system was seen as consisting of the individual positive legal rules, in 
particular statutory law and customary law, together. This view distinguished be-
tween laws requiring something and laws allowing something. Laws that require 
something are rules that make an act or omission obligatory, while laws that allow 
something do not simply issue requirements or prohibitions but stipulate posi-
tively that a certain act is admissible. It considered that these express legal norms 
also left gaps, which were to be filled in harmony with ordre public as the system 
of fundamental principles behind the overall legal system.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Significance of the infringement of a right
On the basis of the developments described above, subjective rights were under-
stood as a specification of the legal system ( the laws allowing something ). Hence, 
infringement of a right is to be automatically deemed wrongful as it is a breach of 
the legal system as such.
</p>
<p>(   3  )   From infringement of a right to wrongfulness
Since &ndash; as just explained &ndash; an infringement of a right is per se generally to be re-
garded as wrongful, the prerequisite for liability consisting in infringement of a 
right as stipulated in the Civil Code must, the theory argues, be understood as 
meaning that the act by which damage is inflicted upon the other person must be 
wrongful. According to this view, &raquo; infringement of a right &laquo; is only an expression 
for an action which is not accepted legally, ie for an action that must be evaluated 
as wrongful since it offends the legal system.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Therefore, liability should also be recognised, so the argument, even when 
there is no infringement of a right but the injuring party&rsquo;s action is otherwise to 
be deemed wrongful. Thus, when there is wrongfulness in the form of an infringe-
ment of a statutory requirement or prohibition or a breach of ordre public, then  
liability for compensation is to be recognised even when no infringement of a 
right can be assumed.
</p>
<p>b.  Evaluation of wrongfulness
</p>
<p>As time went on, the view that saw wrongfulness as the prerequisite for liability 
prevailed. It also contends that the degree of wrongfulness based on the injured 
interests and the degree of wrongfulness with respect to how the interfering act 
was carried out must both be comprehensively evaluated and the relationship be-
tween them also considered in order to establish wrongfulness32.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Degree of wrongfulness based on the injured interests
As far as the injured interests are concerned, there are gradual declinations be-
tween clearly defined rights and those rights that are still at a stage of develop-
ment. There is greater wrongfulness in the case of a strong right being infringed 
as compared to a more weakly developed right.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Rights&emsp;to&emsp;control&emsp;things&emsp;in&emsp;relation&emsp;to&emsp;one&rsquo;s&emsp;assets
</p>
<p>Since the direct control over a thing is protected in relation to everyone else in the 
case of in rem rights as absolute rights, an infringement of these rights is wrong-
ful to a very high degree. The infringement of copyright, patent rights, rights to 
utility models and designs or trademarks, which are likewise protected against 
everyone else, is also highly wrongful.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Claims&emsp;and&emsp;rights&emsp;to&emsp;trade
</p>
<p>In the case of claims, on the other hand, which by contrast have no exclusive ef-
fect, any infringement is only wrongful by virtue of the type and nature of the act, 
eg by the use of unfair means. Insofar as there is interference with the established 
and operating business enterprise, wrongfulness is determined on the basis of the 
type and nature of the interference. Although the business enterprise has an inde-
pendent pecuniary value, there is nonetheless not such a clearly defined right as 
property, so that the type and nature of the interference is material.

<p>aa.	 	Life	and	bodily	integrity
Injury to life and bodily integrity is, of course, wrongful.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Freedom	and	reputation
</p>
<p>By contrast, interference with liberty is not automatically wrongful; it depends 
on the act causing the infringement. Therefore, it is not necessary to take the 
infringement of the right to liberty as a basis; it is sufficient when wrongfulness 
can be established given the type and nature of the interfering action. The injury 
to reputation must be treated in exactly the same fashion; accordingly, wrongful-
nesss must be evaluated on the basis of the type and nature of the interfering ac-
tion.
</p>
<p>cc.	 	Right	to	one&rsquo;s	name,	image	and	reputation
</p>
<p>The rights to one&rsquo;s name, image and with respect to one&rsquo;s reputation, etc are le-
gally recognised but are not absolute rights. Therefore, wrongfulness depends on 
the type and nature of the interfering action; there is only wrongfulness if a law or 
ordre public is breached.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Degree of wrongfulness with respect to the type and nature  
of the infringing action
</p>
<p>In the area between exercising a right and a breach of the law, the degree of wrong-
fulness increases gradually with respect to the type and nature of the infringing 
action. If damage is inflicted on a third party by an action that constitutes a crimi-
nal act, this damaging action is very clearly wrongful. If there is a breach of an ad-
ministrative law prohibition, there is only wrongfulness in the sense of the law of 
delicts if the purpose of the administrative law prohibition lies in the protection 
of individual interests. If the administrative law prohibition aims at the protection 
of individual interests and if the breach of this law results in damage to the person 
who it aims to protect, then there is wrongfulness. Further, wrongfulness is also to 
be assumed if there is no direct breach of a particular law but instead against the 
ordre public or &raquo; public morals &laquo;. As far the exercise of a right is concerned, exer-
cising it within a reasonable extent is not wrongful but, when the right is abused, 
this is wrongful.

<p>(   3  )   Evaluation of the degrees of wrongfulness in relation to  
each other
</p>
<p>The evaluation of the degree of wrongfulness based on the infringed interests and 
the degree of wrongfulness with respect to the type and nature of the interfer-
ing action in relation to each other must be carried out according to the follow-

<p>ing guidelines33. Wrongfulness is greatest when an absolute right is infringed by 
an unlawful action. By contrast, wrongfulness is weakest when a right that is still 
emerging within social conditions is infringed by the exercise of another right. In 
turn, if there is infringement of a right with only weak absolute effect or which is 
unclear in terms of content, wrongfulness must be determined on the basis of the 
type and nature of the infringing action.
</p>
<p>3.  The concept of fault
</p>
<p>The prerequisites for fault were understood as follows according to the earlier pre-
vailing theory34.
</p>
<p>a.  Subjective aspect of the concept of fault
</p>
<p>Negligence was understood as lack of care, requiring that the perpetrator is men-
tally capable of foreseeing the result of an action. This means that fault was seen 
as a subjective prerequisite for liability.
</p>
<p>b.  Objective aspect of the concept of fault
</p>
<p>The yardstick for sufficient care, however, was the degree of care which the law 
requires of every member of society. Thus, whoever could have foreseen the re-
sult had he applied the care required of members of society but did not exercise 
this degree of care acts negligently. This represents an objective understanding of 
fault.
</p>
<p>C.  Confusion within the theory of the law of delicts
</p>
<p>Against the background of increases in delict law proceedings in the 1960s and 
1970s, the above-described traditional theory was called into question. There were 
heated confrontations between those who called for a departure from or adapta-
tion of the wrongfulness theory and those who supported retaining the wrongful-
ness theory and making it stricter35.

<p>543Part 3&emsp; &emsp; Structure&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;law&emsp;of&emsp;torts
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>1.  Uniform concept of fault
</p>
<p>The view that advocated turning away from or adapting the wrongfulness theory 
rejected wrongfulness as a prerequisite for liability and considered that wrongful-
ness was already included under fault36.
</p>
<p>a.  Arguments for uniformity
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Rejection of the concept of wrongfulness
The above view gives the following reasons for not seeing any point in applying the 
concept of wrongfulness nowadays. The original aim was to expand the expres-
sion &raquo; right &laquo; in art 709 CC. However, in the course of the development from the &raquo; in-
fringement of a right &laquo; to &raquo; wrongfulness &laquo; as a prerequisite, the concept of wrong-
fulness lost its function, so the argument. Limiting delictual liability, according to 
this view, is accomplished not usually by requiring that there be infringement of a 
right before someone is held liable but instead that there be fault.
</p>
<p>A look at the case law also shows that wrongfulness does not fulfil any func-
tion separately and independently from fault as a prerequisite for liability, the 
argument goes. In fact, many decisions do not even take wrongfulness as a prem-
ise. Even when wrongfulness is drawn upon, then it is only in order to establish 
whether there was a tort but not, on the other hand, in contrast to fault as a sub-
jective prerequisite of tort.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Coincidence with fault
For these reasons, supporters of this view argue it is no longer possible nowadays 
to maintain the distinction between wrongfulness as an objective prerequisite for 
liability and fault as a subjective prerequisite for liability; instead one must pro-
ceed on the basis that an objectivised fault has become the core yardstick for the 
normative assessment of whether or not there has been a tort. This reasoning is 
based on the following considerations.
</p>
<p>Firstly, the number of judgments that proceed on the basis of fault in the 
sense of a breach of a legal duty to do something has risen sharply. It is argued 
that this shows that fault coincides with wrongfulness.
</p>
<p>The contention is that this phenomenon derives from the necessity to take ac-
count of the changes in society. In today&rsquo;s society there have been the following 
qualitative changes, which have led to an increase in the risk of infringement of 
rights: for instance, not only has there been fast progress in high speed transpor-
tation, such as trains or cars, and an increase in the number of enterprises that 
produce hazardous substances like electricity and gas using dangerous machines

</p>
<p>in the process, the social contact between individual members of society has also 
become more intense.
</p>
<p>This has meant that the needs for protection have also risen and, in order to 
meet these new challenges, supporters of this view argue that it is necessary above 
all to focus on whether someone did not do what he was supposed to do or did 
something he was not supposed to do and not whether someone sufficiently exer-
cised the will to avoid the occurrence of damage. Therefore, according to this view, 
it is inevitable that fault be understood as a breach of a duty of conduct.
</p>
<p>b.  Yardstick for fault
</p>
<p>According to this view, fault in this sense should be determined as follows:
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Meaning of fault
Fault means that the responsibility must be foreseeable and thus, there must be 
a breach of a recognisable duty to act in a way that the risk of damage occuring be 
avoided.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Elements to be considered &ndash; Learned-Hand formula
Whether there is such a duty of conduct and, if so, to what extent, must be assessed 
under consideration of the Learned-Hand formula, originating from US-American 
law, by weighing up the following elements. Firstly, there is the probability of the 
damage occurring ( the probability that a disadvantageous result occurs be caused 
by the action found to be culpable ), ie the dangerousness, and the weight of the 
injured interest ( the weight of the interest that will prospectively be infringed by 
the action ) and, secondly, the interests that will be impaired by the fulfilment of 
the duty of conduct. If the first two elements outweigh the third, then a duty of 
conduct must be recongised, so the argument.
</p>
<p>2.  Stricter application of the theory of wrongfulness and fault
</p>
<p>On the other hand, others argue that the theoretical framework of the traditional 
doctrine &ndash; wrongfulness and fault &ndash; should be retained, albeit applied even more 
strictly and precisely.
</p>
<p>a.  Blameworthiness of the injuring party
</p>
<p>According to this view, delictual liability is based on the blameworthiness of the 
injuring party. Therefore, the following two levels of possible blameworthiness are 
necessary for a duty to compensate to be imputed37. The first is a general, objective

</p>
<p>blameworthiness with respect to the action. This corresponds to wrongfulness. 
The second is an individual, subjective blameworthiness with respect to the acting 
party. This corresponds to fault.
</p>
<p>b.  Concept of wrongfulness and fault
</p>
<p>Even within this view there is controversy on how wrongfulness and fault should 
be understood.
</p>
<p>It is particularly controversial whether the wrongfulness is to be established 
on the basis of the result or of the conduct.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Wrongfulness established by the result
According to the theory of wrongfulness established by the result, the fact that a 
result, namely the infringement of a right or legally protected interest, has been 
brought about and / or the risk that this will happen, is wrongful. Insofar as one 
understands legally protected interests as being restricted to the relevant indi-
vidual persons, this follows from the traditional perspective according to which 
rights are protected against interferences or threats.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Wrongfulness of conduct
The theory of wrongfulness of conduct, on the other hand, proceeds on the basis 
that the wrongfulness is founded in the breach of a duty of conduct laid down by 
the legal system. This theory began to gain support as the theory of wrongfulness 
established by the result could no longer be maintained against the background 
of the modern phenomenon consisting in the &raquo; permitted danger &laquo;.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Increase&emsp;of&emsp;useful&emsp;but&emsp;dangerous&emsp;activities
</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s society, our potential to harm one another has grown dramatically due 
to the advances of science and technology and also because the social contacts 
between people have become more manifold. However, if one was to see, for ex-
ample, medical treatment, the use of motorised transportation or the operation 
of factories as unlawful acts due to their dangerousness and accordingly recognise 
sweeping liability, then this would paralyse society.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Limitation&emsp;of&emsp;liability&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;infringement&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;duty&emsp;of&emsp;conduct
</p>
<p>Conduct that is dangerous but must be allowed as it is beneficial to the general 
public only gives rise to liability if the conduct does not correspond to the care 
necessary in the interaction, ie it breaches a duty of conduct.

</p>
<p>3.  Departure from the structure based on  
wrongfulness and fault
</p>
<p>In contrast to the above, however, there is also a school of thought that seeks to 
depart from the German model of distinguishing between wrongfulness and fault. 
According to this view, it is not necessary to read something into art 709 CC as a 
prerequisite in the form of wrongfulness when this was originally alien to the Civil 
Code. Instead it is sufficient to take intention and / or negligence and an infringe-
ment of a right as the basis for liability, in line with the wording of the provision38.
</p>
<p>a.  Infringement of a right
</p>
<p>According to this view, infringement of a right is a prerequisite that relates to the 
result of the damaging action. This concerns the question of what constitutes an 
infringed interest, that is an interest worthy of legal protection.
</p>
<p>b.  Intention and negligence
</p>
<p>Intention and / or negligence, on the other hand, is a prerequisite according to this 
line of thought, that relates to the damaging action itself. Thus, this concerns the 
type and nature of the infringing action, ie the infringement of the duty of con-
duct.
</p>
<p>D.  Return to the liberal rights thesis
</p>
<p>In more recent times there is also support for the view that takes subjective rights 
as the starting point to determine the prerequisites for delictual liability ( rights 
thesis )39.
</p>
<p>This view wants to reconceive the law of delicts in the light of the constitu-
tional law guarantee of fundamental rights. This concept is based on the follow-
ing ideas.

</p>
<p>1.  Necessity for legal protection
</p>
<p>a.  Rights and legally protected interests that are the object of the 
law of delicts
</p>
<p>This view is based on the idea that the rights and legally protected interests that 
are the object of the law of delicts can be equated with the constitutional law fun-
damental rights. Thus, for example, property and other in rem rights, intellectual 
property rights and rights to claim would correspond to the pecuniary rights pro-
tected under the Constitution ( art 29 JC ). Life, bodily integrity, health, honour and 
reputation as well as rights to a private sphere, one&rsquo;s own name and image cor-
respond to the personality rights protected under the Constitution as well as the 
right to pursue happiness ( art 13 JC ). The different rights to liberty are matched 
to the psychological and economic rights of freedom protected by the Constitu-
tion and in the general freedom of action as well as the right to pursue happiness 
( art 13 JC ).
</p>
<p>b.  Law of delicts as a system to protect fundamental rights
</p>
<p>The law of delicts is understood in this line of thought as a system with the pur-
pose of protecting the above-named fundamental rights of the individual from 
infringements by others40.
</p>
<p>2.  Limitation of rights by protection of rights
</p>
<p>However, if as explained above one recognises delictual liability in order to protect 
the rights of the victim, this leads to a limitation on the rights of the injuring party.
</p>
<p>a.  Ban on excessivity
</p>
<p>In this context not only are the rights of the injuring party recognised but there 
is also a ban on excessive restriction by the state. Insofar as this ban on excessiv-
ity is not violated, however, protection of the fundamental rights of the victim is 
necessary.
</p>
<p>b.  Meaning of the principle of fault
</p>
<p>Intention and negligence as prerequisites of the present-day law of delicts are un-
derstood as prerequisites for liability that have the specific aim of not excessively

<p>restricting the rights of the injuring party. If liability was imposed on the injuring 
party even when he had not acted intentionally or with negligence, this would be 
an excessive restriction of his rights. Therefore, the principle of fault may be seen 
as a means to prevent such excessive burden.</p>

<p>Part 4 Contractual liability and delictual liability
</p>
<p>I.  Compensation41
</p>
<p>A.  The rule in the Civil Code
1.  Prerequisites for contractual liability
</p>
<p>The prerequisites for a claim to compensation for failure to perform are regulated 
in art 415 CC. According to this provision, when the obligor does not fulfil his obli-
gation fully in accordance with what he owes, the obligee may seek compensation 
for the resulting damage. The same applies when the performance has become 
impossible due to circumstances attributable to the obligor.
</p>
<p>a.  Failure to perform
</p>
<p>Article 415 CC regulates failure to perform in its first sentence and impossibility in 
the second. However, the authors did not intend to distinguish between the two 
cases. Rather, the second sentence was only added because the authors of the Civil 
Code feared that the expression &raquo; failure to perform &laquo; could be misunderstood if it 
were not clear that it included impossibility. The intention of the authors was cer-
tainly that impossibility fall within the term failure to perform.
</p>
<p>b.  Attributability to the obligor
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the attributability to the obligor not only of the impossibility but 
also the failure to perform in general, ie that the obligor be accountable for such, 
was seen as a necessary prerequisite for liability42. Therefore, it is undisputed that 
the prerequisites for a compensation claim due to failure to perform include, on 
the one hand, the failure to perform in itself and, on the other, that this be attrib-
utable to the obligor.

<p>2.  Problems
</p>
<p>However, the respective significance of the two prerequisites is problematic when 
it comes down to detail. This has been the subject of intense debate in Japanese 
legal theory, sometimes also under the influence of foreign legal systems. With re-
spect to the relationship between contractual and delictual liability, it is especially 
the debate on the term failure to perform that is of interest here.
</p>
<p>B.  The term failure to perform
</p>
<p>1.  Differentiation according to the type of failure to perform
</p>
<p>a.  Argumentation
The traditional doctrine43 is based on the type of failure to perform and considers 
that art 415 CC regulates three types of failure to perform, specifically default, im-
possibility and bad performance. Bad performance is understood in this respect 
as including defectiveness of the deliverable, performing in a defective manner 
and lack of the necessary care in rendering performance.
</p>
<p>b.  Reception of the German theory
</p>
<p>This doctrine is quite clearly strongly influenced by German law. The Japanese 
Civil Code does not distinguish, however, per se between these three forms of 
failure to perform but sets out uniform prerequisites for the failure to perform. 
Regardless of this, the traditional doctrine nonetheless interpreted the Japanese 
Civil Code as if it contained the same rules as the German Civil Code ( BGB ). This 
was generally a widespread phenomenon in Japanese legal science from the 1910s 
to the 1930s and is referred to as theory reception44.
</p>
<p>2.  The structure of the obligation relationship as the premise
</p>
<p>a.  Argumentation
</p>
<p>In comparison, the newer theory since the 1960s does not seek to clarify the pre-
requisites of failure to perform on the basis of the type of failure to perform but by 
analysing the duties owed45. For instance, depending on the object of the duty, a

</p>

</p>
<p>distinction is drawn between duties to perform, which concern the interest in the 
performance, and duties to protect, which are directed at the &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo;, 
the protection of the goods of the other partner in the relationship. The former are 
further subdivided into duties to render performance, duties to realise the result 
of performance and ancillary duties.
</p>
<p>b.  Influence of German law
</p>
<p>This theory is very obviously strongly influenced by the theory of irregularities 
of performance ( Leistungsst&ouml;rungen ), developed in Germany after World War II. 
This envisages recognising &raquo; positive Forderungsverletzungen &laquo; ( violations of du-
ties of care between the partners to a contract, other than by delay or supervening 
impossibility ) and breach of contract alongside default and impossibility ( which 
are regulated in the German Civil Code ) as irregularities of performance. This 
means that the crux is what the obligor had promised within the obligation rela-
tionship. The analysis of duties developed from the German theory was also inte-
grated into the construction of failure to perform under art 415 CC in Japan.
</p>
<p>3.  From the uniform failure to perform theory to the theory of 
breach of contract
</p>
<p>a.  Uniform failure to perform theory
</p>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, however, support grew for the view that art 415 of the Japa-
nese Civil Code was based on a different concept to the rule in the German Civil 
Code and that there was no need to construe it according to German law46. Art 415 
CC was considered instead to provide for uniform prerequisities for the external 
elements of failure to perform in respect of cases where the obligor does not per-
form in compliance with the purpose of his obligations. It was argued that there 
was no reason to construe this differently and to distinguish between default, im-
possibility and non-conforming performance. Rather, art 415 CC manifestly in-
cluded non-conforming performance as well as &raquo; positive Forderungsverletzungen &laquo;, 
so that there was no gap to be filled. Thus, so the argument, it is not necessary to 
discuss whether duties to protect must be recognised as a separate category of 
contractual duties, besides the duties to perform. In order to apply art 415 CC, it 
was sufficient to examine whether the obligor had performed consistently with 
the purpose of his obligation or not.

</p>
<p>b.  Theory of breach of contract
</p>
<p>Thus, the decisive question is: what does consistency with the purpose of the obli-
gation mean ? Within the contractual relationship, this is determined by the con-
tract itself. If one proceeds logically from this idea, failure to perform as a prereq-
uisite for a compensation claim under art 415 CC must be understood in the sense 
of a breach of contract47.
</p>
<p>II.  Extension of the contractual duties with respect to 
their object &ndash; protection of the &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo;48
</p>
<p>A.  Problem issue
1.  Violation of the &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo; within the contractual 
</p>
<p>relationship
</p>
<p>Within the contractual relationship, the &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo; of one party may 
be injured by the other. In this context, the question is whether the injured party 
in this case may claim compensation for breach of contractual duties from the 
other. The crux is whether the duties to protect the &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo; of the 
contractual partner, the so-called protective duties, must also be recognised as 
contractual duties.
</p>
<p>2.  Differences between delictual and contractual liability
</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo; is injured, this may also be seen as a case of 
delictual liability. According to the rules on delicts, a claim for compensation is 
barred, however, three years after the time when the victim gained knowledge of 
the damage and identity of the injuring party ( art 724 sent 1 CC ). This is a signifi-
cant difference to contractual liability, according to which the compensation claim 
is prescribed within 10 years after the failure to perform ( art 167 para 1 CC ). For this 
reason it is very important in practice whether the protective duty is recognised as 
a contractual duty or not, in other words whether contractual liability is recognised

<p>due to the violation of this duty. Furthermore, liability for auxiliaries is different 
within the contractual context than in the delictual.
</p>
<p>B.  Reasons for contractual liability
</p>
<p>1.  Structural analysis of the contractual relationship of obligation
</p>
<p>a.  Protective duties as contractual duties
In Japan, those who take their starting premise as the structural analysis of the 
obligation relationship first argued that protective duties must be recognised as 
contractual duties49. In this respect they were influenced by the German theory on 
&raquo; positive Forderungsverletzung &laquo;.
</p>
<p>b.  Establishment of a protective duty
</p>
<p>The idea of the protective duty is based on so-called special connections or social 
contact relationships. The reasoning is that, in such a special relationship, each 
party exposes his &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo; to the influence of the other. In order to 
keep the relationship functioning smoothly, each party must be able to rely on 
his &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo; being especially taken into regard by the other. For this 
reason, parties in such a relationship with each other have a general, mutual ob-
ligation, going beyond the duties of conduct based on the law of delicts, to have 
regard to the &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo; of the respective other party. The parties to a 
contractual relationship thus have precisely this duty, which is referred to here as 
a protective duty.
</p>
<p>2.  Judge-made developments in law &ndash; the duty to have regard for the 
security of the contractual partner
</p>
<p>Under the influence of this theory, case law has also recognised this duty to have 
regard to the security of the contractual partner as a contractual duty.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>a.  Duty of the employer to have regard for the security of  
the employee
</p>
<p>The existence of such a duty was first affirmed in respect of the employment re-
lationship50. According to this school of thought, the employer is bound to have 
regard for the protection of the life and health of the employee against dangers in 
order that the employee can work in safety.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Justification of such duties
The case law invokes the above-mentioned idea of &raquo; social contact relationship &laquo; to 
support the argument that the duty to have regard for the security of the other is a 
general duty deriving from the principle of good faith, which applies to parties in 
such a relationship with one another. It considers this to be true of employment 
relationships, since it is essential that the employer take on such a duty and fulfil 
it for the employee to go about his work without worry.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Scope of the duty
According to the case law, however, this duty consists only in avoiding risks that 
are brought about by persons under the direction of the employer or equipment 
and does not include any general duty of care to protect the life and health of the 
employee51.
</p>
<p>b.  Extension to other contractual relationships
</p>
<p>Subsequently, this duty to have regard for the safety of the contractual partner was 
also applied to the relationship between the principal in a works context and the 
employees of a sub-contractor52 as well as to the relationship between school and 
pupils in the context of a school contract53. In the case law at the lower instances, 
this duty was also recognised in respect of a contract for a swimming course54, an 
accommodation contract55 and a contract on caretaking56.

</p>
<p>3.  The theory of breach of contract
</p>
<p>a.  Determination of the contents of the contract
</p>
<p>According to the theory of breach of contract, on the other hand, the crux is 
whether the protection of the &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo; has become part of the con-
tract57 or not58.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Express agreement
If, for example, the protection of the &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo; is expressly made part 
of the contractual performance, as for instance in the case of a contract for guard-
ing something, then this is part of the duties to perform which one of the parties 
undertakes.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Implicit agreement and completive interpretation of the 
contract ( erg&auml;nzende Vertragsauslegung )
</p>
<p>The same applies when the protection of the &raquo; Integrit&auml;tsinteresse &laquo; is not expressly 
promised but constitutes a prerequisite for the contractual performance. For ex-
ample, it is a necessary prerequisite of an employment contract or a school con-
tract that the employee can work without danger at his workplace or the pupil 
can learn without being exposed to danger at school. Therefore, in this case the 
contract can be interpreted as meaning that it has been promised as part of the 
contract performance that the employee can operate at his workplace or the pupil 
attend the school without danger. Besides this, the purpose of a contract regard-
ing the transport of people will not be fulfilled either solely in having the customer 
brought to the destination but only when he is brought there safely without being 
endangered. In this respect it is also possible to interpret a transportation con-
tract as meaning that the performance promised includes the transportation of 
customers safely to their destination.
</p>
<p>b.  Extent of contractual liability
</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is only necessary to presume a protective duty or duty to safeguard 
the interests of the other as the basis for statutory contractual liability deriving 
from the principle of good faith if the parties are not in a direct contractual rela-
tionship. This is the case, for instance, of the principal in the context of works and 
the employees of a subcontractor. In all other cases the issue can be reduced to 
</p>
<p>57 The case law would be bound to require a valid contract as in the case of culpa in contrahendo 
( see below under III. ) it only advocates applying the law of delicts given the lack of a contract 
( see Supreme Court of 22. 4. 2011, Minsh&ucirc; 65&ndash;3, 1405 ).

of the contractual agreement.
</p>
<p>III.  Extension of contractual duties in the 
chronological context &ndash; culpa in contrahendo59
</p>
<p>A.  Nature of the liability
1.  Culpa in contrahendo
</p>
<p>The idea that legal protection corresponding to contractual liability must be rec-
ognised on the basis of good faith when a party sustains injury in the course of 
contract negotiations as a result of conduct attributable to the other party is also 
known in Japan as the theory of culpa in contrahendo60.
</p>
<p>2.  Necessity for culpa in contrahendo in Japan
</p>
<p>a.  Possibility of categorising it as delictual liability
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is hardly necessary in Japan to construe such liability as contrac-
tual liability. In the Japanese Civil Code, liability for torts is subject to the gen-
eral and uniform external elements establishing liability under art 709 CC, so that 
there is nothing to hinder the categorisation of culpa in contrahendo under liabil-
ity for tort61.
</p>
<p>b.  Practical significance of the different prescription periods
</p>
<p> There are certainly differences with respect to prescription between non-con-
tractual liability on the basis of tortious conduct and contractual liability, namely 
three years from knowledge of damage and the injuring party in the case of the 
former ( art 724 CC ) as compared to ten years from the time when the right may be 
exercised in the case of the latter ( art 166 para 1 and art 167 para 1 CC ). In business

<p>61 The Supreme Court ( of 22. 4. 2011, Minsh&ucirc; 65&ndash;3, 1405 ) decided in a case in which the informa-
tion that would have been necessary in order to decide about concluding a contract was not 
conveyed to the contractual partner prior to conclusion of the contract that, with respect to the 
damage which this contractual party sustained by concluding the contract, there was a duty 
to compensate based on the law of delicts but not due to failure to perform duties under the 
contract.

</p>
<p>relationships, however, liability is usually asserted quickly and this is also reason-
able to expect. Therefore, at least in this respect there is hardly any practical ne-
cessity to extend the prescription period by qualifying liability for culpa in contra-
hendo as contractual liability. It would only make a significant difference insofar 
as liability for auxiliaries is involved.
</p>
<p>B.  Groups of cases when the contract is not concluded
</p>
<p>Culpa in contrahendo firstly comes into question when no contract is concluded. 
In this context, two groups of cases can be distinguished:
</p>
<p>1.  Breaking off of the contract negotiations
</p>
<p>In one group of cases, contract negotiations have been started but later broken 
off again.
</p>
<p>a.  Case law
</p>
<p>According to the case law62, the parties already have duties of care towards the per-
son and assets of the other party even at the stage of contract negotiations, these 
duties arising out of the principle of good faith. If one party violates these duties 
and the other sustains damage as a consequence, the former has a duty to com-
pensate. Accordingly, a party that induces the other to rely on something by its 
conduct and thus causes this other party to undertake unnecessary expenses or 
efforts or make legal dispositions on this basis must compensate the damage that 
the other party suffers as a consequence of this disappointment of its reliance, ie 
reliance damages.
</p>
<p>b.  Theory of &raquo; degree of maturity of the contract &laquo;
</p>
<p>The more recent theory, however, sees such liability when the contract negotia-
tions are broken off nonetheless as the consequence of an agreement in a broader 
sense63. According to this, it is usual at least in the case of financially significant 
agreements that the final contract is accomplished by means of a sequence of

</p>
<p>agreements regarding individual issues during the course of the contract nego-
tiations. The liability of a party when the negotiations are broken off is, therefore, 
to be regarded as a consequence of the breach of one of such interim agreements. 
The scope of the liability thus depends on the respective content of the cumula-
tive interim agreements, the so-called &raquo; degree of maturity of the contract &laquo;. If, for 
instance, the content of the contract to be concluded has already been established 
in the negotiations and only the contract documents remained to be drafted, it 
should be possible to seek expectation damages.
</p>
<p>2.  Accident in the course of concluding the contract
</p>
<p>In the second group of cases, the rights of one party are injured by a damaging 
event in the course of the conclusion of the contract. However, this is nothing 
other than a case of tort, so that there is nothing to stop art 709 CC being applied.
</p>
<p>C.  Groups of cases when a contract is concluded
</p>
<p>Liability for culpa in contrahendo is also relevant in cases where the contract has 
been concluded. Here too, two groups of cases must be distinguished:
</p>
<p>1.  Ineffectiveness of the contract
</p>
<p>The first group includes cases in which a contract has been concluded but later 
turns out to be ineffective.
</p>
<p>a.  Establishment of liability
</p>
<p>In this case too, the prevailing theory is that the party whose conduct caused the 
other to rely on the effectiveness of the contract must compensate such for the re-
sulting damage. This is based on the idea that, owing to the principle of good faith, 
each party is obliged to take care during the conclusion of a contract that the other 
does not suffer damage as a result of an ineffective contract being concluded64.
</p>
<p>b.  Scope of liability
</p>
<p>In this case the damage that the other partner sustains as a result of disappointed 
reliance upon the validity of the contract must be compensated, ie reliance dam-

<p>ages. This includes frustrated expenses, for example or damage that results from 
rejecting a different, more favourable offer.
</p>
<p>2.  Inadmissible inducement to conclude a contract
</p>
<p>The second group includes cases where the contractual partner has been induced 
during the course of concluding the contract in an inadmissible manner to enter 
into a contract he does not desire. The culpa in contrahendo includes in this re-
spect especially cases in which the other partner has been misled by insufficient 
or inappropriate information and thus caused to enter into a contract that does 
not correspond to his intentions.
</p>
<p>a.  Problem issue
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Duty to inform
It is a prerequisite for liability in this case that a so-called duty to inform is estab-
lished, ie a duty to disclose necessary information to the other party when con-
cluding the contract. Such a duty to inform is in general inferred from the princi-
ple of good faith65. In this respect it is assumed that the parties that conduct the 
contract negotiations with each other are in a close relationship to which the prin-
ciple of good faith applies.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Basis of the duty to inform
If such a duty is broadly interpreted, however, this could contravene the contrac-
tual law principle of responsibility for one&rsquo;s own affairs. In business relations, 
each party must in principle look after the protection of his own interests and 
thus independently obtain information and avert disadvantageous circumstances. 
Thus, the question is under what circumstances and for what reasons inappropri-
ate information from the contractual partner can be regarded as a violation of the 
principle of good faith. In this respect two aspects must be distinguished, namely 
not providing false information and communicating necessary information66.

<p>b.  Duty to inform as a duty not to do something
</p>
<p>On the one hand, there is the situation where one party has provided incorrect 
information to the other. The following two considerations support the idea of a 
duty not to give false information:
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Danger posed by false information
Firstly, a decision is automatically inappropriate when it is based on false informa-
tion, even if the relevant party also understood the information provided correctly. 
False information creates a substantial risk that the other party will be induced as 
a consequence to make a wrong decision.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Imputability
Secondly, it is natural that the party providing the information be accountable for 
this when he himself gave the false information.
</p>
<p>c.  Duty to inform as a duty of conduct
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is also the situation where one party does not provide 
the other with necessary information. In turn, two considerations in this respect 
support the assumption of a duty to provide the other with necessary information:
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Prohibition on damaging others
One consideration concerns information regarding dangers. If it is foreseeable 
that the contractual partner will be exposed to a risk of damage to his legal goods, 
specifically his body, life or assets, it must be assumed that there is a duty to in-
form the contractual party about this danger. In any other case, the legal position 
of the contractual partner would already be impaired at the time the contract was 
concluded due to the lack of information.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Liability of experts
Furthermore, a duty to inform must also be assumed when it comes to the rela-
tionship between experts and laypersons, for the following reasons.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Restoration&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;actual&emsp;freedom&emsp;to&emsp;contract
</p>
<p>Firstly, when it comes to transactions entered into between an expert party and a 
non-expert party, there is a gap in information, meaning there is a large risk that 
the layperson could enter into a disadvantageous deal without noticing it. This 
means that in effect the layperson sacrifices his freedom to contract in a sense. In 
order to actually restore the layperson&rsquo;s freedom to contract, it is necessary to im-
pose a duty to inform upon the expert partner.

him&emsp;by&emsp;society
</p>
<p>Secondly, the business activities of experts are only facilitated in the first place 
by the trust of society in their professional abilities. It is therefore only right and 
proper that the expert not only draw an advantage from this but that he also bear 
a correspondingly higher degree of responsibility.
</p>
<p>d.  Development from delictual to transaction-based liability
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Solution under the law of delicts
If, as just explained above, such a duty to inform is recognised, when this duty is 
breached, there is both wrongfulness and fault, meaning that delictual liability 
can be affirmed. And indeed, the lower instances did usually find there was delict-
ual liability in the judgments on consumer disputes that arose frequently in the 
1980s and 1990s as well as on investment deals.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Scope&emsp;of&emsp;liability
</p>
<p>The compensation awarded in this respect included the reimbursement of ex-
penses that were incurred due to the undesired contract which the party was in-
duced to conclude as a result of false information. Compensating this damage 
means the victim is restored to the position he would have been in had no contract 
been concluded. This is often referred to as compensation with restorative effect67. 
One could also say that this duty to compensate essentially negates the effective-
ness of the contract.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Shortcomings&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;rules&emsp;governing&emsp;legal&emsp;transactions
</p>
<p>This approach was chosen since, due to the strict rules in the Civil Code regarding 
legal transactions, the prerequisites for ineffectiveness or recission of the contract 
in such cases seem difficult to fulfil.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Solution at the level of the legal transaction
(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;T3heoretical&emsp;approach
</p>
<p>However, there is a contradiction in values if, on the one hand, the contract is seen 
as effective, but on the other, it is treated in the course of compensation as if it 
were not. This is why the theory advocates relaxing the prerequisites in these cases 
as regards rescinding contracts for deceit or misrepresentation and / or by a broad

<p>Against the background of this development in case law and theory, the Consumer 
Contract Law promulgated in 200069 grants the consumer a right to rescind the 
contract if he was misled by the entrepreneur engaging in particular, positive ac-
tions ( art 4 Consumer Contract Law ). However, the Consumer Contract Law does 
not provide for rescission in the case of violations of the duty to inform in the 
sense of a duty of conduct70. At present the Consumer Contract Law is being re-
formed and the recognition of such a duty will be debated anew.

<p>Part 5 The basic prerequisites for delictual liability
</p>
<p>I.  Damage
</p>
<p>A.  The concept of damage
</p>
<p>In Japan, which in principle does not have restitution in kind, the concept of dam-
age which is to be measured in money is discussed and described below:
</p>
<p>1.  Calculable damage &ndash; difference method ( Differenzmethode )
</p>
<p>Traditionally, damage was seen as the monetary difference between the condition 
of the victim&rsquo;s interests as they would presently be had there been no tort and the 
condition of his interests as they are now due to the tort71. Thus, damage is re-
garded as the monetary harm sustained by the victim.
</p>
<p>The question is therefore how the monetary difference between the two con-
ditions is calculated.
</p>
<p>a.  Accumulation of individual heads of damage
</p>
<p>Even when the difference relates to the overall assets, in practice the difference 
can still only be calculated by taking each individual head of damage and then 
adding these together. The most important heads of damage in this respect are 
the following:
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Pecuniary damage
These are firstly the pecuniary ( material ) disadvantages arising due to the tort. 
They can further be divided into positive damage ( actual loss ) and negative dam-
age ( lucrum cessans ).
</p>
<p>71 Among the advocates of the Difference Method there are those who see the difference between 
the conditions of the interests as damage ( comparison of the actual conditions ), and those 
who see the difference between the respective sums of the assets as the damage ( monetary 
comparison ). In Japan, however, it is not always the case that a clear distinction is made be-
tween these two standpoints.

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Actual&emsp;loss&emsp;(&emsp;damnum&emsp;emergens&emsp;)
There is actual damage when the victim&rsquo;s existing assets are actively reduced by 
the tort. If someone&rsquo;s life or bodily integrity are injured, this may include expenses 
such as medical costs ( of treatment, hospital stays, caregiving, rehabilitation, etc ) 
as well as the costs of converting the victim&rsquo;s home; when things are damaged, 
this may include repair costs or the expense of procuring a replacement. The re-
duction in the value of the damaged goods is also taken into account.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Negative&emsp;damage&emsp;(&emsp;lucrum&emsp;cessans&emsp;)
</p>
<p>Negative damage, on the other hand, is when it was to be expected that the victim&rsquo;s 
assets would grow but this does not happen due to the tort. Lost profit falls into 
this category.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Non-pecuniary damage
Besides pecuniary damage, non-pecuniary damage can also arise as a result of the 
tort.
</p>
<p>b.  Assessment
</p>
<p>In respect of the individual heads of damage, the following methods of assess-
ment are applied.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Pecuniary damage
With respect to pecuniary damage, the difference is determined on the basis of the 
costs that really accrued and / or the amount that was really lost in respect of each 
head of damage. The underlying principle is the compensation of the actual damage.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Non-pecuniary damage
When it comes to non-pecuniary damage, on the other hand, there are no actual 
expenses or income to take as the basis; instead the assessment must be made at 
the judge&rsquo;s discretion taking into account all relevant circumstances, including 
the gravity of the injury.
</p>
<p>c.  Problem issue
</p>
<p>The following criticisms have been levelled at the difference method.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Methodological fuzziness
The theory is criticised for mixing the assessment of the damage in monetary 
terms with the determination and recoverability of the damage, leaving it unclear 
what has been determined in what manner.

(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Damage&emsp;not&emsp;measurable&emsp;in&emsp;money
</p>
<p>If damage is understood solely as a quantifiable difference expressed in money, 
any damage that cannot be expressed in monetary terms remains disregarded. 
This is the case, for example, when the victim is injured by the tort but does not 
suffer any loss of actual income.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Harm&emsp;not&emsp;included&emsp;in&emsp;the&emsp;heads&emsp;of&emsp;damage
</p>
<p>If the damage is determined by adding together the individual heads of damage 
and, in particular if the catalogue of damage is seen as fixed, it may also be the 
case that damage is not included. While the difference method proceeds on the 
basis that the damage can be comprehensively determined, in reality a compre-
hensive assessment cannot be made.
</p>
<p>2.  Damage as actual damage
</p>
<p>Nowadays, however, one influential view distinguishes between damage and dam-
age assessment and uses the expression &raquo; damage &laquo; only to refer to an actual state 
but not the assessment of the harm suffered in money. Thus, a distinction is made 
between the determination that damage has occurred as well as &ndash; taking into ac-
count the protective scope &ndash; the recoverability of such, on the one hand, and the 
assessment in money, on the other and these two steps are carried out consecu-
tively72.
</p>
<p>a.  Concrete damage
</p>
<p>In this respect, it is firstly conceivable that the actual individual impairments to 
the victim&rsquo;s interests be seen as the damage73.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Concept of damage
(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Personal&emsp;injury
</p>
<p>Applying this view, the following facts could, for instance, be seen as damage in 
the case of personal injury: the fact that the victim, due to the necessity of going 
to hospital for treatment, must now pay the hospital stay and treatment; the fact 
that, after being discharged from hospital, the victim had to go for rehabilitation 
for three months and had to pay the rehabilitation clinic; the fact that the victim 
is now confined to a wheelchair and had consequently to adapt his home and pay

<p>a construction company to do so; the fact that the victim, who is self-employed, 
could not work for three months due to the tort and has lost income accordingly.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Damage&emsp;to&emsp;property
</p>
<p>In the case of damage to property, the following facts are examples of what may 
be regarded as damage: the fact that the victim&rsquo;s motorbike had to be repaired in 
a garage as a result of the tort ( traffic accident ) and the victim had to pay for the 
repair costs; or the fact that the victim lost his motorbike as a result of the tort and 
had to buy a new one from a dealer.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Assessment
The amount of damages is assessed as follows using this approach.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Determination&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;damage
</p>
<p>Firstly, it is necessary as outlined above to determine a fact that constitutes dam-
age. Thus, facts amounting to the ( cumulative ) heads of damage under the differ-
ence method are regarded as damage.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Extent&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;damages
</p>
<p>Secondly, it is necessary to assess whether the facts amounting to damage de-
termined above can be regarded as damage brought about by the infringement 
of a right. This corresponds to the examination under the difference method of 
whether there is an adequate causal link between the damage and the infringe-
ment of the right.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;iii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Assessment&emsp;in&emsp;money
</p>
<p>Thirdly, the facts amounting to damage which fall within the recoverable scope 
must be evaluated in monetary terms. This corresponds to the calculation of the 
difference in amount using the difference method.
</p>
<p>(   3  )   Criticism
However, if concrete facts that correspond to the heads of damage are regarded 
as damage, it may happen that harm which cannot be identified in terms of such 
facts is not considered. Besides the case that the victim is injured by a tort but 
does not suffer any loss of income, regard must also be had to situations such as 
when a traumatised victim has in fact given up riding a motorbike due to an ac-
cident.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>b.  Comprehensive concept of damage
</p>
<p>Nowadays nonetheless, among the ranks of the advocates of the actual damage 
concept, a view that emphasises the purpose of restoring the original condition 
and &ndash; in contrast to the above-described doctrine of concrete damage &ndash; catego-
rises all harm brought about by the tort comprehensively as damage, has become 
influential.
</p>
<p>B.  The relationship between infringement of a right and damage
</p>
<p>If all harm that arises due to a tort is comprehensively regarded as damage in line 
with this view, the question arises whether a distinction must be made between 
this damage and the infringement of the ( subjective ) right.
</p>
<p>1.  Equation of infringement of a right with damage
</p>
<p>One view is that there is no distinction to be drawn between infringement of a 
right and damage. According to this, examining the causal link giving rise to li-
ability and the determination of the extent of recoverable damage fall together. In 
this respect, there are differences in opinion as to whether the damage must be 
seen as the impairment of an interest or a value.
</p>
<p>a.  Doctrine of impairment of an interest
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Concept of damage
Firstly, it is conceivable that the impairments of any and all interests due to an in-
fringement of a right are to be regarded as damage74.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Determination and calculation of the damage
The determination and calculation of the damage then ensues as follows:
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Basic&emsp;rule
aa.	 	Determination	of	the	damage	&ndash;	addition	of	the	individual	
</p>
<p>heads	of	damage
</p>
<p>As the entire loss as such cannot be determined, the harm must be determined in 
respect of each head of damage and then added together to arrive at the overall 
damage.

</p>
<p>bb.	 	Assessment	of	damage
</p>
<p>On this basis the concrete impairment of interest is calculated for each individual 
head of damage in line with the actual income and expenses.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Exception
</p>
<p>If, however, part of the damage cannot be taken into consideration within the 
framework of the individual heads of damage, this will be determined by free dis-
cretion via damages for pain and suffering.
</p>
<p>b.  Loss in value
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is argued that the reduction in the value of a right due to 
the infringement of the right constitutes damage. The question that arises here is 
at which level the value of the subjective right must be evaluated, ie whether the 
evaluation should be abstract or concrete.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Abstract value &ndash; death and bodily injury
One view taken is that, in the case of personal injury, death and bodily injury con-
stitute damage and should be evaluated by a fixed amount as a standard type of 
damage. This is based above all on the equality of people and the dignity of the 
individual and on the principle that people cannot be seen as the source of pecu-
niary interests but as beings who have an inherent, equal value75.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Understanding&emsp;of&emsp;damage
</p>
<p>This view understands the bodily injury or death of a person as ( non-pecuniary ) 
damage. If there is a causal link between the damaging conduct and the bodily 
injury or death ( this corresponds to causation as a prerequisite for liability ), then 
said bodily injury or death constitutes recoverable damage.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Assessment&emsp;of&emsp;damage
</p>
<p>The value lost due to death or bodily injury, ie the value of the life or body, is eval-
uated in each case by a fixed amount. This means, therefore, that the difference 
method is rejected as it relies on expenses actually incurred; in its place comes a 
standard fixed scale for the amount of compensation in accordance with the ob-
jective injury to the value of life or of bodily integrity.

<p>(   2  )   Concrete value &ndash; reduction in earning capacity
In contrast, it is also argued that any loss of capacity to earn on the part of the 
victim must be regarded as damage and individually evaluated &ndash; ie taking into ac-
count the circumstances of the specific victim76.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Understanding&emsp;of&emsp;damage
</p>
<p>This view sees the reduction of capacity to earn due to bodily injury as damage. 
Even if in fact no difference has manifested with respect to the income and ex-
penses accruing, the reduction of earning capacity as such is recognised as damage.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Assessment&emsp;of&emsp;damage
</p>
<p>Therefore, the value of the lost earning capacity is measured in money. Any stand-
ard sum in this respect is rejected as earning capacity is different for every victim.
</p>
<p>2.  Differentiation between infringement of a right and damage &ndash; 
normative concept of damage
</p>
<p>Another view contends in this context that a distinction must be drawn between 
infringement of a right and damage. According to this view, the question of which 
damage arose from the infringement of a right and to what extent this must be 
compensated must thus be examined separately from the causation giving rise to 
liability77.
</p>
<p>a.  Normative concept of damage
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Understanding of damage &ndash; comparison of normative 
circumstances
</p>
<p>According to this view, the damage consists in the difference between the victim&rsquo;s 
circumstances as they would now be had the tort not occurred ( A ) and the victim&rsquo;s 
circumstances as they actually are due to the tort ( B ).
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Coincidence of damage determination and assessment of 
compensation
</p>
<p>Neither A nor B are natural facts, rather they are normative facts based on a le-
gal evaluation. Consequently, determining the actual condition and the circum-
stances as they would have been in the absence of the tort, ie by determining the 
damage, also determines the extent of the compensation.

</p>
<p>b.  Gradation of the concept of damage
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the question is how to assess what the victim&rsquo;s condition would have 
been in the absence of the damaging action.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Minimum damage &ndash; loss of value
As the minimum damage the value of the infringed right usually constitutes the 
recoverable damage.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Grounds&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;continuation&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;right&emsp;function&emsp;
(&emsp;Rechtsfortsetzungsfunktion&emsp;)&emsp;of&emsp;compensation
</p>
<p>A claim to compensation due to an infringement of a right leads to compensation 
of the value in respect of the actual right. Therefore, the state that would have ex-
isted had the value of the right not been violated corresponds to state A ( condition 
of the victim as it would now be had there been no tort ).
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Determining&emsp;the&emsp;damage&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;abstract&emsp;calculation&emsp;of&emsp;damage
</p>
<p>In such a case the damage is determined by looking away from the actual concrete 
facts and estimating the value of the lost right, ie the value of life or bodily integ-
rity or the value of a property right, in objective-abstract monetary terms.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Additional damage &ndash; impairment of individual interests
However, when it comes to impairment of an interest that rests on the individual 
circumstances of the victim and for which no compensation would be due pursu-
ant to the above principles, additional compensation is granted besides the mini-
mum damage.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Equation&emsp;of&emsp;determination&emsp;of&emsp;damage&emsp;with&emsp;determination&emsp;of&emsp;
extent&emsp;of&emsp;damage
</p>
<p>In this case the damage is seen as the sum of individual heads of damage in the 
sense of the method where the individual heads of damage are added together. For 
instance, with respect to expenses that were forced upon the victim due to the tort, 
the question of whether damage is recoverable is assessed based on the necessity 
of such expenses. As far as income that the victim could have earned is concerned 
had the tort not ensued, the question of whether this is recoverable damage de-
pends on the probability of such income.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Determination&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;damage&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;concrete&emsp;calculation&emsp;of&emsp;
damage
</p>
<p>The impairment of interest determined in line with the above is assessed in mon-
etary terms with regard to the concrete circumstances.

<p>C.  Non-pecuniary damage and compensation for pain and suffering
</p>
<p>The Japanese law of delicts sets no limit as to the types of recoverable damage. 
Non-pecuniary damage is recognised as being recoverable as a matter of course. 
This is usually compensated in the form of damages for pain and suffering.
</p>
<p>1.  Purpose of damages for pain and suffering
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is controversy as to the purpose of damages for pain and suf-
fering.
</p>
<p>a.  Theory of restoration to the earlier state
</p>
<p>In general, the purpose of damages for pain and suffering is seen as being to com-
pensate the damage the victim sustained and restore a state corresponding as far 
as possible to the original state.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Actual function
However, the views diverge on what constitutes damage or indeed the restoration 
of the earlier state in such cases.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Compensation&emsp;of&emsp;non-pecuniary&emsp;damage&emsp;(&emsp;pain&emsp;)
</p>
<p>Traditionally, the purpose of damages for pain and suffering is seen as being to 
compensate psychological or bodily pain. Nonetheless, there are in turn different 
views on how damages for pain and suffering can effect compensation of the pain.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Compensation	of	damage
</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is argued that by means of damages for pain and suffering 
non-pecuniary harm is compensated by money78.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Satisfaction
On the other hand, it is also argued that there is satisfaction in the monetary com-
pensation which in turn restores the emotional balance79. Non-pecuniary damage 
( pain ) cannot be measured in money. Therefore, it is argued that is it not possible 
to speak of such harm being compensated. Thus, instead it is only possible to see 
the damages as providing emotional satisfaction and thus restoration of the lost 
emotional balance.

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Impairment&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;non-pecuniary&emsp;value
Besides this it is also argued that damages for pain and suffering have the purpose 
of compensating the impairment of a non-pecuniary value, which the victim pos-
sessed. In this context, a distinction is also drawn as to which value is regarded as 
impaired.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Infringement	of	an	emotional	value
On the one hand, it is argued that human feelings have an objective value and that 
the impairment of this value is compensated in money80. This also explains com-
pensation to people who are not in a position to feel pain ( eg infants ), as well as 
standard rates for pain and suffering.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Impairment	of	the	right	to	an	undisturbed	life
On the other hand, it is also possible to recognise a right to an undisturbed life 
and to see the damages for pain and suffering as compensation for the impair-
ment of this value in monetary terms. If one proceeds from the basis of the right 
to pursue happiness to a right to an undisturbed life, then compensation is neces-
sary when there is a forced change to this everyday life or life planning. However, 
a continuation of the infringement of the right to an undisturbed life is also pos-
sible even after the tort against the victim has ended. Therefore, when assessing 
damages for pain and suffering, the conduct of the injuring party after the actual 
damaging conduct must also be taken into consideration.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Supplementary function
Further, in practice damages for pain and suffering are frequently drawn on in a 
supplementary fashion when it is difficult to prove pecuniary damage. The follow-
ing reasons come into play.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Inevitability
If the damage is calculated by adding together the individual heads of damage and 
on the basis of the concrete damage, evidence problems are inevitable and require 
a resolution.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Procedural&emsp;reasons
As, furthermore, claims for pecuniary damage and non-pecuniary damage are 
treated as one suit, the claimant is not bound to a breakdown of the individual 
heads of damage as long as the amount of damages remains within the amount 
claimed. Therefore, damages for pain and suffering can be drawn on to supple-
ment the compensation for pecuniary damage.

</p>
<p>b.  Sanction and deterrence
</p>
<p>By contrast, it is also argued that damages for pain and suffering fulfil a sanction-
ing and deterrence function81.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Reasoning
According to this view, imposing penalties does not always provide sufficient sanc-
tioning and deterrent effects on its own. It is argued that granting very high dam-
ages to the victim, which have precisely that aim, is more effective.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Criticism
In response to this view, however, the following criticism is levelled82.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Strict&emsp;distinction&emsp;between&emsp;civil&emsp;and&emsp;criminal&emsp;law
</p>
<p>The Japanese legal system is based on a separation between the civil law of dam-
ages, on the one hand, and criminal and administrative law rules, on the other 
hand83. Therefore, it is argued that it would be irreconcilable with the Japanese le-
gal system to openly recognise a sanctioning and deterrence function for the civil 
law of damages.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Interference&emsp;with&emsp;the&emsp;balancing&emsp;of&emsp;interests
aa.	 	Excessive	protection	of	the	victim
</p>
<p>Compensating the actual damage protects the rights of the victim. There is no le-
gitimate interest in receiving any compensation going beyond this. If the law of 
damages was used in order to sanction and deter, this would mean that the victim 
would receive an advantage exceeding the compensation of the damage sustained.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Excessive	interference	towards	injuring	party
</p>
<p>Furthermore, duties to compensate cannot be randomly justified by the aim of 
sanctioning and deterring damaging conduct as the injuring party also has rights 
that may not be excessively restricted.

</p>
<p>2.  Calculation of the damages for pain and suffering
</p>
<p>a.  Concrete assessment
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Procedure
</p>
<p>The judge determines the damages for pain and suffering at his discretion; the 
circumstances that have been established in the oral hearing must be taken into 
consideration. The judge is not obliged to set out the grounds for his assessment 
in this respect84. On the other hand, neither does the victim have any duty of proof 
with respect to the amount of damages for pain and suffering85.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Circumstances that must be taken into account
The following circumstances must be taken into account when assessing the dam-
ages for pain and suffering.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Circumstances&emsp;connected&emsp;with&emsp;the&emsp;unlawful&emsp;act
</p>
<p>Firstly, the circumstances connected with the unlawful act must be taken into ac-
count. On the side of the victim, these include the conduct of the victim, whether 
there was fault on the part of the victim and the gravity of such. With respect to 
the injuring party, this refers to the purpose and motive for the unlawful act as 
well as the conduct ( intention, negligence, etc ).
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Circumstances&emsp;regarding&emsp;the&emsp;parties
</p>
<p>Secondly, the circumstances of the parties must be taken into account. Besides the 
age, profession and societal position of the victim and the injuring party, these in-
clude the financial situation and conduct of the injuring party.
</p>
<p>b.  Standard rates &ndash; fixed amounts for pain and suffering
</p>
<p>For typical torts, such as road traffic accidents, there are guidelines for determin-
ing the damages for pain and suffering in standard cases, ie where there are no 
special circumstances86. When the main breadwinner of a family dies, these range 
between JPY 27 and 31 million, for example; when someone who is to be held 
equivalent to the main breadwinner is killed this is between JPY 24 and 27 million 
and in other cases between JPY 20 and 24 million.
</p>

85 Cf ia Imperial Court of 20. 12. 1901, Keiroku 7&ndash;11, 105.
86 The reason why the sum is particularly high for death of a breadwinner is that the element of 
</p>
<p>compensation for loss of support payments to the bereaved is included.

<p>D.  Damage through unwanted birth of a child
</p>
<p>In Japan the question of damage due to the unwanted birth of a child has not yet 
arisen in practice. Therefore, this problem has not yet been discussed separately 
in Japan; instead there is only reference to the debate abroad.
</p>
<p>II.  Causation
</p>
<p>A.  Concept of causation
1.  General meaning of causation
</p>
<p>Causation means that there is a cause and effect relationship between fact A and 
fact B.
</p>
<p>2.  Relationship of cause and effect
</p>
<p>However, it is questionable how a relationship of cause and effect is interpreted 
with respect to the causation of a tort.
</p>
<p>a.  Difference between causation and limitation of imputation
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Adequate causation
According to the traditional teaching87 and case law88 &ndash; as under German law &ndash; it is 
a prerequisite for delictual liability that there be an adequate causal link between 
the injuring act and the result.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Three-step model
This means that, when evaluating whether there was adequate causation, the 
question of limitation of imputation and damage assessment is also decided. The 
meanwhile prevailing counter-view considers, however, that this makes the evalu-
ation unclear and advocates examining these questions separately, specifically in 
three steps89.

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Factual&emsp;causation
First it must be established whether the injuring action actually caused the result 
at issue ( infringement of a right or damage ) and thus, whether there is factually a 
causal relationship.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Protective&emsp;scope
</p>
<p>The second step is a legal evaluation to examine whether the result ( infringement 
of a right or damage ) that is factually linked to the injuring act can be imputed to 
the injuring party.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;iii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Assessment&emsp;in&emsp;money
</p>
<p>The third step is to assess the damage that falls within the protective scope in 
monetary terms.
</p>
<p>b.  The nature of the causation test
</p>
<p>This limits the examination of causation to the question of whether there is a fac-
tual causal link.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Evaluative assessment
It is generally recognised that this test is not a factual question in the sense of a 
natural sciences type test but necessarily includes an element of evaluation. The 
existence of a causal link is determined by reference to a regularity ( Gesetzm&auml;&szlig;ig-
keit ) in that it is evaluated whether this regularity applies to a certain factual phe-
nomenon or not. An evaluative element is inevitable in this context.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Factual aspect of the test
Nonetheless, it is ultimately an assessment of whether there is a factual causal 
relationship and, thus, it must be distinguished from the legal evaluation with re-
spect to the protective scope.
</p>
<p>B.  Test
</p>
<p>Causation generally means that there is a cause and effect relationship between 
fact A and fact B.
</p>
<p>1.  Test yardstick
</p>
<p>How to determine whether there is a causal relationship between the injuring act 
and the result ( infringement of a right or damage ) is controversial.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>a.  Necessary condition
</p>
<p>Traditionally, there was considered to be a factual causal link if one fact consti-
tuted a conditio sine qua non for the other fact90. This is based on the idea that the 
injuring party is also liable if there are several causes for a particular result con-
sisting in an infringement of a right provided the injuring party&rsquo;s act is a neces-
sary condition for the occurrence of said result.
</p>
<p>b.  A regularity
</p>
<p>In contrast, however, one influential school of thought holds that the existence 
of a factual causal link must be assessed according to whether, on the basis of a 
generally accepted regularity, it may be assumed that A is the cause of B91. This is 
based on the idea that, insofar as there is a general persuasion as to what is the 
cause of result B, that is a regularity applies, it is sufficient to assess on this basis 
whether A is the cause of B.
</p>
<p>2.  Starting points for causation &ndash; cause and effect
</p>
<p>Whichever school of thought one follows, both require that, in order to assess 
whether there is a causal relationship, it is necessary that there is a fact ( A ), which 
is the cause, and a fact ( B ), which is the result.
</p>
<p>a.  Cause &ndash; injuring party&rsquo;s conduct
</p>
<p>Intentional or negligent conduct on the part of the injuring party come into ques-
tion as the starting point for the causation test92.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Action
In the case of an action this works as follows.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Starting&emsp;point&emsp;for&emsp;causation
</p>
<p>The starting point for the causation is action A, which offends against a duty to 
omit ( &raquo; do not do A &laquo; ). For example, the starting point can be an action that offends 
against the duty of conduct: &raquo; do not make any mistakes in medical treatment &laquo;, ie 
an action on the part of the injuring party that constitutes medical mistreatment.

<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Meaning&emsp;of&emsp;causation
In such a case the causation must be recognised according to the formula of the 
necessary condition ( conditio sine qua non ): B would not have occurred, had A 
not happened. If the victim in the above example would not have been disabled, 
for example, were it not for the medical error, then causation must be recognised.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Omission
In the case of an omission, however, it is controversial whether a causal relation-
ship is required.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;No&emsp;necessity&emsp;for&emsp;causation
</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is argued that, in the case of omissions, no causation is con-
ceivable and therefore a tort may be assumed regardless of a causal link93. This 
is because, in the case of an omission, an injuring party has in fact done nothing 
and, thus, there cannot be any conduct of A which may be regarded as the start-
ing point for the causal relationship. This is why only the breach of the duty of 
conduct would be material, it is argued. However, this is a question of fault. This 
would mean that, in case of fault, liability should be recognised.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Necessity&emsp;of&emsp;causation
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is also argued that, even in the case of an omission, it is defi-
nitely conceivable that there be a causal relationship and that delictual liability 
ought only to be recognised if such exists94.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Starting	point	for	a	causal	relationship
</p>
<p>According to this view, the omission A, which offends against a duty of conduct 
( &raquo; do A &laquo; ) is the starting point for the causal relationship. Thus, an omission that of-
fends, for example, against the duty of conduct, &raquo; in order to diagnose liver cancer, 
carry out an effective examination &laquo;, ie if no effective examination has been con-
ducted in order to recognise liver cancer, is the starting point for the causation test.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Meaning	of	causation
</p>
<p>According to the formula of the necessary condition, therefore, causation must be 
recognised in this case when B would not have happened had A been done. For ex-
ample, if the victim would not have died had an effective examination to diagnose 
liver cancer been carried out, causation must be recognised95.

</p>
<p>b.  Result &ndash; infringement of a right
</p>
<p>The result which represents the end of the causal link is an infringement of the 
victim&rsquo;s rights. In the event that the victim is killed, however, a series of infringe-
ments of rights can be identified, in respect of each of which the question of the 
causal link arises.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Death &ndash; infringement of the right to life
If the victim dies, this can be seen as an infringement of the right to life.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Existence&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;causal&emsp;link
</p>
<p>If the victim suffers, for instance, from cirrhosis of the liver and it can be estab-
lished that appropriate medical treatment ( effective examination to diagnose liver 
cancer ) would have prevented his death, then there is a causal link.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Non-existence&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;causal&emsp;link
</p>
<p>If the victim falls ill with angina pectoris and it cannot be established that appro-
priate medical intervention ( administration of nitroglycerine, a substance used 
to treat angina pectoris ) would have saved his life, then no causal link can be rec-
ognised.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Premature death &ndash; reduction of life expectancy
The death of the victim may also be regarded as a loss of life expectancy.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Life&emsp;expectancy&emsp;as&emsp;a&emsp;protected&emsp;legal&emsp;good
</p>
<p>The most fundamental interest of a human is to retain his life and this constitutes 
an interest that is legally protected ( a legal good or right )96. Therefore, if there was 
expectancy of a longer life and this is destroyed by medical malpractice, then this 
may be seen as the infringement of a right and thus as a tort.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Existence&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;causal&emsp;link
</p>
<p>Therefore, if it can be established that appropriate medical treatment ( eg admin-
istration of nitroglycerine to treat angina pectoris ) would at least have saved the 
victim from dying at that point in time, then the causal link must be recognised97 
and compensation is payable for the reduction of life expectancy98.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>C.  Competing causes
</p>
<p>The issue becomes problematic, however, when several causes have brought about 
the result, specifically in the following two cases.
</p>
<p>1.  The competing cause is a force of nature
</p>
<p>a.  Problem issue
</p>
<p>One case is when the unlawful act by the perpetrator competes as a cause with 
forces of nature. This problem arose, for instance, in the following situation: 
due to ongoing heavy rain there was a mudslide on a public street ( ie one built 
and administered by the state ). As the state did not notify citizens of this in time, 
however, a tourist bus with victim X on board continued along the street with no 
knowledge of the mudslide and had to stop when it got that far. The heavy rain 
caused another slide and the tourist bus was swept away and X killed.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Ground for liability
Since in this case the injuring party ( the state ) had not passed on information 
quickly enough and blocked the street, it is possible to speak of defectiveness with 
respect to the &raquo; construction and administration of a public construction &laquo; so that 
liability for a structure under art 2 para 1 State Redress Act may be applicable.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Legal interpretation
However, in this case there is not only a defectiveness in the construction and ad-
ministration of a structure on the part of the injuring party ( the state ), natural 
forces ( mudslide due to heavy rains ) have also contributed to the occurrence of 
the relevant result ( infringement of a right or damage ). The question here is how 
this should be taken into account in respect of the prerequisites for and legal con-
sequences of liability.
</p>
<p>b.  Causation
</p>
<p>Firstly, it is controversial whether this can even be seen as a causation issue.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Quantitative understanding of causation &ndash; proportional 
causation
</p>
<p>One view holds that when several causes have contributed to the occurrence of 
a result, the causation must be determined under consideration of the extent to

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>which each individual cause contributed99. Hence, causation is treated as a quan-
titative issue, namely how much each cause contributed to the occurrence of the 
result. If the proportionate contribution of the forces of nature ( eg 40 % ) is de-
ducted, then the causal link between the defectiveness of the structure and the 
administration of the street and the result must be recognised in respect of the 
remaining share100.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Qualitative understanding of causation
Generally, however, it is assumed that there is causation if B would not have hap-
pened had it not been for A, so that the causal link is either determined to exist 
or not101.
</p>
<p>c.  Not a causation issue
</p>
<p>If causation is understood in the second sense, then the problem must be ap-
proached from a different perspective102. The following possibilities are among 
the available options.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Prerequisites for liability &ndash; existence of negligence or a defect
On the one hand, it would be possible that the issue be considered when assess-
ing whether the injuring party was negligent and whether there was defectiveness 
in the construction or administration of the public structure. In the sample case 
above, the question would be whether the injuring party was obliged to prevent 
such consequences as were brought about by the forces of nature ( infringements 
of rights and damage ) and / or to undertake precautions against such grave conse-
quences of the natural forces ( infringements of rights and damage ).

</p>
<p>(   2  )   Consequences of liability &ndash; determining the amount of 
compensation
</p>
<p>On the other hand, this issue could be considered when it comes to determining 
the amount of compensation due. The question in this respect would be whether 
the amount of compensation should be diminished owing to the role played by 
the forces of nature.
</p>
<p>2.  Other injuring acts as competing causes
</p>
<p>Another case is when, besides the injuring party&rsquo;s tort, there were other tortious acts 
that come into question as the cause of the result ( infringement of a right or dam-
age ). An example of this would be when both factory Y1 and factory Y2 release sew-
age into a river and the fish farm downriver that belongs to X is destroyed as a result.
</p>
<p>In this respect, a further distinction must be drawn between the following two 
cases103.
</p>
<p>a.  Cumulative causation
</p>
<p>Firstly, several causes may compete with each other but all also have had the po-
tential to bring about the result on their own. In the above case this would be true 
if both the sewage from Y1 and the sewage from Y2 would have been sufficient to 
kill X&rsquo;s fish.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Conditio sine qua non
If causation is understood in the sense of the conditio sine qua non formula, the 
consequences are as follows104.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Conditio&emsp;sine&emsp;qua&emsp;non
</p>
<p>If the formula of the conditio sine qua non is applied directly, then the fish would 
also have died had Y1 not released its sewage into the river; therefore there is no 
causal link.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Exceptions
</p>
<p>However, it would be unfair if someone who actually ought to be liable alone is 
released from liability simply because, as chance would have it, another injuring 
act also took place. Therefore, it is accepted that this case is to be considered an 
</p>
<p>103 As in both cases cited below there is a causal link, the question of the extent of compensation 
also arises.

</p>
<p>exception from the application of the conditio sine qua non formula and liability 
must be recognised.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Causation in the sense of a regularity
If causation is understood in the sense of a regularity, however, causation must be 
recognised if, subject to the application of the regularity that fish die when sewage 
reaches a certain level in the water, it is then possible to say that both the sewage 
from Y1 and the sewage from Y2 were the causes of the fish dying105.
</p>
<p>b.  Necessary interaction of several causes
</p>
<p>Secondly, it may further be the case that several causes interact to produce the re-
sult, and that none of them by themselves would be sufficient to bring it about on 
their own. An example would be if neither the sewage from Y1 nor the sewage from 
Y2 respectively would be enough on their own to produce a fish kill and thus, the 
fish only died because the two spills interacted.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Conditio sine qua non
If causation is understood in the sense of a conditio sine qua non, then there is cau-
sation in this case as the fish would not have died if the sewage from Y2 had not 
been released into the river106.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Causation in the sense of a regularity
If causation is understood in the sense of a regularity, then causation would also 
be recognised if, under application of the regularity that fish die when the sewage 
reaches a certain level, both the sewage from Y1 and from Y2 can be seen as the 
cause of the fish kill.
</p>
<p>D.  Proof of causation
</p>
<p>1.  Standard of proof
</p>
<p>With respect to the proof of causation, the question as to standard of proof arises, 
ie what degree of proof is necessary in order to persuade the judge when consider-
ing the evidence, the following view is generally presented107.

</p>
<p>a.  High probability
</p>
<p>High probability that a certain fact brought about a certain result must be proven 
to establish causation.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   No necessity for actual scientific proof
According to this view, it is not required that actual scientific proof be produced to 
the effect that absolutely no doubt is allowed.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Simple probability is not sufficient
Simple probability, however, is not enough. It is considered that, if the court was 
to form its opinion on the basis of simple probability, this would endanger the 
public&rsquo;s trust in the fact-finding of the court.
</p>
<p>b.  Yardstick for evaluating probability
</p>
<p>There is high probability if an average person can be persuaded of the truth of the 
case without doubt. Requiring that everybody has to be convinced without any 
doubt whatsoever would ask the impossible of the court and the parties.
</p>
<p>2.  Burden of proof
</p>
<p>Further, there is the question of which party has the burden of proof as regards 
causation, ie whose risk it is if the causation is not provable ( non liquet ).
</p>
<p>a.  Basic rule
</p>
<p>In principle, the victim bears the burden of proof as regards causation, for the fol-
lowing reasons:
</p>
<p>The principle that the owner of the right must bear the infringements to his 
rights himself applies in principle. The law of delicts makes it possible, however, 
to shift this damage to the injuring party. The necessary prerequisites in this re-
spect must therefore be proven by the owner of the right, ie the victim.
</p>
<p>b.  Exception
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the victim is aided in the case of evidentiary difficulties by the fol-
lowing means.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Reversal of the burden of proof
Firstly, the duty to prove that there is no causal link may be shifted to the injuring 
party. This is the case in the following situations:

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Liability&emsp;for&emsp;auxiliaries
In the case of liability for auxiliaries, the principal is liable when the auxiliary 
has inflicted damage upon a third party in carrying out the work for the principal.  
The principal can only free himself from liability by proving that the damage 
would also have occurred if he had applied appropriate care in selecting and su-
pervising his auxiliary, ie if he proves that there is no causal link ( art 715 para 1 
sent 2 C C ).
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Alternative&emsp;causation
</p>
<p>If the result has been brought about by one of a number of events but it is not pos-
sible to determine which of them, then all obligors are liable jointly and severally 
( art 719 para 1 sent 2 C C )108. A perpetrator can only free himself from liability by 
proving that there is no causal link between his act and the result.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Prima facie proof
Secondly, without changing the allocation of the burden of proof, the evidentiary 
task may be made easier by allowing prima facie proof. This is applied commonly 
above all in cases of environmental damage or injury due to medication or food.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Concept
</p>
<p>Prima facie proof means that, if there is a rule of experience according to which 
the material fact can be assumed if a certain other fact ( indirect fact ) is estab-
lished, then the material fact will be presumed insofar as the party with the bur-
den of proof can establish the indirect fact.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Burden	of	proof
</p>
<p>In this case the burden of proof remains with the victim, who must prove the ma-
terial fact. If the causal link cannot be substantiated, this means that there is no 
causation.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Practical	significance	of	prima	facie	evidence
</p>
<p>If the victim proves the indirect fact, the injuring party must render the causa-
tion of the material fact improvable by proving special circumstances that mean 
the rule of experience does not apply. Unlike the reversal of the burden of proof, 
</p>
<p>108 Art 719 para 1 CC states: &raquo; If more than one person has inflicted damage on others by their joint 
tortious acts, each of them shall be jointly and severally liable to compensate for this damage. 
The same shall apply if it cannot be ascertained which of the joint tortfeasors inflicted the 
damage &laquo;. Although sent 2 refers to &raquo; joint tortfeasors &laquo;, there does not need to be any particu-

<p>however, the injuring party does not bear the burden of proving that there is no 
causal link.

</p>
<p>In the following cases prima facie proof has been allowed:
</p>
<p>aa.	 	When	the	pollution	&raquo;	reaches	up	to	the	gates	&laquo;
</p>
<p>If, in cases of environmental damage, the cause of the illness or the causal sub-
stance ( A ) and the means of pollution ( B ) are proven and if the source of the pollu-
tion reaches &raquo; to the doors of the enterprise &laquo;, then it is presumed that the toxins and 
emissions ( C ) derive from there, insofar as the entrepreneur cannot prove why his 
factory cannot be the source of the pollution109. This relates to prima facie evidence 
based on the rule of experience that if there is A and B, in general C can be assumed.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Epidemiological	causation
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is possible to observe the reason for a group of people being ill 
and to explain it and on this basis to establish the individual causation for each 
individual and their illness. This is known as epidemiological causation110.
</p>
<p>(   3  )   Prerequisites
In general there are four prerequisites for recognising epidemiological causation. 
Firstly, that the factor operates for a certain time before the illness breaks out; 
secondly, that the stronger this factor is, the higher the rate of people falling ill; 
thirdly, that the special features of the progress of the illness can be explained 
without any contradiction on the basis of the spread of the factor; and fourthly, 
that the mechanisms of how this factor operates can be explained as the cause 
without any biological contradictions.
</p>
<p>(   4  )   Significance
Epidemiological causation is actually causation in respect of a whole group. It is 
not ensured separately that this applies to causation in respect of the individual 
victims within this group. However, epidemiological causation is understood as a 
kind of rule of experience, according to which, when the victim belongs to a certain

<p>group ( A ), in general it is possible to assume the causal link ( B )111. Thus, if the 
victim proves A, then it is up to the injuring party to show that epidemiological 
causation does not apply in respect of this particular victim by proving special cir-
cumstances, in order to establish the non-provability ( non liquet ) of the causal 
link. This is the practical significance of epidemiological causation.

<p>Part 6 The elements of imputation
</p>
<p>I.  Necessity to justify imputation
</p>
<p>A.  Balance between the rights of the parties
</p>
<p>Within the law of delicts, one issue is how to balance the victim&rsquo;s need for protec-
tion of his rights with the injuring party&rsquo;s interest in not having his rights exces-
sively curtailed.
</p>
<p>1.  Indemnification of damage &ndash; protection of the victim&rsquo;s rights
</p>
<p>If someone interferes in the right of another, then granting compensation for the 
resulting damage represents the minimum of necessary protection for the right. 
Vice versa, however, any compensation that exceeds indemnification of the dam-
age sustained can no longer be justified by the principle of protecting rights.
</p>
<p>2.  Restriction of the injuring party&rsquo;s rights by protecting the victim &ndash; 
observance of the injuring party&rsquo;s rights
</p>
<p>Moreover, the rights of the injuring party may not be excessively restricted by the 
protection of the victim. Therefore, the question that arises is how far protecting 
the rights of the victim may justify restricting the injuring party&rsquo;s rights.
</p>
<p>B.  Principles of imputation
</p>
<p>The three following basic concepts can justify restricting the rights of the injur-
ing party; thus, they represent principles of imputation that support making the 
injuring party liable.
</p>
<p>1.  Causation
</p>
<p>Firstly, the causation of the infringement of the right or damage forms a basis for 
the imputation. Whoever has delivered the cause of the relevant result may be 
held liable for the damage.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>2.  Fault
</p>
<p>Secondly, fault may serve as a basis for imputation, in a twofold manner.
</p>
<p>a.  Basis for liability &ndash; blameworthiness of the acting party
</p>
<p>Firstly, someone who has injured the rights of another by himself being negligent 
is obliged to compensate. This is based on the idea that the party who has not 
acted as he ought to have must necessarily be subject to liability. Thus, the basis 
for the imputation is blameworthiness of the acting party.
</p>
<p>b.  Grounds for exoneration from liability &ndash; protection of freedom of 
action for the acting party
</p>
<p>On the other hand, despite infringement of a right, there will be no liability if the 
injuring party did not act negligently. This is based on the idea that there should 
not be liability if someone has acted as he ought to have. This protects the acting 
party&rsquo;s freedom of action.
</p>
<p>3.  No-fault based liability &ndash; strict liability
</p>
<p>Thirdly, an accident caused by a source of danger considered by society to be nec-
essary may still result in the liability of the party who possesses the source of dan-
ger completely independently of whether there was fault on his part.
</p>
<p>a.  Necessity for no-fault based liability
</p>
<p>No-fault based liability can be justified by the following considerations: if activi-
ties or things are absolutely necessary for society, then the exercise of such activ-
ity or possession of such thing cannot be forbidden, even though it is dangerous. 
Further, it is frequently impossible to prevent an accident occurring as a result of 
such a dangerous activity or thing even if the keeper of the source of danger exer-
cises care. If the principle of fault was applied in this context, there would be no 
protection whatsoever for the rights of the victim.
</p>
<p>b.  Imputation principles of no-fault based liability
</p>
<p>In general, the following two principles are cited as the basis for no-fault based 
liability.

</p>
<p>(   1  )   Liability based on who controls the source of danger
Firstly, the damage may be imputed based on who has control of the source of 
danger. This means that the party who is entitled to control the dangerous activity 
or thing is liable for the damage resulting from the manifestation of the danger.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Liability based on who profits from the source of danger
Secondly, the damage may be imputed on the basis of who derives profit from 
having the source of danger. This means that the party who is entitled to control 
a dangerous activity or thing and who derives a profit therefrom, is liable for the 
damage caused by the source of danger.
</p>
<p>II.  Infringement of a right and wrongfulness
</p>
<p>A.  Prerequisites
</p>
<p>Article 709 CC sets out the general prerequisites for tort, namely that someone 
who &raquo; has intentionally or negligently infringed the right or legally protected in-
terest of another shall be liable to compensate any damage resulting in conse-
quence &laquo;. As already described in detail above ( Chapter 3 II ), there was intense 
debate on the prerequisites consisting in the infringement of a right as well as of 
intention and negligence. If the last described view above is taken as a premise, ie 
that the primary material issue is the rights ( rights thesis ), then the prerequisites 
for liability are as follows.
</p>
<p>1.  Infringement of a right &ndash; protection of the victim&rsquo;s rights
</p>
<p>If the rights of the victim have been infringed, then at least the resulting damage 
must be compensated in order to protect such. In this sense, the prerequisite of 
the infringement of a right is understood as a prerequisite to protect the victim&rsquo;s 
rights.
</p>
<p>2.  Intention or negligence &ndash; limitation of the injuring party&rsquo;s rights
</p>
<p>If the injuring party, however, was also held liable even when he did not act either 
intentionally or negligently, this would be an excessive limitation of his rights. 
The prerequisite of intention or negligence thus fulfils a function with respect to 
the limitation of the injuring party&rsquo;s rights, specifically by justifying such limita-
tion.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>B.  Difference forms encountered
</p>
<p>However, the relationship between infringement of a right and intention or neg-
ligence is subject to various different interpretations, depending on what type of 
right has been infringed in what manner112.
</p>
<p>1.  Types of rights
</p>
<p>The following two types of rights are distinguished
</p>
<p>a.  Rights to control something ( Herrschaftsrechte )
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Significance
The first type of rights is those that are recognised generally as rights to control 
something ( Herrschaftsrechte ). This type is distinguished by being clearly de-
fined, namely as the control over a legal good.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Rights&emsp;to&emsp;control&emsp;pecuniary&emsp;assets
</p>
<p>Examples of this type include the in rem rights, in particular property, but also 
easements or security interests, and other corresponding pecuniary rights such 
as absolutely protected tenant rights to immovables.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Rights&emsp;to&emsp;control&emsp;related&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;person&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;&raquo;&emsp;physical&emsp;
personality&emsp;rights&emsp;&laquo;
</p>
<p>These rights to control are equated with the rights to life and bodily integrity, 
which are referred to as &raquo; physical personality rights &laquo;.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Prerequisites &ndash; infringement of a right and intention or 
negligence
</p>
<p>As this type of right is clearly defined, it is relatively easy to determine whether the 
right has been infringed; the presence of intention or negligence must be exam-
ined separately.

</p>
<p>b.  &raquo; Correlative rights &laquo;
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Significance
The second type of rights is those in respect of which there must first be a weigh-
ing up of interests before the extent of the protection can be determined: the pro-
tective scope of a correlative right depends on which other rights are juxtaposed 
and would in turn be limited by the protection of the correlative right. Therefore, 
the relationship between the hierarchy of the rights and the gravity of the threat-
ened impairment of the correlative right, on the one hand, and the gravity of the 
restriction of the juxtaposed rights that would be imposed to protect the correla-
tive right, on the other, must be examined.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Correlative&emsp;pecuniary&emsp;rights
aa.	 	Relative	pecuniary	rights
</p>
<p>Within the pecuniary rights, rights that exist in relation to another person, such 
as contractual positions, rights to claim something or acquisition rights are cat-
egorised as relative rights.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Joint	pecuniary	rights
</p>
<p>Furthermore, correlative pecuniary rights also include rights to public goods 
( common goods ), such as information, mineral resources or the environment. Ex-
amples of these are intellectual property rights relating to information of which 
it is per se not possible to have segregated possession as in relation to material 
goods, and that artificially delineates these; mining rights, fish farming rights, 
rights to use water, rights to thermal springs and rights to sunlight, fresh air, ad-
equate ventilation, peace and quiet, views and to enjoy nature.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Correlative&emsp;personality&emsp;rights
aa.	 	Intangible	personality	rights
</p>
<p>Personality rights also include rights that concern the psychological-emotional 
state of the individual, such as freedom of belief and religion, the protective scope 
of which is determined in relation to other people&rsquo;s freedom to act, thus render-
ing them correlative rights.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Relative	personality	rights
</p>
<p>Furthermore, rights that concern how relationships to others are constituted 
must be equated with these, in particular when it comes to how family relation-
ships are constituted.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>cc.	 	Social	personality	rights
</p>
<p>Rights that concern one&rsquo;s own life image &ndash; for instance, how one presents oneself 
or what one wishes to disclose about oneself &ndash; in relation to society, for example 
name, picture, reputation, reliability and private life ( eg rights to control informa-
tion in this respect ) are also correlative rights.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Prerequisites &ndash; equation of infringement of a right with 
wrongfulness
</p>
<p>In relation to rights of this type, it is often unclear how far these extend as the 
rights of the victim. Hence, the evaluation of whether a right was infringed is also 
an evaluation of what another party ( the injuring party ) is entitled to do as well 
as whether there is fault. In this case, infringement of a right and fault are fre-
quently not examined separately; instead the issue is just generally whether there 
was wrongfulness.
</p>
<p>An example is offered by the following case: X hurt an American soldier in 
Okinawa when this city was still occupied by the USA after World War II and was 
consequently sentenced to three years in a penitentiary for bodily harm. After fin-
ishing his term of imprisonment, X moved to Tokyo, where he lived peacefully. 
However, he concealed his criminal record. Ten years later Y, who was involved in 
the proceeding against X as a jury member, published a novel based on true facts 
in which he named X without X&rsquo;s permission by his full name, meaning that X&rsquo;s 
criminal record became general knowledge in his surroundings113.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Victim&rsquo;s&emsp;rights&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;private&emsp;sphere
</p>
<p>In this case, one issue is whether the victim X has a right not to have his criminal 
record made public. This overlaps with the question of which rights are in play re-
garding the person that made it public.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Injuring&emsp;party&rsquo;s&emsp;rights&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;freedom&emsp;of&emsp;expression
</p>
<p>After all we must also ask whether the injuring party Y is entitled to publish a 
fact-based novel dealing with the criminal record of another or, put differently, 
whether Y&rsquo;s right to freedom of opinion is not excessively restricted if a duty to 
compensate is imposed.
</p>
<p>2.  Types of interference
</p>
<p>Moreover, two types of interference are also distinguished.
</p>
<p>113 This case is based on the decision of the Supreme Court of 8. 2. 1994, Minsh&ucirc; 48&ndash;2, 149.

</p>
<p>a.  Physical inteference
</p>
<p>The first category includes physical injuries. In the case of such, the exercise of a 
right is impaired without the consent of the owner of such right.
</p>
<p>b.  Interference with decisions &ndash; coincidence of several aspects
</p>
<p>The second category is formed by cases in which damage is sustained due to influ-
ence on the will of the victim &ndash; for example, due to incorrect information. Typical 
examples of this are when the victim is induced by misinformation to enter into a 
disadvantageous contract, or when he consents to a medical procedure he did not 
actually desire without being adequately informed in advance. Two aspects are at 
play when it comes to this type of injury.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Infringement of a right to control
One aspect is that the person or the pecuniary assets of the victim are injured as a 
result, ie one of the above cited rights to control. In this case it is relatively easy to 
determine whether such a right has been infringed. Aside from this, the presence 
of intention or negligence can be examined.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Infringement of a correlative right
The other aspect is that the victim&rsquo;s right to self-determination, which is a correla-
tive right, has been infringed. In this case, the question of whether there was in-
fringement of a right is examined at the same time as the issue of how the injuring 
party ought to have acted and whether there was fault.
</p>
<p>C.  Infringement of relative pecuniary rights &ndash; interference with 
contractual relations
</p>
<p>In order to look at the above-described in more detail, this and the following sec-
tion will examine some typical groups of cases. This section is dedicated to inter-
ference with contractual relations as a type of case belonging to the above-cited 
infringement of relative rights.
</p>
<p>1.  Problem issue
</p>
<p>A claim is a right which exists in respect of the obligor. If delictual liability is rec-
ognised regarding the interference with such a right, the following issues arise.

<p>595Part 6&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;elements&emsp;of&emsp;imputation
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>a.  Intervening position of the obligor
</p>
<p>Firstly, the realisation of the claim depends on whether the obligor fulfils the 
claim. Unlike when it comes to in rem rights or one of the &raquo; physical personality 
rights &laquo;, the question of whether the right is infringed may thus also depend on an 
action of the obligor. Therefore, the question is how the freedom of the obligor 
should be taken into account.
</p>
<p>b.  Recognisability
</p>
<p>Secondly, insofar as there has been no public notification, the existence of the 
claim or the underlying contract is not recognisable without any effort to unin-
volved third parties. If delictual liability is nonetheless recognised on the basis of 
infringement of a right, there is a risk that the injuring party become subject to an 
obligation that was not foreseeable to him.
</p>
<p>2.  Traditional view &ndash; assessment of the degree of wrongfulness
</p>
<p>Traditionally, the problem of interference with contractual relations was handled 
within the framework of wrongfulness when assessing the degree of wrongful-
ness114.
</p>
<p>a.  Assessment of wrongfulness
</p>
<p>This view proceeds on the basis that the question of whether there is wrongfulness 
is examined by comprehensive analysis of the degree of wrongfulness in relation 
to the injured interests and the degree of wrongfulness in relation to the nature 
and type of the injuring act and consideration of the interrelationship of the two115.
</p>
<p>b.  Interference with contractual relations
</p>
<p>As a claim is a right brokered by the will of the obligor, it is weaker than the in rem 
rights. For interference with contractual relations to be seen as wrongful, there-
fore, the degree of wrongfulness of the injuring act must be particularly high. The 
following types of interference with contractual relations can be distinguished 
under this aspect116.

<p>(   1  )   Infringement upon the ownership of a claim
One type of impairment of a claim is the infringement upon the ownership of a 
claim.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Degree&emsp;of&emsp;infringement&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;interest
</p>
<p>As in this case the obligee loses his claim, this is an extremely direct form of in-
fringement. If the obligor, for example, pays to a quasi-possessor of the claim, then 
this is an effective discharge of such, provided that the obligor has acted in good 
faith and not negligently ( art 478 CC ). This discharge of the claim then means that 
the claim is taken from the obligee.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Nature&emsp;and&emsp;type&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;injuring&emsp;action
</p>
<p>As here there is no difference to an infringement of property rights, liability will 
be established in the case of intention or negligence as in a usual case of tort.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Interference in the performance
The other possibility for how a claim can be impaired consists in interference 
with performance, so that the fulfilment of the claim is impeded. Once again, two 
forms can be distinguished in this respect.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Extinguishment&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;claim
</p>
<p>The first case is when the performance is impeded, eg by destruction of the deliv-
erable or by injuring the obligor, and as a result the claim is extinguished.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Degree	of	infringement	of	the	interest
</p>
<p>As in this case the obligee&rsquo;s claim ultimately is extinguished, the same applies as 
when the infringement is upon the ownership of the claim.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Nature	and	type	of	the	injuring	action
</p>
<p>There is controversy as to how the interfering action by the injuring party must be 
constituted for there to be wrongfulness. The earlier prevailing opinion was that, 
as in the case of a usual tort, the existence of intention or negligence would be 
sufficient, since there was no difference in this respect to damage to property117.
</p>
<p>Nowadays, however, one influential viewpoint is that the injuring party must 
recognise and accept the infringement of the claim118 for, if negligence alone was 
sufficient, this view holds, there would be a risk that the injuring party&rsquo;s liability 
be boundless.

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Continued&emsp;existence&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;claim
The second case is when the obligee cannot obtain the performance as the injur-
ing party has concluded a similar contract with the obligor.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Degree	of	the	infringement	of	the	interest
</p>
<p>In this case the wrongfulness of the interference with the obligee&rsquo;s claim is seen 
as relatively low for the following reasons.
</p>
<p>aaa.  Continued existence of the claim
</p>
<p>Even though the obligee in this case cannot obtain the actual performance, he still 
has the right to claim compensation. If the injuring party concludes the same con-
tract with the obligor and there is a conclusive acquisition of a right because the 
injuring party or a third party who has acquired the thing or right from the injur-
ing party fulfils the prerequisites for third party effect of acquisition of property119, 
the obligor&rsquo;s original duty to perform is extinguished with respect to the obligee 
due to impossibility. If the impossibility is attributable to the obligor, however, 
then the obligee has a compensation claim against the obligor.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Approach taken in the Civil Code
</p>
<p>In the case of a double sale, the rule in art 177 CC, according to which the loss or 
the change of an in rem right can only be asserted against third parties when there 
has been a registration, means it is possible to assume as follows.
</p>
<p>aaaa. Principle of free competition
</p>
<p>In a society that is based on free competition, it is admissible to compete in re-
spect of a legal acquisition against another party who has already acquired an in 
rem right ( but not fulfilled the criteria for third party effect ), by offering the for-
mer owner of the right more advantageous conditions.
</p>
<p>bbbb.  Self-responsibility of the owner of the right
</p>
<p>If the person who acquired the in rem right first failed to have this entered in the 
register immediately, thus securing his own legal position, then it is inevitable in 
a society based on free competition that he lose this right.
</p>
<p>119 According to Japanese law, the right in the relationship between the parties is already trans-
ferred with the conclusion of the contract establishing the obligation ( art 176 CC ). For the ac-
quirer to be able to assert the acquisition against third parties it is necessary that in the case of 
movables there be delivery ( art 178 CC ), in the case of immovables there has been registration 
in the real estate register ( art 177 CC ) and in the case of claims there has been notice or entry 
in a register.

</p>
<p>bb.	 	Nature	and	type	of	the	injuring	action
</p>
<p>If the injuring party concludes a contract that competes with the one the obligee 
concluded, then as a rule this does not yet constitute wrongfulness. Consequently, 
the wrongfulness in relation to the nature and type of the injuring action must be 
particularly strong.
</p>
<p>aaa.  Objective aspect
</p>
<p>To this end, it is necessary, on the one hand, that the injuring party&rsquo;s action be so 
blameworthy that it cannot be condoned even in a society where there is free com-
petition. This is the case, for example, when unfair actions such as fraud or threat 
take place or a party unjustifiedly only follows his own interests without any con-
sideration of the interests of others.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Subjective aspect
On the other hand, the injuring party must act intentionally in the context of the in-
terference. In this respect it is not only necessary that the injuring party knows that 
the claim exists and that he infringes it but also that he incite the obligor or work 
in collusion with such120. It is necessary that the obligee&rsquo;s reliance on the obligor 
fulfilling the claim is disappointed by the active involvement of the injuring party.
</p>
<p>c.  Criticisms
</p>
<p>The following criticisms are levelled at the above-described traditional view on 
interference with contractual relations, which is based on the determination of 
wrongfulness by assessing the degree of wrongfulness in relation to the interests 
infringed as well as the nature and type of the injuring act in the context of their 
relationship to one another121.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Categorisation
The above-described categorisation gives rise to the following problems.

ownership&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;claim
</p>
<p>On the one hand, it does not make much sense to list interference in ownership 
of the claim as a separate category as it is undisputed that such interference is an 
ordinary tort.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Problems&emsp;with&emsp;respect&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;category&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;interference&emsp;
with&emsp;the&emsp;performance
</p>
<p>If one thinks of the different problems that arise in practice, on the other hand, 
this shows that the category of interference in the performance covers very di-
verse cases. These manifold problems cannot be resolved adequately within the 
categories set out &ndash; interference in the ownership of the claim or interference 
with the performance, continued existence of the claim or extinguishment of the 
claim.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Shortcomings of the legal instruments
The traditional view on interference with contractual relations further requires 
that, in the case of the category of continued existence of the claim, when there is 
interference with the performance, there must be particularly serious wrongful-
ness of the action, in which context intention alone is not enough but instead it is 
necessary that there have been inducement or collusion. Nonetheless, the ques-
tion of why the delictual liability should be so limited if the obligee cannot obtain 
the performance owed to him on the basis of a contract due to an action by the 
injuring party does arise. This would ultimately mean that it is actually admissible 
to disregard the contract of another party122.
</p>
<p>3.  Theory of breach of contract
</p>
<p>In more recent times, however, there has been increasing popularity for the view 
that looks at the infringement of the claim from the perspective of respect for the 
contract ( favor contractus )  123.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>a.  Aspects of the new approach
</p>
<p>According to this view, the following two forms must be distinguished124.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Factual conduct &ndash; breach of contract by factual conduct
The first category are cases in which the rights deriving from the contract are in-
fringed by a factual breach, for example by destruction or removal of the thing 
which is the object of the contract or by locking in the obligor
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Legal agreement &ndash; breach of contract by contract
The second category includes cases in which the rights deriving from the contract 
are infringed by a legal agreement, for example when a second contract that com-
petes with the original contract is concluded. In this respect, the relativity of the 
contract is the core issue.
</p>
<p>b.  Reason for categorisation
</p>
<p>The distinction between these two categories is necessary because the rights of 
the injuring party, which are restricted, are different in the two cases.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Factual conduct &ndash; general freedom of action
If in the case of interference through factual conduct this conduct is seen as a tort, 
this means that this conduct is not allowed in the first place. Insofar therefore, the 
injuring party&rsquo;s general freedom to act is restricted.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Legal agreement &ndash; freedom of contract
In the case of interference by legal agreement, however, classifying the contract 
as a tort would mean it was inadmissible to conclude this contract. To this extent, 
thus, the injuring party&rsquo;s freedom to contract is restricted. This conflict with the 
principle of freedom of contract and, moreover, the principle of free competition 
constitutes a serious problem.
</p>
<p>c.  Factual conduct &ndash; interference in the contract by factual conduct
</p>
<p>In the case of interference by factual conduct, the question that arises is how far 
the protection of the contractual right to claim justifies a limitation of the injur-
ing party&rsquo;s freedom to act.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Intentional interference
If the injuring party knew of the claim&rsquo;s existence and engaged in the conduct 
that interferes with it anyway, there is no problem with assuming a tort as this is a 
grave breach of the prohibition on harming other people ( harm principle ). There 
is no freedom to infringe other people&rsquo;s rights intentionally.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Inducement,&emsp;collusion
</p>
<p>It is certainly an intentional infringement to influence the obligor so that he does 
not fulfil the claim.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Destruction&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;object&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;contract,&emsp;locking&emsp;in&emsp;the&emsp;
obligor
</p>
<p>Destroying or removing the object of the contract or locking in the obligor consti-
tutes a tort if the injuring party knew that the obligee had a claim deriving from 
the contract and knowingly accepted the fact that this would not be fulfilled.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Non-intentional interference &ndash; indirect damage or damage 
sustained by an entrepreneur
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is problematic when the injuring party had no such inten-
tion. This is the case, for instance, when an employee suffers a bodily injury due 
to a traffic accident and consequently his employer, an entrepreneur, suffers loss. 
However, this is closely connected with the question of limiting imputation and 
will thus be discussed in Chapter 7.
</p>
<p>d.  Legal agreement &ndash; breach of contract by contract
</p>
<p>When it comes to breaches of contract by legal agreement, the following two cat-
egories must be distinguished depending on the type of the competing contract.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Double sale &ndash; inadmissible deprivation of assets by contract
The first category covers cases in which two competing contracts both concern 
the same asset as their object. The problem here is that the obligee has already 
concluded a contract regarding the acquisition of a certain asset with the obligor 
and nonetheless this asset is transferred to a third party due to a second contract 
being concluded with the same obligor, so that the obligee in the first contract ul-
timately cannot acquire the asset.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Infringement&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;victim&rsquo;s&emsp;rights
</p>
<p>The first question that arises is whether one can say that the obligee&rsquo;s rights out of 
the first contract are infringed by the conclusion of the second contract.

</p>
<p>aa.	 	Understanding	of	free	competition
</p>
<p>The CC is based on the concept of free competition but the free competition  
allowed by the CC with respect to the conditions of a contract conclusion only  
relate to the time until the conclusion of the contract and are no longer applicable 
when another party has already concluded a contract.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Respect	for	the	contract
</p>
<p>If a contract has already been concluded, then this must indeed also be respected 
by third parties. If a second contract is nonetheless concluded, this must be seen 
as infringing the obligee&rsquo;s rights from the earlier contract.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Limitation&emsp;of&emsp;rights&emsp;as&emsp;regards&emsp;the&emsp;injuring&emsp;party
</p>
<p>However, the question also arises as to how far it is justifiable to restrict third par-
ties&rsquo; freedom to contract in order to protect the obligee&rsquo;s rights out of the earlier 
contract. Material in this respect is the nature and type of the damaging act by the 
third party, in particular the subjective aspects.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Requirement	of	intention
</p>
<p>It is argued that a tort must be recognised when the third party knew of the earlier 
contract and nonetheless deliberately accepted infringing it125. This is based on 
the following considerations.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Intentional	double	contract
</p>
<p>Even a restriction according to which concluding a competing contract in knowl-
edge of the earlier contract is not allowed does not lead to any unreasonable re-
striction of the third party&rsquo;s freedom to contract.
</p>
<p>aaa.  Non-intentional double contract
</p>
<p>However, if it was not admissible to conclude a second contract even though the 
party concluding the contract had no knowledge of the earlier contract, this would 
lead to an unreasonable restriction of the freedom to contract. After all, there is 
no duty on the part of the party concluding the contract to research this. This is 
based on the concept of as-far-as-possible respect for freedom of contract.
</p>

674 f. According to Isomura, K&ocirc;be H&ocirc;gaku Zasshi 35&ndash;2, 392 f, however, any such action with just 
simple knowledge of the infringement of the claim is basically outside the scope of freedom of 
contract ( bad faith ).

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>bbb.  Intention or negligence
</p>
<p>In this respect, however, it is also argued that there is a tort if the third party has 
acted intentionally ( or in bad faith ) or even negligently with respect to the breach 
of the earlier contract126. This is based on the idea that it is not an unreasonable 
limitation on the third party&rsquo;s freedom to contract if a limitation is imposed to the 
effect that he is not allowed to conclude a contract if the breach of rights of the 
parties to the earlier contract is recognisable. This is based on a far-as-possible re-
alisation of the principle of respect for a contract.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Solicitation of workers &ndash; unfair frustration of work 
performance by contract
</p>
<p>The second category covers cases in which several service contracts, for instance 
employment contracts or work contracts, compete with one another. The problem 
here is that the party owing a service may be wooed away by another contract so 
that the obligee under the first contract does not receive the service.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Basic&emsp;case&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;simple&emsp;solicitation
</p>
<p>aa.	  Infringement of rights of the victim
</p>
<p>With respect to the victim&rsquo;s infringed rights, the following are the special features 
relevant in this context.
</p>
<p>aaa.  Victim&rsquo;s rights
</p>
<p>The obligee under the earlier contract has a contractual right to receive the service 
from the employee, ie a claim to the employee&rsquo;s work performance.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Freedom to terminate the employment relationship and its 
imputation
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the employee has the freedom to choose his profession and is also 
free in general to terminate the employment relationship ( art 627 CC ). Therefore, 
the claim to work performance by the employee is not an absolute entitlement or 
one that is secured so that whatever happens the employer can seek the work per-
formance.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Limitation	of	the	rights	on	the	side	of	the	injuring	party
</p>
<p>The issue is how far the protection of the obligee&rsquo;s rights under the earlier con-
tract justify restricting third parties&rsquo; freedom to contract.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>aaa.  Basic rule &ndash; freedom to contract prevails
</p>
<p>In this case, the freedom to contract prevails in principle, so that no tort can be 
recognised127. This is based on the following considerations.
</p>
<p>aaaa. Freedom to solicit employees, etc
</p>
<p>If a third party offers better conditions and woos away the employee ( obligor ), the 
obligee must put up with this.
</p>
<p>bbbb.  Freedom to change job
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the employee ( obligor ) is free to choose his occupation so that he 
cannot be prevented from deciding to end his employment relationship and take 
another job.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Exception &ndash; prohibition on inappropriate conduct
</p>
<p>Since, however, the obligee from the earlier contract also has a claim, the prohibi-
tion on infringing the rights of others is applicable. If this prohibition on injur-
ing others is breached in a grave fashion, for instance in that the employee is not 
merely encouraged to change job but also solicited away in a socially inappropri-
ate manner, this does constitute a tort128.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Coincidence&emsp;with&emsp;a&emsp;special&emsp;right
</p>
<p>If the victim, however, has another special right worthy of protection, this justifies 
limiting the employee&rsquo;s freedom to end the employment relationship, as well as 
the freedom of competition for third parties. The following are two conceivable 
examples of such special rights.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Infringement	of	a	business	secret	or	of	know-how
</p>
<p>Firstly, it is conceivable that the victim possesses a business secret or know-how 
worthy of protection.
</p>
<p>aaa.  Infringement of a right on the part of the victim
</p>
<p>Know-how and business secrets are intangible assets of the victim. If these are be-
trayed to the competition, this would be an infringement of these goods. For this 
reason the employee is subject to a duty of non-disclosure even after leaving the 
employee as well as a duty not to work for a rival enterprise for a certain period of 
time.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>bbb.  Restricting the rights of the injuring party
</p>
<p>In order to protect the victim&rsquo;s rights, the procedure will be the same as in the case 
of an ordinary tort in that liability is recognised if the injuring party acted inten-
tionally or negligently129.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Breach	of	an	exclusive	or	sole	contract
</p>
<p>Secondly, it is conceivable that the victim concluded an exclusive or sole contract 
with the victim.
</p>
<p>aaa.  Breach of the rights on the part of the victim &ndash; exclusive or 
sole contract
</p>
<p>The infringed rights of the victim display the following special features in this 
case.
</p>
<p>aaaa. Reinforcement of victim&rsquo;s rights
</p>
<p>In this case, the victim has an entitlement that the obligor not work for others.
</p>
<p>bbbb.  Restriction of the obligor&rsquo;s freedom
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the obligor&rsquo;s freedom to conclude a contract with another is limited 
by the exclusive or sole contract with the victim. Therefore, he himself gave up the 
freedom to terminate the employment contract without cause.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Restriction of the rights on the part of the injuring party
</p>
<p>In order to protect the victim, the procedure is the same as in the case of any other 
tort to recognise liability if the injuring party acted intentionally or negligently. 
For in the case of an exclusive or sole contract, third parties are not allowed to of-
fend against the contract either. In this case, respect for the contract is especially 
highlighted.
</p>
<p>D.  Infringement of public pecuniary rights &ndash; nuisance affecting 
neighbours and the environment
</p>
<p>1.  Problem issue
</p>
<p>A further concrete example for the relationship between infringement of a right 
and wrongfulness may be the infringement of public property rights, in particular 
the environment.
</p>
<p>129 According to art 4 of the Unfair Competition Act, anyone who intentionally or negligently in-
jures the business interests of another by unfair competition is liable to compensate the result-
ing damage.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>a.  Feature of the right
</p>
<p>As someone&rsquo;s &raquo; enjoyment of the environment &laquo; is inevitably influenced in many 
ways by the conduct of neighbours, it is essential to achieve a balance between the 
rights of neighbours.
</p>
<p>b.  Nature and type of the interference
</p>
<p>In this case, there are the following two forms in relation to the nature and type 
of the interference130.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Positive infringement &ndash; emissions
One form is the infringement of someone&rsquo;s &raquo; enjoyment of the environment &laquo; by 
emissions from outside, such as smoke or noise. In this case, there is a certain re-
semblance to a physical attack.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Negative infringement
The other form is an outside change, for example by blocking someone&rsquo;s view or 
sunlight or by destroying the landscape so that his &raquo; enjoyment of the environ-
ment &laquo; becomes impossible.
</p>
<p>c.  Object of the interference
</p>
<p>There are two options with respect to the object of the interference.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Infringement of assets or victim&rsquo;s body
On the one hand, it is possible to be injured in terms of assets or physically ( health ) 
due to deterioration of the environment.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Infringement of the actual enjoyment of the environment itself
On the other hand, enjoyment of the environment can in itself be injured. In this 
respect the question arises whether a right to enjoy the environment must be rec-
ognised in respect of each individual and, if so, how far this extends.
</p>
<p>2.  Positive infringement &ndash; damage to health and lifestyle by noise
</p>
<p>Such disturbances in how someone leads his life are becoming a serious problem 
with increasing urbanisation. Impairments by noise, smell or smoke are typical ex-
amples. Below, the basic considerations are represented using the example of noise.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>a.  Tolerance limit
</p>
<p>An approach has been developed according to which the wrongfulness of an im-
pairment in such cases must be assessed subject to whether the limit of what must 
be tolerated in everyday social life has been exceeded131.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Within the limits of tolerance
If the damage does not exceed the limit of what must be tolerated, then the rights 
of the victim have not been wrongfully infringed, thus the injuring party&rsquo;s act was 
lawful.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Beyond the limits of tolerance
If, on the other hand, the damage exceeds the limit of what must be tolerated, 
then this means that the victim&rsquo;s rights have been wrongfully infringed and thus, 
the injuring party&rsquo;s act was unlawful.
</p>
<p>b.  Yardstick to assess the limits of tolerance
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Necessity to protect the victim&rsquo;s rights
With respect to the limit of tolerance, the first question that arises is how neces-
sary it is to protect the victim&rsquo;s rights.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Legal&emsp;nature&emsp;and&emsp;scope&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;infringed&emsp;interests,&emsp;extent&emsp;of&emsp;
the&emsp;injury
</p>
<p>The necessity for protection depends ( 1 ) on the legal nature and scope of the in-
fringed interests and ( 2 ) on the extent of the impairment.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Bodily	integrity,	health
</p>
<p>If bodily integrity and health are injured, this generally justifies awarding damage.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Undisturbed	life
</p>
<p>If the damage does not exceed an impairment of the undisturbed lifestyle, then 
the question is whether there has been a serious infringement.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Regional&emsp;differences
</p>
<p>Moreover, ( 3 ) the extent to which the victim&rsquo;s rights are protected depends on 
where he lives and his surroundings.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Social	influences	on	the	right
</p>
<p>Firstly, we must ask what is recognised in the relevant region as a right ? The right 
to enjoy the environment can vary from city to countryside and depending on 
whether a residential, commercial or industrial setting is concerned.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Knowledge	and	recognition	of	changes
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it must be examined whether the victim set out a certain state of the 
region as a requirement when acquiring and holding the right. At least if he knew 
which region was involved, it is not possible to speak of any right to enjoy the en-
vironment exceeding this.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Appropriate exercise of right by injuring party
Secondly, in assessing the limits of tolerance there is the issue of how appropriate 
the injuring party&rsquo;s exercise of his right was. Only when it is established that this 
was appropriate, can tolerance be required from the victim.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Extent&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;infringement&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;prohibition&emsp;on&emsp;inflicting&emsp;
damage&emsp;upon&emsp;another
</p>
<p>Here too, the prohibition on damaging the rights of another applies. If this pro-
hibition has been violated to a serious degree, it is not possible to assume there 
was appropriate exercise of a right, meaning that the victim cannot be required to 
tolerate such.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Nature	and	type	of	infringing	act
</p>
<p>The extent of the infringement of the prohibition on inflicting damage upon oth-
ers depends ( 4 ) on the nature and type of the infringing act. In this respect, it is 
necessary to examine whether the injuring party knew of the infringement, will-
fully ran the risk of it or even intended it.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Start	and	continuation	of	the	infringing	act
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the extent of the violation of the prohibition on inflicting damage 
upon others also depends ( 5 ) on the start of the infringing act and its continua-
tion.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Measures&emsp;to&emsp;avoid&emsp;the&emsp;damage&emsp;as&emsp;well&emsp;as&emsp;their&emsp;scope&emsp;and&emsp;
effect
</p>
<p>Besides this, the extent of the violation against the prohibition on inflicting dam-
age upon others also depends on whether &ndash; if there was damaging conduct in the 
first place &ndash; ( 6 ) the injuring party took measures to prevent the damage and, if so, 
which these were and what effect they had.

<p>(&emsp;&emsp;iii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Compliance&emsp;with&emsp;administrative&emsp;law&emsp;provisions
Furthermore, the extent of the prohibition on inflicting damage upon others de-
pends on whether ( 7 ) administrative law provisions were observed. However, this 
only applies when the purpose of the relevant administrative law rule is to protect 
the victim&rsquo;s rights. Therefore, it cannot simply be assumed without further ado 
that there was a wrongful infringement of a right because a legal provision was in-
fringed132.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;iv&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Public&emsp;concerns&emsp;and&emsp;necessity&emsp;for&emsp;community&emsp;welfare
</p>
<p>Moreover, it is controversial when determining the limit of tolerance, how far it 
must be considered ( 8 ) in which manner and to what extent public concerns are 
affected by the infringing act and to what extent community welfare depends on 
these.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Affirmative	view
</p>
<p>According to the affirmative view, the damaging act is legitimate if the public in-
terest in it is high; thus, the victim must tolerate it.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Negative	view
</p>
<p>According to the opposite view, on the other hand, public interests or the require-
ments of community welfare do not provide sufficient grounds to compel the vic-
tim to tolerate the infringement of a right133. This view is based on the following 
considerations.
</p>
<p>aaa.  Basic rule
</p>
<p>If in such a case no compensation is granted, then the rights of the victim would 
be completely unprotected. The public interest cannot justify robbing the victim 
in this manner of his minimum protection134.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Exception &ndash; requirement of reciprocity
</p>
<p>However, if not only the public interest and the necessity for community welfare 
is great but also the victim too would gain a corresponding advantage, this may be 
regarded as an additional ground to require tolerance by the victim135.

</p>
<p>E.  Correlative personality rights &ndash; private sphere
</p>
<p>Lastly, the infringement of correlative personality rights, in particular the right 
to a private sphere, shall be discussed as an example here of the relationship be-
tween infringement of a right and wrongfulness.
</p>
<p>1.  Concept of the private sphere
</p>
<p>There is debate on how the concept of the private sphere should be understood.
</p>
<p>a.  Right to keep private life secret
</p>
<p>According to one view, there is a right, if so desired, to &raquo; be left alone &laquo;, as well as a 
right not to have one&rsquo;s private life made public without one&rsquo;s permission136.
</p>
<p>b.  Right to control information in this respect
</p>
<p>According to another view, the private sphere is the right to control information 
concerning one&rsquo;s own person oneself137. The focus here is not the preservation 
of private secrets but on active and autonomous decision-making on how much 
should be disclosed to whom.
</p>
<p>2.  Examination of infringement of private sphere
</p>
<p>a.  Prerequisite for the protection of the rights of the victim &ndash; 
infringement of the private sphere
</p>
<p>Firstly, it is necessary that the private sphere of the victim has been infringed.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Public matter
A public matter is a matter in which society has a legitimate interest; it is in princi-
ple excluded from the private sphere. For instance, matters connected with crimes 
or court judgements affect, inter alia, the security of the public, the legal protec-
tion of the citizens and the due and proper functioning of the organs of the state, 
and thus are generally not covered by the private sphere.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Criminal record
In this connection, the question is whether there is a right not to have a criminal 
record made public without consent. The following considerations are relevant.

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Progression&emsp;of&emsp;time
If after a certain time has expired something has been forgotten by the average 
person, then there is no longer a justified public interest in knowing and the crim-
inal record becomes part of the private sphere. However, as there are also events, 
for instance historical crimes, that remain in the public eye even after some time, 
the passing of time alone can hardly be seen as decisive.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Resocialising&emsp;criminals
</p>
<p>According to this view, there is a right to be reintegrated into society and be al-
lowed to lead a quiet life if one has atoned for the crime by being sentenced and 
undergoing the punishment138.
</p>
<p>b.  Prerequisites for limiting the rights of the injuring party
</p>
<p>The protection of the victim&rsquo;s rights leads in such cases necessarily to a limita-
tion of the injuring party&rsquo;s freedom to express his opinion. The difficult issue is to 
what extent such limitation is justified.
</p>
<p>In relation to making a criminal record public, this is evaluated as follows139.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Degree to which the injuring party&rsquo;s rights are limited
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Grounds&emsp;for&emsp;freedom&emsp;of&emsp;expression&emsp;to&emsp;prevail
If society&rsquo;s interest with respect to the historical or social significance of the event, 
the importance of the people involved or the social activities of the victim or his 
influence is assessed as minor, there is hardly any reason to allow freedom to ex-
press one&rsquo;s opinion to prevail.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Extent&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;limitation&emsp;on&emsp;freedom&emsp;of&emsp;expression
</p>
<p>If the significance and necessity of using the correct name of the person involved 
is small in relation to the purpose and nature of the work, then freedom of expres-
sion is only negligibly impaired by a ban on using the real name.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Necessity for protection of victim&rsquo;s rights
If it is crucial for the victim with respect to his future life that his criminal record 
is not made public, then this justifies limiting the injuring party&rsquo;s right to free-
dom of expression.

<p>III.  Fault
</p>
<p>A.  The concept of fault
</p>
<p>In the context of fault, the first question is how the concept of fault is actually un-
derstood.
</p>
<p>1.  Subjective fault
</p>
<p>Previously the influential view was that fault means personal blameworthiness of 
the acting party.
</p>
<p>a.  Meaning of the concept
</p>
<p>According to this view, fault ( negligence ) means that the occurrence of the damage 
is not discerned due to defective exercise of will and the resulting lack of care140.
</p>
<p>b.  Purpose
</p>
<p>This is based on the idea that the party who does not adequately exercise his will 
is in any case liable for the compensation of the damage.
</p>
<p>2.  Objective fault
</p>
<p>Nowadays, however, the prevailing opinion is that fault is a ground that justifies 
imposing the liability to compensate the damage on the injuring party.
</p>
<p>a.  Meaning of the term
</p>
<p>Accordingly, fault ( negligence ) is seen as a breach of the duty to act with the care 
necessary to avoid the harmful result141.

105; Kat&ocirc;, Fuh&ocirc; k&ocirc;i [ Tort ] 64. However, as the care generally required in society is taken as the 
yardstick ( Wagatsuma,  Jimu kanri, fut&ocirc; ritoku, fuh&ocirc; k&ocirc;i [ Negotiorum gestio, unjust enrich-
ment and tort ] 105; Kat&ocirc;, Fuh&ocirc; k&ocirc;i [ Tort ] 68 f ), this already incorporates an objective element.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>b.  Purpose
</p>
<p>The underlying concept is that for liability to compensate the damage to be im-
posed, it is sufficient that the injuring party did not do what he was supposed to 
do. This is based on the following considerations.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Social change &ndash; increased risk
The basic premise is the assumption that today&rsquo;s society has seen qualitative 
changes, which means that the risk of rights infringements rises. On the one hand, 
the developments in high speed transportation, such as trains or cars, as well as 
enterprises that produce dangerous substances such as electricity or gas by using 
dangerous machines, and on the other hand, the intensification of social contacts 
between members of society, are material in this sense.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Increase of the need for protection and its impact on the 
concept of fault
</p>
<p>Against the background of these developments, the need for protection has risen. 
In order to meet this need, the crux must be whether someone did not do what he 
ought to have done or did something that he ought not to have done and not the 
exercise of his will to avoid the damage.
</p>
<p>B.  Object of fault
</p>
<p>1.  Problem issue
</p>
<p>The second question in the context of fault is which acts or omissions constitute 
fault.
</p>
<p>a.  Object of fault
</p>
<p>In general, there is deemed to be fault when the result is not avoided. If one as-
sumes that it is not admissible to infringe the rights of others, then at the least a 
duty to avoid the harmful result, ie the infringement of the rights, must be recog-
nised.
</p>
<p>b.  Duty to avoid the result
</p>
<p>This duty to avoid the result is based on the following considerations.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Basis of the duty &ndash; possibility of avoidance
If &ndash; without taking the will of the injuring party as the premise &ndash; it is assumed 
there was a breach of duty and thus liability is justifiable, this requires that the in-

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>juring party did not do what he could have done. For, if something which was not 
possible is required of him, this would be an excessive curtailment of the freedom 
and rights of the party accused of breaching a duty.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Material factor of possibility
The prerequisite that the injuring party could have done something involves the 
following two aspects:
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Avoidability
</p>
<p>Firstly, this means that the injuring party did not avoid the result although he 
could have.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Foreseeability
</p>
<p>Secondly, this means that the injuring party did not foresee the result although he 
could have foreseen it and accordingly prevented it.
</p>
<p>2.  Avoidability
</p>
<p>It is controversial whether avoidability must be assessed separately to foreseeability.
</p>
<p>a.  Foreseeability as sole prerequisite for the duty to avoid
</p>
<p>According to one view, a duty to avoid the result must be recognised if the result 
was foreseeable. The argument is that if the result is foreseeable, then it is not ad-
missible to engage in the damaging act and, thus, the result must be avoided by 
desisting from the act. This view requires that the harmful result be avoided by 
ending the damaging act142.
</p>
<p>b.  Avoidability as an additional prerequisite besides foreseeability
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is predominantly assumed that foreseeability of the result 
cannot automatically give rise to a duty to avoid it but instead that the existence of 
such a duty must be assessed with respect to the real avoidability in the situation. 
In this respect, the question is which measures may be required of the injuring 
party in order to avoid the result.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Reasonable measures of avoidance
Case law merely requires that reasonable measures be taken, as is usual in the 
case of such actions or activities143.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Argumentation
</p>
<p>Measures that exceed what is reasonable represent for the injuring party &raquo; some-
thing that he cannot do &laquo;, ie something impossible. Accordingly, even when the 
result is foreseeable, only reasonable measures can be required of him. Insofar as 
the injuring party has taken reasonable measures, he may continue with the rel-
evant act or activity.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Problem&emsp;issue
</p>
<p>This can be understood in two different ways; however, neither interpretation is 
unproblematic.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Maintenance	of	the	status	quo	on	the	part	of	the	injuring	party
</p>
<p>One possible interpretation is that measures to avoid damage may be required of 
the injuring party insofar on the balance as they are advantageous for the injuring 
party in comparison with his present situation. This means that the question of 
how far the injuring party&rsquo;s rights can be limited in order to protect the victim&rsquo;s 
rights is understood in the following sense: what is reasonable to require of the 
injuring party without impairing his rights ? This gives precedence to the status 
quo of the injuring party; however, it is far from self-evident that this interpreta-
tion is correct.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Emphasis	on	the	social	value
</p>
<p>According to the second possible interpretation, as long as the relevant act or 
activity has a general value for society, no further-reaching measures may be re-
quired than those which are reasonable in order to avoid the damage. The under-
lying idea is that society should not derive excessive disadvantage from the avoid-
ance of the result. However, taking such an interest on the part of the general 
public as a basis to refuse the victim protection of his factually endangered rights 
is problematic144.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Further possibilities
Besides these, the following views are also conceivable.

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Best&emsp;measure&emsp;of&emsp;avoidance
For instance, the standard may be that taking the most suitable measure with re-
spect to the relevant act or activity is required145.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Complete&emsp;avoidance
</p>
<p>On the other hand, even desisting from the act or activity can be required as the 
relevant measure146. If the result would still happen despite taking the best meas-
ure of avoidance, there remains only the option of completely desisting from the 
relevant act or activity.
</p>
<p>3.  Foreseeability
</p>
<p>a.  Necessity of foreseeability
</p>
<p>It is controversial whether foreseeability is a prerequisite for fault.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Foreseeability not necessary
One view holds that the injuring party is liable regardless of the foreseeability if he 
engages in an act resulting in a harmful result exceeding the limit of what must be 
tolerated by the victim147. The reason for this is that a strict requirement of foresee-
ability means that the victim would have to bear unforeseeable damage and thus 
the injuring party, who enjoys the advantages of the dangerous activity, would be 
freed from liability. This would not be a fair distribution of damage.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Foreseeability necessary
The majority consider, however, that foreseeabilty is a necessary prerequisite for 
establishing a duty of conduct148.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Reasoning
</p>
<p>This is for the following reasons.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Prerequisite	duty	of	conduct
Firstly, it is not possible to say that the injuring party had to avoid and could have 
avoided the result if he could not foresee the result.
</p>
<p>145 It is possible that the Appeal Court Osaka of 27. 12. 1919, Shinbun 1659, 11 ( new decision in the 
Osaka Alkali case after being referred back from the Imperial Court ) proceeded on this premise.

<p>bb.	 	Non	fault	based	liability	camouflaged	as	fault	liability
</p>
<p>Secondly, it would amount to recognition of non fault based liability under the 
cloak of fault liability if in such cases a duty of conduct and thus fault was as-
sumed149.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;What&emsp;must&emsp;be&emsp;foreseeable
</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is debate as to the object of the foreseeabiliy, ie what must be 
foreseeable.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Concrete	risk
</p>
<p>One view is that the specific result must be foreseen150. If the acting party only fore-
sees an abstract, undefined result, he does not know what measure he must take 
in order to avoid the result; therefore, it cannot be said that he would have been 
able to avoid the result.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Abstract	risk
</p>
<p>According to another view, it is sufficient that the occurrence of some disadvan-
tageous result be foreseeable in the abstract151. For at least when as yet unknown 
dangers are involved, such as in the case of environmental damage or damage due 
to medication, the ban on inflicting damage upon others requires that, if there is a 
risk of a rights infringement, information be obtained or scientific investigations 
carried out in order to avoid the damage.
</p>
<p>b.  Stricter duty to make efforts to foresee the damage
</p>
<p>In order to help the victim to obtain compensation for the damage, case law often 
proceeds on the basis that the injuring party has a duty to make efforts to recog-
nise the risk of damage. If such a duty is infringed, then it is assumed that there 
was foreseeability and thus a tougher yardstick is applied to this obligation to rec-
ognise.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Typified conduct rules
If there are typified conduct rules and these are violated, then it is no longer nec-
essary to take concrete foreseeability as the basis.

<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Typical&emsp;accidents
Regardless of the concrete foreseeability of the result, it is assumed that there is 
fault when typified duties of care are breached, for example traffic rules152.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Extraordinary&emsp;circumstances
</p>
<p>However, if extraordinary circumstances arise, no measures to prevent or avoid 
the damage can be expected from the injuring party if the concrete risk was not 
foreseeable. This can be seen as an application of the principle of reliance, accord-
ing to which it is admissible to rely in traffic on other drivers to observe the rules 
of conduct and will resort to reasonable conduct in order to avoid a crash with 
their car153.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Introduction of a duty to investigate
Further, a duty to investigate the specific dangerousness of the conduct can be im-
posed in the case of activities that involve high abstract risk for life and health. If 
someone does not comply with this duty, then the risk will be regarded as foresee-
able and there is clearly fault.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Medical&emsp;errors
</p>
<p>As far as medical errors are concerned, the doctor is obligated to collect informa-
tion as well as carry out investigations, surveys and observations in order to rec-
ognise a specific danger154.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Doctor&rsquo;s	duty	of	care
</p>
<p>According to the general doctrine, a person who must care for the life and health 
of people is obligated to exercise the greatest possible care that is necessary as a 
rule of experience in order to avoid the risk155.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Duty	to	ask
This leads to the doctor&rsquo;s duty to question the patient in a pertinent manner. If he 
breaches this duty, there is fault156.

</p>
<p>aaa.  Prerequisites
</p>
<p>The assumption of such a duty to ask firstly requires the existence of a certain ab-
stract danger. Furthermore, the questioning must represent an effective means of 
helping to avoid the danger.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Effects
</p>
<p>Accordingly, if the result would have been foreseeable had the doctor questioned 
appropriately but he did not, then if said result ensues it is assumed that the doc-
tor has breached the duty of care and, thus, there was fault.
</p>
<p>cc.	 	Stricter	duty	to	question
</p>
<p>This duty to question is even stricter in some cases.
</p>
<p>aaa.  Basis for and scope of the duty
</p>
<p>If, for instance, it is possible that an influenza vaccination may produce unusual 
side-effects which can lead to serious consequences ( eg death and encephalitis ) 
of the patient due to their physical constitution and predispositions, the doctor 
must fulfil the following duties in order to avoid this danger157.
</p>
<p>aaaa. Duty to make efforts to identify contraindications
</p>
<p>The doctor is obligated to diligently carry out a careful preliminary examination 
as to whether the vaccination is necessary for the patient and, if applicable, to pre-
cisely identify contraindications.
</p>
<p>bbbb.  Stricter duty to question
</p>
<p>In this context, it is not sufficient for the doctor to ask general and abstract ques-
tions about any health issues; rather he is obligated to ask concrete questions in-
sofar as such are necessary in order to identify contraindications158. If the relevant 
activity is carried out on a large scope, for example mass vaccinations, then it is 
difficult really to fulfil this duty in each and every case; insofar it is possible to 
speak of it being stricter.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Consequences of breaching this duty
If this duty is breached, it is presumed that the responsible physician did not fore-
see the result due to negligence, although it would have been possible for him to 
foresee it159.

In the case of environmental damage and damage from medication, the courts 
have sometimes imposed on the relevant entrepreneur a duty to investigate and 
research as well as collect information, in order to be able to recognise a concrete 
danger160.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Environmental	damage
aaa.  Basis and scope of the duties
</p>
<p>If, for example, it is not known in a chemical enterprise where chemistry knowl-
edge is constantly being further developed and large quantities of chemical prod-
ucts are manufactured, which substances are generated as side-products in these 
processes, meaning that these may include toxins that are highly dangerous to 
humans and other life forms, the following duties are imposed upon the entrepre-
neur in order to avoid such dangers161.
</p>
<p>aaaa. Duty of the corporate management
</p>
<p>The entrepreneur must usually manage the factories so that it is certain that no 
toxins can escape from the enterprise.
</p>
<p>bbbb.  Stricter duty to research
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the enterprise must apply the most advanced technologies to carry 
out analyses when it wants to release sewage from the factories into rivers, etc and 
examine the sewage for toxins as well as the features and quantity of such and on 
this basis take completely secure measures to avoid endangering people and other 
life forms162.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Consequences of breaching the duty
</p>
<p>If an enterprise breaches the above duty to investigate, then the foreseeability of 
the result is presumed and on this basis a duty to avoid the result is imposed.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Damage	from	medication
aaa.  Basis and scope of the duty
</p>
<p>If, for example, a pharmaceutical enterprise manufactures a medication that is 
directly ingested by the human body, there is a possibility that by taking the medi-
cine a large number of people will be exposed to a high risk. In order to avoid this 
risk, the following duties are imposed upon pharmaceutical enterprises163.

<p>aaaa. New medications
</p>
<p>When it comes to a new medication, there is a duty to carry out in-vitro tests, ani-
mal testing and clinical studies in line with the highest technological standards 
before the medication is placed on the market.
</p>
<p>bbbb.  Medications already on the market
</p>
<p>In the case of medications that are already on the market, there is a duty to con-
tinue collecting literature and information. If these should give occasion for 
doubt as to side-effects, there is the duty to establish clarity as soon as possible 
as regards the existence and extent of these side-effects in relation to the relevant 
medicine, in that according to the seriousness of the doubts raised, for instance, 
animal testing is carried out or the medical records regarding the relevant medica-
tion are examined and follow-up investigations conducted.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Consequences of breaching the duty
</p>
<p>The above-cited duty corresponds to a duty to take all reasonable measures in or-
der to foresee the risk; if the pharmaceutical company breaches this duty then the 
foreseeability of the result is assumed and thus also a duty to avoid the result164.
</p>
<p>c.  Classification of the research duty
</p>
<p>As shown above, when it comes to business operations with high abstract dan-
gerousness, a duty to research is often assumed. However, there are two different 
views on how this duty is classified.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   As a duty to foresee the damage
According to one view, this duty consists in undertaking all reasonable measures 
to be able to foresee the damage165.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Foreseeability
According to this view, foreseeability is assumed if the duty to research is breached. 
This means that the duty to investigate extends the number of cases in which it is 
possible to proceed on the basis that the damage was foreseeable.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Avoidability
</p>
<p>In a further step, it must be examined whether the foreseeable danger could have 
been avoided.

<p>(   2  )   As a duty to avoid the result
According to the other view, the breach of the duty to investigate means there was 
fault166. This can be reasoned as follows.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Protection&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;victim&rsquo;s&emsp;rights
</p>
<p>If there is a high risk of serious infringement of a right, then it can be assumed 
from the outset that there is a duty to avert it. This consists in the duty to investi-
gate too.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Limitation&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;injuring&emsp;party&rsquo;s&emsp;rights
</p>
<p>If the necessary investigation is not carried out although it would have been pos-
sible, and if a right has been infringed, then the injuring party is liable.
</p>
<p>C.  Yardstick for fault
</p>
<p>1.  Method for assessing negligence
</p>
<p>The very first question that arises in relation to the fault standard is how duties of 
conduct can be determined as prerequisite for negligence.
</p>
<p>a.  Learned-Hand formula
</p>
<p>An influential view sees a method for this in the formula developed by Learned 
Hand167.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Yardstick for assessment
According to this, the weight of the infringed interests and the probability of the 
damage ( A ) occurring must be weighed up against the interests ( B ) impaired by 
the imposition of the conduct duty. If A outweighs B, then the duty of conduct 
must be recognised. This means that if these utilitarian considerations imported 
from US-American law are applied, the following two advantages can be weighed 
up against each other in order to assess fault.
</p>
<p>166 This is particularly true in cases in which it would have been easy to avoid the result if it had 
only been foreseen. Supreme Court of 16. 2. 1961, Minsh&ucirc; 15&ndash;2, 244 is an example of such a case.

<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Benefit&emsp;that&emsp;the&emsp;victim&emsp;gains&emsp;from&emsp;the&emsp;definition&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;
conduct&emsp;duty
</p>
<p>Firstly, there is the benefit that the victim would derive from the determination of 
the conduct duty ( A ). This consists of two elements.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Weight	of	the	infringed	interests
</p>
<p>One element is the weight of the infringed interests. Into consideration must 
be taken: ( 1 ) life, bodily integrity, liberty, ( 2 ) property and other in rem rights,  
( 3 ) claims, ( 4 ) other interests ( eg light, air, view, reputation, private sphere ).
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Probability	of	the	result	occurring
</p>
<p>The other element is the probability of the result ocurring. In this respect, for in-
stance, ( 1 ) the dangerous act and ( 2 ) the generation, continuation, control or care 
of the source of danger must be taken into account.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Value&emsp;that&emsp;is&emsp;lost&emsp;by&emsp;determination&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;conduct&emsp;duty
</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the matter of the value that would be lost ( B ) by establishing 
a conduct duty. In this respect, the following disadvantages must be considered.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Disadvantages	for	the	injuring	party
</p>
<p>On the one hand, there are disadvantages for the injuring party ( B1 ), consisting for 
example in the costs of avoidance.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Disadvantages	for	the	victim
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there may be disadvantages for the victim ( B2 ), for instance 
the loss of interests that he could have gained from the activity of the injuring 
party must be taken into account ( eg in the case of medical treatment or medica-
tion ).
</p>
<p>cc.	 	Disadvantages	for	society
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the disadvantages for the general public ( B3 ) must be taken into ac-
count; in this respect, the basis is the usefulness of the injuring party&rsquo;s activity for 
society ( eg in the use of cars or pharmaceuticals or in preventing illnesses ).
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Problems
The Hand formula poses the following problems, however.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Lack&emsp;of&emsp;justification
</p>
<p>Firstly, there is no clarification as to why these factors relevant under American 
law should also be taken into consideration when weighing up matters under Jap-
anese law.

<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Problem&emsp;issues&emsp;when&emsp;it&emsp;comes&emsp;to&emsp;weighing&emsp;up&emsp;the&emsp;benefits
Secondly, weighing up the benefits using the Hand formula involves the following 
problems168.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Costs	of	avoidance
</p>
<p>As this is solely a weighing up of costs, there is substantial risk that the protection 
of the victim&rsquo;s rights fade into the background.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Social	value
</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a considerable danger that businesses generating value for 
the general public will be prioritised over the rights of the victim. Unlike in the 
case of a preventive injunction, the victim is completely unprotected if no com-
pensation is granted.
</p>
<p>b.  Methods for weighing up rights against each other
</p>
<p>In order to assess whether there has been a tort, it is necessary to weigh up the vic-
tim&rsquo;s and the injuring party&rsquo;s rights against each other. The Hand formula can also 
be adapted into a method for such a balancing up of rights169.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Significance of the requirement of fault
The law of delicts serves to protect the rights of the victim against interference by 
the injuring party. However, if delictual liability is recognised in order to protect 
the victim&rsquo;s rights, this leads to a limitation of the injuring party&rsquo;s rights. In con-
nection with the requirement of fault, the question arises as to whether it is justi-
fiable to limit the injuring party&rsquo;s rights in order to protect the victim&rsquo;s rights and 
impose certain duties of conduct.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Degree to which the injuring party&rsquo;s rights are limited
In this respect, the first question is how far the injuring party&rsquo;s rights are limited 
by the imposition of a duty of conduct.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Guidelines&emsp;for&emsp;weighing&emsp;up&emsp;the&emsp;rights
</p>
<p>The more the injuring party&rsquo;s rights are restricted by imposing the duty of con-
duct, the weightier the grounds for such a limitation must be. This corresponds to 
element B1 in the Hand formula.

<p>625Part 6&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;elements&emsp;of&emsp;imputation
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Significance&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;principle&emsp;of&emsp;fault-based&emsp;liability
According to the fundamental principle of fault-based liability, foreseeability and 
avoidability are basic principles for imposing a duty to avoid the result. This can 
be classified as follows.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Foreseeability
</p>
<p>If a duty to avoid the result is imposed even though such result was not foresee-
able, this would be a heavy restriction on the injuring party&rsquo;s rights.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Avoidability
</p>
<p>If, furthermore, the duty to avoid the result is imposed and it is assumed there 
was a breach of duty even though the result was not avoidable, this also leads to a 
heavy restriction on the rights of the injuring party.
</p>
<p>(   3  )   Justification for the restriction of the injuring party&rsquo;s rights
There must be sufficient grounds to justify imposing an avoidance duty upon the 
injuring party although this restricts his rights.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Necessity&emsp;to&emsp;protect&emsp;the&emsp;victim&rsquo;s&emsp;rights
</p>
<p>If grave infringement of the victim&rsquo;s rights and a high probability of the rights 
infringement is at stake, then a corresponding restriction of the injuring party&rsquo;s 
rights is justified, insofar as the victim&rsquo;s rights can only be protected by recognis-
ing such an avoidance duty. This corresponds to element A in the Hand formula. 
In particular in relation to conduct with a high risk of grave infringements to life, 
bodily integrity or health, for instance in the case of environmental damage or 
damage from medication, imposing an avoidance duty upon the injuring party is 
justifiable even when avoidabilty and even foreseeability are low.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Advantages&emsp;for&emsp;the&emsp;victim
</p>
<p>If the victim himself derives advantages from the injuring party&rsquo;s activities, for 
example in the case of damage from medication, the need to protect the rights of 
the victim is correspondingly lower. This corresponds to element B2 of the Hand 
formula. In this context, the extent of the advantages in comparison to the rights 
infringement must be evaluated.
</p>
<p>2.  Yardstick with respect to the person
</p>
<p>The second problem is what ought to be the yardstick for an individual when de-
termining the conduct duty.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>a.  Culpa in concreto and in abstracto ( concrete and abstract fault )
</p>
<p>There are two views in this respect.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Acting party as yardstick &ndash; culpa in concreto ( concrete fault )
According to one view, the abilities of the specific acting party must be taken as 
the standard170. Accordingly, there is fault if the respective acting party breaches 
the duty to act within the powers of his own abilities.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Average person as yardstick &ndash; culpa in abstracto ( abstract 
fault )
</p>
<p>According to another view, the abilities of an average person are to be taken as the 
standard171. According to this, there is fault if the acting party breaches the duty 
to act as is required of an average person in the relevant social group. This in turn 
has two aspects.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Imputation
</p>
<p>Firstly, the excuse that one does not have the abilities of an average person is not 
admissible. In social life one is obliged to act at least with the level of abilities ex-
pected of the average person. This requirement leads to no excessive restriction of 
the injuring party&rsquo;s rights.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Exoneration
</p>
<p>Secondly, the injuring party is not liable if he acted in the manner reasonably to be 
expected of the average person. If an action is required that goes beyond what can 
be demanded of an average person, then this would lead to excessive restriction of 
the injuring party&rsquo;s rights.
</p>
<p>b.  Types of culpa in abstracto ( abstract fault ) &ndash; using the example of 
medical liability
</p>
<p>The question is what can be expected of an average person. As this depends on 
the specific features of the respective social group to which the acting party be-
longs, for example knowledge, profession, social position, place and experience, 
it is necessary to form categories172.

</p>
<p>(   1  )   Yardstick for determining a duty &ndash; medical standard
A doctor, for example, is obligated to conduct appropriate medical treatment in 
line with medical standards.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Significance&emsp;of&emsp;medical&emsp;standards
</p>
<p>Medical standards mean those standards that apply in the practice of clinical 
medicine.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Difference	to	scientific	standard
</p>
<p>Thus, if treatment methods that are not yet widespread and tried-and-tested in 
clinical medicine are used, this is not necessarily a breach of a duty of conduct 
( fault )173.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Difference	to	actual	practice
</p>
<p>Neither is it material how an average doctor actually behaved; instead the yard-
stick is the standard with which he should comply174.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Normative&emsp;significance&emsp;of&emsp;medical&emsp;standards
</p>
<p>In practice this has the following significance.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Duty	to	investigate	and	duty	of	further	education
</p>
<p>A doctor may not invoke the excuse that he did not know something which is part 
of the medical standard. Therefore, a doctor is obligated to investigate what the 
medical standard is and to acquire the necessary knowledge.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Duty	to	refer	patients	on
</p>
<p>If a doctor is not able to carry out a medical treatment in line with the medical 
standards, he must refer the patient to a suitable medical facility175.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Relativity of medical standards
(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Individual&emsp;abilities&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;acting&emsp;party
</p>
<p>If the acting party coincidentally has knowledge and abilities that exceed the med-
ical standard, this does not automatically mean stricter duties of conduct apply176.

The medical standard is not uniformly established but is determined according to 
what it is reasonable to expect of the relevant medical establishment. Specifically, 
circumstances such as the type of medical establishment and local specifics of the 
medical treatment must be taken into account177.

</p>
<p>1.  Rule for liability in respect of auxiliaries
</p>
<p>The CC provides for the following rule on liability in respect of auxiliaries.
</p>
<p>a.  Liability of the principal
</p>
<p>Whoever engages another to execute a certain business for him, is obligated to 
compensate for damage inflicted upon third parties by this other person in execu-
tion of that business ( art 715 para 1 CC )178.
</p>
<p>b.  Possibility for principal to be exonerated
</p>
<p>In the following cases the principal may be exonerated ( art 715 para 1 sent 2 CC ).
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Due care in selecting and supervising
Firstly, when the principal has exercised appropriate care in selecting the auxilia-
ries and supervising them during the execution of the business.
</p>
<p>177 Cf Supreme Court of 9. 6. 2005, Minsh&ucirc; 49&ndash;6, 1499.
178 Art 715 para 1 CC states: &raquo; A person who employs others for a certain business shall be liable for 
</p>
<p>damage inflicted on a third party by his / her employees with respect to the execution of that 
business; provided, however, that this shall not apply if the employer exercised reasonable 
care in appointing the employee or in supervising the business, or if the damage could not 
have been avoided even if he / she had exercised reasonable care &laquo;.

<p>(   2  )   No causation
Secondly, if the damage would also have occurred had reasonable care been ap-
plied.
</p>
<p>2.  Nature of liability for auxiliaries
</p>
<p>There is controversy as to the rationale for the liability of the principal179.
</p>
<p>a.  Legislative process
</p>
<p>In the process of elaborating the CC, the rule on liability for auxiliaries passed 
through the following changes180.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Old CC
In the old CC ( art 373 on Property Law ) the liability for auxiliaries was understood 
as follows.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Liability&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;principal&emsp;for&emsp;his&emsp;own&emsp;behaviour
</p>
<p>The reason for the principal&rsquo;s liability was because he was negligent in selecting or 
supervising the auxiliaries according to this provision.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;No&emsp;exculpatory&emsp;grounds
However, the principal&rsquo;s negligence was presumed. Besides this, there was no pro-
vision that allowed for rebuttal of this presumption by proving that there was in 
fact no negligence.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;iii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Tort&emsp;by&emsp;the&emsp;auxiliaries
</p>
<p>As the liability of the principal is vicarious for the auxiliaries, it was a prerequisite 
that there have been a tort by the auxiliary.

</p>
<p>(   2  )   Applicable CC
The authors of today&rsquo;s CC, on the other hand, understood liability for auxiliaries 
as follows.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Liability&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;principal&emsp;for&emsp;his&emsp;own&emsp;behaviour
</p>
<p>The reason for the principal&rsquo;s liability, according to this view, was that the princi-
pal himself was negligent when selecting and supervising the auxiliaries.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Introduction&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;provision&emsp;on&emsp;exculpatory&emsp;grounds&emsp;for&emsp;the&emsp;
principal
</p>
<p>Unlike the old CC, today&rsquo;s CC expressly releases the principal from liability if he 
exercised appropriate care not only in selecting the auxiliaries but also in super-
vising them. If the principal was always made liable for the conduct of auxiliaries, 
it would no longer be possible nowadays, when one so often engages other people, 
to contract for something without undue worry.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;iii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Tort&emsp;by&emsp;the&emsp;auxiliary
</p>
<p>It remained open whether a tort by the auxiliary himself is a prerequisite.
</p>
<p>b.  Liability for the tort of the auxiliary
</p>
<p>Subsequently, the view prevailed that when it comes to liability for auxiliaries, the 
principal is liable to the victim for the tort of the auxiliaries181. This means that li-
ability for auxiliaries is understood as liability for tort by another person. Besides 
the principal&rsquo;s liability, however, the auxiliaries&rsquo; own liability for their tort also 
continues to exist.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Tort by an auxiliary
According to this view, it is necessary that the auxiliary&rsquo;s act in itself fulfils all 
the prerequisites for a tort ( infringement of a right, intention and / or negligence, 
damage ).

(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Grounds
</p>
<p>This heavier burden in comparison to art 709 for the principal is justified as fol-
lows182.

</p>
<p>aa.	 	Liability	due	to	obtaining	a	benefit
</p>
<p>As the principal draws a benefit from using auxiliaries to perform an activity, he 
must also be liable for torts arising in this context.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Liability	for	creating	a	risk
</p>
<p>As the principal has created or increased a risk by using auxiliaries, he is liable for 
the manifestation of the risk due to the auxiliaries. However, there is no need to 
examine whether in the specific case any risk was created or increased.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Significance&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;rule&emsp;exculpating&emsp;the&emsp;principal&emsp;from&emsp;
liability
</p>
<p>According to this, the exculpation of the principal has nothing to do with fault in 
the sense of art 709 CC but instead is based on policy considerations. Due to the 
principles of liability on the basis of deriving a benefit and of liability for danger-
ous activity, however, as far as possible no exculpation from liability should be rec-
ognised in the case of absence of fault with respect to selecting or supervising the 
auxiliaries, so that in effect there is non fault based liability183.
</p>
<p>(   3  )   Criticism
With respect to the understanding of liability for auxiliaries as liability in lieu of 
the auxiliaries, meaning it is a prerequisite that there have been a tort by said aux-
iliaries, the following problematic issues have been highlighted184.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Problems&emsp;with&emsp;respect&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;protection&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;victim
aa.	 	Difficulties	with	identifying	the	auxiliary	and	proof	of	fault
</p>
<p>If damage arises within a corporate operation, it is hard for victims outside of the 
enterprise to determine which specific auxiliary within the company committed 
the damaging act and to prove the fault of said auxiliary.
</p>

on gaining a benefit.

</p>
<p>bb.	 	Problem	of	exculpation	from	liability	in	the	case	of	someone	
who	has	no	capacity	to	commit	a	delict
</p>
<p>If, moreover, the auxiliary is incapable of committing a delict, it would contradict 
the principles of liability due to deriving a benefit or liability due to increased dan-
ger if the principal were always to be exculpated from liability in such a case.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Danger&emsp;of&emsp;excessive&emsp;liability&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;auxiliary
In case law there is a tendency to set the duties of conduct for auxiliaries very high 
in order to make it more likely that the principal be held liable. However, there 
is no justification for imposing stricter duties of conduct on the auxiliary, who 
merely carries out the instructions of the principal, than on other people.
</p>
<p>c.  Liability for one&rsquo;s own conduct &ndash; liability for own tort
</p>
<p>In order to resolve this problem, the following approaches have been developed.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Direct liability
It is argued that art 715 CC provides for direct liability of the principal for the aux-
iliaries185.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Liability&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;principal
This is based on the idea that if liability for auxiliaries is based on the fundamen-
tal concepts of deriving an advantage and creating a danger, the actual object of 
the liability is not the auxiliary but the principal.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Tort&emsp;by&emsp;the&emsp;auxiliary
aa.	 	Fault	of	the	auxiliary
</p>
<p>According to this view, not only is the auxiliary free from liability but neither is it 
required that he acted culpably &ndash; negligently or intentionally.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Wrongfulness	of	the	action	inflicting	damage
According to this, it is sufficient that the auxiliary&rsquo;s damaging action is objectively 
wrongful.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Liability of the entrepreneur
Furthermore, it is argued that there has also been a tort on the part of the entre-
preneur himself and therefore, that the entrepreneur is liable directly for the aux-
iliary under art 709186.

This can be justified as follows.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	View	from	outside
If damage arises in the course of the ordinary operation of a business, then the 
question of who was involved in the tort is simply an internal matter for the com-
pany; for the victim outside the company, however, the company itself appears as 
the damaging party.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Entrepreneur&rsquo;s	duty	of	conduct
</p>
<p>Further, it is possible to recognise corresponding duties of conduct for the entre-
preneur, ie operational, organisational duties187.

</p>
<p>According to this, liability for auxiliaries may be understood as liability in the 
stead of the auxiliary and enterprise liability may be imposed separately188.
</p>

</p>
<p>1.  Liability of the possessor of a building
</p>
<p>a.  Significance
</p>
<p>If another person suffers damage due to defects in the construction or mainte-
nance of a building, the following liability rules apply.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Primary liability of the possessor
Firstly, insofar as there is a possessor of the building, such is liable to compensate 
the damage ( art 717 para 1 sent 1 CC ).
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Subsidiary liability of the owner
Secondly, the owner of the building is liable to compensate the damage if there is 
no possessor or if the possessor exercised the necessary care to avoid the damage 
( art 717 para 1 sent 2 CC ).
</p>

</p>
<p>b.  Purpose
(  1  )   Nature of liability
</p>
<p>The liability for buildings features the following specifics.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Liability&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;possessor
The liability of the possessor is an interim type between fault based and non-fault 
based liability.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Basis	for	liability	&ndash;	fault-based	liability
</p>
<p>The possessor&rsquo;s liability is based on the assumption that there was a defect re-
garding the construction or maintenance of the building in his possession and 
that the possessor of this building did not take the necessary measures in order 
to avoid the damage.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Reversal	of	burden	of	proof
</p>
<p>Unlike under art 709 CC, the possessor can only exculpate himself from liability by 
proving that he took the necessary measures to avoid the damage.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Liability&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;owner
</p>
<p>No such exculpatory grounds are provided for, however, for the owner. He is liable 
due to the defect in the construction or maintenance of the building regardless 
of the cause of the defect, the point in time the defect arose or whether counter-
measures were taken or not.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Basis for making the liability stricter &ndash; principle of strict 
liability based on dangerousness
</p>
<p>This takes as a premise the idea that the party who controls and administers a de-
fective and thus dangerous building must bear the damage that results from this 
danger manifesting189.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Liability&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;possessor
</p>
<p>The possessor of the building not only has the duty to take the necessary meas-
ures to avoid the damage but also bears the burden of having to justify his own 
conduct, ie the burden of proof that there was no fault involved.

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Liability&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;owner
As owner of the dangerous building, the owner has the duty to compensate the 
damage that another has sustained due to this danger.
</p>
<p>2.  Product liability
</p>
<p>a.  Significance
</p>
<p>Product liability is the liability of producers and other people to compensate dam-
age that is caused to someone else &ndash; this may be the purchaser or another party &ndash; 
by a defect in the product injuring their life, bodily integrity or assets ( arts 1 and 3 
Product Liability Act )190. The Product Liability Act was promulgated in 1994 as a 
special law to govern product liability.
</p>
<p>b.  Special features
</p>
<p>In comparison to the general law of delicts, the Product Liability Act displays the 
following special features.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   From fault-based liability to liability for a defect
The producer is liable regardless of fault if someone else has sustained damage 
due to a defect in the product.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Relief&emsp;in&emsp;the&emsp;case&emsp;of&emsp;evidentiary&emsp;problems&emsp;with&emsp;respect&emsp;&emsp;
to&emsp;fault
</p>
<p>While it is usually extremely difficult to prove whether fault has occurred during a 
complicated production process, proving a defect in the product is relatively easy. 
This means that the legal means for relief available to the victim is more easily 
enforceable.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Victim&rsquo;s&emsp;burden&emsp;of&emsp;proof
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, pursuant to the general basic rules, the victim not only has the bur-
den of proof in relation to the defect in the product but also for causation.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Exculpatory grounds for the producer
The producer can only free himself from liability by proving that due to the cur-
rent state of science and technology at the time of handover the defect could not 
be discovered. This is based on the &ndash; heavily criticised &ndash; consideration that the fol-
lowing difficulties would arise if this defence was not allowed.

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Consumers&rsquo;&emsp;interests
Firstly, there would be a risk that producers be hesitant to deliver new, especially 
dangerous products and consumers would no longer gain the benefits, for in-
stance, of new medications promptly.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Producers&rsquo;&emsp;interests
</p>
<p>Furthermore, there would be a risk that producers lose interest in developing new 
products.
</p>
<p>V.  Dangerousness
</p>
<p>A.  Significance of strict liability for dangerousness
</p>
<p>Liability based on dangerousness means that when an accident is brought about 
due to a socially necessary source of danger, the keeper of the source of danger is 
liable regardless of whether there is fault. No caps by maximum amounts are pro-
vided for in the individual special laws.
</p>
<p>1.  Necessity for liability based on dangerousness
</p>
<p>The necessity for non fault based liability is argued as follows.
</p>
<p>a.  Social necessity of the source of danger
</p>
<p>Firstly, this concerns cases in which it is not possible to forbid the dangerous ac-
tivity or possession of the dangerous thing as the activity or thing is essential to 
society despite the danger involved.
</p>
<p>b.  Accident without fault
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is often the case that accidents due to the dangerous activity or 
thing cannot be avoided even when the keeper of the source of danger acts with 
due care. If fault-based liability was the starting point here, then those whose 
rights are infringed would be completely unprotected.
</p>
<p>2.  Principles of imputation in respect of non fault based liability
</p>
<p>The following two principles are generally cited as the foundation for such non 
fault based liability.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>a.  Principle of liability for a danger
</p>
<p>Firstly, it is possible that the controllability of the source of danger be drawn on as 
the basis for imputation. The underlying idea is that the person who controls the 
dangerous activity or thing is liable for the resulting damage.
</p>
<p>b.  Principle of liability on the basis of drawing a benefit
</p>
<p>Secondly, imputation can be reasoned on the basis of benefits being derived from 
the source of danger. The underlying concept is that the person who is allowed to 
carry out the dangerous activity or possess the dangerous thing and thus derives 
a benefit, is liable for the resulting damage.
</p>
<p>B.  Statutory rules providing for strict liability based on 
dangerousness
</p>
<p>Such liability based on dangerousness is provided for in various special laws in Ja-
pan, the analogous application of which is rejected. At present there is no talk of 
a general rule. Examples:

<p>Part 7 Limitations of liability
</p>
<p>I.  Limitation as regards causation
</p>
<p>As explained above in Chapter 5 II. A. ( no 7 / 289 ), the concept of causality and its 
delimitations are controversial.
</p>
<p>A.  Adequacy theory
</p>
<p>According to the traditionally dominant theory191 and case law192, it is a prerequi-
site for delictual liability that there be an adequate causal link between the dam-
aging act and the result.
</p>
<p>1.  Definition of adequate causation
</p>
<p>a.  Concept
</p>
<p>Adequate causation means that the damage would not have arisen without the 
damaging act and that it is a usual consequence of such an act193.
</p>
<p>b.  Purpose
</p>
<p>The underlying idea is that only the legally relevant part of a potentially, infinite 
chain of causation ought to be taken into consideration. Since besides this, no le-
gal causation is assumed, the area imputable to the damaging party is limited to 
a reasonable extent.

</p>
<p>2.  Analoguous application of art 416 CC
</p>
<p>a.  Interpretation of art 416 CC
(  1  )   Ordinary damage
</p>
<p>It is generally considered that art 416 para 1 CC sets out the principle of adequate 
causation. According to this provision, the damage that would usually arise due 
to failure to perform an obligation, ie that is connected by an adequate causal link 
to such failure, must be compensated.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Special damage
Article 416 para 2 CC further stipulates which circumstances are to be taken into 
account when assessing whether there was adequate causation. According to this, 
even special circumstances that the parties foresaw or could have foreseen must 
be taken into account when assessing whether there is an adequate causal link 
with the failure to perform the obligation.
</p>
<p>b.  Analogous application to torts
</p>
<p>It is argued that art 416 CC contains general principles of tort and thus, naturally, 
is not only applicable to failure to perform obligations but also by analogy to 
torts194.
</p>
<p>3.  Problems with the adequacy theory
</p>
<p>However, the following criticisms are made in relation to the adequacy theory.
</p>
<p>a.  Applicability in Japan
</p>
<p>The critics point out that the adequacy theory originates from German law and, 
therefore, that it is not appropriate in Japanese law since this is based on different 
prerequisites195.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   German law
German law takes the principle of full compensation as its premise, according to 
which the entire damage that is causally connected with the failure to perform 
must be compensated if the prerequisites for a compensation claim have been 
met. The adequacy theory serves to limit the liability to a reasonable scope.

(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Differences&emsp;with&emsp;respect&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;principles&emsp;of&emsp;compensation
</p>
<p>Article 416 CC, on the other hand, is based on the reception of English law, namely 
the rule established in Hadley v Baxendale and thus it follows the principle of re-
strictive compensation. According to this, the damage that would ordinarily arise 
must be compensated, but not damage that arose due to special circumstances, 
insofar as such were not foreseeable. This means, however, precisely that there 
are cases in which damage is not recoverable although it is causally linked with 
the failure to perform an obligation, ie that the scope of the recoverable damage 
is limited from the outset. Consequently, the prerequisites for applying the ad-
equacy theory are missing from Japanese law.
</p>

</p>
<p>The purpose of art 416 CC lies further in granting a party compensation for the im-
pairment of his interests that ought to have been furthered by the contract, this hav-
ing been frustrated by the failure to perform. This is not the case with respect to torts.
</p>
<p>b.  Unclear yardstick
</p>
<p>The second point of criticism is that the yardstick for adequate causation is un-
clear.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Lack of clarity
Firstly, there is no way to clearly state what an adequate causal link constitutes. 
Therefore, the result is frequently merely described using other words.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Manifold assessment factors
In reality, assessing whether causation is adequate involves a whole range of dif-
ferent aspects. While the term &raquo; adequate causation &laquo; is always spoken of, in fact 
very diverse factors are decisive.
</p>
<p>B.  Three-step approach
</p>
<p>Nowadays, an approach that seeks to examine the issues related to adequate causa-
tion, which were hitherto examined together, separately in three steps196 is influential.

</p>
<p>1.  Factual causation
</p>
<p>As the first step, thus, the existence of a factual connection must be examined, ie 
whether the damaging act actually caused the material result.
</p>
<p>2.  Protective scope
</p>
<p>In a second step, there is a legal evaluation of how far the result that is factually 
linked in terms of causation can be imputed to the damaging party.
</p>
<p>3.  Assessment of damage
</p>
<p>In the third step, the question is how the damage that falls within the protective 
scope can be measured in monetary terms.
</p>
<p>II.  Yardstick to determine the protective scope
</p>
<p>There is debate on which yardstick should be used to determine the protective 
scope. In this respect, the following two opinions are variously supported; they dif-
fer as to whether they distinguish between the primary and consequential harm.
</p>
<p>A.  Uniform yardstick
</p>
<p>The traditional understanding is that no distinction is made between the primary 
harm and consequential harm; instead the protective scope is determined accord-
ing to a uniform yardstick.
</p>
<p>1.  Adequacy theory
</p>
<p>According to the traditionally dominant theory and case law outlined above, the 
protective scope is determined on the basis of adequacy. Nonetheless, it has al-
ready been pointed out that this yardstick is not sufficiently clear and definite.
</p>
<p>2.  Protective purpose of the duty
</p>
<p>a.  Significance
</p>
<p>By contrast, it is also argued that the damaging party is liable for all harm within 
the area to which the conduct duties he infringed related. Thus, the question of

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>whether there is liability depends on whether the infringement of the right falls 
within the protective purpose of the conduct rule violated by the damaging party.
</p>
<p>b.  Yardstick for assessment
</p>
<p>According to this approach, liability or not is determined based on the following 
elements.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Occurrence of the result
Firstly, it is a prerequisite that occurrence of the result ( infringement of a right or 
damage ) is established.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Factual causation
Furthermore, there must be a factual causal link between the result and the dam-
aging party&rsquo;s act.
</p>
<p>(   3  )   Establishing a duty of conduct
Beyond this, it must be determined whether the damaging party has a duty to pre-
vent the result occurring. As described above in Part 6 II., this must be examined 
using the Learned-Hand formula. This means that ( A ), the weight of the interests 
infringed and the probability of the result occurring, must be weighed up against 
( B ), the interests that would be sacrificed by imposing the conduct duty, with a 
conduct duty being assumed if A outweighs B.
</p>
<p>(   4  )   Assessment of the protective purpose of the duty
If it is concluded that the damaging party has such a duty, then it must be deter-
mined whether the infringement of the right or the damage lies within the protec-
tive scope of the damaging party&rsquo;s duty of conduct.
</p>
<p>B.  Distinction between primary and consequential harm
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is also an influential opinion to the effect that a distinc-
tion must be drawn between the primary and consequential harm and that this  
means imputability to the damaging party must be examined in a twofold man-
ner197.
</p>
<p>197 See on this, eg, Maeda, Minp&ocirc; IV-2 ( Fuh&ocirc; k&ocirc;i-h&ocirc; ) [ Civil law IV-2 ( Law of torts ) ] 130 ff, 302 ff; Shi-
nomiya, Fuh&ocirc; k&ocirc;i [ Tort ] 431 f, 449 f; Shiomi, Fuh&ocirc; k&ocirc;i-h&ocirc; [ Law of tort ] 178 f; idem, Fuh&ocirc; k&ocirc;i-h&ocirc; I

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>1.  Primary harm &ndash; protective purpose of the duty
</p>
<p>According to this view, the question of whether the primary harm falls within the 
relevant protective scope must be answered based on the extent of the purpose 
ascribed to the rule giving rise to the duty. This is in line with the assessment of 
fault in the objective sense.
</p>
<p>2.  Consequential harm &ndash; connection with wrongfulness
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the question of whether the consequential harm falls within 
the protective scope must be examined in the context of the wrongfulness aspect.
</p>
<p>a.  Concept behind the wrongfulness aspect
</p>
<p>The idea behind the wrongfulness aspect is that when the especial danger trig-
gered by the primary harm manifests, the damaging party responsible for the pri-
mary harm is also liable for this consequential result.
</p>
<p>b.  Underlying ideas
</p>
<p>This is based on the following considerations.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   General risk of life &ndash; casus sentit dominum
In principle, it is the rule that the owner of the right ( victim ) must himself bear 
the risks of everyday life.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Especial dangers
If the damaging party, however, has created a danger exceeding that of the general 
risks of life due to the primary harm brought about by his intention or negligence, 
then he is also liable for the consequences of this danger being realised. This is 
significant in the following sense.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Requirement&emsp;of&emsp;intention&emsp;or&emsp;negligence
If the damaging party committed the primary harm intentionally or negligently, 
then he is liable for the consequential harm even if there is no intention or negli-
gence in this respect.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Limitation&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;realisation&emsp;of&emsp;an&emsp;especial&emsp;danger
</p>
<p>However, if the result is not due to the realisation of a special danger created by 
the primary harm, then such must be seen in itself as primary harm so that once 
again intention and negligence must be determined.

</p>
<p>III.  Types of consequential harm
</p>
<p>In the following, some specific problems connected with consequential harm will 
be examined.
</p>
<p>A.  Consequential harm and the same victim
</p>
<p>One group of cases consists of consequential harm in relation to the same victim 
that suffered the first damage. Within this group, two sup-groups can be distin-
guished, depending on who causes the consequential harm.
</p>
<p>1.  Damage inflicted by a third party
</p>
<p>The first sub-group are cases in which the consequential damage is brought about 
by a third party, other than the damaging party that caused the primary harm. 
This is the case, for instance, when the victim suffers bodily injury due to a traffic 
accident caused by the first damaging party and then dies due to medical malprac-
tice by the treating physician ( second damaging party ).
</p>
<p>a.  Uniformity theory
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Adequacy theory
According to the adequacy theory, the first question is whether each of the dam-
aging parties created a legally adequate condition for the ultimate result to occur,  
namely the death of the victim. It is material in this respect whether each of the 
acts by itself made the occurrence of the result appear highly probable198.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Protective purpose of the duty
According to the view that takes the protective purpose of the duty as its premise, 
the issue is whether the first damaging party was also under a duty to avoid the re-
sult that the victim would be brought to a medical facility as a result of the traffic 
accident and die as a result of medical error there. According to the Learned-Hand 
formula, a crucial element is assessing whether the probability of the result hap-
pening ( death of the victim ) is particularly high as a result of the first damaging 
party&rsquo;s act, ie liability in such case hinges on which medical treatment is necessi-
tated by such a traffic accident and how high the resulting probability is that the 
victim die.

</p>
<p>b.  Distinction between primary and consequential harm &ndash; 
wrongfulness aspect
</p>
<p>According to the doctrine of the wrongfulness connection, on the other hand, 
the only issue in relation to the consequential harm is whether a special danger 
brought about by the primary harm has manifested; by contrast, the presence of 
intention or negligence is not material in relation to the consequential harm199.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Creation of a special danger
The primary harm ( bodily injury to the victim ) brought about by the first damag-
ing party created a special danger, namely that of a medical intervention, ie an act 
that is per se dangerous as it represents interference with the body.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Realisation of the special danger
(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Basic&emsp;rule
</p>
<p>The injury due to the medical error realises a danger inherent to medical treat-
ment. Therefore, the consequential harm, namely the death of the victim, can also 
be imputed to the first damaging party.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Exception
</p>
<p>However, if the consequential harm as a result of the medical error is due to inten-
tion or gross negligence on the part of the second damaging party, this does not 
constitute the realisation of the special danger created by the first damaging party. 
Hence, the consequential harm, ie the death of the victim, cannot be imputed to 
the first damaging party in this case.
</p>
<p>2.  Damage inflicted by victim himself
</p>
<p>The second group consists of cases in which the consequential harm is brought 
about by the conduct of the victim himself or otherwise by something falling 
within his sphere of responsibility, for instance in that he inflicts a bodily injury 
or other harm upon himself. A further example: the victim remains disabled as a 
result of the traffic accident caused by the damaging party and consequently falls 
ill with depression, ultimately leading to his suicide.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>a.  Uniformity theory
(  1  )   Adequacy theory
</p>
<p>According to the adequacy theory, the question is whether the conduct of the dam-
aging party represents a legally relevant condition for the result to occur, this be-
ing the death of the victim. The material issue in respect of adequacy is the degree 
of probability that someone who ( 1 ) without any contributory fault is injured in an 
accident, consequently ( 2 ) falls ill with accident neurosis, which develops into ( 3 ) 
a depression and ultimately leads to ( 4 ) suicide200.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Protective purpose of the duty
According to the view that takes the extent of the duty as its premise, the ques-
tion is whether it is also possible to impose upon the damaging party a duty to 
avoid the results that the victim falls ill with depression due to the traffic accident 
and commits suicide. According to the Hand  formula, the really material factor 
is whether the probability of the relevant result occurring, ie the victim dying, is 
particularly high due to the damaging party&rsquo;s act. This corresponds to the above-
numbered factors ( 1 ) to ( 4 ).
</p>
<p>b.  Distinction between primary and consequential harm &ndash; 
wrongfulness aspect
</p>
<p>According to the Germanic law theory of the connection with wrongfulness 
( Lehre  vom  Rechtwidrigkeitszusammenhang ),  on the other hand, it is sufficient  
that the primary harm was culpable and the only remaining question is whether 
the special danger created by the first damaging party was realised201.

The act of the damaging party, ie the mistake made by such when driving his ve-
hicle which injured the victim, gave rise to a special danger that the victim would 
suffer from accident neurosis due to his disability.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Realisation of the special danger
Furthermore, the issue is whether the victim&rsquo;s suicide represents a realisation of 
the special danger of the victim falling ill with accident neurosis due to the dis-
ability. In this respect too, it is ultimately the above-numbered factors ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) 
that are material.

<p>B.  Consequential harm in relation to another &ndash; indirect victim
</p>
<p>It is also conceivable, however, that someone other than the victim of the primary 
harm is affected by the consequential harm. In this case, the question is whether 
when a third party suffers consequential harm resulting from the first damage 
that the direct victim suffers due to the damaging party, this third party ( the in-
direct victim ) can seek compensation from the damaging party202. In this context, 
two types of case must be distinguished.
</p>
<p>1.  Damage inflicted upon near relatives
</p>
<p>The first cases are those in which the relevant third party is a close relative of the 
victim. Within this context, two sub-groups must be distinguished.
</p>
<p>a.  Takeover of the damage
</p>
<p>Firstly, it is conceivable that a third party bears the loss the victim sustained and 
indemnifies the victim. This happens, for example, when close relatives ( eg guard-
ians ) pay the medical costs for the victim.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Victim&rsquo;s compensation claim
In this case, the damage sustained is the medical treatment costs that the victim 
normally would have had to pay except that a close relative has taken them on for 
him. This means that the direct victim has a claim for compensation against the 
damaging party203.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Close relative&rsquo;s claim for compensation
In general, a close relative who has paid in lieu of the victim will be granted a claim 
for compensation against the damaging party204. Nevertheless, the rationale for 
this claim is problematic.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Extent&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;compensation
</p>
<p>The earlier prevailing theory proceeded on the basis that the damaging party had 
committed a tort against the victim and took as its premise whether the loss sus-
tained by the close relative fell within the scope of the recoverable damage. Ac-
cording to the adequacy theory, the crux is whether it might be expected that due

ment costs.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Subrogation&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;party&emsp;paying&emsp;compensation
</p>
<p>Nowadays, there is a lot of support for the view that the victim has a compensation 
claim against the damaging party and a close relative, who has indemnified the 
victim for the costs, can exercise this compensation claim in analogous applica-
tion of art 422 CC205 in lieu of the victim206.
</p>
<p>b.  Own damage
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the infringement of the direct victim&rsquo;s rights may lead to the close 
relative himself suffering damage. This is the case, for instance, when a close rela-
tive returns from abroad to care for the victim.

<p>(   1  )   Uniformity theory
(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Adequacy&emsp;theory
</p>
<p>According to the adequacy theory, the question is whether the occurrence of the 
result ( return of the close relative from abroad to care for the victim ) is adequate 
given the act of the damaging party or the injury to the victim ( bodily injury to the 
victim due to the damaging party&rsquo;s mistake when driving ) from a general perspec-
tive207.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Protective&emsp;purpose&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;duty
</p>
<p>According to the view that takes the protective purpose of the duty as its premise, it 
must be analysed whether the damaging party ought to have foreseen the damage 
to the close relative and thus, whether he was under a duty to avoid such damage208.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Distinction between primary harm and consequential harm &ndash;

</p>
<p>According to the theory of wrongfulness, on the other hand, the question is 
whether the impairment suffered by the close relative represents the realisation of 
an especial danger created by the first injury to the victim209.
</p>
<p>205 Art 422 CC stipulates: &raquo; If an obligee receives the full value of any thing or right which is the 
subject of the claim as the compensation for damage, the obligor shall be subrogated to the

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Creation&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;special&emsp;danger
An especial danger was created by the damaging party&rsquo;s act ( bodily injury to the 
victim due to the damaging party&rsquo;s mistake when driving ), specifically that the 
victim now needs care.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Realisation&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;special&emsp;danger
The question is whether the fact that the close relative&rsquo;s return from abroad to 
care for the victim became inevitable, ie represents a realisation of the relevant 
especial danger, namely that the victim requires such care. If this can be assumed, 
then the damaging party is liable to the relative for compensation regardless of 
whether he was at fault in relation to such.
</p>
<p>2.  Damage sustained by an entrepreneur
</p>
<p>The second case of consequential harm is when the employer&rsquo;s claim to work per-
formance from the employee is frustrated. This is the case, for instance, when the 
employee is injured by the damaging party in a traffic accident and consequently 
cannot perform his work, meaning his employer then sustains a loss. In this con-
text, there is debate as to whether this should be regarded as a problem related to 
the protective scope ( extent of compensation ) of the infringement of the rights of 
the direct victim or as an indirect infringement of the rights of the employer.
</p>
<p>a.  Protective scope
</p>
<p>Predominantly, the problem is seen as consisting in which damage sustained due 
to the tort by the direct victim must be compensated, provided that the rights of 
the direct victim were infringed.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Uniformity theory
(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Adequacy&emsp;theory
</p>
<p>According to the adequacy theory, this can be resolved as follows.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Basic	rule
As the occurrence of the damage ( loss of business profit by the indirect victim ) is 
not generally foreseeable on the basis of the damaging party&rsquo;s act ( bodily injury 
to the victim due to the damaging party&rsquo;s mistake when driving ), there is no ad-
equate causal link.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Exception
If the indirect and direct victims constitute an economic unit, however, then it is 
possible to draw an adequate causal link between the damaging act to the direct 
victim and the damage suffered by the indirect victim210.

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Protective&emsp;purpose&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;duty
According to the view that takes the protective purpose of the duty as its premise, 
the question to examine is whether the damage sustained by the indirect victim is 
covered by the extent of the duty211.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Basic	rule
</p>
<p>Ordinarily it is not foreseeable that the direct victim is employed by the indirect 
victim and that the indirect victim sustains a loss when the direct victim cannot 
perform his work. Therefore, there is no duty on the damaging party to foresee the 
damage to the indirect victim and avoid it and accordingly, there is no liability to 
compensate this damage either.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Exception
If, however, the direct and indirect victims constitute an economic unit, then the 
indirect victim&rsquo;s claim for compensation is in truth the claim of the direct victim. 
Therefore, regardless of the outward form of the legal personality, the indirect vic-
tim must be granted the right to assert a compensation claim.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Distinction between primary and consequential harm &ndash; 
consequential harm
</p>
<p>According to the Germanic law theory of the connection with wrongfulness ( Lehre 
vom Rechtwidrigkeitszusammenhang ), the question is whether the consequential 
infringement of the indirect victim&rsquo;s rights represents the realisation of an espe-
cial danger created by the primary injury to the direct victim.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Primary&emsp;injury&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;direct&emsp;victim
</p>
<p>An impairment of the indirect victim&rsquo;s assets cannot be seen as the realisation of 
especial danger created by the primary harm ( bodily injury ) to the direct victim. 
The bodily injury to the direct victim does not typically go hand in hand with dam-
age for the employer of the direct victim.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Primary&emsp;injury&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;indirect&emsp;victim
</p>
<p>The first question with respect to the indirect victim is, therefore, whether the in-
fringment of the indirect victim&rsquo;s assets constitutes a separate tort, also to be re-
garded in its own right as primary harm.

</p>
<p>b.  Party with standing to claim
</p>
<p>However, there is also widespread support for the view that considers it necessary 
to examine whether the indirect victim is not entitled himself to assert a claim 
for compensation due to the interference with his own rights212. According to this 
view, intention or negligence on the part of the damaging party is necessary with 
respect to the infringement of the indirect victim&rsquo;s rights.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Basic rule
As the damaging party only infringes the rights of the direct victim, as a rule 
he cannot foresee the existence of the indirect victim in this respect nor, conse-
quently, the existence of a claim by the indirect victim. Therefore, in relation to 
the indirect victim&rsquo;s rights infringement, it is not possible to assume there was 
intention or negligence on the part of the damaging party, meaning that in princi-
ple there is no liability for compensation. This is based on the following grounds.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Entrepreneurial&emsp;risk
</p>
<p>Firstly, there is very generally a risk that an employee may not be able to work after 
an accident so that in essence the indirect victim must himself provide for such 
circumstance.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Requirement&emsp;of&emsp;foreseeability
</p>
<p>Secondly, it would be an excessive limitation of the damaging party&rsquo;s freedom of 
action if liability was imposed even for non-foreseeable damage.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Exception
If the direct and indirect victims constitute an economic unit, then the damaging 
action to the direct victim can be equated to that vis-&agrave;-vis the indirect victim.

<p>Part 8 The compensation of the damage
</p>
<p>I.  Type of compensation
A.  Damages
</p>
<p>The legal consequence for a tort is, in principle, the award of compensation 
( art 709 CC ).
</p>
<p>1.  Principle of damages
</p>
<p>Compensation should in principle be made in money, ie the damage must be 
quantified in money and this amount of money is to be paid as compensation 
( art 722 para 1 in combination with art 417 CC ). The underlying idea is that it is 
possible and, moreover, convenient to compensate damage by monetary payment.
</p>
<p>2.  Types of damages
</p>
<p>Two types of monetary compensation are conceivable.
</p>
<p>a.  Compensation by lump-sum payment
</p>
<p>One possibility is to pay the whole amount of compensation in the form of a one-
time payment as a lump sum.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Advantages
In general, this method entails the following advantages: firstly, the legal dispute 
can be resolved once and for all. Secondly, the victim receives certain compensa-
tion, regardless of still indeterminable future developments. Thirdly, the need for 
money can be satisfied directly after the damage has occurred.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Disadvantages
However, this method does involve the following disadvantages too: firstly, it is 
not possible to respond if future, as yet undetermined, events develop in an un-
foreseen manner. Secondly, there is the danger that a large one-off payment leads 
the victim into spending it wastefully and not utilising it for his further life plan-
ning. Thirdly, the damaging party may run into financial difficulties if he has to 
pay a large sum of money all at once.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>b.  Compensation by periodic payment
</p>
<p>Another possible option is to pay the compensation in regular intervals on an on-
going basis.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Advantages
In general, this method entails the following advantages: firstly, it facilitates a re-
sponse to future, as yet still undetermined, factors. Secondly, it secures the exist-
ence of the victim or bereaved dependents in the long-term. Thirdly, this method 
is also feasible for a damaging party that does not have the financial means to 
make a large one-off payment.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Disadvantages
However, this method also involves the following disadvantages: firstly, there is a 
risk that the payments, which fall due over an extended period of time, ultimately 
will not be made if the damaging party&rsquo;s financial situation deteriorates, it is no 
longer known where he lives or he is no longer willing to pay. Secondly, there may 
be complications when collecting on the claim if the damaging party moves or 
there is a case of succession. Thirdly, it may place the parties in a psychologically 
stressful situation since their relationship to each other is maintained over a long 
period of time.
</p>
<p>c.  Court practice
</p>
<p>In court practice, the situation is as follows.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Principle of one-off payment
In the vast majority of cases, a one-off lump-sum payment is awarded and only sel-
dom is an annuity awarded213.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Binding submissions by parties
Furthermore, according to the case law, no annuity payment can be awarded if the 
parties apply for a lump-sum payment214.
</p>
<p>213 In the decision of the Imperial Court of 16. 9. 1916, Minroku 22, 1796, an annuity was awarded by 
way of exception.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>d.  Approaches taken in civil procedural law
</p>
<p>The Code of Civil Procedure ( CCP )215 recognises the payment of an annuity as one 
possible form of compensation and balances out some of the above-mentioned 
disadvantages in its provisions.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Changes in circumstances
If major changes arise after the end of the oral hearing in the circumstances on 
which the assessment of damages was based in the context of a binding legal deci-
sion on the awarding of compensation in the form of an annuity for the damage 
that arose by the end of the oral hearing, for instance with respect to the gravity of 
the consequential ill-health or the amount of the salary, then it is possible to file a 
claim to have the judgment changed ( art 117 para 1 sent 1 CCP ).
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Securing the fulfilment of the claim
The issue of how to ensure that the damaging party will meet his obligations as to 
paying an annuity in the future remains unresolved in the CCP too.
</p>
<p>B.  Restitution in kind
</p>
<p>Besides compensation in money, it is also conceivable that the state brought about 
by the legal infringement be remedied and the state previous to the infringement 
restored.
</p>
<p>1.  Basic rule
</p>
<p>Under Japanese law, however, compensation of damage is in principle restricted 
to monetary payments. Basically, there is only restitution in kind when it comes 
to in rem claims or unjust enrichment actions.
</p>
<p>2. Exception
</p>
<p>The CC makes an exception to this rule when it provides for restitution in kind 
when it comes to injury to the victim&rsquo;s reputation and honour. According to art 723 
CC, a court may if so petitioned by the victim order the party who has injured the 
reputation and honour of another to take suitable measures to restore such repu-
tation and honour, in lieu of compensation in money or in addition to such.

<p>II.  Assessment of damages
</p>
<p>A.  Assessment method
</p>
<p>Two different methods of assessing the damages are conceivable.
</p>
<p>1.  Cumulation of the individual heads of damage
</p>
<p>One method is to determine which heads of damage there are and the extent of 
the harm sustained under each individual head of damage ( eg costs of treatment, 
hospital charges, loss of profit ) and to add this up to ascertain the total damage.
</p>
<p>2.  Comprehensive assessment of damage
</p>
<p>Another method is to evaluate all facts of damage comprehensively and thus cal-
culate the total damage.
</p>
<p>B.  Circumstances to be considered when assessing the damage
</p>
<p>1.  Actual changes to income and expenditure
</p>
<p>Depending on whether the actual changes in the victim&rsquo;s income and expenditure 
are taken into account or not, two different approaches to assessing damage may 
be taken.
</p>
<p>a.  Concrete assessment of damage
</p>
<p>Firstly, the damage can be calculated in accordance with the actual changes that 
occurred to the victim&rsquo;s income and expenditure. This conforms with the method 
of accumulating the individual heads of damage.
</p>
<p>b.  Abstract assessment of damage
</p>
<p>Secondly, on the other hand, it is also possible to extrapolate from the actual 
changes that ensued to the income and expenditure and to calculate the damage 
based on the market value.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Comprehensive assessment of damage
When damage is assessed comprehensively, the damage is calculated based on the 
&raquo; market value &laquo;, for example, of the values or interests infringed by a bodily injury.

</p>
<p>The negative damage consists in the reduction of the average income due to the 
bodily injury sustained.
</p>
<p>2.  Taking the victim&rsquo;s individual features into account
</p>
<p>Furthermore, depending on whether the individual features of the victim are 
taken into account, the following two assessment methods can be distinguished.
</p>
<p>a.  Individual assessment
</p>
<p>One method consists in determining the damage according to the actual individ-
ual traits of the victim.
</p>
<p>b.  Standard-rate abstract assessment
</p>
<p>Another method extrapolates from the individual traits of the specific victim in 
order to determine the damage in the form of a standard amount. In this respect, 
fixed sums are stipulated in advance for different categories of injuries and the 
damage is determined according to which category the victim&rsquo;s injury matches.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Standardisation theory
According to the supporters of the standardisation theory, the value of human life 
and the human body is to be evaluated in standard rates insofar as death or bodily 
injury are concerned216.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Road traffic accidents in practice
In practice, standard rates are determined for very typical accidents, such as road 
traffic accidents, along with guidelines for the evaluation217.

<p>III.  Reduction of compensation
</p>
<p>A.  Mitigation of damages by benefits received ( Vorteilsausgleich )
</p>
<p>1.  Concept
</p>
<p>If the victim also obtains a benefit due to the tort, this benefit must be deducted 
from the amount of damage; this is referred to as mitigation of damages by ben-
efits received.
</p>
<p>2.  Rationale
</p>
<p>The rationale behind the mitigation of damages by benefits received is controver-
sial.
</p>
<p>a.  Difference method ( Differenzmethode )
</p>
<p>Firstly, mitigation of damages by benefits received can be rationalised based on 
the difference method, according to which it is self-evident that the benefit be de-
ducted218.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Grounds
The difference method is based on the idea that when the victim&rsquo;s assets have 
been diminished, the damage sustained is regarded as the sum by which they have 
been diminished. If there are benefits as well as losses to the victim, the actual 
damage is determined by adding up losses and benefits.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Problem
However, if the assessment is limited to a simple mathematical computation, 
then the victim would also have to set off benefits that he obtained due to inherit-
ance or donations.
</p>
<p>b.  Principle of the ban on enrichment
</p>
<p>Nowadays, however, it is argued above all that mitigation of damages by benefits 
received is based on the ban on enrichment. According to this standpoint, the vic-
tim should be returned to his earlier state by compensation but not draw any ben-

</p>
<p>efit exceeding such from the tort. Thus, setting off the benefit must be regarded as 
an offshoot of the ban on enrichment, which in turn is inferred from the delictual 
law principle of restitution219.
</p>
<p>3.  Which benefits ?
</p>
<p>The debate centres on which benefits are subject to the principle of mitigation of 
damages by benefits received.
</p>
<p>a.  Difference method
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Basic concept
According to the difference method, the scope of benefits mitigating the damages 
is also to be determined by the adequacy theory. Consequently, benefits with an 
adequate causal link to the damaging act are to be offset220.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Problem
However, the problem is that it is unclear what is to be regarded as adequate in 
this respect.
</p>
<p>b.  Ban on enrichment
</p>
<p>According to the doctrine of the ban on enrichment, on the other hand, it is nec-
essary to examine how the original state can be restored and what benefit would 
exceed this and thus be inadmissible. In this respect, it is material whether ob-
taining the benefit and compensating the damage are reconcilable with each 
other; this is often referred to as a question of the &raquo; similar nature of benefit and 
damage &laquo;221.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Negative interest
If the victim is freed from expenditures due to the tort and if he would gain a ben-
efit exceeding the restoration of his earlier state if he was compensated ( for loss of 
profit ) unless the fact that these expenditures have been rendered unnecessary is 
taken into account, then this benefit must be offset. In this context, it is decisive

is admissible.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Positive interest
If the victim gained income due to the tort and if he would gain a benefit ex-
ceeding the restoration of his earlier state if he was compensated without taking 
this into account, then such benefits must be offset. In this context, it is decisive 
whether the incomes are aimed at balancing the damage ( joint purpose of indem-
nification ).
</p>
<p>B.  Contributory fault
</p>
<p>1.  Overview
</p>
<p>Article 722 para 2 CC stipulates that when determining the amount of compensa-
tion, the court may take into account whether the victim is also at fault in respect 
of the damage.
</p>
<p>a.  Consideration of fault
</p>
<p>(  1  )   Discretion as to whether to consider fault
If there was fault on the part of the victim, it is within the judge&rsquo;s discretion 
whether or not to take this contributory fault into consideration and, if so, how 
much this will reduce the compensation222.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Consideration ex officio
If the court determines on the basis of the documents submitted during the pro-
ceeding that there was contributory fault of the victim, it must ex officio take such 
into account regardless of whether there are submissions in this respect by the 
party liable to compensate223.
</p>
<p>b.  Reduction of compensation award
</p>
<p>According to art 722 para 2 CC, the judge can merely reduce the amount of com-
pensation but not wholly reject liability. This is clear from the different wording of 
the provision on failure to perform. Art 418 CC states: &raquo; If the obligee is negligent 
regarding the failure of performance of the obligation, the court shall determine 
the liability for damages and the amount thereof by taking such elements into

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>consideration &laquo;. Nonetheless, it is questionable whether there is any objective rea-
son for this differentiation.
</p>
<p>2.  Significance of the victim&rsquo;s &raquo; fault &laquo;
</p>
<p>There is controversy as to the exact meaning of negligence in the sense of art 722 
para 2 CC. This is closely connected to the basic problem of how contributory fault 
is to be classified in relation to how liability arises.
</p>
<p>a.  Re-shifting of the damage back to the victim
</p>
<p>The vastly predominant opinion considers that contributory fault is a legal con-
struct that shifts the damage arising from the tort, which in principle the damag-
ing party must compensate, back to the &raquo; culpable &laquo; victim, in proportion to the 
contributory fault of such victim.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Classification of contributory fault
Contributory fault is accordingly to be classified as follows.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Tort&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;imputation&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;damaging&emsp;party
</p>
<p>If the prerequisites for delictual liability ( intentional and / or negligent infringe-
ment of a right and causation ) are met, the damaging party is liable to compen-
sate the damage. This shifts the damage, which in fact the owner of the rights ( the 
victim ) would have had to bear, to the damaging party.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Contributory&emsp;fault&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;imputation&emsp;back&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;victim
</p>
<p>Insofar, however, as &raquo; fault &laquo; on the part of the victim has contributed, the victim 
can be required to bear this proportion of the damage. Hence, on the basis of 
contributory fault, damage that firstly is shifted to the damaging party is then im-
puted back to the victim.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Justification for shifting damage back to victim
The problem is how to rationalise this re-shifting of the damage back to the victim.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;True&emsp;fault
On the one hand, it is argued that the principle of fault is applicable here too and 
the victim must be held liable for the damage based on his fault224.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Significance	of	&raquo; fault &laquo;
</p>
<p>&raquo; Fault &laquo; is understood in the same manner here as the fault that must be found on 
the part of the damaging party under art 709 CC.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Victim&rsquo;s	capacity	to	commit	delicts
</p>
<p>It is a prerequisite that the victim, like the damaging party, has the capacity to 
commit delicts225.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Not&emsp;true&emsp;fault
</p>
<p>Nowadays, however, the predominant view is that the fault principle is not di-
rectly applicable in case of contributory fault; instead, it is considered necessary 
to adapt it.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Lack	of	due	care
</p>
<p>According to prevailing opinion, contributory fault is not about recognising the 
victim&rsquo;s liability but about reducing compensation for reasons of fairness. Accord-
ingly, no fault on the part of the victim in the conventional sense is necessary; 
rather it is sufficient that there is some blameworthiness which makes reducing 
the damages for fairness considerations appear appropriate226.
</p>
<p>aaa.  Meaning of &raquo; fault &laquo;
</p>
<p>According to this interpretation, &raquo; fault &laquo; means no more or less than simple lack 
of care.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Victim&rsquo;s capacity to commit delicts
</p>
<p>This does not necessarily mean that the victim must have the capacity to commit 
delicts, ie have the ability to recognise that his conduct involves liability; it is suf-
ficient that his reasoning ability is such that he would be able to apply the care 
necessary to avoid the damage ( this corresponds to the reasoning ability of a child 
of about six years old ).
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Duty	to	mitigate	damage
Another view that certainly also holds influence contends that the rule on contrib-
utory fault is based on the duty to mitigate damage. While the injuring party may 
not infringe the rights of another person, the owner of the relevant rights, on the 
other hand, is not prohibited from injuring his own rights since he may dispose

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>of such as he sees fit. Nonetheless, since delictual liability is about shifting dam-
age from one party to another, namely the injuring party, the victim is definitely 
under obligation to avoid the damage or reduce it in order not to further burden 
the tortfeasor227.
</p>
<p>aaa.  Meaning of &raquo; fault &laquo;
</p>
<p>According to this view, fault thus means that the victim does not fulfil the expecta-
tions placed in him to the effect that he will act so as to avoid or reduce the dam-
age228.
</p>
<p>bbb.  Victim&rsquo;s capacity to commit delicts
</p>
<p>This requires a reasoning ability on the part of the victim, limited, however, to a 
requirement that he must be able to apply the care necessary to avoid the dam-
age. In this case, this means that he must have the ability to recognise that he is 
at risk and must also have the abilities that admit of an expectation that he avoid 
or reduce the damage229.
</p>
<p>b.  Limitation of the scope of the injuring party&rsquo;s liability
</p>
<p>According to another view, there is no re-shifting of the liability but instead the 
injuring party&rsquo;s liability does not extend in the first place to that part which can 
be ascribed to the victim&rsquo;s &raquo; fault &laquo;; therefore, the victim&rsquo;s powers of reasoning are 
immaterial. Two rationales for this view are conceivable.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Rationale based on causation
One possible argument is that the scope of liability is determined according to 
whether and to what extent there is a causal link between the injuring party&rsquo;s con-
duct and the occurrence of the result.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Partial&emsp;(&emsp;apportionable&emsp;)&emsp;causation
In the event that several causes for the damage compete, this view assumes that 
each cause of damage influenced the overall damage due to its respective causal 
effect, but each were only partially causal in relation to the overall damage, so that 
the scope of liability must also be restricted to this extent. Therefore, according to 
this view, contributory fault means nothing more or less than that not only the in-
juring party&rsquo;s conduct but also that of the victim constitutes a partial cause for the

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>overall damage and the scope of the injuring party&rsquo;s liability must be determined 
in line with his share in causation230.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Criticism
</p>
<p>However, this interpretation of causation gives rise to the following problems231.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Interpretation	of	causation
</p>
<p>Since according to both scientific and popular observation, every result can be 
traced to myriad causes, legal causation is assessed using the conditio sine qua 
non formula in most legal systems. However, if the respective share in causation 
is taken as the basis, this conflicts with precisely such understanding of causation. 
Besides this, it is also impossible to determine such shares objectively on the basis 
of evidence submitted.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Legal	evaluation
</p>
<p>Furthermore, this view leaves it unclear why the scope of legal liability should be 
determined on the basis of the actual causality.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Rationale based on wrongfulness
Another view seeks to found the limited liability of the injuring party not in causa-
tion but on the degree of wrongfulness on the part of the same.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Reduction&emsp;of&emsp;wrongfulness
</p>
<p>Some see this as a reduction of the wrongfulness of the injuring party&rsquo;s conduct 
due to the victim&rsquo;s &raquo; fault &laquo;232. When it comes to contributory fault, the issue is the 
assessment of what the injuring party was under obligation to do given the cir-
cumstances created by the victim and to what extent he in fact failed to do it, ie 
the injuring party&rsquo;s liability is determined according to the degree of wrongfulness.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Balancing&emsp;of&emsp;both&emsp;parties&rsquo;&emsp;wrongfulness
</p>
<p>Others again, however, see this issue as balancing the wrongfulness of the injur-
ing party against that of the victim, in order to arrive at the scope of the injuring 
party&rsquo;s liability233.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Balancing
</p>
<p>The underlying idea is that when both parties infringe a duty of conduct regard-
ing the same legally protected interests of the victim, both parties&rsquo; wrongfulness 
must be &raquo; balanced &laquo; against each other, thus reducing the wrongfulness for which 
the injuring party is accountable234.
</p>
<p>aaa.  On the part of the injuring party
</p>
<p>On the part of the injuring party, there is infringement of a conduct duty to not 
injure the victim&rsquo;s legal goods.
</p>
<p>bbb.  On the part of the victim
</p>
<p>On the part of the victim, there is also an infringement of a conduct duty insofar 
as he has not averted the risk he is subject to, although he could be expected to 
do so.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Justification	for	why	the	victim	should	bear	damage	&ndash;	principle	
of	responsibility	for	own	sphere
</p>
<p>The reduction of the injuring party&rsquo;s wrongfulness is based in this case on the 
idea that the victim must himself bear damage that arises from his own sphere235.
</p>
<p>C.  Extension of contributory fault &ndash; victim&rsquo;s predisposition
</p>
<p>If physical or psychological characteristics or an illness of the victim constitute 
a cause for the occurrence or aggravation of the damage, the question is whether 
this should be considered as a ground for reducing the amount of compensation.
</p>
<p>1.  Affirmation that predispositions of the victim should be 
considered
</p>
<p>According to case law, any predisposition of the victim that has contributed to 
the occurrence or aggravation of the damage will be taken into consideration in 
analogous application of art 722 para 2 CC when determining the compensation, 
insofar as it must be deemed unfair to impose the full burden of the damage upon 
the injuring party236.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>a.  Predispositions to be considered
</p>
<p>In this respect, the question is which predispositions of the victim must be con-
sidered.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Psychological factors
The consideration of psychological factors has been established237.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Physical factors
With respect to physical factors, the following two cases must be distinguished.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Illness
</p>
<p>If the victim suffers from an illness, this must be taken into account in line with 
its type and severity238.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Unusual&emsp;physical&emsp;characteristics
</p>
<p>However, when the issue is deviations from average body stature or normal con-
stitution, such as do not amount to any illness, these are to be considered as fol-
lows239.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Basic	rule
</p>
<p>In principle, such factors are not to be taken into account. Body stature and con-
stitution are not the same for all individuals and so it must be seen as a matter of 
course that there are more unusual manifestations within the bounds of individ-
ual differences. It is not possible to reduce the compensation on this basis.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Exception
By way of exception, such may be considered if someone has unusual physical 
characteristics that depart substantially from the average values for ordinary peo-
ple, and he has not been more careful than ordinary people despite the risk of a 
grave injury.
</p>
<p>b.  Justification for taking this into account
</p>
<p>However, it is questionable how taking such predispositions into account leads 
to fairer distribution of damage. The following two approaches seek to explain it.

</p>
<p>(   1  )   Reduction of compensation in line with the contribution 
towards the damage
</p>
<p>One view seeks to explain this as a consideration of the predisposition&rsquo;s contribu-
tion towards the damage.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Basic&emsp;concept
</p>
<p>According to this, the injuring party must only bear the damage to the extent that 
his damaging conduct has contributed to the occurrence of the result in ques-
tion240.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; Criticism
</p>
<p>The following is raised as criticism of this idea.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Interpretation	of	causation
</p>
<p>With respect to causation, there are the problems already mentioned above.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Impossibility	of	restriction	with	respect	to	the	characteristic	
being	taken	into	consideration
</p>
<p>According to this view, any and all unusual physical features that have contributed 
to the damaging result must be taken into account.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Theory of sphere of influence or responsibility
According to another view, the problem can be resolved by application of the the-
ory of sphere of influence or responsibility.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Justification&emsp;of&emsp;why&emsp;the&emsp;victim&emsp;should&emsp;bear&emsp;the&emsp;damage&emsp;&ndash;&emsp;
theory&emsp;of&emsp;sphere&emsp;of&emsp;influence&emsp;or&emsp;responsibility
</p>
<p>As the predisposition belongs to the sphere of the victim, it is such who must bear 
this risk as well241.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Possibility&emsp;of&emsp;restriction&emsp;with&emsp;respect&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;predisposition&emsp;

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>aa.	 	General	risk
</p>
<p>If a general risk of life manifests, then the injuring party who has caused this by 
culpable conduct, must bear all consequences.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Special	risks
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a risk that must not be expected in social life manifests, 
the victim must only bear the consequences when such arise from his own legal 
sphere.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;iii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Problem
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is difficult to assess what qualifies as a general risk of life242.
</p>
<p>2.  Negation that predispositions of the victim should be considered
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is also an influential view to the effect that a predisposition on 
the part of the victim that has contributed to the occurrence or aggravation of the 
damage may not be considered as a ground to reduce the amount of compensa-
tion243.
</p>
<p>a.  Rationale
</p>
<p>This is reasoned as follows.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Predisposition took effect due to injuring party&rsquo;s tort
In the absence of the injuring party&rsquo;s tort, the predisposition would not have 
taken effect and the damage would not have occurred in the first place or been 
aggravated244.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Unjustified that the victim bear the damage
However, it would no longer be relevant whose conduct brought the risk inherent 
in the predisposition into effect if such is assigned to the victim. This view there-
fore also takes special grounds as its basis to argue that it is unjust to assign the 
risk to the victim.

ment of 29. 10. 1996 ], Minsh&ocirc;-h&ocirc; Zasshi 117&ndash;1 ( 1997 ) 100, seeks to base the argument on whether 
a predisposition goes beyond the scope of simple individual differences.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Excessive&emsp;restriction&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;victim&rsquo;s&emsp;freedom
When predispositions are taken into account, there is a danger that the freedom 
of action of those who have such predispositions is restricted and their participa-
tion in social life made more difficult because they are under a greater obligation 
to avoid being a victim of a tort.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Concept&emsp;of&emsp;social&emsp;solidarity
</p>
<p>Furthermore, consideration of the predisposition is imperative, just as is the ca-
pacity to commit delicts, on the basis of the concept of social solidarity.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Capacity	to	commit	delicts
</p>
<p>In order to enable even those without the capacity to commit delicts to take part 
in public life, the victim must accept damage by those incapable of committing 
delicts as inevitable and bear it himself.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Victim&rsquo;s	predisposition
</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, the party who engaged in the damaging conduct must bear 
the increased risk of the damage occurring and being aggravated due to the victim 
having a special predisposition, in order to facilitate the person who has such a 
predisposition taking part in social life.
</p>
<p>b.  Consideration within the framework of contributory fault
</p>
<p>If there has been a violation of the duty to mitigate damage on the part of the vic-
tim, then there is usually contributory fault. If it is reasonable to expect the victim 
to recognise his predisposition and to be in control of it and if consequently, he 
would have been able to control his own conduct accordingly, then failure to do so 
must be counted against him and thus the compensation reduced.
</p>
<p>D.  Reduction of the duty to compensate
</p>
<p>In Japanese law, there is no provision on reducing the duty to compensate out of 
equity considerations. Neither does academic literature or case law refer to neces-
sity for such a provision. This could be because no grave problems arise in this re-
spect since it is possible to be freed from liability under Japanese insolvency law 
( art 248 ff Bankruptcy Law )245.

<p>Part 9 Prescription of compensation claims
</p>
<p>Article 724 CC states: &raquo; The right to demand compensation for damage in tort shall 
be extinguished by the operation of prescription if it is not exercised by the vic-
tim or his / her legal representative within three years from the time when he / she 
comes to know of the damage and identity of the perpetrator. The same shall ap-
ply when twenty years have elapsed from the time of the tortious act. &laquo;.

</p>
<p>A.  The significance of the short prescription period
</p>
<p>1.  The nature of the short prescription period
</p>
<p>a.  Prescription of claims
</p>
<p>The general prescription period for claims is ten years ( art 167 para 1 CC ), begin-
ning from the point in time when the right may be asserted ( art 166 para 1 CC ).
</p>
<p>b.  Short prescription period for compensation claims arising out of 
tort
</p>
<p>By contrast, art 724 sent 1 CC may be seen as a rule providing for a shorter pre-
scription period of only three years, starting to run from when there is knowledge 
of both the damage and damaging party.
</p>
<p>2.  Reason for the short prescription period
</p>
<p>The grounds for introducing such a short prescription period are controversial246.

<p>671Part 9&emsp; &emsp; Prescription&emsp;of&emsp;compensation&emsp;claims
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>a.  In order to avoid evidentiary difficulties
</p>
<p>According to one view, the reason for the shorter prescription period is to avoid 
difficulties when it comes to giving evidence247.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Rationale
Since torts come about unexpectedly, this view holds that it is more likely in such 
case than in the case of contractual claims that as time goes on evidence is lost 
and it becomes difficult to give evidence. The short prescription period was thus 
introduced, so the view contends, in order to prevent unfair claims and / or to avoid 
having the damaging party fall into difficulties as regards providing exculpatory 
evidence248.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Criticisms levelled
With respect to this line of argumentation, the following problems have been 
identified.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Consistency&emsp;with&emsp;the&emsp;longer&emsp;period&emsp;of&emsp;20&emsp;years&emsp;?
</p>
<p>For one thing, the argument that the shorter period is necessary to avoid eviden-
tiary difficulties cannot explain why there is still a parallel long period of 20 years 
after the tort has been committed249.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Consistency&emsp;with&emsp;respect&emsp;to&emsp;when&emsp;the&emsp;period&emsp;begins&emsp;?
</p>
<p>If, furthermore, the reason is to protect the damaging party against evidentiary 
difficulties in relation to proving he is not liable, then why does the period not 
start to run once the tort has been committed but only once the victim has knowl-
edge of damage and damaging party250 ?
</p>
<p>b.  Sense of injury subsides over time
</p>
<p>Another school of thought sees the shorter prescription period as a reflection of 
how the victim&rsquo;s sense of having been injured subsides over time251.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Rationale
Supporters of this view argue that since the sense of having been injured subsides 
over time, it would be actually preposterous to restart the dispute after this. Thus, 
when a certain period of time has elapsed since the point in time when the victim 
or his legal representative gained knowledge of the damage and damaging party, it 
may be assumed that the victim&rsquo;s feelings have also calmed down again; therefore, 
it is appropriate that the compensation claim be extinguished.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Criticism
This view is regarded as problematic in the following ways.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Relationship&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;reason&emsp;for&emsp;the&emsp;claim&emsp;arising
</p>
<p>Firstly, it is generally recognised that the compensation claim itself arises com-
pletely independently of the knowledge and the feelings of the victim. Therefore, 
neither can the fact that the knowledge or the feelings of the victim have dimin-
ished alone serve as a justification for extinguishing it252.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Conflict&emsp;with&emsp;the&emsp;purpose&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;law&emsp;of&emsp;torts
</p>
<p>Justifying prescription simply by reference to the feelings of the victim is, further-
more, irreconcilable with the main purpose of the law of torts, which is namely to 
compensate the loss suffered253.
</p>
<p>c.  Safeguarding the expectations of the party liable to pay 
compensation
</p>
<p>A third view sees the reason for the shorter prescription period as being to protect 
the expectations of the party liable to pay compensation254.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Rationale
According to this view, it can be taken for granted that the liable party ( damaging 
party ) expects that the party entitled to compensation ( victim ) has forgiven him 
or will not assert his claim if such does not assert his entitlement within a reason-
able amount of time. If the entitled party suddenly seeks compensation after a 
long period during which he raised no claim, the expectations of the liable party

<p>673Part 9&emsp; &emsp; Prescription&emsp;of&emsp;compensation&emsp;claims
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>will be disappointed; this would be inadmissible, argue supporters of this view, 
hence the prescription period is shortened.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Criticism
In criticism of this view, it is argued that it is not a legitimate expectation if the 
liable party, who after all committed the tort and thus caused the damage, relies 
on the victim having forgiven him merely because such has not yet exercised his 
right255.
</p>
<p>B.  Commencement of the prescription period
</p>
<p>The short prescription period begins at the point in time when the victim or his 
legal representative gains knowledge of the damage and damaging party.
</p>
<p>1.  Significance
</p>
<p>The underlying idea is that the prescription period should only start to run from 
the time when it becomes possible to assert the compensation claim, since prior to 
this, it is not possible to assume that the entitled party is merely failing to assert his 
right. Only when damage has resulted from a tort and the damaging party has been 
identified, is it possible for him to assert a compensation claim against the damag-
ing party and thus, the prescription period should only start to run at this point.
</p>
<p>2.  Knowledge of the tort
</p>
<p>Accordingly, it is a prerequisite that the victim or his legal successor gains knowl-
edge of the tort256. For as long as he has no knowledge of the tort, he cannot assert 
any compensation claim.
</p>
<p>3.  Knowledge of the damaging party
</p>
<p>Further, it is necessary that the victims have knowledge of the damaging party. 
&raquo; Damaging party &laquo; in this context means the party who is obliged to compensate.
</p>
<p>4.  Knowledge of the damage
</p>
<p>Finally, the victim must also have knowledge of the damage.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>a.  Significance
</p>
<p>The point in time at which the victim gains knowledge of the damage means in 
this context the time at which the victim gained sufficient knowledge to seek com-
pensation of the damage from the damaging party, and was also actually in a po-
sition to do so257.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   What must the victim know ?
It is sufficient that the victim has knowledge of the fact of damage having oc-
curred; knowledge of the extent and nature of the damage is not necessary258.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Scope of knowledge
It is controversial whether the victim must really have knowledge of the damage 
having arisen. According to the case law, the prescription period only starts to 
run when the victim really has knowledge of the damage having arisen259. This is 
based on the following considerations.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Expectation&emsp;that&emsp;claim&emsp;will&emsp;be&emsp;asserted
</p>
<p>If the victim really has no knowledge of the damage having arisen, neither can he 
be expected to assert the claim against the damaging party.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Need&emsp;to&emsp;protect&emsp;the&emsp;victim
</p>
<p>Furthermore, if it was sufficient merely that the occurrence of the damage be iden-
tifiable, this would mean that the victim would have to research whether damage 
has arisen. However, it would not be justifiable to impose such a burden on the 
party who has suffered damage due to a tort.
</p>
<p>b.  Ongoing tort
</p>
<p>If the tort continues in time, the question of when the prescription period com-
mences arises anew. In this respect, two types of damage must be distinguished260.

<p>675Part 9&emsp; &emsp; Prescription&emsp;of&emsp;compensation&emsp;claims
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Continuing infliction of damage
One type is when the ongoing damage can be separated into parts, for example in 
the case of unlawful possession of a piece of land or when sunlight is blocked. In 
such case, it is possible to set out claims for the individual parts of damage sepa-
rately, so that every day a new compensation claim arises, with its own prescrip-
tion period starting respectively at the time the damage became known261.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Cumulative damage
Another form of damage is when the ongoing, damaging act results in an accu-
mulation of impairments, all of which must be seen as one, uniform injury, such 
as health injury due to environmental pollution, eg by noise, vibrations ( oscil-
lations ), air pollution or water pollution. In such case, a single, comprehensive 
claim for compensation arises, so that prescription starts to run at the time the 
continued damaging act ends or the time when the victim dies262.
</p>
<p>c.  Secondary diseases
</p>
<p>If the victim continues to suffer from a secondary disease subsequent to bodily in-
jury due to a tort or if such arises, the question of when prescription begins to run 
is posed. In this respect, the following two types of cases must be distinguished.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Continuing secondary disease
The first type of case is when the secondary disease continues from the time of the 
injury due to the tort and also after a considerable time has passed without im-
provement. In this case, the time of the diagnosis that the diseased state has con-
solidated is considered to be the point in time that the victim gained knowledge 
of the damage. At this point the victim in fact knows the secondary disease exists 
and thus has sufficient knowledge of the damage occurring to be able to assert a 
compensation claim against the damaging party263.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Later onset secondary disease
The second case is when a secondary disease emerges newly after a considerable 
time has passed subsequent to the injury due to the tort.

</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Unity&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;disease
If this damage forms a single category with the damage that arose earlier from the 
tort and if it was even then foreseeable, then it is not to be regarded as separate 
damage. In such case, the prescription period consequently begins to run when 
the victim gains knowledge of the first aspect of the damage to emerge264.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Separate&emsp;secondary&emsp;disease
</p>
<p>If the secondary disease is not foreseeable when the first damage arises, however, 
this is separate damage.
</p>
<p>aa.	 	Basic	rule
</p>
<p>According to case law, the victim gains knowledge of the damage as soon as the 
secondary disease is manifest, so that the prescription period starts to run then265. 
When the secondary disease becomes manifest, the damage resulting from such 
becomes foreseeable and the victim is thus in a position to assert a compensation 
claim; therefore, the prescription period starts to run at this point in time.
</p>
<p>bb.	 	Exception
</p>
<p>However, if methods of treatment become necessary that could not normally have 
been foreseen at the time of the injury or when the secondary disease arose and 
if such result in expenses, the prescription period in respect of such costs neces-
sary for the treatment does not start to run until the victim has received this treat-
ment266. In this case too, it cannot be expected that the victim assert the compen-
sation claim until the actual treatment.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>a.  Problem issue
</p>
<p>Depending on whether it is taken to be a prescription period or a cut-off period, 
the following differences are relevant.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Prescription period
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Interruption
</p>
<p>If it is a prescription period, it is possible for the prescription to be interrupted.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Invoking&emsp;the&emsp;defence&emsp;of&emsp;prescription
</p>
<p>The parties may invoke the defence of prescription. However, if there is a violation 
of good faith or an abuse of a right, it may be that this defence is not recognised.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Cut-off period
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Interruption
</p>
<p>In the case of a limitation period, no interruption of the period is possible.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Invoking&emsp;cut-off&emsp;period&emsp;as&emsp;a&emsp;defence
</p>
<p>Further, there is no question of having to assert the fact of limitation since the 
right is automatically extinguished with the expiry of the cut-off period.
</p>
<p>b.  Prescription
</p>
<p>In academic writing, there is an influential school of thought to the effect that the 
long period under art 724 sent 2 CC is a prescription period. This is based on the 
following ideas267.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Wording of the provision
Article 724 sent 1 CC refers expressly to &raquo; prescription &laquo; of the claim. In sent 2 it stip-
ulates &raquo; the same shall apply &laquo;. Therefore, according to this view, sent 2 must clearly 
also refer to a prescription period.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   How it emerged
During the drafting of the CC, a prescription period of 20 years was set out in re-
lation to all rights with the exception of ownership rights. The long period in the 
previous version of art 724 CC was based on the analogous application of this pro-

the Supreme Court of 21. 12. 1989 see under FN 269 ) is also based on these ideas.

</p>
<p>vision. This also shows that the 20 year period was the standard period set for pre-
scription268.
</p>
<p>c.  Cut-off period
</p>
<p>Case law, on the other hand, regards the long period stipulated in art 724 sent 2 CC 
as a cut-off period269.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Reasons
This is for the following reasons.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Purpose&emsp;of&emsp;art&emsp;724&emsp;CC
</p>
<p>Since the three year prescription period under art 724 sent 1 CC takes as its prem-
ise the time when the victim was aware of both damage and damaging party, it 
does not start to run as long as the victim has no knowledge of such. The purpose 
of art 724 sent 2 CC is, therefore, to serve the end of rapidly achieving comprehen-
sive clarification of the legal relations connected with a tort after 20 years have ex-
pired from the time of the tort.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;No&emsp;requirement&emsp;that&emsp;it&emsp;be&emsp;raised
</p>
<p>This aim would mean that the compensation claim arising from the tort must be 
extinguished regardless of whether this is raised by the parties after 20 years have 
passed.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Criticism
This standpoint taken by case law comes in for heavy criticism, however270. The 
most important points of criticism are the following three.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;i&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Doubt&emsp;as&emsp;to&emsp;the&emsp;necessity&emsp;for&emsp;fast,&emsp;comprehensive&emsp;
clarification
</p>
<p>The first criticism concerns the assumption that the purpose of art 724 CC is to 
obtain rapid, comprehensive clarification of the legal relations. For at least with 
respect to the long period of 20 years it is hardly possible to see the purpose of the 
provision as lying in rapid clarification of the legal relations.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;ii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Possibility&emsp;of&emsp;interruption
Secondly, it is pointed out that there must necessarily be a possibility to inter-
rupt the period. As a rule, there is no problem in this context since when there is 
a ground for interruption, the three year period is also interrupted. However, if 
the 20 year period is seen as a cut-off period, then the right is extinguished after 
20 years, even if the three year period has meantime been interrupted by the claim 
being recognised.
</p>
<p>(&emsp;&emsp;iii&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;)&emsp; &emsp;Violation&emsp;of&emsp;good&emsp;faith&emsp;as&emsp;well&emsp;as&emsp;abuse&emsp;of&emsp;a&emsp;right
</p>
<p>Thirdly, assuming the long period to be a limitation period may give rise to prob-
lems with respect to violations of good faith as well as abuse of rights. In the case 
of a cut-off period, the parties cannot assert such but it is certainly possible to 
submit that the cut-off period has expired. It is conceivable that art 724 CC be in-
terpreted to the effect that an extinguishment of the right due to the expiry of the 
cut-off period offends against good faith and thus may not be recognised. There 
is no reason to exclude such a possibility, especially as there is already doubt as 
to the necessity for rapid and comprehensive clarification of the legal relations271.
</p>
<p>2.  Possibility of suspending the period
</p>
<p>a.  Problems
</p>
<p>If the owner of a right is hindered from engaging in an action that would interrupt 
the prescription period, then there is no prescription even if the period expires; 
instead it only expires when this obstacle disappears and a certain period of time 
has elapsed thereafter ( arts 158&ndash;161 CC ). However, it is questionable whether such 
a suspension applies to cut-off periods as well.
</p>
<p>b.  Rejection of suspension
</p>
<p>According to this view, there cannot be any suspension of a cut-off period as such 
comprehensively limits the period during which a right may be exercised.
</p>
<p>c.  Advocation of suspension
</p>
<p>Case law, on the other hand, proceeds on the premise that suspension is possible 
even with respect to limitation periods272. This is based on the following reasons.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Impossibility of exercise of right
The exercise of the right would no longer be allowed simply because 20 years had 
elapsed although the victim was not able to exercise the right.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Unjustified relief of the damaging party&rsquo;s position
Moreover, it would be a crass violation of the principle of justice if the damaging 
party, who provided the cause for the victim not being able to exercise his right, 
should be freed from liability for the damage by the expiry of 20 years.
</p>
<p>(   3  )   Equivalence with prescription
Just as in the case of prescription, therefore, the victim must be protected so that 
a limitation of the effects of art 724 sent 2 CC serves the requirements of justice.
</p>
<p>B.  Commencement of the long period
</p>
<p>The long period begins at the time the tort was committed. It is nonetheless con-
troversial what exactly this means.
</p>
<p>1.  Time of the damaging act
</p>
<p>If the wording of the provision is taken as a premise, then &raquo; the time of the tortious 
act &laquo; is the point in time at which the damaging act is committed273.
</p>
<p>2.  Time the damage occurred
</p>
<p>Case law, however, sees the beginning as being the time when all or part of the 
damage occurred if the damage occurred after the expiry of a reasonable length of 
time once the damaging act was ended274.
</p>
<p>a.  Examples
</p>
<p>This becomes relevant, firstly, when damage is caused by harmful substances that 
are stored in the body, and secondly, in cases in which the damage caused by an 
illness only emerges after a certain incubation period.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>b.  Rationale
</p>
<p>This is argued as follows.
</p>
<p>(   1  )   Impossibility of exercising the right
If in such cases the period was allowed to expire possibly even before the damage 
has occurred, this might mean that the victim is thus prevented from exercising 
his right although he in fact was at no point able to do so.
</p>
<p>(   2  )   Foreseeability from the perspective of the damaging party
Furthermore, the damaging party must assume that in view of the type of damage 
that he has caused by his acts, the victim will only seek compensation after a rea-
sonable period of time has passed.

<p>  Preliminary remarks
</p>
<p>In the Preface of &raquo; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Germanic Perspective &laquo; I ex-
plained that the comprehensive responses of the representatives of other legal 
systems will be instrumental in the draft of my conclusions on the overall study. 
I further pointed out that the conclusions would seek to provide substantial an-
swers founded on comparative research to the fundamental questions of tort law 
and in so doing &ndash; besides encouraging fruitful worldwide discussions &ndash; make an 
attempt to guide future developments in European tort law.
</p>
<p>Guidance may be given to national legislators, courts and scholars1 but in par-
ticular to the European Union in the hope of supporting its process of harmonisa-
tion &ndash; or even unification &ndash; of European tort law. This raises the previous question 
of whether we need such harmonisation and if harmonisation of European tort 
law can really happen. The statements by the representatives of other national le-
gal systems also gave some interesting insights which may be relevant in answer-
ing such queries. It is therefore expedient to go into these questions in detail and 
in so doing to demonstrate the relevance of this project.

<p>I.  Necessity of harmonising European tort law ?2
</p>
<p>The call for harmonisation of private law and thus, among other areas, also tort 
law is often heard and several groups of scholars have already worked on design-
ing future tort law as part of an entire code3 or as a separate draft4. However per-
haps the question on the tip of your tongues is whether harmonisation is really 
a necessity or at least whether it brings advantages5. Doubts in this respect seem 
reasonable when looking at the USA: it is a state and not only a more or less loose 
community of national states like the EU; nevertheless, 50 different legal systems 
exist in the USA. But one has to take into account that the legal systems of the EU 
Member States vary a great deal more than the legal systems of the states in the 
USA. There exists not only a fundamental difference between the common law in 
England and Ireland on the one hand and the Continental civil law on the other 
but also divergences between the civil law systems, eg in respect of the notion of 
fault or wrongfulness, strict liability and vicarious liability, recoverable non-pecu-
niary loss and time limitations. The Member States have been independent coun-
tries for centuries and, therefore, their legal cultures &ndash; although originally partly 
based on Roman law6 &ndash; pursue different paths. This is true, of course, with regard 
to the &raquo; legal families &laquo; eg, the Germanic, the Scandinavian and the Romance fami-
lies. But even between the legal systems of the German-speaking countries, there 
are decisive differences.
</p>
<p>Bearing this in mind, the main justification for harmonisation seems under-
standable, namely that the differences between the legal systems are hindering 
commercial  cross-border  transactions  in Europe7: entrepreneurs who offer their 
goods or services in other Member States are disadvantaged in comparison with 
competitors who are active solely on a domestic basis. Specifically, whereas the

</p>
<p>domestic providers must simply gain information about the legal frameworks in 
their own country, the foreign provider is forced to find out about a legal system 
divergent from his own domestic law and to comply with such. This gives rise to 
transaction costs, which can prove to be obstacles to the market, especially for 
small and medium-sized businesses. The varying strictness of liability rules may, 
moreover, not only render access to the market more difficult but also have the 
effect of distorting competition as the liability rules in the land of origin will in-
fluence the calculation of costs. Less commercial areas &ndash; such as the liability of 
parents for their children or of those who keep animals &ndash; do not lead to direct dis-
tortion of competition. Nonetheless, these aspects also affect the single market 
indirectly via the liability insurance system.
</p>
<p>However, even in cases solely involving the law of damages, the differences be-
tween the legal systems play an important role in everyday life. Let us take as an ex-
ample a traffic accident that occurs near the border between Austria and Germany, 
involving two married couples, one Belgian and one German. Both drivers are in-
jured and their respective spouses are killed. It may be of crucial interest whether 
the accident site was on the Austrian or German side of the border as in principle 
the law of the country where the accident took place is applicable8 and the prereq-
uisites for compensation claims as well as the contents and extent of such depend 
on the applicable law. This may be crucial because &ndash; as will be looked at below 
( no 8 / 266 ) &ndash; some legal systems do not provide for a no-fault based and thus strict 
liability for motor vehicles and furthermore differences exist not only with respect 
to the maximum compensation sums but also in relation to what constitutes re-
coverable damage. The claims for compensation provided for in national legal sys-
tems with respect to pecuniary damage arising from bodily injury or death, such as 
medical expenses, loss of earnings and other consequential losses but also and in-
deed to a greater extent the injured party&rsquo;s or bereaved party&rsquo;s claims for compen-
sation of non-pecuniary harm, vary greatly9. In many European states ( eg Austria, 
Belgium, France ), people who lose a close relative in a traffic accident have a sepa-
rate claim for compensation of pain and suffering directed at the compensation 
of the pain caused by said relative&rsquo;s death; this is independent of any health im-
pediment the bereaved person themselves may have suffered ( eg shock on hearing 
about the death ). In several other EU Member States ( eg Germany and the Nether-
lands ), on the other hand, no such compensation for pain and suffering is recog-
nised for such relatives. This may lead to very different amounts of compensation 
for pain and suffering for a victim&rsquo;s own injury but also to a bereaved victim being

<p>awarded compensation for the loss of a spouse that he would never have received 
at home or, vice versa, that a compensation claim cannot be asserted though it 
would have been a matter of course in the victim&rsquo;s domestic system.
</p>
<p>It is not only in such everyday scenarios such as traffic accidents that the dif-
ferences between the legal systems are so noticeable, however: the intensifica-
tion of financial, work and private contacts within the EU means it is increasingly 
common that inhabitants or companies in one Member State are subjected to the 
rules of another Member State because they stay there, work there or &ndash; acting from 
their own state &ndash; &raquo; are active there &laquo;, whether by delivering goods, because of assets 
or mass media. The assessment of an injury according to another legal system 
may lead in many ways to unanticipated legal consequences since &ndash; as indicated in 
the reports on the different legal systems &ndash; there are considerable differences with 
respect to the prerequisites for claims and the legal consequences thereof, which 
may derive not only from fundamentally different value judgements in the law of 
damages but also from differences in the interaction between tort law and other 
rules, such as insurance and social welfare law.
</p>
<p>As the question of applicable law is thus always of considerable importance in 
cases of damage involving another country, the frequent differences of opinion 
on the international private law connection often pose an obstacle to an amicable 
resolution of disputes and thus cause considerable legal costs. Harmonisation of 
European liability law could thus lead to a noticeable reduction of legal disputes 
and thus the consequential expenses of cases involving damage that have an in-
ternational aspect. Last but not least, European citizens &ndash; who are encouraged to 
move around in the European Union &ndash; cannot be expected to be very understand-
ing that, in the case of an accident, they are treated very differently depending on 
which legal system is applicable.
</p>
<p>Bearing in mind all the negative aspects associated with international cases of 
damage due to the many different legal systems involved, it is natural to dream of 
a uniform law in the EU10. At present this is certainly still a dream which, however,

<p>at least seems partly feasible, in particular for the law of contract11 and possibly 
also for the law of damages12. Nonetheless, the question of whether this is a happy 
dream or a nightmare is still open.
</p>
<p>II.  Today&rsquo;s state of affairs
</p>
<p>The European Union already advances the unification, or at least a harmonisation, 
of private law of the Member States, namely by way of directives and regulations. 
This is the case not only in the area of contract law13 but also to some extent of tort 
law; the most important example in the latter area is the directive on product li-
ability14.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the  decisions  of the Court of Justice of the European Union 
( CJEU ) contribute to harmonisation and sometimes create completely new rules &ndash; 
acting like a legislator. The most sensational example is the development of state 
liability: consumers, for example, have a claim against the state if it does not cor-
rectly implement EU directives which have a protective purpose in respect of con-
sumers and a consumer suffers a loss therefrom. As a result, the state is liable 
even for the legislative acts of the parliament &ndash; a liability which was previously al-
most unknown in the Member States15.
</p>
<p>Last but not least, in the last years academics and judges have contributed in a 
less obvious way to the harmonisation of European private law16.
</p>
<p>Therefore, as realists we have to accept that the question is no longer whether 
we want harmonisation of law in the EU since it is already a fact which cannot be 
denied and we must come to terms with this development. Thus, what is on the

<p>agenda is not whether there should be a harmonisation of the law, but rather how 
harmonisation should take place17.
</p>
<p>As to the quality of harmonisation, it must be said that in seeking to strike a 
balance, the European Union&rsquo;s attempts to harmonise private law have unfortu-
nately produced extemely negative results: the respective directives or regulations 
of the EU cover narrowly defined areas18. Such selective harmonisation leads how-
ever to a double shattering of the law19: firstly, the national legal systems become 
infiltrated by foreign provisions; secondly, the EU&rsquo;s directives and regulations are 
not based on a consistent and overall concept and therefore are very often not in 
accordance with one another. Every directive of the European Union is a compro-
mise between the varying national views and the outcome depends on national 
interests as well as the nationality and personality of the members of the Com-
mission and the opinion of which legal system gets the upper hand over the other 
legal systems. All this is done without taking regard of a consistent overall system, 
which does not exist but would be imperative in order to aim at a legal system 
realising the idea of equal treatment and thus of justice. These isolated forays, 
highly unsuitable for harmonising legal systems, were probably fostered by the 
influence of common law under which one is accustomed to deciding from case to 
case, without taking into account other cases adequately in advance and thus also 
without even thinking of a coherent overall system20. The introductory remarks by 
Green / Cardi21 are characteristic of this way of thinking: &raquo; While courts thus &rsaquo;make 
law&lsaquo;, they do so by way of decisions in individual cases that then are applied in 
subsequent cases. Courts must decide only the issues presented by the facts of 
the case before them and, in doing so, they do not engage in the sort of general 
and prospective lawmaking in which legislatures engage. Thus, while a court may 
decide to reject contributory negligence and employ instead comparative negli-
gence, it would not then attend to the many consequential issues that must be ad-
dressed once a regime of comparative negligence is adopted. Those matters would 
be left to future development as they arise in cases and are presented to courts. &laquo;

do not have much in common on a conceptual level and are solely created to provide remedies 
for an effective functioning of the Community in isolated areas.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>If not only the courts should proceed by way of deciding individual cases but also 
the legislature takes a corresponding approach, it will be difficult to attain a con-
sistent and thus fair overall system, in particular if this involves the harmonisa-
tion of legal systems with different legal cultures and divergent solutions as re-
gards fundamental questions.
</p>
<p>This criticism can be illustrated easily and objectively by the directive on prod-
uct liability, the most important existing example of harmonisation in the area of 
tort law. This directive imposes a very rigorous strict liability regime on entrepre-
neurs for damage caused by defective products. But the reasons for establishing 
such liability are uncertain and it is open to debate whether this provision fits into 
an overall plan which takes regard of the whole area of liability of entrepreneurs. 
For example, why is liability for services not included and what about the relation-
ship with other types of strict liability ? Further: is it really reasonable that strict 
liability is provided for a carpenter if a stepladder breaks, as the ladder he made 
is a moveable good, but that an entrepreneur is not strictly liable if the bridge he 
designed collapses, as the bridge is not a moveable good ?
</p>
<p>Besides in the area of directives and regulations, the lack of a basic concept 
can also be observed in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Com-
munity. An impressive example in tort law is the jurisprudence on Member States&rsquo; 
liability for a violation of EU Community law22. The CJEU established a liability 
which resembles result-oriented liability which is independent of any misbehav-
iour of the state. As mentioned earlier, such liability is new to the legal systems of 
nearly all the Member States. Moreover, the Court has very strange opinions with 
regard to causation, which do not fit in with the approaches of most of the na-
tional legal systems in respect of this issue.
</p>
<p>Further, it must be pointed out that not only those who design the EU&rsquo;s direc-
tives and regulations, but also the CJEU, have a deplorable lack of knowledge of 
fundamental functions, prerequisites, aims and legal consequences of the indi-
vidual legal instruments and also of their interplay. In this connection, the aware-
ness of the necessity that certain requirements have to be appropriately linked to 
certain  legal consequences appears to be diminishing. For example: according to 
Directive 2007 / 64 / EC on payment services, the payer&rsquo;s payment service provider 
has to refund to the payer the amount of a non-executed payment transaction in 
the case of liability ( art 75 ). Although the wording gives the impression that the 
issue at stake is liability under the law of damages, astonishingly enough, fault

</p>
<p>is not a requirement. Ultimately, this could be justified because in substance the 
provider&rsquo;s obligation is one under the law of unjust enrichment. However, if one 
accepts this, it seems quite unreasonable that art 78 rules that no liability at all 
exists in the case of abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the pro-
vider&rsquo;s control. Such grounds for exemptions are acceptable if compensation of 
imputable damage under tort law or under contractual liability rules is at stake 
but not under the law of unjust enrichment: irrespective of the reasons for non-
execution, there is no justification at all for granting the provider the amount he 
should have transferred.
</p>
<p>Another example is set by the CJEU: after the recent judgment in the case Gebr. 
Weber and Putz, the consumer&rsquo;s warranty claims independent of fault in cases of 
defective goods being delivered also cover the costs of disassembly of the defec-
tive item and assembly of the item delivered in replacement; other consequential 
loss sustained by the purchaser resulting from the defectiveness are, however, not 
covered by the warranty in the eyes of the CJEU. Since the costs of the disassem-
bly of the defective item and the assembly of the replacement item are no longer 
part of the performance within the equivalence relationship, it is already wrong 
in principle to allow such costs to be covered by warranty rights as these are di-
rected at bringing about the balance desired by the parties between performance 
and counter-performance23. The issue is not the rendering of the promised perfor-
mance itself but who bears the consequential costs that first arise due to the de-
fective performance and therefore there is no sufficient reason to impose the bur-
den of such costs on the trader without considering any grounds for imputation, 
in particular fault. It must be emphasised that granting a no-fault based claim for 
compensation of the costs of disassembly and assembly, ie of the damage conse-
quential to defectiveness, gravely flouts a fundamental concern of our legal sys-
tem, specifically that legal consequences and the prerequisites thereof in terms 
of factual elements of the infringement must be proportionate: this is one of the 
prerequisites for a consistent overall system that complies with the principle of 
equal treatment and thus the fundamental concept of justice24. The case law of 
the CJEU also leads to a contradiction in value judgements, irreconcilable in that 
it only provides for no-fault based liability in respect of disassembly and assembly 
costs but not for all other losses consequential to defectiveness, for example, the 
disadvantages that arise before the defect is remedied due to the goods delivered 
or the thing in which the defective good is installed being unusable. No persuasive 
arguments can be found to support distinguishing between different types of loss 
consequential to defectiveness, resulting in serious disadvantages.

<p>In addition to all these deficiencies, it must be stressed that quite often the 
quality of the respective directives or regulations and also the judgments25  is de-
plorable, as some of the individual provisions are not based on a convincing idea, 
and their concept is not understandable. This can once again be shown by the di-
rective on product liability. The reasons given for this directive point out that en-
trepreneurs&rsquo; liability must cover only defective goods which have been produced 
industrially. The idea behind this was that industrial mass production causes a 
special danger, namely the unavoidable risk of delivering defective products; it is 
the problem of the so-called &raquo; Ausreisser &laquo; or &raquo; runaways &laquo;. Even with utmost care it 
is not possible to produce only flawless goods or at least to withdraw all defective 
products from circulation. However, this idea would not justify establishing liabil-
ity for defects caused by the products&rsquo; design. But what is even worse, the final 
version of the directive does not take any regard of the above-mentioned reason 
given for strict liability and also includes defective products of craftsmen, land-
lords, farmers and artists. It seems highly problematic that a great part of the di-
rective&rsquo;s provisions are in clear conflict with the only valid reason behind it which 
was explicitly stated at the beginning of the drafting process. Also, the lawmaker 
has never even attempted to justify the extended application of strict liability and 
it seems difficult to find any convincing arguments in favour of such broad and 
very strict liability &ndash; at least nobody has been able to come up with any.
</p>
<p>All these shortcomings mean that the European legal systems are drifting 
away from a well thought-out, consistent system which follows the idea of equal 
treatment. Pierre Widmer26 therefore rightly diagnosed that, in the area of tort law, 
the EU provisions are even more inconsistent than the national provisions and 
that there is no recognisable overall concept. As a result, Community tort law is a 
mere torso. Thus, the legal systems correspond less and less with the fundamental 
idea of justice, namely the principle of equal treatment.
</p>
<p>III.  How to proceed ?
</p>
<p>Of course, quite a significant number of the deficiencies could be avoided by tak-
ing more time and more care in designing directives as well as regulations and in 
drafting judgments. But there can be no doubt that unification and harmonisa-

<p>tion are awkward and run beyond this into fundamental difficulties27: national 
legal systems are part of the traditional culture of the respective countries and 
determine the social life in that country. A general European codification, or even 
the unification or harmonisation of some areas, could be a far-reaching break 
from tradition, although &ndash; as mentioned before &ndash; parts of the European legal sys-
tems, especially the law of obligations, are influenced by Roman law and thus 
correspond to some extent. Further, as many European legal systems developed 
independently from one another over centuries, largely diverging legal cultures 
and habitual ways of thinking have to be reconciled. Therefore, it will be time-
consuming, strenuous, hard and to some extent frustrating to strive towards the 
goal of a general consistent concept for the harmonisation of European private law, 
something which is urgently needed as every community needs a fair and func-
tioning legal system. Nevertheless, one should not condemn the EU as a whole or 
only complain about the situation and the difficulties, but try to improve the EU, 
to influence the harmonisation process and to overcome the hurdles. Therefore, 
the decisive question is how we can improve the quality of harmonisation of the 
legal systems of the Member States.
</p>
<p>I am convinced that we can reach the goal of reasonable harmonisation or 
unification of tort law in the EU only by drawing up as a first step a new and con-
sistent concept which is acceptable to all or at least to nearly all of the Member 
States28. Fortunately, as already mentioned, two working groups have already de-
signed such tort law concepts; the European Group on Tort Law &ndash; which published 
its Principles of European Tort Law in 200529 &ndash; and the Study Group on a Euro-
pean Civil Code together with the Research Group on Existing EC Private Law ( Ac-
quis Group ) &ndash; which designed a Draft Common Frame of Reference, presented to 
the public in 200830. Although a highly important step forward has been made by 
drafting these concepts, it still seems necessary to address some basic questions 
of tort law in addition. When drafting the first concepts, it is of course not pos-
sible to discuss all the fundamental questions in desirable profundity. Neverthe-
less, there is a need to do this, as it is the fundamentals that ground the decisive

<p>differences between juridical orders, and therefore a comprehensive review of the 
foundations of tort systems is required.
</p>
<p>I am convinced that the aim of harmonisation will be attainable only by fur-
ther intensive work on a comparative basis31: first of all, we have to know even more 
about the fundamental ideas of other legal systems to better understand each 
other and to explore the different legal cultures and the ways of thinking in other 
countries. By doing so we will recognise the common bases, receive many valu-
able incentives, will be inspired by alternative solutions and discover new tools 
for solving problems, become more open-minded for different ideas and increase 
the understanding of fundamental perspectives; we will learn which differences in 
legal culture we have to take regard of and will know which largely diverging habit-
ual ways of thinking have to be reconciled. By these means we will also recognise 
the borderlines of acceptable harmonisation.
</p>
<p>But as to comparative law, it must be pointed out that the more different the 
foreign legal systems are, the more dangerous it is to draw inspiration from these 
systems. When I say &raquo; different &laquo; I not only refer to the differences in parts of pri-
vate law, eg tort law, or the entire private law, but also to fundamental divergences 
in the whole legal systems32, eg including the social security system or criminal 
law because they may have the greatest influence on tort law.
</p>
<p>IV.  Different legal cultures33
</p>
<p>A.  General differences of the legal systems
</p>
<p>First of all, one has to consider the differences between the English common law 
system and the Continental civil law systems: the characteristic feature of the Con-
tinental legal systems is that they are codified, in contrast to English case law. Even 
more important is that the concept of a Civil Code presupposes that the human

</p>
<p>intellect is capable of capturing the underlying structure of the law and presenting 
it in a systematic and comprehensive manner.
</p>
<p>As legal systems with both common law and codified law coexist in the Euro-
pean Union, lawmaking by the courts is juxtaposed with lawmaking by the legis-
lature. Any harmonisation or unification of law can, however, ultimately only be 
achieved via statutory regulation; thus, English law would have to change funda-
mentally. Although even in the area of common law, statutory laws are increas-
ingly frequent, above all due to EU regulations and the transposition of EU di-
rectives, this would still be a very considerable step; ie a fundamental change of 
the process of lawmaking. However, the difference would be smoothed over not 
only because even in common law systems statutory law is increasingly usual but 
above all because the law of damages in particular is a field in which judge-made 
law also plays a very important role due to the diversity of problems, technical and 
social developments and the unsatisfactory statutory bases in the Continental Eu-
ropean legal systems34.
</p>
<p>However, as mentioned earlier, there are also quite significant divergences be-
tween the &raquo; legal  families &laquo; under civil law, eg the Germanic and the Romance or 
Scandinavian, and even members within one legal family show fundamental dif-
ferences. Let us take for example two German-speaking countries: the Austrian 
and the German Codes date from different times &ndash; 1811 and 1900 respectively &ndash; and 
therefore the Austrian Code is a product of the &raquo; Age of Enlightenment &laquo; whereas 
the German Code is strongly influenced by the theory of Pandectism, which is 
based on Roman law. The basic ideas have a lasting influence on the respective 
legal systems as a whole.
</p>
<p>Also in respect of allocating the duties between the legislator and the courts 
there are significant differences not only between the common law countries &ndash; 
with the dominant role of case-law designed by the courts &ndash; and the Continental 
civil law countries, but also between the Continental civil law systems based on 
codifications. It is, for example, obvious that on the one hand the French Code 
civil, the Austrian Allgemeine B&uuml;rgerliche Gesetzbuch and also the Dutch Code 
prefer flexible general principles over detailed casuistic provisions, thus entrust-
ing the courts to apply the provisions of the law to individual cases, and on the 
other hand the German B&uuml;rgerliche Gesetzbuch tends toward strict and detailed 
rules without enough scope for development.

</p>
<p>However, I do not intend to deal in any more detail with these general char-
acteristics of culture which are well known, rather I want to embark on some dif-
ferences in legal culture which are decisive for the design and development of 
tort law.
</p>
<p>B.  The notion of tort law
</p>
<p>Even setting this goal brings us, however, to a very basic problem, namely the is-
sue of which field of law we are talking about in the first place. The meaning of the 
German word &raquo; Schadenersatzrecht &laquo; and the corresponding terms in other Conti-
nental European legal systems, on the one hand, and the usual name &raquo; law of torts &laquo; 
in the common law on the other hand, are extremely different and point to fun-
damentally different underlying concepts. This must be taken into account again 
and again in the following paragraphs35, but so much can already be said: the 
Continental laws of damages are somewhat homogenous legal areas based on the 
relevant basic prerequisites and the resulting legal consequence, namely claims 
directed at compensation for damage. In contrast, common law proceeds on the 
basis of a multitude &ndash; approximately 7036 &ndash; of individual &raquo; torts &laquo; with very different 
prerequisites but also completely different legal consequences. It is highly signifi-
cant for our purposes here that by no means all torts require that damage has oc-
curred and while &raquo; damages &laquo; are frequently provided for as a legal consequence, 
this is not always the case, as the law of torts equally well concerns claims for sur-
render of property, cease and desist injunctions and disgorgement of profits. Fi-
nally, damages too are of the most various types and by no means always directed 
at compensating damage. This applies rather only to &raquo; compensatory damages &laquo;, 
which are aimed at compensating damage, but not to restitutionary, exemplary 
or punitive, nominal or contemptuous damages. The &raquo; law of torts &laquo; is thus an ex-
tremely inhomogeneous area of law that only serves the compensation of damage 
caused to a certain extent, albeit a very great extent. Only the law of those torts 
that provide for compensatory damages thus corresponds to the law of damages 
in the German-speaking and the other Continental legal systems. Only within this 
context can parallels be drawn and ideas adopted. This does not seem to have 
been stressed enough hitherto but should be taken into account as broadly as pos-
sible in the following discussion.

</p>
<p>C.  The rule &raquo; casum sentit dominus &laquo; and the social security system
</p>
<p>A further difference in culture: I begin my book, &raquo; Basic Questions of Tort Law from 
a Germanic Perspective &laquo;37, by pointing to the rule &raquo; casum sentit dominus &laquo;, which 
derives from Roman law and expresses the idea that a person who suffers dam-
age must in principle bear this damage himself. There must be particular reasons 
to justify allowing the victim to pass the damage on to another person. Thus, the 
accent is more on corrective justice than on distributive justice. At least the same 
is true for the United Kingdom38. France, on the other hand &ndash; differing from the 
other Continental European countries &ndash; emphasises a victim-oriented approach 
in tort law,39 starting with the principle &raquo; neminem laedere &laquo;40, and thus underlines 
the idea of  distributive  justice. According to  Askeland&rsquo;s  contribution to this pro-
ject41, solutions of distributive justice also enjoy broad support in Scandinavia. It 
is thought fair that one who has suffered damage should receive compensation.
</p>
<p>These differences in tort law are less important in the area of personal injury 
because there they are levelled out largely by social security systems. This seems 
to be true for all EU Member States, at least for the German-speaking countries42 
as well as for France43, Hungary44, Poland45, the Scandinavian countries46 and the 
United Kingdom47, in contrast to the much less exhaustive American social se-
curity system. Even though the varying cultures of compensation under tort law 
are adjusted insofar by social security systems, nonetheless the differences be-
tween the individual social security systems create astonishing differences in re-
spect of tortfeasors&rsquo; liability. The extensive compensation of victims in Scandina-
via is achieved by overlapping tort law, in the area of personal injuries, to a large 
extent with rules of insurance and social security schemes; most impressive of all 
is that the legislator additionally abolished the social security institutions&rsquo; right 
of recourse48. Therefore, with respect to personal injuries, the Scandinavian legal 
systems combine far-reaching compensation of the victim with the offender&rsquo;s far-
reaching release from liability.

<p>699 &emsp; &emsp; Preliminary&emsp;remarks
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>Providing for the victim&rsquo;s extensive compensation for losses caused by per-
sonal injuries via social security systems decreases the urgency of providing com-
prehensive compensation under tort law. Therefore, the popular argument that 
the highest ranking protected interest deserves the most extensive protection by 
tort law no longer seems to hold true as another legal instrument, even easier for 
the victim to enforce, already makes sure of such protection. From the victim&rsquo;s per-
spective, in this area, intensive protection under tort law is required only as far as 
social security does not provide full compensation. Such loopholes probably do 
not concern the most important interests of the victim to the highest degree. Seen 
from the compensation aspect we, therefore, see that the conclusion that &raquo; the 
highest ranking interests deserve the highest degree of protection under tort law &laquo; 
is no longer convincing; rather, one would even have to say, in respect of the other 
protection mechanisms, that the opposite is true.
</p>
<p>Looking at the &ndash; in most countries broadly accepted &ndash; preventive effect of tort 
law49, no problem arises as long as the social security system has the right to claim 
recourse from the tortfeasor. From the offender&rsquo;s perspective there is no change if 
there is only a replacement of the creditor ( caused by shifting the claim from the 
victim to the social insurer ). But if such recourse is abolished as under Scandina-
vian law, the question arises whether other legal instruments &ndash; eg criminal law &ndash; 
have to be strengthened in order to attain the required deterrent effect.
</p>
<p>These examples show that the interplay of tort law and social security law is 
of the highest importance when designing tort law provisions. These realisations 
may be of some influence when rating the EU&rsquo;s product liability rules &ndash; the EU&rsquo;s 
main contribution to the field of tort law. As, in the case of damage to property, 
only consequential loss is covered and only if the property was used mainly for 
private purposes, personal injuries is the predominant field of application. But 
this is &ndash; as we have just learned &ndash; exactly the area where victims enjoy extensive 
protection by the social security system and no urgent need for their additional 
protection by tort law can be diagnosed. Thus, one could say that the producer&rsquo;s 
strict liability is solely an advantage for social insurers who can claim redress. But 
even this is not true under those legal systems which abolish the recourse action 
against the offender. In addition: under those legal systems any preventive effect 
of the product liability provisions is also missing. Bearing all of this in mind, the 
question as to what reasons or &ndash; in others words &ndash; which elements of liability can 
justify such rather producer&rsquo;s strict liability gain importance and one begins to 
doubt whether there was really such an urgent need to impose strict liability on 
producers.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>D.  Fault-based and strict liability
</p>
<p>Quite different legal cultures in the area of tort law itself can be recognised, eg, 
with respect to the acceptance of strict liability; this area is further interesting be-
cause of the interplay between tort law and the compulsory insurance system. In 
the area of strict liability, European legal systems show much more diversity than 
in other areas of tort law50. On the one hand, the scale begins with the very far-
reaching French strict liability of the holder of a thing, the gardien. This strict li-
ability is not based on the special dangerousness of plants or things but is inde-
pendent of such ideas. This leads to astonishing results: a four-year-old child was 
sitting in the upper floor of a house on the windowsill drawing a picture with a 
pencil on a piece of paper. Unfortunately &ndash; in looking down &ndash; the child lost its bal-
ance and fell down still with its pencil in its small hands. The child was lucky as 
it fell on a pedestrian and not on the pavement but it injured the pedestrian with 
its pencil. The French court was of the opinion that the child is the gardien of the 
pencil and therefore strictly liable for the damage caused by the pencil. Perhaps in 
the middle is Germany&rsquo;s legal system; special legislation establishes strict liability 
for the keepers of a variety of dangerous things. England is at the other end of the 
scale; the English legal system is very reluctant to recognise strict liability.
</p>
<p>The absence of any strict liability for motor vehicles is perhaps the most 
marked difference between English law and that of most European countries. The 
majority of European legal systems have introduced strict liability in this area and 
it is important to note that they have coupled their liability rules with the impo-
sition of compulsory insurance schemes as well as compensation funds. Conse-
quently, while dangers resulting from the object as such ( which can move at high 
speed and cause substantial harm ) certainly were considered by the legislators in 
those jurisdictions, an overall view supports the impression that Israel Gilead&rsquo;s fol-
lowing statement51 is true not only of Israel but also of Continental Europe: &raquo; The 
absolute liability attached to motor vehicles has been designed and actually func-
tions as a tool for channelling the burden of road accidents to insurers. &laquo; There-
fore, at least some notion of loss-spreading amongst those who profit from traffic 
seems to justify strict liability in those countries. It must be noted that, insofar as 
strict liability is concerned, a common core only exists in a very small area, eg in 
the area of nuclear energy, where international conventions exist.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>E.  Punitve damages and the aims of the law of torts
</p>
<p>A further serious difference between the common law and Continental European 
legal systems exists: common law countries, especially the USA, but also &ndash; to a 
lesser degree &ndash; England, Ireland52 and Israel53, think highly of punitive damages; 
Continental European countries reject them54. This contrast stems from a funda-
mentally different way of thinking and from a focus on different aims of the law of 
torts. As already explained above ( no 8 / 29 ), the law of torts in common law is an 
extremely heterogeneous area of law as the numerous torts cover different factual 
elements with widely varying legal consequences and by no means do they always 
serve the goal of compensation of damage caused. As a result, also in the law of 
torts, the door seems to be open to considering goals other than compensation of 
damage. From this point of view it seems to be unproblematic that common law 
legal systems underline the preventive function of tort law and allow the awarding 
of punitive damages, amounting to a multiple of the loss suffered by the victim. 
Nevertheless, such punitive damages do not comply with the idea of corrective jus-
tice, as they do not restore the plaintiff&rsquo;s loss but instead give him a windfall while 
disregarding the fundamental private law principle of bilateral justification55. Fur-
ther, by accepting punitive damages under tort law one oversteps the borderline 
between private and criminal law and thus neglects criminal law&rsquo;s fundamental 
principles, namely eg nulla poena sine lege and rules on burden of proof56.
</p>
<p>It is astonishing that most Continental European lawyers seem to feel much 
less need for punitive damages, and thus less need to violate quite a number of 
fundamental ideas, than their colleagues in the USA and England. The reasons for 
this phenomenon may be certain differences between the legal systems57. It seems 
possible that, under US law, punishment under criminal law is of less importance 
than in Continental Europe58; this may even be true to a higher degree for the area of 
administrative penalty law. Thus there may be a greater need for punitive damages

</p>
<p>in the USA than in Europe. But there are a number of other possible reasons which 
I cannot elaborate on here59.
</p>
<p>V.  Different ways of thinking
</p>
<p>When trying to harmonise European law it is necessary to consider the difficul-
ties caused by the various ways of thinking which are very different and which de-
veloped to diverse levels in the various legal families60. Illustrative examples are 
the differences between the English, French and German ways of legal thinking61, 
which can be seen when reading the country reports in this project.
</p>
<p>The fact that English private law &ndash; and thus also the law of damages &ndash; is domi-
nated by case law influences the way it is applied: English courts and other bodies 
applying the law begin with a search for decisions made on the same or at least 
similar facts in another case and focus on the decision of a single case. Continen-
tal European lawyers, on the other hand, begin with a general, abstract rule, which 
has been formulated by the legislator. The importance of this difference should 
not, however, be overestimated, as the law of damages is largely judge-made law 
after all in Continental European systems too.
</p>
<p>This is compounded by the following: in the common law, too much emphasis 
would seem to be placed on how only case-by-case decisions are to be made and no 
overall picture is to be drawn. Even a glance at the overall descriptions of the law of 
damages indicates that this is true only to a limited extent, even for decisions on 
single cases. Above all this case-by-case view is ultimately not sustainable in real-
ity if decisions are to be reached in a coherent, understandable manner and to sat-
isfy the principle of fairness to the effect that the same facts should be treated the 
same and different ones differently. In this respect the following considerations, 
which have already been described in more detail elsewhere, are relevant62: if the 
bodies applying the law, in particular the courts, must decide on a case, it is ab-

</p>
<p>solutely clear from the beginning that an earlier decision is only applicable when 
its facts are identical. Any and all deviations from the facts at issue inevitably give 
rise to the question of whether the precedent set by an earlier decision, tailored to 
the facts of that particular case, is still applicable because the material elements of 
the facts are the same and any differences consist only in non-material points; or 
whether the material elements are different but nonetheless to be seen as equiva-
lent; or whether the differences must lead to a different evaluation, ie the previous 
decision is not applicable, even by way of analogy. This determination can only 
be made in an objective, understandable way if the criteria used in the previous 
decision to arrive at the evaluation in that case are identified and it is established 
whether only immaterial elements of the facts deviate and the decision must thus 
be the same. If, however, there are differences in points which are not clearly in-
significant, it must be considered whether the case should be treated in the same 
way. This can only objectively be affirmed if it is possible to draw a more general 
rule from the evaluation made in the previous decision, which also covers the fac-
tual elements now at issue, thus admitting of an application by analogy. If this is 
not the case, differences in the facts necessitate different evaluations. If the latter 
is the case, for lack of an applicable previous decision, the only remaining option 
is to look for rules on the basis of evaluations that are more general and can be 
derived from case law as a whole, which then can be applied to the facts at issue.
</p>
<p>This shows that even in common law the elaboration of more general or even 
very general rules is inevitable if decisions are to be objectively coherent, comply 
with the principle of equal treatment and fit into a consistent overall system. The 
procedure is thus the same as in the Continental European systems, only often 
even more comprehensive as initially the more general rule must also be elabo-
rated whereas on the Continent it is available in legal codes.
</p>
<p>As the courts in the common law jurisdictions have thus far already fulfilled 
this task as a matter of course, since it is unavoidable, but not in full awareness of 
so doing, the only task is to increase awareness in this respect, to reveal this pro-
cedure openly and to develop it more comprehensively. There is no difference in 
principles, and therefore no fundamental difficulties must be feared in the con-
text of a changeover to codified law. Thus, the difference might perhaps be re-
duced to the statement that in common law the emergence of more general rules 
tends to be somewhat neglected whereas in Continental European systems on the 
other hand, there is too much focus on the general rules and the individual fea-
tures of the single case are sometimes neglected.
</p>
<p>But as already mentioned there are even astonishing differences between the 
legal systems on the Continent63: Germans tend to adopt a very systematic way of

<p>thinking and usually try to give a convincing reason for decisions at both the legisla-
tive and the judicial stages. The French legislator and the Cour de cassation almost 
never give sufficient reasons and therefore one never knows why a case is solved in 
a particular way and one never knows beforehand how the next case will be solved.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we need a consistent overall concept at the European level which 
can serve as a signpost for future directives by showing the European Union how 
directives can fit into a consistent overall system. Such a concept can further stim-
ulate national legislators in respect of the future development of their national 
legal systems and &ndash; perhaps &ndash; ultimately provide a basis for a future common Eu-
ropean tort law64. As we need such a concept, we have to overcome all difficulties; 
this will be not easy, it will require much knowledge, time and patience, openness 
for ideas we are unaccustomed to, willingness to accept compromises and last but 
not least hard work, first of all on a comparative basis. If all show good will and co-
operate in a reasonable fashion, we will reach the goal, maybe not an ideal concept 
on the first go, but at least the basis for further improvement.
</p>
<p>VI.  Method of designing the draft
</p>
<p>When designing such a concept and when drafting provisions, different ap-
proaches can be taken. The European legislators have usually applied two differ-
ent methods in this respect hitherto65: on the one hand, firm, detailed rules, and 
on the other hand, general, elastic rules which must be put into concrete terms by 
the courts66.
</p>
<p>The basic rules of tort law provide very good examples of the difference. As 
mentioned above, the German Civil Code, the B&uuml;rgerliches Gesetzbuch ( BGB ), 
clearly tends towards the first-named method of firm, detailed rules:
</p>
<p>&sect; 823 Abs 1 BGB: &raquo; Whosoever unlawfully injures, intentionally or negligently, the 
life, body, health, freedom, property or other right of another person, has an obligation 
to the other person to compensate the resulting loss. &laquo;67
</p>
<p>64 As to the different means of harmonisation and unification see Taupitz, Europ&auml;ische Privat-
rechtsvereinheitlichung heute und morgen ( 1993 ).
</p>
<p>65 As Nolan, Damage in the English Law of Negligence, JETL 2013, 260, points out, the common 
law system can be understood as a combination of these two approaches as it knows &raquo; nomi-
nate torts &laquo; and also the general principles of negligence liability.

<p>705 &emsp; &emsp; Preliminary&emsp;remarks
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>The rules in the French Code civil and the Austrian Civil Code, the ABGB, both 
of which are almost 100 years older than the BGB, on the other hand, are formu-
lated in a more general and elastic manner:
</p>
<p>Article 1382 Code civil:  &raquo; Tout  fait quelconque de  l&rsquo;homme qui cause &agrave; autrui un 
dommage, oblige celui par la faute duquel il est arriv&eacute;, &agrave; le r&eacute;parer. &laquo; ( &raquo; Any act what-
ever of man, which causes damage to another, obliges the one by whose fault it oc-
curred, to compensate it. &laquo;68 )
</p>
<p>The wording of &sect; 1295 ( 1 ) ABGB is similar: &raquo; Every person is entitled to claim com-
pensation  from  the wrongdoer  for  the damage  the  latter has  culpably  inflicted upon 
him;  the damage may have been caused by breach of a  contractual duty or  indepen-
dently of any contract &hellip; &laquo;  69.
</p>
<p>The precise list of protected goods in &sect; 823 ( 1 ) BGB contains more information 
than is covered by the very generally worded blanket clauses in art 1382 Code civil 
and &sect; 1295 ( 1 ) ABGB. However, the fact that the German legislator has ruled on far 
more details means that, due to the rigidity of the provisions, any wrong decisions 
of the legislator also have a more noticeable effect, besides which statutory rules 
are also more likely to become inappropriate due to social, technical or economic 
changes, while the indefinite scopes of the Code civil and the ABGB allow the 
courts room for manoeuvre in order to keep up with changes.
</p>
<p>Moreover, it must be noted that the German approach to formulating provi-
sions has not led to legal certainty, one example being pure economic loss. Pure eco-
nomic interests are not covered at all by &sect; 823 ( 1 ) BGB. German jurists feel that this 
is too restrictive70 and, therefore, have turned to &sect; 826 BGB, the rule on liability in 
case of behaviour contra bonos mores and have overstretched this provision. For 
example, intentional interference with contractual relations is always considered 
to be contrary to public policy; therefore, in essence contractual relations are gen-
erally protected against intentional interference. In addition, &sect; 826 BGB requires 
intent, but courts and scholars take a very broad-minded approach to the effect 
that gross negligence is equal to intent.
</p>
<p>Further, Germans also paved the way for claims on compensation for pure 
economic loss by expanding the area of contractual liability, in which context pure 
economic loss has to be compensated. Therefore, culpa in contrahendo and &raquo; posi-
tive Forderungsverletzungen &laquo; ( violation of duties of care between the parties to a 
contract, even if the contract is null and void ) have been declared to belong to the 
area of contractual liability although the relevant duties are not established by

<p>agreement of the parties. German lawyers also use conjuring tricks to try to estab-
lish &raquo; Verkehrssicherungspflichten &laquo;  71 to protect pure economic interests.
</p>
<p>It seems that German lawyers have become accustomed to all of these du-
bious manoeuvres because they have been indoctrinated since their legal child-
hood72. However, an outside observer gets a strong impression that because the 
code is so strict, our German colleagues end up trying to get around its provisions 
in rather illegal ways, by circumventing the statutes and by the famed &raquo; Flucht in 
die Generalklauseln &laquo; ( escape into the blanket clauses ) &ndash; the commentaries on the 
general clauses &sect; 242 and &sect; 826 BGB really speak volumes. Such &ndash; broadly speak-
ing &ndash; illegal proceedings are a habit-forming drug and have led German courts 
and scholars to become accustomed to ignoring fundamental value judgements 
and decisions of the legislator without any sense of shame. All of this produces an 
astonishing result: the rather generous, even sloppy, Austrians respect their code 
to a much greater degree than the orderly Germans.
</p>
<p>A lesson on legal policy ought to be drawn from this: if the legislator tries to 
restrict the courts&rsquo; room to manoeuvre to an unreasonable extent with firm, de-
tailed rules, it ultimately achieves the opposite effect and legal certainty results to 
a lesser degree than with more elastic provisions73.
</p>
<p>However, we must now take a glance at &sect; 1295 ABGB and compare its solution 
for pure economic loss with the equivalent German rule. At first sight, we see that 
this provision says nothing about the protection of pure economic interests. One 
can only infer that according to its wording it seems possible to claim compensa-
tion for pure economic loss as &sect; 1295 rules that everyone is entitled to demand 
compensation of the person who did him harm by fault. Nonetheless, the decisive 
questions as to what extent pure economic interests enjoy protection and when 
causing pure economic loss violates a duty of care are not answered.
</p>
<p>A glance at French tort law reveals how much room to manoeuvre is left by 
provisions like those of the ABGB on tort law: although the wording of the tort 
law provisions of the French Code civil is nearly the same as in those of the ABGB, 
French tort law is not only totally different from today&rsquo;s Austrian tort law, but is 
also very different from French tort law at the beginning of the 19  th century on the 
same legal bases as today.
</p>
<p>71 The construct &raquo; Verkehrssicherungspflichten &laquo; has been described by Markesinis / Unberath, The 
German Law of Torts 4 ( 2002 ) 86, as follows: &raquo; whoever by his activity or his property establishes 
in everyday life a source of potential danger which is likely to affect the interests and rights of 
others, is obliged to ensure their protection against the risks thus created by him &laquo;.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>Such open provisions already pose problems in a national legal system, but 
even more so in rules which should unify European private law, because they will 
be interpreted in the individual Member States in very different ways as legal tra-
dition in each country differs to quite some extent.
</p>
<p>I feel that a middle course would be reasonable and that, therefore, the flex-
ible system, designed by Walter Wilburg    74 on a comparative basis, can give valuable 
support75 and show how to reconcile the very different ways of drafting codes &ndash; eg 
in Germany on the one side and in France and Austria on the other side &ndash; which 
seem to be a formidable hurdle in harmonising European tort law  76.
</p>
<p>Wilburg makes two fundamental observations77: first, he recognises the plural-
ity of independent valuations and purposes inherent in large legal complexes. The 
law may thus not be understood, interpreted and applied from the perspective of 
a single guiding idea. However, this must not be allowed to lead to a discretion-
ary jurisprudence of countless unpredictable ad hoc viewpoints that may be al-
ternately observed or ignored in isolated decision-making processes. On the con-
trary: all basic guidelines inherent in a given area of the law have to be observed 
in the light of their specific interaction in certain types of cases, that is to say in 
a generalised context. Wilburg calls these independent fundamental values &raquo; ele-
ments &laquo; or &raquo; forces &laquo;; one could also say &raquo; factors &laquo; or &raquo; system-forming principles &laquo;78. 
The plurality and autonomous weight of Wilburg&rsquo;s principles clearly distinguish 
his theory from all attempts to explain and apply major areas of the law on the ba-
sis of any single fundamental idea. Such attempts always necessitate the over-em-
phasis of some basic values and purposes by means of fictional extension and the 
downgrading of others, despite their autonomous importance. Wilburg therefore 
opposes all attempts to provide monocausal explanations of tort law79 based on 
exclusive principles such as fault. This view has already become widely accepted 
today: for instance, it is recognised that besides fault, above all a high degree of 
dangerousness deriving from things or actions is of decisive importance; having

</p>
<p>said that, economic circumstances, the gaining of profit and insurability may also 
play a role80.
</p>
<p>Aside from the plurality of principles in a major area of the law, the flexible 
system emphasises their gradation;  in other words, the &raquo; comparative &laquo; character 
of the &raquo; elements &laquo;. The legal consequence in a specific case results from the com-
parative strength of the elements in their interplay. The elements thus exhibit a 
clear, multifaceted structure of &raquo; more or less &laquo;. In the case of colliding principles, 
a compromise must be found by determining priorities.
</p>
<p>It is important to point out that regard must be had not only to the gradations 
of the relevant elements in establishing a legal consequence but also the possibil-
ity of grading the legal consequences.
</p>
<p>Criticism of the flexible system is certainly justified insofar as the method 
must still be refined and the application improved. However, this criticism is very 
often also based on the misapprehension that the disciples of this system are aim-
ing at rules as flexible, uncertain and hazy as possible. However, this is not true 
at all and therefore akin to defamation. The leading scholar of the flexible system, 
Franz Bydlinski81, underlines quite a different basic idea &ndash; I quote: &raquo; Insofar as there 
are typical, clearly comprehensible facts, also as regards the consequences of a 
rule, the requirements of legal certainty and pragmatism, ie in this context pre-
dictable and simple application of law, and moreover also fairness and equality, 
support adherence to the system of fixed rules and prohibitions within the legis-
lative system. Also in cases where legal certainty is one of the particular aims of a 
law, there will be no ( or at least very little ) room for &rsaquo; flexible &lsaquo; enclaves. A basically 
flexible law on bills of exchange, real property law, procedural or punitive law is 
certainly impossible. &laquo;
</p>
<p>Due to the complexity of the problems and the variety of the facts in differ-
ent cases, it is by no means always possible to design firm rules in private law82. 
But even then Wilburg is not in favour of formulating sets of merely discretionary 
rules which can be either observed or ignored altogether in the decision-making 
process at random; on the contrary. However, the flexible system offers a middle 
course between rules with firm and strict elements and vague general clauses: by 
</p>
<p>80 Cf Koziol, Basic Questions I, no 6 / 1 ff.
81  Bydlinski, Juristische Methodenlehre und Rechtsbegriff 534.
82 This is not always adequately taken into account in criticism, for example also of PETL, see for 
</p>
<p>instance Wagner in: Koziol / Steininger, European Tort Law 2005, 666 ff. The use of very sketchy 
terms, such as &raquo; wrongfulness &laquo;, without listing relevant aspects to be weighed up against each 
other can lead in any case only to less definiteness and thus more uncertainty. Neither has any-
one managed yet to establish a clear, fixed rule on compensation of purely economic interests; 
naturally it would neither be appropriate to determine that there is simply no liability for pure 
economic damage nor that there should generally be compensation. Hence the criticism re-
mains rather unhelpful so long as it does not simultaneously manage to offer better solutions &ndash; 
which, however, has not yet been the case.

</p>
<p>describing the decisive factors which the judge has to take into consideration, the 
legislator can reach a much higher level of concretisation and considerably re-
strict the discretion of the judge. As such, the decision of the court becomes fore-
seeable and understandable on the one hand and still allows regard to be had to 
the variety of facts in different cases in a guided manner, on the other hand. The 
interplay of the different factors, which may be present in different intensities, is 
decisive for the legal consequence.
</p>
<p>One concluding remark: it is clear that the flexible system not only has spe-
cial merits as regards the development of national laws but also in particular in 
respect of harmonisation of laws as it provides an appropriate way to satisfy two 
opposing claims to the greatest extent possible, namely by not merely setting up 
blanket clauses in dire need of more specification on the one hand, or rigid rules 
on the other, that cannot do justice to the multitude of individual cases and more-
over hinder all adaptation to changed circumstances83. By stating the material fac-
tors to be taken into account by the judge, the system accomplishes a significant 
degree of specification, decisively limiting the discretion of the judge and ren-
dering the decision foreseeable but also allowing consideration of the diversity 
of possible facts in a controlled manner. Thus, the flexible system is highly suit-
able for harmonising or unifying European law, as it offers a compromise between 
the German and the French / Austrian way of designing codes and as the factors 
deemed to be material in the various legal systems may be included and account 
can be taken of the variously weighted evaluations as far as possible84.

<p>I.  The victim&rsquo;s own risk and shifting of the damage as 
well as insurance-based solutions
</p>
<p>A.  Comparative law review
In Basic Questions I ( no 1 / 1 ff ), I discussed how in the German  legal family the 
person who suffers damage must also bear the burden of such, unless there are 
special reasons that make it justifiable to facilitate shifting the damage to another 
person. However, I also pointed out that in today&rsquo;s society there is an increasing 
perception that the individual must as far as possible be freed from every risk. 
This goal certainly cannot be achieved by &ndash; however generous &ndash; extension of the 
law of damages, as freeing someone from risk always requires &ndash; albeit sometimes 
very far-stretching &ndash; grounds for imputation which can justify shifting the bur-
den of the damage from the victim to someone else. In the case of personal injury, 
however, social security systems have taken over the risks in a very extensive fash-
ion independently of any grounds for imputation. The costs of these systems are 
by no means borne in full by the insured beneficiaries but to a large extent by the 
state and by employers. These social benefits, however, generally do not change 
the imputation of the damage under the law of damages as the social insurance 
institutions have rights of recourse against liable parties; there are, nonetheless, 
exceptions to this possibility of recourse under workers&rsquo; accident insurance laws 
when it comes to slight negligence on the part of the employer causing damage to 
the employee; such exceptions are supported above all by the argument that the 
employer fully or partly pays his employees&rsquo; social security contributions85. It is 
also noteworthy that the very emphatic efforts made towards the most extensive 
coverage of damage that has already been sustained seems to be the primary fo-
cus, although it would obviously make sense for a main goal of the overall legal 
system to be the hindrance of damage occurring in the first place.
</p>
<p>In Hungarian law, the starting point is also that in principle the victim must 
bear his damage himself; nonetheless the situation in Hungary as described by

</p>
<p>Menyh&aacute;rd displays the same tendency towards expanding liability for damage86. 
One difference to the German legal family presented, however, is the stronger fo-
cus on the notion of preventing damage alongside the compensation principle. 
The social benefits that apply in the health area, like those in the German legal 
family, do not displace the law of damages since the tortfeasor&rsquo;s liability is main-
tained in the form of the social insurance body&rsquo;s right of recourse.
</p>
<p>In relation to Japanese law too, the established starting point is that everyone 
must bear the burden of damage sustained due to his own behaviour or by chance 
himself87. Liability is extended here &ndash; as in many legal systems &ndash; by wide-ranging 
objectification of fault88. The damaging party is not relieved of liability by social 
security benefits here either as the insurers have rights of recourse against the 
responsible party, except against negligent employers since such pay insurance 
premiums89.
</p>
<p>Neither does Oliphant90 express any doubt that all legal systems proceed on 
the principle of &raquo; casum sentit dominus &laquo; in his report on English law in which he 
points to the well-established rule of common law &raquo; let the loss lie where it falls &laquo;; 
this also ties in with the report by Green / Cardi on US law91. Oliphant also reports, 
however, on the tendency to extend duties to compensate. Concerns about this 
rule have led in common law to a social welfare system in the health sector92 and 
to insurance-based solutions93, at first mainly in the field of injury to workers94, 
though in this field the insurance-based solution partly emerged alongside the 
law of damages and partly suppressed it; later these rules developed into further-
reaching systems of social welfare. The availability of social benefits does not 
mean the injuring party is released from liability, rather compensation payments 
made by such are taken into account with respect to the corresponding social ben-
efits or there will be rights of recourse95. A further extension of compensation pay-

<p>ments outside of the law of damages has been provided for in some common law 
systems, eg in the United Kingdom in particular for victims of crime96, as well as 
in Canada and Australia for victims of road traffic accidents. The general no-fault 
based compensation system in New Zealand is famous; this will be discussed fur-
ther below.
</p>
<p>Mor&eacute;teau97 does say that in French law no description of the law of damages 
begins by mentioning the principle that the victim must bear his damage but also 
that in fact this would seem to be the common premise. He then discusses the 
above-mentioned tendency to relieve the victim of any and all risks and also my 
criticism to the effect that this overlooks the undeniable fact that compensation 
payments to the victim do not eliminate the loss from the world but only shift it 
to someone else, ie there is merely a shift of the damage and someone else suffers 
a disadvantage from having to cover the loss. Mor&eacute;teau agrees with this but only 
limited to within the pure law of damages context and points to how the situation 
is changed by contractual insurance policies and the social insurance systems: 
in this manner it becomes the exception that the victim bears the damage; thus, 
there is a shift from commutative to distributive justice. This is in line with the 
broadly accepted opinion that it is better for society when its members bear risks 
together and thus follow a model based on solidarity. He writes that this political 
decision has proven to be viable. Mor&eacute;teau also points out, however, that this can-
not excuse the excesses of French law when it comes to extending liability.
</p>
<p>This addresses two aspects important in relation to French law: on the one 
hand, picking up on the last point, the over-extension of the law of damages, and 
on the other hand, the covering of risks &ndash; with emphasis on the notion of solidar-
ity &ndash; by systems outside of the law of damages. The latter consist of contractual 
insurance and social insurance, which, however &ndash; apart from the field of injury to 
workers by the employer98 &ndash; provide for rights of recourse against the responsi-
ble damaging party99, so that in this respect the damaging party is not relieved of 
any burden. In relation to understanding the French system, it is important that 
&raquo; in a French perspective, at least for practical purposes, civil liability is no longer 
a central but a marginal mechanism &laquo;100. Also significant is the comment101 that 
in France the task of deterrence is not ascribed primarily to the law of damages,

<p>rather this function is associated more and more strongly with criminal law. This 
relates to the fundamental functions of the law of damages and the interplay be-
tween it and other fields of law, in which context considerable differences to the 
German legal family can be identified.
</p>
<p>In contrast there is no such wide gap between French and Scandinavian law, 
the latter in fact even exceeding the French system when it comes to consideration 
of the interests of the victim. As emphasised by Askeland102, while the Norwegian 
law of damages is also based on the principle of &raquo; casum sentit dominus &laquo;, never-
theless the notion of distributive justice has found broad resonance and that of 
commutative justice has been ever more displaced: primarily, it is considered im-
portant that the victim gets full compensation. Secondly, it is widely seen as justi-
fied that the party that caused the damage should also compensate such &ndash; natu-
rally leading to wide-ranging imputation, inter alia, by expanding no-fault based 
liability.
</p>
<p>In more recent times, insurance-based solutions and the social security net in 
Scandinavia have functioned alongside the law of damages to ensure very broad 
coverage of  personal  injury &ndash; but not, however, of other damage. Moreover, pro-
tection of the victim has been improved by the extension of compulsory liability 
insurance policies, which have largely eliminated the risk of not being able to en-
force claims for compensation103. It is of exceptional interest that in Scandinavia 
the focus on the notion of compensation has led to a far-reaching release from 
liability for the injuring party at least in the field of personal injury: no right of 
recourse is granted to the social security bodies against the injuring party, unless 
such has acted with intention104. The fact that this takes away the deterrent func-
tion of the law of damages has clearly not featured loudly in the debate, as this is 
not considered in any case to be a function of the law of damages. On the other 
hand, this system prevents over-compensation of victims, namely by reducing the 
compensation claim against the injuring party in accordance with the social bene-
fits received. This means that social security results in a considerable release from 
liability for the responsible injuring party and thus relieves such to a correspond-
ing degree from the burden of the often very high claims for compensation in case 
of personal injury. Insofar as there is liability insurance, social security ultimately 
also relieves the liability insurance of its burden by taking over its function. Those 
covered by liability insurance, however, at least enjoy the advantage that they are 
sometimes freed from paying insurance premiums and these costs are shifted to

<p>the general public who finance the social security system105. Thus, the law of dam-
ages has been partly squeezed out of the field of personal injury in Norwegian law 
and ultimately only serves to complement the social security benefits106.
</p>
<p>Polish law diverges insofar only insignificantly from the Norwegian approach: 
as Ludwichowska-Redo reports107, the principle of &raquo; casum sentit dominus &laquo; is not 
expressly mentioned in legislation but is in her opinion undoubtedly the basis 
of Polish law in this respect. However, Poland also followed the general tendency 
towards extending the protection of the victim: on the one hand, the report de-
scribes extension of liability, inter alia, by objectifying fault, basing claims merely 
on wrongfulness, the expansion of no-fault based liability and the greater recover-
ability of non-pecuniary damages108. On the other hand, the social security system 
covers personal injury, though it is particularly noteworthy that the social security 
insurer has no right of recourse in Poland either against the injuring party109, ex-
cept in respect of specific benefits paid out in cases of inability to work because 
of intentional injury110. Thus, in Polish law too there is &ndash; as in the Scandinavian 
legal systems &ndash; a partial suppression of the law of damages by the social benefits 
system. Moreover, the out-of-court compensation system111, which can be chosen 
by the patient in the case of a medical error and ensures rapid compensation al-
beit limited as to amount, also suppresses the law of damages in that the patient 
must waive all rights to claims under the law of compensation in respect of all 
he receives from this system112; accordingly these claims to compensation are not 
transferred to the pillars of the compensation system.

<p>tion as far as possible by having the disadvantages such sustained covered by the 
injuring party. Sometimes, however, the impression is given that the legitimate in-
terests of the injuring party may be forgotten. It must be taken into consideration 
that every additional or increased compensation payment to the victim places the 
burden of additional compensation duties on someone else; every increase in the 
protection of one party necessarily leads to a greater restriction of another&rsquo;s free-
dom of movement113. Covering the compensation interest of the victim by means 
of the law of damages is, moreover, only justified in this respect insofar as  the 
victim is more worthy of protection than the damaging party, ie insofar as there are 
sufficiently weighty grounds for imputation. Beyond such extent, the damage may 
only be covered by other means, in particular by distributing the burden of having 
to bear the damage. This may be achieved by shifting the burden of damage to the 
general public by means of compensation paid by the state or by distributing the 
damage among a large number of people via an insurance system.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it would seem that in the midst of efforts to extend compensa-
tion for damage already suffered, the primary task of the legal system comes too 
short in the debate114, namely that of preventing damage in the first place through 
security measures. Compensation can no longer eliminate the damage, only shift 
it to someone else. Van Boom / Pinna115 emphasise accordingly quite rightly: &raquo; Com-
pensating injury that could be avoided at lower cost for society is always a sec-
ond-best solution. &laquo; Therefore, especial attention should be accorded to prevent-
ing damage, not only by means of the deterrent effect of the law of damages and 
not only by means of private law, but in particular also via administrative law116.
</p>
<p>This extension of duties to compensate, that is apparent today, is increasingly 
accomplished &ndash; except in England &ndash; by recognising liability independent of fault117, 
in particular that of the keeper of dangerous things. As this liability is based on 
recognised fundamental concepts and is generally perceived as leading to reason-
able results, this is in principle not an alarming development. Nevertheless, the 
extension of liability independent of any wrongful action is problematic insofar

<p>as it is not openly laid out118, thus rendering decisions inexplicable and making 
future judgments impossible to predict, manipulating facts and prerequisites for 
liability and meaning the grounds for decisions cannot be traced to applicable 
rules but are based on subjective evaluations. Also worrying, moreover, are open 
developments of the liability system if the rule-maker neglects fundamental con-
siderations and imposes burdens on the injuring party that are no longer justifi-
able. How far such risks have already manifested or present an apparent threat is 
an issue that is addressed repeatedly when it comes to answering basic questions 
of the law of damages. Burdens on the injuring party that can no longer be objec-
tively justified in the absence of weighty enough reasons for attribution should 
always be avoided and efforts should be made towards accomplishing any further 
coverage of the disadvantages suffered by the victim that is deemed necessary via 
distribution of damage by means of insurance systems or at least by the state &ndash; as 
is largely the case in France.
</p>
<p>2.  Liability law and the social benefits system
</p>
<p>At this point it is time to look more closely at the more general question of whether 
and to what extent it is desirable to supplement or displace the law of damages by 
social benefits. It is certainly a fact that when it comes to personal injury, the law of 
damages in the European legal systems &ndash; unlike in the USA119 &ndash; is supplemented 
in a substantial manner by social benefits or even &ndash; in particular in the field of 
workers&rsquo; compensation120 &ndash; superseded by such; in the medical field the debate 
about the introduction of a no-fault based compensation system has once again 
subsided somewhat121.
</p>
<p>The fact that such extension of the protection afforded is limited to the field 
of personal injury is justified, on the one hand, by the fact that this relates to the 
highest ranking personal good and, on the other hand, the victim&rsquo;s very existence 
is often threatened. When it comes to injury to the person, therefore, the victim 
ought to receive compensation for damage in all cases regardless of the cause of

<p>said damage. Eliminating the necessity to check the prerequisites for liability also 
significantly helps with the realisation of this second aspect, ie the prompt pay-
ment of compensation. However, as a rule this does not extend to full compensa-
tion but only enough to cover fundamental needs.
</p>
<p>In the case of damage to property, the prerequisites for extending the pro-
tection are not met to the same extent; the pecuniary damage and also the need 
for protection are, besides this, very different from case to case so that it makes 
more sense to allow the potential victim him or herself to organise cover for the 
risks. Insofar there is basic consensus among the legal systems discussed here, 
but there are differences as regards the extent of social benefits in the case of 
personal injury, ie which costs are covered and the size of the compensation pay-
ments to be made in the case of personal injury.
</p>
<p>However, the differences as regards the possibility for the institutions that 
pay out social benefits to take recourse against the injuring party, something which 
directly affects the law of damages, appear more serious. At least at first glance it 
would seem that in this respect there are diametrically opposed views on funda-
mental issues, making it hard to see how all EU Member States might agree on 
harmonisation in the matter.
</p>
<p>An argument against any general pruning back of the right to take recourse 
is, above all, that this would displace the law of damages in the field of personal 
injury to the extent that it was covered by the social benefits, thus also substan-
tially reducing its deterrent function. These cons would only be countered by a very 
small pro: doing away with the social security system&rsquo;s recourse against the injur-
ing party would only result in very small savings in processing costs since gener-
ally the injuring party has third-party liability insurance &ndash; most personal injuries 
are caused in road traffic accidents &ndash; and the recourse claims between the social 
security institutions and the third-party liability insurers can be processed inex-
pensively due to agreements providing for lump-sum reimbursements122.
</p>
<p>However, precisely this connects up with an aspect that at the same time very 
substantially undermines the basic arguments against excluding the possibility 
of recourse: the great majority of injuring parties have third-party liability insur-

<p>that still exists when the liability insurer bears the damage, and which would be 
lost if recourse claims were precluded, consists merely in &ndash; insofar as there is any &ndash; 
consideration of the frequency of damaging events when calculating the premi-
ums due for the liability insurance. Moreover, it must be considered that the in-
juring party would still be liable for any personal injury not covered by the social 
security benefit, in particular for non-pecuniary damage and the damage to prop-
erty that usually also ensues123; thus, it would still be possible for this residual 
aspect to take into account the frequency of damaging events when calculating 
the premiums for the liability insurance. Besides this, it must be noted that the 
damage not covered by social security would retain the deterrent effect it other-
wise had in full. Finally, it must be borne in mind on the pro side when it comes to 
excluding the possibility of recourse that the &ndash; in any case sometimes doubted124 &ndash; 
deterrent effect of the law of damages is only an ancillary function of that field 
of law. Deterrence is primarily effected by criminal law, which often also applies 
when it comes to personal injury and &ndash; in particular in respect of road traffic in-
cidents &ndash; by administrative penalties, which are completely independent of any 
recourse claim option.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in the vast majority of cases even the European125 and Japanese 
social security systems have not shut out the law of damages in the field of per-
sonal injury. Exceptions have, however, been made for one particular area, spe-
cifically injury to the employee by the employer; this is based above all on the fact 
that the employer pays all or part of the employee&rsquo;s social security premiums and 
thus discharges itself of liability &ndash; at least for slightly negligent injuries126. Even in 
cases where recourse against the injuring party &ndash; as in the legal systems of Scan-
dinavia and Poland127 &ndash; is precluded, this only leads to a partial displacement of 
the law of damages, namely to the extent of the social benefit provided for; the 
duty to compensate any damage exceeding this still remains unaffected. In none 
of the legal systems looked at in this project was the law of liability fully replaced 
either comprehensively or only for the field of personal injury by a general insur-
ance-based solution and neither are there any serious efforts underway in these

<p>countries to do so; not even in the field of personal injury128. In the USA any state 
insurance-based solution is met by particularly intense resistance129, with the no-
tion of retributive justice above all seeming to play a major role.
</p>
<p>When Mor&eacute;teau130 emphasises the benefits of an insurance-based solution131, 
he is clearly thinking of a real insurance solution that does not &ndash; fully &ndash; eliminate 
the deterrence function, on the one hand because of claims for damage exceed-
ing that covered by insurance and, on the other hand, by means of how premiums 
would be calculated and deductibles. However, this basically already corresponds 
largely to today&rsquo;s European systems.
</p>
<p>Only in  New  Zealand has a comprehensive, no-fault based state compensa-
tion system for personal injury cases been introduced132, with this area of the law 
of damages being completely set aside, also incidentally as regards damage that 
exceeds the insurance benefit. The disadvantages mentioned by Oliphant, namely 
caps on compensation, loss of the deterrent effect133 and a substantial burden on 
the state ( as the tortfeasor is released from liability and the state has no right of re-
course ) were and continue to be regarded as less significant in New Zealand than 
the advantages: compensation independent of cause of damage, much cheaper 
implementation and also emphasis on the notion of community.
</p>
<p>The example from New Zealand has not managed to be so fully persuasive as 
to inspire imitation in other countries. This also seems understandable134: the lim-
its on the amount of compensation for personal injury and thus the incomplete 
protection afforded to the highest-ranking good must be considered a major fault 
of this system. The argument that claim processing is inexpensive is relative when

the law of damages but rather a not very appropriate solution as regards who bears the expense 
of a legal proceeding, which anyway will only be the case in the USA and could easily be elimi-
nated without fundamental changes to the whole compensation system. Moreover, it must be 
remembered that even when claims are made to insurers, it is frequently necessary to involve 
a lawyer.

</p>
<p>it is also taken into account that property damage often goes hand in hand with 
personal injury and compensation for the former must still be pursued separately 
using the usual legal means according to the rules of the law of damages. The 
solution predominant in Europe, combining the law of damages with insurance 
systems, seems more favourable as it exploits the advantages of the social secu-
rity system while avoiding the disadvantages associated with wholly discarding 
the application of the law of damages. The latter is, however, no longer true when 
pruning back the possibility of recourse against the injuring party leads to a par-
tial suppression of the law of damages in the case of personal injury.
</p>
<p>3.  A mediatory solution for the combination of the law of damages 
and social security law in the case of personal injury ?
</p>
<p>The French tendency to socialise damage and the Scandinavian and Polish displace-
ment of the law of damages in the case of personal injury, by excluding the possi-
bility of recourse against the injuring party135, stand in stark contrast to how the 
other legal systems retain the combination of social law and law of damages, ulti-
mately leading to the damage being borne according to the principles of the law of 
damages. These two systems, the displacement on the one hand, and the combi-
nation on the other, give an impression of being irreconcilably juxtaposed. None-
theless, it would seem possible, by further developing the Scandinavian model 
yet at the same time also developing the already existing approaches to injury to 
the employee by the employer, to arrive at a mediatory solution, which as far as 
possible retains the advantages of both systems while largely avoiding the disad-
vantages. This ought to be discussed in depth and could prospectively meet with 
some acceptance in Europe; due to the basic distaste for state regulatory interven-
tions in the USA136 acceptance is hardly likely in that legal system, however.
</p>
<p>The traditional system of combining social security and the law of damages re-
alises, on the one hand, the goal of firstly giving the victim access to fast compen-
</p>
<p>135 Very general against the rights of recourse on the part of the party providing insurance against 
damage &ndash; and thus also the social insurer &ndash; in the case of slight negligence on the part of the 
injuring party turns from von Goldbeck, Grenzen des Versichererregresses, ZEuP 2013, 283. His 
proposal is not persuasive as this would ultimately lead to the insuree providing third-party li-
ability cover to the injuring party by means of the former&rsquo;s premium payments. The attempts 
to counter this argument and the elimination of the deterrent effect of the duty to compensate 
by imposing upon the injuring party a duty to compensate for a part of the premium hardly 
seems appropriate since by these means the victim would have to bear the risks, efforts and 
expense of collecting a small contribution to the premium. Moreover, the boundary between 
slight and gross negligence, which it is barely possible to draw clearly, would acquire major sig-
nificance and thus the enforcement of the victim&rsquo;s right would become dependent on aspects 
that are very difficult to assess.

<p>sation payments on the basis of social security and independent of what caused 
the damage; these payments are usually limited, however, and thus do not achieve 
full compensation of damage; on the other hand, the possibility for the social in-
surance institution to take recourse against the injuring party means that the ex-
penses accruing in this respect must be borne by the party who is responsible for 
them under the general rules of imputation. This means the victim&rsquo;s interest in 
fast compensation payment is not dependent on the fulfilment of strict criteria 
within the framework of the social security system and its inherent limitations 
and beyond this, the notion of commutative justice and thus the notion of deter-
rence are also fully accommodated.
</p>
<p>However, it must be taken into account that the injuring party&rsquo;s duty to com-
pensate will be covered in most cases by &ndash; voluntary or compulsory &ndash; liability insur-
ance and that thus firstly, the social insurer&rsquo;s recourse will have only a very minor 
deterrent effect, dependent on a corresponding premium basis taking into account 
the risk of damage. Nonetheless, the notion of imputation of damage still has effect 
in that the responsible injuring party must pay the insurance premiums and thus 
must bear the costs of having cover against damage via the liability insurer.
</p>
<p>On the negative side, procedural costs fall due twice because of the recourse 
proceeding between the social insurer and the injuring party&rsquo;s liability insurer. 
However, these are kept very low by the usual procedure ( see above no 8 / 83 ) of us-
ing yearly, lump-sum payments of the expenses incurred by the social insurer for 
victims who bring compensation claims against injuring parties with liability in-
surance, so that no really urgent need for any simplification can be established.
</p>
<p>The Scandinavian-Polish system, which of course offers the victim the same 
advantages as the conventional system, can also lay claim to a further advantage 
in that its basic concept of excluding recourse claims already eliminates the need 
for double payment of procedural expenses. However, the problem with this solu-
tion is that the deterrent effect provided by the law of damages is completely shut 
off due to the lack of a claim for recourse by the social insurer against either the 
injuring party or the liability insurer; neither can this be maintained at least in-
directly by means of risk-adjusted premium payments. It is worrying that the in-
juring party &ndash; unlike in some legal systems the employer in the field of workers&rsquo; 
accident insurance137 &ndash; must not even bear the costs of covering the damage via 
correspondingly calculated insurance premiums paid to liability insurers, but in-
stead such costs are passed on to the general public; and since social security is 
damage insurance, thus to the whole group of potential victims138.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>As far as the worries regarding the lacking deterrent effect of the Scandina-
vian-Polish system are concerned, it can conversely be pointed out that in any case 
it is often doubted whether the law of damages really has such effect anyway139 and 
that any effect in existence would in any case be substantially reduced by the avail-
ability of voluntary or compulsory liability insurance. Finally, it can be argued 
that in the field of personal injury the injuring party is still threatened anyway to a 
large extent by the possibility of having to pay compensation firstly for the victim&rsquo;s 
pecuniary harm not covered by social security, but above all also for the victim&rsquo;s 
non-pecuniary damage, which is not covered by social security, as well as very of-
ten the application of criminal law that has a definite deterrent effect. These argu-
ments certainly have their justification but it must nonetheless still be considered 
that criminal law does not always apply and that the law of damages hitherto has 
still managed to have a certain deterrent effect, even despite the existence of lia-
bility insurance cover, when the premium system is designed accordingly and the 
injuring party must thus anticipate, in addition to criminal penalties, a financially 
noticeable response to his injuring conduct.
</p>
<p>Above all, however, these arguments concerning deterrence cannot refute one 
major objection to the preclusion of recourse claims and thus against releasing 
the injuring party from liability: the pruning back of the right to recourse, and 
thus ultimately having the damage covered by social security, means the responsi-
ble injuring party no longer even has to bear the costs of a liability insurance policy 
to the extent corresponding to the liability risk. Insofar as such party has in fact 
liability insurance cover, when the premiums for this are calculated it is no longer 
the damage that is ultimately borne by the social security system &ndash; ie without re-
course against the injuring party &ndash; that is taken into account since there is no li-
ability risk in this sense. On the other hand, it seems very dubious that especial 
attention is paid to the fact that the social security system has no means to take 
recourse in the above cases and thus must ultimately bear the cost of all personal 
injuries. In any case, the contributions paid for social security are not assessed ac-
cording to the rules applicable for liability insurance but according to the princi-
ples of social security insurance, so that in this respect those with social security 
insurance do not pay amounts proportionate to liability insurance cover based on 
the risk of damage.
</p>
<p>In order to arrive at the appropriate solution that the responsible injuring 
party &ndash; like the employer in the field of workers&rsquo; accident insurance &ndash; must at 
least bear the costs of the insurance for the liability risk he realises, it is neces-
sary to bear in mind the function of a social insurer, all of whose rights of re-
course against the injuring party or the liability insurance of such have been cut

</p>
<p>off: as Askeland140 emphasises, and as has also been stressed in respect of the field 
of workers&rsquo; accident insurance141, social insurance in such constellations is really 
general compulsory liability insurance for personal injury to the benefit of the in-
juring party. However, it cannot be objectively justified that each and every burden 
or at least every risk-appropriate burden corresponding to a liability insurance 
policy be taken from the party responsible for the damage and shifted to the gen-
eral public, as social security is financed by the contributions from employers, in-
come-dependent fees from those insured and by the state142. This also fails to take 
account of the notion of commutative justice in any remotely adequate manner.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it is necessary that in respect of covering imputable damage spe-
cial regard be had to the second function of social insurance &ndash; ie compulsory li-
ability insurance created by precluding the possibility of taking recourse except in 
the case of intention &ndash; and to treat it accordingly too: insofar as in fact the issue 
is general, compulsory liability insurance in favour of the responsible injuring 
party, such must also bear the costs in proportion to the risk. This certainly can-
not be achieved by somehow increasing the social security contributions for all 
insurance-holders, employers and the state, since this would mean &ndash; unlike in the 
case of a liability insurance &ndash; that neither the completely different liability risks 
of the variously hazardous activities or the individual liability bases can be taken 
into account. However, it is at least a step in the right direction when, for example, 
in Norway contributions must be paid to social security insurance providers in 
the field of motor vehicles and employer&rsquo;s liability insurance143; nonetheless this 
is not sufficient because it does not cover all potential liable parties that get the 
benefit of the &raquo; social liability insurance &laquo;, instead two important groups are picked 
out. In respect of the sub-field of &raquo; social liability insurance &laquo;, however, it would 
make sense, as in contractual liability insurance, to base premiums payable upon 
the risk in order to ensure that the parties responsible for damage according to the 
rules of the law of damages must pay in proportion to the size of the liability risk 
they created. This would maintain the residual deterrent effect as in the system 
conventional today.
</p>
<p>Put in other words, it must be taken into account that the social insurer in re-
ality performs two functions: on the one hand, the provision of traditional dam-
age insurance in the interest of the sick and injured parties; on the other hand, the 
provision of liability insurance in the interest of the damaging party, who causes 
personal injury in an imputable manner. These two different insurance functions

</p>
<p>also necessitate different premium bases in order to appropriately take account 
of the different risks. The fact that both insurance functions are to be taken on by 
one institution ought therefore not to change anything about different premium 
calculations bases since it is only a combination of different tasks in one institu-
tion that is at issue.
</p>
<p>Given all of this, precluding recourse by the social insurer against the injur-
ing party and any liability insurer covering such would no longer be problematic 
in any way and would only have advantages in that the costs of double processing 
would be avoided. However, it would become more complicated for the social se-
curity provider to calculate the contributions.
</p>
<p>It ought to be considered whether ultimately it would not be even more prag-
matic and cost-effective to entrust &raquo; social liability insurance &laquo; to the insurance 
companies in order to relieve the social security providers of the burden. In order 
to attain really blanket coverage of social insurance, contractual liability insur-
ance for everybody would have to be compulsory. The wide distribution of the bur-
den would mean it could be provided cheaply. Recourse by the social security pro-
viders against the liability insurer could also be organised as lump-sum payments, 
for which there are already tried-and-tested procedures to serve as an example.
</p>
<p>As the general rules of imputation under the law of damages are not cast aside 
by this system, which instead only sets out a general liability insurance, some im-
portant questions must still be considered in the necessary debate on the intro-
duction of a general &raquo; social liability insurance &laquo;. Of particular importance would 
be to what extent the cover provided under the liability insurance should extend; 
present-day social insurance does not offer complete compensation of personal 
injury; contractual liability insurance, on the other hand, is always subject to max-
imum limits. If this system is retained, this will serve to uphold the deterrent ef-
fect because, when damage runs into larger amounts, the injuring party&rsquo;s liabil-
ity becomes relevant once again but, on the other hand, it means that, precisely 
when there is particularly extensive damage, the compensation must be paid out 
of one&rsquo;s own assets so that in particular when very serious damage is concerned, 
the victim would have to bear the risk of whether compensation would be paid 
and must expect quite often not to receive full compensation. This would thus 
mean retaining today&rsquo;s inconsistent system to the effect that both injuring party 
and victim are fully covered in cases of more minor damage, but not when they 
are affected particularly seriously. Besides this, it must be taken into account that 
the limits as to the compensation payable by insurance or also in relation to the 
recoverable damage means that the victim must additionally assert claims under 
the law of damages in order to achieve full compensation. This would not be a

<p>desirable system, as G. Wagner  144 rightly emphasises in respect of workers&rsquo; acci-
dent insurance designed in this manner: &raquo; The bargain offered by workers&rsquo; com-
pensation systems is to balance a more generous liability rule by rather parsi-
monious quantum rules and by savings in the form of administrative costs. The 
balance between these cost items is disturbed, and any savings in administrative 
costs are wasted if victims are allowed to sue the employer in civil court for com-
plementary damages. In fact, such a two-layered system represents the worst of all 
worlds because it burdens society with the administrative costs not of one but of 
two sets of compensation mechanisms. &laquo; This expensive &ndash; also for the victim &ndash; co-
existence of insurance cover and claims for damages can only be largely avoided 
if the compulsory liability insurance covers at least all personal injuries &ndash; even 
non-pecuniary injuries; nonetheless damage to property would still have to be ac-
tioned separately. However, any unlimited insurance cover would certainly also be 
problematic, though at least the general duty to take out liability insurance would 
mean very inexpensive insurance cover could be offered even for very high sums 
of liability: besides this, only the more extensive voluntary cover would remain un-
resolved. It ought to be examined, therefore, whether it would be possible to offer 
unlimited cover or whether at least the maximum amounts of cover can be set so 
high that they would in any case still cover foreseeable damage.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it ought to be considered how, if premiums were calculated de-
pending on  risk,  that incentive peculiar to the law of damages, the avoidance of 
damage, would be retained145. Ultimately it is important not to neglect the option 
to take partial or full recourse if the injuring party is no longer worthy of protec-
tion, ie in particular in the case of intentional and especially inconsiderate inflic-
tion of damage, but also if the injuring party has derived advantages from his 
damaging behaviour.

</p>
<p>II.  Strict limits and rigid norms or fluid transitions 
and elastic rules ?
</p>
<p>A.  Comparative law review
</p>
<p>Not all country reports comprehensively discuss strict delimitation of the bases 
for claims in order to distinguish between absolutely protected and unprotected 
interests, the all-or-nothing principle or the advantages of elastic rules. This is 
likely due to the lack of a corresponding debate on the principles. However, at 
least some important aspects are addressed and besides this, the problems do 
come in for discussion in the context of some individual questions; they are then 
discussed accordingly in respect of such.
</p>
<p>Menyh&aacute;rd146 emphasises with respect to Hungary that there is a tendency to-
wards more open rules that allow the courts room for discretion in reaching their 
decision and the recognition of a flexible system. He differentiates between the 
necessity to distinguish clearly between the individual legal concepts and the af-
firmation of fluid transitions and gradations. He also stresses that a strict distinc-
tion between absolutely protected and unprotected goods is alien to Hungarian 
law, but that regard will be had to the ranking of the respective goods. The &raquo; all-
or-nothing &laquo; principle is theoretically recognised but not implemented in practice, 
especially due to the recognition of partial causation, ie only in respect of certain 
parts of the overall damage.
</p>
<p>In respect of France, Mor&eacute;teau147 emphasises, however, the tendency towards 
flexible solutions, as regards the extent of the compensation as well as the disin-
clination towards strict delimitation, for example between contractual infringe-
ments and delicts or between absolutely protected and unprotected interests as 
well as with respect to all-or-nothing solutions, which also leads to increased sup-
port for a reduction clause148. This openness towards flexibility is certainly dis-
cernible but contrasts with the foreign observer&rsquo;s impression that &ndash; unlike other 
legal systems &ndash; French law is often lacking in a readiness to differentiate, which is 
essential for flexible solutions. This applies in particular in respect of the principe 
d&rsquo;&eacute;quivalence, which promotes equivalence between the different kinds of fault 
and the prejudices suffered or interests protected; as a consequence &raquo; French law 
is said to assume that any licit interest deserves protection and that all such inter-
ests deserve equal protection &laquo;149. This does present a counter-position rejecting

<p>strict delimitation between absolutely protected and unprotected goods but is just 
as rigid as that position.
</p>
<p>The Norwegian law of damages is based &ndash; as Askeland150 explains &ndash; mainly on 
general principles, of which only a few are laid down in statutory law. The legisla-
tor very deliberately allows the courts a very wide margin of discretion, because 
the law of damages is &raquo; the law of the unexpected events &laquo; and thus it is not always 
possible to have clear rules in advance. Extensive areas are therefore structured 
by the case law of the Supreme Court, which is binding upon lower courts. The 
statement that: &raquo; On principle, one might say that the Norwegian system to a large 
extent features possibilities of reaching proportionality between the prerequisite 
of a legal rule and the effect of the rule &laquo; is important. Surprisingly, Askeland151 sees 
the rigid all-or-nothing principle as the inevitable consequence of the causation 
theory and as anchored solidly in Norwegian law. However, this is somewhat in 
conflict with the existence of a reduction clause and the consideration of contribu-
tory fault that leads to apportionment of the damage152.
</p>
<p>Ludwichowska-Redo153 emphasises that the all-or-nothing principle is adhered 
to in Polish law and partial liability in cases of alternative causation is not recog-
nised. Furthermore, not only are strict boundaries widely acknowledged between 
the individual legal fields but also between contract and delict as well as between 
fault liability and liability based on dangerousness.  Ludwichowska-Redo  shows, 
nonetheless, that interim gradations can certainly also be detected in this respect, 
as in the case of culpa in contrahendo, or at least exist since, for example, fault-
based liability and strict liability both have various gradations and converge to-
wards each other, for example by the objectivisation of fault. In Poland, clear, firm 
rules are ultimately preferred, however &ndash; as in Germany, for instance &ndash; they are 
supplemented by very general and thus undefined general clauses. The flexible 
system is in any case unknown and due to the difficulty associated with its imple-
mentation, there would seem to be considerable impediments to recognising it.
</p>
<p>The outsider would assume common law to incorporate a certain inherent 
flexibility, since after all individual decisions do not set out strict, general rules. 
Oliphant154 emphasises, however, that &raquo; the nature of common law systems &ndash; where 
the judge is the prime mover of legal development, not the legislator &ndash; has meant 
that judges attach particular importance to certainty as they create, apply and de-
velop &rsaquo;case law&lsaquo;. The doctrine of precedent ( stare decisis ) is perhaps the most ob-
vious product of this philosophy. &laquo; Nevertheless, this must ultimately only mean

<p>that the rule relating to an individual case must be formulated as clearly as pos-
sible. Since, however, it is unlikely that such rules will lead to a closed, overall 
system, enough room for discretion must remain in order to elaborate the dif-
ferences between the different cases and the extent to which previous decisions 
do not apply and, in further developing the position, come to a diverging rule. 
Moreover, Oliphant stresses that often a certain amount of arbitrariness must be 
accepted in that more or less undefined rules are set out and moreover a flexible 
approach can be discerned, for example in recognising partial liability in the case 
of contributory responsibility or uncertain causation as well as &raquo; policy considera-
tions &laquo; when determining the duties of care.
</p>
<p>For the US system, the rules are also characterised of course by their founda-
tion in individual cases. Green / Cardi155 clearly explain why the differences between, 
but also the interplay of, the different legal fields are hardly discussed and seen 
just as seldom: &raquo; &rsaquo;The Law of Obligation&lsaquo; is not a common phrase in US law, and 
students are taught in separate courses with separate texts and separate profes-
sors the law of contract and the law of tort. &laquo; This is of course anything but helpful 
when it comes to developing a consistent overall system that strives towards equal 
treatment and thus it should not be seen as a model when it comes to unifying EU 
law. That said, the &raquo; all-or-nothing &laquo; principle has increasingly disappeared from 
US law156.
</p>
<p>B.  Conclusions
</p>
<p>As far as the delimitation between the different bases for claims is concerned, the 
two viewpoints, namely on the one hand that these must be differentiated strictly, 
and on the other, that there are fluid transitions, can &ndash; as Menyh&aacute;rd aptly argues &ndash; 
very well be combined157. This may at first seem puzzling but they are reconcilable 
precisely because they address different aspects158. On the one hand, it cannot be 
denied that individual legal fields or instruments are intended in part to fulfil dif-
ferent tasks, in part provide for different legal consequences, and accordingly also 
set out different prerequisites. To this extent, clear delineation not only makes 
sense, it is necessary in order to understand the legal system as a logical whole. 
In this sense both criminal law and the law of damages as well as the law of un-
just enrichment aim at the protection of legal goods. However, criminal law does

<p>this by implementing the notion of deterrence by providing for penalties, the law 
of damages does it by imposing a duty to compensate the damage caused and 
the law on unjust enrichment by ordering a disgorgement of the enrichment un-
justly acquired159. The gravity of the legal consequences provided for decreases in 
the same order160, and likewise the prerequisites become accordingly less weighty 
and range from the subjective blameworthiness of the precisely described inter-
ferences with protected goods to merely objective realisation of interference in 
third-party goods, without fault or even duties of care being relevant. Likewise, 
within the field of the law of damages, in its core the fault-based liability based on 
misconduct can very clearly be distinguished from the strict liability that can be 
incurred merely by the permitted use of a source of high danger161. The grounds 
for imputation are thus very different and accordingly, fault-based liability serves 
commutative justice and liability based on dangerousness, on the other hand, dis-
tributive justice. This necessarily clear separability, however, should not blind one 
to the fact that interim forms of liability have already been elaborated162 and natu-
rally even more may be created, though the question does arise whether and how 
the rules of the legal fields between which the hybrid form is positioned should be 
combined to make a consistent overall system. The fact that such hybrid forms ex-
ist can be demonstrated in most legal systems and is ultimately also recognised in 
respect of the field of fault-based / strict liability too163. To this extent, it should be 
possible to achieve consensus.
</p>
<p>It is understandable that the rigid distinction advocated in German law be-
tween  absolutely protected and unprotected  interests164 finds no support either in 
French law165 or in certain other legal systems166, as in reality there are no goods 
with completely unrestricted protection and neither is there any legally recog-
nised interest that enjoys absolutely no protection, for example not even with re-
spect to being damaged intentionally or even contra bonos mores; even purely 
economic and non-pecuniary interests enjoy limited protection after all. On the 
other hand, neither is it astonishing that the French principe d&rsquo;&eacute;quivalence is met 
with very considerable scepticism in other legal systems as it is very obvious that

<p>730 Helmut&emsp;Koziol&emsp; &emsp; Comparative conclusions
</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>all legal systems have a hierarchy of legally recognised and protected interests167. 
The different ranking of interests is demonstrated for instance even in the fact 
that the basic rights have been anchored in the international human rights con-
ventions and constitutional law and practically all states stipulate fundamental 
rights for people. Furthermore, criminal law shows very clearly that goods enjoy 
different levels of protection and, not least, private law also often differentiates 
when assigning defences. This is increasingly acknowledged &ndash; sometimes openly 
and sometimes tacitly &ndash; in France too and this recognition is already to be found 
in reform proposals there168. The common opinion among almost all legal sys-
tems that the protection of interests of different ranks must be different and thus 
also the duties of care can be more intensive or less strict will thus encounter 
hardly any serious resistance.
</p>
<p>It is more difficult to find consensus on whether or not the &raquo; all-or-nothing prin-
ciple &laquo; should apply. There would seem at first to be an unbridgeable gap between 
French and Norwegian law; nonetheless, ultimately this appears not quite true. 
For instance, the principle of apportionment of damage when the victim has joint 
responsibility applies nowadays presumably in all legal systems169. Furthermore, 
there is also a reduction clause in Norway even though the all-or-nothing princi-
ple is otherwise maintained. Finally, it must be pointed out that the boundaries of 
imputation, as drawn by adequacy and the protective purpose of the rule, which 
are widely recognised, can lead in sum to adjusted compensation for damage. On 
the other hand, in Austria the gradation of compensation according to the degree 
of fault is rejected nowadays de lege ferenda and is no longer to be found in the 
reform drafts. Thus, one could say that full compensation when the prerequisites 
for liability are fulfilled is recognised in general but only within the boundaries 
drawn by adequacy and protective purpose of the rule, consideration of the vic-
tim&rsquo;s contributory responsibility and often subject to a reduction clause; insofar 
there remains little doubt that there are very substantial deviations from the all-
or-nothing principle.
</p>
<p>The correct question is therefore not simply whether the all-or-nothing prin-
ciple should be recognised or not, but to what extent it should apply and when 
departures from it are appropriate. The answer depends on the countervailing 
main concerns of the legal systems and their optimal implementation: on the one 
hand, there is the aspect of  legal certainty, on the other hand justice in the spe-
cific case at hand. Legal certainty certainly suffers if the extent of the compensa-

<p>tion recoverable is not foreseeable because it depends on too many, insufficiently 
clear prerequisites, the affirmation or rejection of which is then necessarily largely 
at the discretion of the judge.  Justice  in  the particular  case at hand,  in turn, suf-
fers when boundaries are drawn too rigidly, meaning that minor differences de-
termine whether there is full compensation of damage or no compensation at all. 
It must be stressed in this context that legal certainty is also impaired here, as it 
is then hardly foreseeable whether the court will see the material circumstance 
as lying a little on this side or on the other of the respective boundary. This un-
certainty is very generally increased by the rule on proof applicable in common 
law170, which is based on the balance of probabilities and thus makes the decision 
dependent on whether the inexactly ascertainable probability is found to be 49 % 
or 51 %; however, this already relates to a general problem of burden of proof and 
not a specific substantive law of damages problem.
</p>
<p>It is controversial whether besides the above-mentioned widely recognised de-
viations from the all-or-nothing principle, namely in the case of contributory fault, 
the boundaries set by adequacy and purpose of the rule and the reduction clause 
that applies by way of exception, other departures also ought to be accepted. The 
hard core of the debate on the all-or-nothing principle would seem to lie mainly in 
the area of uncertain causation. Neither a compromise nor the successful persua-
sion of the respective &raquo; opposing sides &laquo; seems within sight at present; this will be 
discussed in more detail below ( see no 8 / 214 ff ). The fact that partial compensa-
tion solutions are almost exclusively advocated for the field of potential causation 
and not in the case of wrongfulness or fault is presumably due to the possible fact 
that the perpetrators in causation cases in any case carried out some act that was 
dangerous to a highly concrete degree in a manner imputable to them, namely 
breaching duties of care and culpably, and thus are accountable for the lack of 
clarity as regards causation. However, when it comes to determining breach of 
duty of care or fault, it is not even clear whether the person in question is blame-
able in any way, therefore neither can they be deemed accountable for the lack of 
clarity, for which they might otherwise be blamed.
</p>
<p>As to the question of whether rigid, firm or elastic rules are preferable, there 
is considerable disagreement, for example between France, Norway, Poland and 
Austria on the one hand, and Germany on the other. However, a first step in the 
sense of agreement on a middle course does seem achievable. By this, I do not 
mean the flexible system171 I favour; in this respect the perceived difficulty of its 
implementation gives rise as yet to too many concerns and much persuasion work 
remains to be done.

<p>732 Helmut&emsp;Koziol&emsp; &emsp; Comparative conclusions
</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>As already explained above in the preliminary remarks ( no 8 / 46 ff ), rigid rules 
almost inevitably &ndash; as shown by the German example &ndash; make it impossible to 
adapt to changing circumstances and the courts take flight to the general clauses 
and end up trying to circumvent the hard and fast rules, which is not exactly fa-
vourable to the intended legal certainty but instead makes decisions unpredicta-
ble and inexplicable. On the other hand, general rules, as we know them in French 
and Austrian law, mean that insufficient guidelines can be given to the courts as 
the rules are too hazy. A middle course between these two extremes would at least 
be capable of consensus, with more elastic rules being formulated but then also 
reinforced by the definition of factors material for specification. This would mean 
there was as far as possible consideration of the main countervailing concerns, 
namely the need for legal certainty &ndash; this being addressed by clarity and specific-
ity, as well as sufficient elasticity in order to decide individual cases appropriately. 
At least this middle course would be necessary for rules that are intended to serve 
harmonisation or unification purposes as otherwise in the case of open, unde-
fined rules it must be feared that they would be applied too differently in various 
countries due to the diverse national legal cultures.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the following difficulty, which no doubt is often the reason that 
rigid instead of elastic rules are promulgated, must also be mentioned: the formu-
lation of elastic, more general provisions means that the rule-maker must previ-
ously have reached clarity on which fundamental notions and which value judge-
ments are material in respect of the rule&rsquo;s scope; only then can the factors that 
should be taken into account be stipulated, factors that can provide guidance on 
the concretisation of the rule. The Continental legislators shy away from this work, 
keeping their focus mostly on the governing of some particular, current problem 
and not a consistent, overall system. In the common law, this issue is aggravated 
by the fact that the courts&rsquo; task is in fact to decide specific cases brought before 
them and not to develop a system of general rules &ndash; albeit they ought to take these 
fundamental concepts into account when making their decision.

<p> Part 2  The law of damages within the system for the 
protection of rights and legal interests
</p>
<p>I.  The term &raquo; law of damages &laquo;
</p>
<p>In the German version of &raquo; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Germanic Perspec-
tive &laquo; ( &raquo; Grundfragen des Schadenersatzrechtes &laquo; ), the title of the second chapter 
refers to &raquo; Schadenersatzrecht &laquo; within the framework for protecting legal goods 
( &raquo; im Gef&uuml;ge des Rechtsg&uuml;terschutzes &laquo; ). Despite all uncertainties regarding the 
meaning of the term &raquo; Schadenersatzrecht &laquo;172, it is nonetheless clear that it refers 
to those rules that set out under which conditions and to what extent a victim may 
seek compensation for damage suffered. It may, however, be questionable whether 
it addresses extra-contractual compensation exclusively or also includes contrac-
tual compensation.
</p>
<p>In the English version, &raquo; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Germanic Per-
spective &laquo;, chapter 2 is entitled &raquo; The law of damages within the system for the pro-
tection of rights and legal interests &laquo;; thus, in contrast to the title of the book, the 
reference is not to &raquo; tort law &laquo;. This is an attempt to take account of the translation 
difficulties mentioned in the &raquo; Preface &laquo; to the book and to make it as clear as pos-
sible that the rules at issue are those that are referred to in German as &raquo; Schaden-
ersatzrecht &laquo; and thus relate to the compensation of damage caused. The expression 
&raquo; tort law &laquo; was avoided as the area that it covers is substantially broader and thus 
precisely this expression is not useful when trying to clearly define the topics at 
issue &ndash; which are rooted in the compensation of damage: the law of torts under 
common law includes not only the &raquo; true torts &laquo;, which lay out &raquo; damages &laquo; as the 
legal consequence173, but also torts that do not require the existence of damage 
and thus are not directed at compensating such, or which lead to claims for sur-
render of property, injunctions or disgorgement of profit. Besides this, as regards 
&raquo; damages &laquo;, it is only &raquo; compensatory damages &laquo; &ndash; which admittedly are the core 
type174 &ndash; that aim at compensating damage; this is not the case with respect to 
gain-based175, restitutionary, exemplary or punitive, nominal or contemptuous

<p>damages176. Therefore, only the law of those torts that provide for compensatory 
damages corresponds to the law of damages in the German speaking countries 
and in other Continental European legal systems.
</p>
<p>This chapter deals with the position of the liability laws directed at the com-
pensation of damage caused within the overall system for rules protecting legal 
rights and interests also directed at other legal consequences, for example relating 
to preventive injunctions, reparative injunctions, claims for the surrender of un-
just enrichment, for disgorgement of profit, social security law and claims against 
compensation funds177, in particular in respect of mass catastrophes178 and terror-
ist attacks179. This is important because the aim is to reveal the relationship be-
tween legal consequences and the prerequisites for claims.
</p>
<p>II.  Comparative review
</p>
<p>On the one hand, in the common law area the isolation of the law of torts already 
mentioned above ( no 8 / 29 ) and the specialisation of academics in this legal field 
manifestly lead to a neglect of surrounding protection mechanisms and thus also 
of the functional interplay of the different legal fields with their different legal 
tools. On the other hand, the collection of very different torts with diverging pre-
requisites and extremely different legal consequences together under one heading 
certainly does not help with elaborating the common elements of the roughly 70 
different torts180.
</p>
<p>However, concentrating on the law of damages for whatever other reasons can 
also lead to a loss of the big picture regarding the protection of legal rights and in-
terests; perhaps this is one of the reasons why the law of damages panel ( Fach-
senat ) of the German Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) overlooked the

instead misused the law of damages, and in doing so disregarded its true func-
tion, for the disgorgement of a benefit gained. The country reports &ndash; except for 
France181 &ndash; also suggest that beyond the common law area, the interplay of the dif-
ferent legal tools available under the legal systems, which according to their dif-
ferent functions have different prerequisites and diverse legal consequences, is 
very generally neglected. This clearly leads not only to neglect of the differences 
between the claims and how they should interplay appropriately but also to unfair 
results, since cases that should be evaluated differently are treated alike and those 
that are alike are treated differently, so that in the end ill-founded decisions are 
the outcome.

<p>A fundamental concern that is practically taken for granted from a justice per-
spective182, namely the balancing of  the  claims&rsquo; prerequisites with  their  legal  conse-
quences so that the graver the legal consequences the more weighty the prerequi-
sites must be, is given surprisingly little consideration in English law in respect of 
the entire system of protection for legal rights and interests, although in the con-
text of the law of damages itself it is emphasised as a basic principle that &raquo; liabil-
ity imposed should be proportionate to the gravity of his conduct &laquo;183. Hence, Oli-
phant184 rightly anticipates that Continental Europeans will be astonished to see 
that under English law it is the law of torts that presents the most important tool 
to regain lost possession of things. The common law missed out on developing a 
legal tool corresponding to rei vindicatio; only via the factual elements of the tort 
of &raquo; conversion &laquo; is a claim for recovery created for the owner when his ownership 
rights have been infringed185. As the Continental claim to have property restituted 
to the owner ( Eigentumsklage ) does not set out any greater prerequisites other 
than that the claimant must be the owner and that the defendant should have no 
objective right to possession, there appears to be a very substantial difference in 
this respect to the English claim based on conversion, as such comes under the 
law of torts. The difference is not quite so great as first appears, however, as the de-
lict of &raquo; conversion &laquo; does not require any fault but only wrongfulness in the sense 
of the behaviour of the defendant infringing the ownership right of the claimant. 
Nevertheless, this in turn leads, on the other hand, to a glaring contrast with Con-
tinental law as, in the absence of fault, the defendant is made liable, on the one 
hand, like an insurer for the loss of a thing186 and, on the other hand, also for the 
consequential damage resulting from infringing ownership rights. Thus, dealing

</p>
<p>with the claims to recover under the &raquo; law of torts &laquo; &ndash; inappropriately to Continental 
European eyes &ndash; means that not only do the prerequisites for the simple recovery 
claim appear to have been set far too high, but also that those for liability for con-
sequential damage and loss of the thing in question appear far too low.
</p>
<p>By comparison, when it comes to preventive and reparative injunctions, which 
in common law are also handled under the &raquo; law of torts &laquo;187, it is taken into account 
in manifold ways that these usually constitute less onerous legal consequences 
than does meeting claims for compensation of damage sustained: the prevailing 
opinion is that no fault is required for an injunction to be granted188. The relation-
ship with claims for unjust enrichment based on interference, which also repre-
sent a less onerous legal tool and the interplay with this seems, on the other hand, 
not to have been considered adequately in England189.
</p>
<p>Far less onerous legal consequences are stipulated by English law subject to 
the usually nonetheless weighty prerequisites of the law of torts in the form of 
nominal damages190: these are merely intended as recognition of the fact that the 
claimant&rsquo;s rights were infringed although no pecuniary damage was caused. Thus, 
they could be counted as a type of natural restitution in cases in which only non-
pecuniary harm is sustained191. On the other hand, the law of torts also provides 
for punitive damages and other legal consequences that actually go beyond com-
pensating damage and partially have a penal nature192, so that the boundary with 
criminal law seems to have been crossed. It is noteworthy, firstly, that this involves 
the imposition of punishment and thus very grave legal consequences193, without 
in particular the requirements set out by criminal law and criminal procedural 
law having to be met, for example as regards the principle of nulla poena sine lege 
or the burden of proof; it even suggests that the camouflaging of such as a law of 
damages claim may indeed be aimed at circumventing the stricter criminal law 
standards. Moreover, incorporating it into private law means that the penalty paid 
does not fall to the state but to the claimant, meaning in turn that such gains a 
windfall not justifiable under private law since he receives considerably more than 
the compensation of his loss.

spect of the transfer of penal functions to private law, it may be important to con-

</p>
<p>sider that criminal law has a relatively reduced scope194 and above all that it does 
not cover slightly or indeed grossly negligent actions; moreover, administrative 
penal law is by no means as important as in Continental Europe.
</p>
<p>As far as social benefits in England and the Commonwealth countries are con-
cerned, Oliphant195 points to the interplay between the law of torts and the workers&rsquo; 
compensation systems, which in particular in Great Britain have developed into 
a general social welfare system. Since 1989 there is no longer double satisfaction; 
this has been accomplished more by deducting social benefits from compensa-
tion than by independent recourse against the injuring party.
</p>
<p>In respect of the  USA,  Green / Cardi196  express doubts that criminal law can 
exert sufficient deterrent effect, in particular insofar as mass damage caused by 
companies is concerned. Accordingly, Green / Cardi197 &ndash; like G. Wagner198 &ndash; advocate 
a modification of punitive damages, which they dub &raquo; incentive-enhancing dam-
ages &laquo;, at least for areas in which compensation claims serving to remedy damage 
also fail. The fact that the famous Caroline case is quoted also shows, however, 
that Green / Cardi  like the German Federal Court of Justice ( Bundesgerichtshof ) 
do not always take into consideration the appropriate functions in the interplay 
between the law of damages and that of unjust enrichment. Nevertheless, they do 
stress that the claim for &raquo; restitution &laquo;, which is directed as disgorgement of un-
just enrichment, unlike the law of torts, does not require any wrongdoing199; thus, 
regard is had to the balance between legal consequences and prerequisites. In 
contrast, the more system-appropriate variation of punitive damages addressed in 
Basic Questions I200, where anything exceeding the costs undertaken by the claim-
ant is paid to the state or to social institutions and where criminal law principles 
receive adequate consideration in the proceeding, is not considered. Insofar the 
justified references made by Green / Cardi to gaps in protection still cannot carry 
the argument that such penalty payments may be awarded to the claimant in com-
pensation claim proceedings201.
</p>
<p>Norwegian law is clearly somewhere between common law and legal systems 
with comprehensive codification, as it provides only for partial rules. It is remark-
able that the courts nonetheless see their tasks very differently to their common

<p>law counterparts: as Askeland202 emphasises, the courts are &raquo; apt to construct and 
develop general private law principles &laquo;. This is clearly juxtaposed to the strong 
case-by-case emphasis highlighted by  Green / Cardi. The Norwegian courts thus 
strive &ndash; as Askeland stresses &ndash; towards the development of a consistent overall sys-
tem; in so doing they promote fairness by having regard to the principle of equal 
treatment and at the same time also foreseeability and transparency of decisions. 
Askeland203 therefore rightly says: &raquo; The Norwegian approach may in the terms of 
van Dam probably be placed somewhere in between the German &rsaquo;pyramidic&lsaquo; law 
and the English case-oriented and pragmatic law. &laquo;
</p>
<p>Accordingly,  Askeland204  can also report that in Norway efforts are discerni-
ble towards distinguishing the individual legal areas and instruments from each 
other, to use them according to their functions and to grade the prerequisites of 
the claim according to the gravity of the legal consequence205. For instance, out-
side the law of damages the legal instruments of rei vindicatio, preventive injunc-
tions and the actio Pauliana are recognised. Furthermore, a distinction is drawn 
between covering the damage via the means available under the law of damages 
and disgorgement of unjust enrichment, albeit the law on unjust enrichment is 
not yet clearly and comprehensively developed. It is remarkable that Norwegian 
law has developed the following principle taking account of the notion of deter-
rence206, which Wilburg207 above all has proposed for the further development of 
the law on unjust enrichment in Austrian and German law: Whoever deliberately 
uses a third party&rsquo;s goods without being entitled to do so for his own advantage 
shall pay an appropriate fee for this. The Austrian Civil Code ( ABGB ) also has fur-
ther regard to the notion of deterrence in that it provides for the highest price 
available on the market in this respect ( &sect; 417 ABGB ).
</p>
<p>Norwegian law208 also takes into account the primary compensation aim of 
the law of damages, increasingly also in the field of non-pecuniary damage, and in 
contrast, the primary deterrence aim of criminal law, while the fundamental dif-
ference between the tasks of public and private law also plays a role; accordingly 
the Supreme Court has never yet awarded punitive damages.
</p>
<p>As already mentioned above ( no 8 / 74 ), a decisive role is played in Norway by 
the notion of solidarity when it comes to personal injury. This leads in turn to gen-
erous social benefits and a relegation of the law of damages to the background in 
this context.

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>In his contribution on French law, Mor&eacute;teau209 recognises the need to clarify 
the different aims of public and private law as well as their respective specific 
tasks and prerequisites. The special emphasis on the goal of securing compensa-
tion for the injured party210 explains why deterrence is left to other legal fields211. 
This also means that any reduction of the deterrent effect as a result of third-
party liability insurance is not bemoaned, instead above all the advantages for 
the injured party are emphasised. A logical consequence of this emphasis on the 
compensatory function is ultimately the rejection of punitive damages, whereby 
it must be pointed out in particular that there is far less need for such an instru-
ment in the European legal systems than in the USA, which has more gaps in the 
system for deterrence of damage212. The French approach of using state compen-
sation measures to ensure that almost everyone is insured against catastrophes 
has a lot to be said for it213; it neatly avoids the often seemingly arbitrary decision 
on state compensation in each individual case of catastrophe, and the victims re-
ceive compensation even when they are the only victim and therefore no catastro-
phe exists214, and moreover it means that the victims jointly bear the costs of the 
insurance.
</p>
<p>Mor&eacute;teau also shows that the principle of proportionality between legal conse-
quences and prerequisites is taken account of in many ways, not only in the law of 
damages itself215, for instance, but also in the interplay between reparative injunc-
tions, the law on unjust enrichment and compensation claims216, or in the case of 
minor infringements of personality rights that are remedied by &raquo; nominal dam-
ages &laquo; or the publication of a correction217. But Mor&eacute;teau then opines that the prin-
ciple of proportionality &raquo; may make sense in a world where most human and social 
interaction would be governed by traditional &rsaquo; Civil Code &lsaquo; mechanisms. However, 
in a complex society combining and recombining elements of private and public 
law, promoting social solidarity as a key element of the public good, pragmatic ap-
proaches tend to prevail over dogmatic views &laquo;218. In this respect it must, however,

<p>be pointed out that precisely this is the task of legal science: to work towards a cor-
rect weighting of the consequences of violations of a right and how it is handled 
according to underlying values and thus to help the fundamental standard of fair-
ness to prevail. Furthermore, the existence often emphasised in common law219 
of an opposite of pragmatic and dogmatic solutions must be rejected: on the one 
hand, it is rightly stressed that there is nothing more practical than a good theory, 
and on the other hand, it remains a completely open question what criteria should 
be used to determine the quality of practice, if reference is not to be had to dog-
matic aspects.
</p>
<p>Directly after his rather sceptical statement, Mor&eacute;teau also makes a very im-
portant remark, revealing where the decisive focus should lie in his opinion: pro-
portionality may not be examined with blinkers solely in respect of the prerequi-
sites under the law of damages and the legal consequences but also in the overall 
context of the legal system. Specifically, he states: &raquo; Yet at the end of the day, it 
seems that under French law, strict liability is often coupled with insurance, mak-
ing the tortfeasor easily liable but mitigating consequences by compulsory insur-
ance coverage, whereas fault-based liability keeps developing in areas of higher 
risks that may not be insured or insurable. It may then be said that prerequisites 
fit the legal consequences, though more investigation may be needed to check 
whether this is always the case. &laquo; Thus, Mor&eacute;teau does good service in pointing 
out that, when examining proportionality, insurability and compulsory insurance, 
inter alia, play a role since these aspects are very decisive in determining the bur-
den ultimately falling upon the injuring party in the form of a duty to compensate.
</p>
<p>In line with the different tasks ascribed to them, in Hungary220  the law dis-
tinguishes between public law and private law legal tools. In private law, in rem 
actions to have property surrendered to its owner are available, completely inde-
pendent of the law of damages and requiring no fault; in the case of other infringe-
ments, the law provides for a whole array of different instruments ranging from a 
declaration that there has been an infringement of a right to full compensation of 
the damage. Regard is had to the proportionality between legal consequence and 
prerequisites: hence, preventive injunctions and reparative injunctions do not re-
quire any fault; in the case of self-defence, the interests under threat are weighed 
up against those injured by the act of self-defence. Menyh&aacute;rd rightly criticises the 
courts&rsquo; view that claims for unjust enrichment are subsidiary in relation to com-
pensation claims, because this fails to appreciate the different functions. In ac-
cordance with the different weight of the legal consequences, claims for unjust en-
richment appropriately do not require any fault but only a wrongful interference

<p>with third-party goods. In respect of the law of damages, Menyh&aacute;rd also points out 
that in essence restoration to the previous state is striven towards and monetary 
damages are secondary221; in the case of non-pecuniary damage the difference to 
compensation of pecuniary damage by monetary payments is emphasised. Puni-
tive damages are rejected, inter alia, with the comment that penal sanctions do 
not belong in private law and deterrence is primarily the task of criminal law. So-
cial benefits supplement the law of damages and do not push this aside, as the 
injuring party is subject to recourse claims222. The hitherto recognised disgorge-
ment of profit in favour of the state is no longer provided for in the new Code; this 
is astonishing because in other legal systems this legal tool enjoys increasing pop-
ularity. However, this change only applies to the disgorgement of profit in favour 
of the state in civil proceedings, as this cannot be reconciled with the principles 
of civil proceedings. The report does not indicate whether disgorgement of profit 
continues to be available in public law and in particular in criminal proceedings.
</p>
<p>Ludwichowska-Redo223 begins chapter 2 of her report on Polish law with the fun-
damental statement: &raquo; A claim for damages offers far-reaching protection of rights 
and interests, but is also subject to strict requirements. A mere interference with 
protected interests is not enough to justify such a claim; further conditions must 
be fulfilled, such as unlawfulness and fault, or risk posed by a particular activity. 
The law of damages is, however, only one of the remedies provided by the legal sys-
tem to serve the protection of rights and interests. &laquo; Polish law clearly has regard to 
the proportionality between the gravity of the legal consequence and the weight 
of the prerequisites. Accordingly, in line with Continental European tradition, it 
includes rei vindicatio, which simply requires that the claimant has a right to the 
thing and the defendant does not; more extensive claims, such as fees for use or 
compensation, require additional prerequisites that &ndash; like in Germany &ndash; are set 
out in special provisions of the law of damages and on unjust enrichment224. Pre-
ventive injunctions also do not require fault under Polish law but simply an un-
authorised interference with a protected right225. Likewise, reparative injunctions 
and claims based on unjust enrichment set out less weighty prerequisites than 
claims for compensation226. Ludwichowska-Redo227 refers to the claim for disgorge-
ment of profit in the case of unlawful interference with a third party&rsquo;s intellectual 
property; she also advocates an expansion of the scope of this beyond the law on 
intellectual property. The Polish view is that the law of damages primarily has a

<p>compensatory function, but the function of deterrence is also recognised228; puni-
tive damages are rejected, however229. The fact that under Polish law social bene-
fits reduce the victim&rsquo;s claims for compensation but the social security body none-
theless has no recourse against the injuring party has already been mentioned 
above ( no 8 / 75 ). Victims of crime may receive compensation from the state if they 
are unable to enforce their compensation claim against the criminal; to this ex-
tent their claims are transferred to the state230. Victims of catastrophes receive 
compensation, if at all, on the basis of ad hoc rules231. There is provision for dis-
gorgement of profit in favour of the state232. It is remarkable that Polish criminal 
law also has a recognised compensatory function since a duty to compensate is 
imposed on criminals233.
</p>
<p>In the  Japanese  report234, weight is certainly accorded to the overall system 
of protection of legal goods in that the legal protection afforded by granting 
claims against the perpetrator and by punishment of the perpetrator are brought 
into context and their deterrent effect is emphasised. When it comes to grant-
ing claims, a further distinction is made between the protection against damage 
due to lawful actions ( dispossession, damage by infringements or risks permitted 
under administrative law235 ), on the one hand, and damage due to unlawful ac-
tions ( actions for preventive and reparative injunctions, unjust enrichment and 
compensation claims ), on the other hand, and the social security law protection 
mechanisms are described236. Gradation of the prerequisites in accordance with 
the gravity of the legal consequence is apparently not discussed in detail.
</p>
<p>III.  Conclusions
</p>
<p>To start with it must be noted that the Continental version of the law of damages, 
which is directed at the compensation of damage suffered, corresponds in com-
mon law only in respect of that part of the law of torts that provides for compensa-
tory damages as a remedy. The question regarding the position of the law of dam-

<p>ages governing the compensation of harm suffered within the overall framework 
of the legal system is thus different in civil and common law systems: in civil law 
this is about balancing the law of damages with other areas of law; in common law 
the torts directed at compensatory damages must, however, first be balanced in-
ternally with the torts that provide for other remedies and only then put into rela-
tion with legal fields outside the law of torts. The tasks of elaborating the different 
functions of the legal instruments and how to balance them are, however, equally 
material. Nonetheless, care must be taken not to jump to conclusions from the 
far-ranging law of torts to the significantly narrower field of the law of damages 
aimed at compensating damage; it is only those areas that provide for compensa-
tory damages that are comparable with the law of damages in civil law systems.
</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom and in the USA there are few efforts discernible to-
wards achieving a consistent overall system; this derives above all from the fact that 
the courts which are responsible for the further development of law only decide 
the respective individual case, but do not have regard to more general questions. 
This also means that any fine-tuning between the legal tools, consideration of the 
principle of proportionality between legal consequences and prerequisites and 
an appropriate interplay between the legal tools based on their consequences is 
hardly attempted at all. This is in clear contrast with Norway, where the develop-
ment of the law also largely takes place via the courts, but above all it is in contrast 
to other Continental European legal systems. In relation to such, it must also be 
noted that even in codified legal systems precisely the law of damages is an area 
in which, due to the diversity of the problems at issue, technical and social devel-
opments and the inadequate legal framework, judge-made law plays a substantial 
role in all legal systems, but nonetheless the overall system is given far more at-
tention.
</p>
<p>However, there are also further difficult issues that are material when it comes 
to the boundaries between and the interplay of different legal instruments and 
these must be clarified. Thus, it must be understood that the distinction between 
public law and private law is not a purely terminological difference but one based 
on the different tasks to be performed in both areas of law and different under-
lying values at issue237: insofar as the protection of the individual&rsquo;s interests are 
concerned, different underlying values for the relationship between the individual 
and the state as opposed to other persons of equivalent standing play a substan-
tial role; thus, the fundamental rights and civil liberties of all individuals should 
secure the free development of the personality insofar as the state is concerned. 
As regards relationships with other persons, personality rights of equal rank are at 
issue, and the scope and protection of all these rights ought to be balanced in the

<p>best manner possible. The fact that persons of basically equal rank are involved 
in private law also plays a decisive role in the applicability of the principle of mu-
tual justification238; but thus also as regards the issue of whether private law is an 
appropriate venue for awarding punitive damages that give the claimant a benefit 
that cannot be justified within the framework of private law.
</p>
<p>There is also a great need for debate in respect of the implementation of the 
principle of proportionality between legal consequence and prerequisites and there 
is certainly much persuasive work still to be done. Still, the above glance at the 
country reports has shown that the principle of proportionality is indeed taken 
into consideration when it comes to preventive and reparative injunctions, in that, 
due to the less onerous nature of the legal consequences &ndash; unlike under the law of 
damages &ndash; no fault is required. EU directives also have regard to this notion239. As-
tonishingly, however, the required distinction is neglected in the Draft Common 
Frame of Reference ( DCFR ), in that art VI.&ndash;1: 102 DCFR expressly makes enforcing 
defence rights dependent on meeting the same criteria for imputation as for com-
pensation claims.
</p>
<p>While it is increasingly accepted that claims for surrender of unjust enrichment 
must be distinguished from compensation claims due to the different legal con-
sequences240, nonetheless the elaboration of the prerequisites for such claim to 
surrender still seems to present considerable difficulties in some legal systems241. 
In other countries, however, the different prerequisites for the claims are clearly 
highlighted, for instance in France242, Poland243 and Hungary244, when it is em-
phasised that the aims and prerequisites are different and that claims based on 
unjust enrichment do not require the presence of any fault or other grounds for 
imputation but only the gaining of an advantage from assets that belong to some-
one else. The same applies in respect of the common law. Thus, it is established in 
the USA245 that it is sufficient that: &raquo; ( 1 ) the defendant received a benefit; ( 2 ) at the 
expense of the plaintiff; and ( 3 ) it would be unjust for the defendant to retain that 
benefit. The most notable distinction between restitution&rsquo;s constituent elements

<p>and those of most tort actions is that a plaintiff need not prove wrongdoing on the 
part of the defendant. &laquo; The fact that in contrast to the law of damages no wrong-
doing is required, ie neither fault nor any breach of a duty of care, is in line with 
the recognition that a less onerous legal consequence is at stake: disgorging an 
inadmissibly attained benefit is less onerous for the person who must surrender 
it than it is for a liable party to use his own assets to remedy a third party&rsquo;s loss246.
</p>
<p>The country reports &ndash; completely in line with the aim of this investigation &ndash; do 
not provide a sufficient basis to sketch an overall system of all legal instruments 
available when it comes to threatening or already manifest interferences with pro-
tected interests. Particular groups of claims, such as those for disgorgement of 
profit ( below no 8 / 172 ) or punitive damages ( no 8 / 174 ) will, however, be addressed 
in the course of the discussion below.
</p>
<p>At this point, it must be noted that the  transfer  of  ideas  is by no means in-
tended as a one-way system from Continental European civil law systems to com-
mon law. It should never be overlooked that the codified overall systems of today 
are still far short of persuasive power as to date no really consistent, balanced 
overall system can by any means be offered. On the other hand, as already men-
tioned, it must also be accepted that in the codified legal systems too much focus 
is given to general rules while in individual cases insufficient regard may be given 
to the specific features. Therefore, it is still necessary to take into consideration 
the doubting, critical assessments given by the representatives of common law as 
regards the present-day overall systems and to have proof that a consistent system 
is not only necessary in order to work towards the aim of justice but also feasi-
ble. On the other hand, this also requires common law lawyers to be open about 
the deficits of their system247. If both sides are willing to learn and are sufficiently 
ready to make compromises, I believe this task is indeed feasible, to the benefit of 
both presently juxtaposed models. The ideal would appear to be a combination of 
general, elastic rules that refer to the material criteria for value judgements with 
sufficiently wide room for the courts to manoeuvre in implementing these general 
guidelines248.

<p>I.  Compensatory function and deterrence function
</p>
<p>A.  Comparative law review
</p>
<p>1.  The Continental European legal systems and Japan
It is an acknowledged fact that the Continental European law of damages primar-
ily has a compensatory function &ndash; this is the case with respect to the German legal 
family, France249, Norway  250, Poland251, Hungary  252 and also other countries  253; the 
same is true of Japan254. This is frequently apparent from the statutory regulation, 
which is founded on the compensation of damage caused in a manner that is im-
putable to the liable party. Besides this, Weinrib  255 points out that restricting the 
legal consequence to compensation of the damage inflicted upon the victim cor-
responds with the principle of commutative justice. When it comes to compensat-
ing non-pecuniary damage, however, the notion of satisfaction256 plays a role in 
some legal systems, for example sometimes still in Germany257.

tory function of compensation for non-pecuniary damage and considers that the debate on the 
satisfaction function is obsolete.

</p>
<p>By contrast, in Continental European countries the notion of deterrence258, as 
an aim of the law of damages259, is sometimes accorded no importance260 and pre-
dominantly ascribed merely secondary significance in that the threat of having 
to compensate exerts a certain, general deterrent effect261; this is the prevailing 
opinion in Japan too262. The primary implementation of the deterrence notion is 
left to public law, above all criminal law; thus, compensation payments under the 
law of damages are limited to the full redress of the damage sustained263. The no-
tion of continuation of a right ( Rechtsfortsetzungsgedanke )264, which can be inter-
preted as an expression of the notion of deterrence and which leads to a minimum 
compensation of the market value ( objective value ), is sometimes implicitly265 and 
sometimes explicitly266 recognised.
</p>
<p>2.  Fundamental differences between common law and Continental 
European legal systems
</p>
<p>Oliphant267 cites compensation as the commonly acknowledged aim of the law of 
damages and adds: &raquo; but there is some slippage between two distinct conceptions: 
first, that tort law should be evaluated by its ability to compensate for all injuries; 
secondly, that tort law aims at compensation as part of a regime of corrective jus-
tice &laquo;. Oliphant then emphasises: &raquo; Nowadays, compensation is most often thought 
of in the latter terms, which evidently leaves open the crucial question of when, 
and for what harms, one person is fairly accountable in tort law to another. &laquo; In

<p>258 On the concept and types of deterrence see Tich&yacute;, On Prevention in Law: Special Focus on Tort 
Law, in: Tich&yacute; / Hr&aacute;dek ( eds ), Prevention 9.
</p>
<p>259 When it is emphasised in Basic Questions I, no 1 / 7 that &raquo; it is important not to lose sight of the 
primary aim of the legal system, ie prevention of damage &laquo;, this does not mean that the primary 
function of the law of damages is seen as being deterrence but that the legal system should pri-
marily strive towards preventing damage and thus the need to apply the law of damages; the 
compensation of the harm that has already occurred is more or less a damage management so-
lution when prevention has failed ( see also above no 8 / 77 ). Insofar there has been a misunder-
standing by Green / Cardi, USA no 6 / 17 when they try to deduce a primary function of deterrence 
for the law of damages from these statements, which would be in complete contradiction of 
the statements in Basic Questions I, no 3 / 1 ff.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>comparison, Green / Cardi268 clearly have the former meaning in mind when they 
write: &raquo; An American tort observer would surely acknowledge that deterrence is 
not the sole aim of tort law. But surely compensation is not the sole aim of tort 
law, otherwise an injured person would be able to recover compensation from any 
deep pocket that the victim could find. &laquo;
</p>
<p>There is a misunderstanding on this latter point if this was intended to refer 
to the Continental European, codified legal systems; clearly I have not yet man-
aged to clarify this well enough and my previous attempts were in vain269: if the 
criticism of the material nature of the notion of compensation is based on how 
damage is by no means always recoverable and that the principle of compensation 
can offer little help when it comes to answering the question of what conditions 
must be fulfilled before compensation must be rendered, the notion of compen-
sation is being ascribed absolutely the wrong task, at least in respect of the Con-
tinental European legal systems. The notion of the compensation function is not 
aimed at providing insights into the grounds for imputation but simply at estab-
lishing what the compensation claim should fulfil if and when the grounds for im-
putation are given. In any case, the notion of compensation expresses the aim of 
the Continental European law of damages, which is homogenous in this respect, 
and thus can provide orientation for how such claim should be constituted ( eg 
natural restitution or monetary damages ), and at least provides a guideline for 
the extent of the compensation claim and thus precludes the possibility, eg, of dis-
gorgement of profit in the framework of the law of damages or the imposition of 
penalty payments. Under which conditions this compensation should be required 
can only be determined taking into consideration commutative and distributive 
justice270 and therefore having regard to a multitude of grounds for imputation.
</p>
<p>It must also be noted, however, that the fundamental notion of commuta-
tive justice points to compensation, as is also emphasised by Oliphant271 when he 
writes: &raquo; Tort law embodies the principle of corrective justice: one who wrongfully 
causes another harm should correct that injustice by the payment of compensa-
tion. &laquo;
</p>
<p>In this context, the objection made by Green / Cardi certainly has a point as re-
gards the common law272: while the Continental European law of damages is a ho-
mogenous area as regards the basic prerequisites and the legal consequences that 
cover all rules that govern the prerequisites and content of the claims directed at

</p>
<p>the compensation of damage, common law proceeds on the basis of a multitude 
of &raquo; torts &laquo; with different prerequisites, in which respect moreover it must always 
be asked which legal consequences would apply if the external elements of the 
tort are fulfilled. It must be borne in mind &ndash; as already mentioned in no 8 / 29 &ndash; that 
by no means do all torts require the occurrence of damage and neither are they 
based on any uniform concept of &raquo; damage &laquo;, but instead about 70 &raquo; conceptions of 
damage &laquo; come into play273. Moreover, while the usual legal consequence is &raquo; dam-
ages &laquo;, this is nonetheless not always the case, and finally &ndash; again in contrast to 
Continental European laws of damages &ndash; the different types of damages are by 
no means always aimed at compensating damage, so that the legal consequences 
may be extremely various. The &raquo; law of torts &laquo; is therefore an extremely inhomoge-
neous field of law274.
</p>
<p>If then in the case of torts actionable per se, there is no requirement that 
damage has occurred, this in itself shows that the law of torts is not always di-
rected at compensating damage, hence a compensatory function cannot always 
be ascribed to the law of torts. It must be added that the law of torts also pro-
vides for preventive injunctions that apply before damage is sustained and hence 
cannot serve the aim of compensation of damage either, but only of prevention. 
The conclusion that the law of torts is by no means consistently based on the 
notion of compensation is supported by a glance at the different types of dam-
ages275. Rogers276 emphasises that sometimes an obligation &raquo; to disgorge the prof-
its &laquo; is imposed, something which is regulated under the law of unjust enrichment 
in other legal systems, and he further highlights that if exemplary damages ( pu-
nitive damages ) are awarded in addition to the &raquo; compensatory damages &laquo;, this de-
parts entirely from the notion of compensation and puts a penal function in the 
foreground. Finally, he points out that in some cases, eg &raquo; trespass to land &laquo;, only 
&raquo; a method of obtaining a declaration of rights &laquo; is at issue, ie a simple finding of 
a legal infringement, and mentions that in this context there is reference to the 
&raquo; ombudsman function &laquo; of the law of torts. Thus, only compensatory damages are 
aimed at the redress of damage sustained.
</p>
<p>Hence, it is only that part of the law of torts which provides for compensatory 
damages that corresponds to the Continental European law of damages; this is, 
nonetheless, the substantial part. In respect of this part then, it can indeed be said

</p>
<p>that the primary aim here too is the compensation of damage. Besides this, how-
ever, the general deterrent effect is also highlighted, though apparently reference 
is frequently made not to deterrence but to &raquo; social control &laquo;277.
</p>
<p>Insofar as punitive or exemplary damages are awarded, on the other hand, 
this is primarily about deterrence; whereas in the case of other heads of damages 
other aims take precedence.
</p>
<p>B.  Conclusions
</p>
<p>1.  Limitation of the comparative law discussion to  
the law concerning compensating damage
</p>
<p>Thus, it has been shown that the debates start from different premises. When the 
law of damages is discussed in Continental European legal systems, this refers to 
a group of rules according to which, when the basic prerequisite of causation of 
damage and more or less generally defined other grounds for imputation, in par-
ticular fault liability, vicarious liability and strict liability, have been met, a certain 
type of legal consequence, namely the compensation of damage is stipulated ( see 
&sect; 823 para 1 of the German Civil Code, BGB ). Insofar, this is a homogenous legal 
field in relation to the basic prerequisites and the legal consequence: the law of 
damages includes all rules that govern the prerequisites and content of claims di-
rected at the compensation of damage.
</p>
<p>In the  common  law, on the other hand, the starting premise is a multitude 
of &raquo; torts &laquo; that set out different prerequisites thus giving rise to the question of 
which legal consequences &ndash; which do not always consist in compensation of dam-
age &ndash; are provided for ( see above no 8 / 29 and no 121 ff ). This is compounded by a 
far-ranging isolation of the &raquo; law of torts &laquo; from other legal fields, which does not 
serve to improve the overview of interrelationships and differences in function, 
for example between public law, criminal law and the law of damages. The ap-
parently inadequate fulfilment of the need for deterrence via the criminal law in 
common law countries; the deficits in the development of the law on unjust en-
richment; the hesitance with respect to compensating non-pecuniary damage; the 
hindrance of full compensation even for successful claimants as a result of the 
idiosyncrasies of procedural law; and undoubtedly several other reasons mean, 
moreover, that the &raquo; law of torts &laquo; is reverted to as a stop-gap and thus a clear delin-
eation of its tasks as well as proportionality between the legal consequences and 
the relevant prerequisites seem hardly possible.

</p>
<p>2.  Consequences in relation to  
&raquo; punitive damages &laquo;
</p>
<p>The different starting points in civil law and common law systems make extra 
caution necessary when comparing Continental European laws on damages and 
the law of torts in the common law. Thus, the law of damages in civil law jurisdic-
tions can only be compared and therefore be open to harmonisation with that &ndash; ad-
mittedly very substantial &ndash; part of the law of torts in common law that provides 
for compensatory damages as the legal consequence and, accordingly, follows the 
principle of compensation. Insofar, however, as remedies are primarily directed at 
deterrence, they cannot in principle fall into the same category as the law of dam-
ages in Continental European legal systems.
</p>
<p>It must be highlighted here, however, that even in common law,  punitive 
damages meet with rejection when basic principles are considered. Thus, Wein-
rib278  emphasises that punitive damages contravene the tenet of corrective jus-
tice, though his arguments are largely in line with the argumentation invoking the 
necessity of mutual justification279. Weinrib points out that punitive damages are 
inconsistent with corrective justice for reasons both of structure and of content. 
As to structure, he underlines that corrective justice requires that the normative 
considerations applicable to the relationship between defendant and plaintiff re-
flect the parties&rsquo; correlative standing as sufferer of and doer of the same injustice. 
Therefore, it excludes considerations that refer to one of the parties without en-
compassing the correlative situation of the other. &raquo; The standard justifications for 
punitive damages &ndash; deterrence and retribution &ndash; are one-sided considerations that 
focus not relationally on the parties as doer and sufferer of the same injustice, but 
unilaterally on the defendant &hellip; as doer. The place of such considerations is not 
private law but criminal law, because criminal law is concerned not with whether 
the accused has injured someone&rsquo;s particular right, but with whether the accused 
has acted inconsistently with the existence of a regime of rights in general. &laquo; So far 
as content is concerned, Weinrib elaborates that &raquo; punitive damages are inconsist-
ent with the role of rights in corrective justice. Punitive damages do not restore 
to plaintiffs what is rightfully theirs, but instead give them a windfall. &laquo; According 
to Weinrib, punitive damages based on deterrence and retribution thus violate the 
limitation thesis that the remedy should only restore the plaintiff&rsquo;s right and not 
give the plaintiff more than that right or its equivalent280.

</p>
<p>3.  Consequences relating to the influence of  
private law on behaviour
</p>
<p>In more recent times it is increasingly being advocated that private law be drawn 
on as the means to enforce rules281, whereby above all the deterrent effect of the law 
of damages should be exploited. Firstly, the discussion focused on the influence 
exerted by private law on markets in respect of the legal fields of unfair competi-
tion and antitrust, for which there have been strong impulses from the European 
Union282. The basic idea is the mobilisation of citizens, in particular consumers, 
to enforce rules by granting them private law claims in the case of misconduct by 
companies. The idea is that the costs caused when a large number of people as-
sert claims will act as a steering mechanism, particularly effective in the commer-
cial context. The crux is that not only are the side-effects of the claims that already 
exist under general rules at work but also that beyond this a basis is created in 
the public interest for further claims that do not primarily, or at least do not only, 
serve the protection of the individual interests of those bringing claims.
</p>
<p>This can in particular mean that pure economic interests of the victims of un-
fair competition or antitrust law infringements are protected far more extensively 
than otherwise. This can be justified by arguing that it no longer appears appro-
priate or reasonable for the injuring party to be protected against the opening of 
the floodgates of compensation duties due to the impairment of pure economic 
interests in this context: the potential injuring parties are not burdened by addi-
tional duties to behave in a certain way to avoid injuring someone; rather the duty 
to compensate the victim is linked to the infringement of already existing duties 
to act in a certain way in order to protect others and ultimately the market. Fur-
ther, the injuring parties are only burdened with the duty to compensate for pure 
economic damage within a relatively narrow scope, ie where there is substantial 
public interest to compensate. It must be emphasised that this increased protec-
tion of individual interests due to the enforcement of public interests does not 
conflict in any way in principle with the standard of mutual justification of private 
law claims: on the one hand, those entitled to compensation have really suffered 
damage and the redressing of such is objectively absolutely justifiable since in-
terests recognised by the legal system have been injured; on the other hand, it no

</p>
<p>long appears appropriate to protect the injuring parties against being burdened 
with having to compensate pure economic interests as they have in any case acted 
unlawfully and the weight of the public interest in the values at issue also has an 
impact.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, concerns must be expressed if it is inferred that because there 
are often deficits in enforcement when it comes to &raquo; scattered damage &laquo; ( widespread, 
small losses ), such claims must exceed compensation in order to have corrective 
influence on behaviour283. It must be emphasised that awarding such increased 
amounts exceeding the compensation of the individual claimant&rsquo;s damage breaks 
with the principle of mutual justification284. Just as awarding punitive amounts go-
ing beyond compensation cannot be justified in private law, neither can awarding 
amounts exceeding compensation be justified by the notion of deterrence. The 
claimant has no entitlement whatsoever to receive such amounts. Neither is it pos-
sible even to guess during the case of the first claimant which amounts should then 
be payable on grounds of deterrence as it cannot be foreseen how many claimants 
in total will assert claims and which deficits in enforcement will ultimately arise. 
Moreover, it must be borne in mind that illogical consequences result if the first 
claimant receives a significantly increased sum but subsequent claimants do not.
</p>
<p>Therefore, caution must be exercised in order to avoid any undifferentiated 
&raquo; monoculture &laquo; which, at all costs, seeks to accomplish all goals via the law of dam-
ages; the remedy for such deficits in enforcement must therefore be sought by 
other means, for example via disgorgement of profits285 or via claims brought by 
associations ( Verbandsklagen )286. Furthermore, it must be remembered that there 
are no such concerns regarding preventive and reparative injunctions as these do 
not bestow any unjustified benefit upon the claimant.
</p>
<p>4.  Deterrence by compensation of damage
</p>
<p>It must be underlined that all the arguments against the deterrent function of 
&raquo; Schadenersatzrecht &laquo; &ndash; the law of compensation &ndash; in the Continental European 
sense are directed solely against the idea of a primary or even only deterrent func-

</p>
<p>tion, but not against a secondary function287: as already mentioned, it is broadly ac-
cepted that tort law also &ndash; as a side effect &ndash; has a deterrent function. The threat of 
a duty to compensate in the event of damage being caused undoubtedly provides 
a general incentive to avoid inflicting damage. With respect to the specific tortfeasor 
who has already caused harm and thus been held liable for compensation, it pro-
vides motivation to avoid causing damage as far as possible in future.
</p>
<p>The deterrent function further founds the basis of the idea of continuation 
or continuing effect of a right or interest288 which is thought to provide affirma-
tion for the objective-abstract assessment of damage. Specifically, the notion of con-
tinuation of a right sees the injured right or legal good as surviving in a claim for 
compensation: in lieu of the destroyed good, a claim against the damaging party 
arises. As the legal system protects rights and legal goods based on their general 
appreciation in the legal community, the notion of continuation of a right leads 
to a claim for compensation for the &raquo; ordinary value &laquo;, ie the market value, regard-
less of the concrete interest of the owner who suffered the loss. Thus, the notion of 
continuation of a right secures the emergence of a duty to compensate289 provided 
the other relevant criteria for imputation are satisfied and by this ensures that: 
the damaging party must compensate as minimum damage the objective-abstract 
value loss, at least if the destroyed or damaged good enjoyed general appreciation, 
and even if the subjective damage is less or the damage has been shifted. This 
safeguarding of the duty to compensate reinforces the incentive to avoid inflict-
ing damage.
</p>
<p>I think that these ideas should be taken up in the discussions on future har-
monisation. This has already been done by the European Group on Tort Law 
and its considerations manifested themselves in art 10: 201 PETL: &raquo; Such damage 
is generally determined as concretely as possible but it may be determined ab-
stractly when appropriate, for example by reference to a market value. &laquo;

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>third-party liability insurance is the fact that it at least considerably impedes the 
deterrent secondary-function of the law of tort, possibly even eliminates it291, as far 
as the insurance provides cover for the compensation: it can be assumed that the 
incentive to avoid causing damage is lower the less that the injuring party will be 
burdened with the duty to compensate. If someone has third-party liability insur-
ance, liability to pay damages will hardly affect him financially, as far as liability 
for negligent conduct and strict liability is at stake.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these arguments should not be interpreted as a call to prohibit 
third-party liability insurance as much as possible. It must be taken into consid-
eration that even in the absence of third-party liability insurance, there may be no 
deterrent effect. For example, if the impending duty to compensate constitutes 
no burden to the injuring party due to his wealth; or alternatively if he will not be 
in any position to fulfil his duty to compensate anyway because he has no assets. 
Moreover, the positive aspect of third-party liability insurance in relation also to 
the victim must not be overlooked292: third-party liability insurance serves the in-
terests of victims as it secures the compensation payments; hence, it serves the 
compensatory and thus the primary function of the law of tort293. Third-party li-
ability insurance is therefore highly desirable and in many cases even prescribed 
as compulsory for this reason294, particularly in the context of motor vehicle liabil-
ity. It must also be borne in mind that third-party liability insurance is absolutely 
essential for entrepreneurs in order to facilitate the calculation of risks.
</p>
<p>Thus, it may be said that third-party liability insurance promotes the compen-
satory function &ndash; which is primary to the law of tort &ndash; but is detrimental to the an-
cillary deterrent purpose. This negative aspect can and should, however, certainly 
be mitigated and therefore third-party liability insurance should, as far as possi-
ble, be designed so as not to undermine the deterrent function of the law of tort. 
This could be achieved, inter alia, by means of deductibles and premiums deter-
mined by the bonus-malus system295.

</p>
<p>6.  A need for additional instruments of deterrence ?
</p>
<p>It is often bemoaned that tort law does not have a sufficiently deterring effect be-
cause, even after fulfilling his compensation duties, the tortfeasor still retains a 
benefit as a result of his unlawful interference. In particular in respect of infringe-
ments of intellectual property296, the further difficulty of proving the extent of 
the damage, the inadequate enforceability of compensation claims and thus the 
shortcomings of tort law are criticised297. In the case of &raquo; scattered &laquo; damage or very 
minor damage, the complaint is that there is, moreover, not enough incentive for 
the victim to pursue his compensation claims with the result that the tortfeasor 
largely escapes his duties to compensate and as a result of this enforcement defi-
cit the deterrent effect is lost298. Ultimately, the substantial decrease in the deter-
rent effect of having to pay compensation due to third-party liability insurance299 
is pointed out.
</p>
<p>The argument that tort law often cannot fulfil all legitimate expectations &ndash; in 
particular in relation to a powerful deterrent effect &ndash; cannot be completely denied. 
However, it must be remembered that some expectations far exceed what tort law 
is either intended to or can achieve given its fundamental conceptions and its 
aims, and it must be noted that Continental European legal systems provide for a 
myriad of other legal instruments apart from the law of damages, with different func-
tions and thus additional deterrent effects300. Hence, before we can speak of defi-
cits in regulation, we must firstly take account of the limits inherent in the law of 
damages, and secondly the interplay of all the other instruments. The law of dam-
ages after all is only one of many protective mechanisms in the overall framework 
of our legal systems; therefore, it should and can only cover a part of the required 
protection of interests. There is clearly not enough awareness of the importance 
of a general overview in particular in the common law, as a result of the isolated 
analysis of the law of torts; but even in Continental Europe it is often neglected.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>In fact legal systems have a whole arsenal of very different weapons available 
under private, administrative and criminal law to serve the protection of rights and in-
terests in very different ways: by defending such against threatened endangerment, 
by compensating losses, by returning unjust enrichment, by disgorgement of profits 
in favour of the public purse or by the imposition of penalties for infringements at-
tempted or committed301. With regard to prevention, the following have to be men-
tioned in particular: preventive injunctions302, the right to self-defence and repara-
tive injunctions which also help to hinder the occurrence of further harm303. Last but 
not least, reference is made to the fact that the aim of deterrence &ndash; independently 
of the notion of compensation &ndash; is also pursued above all by criminal law; hence, 
private law measures should never be viewed in isolation. This must be borne in 
mind, for example, when supporters of the economic analysis of law304 complain 
that killing a person does not involve any consequences under tort law305 unless 
there are surviving dependants to whom the deceased had a duty to make mainte-
nance payments: in reality &ndash; when the overall legal system is taken into account &ndash; 
there is no gap in protection as criminal law comprehensively protects human life306.
</p>
<p>As far as deficits in enforcement are concerned when it comes to &raquo; scattered &laquo; 
or very minor damage, effective tools have been created in some legal systems, at 
least for special areas in which the shortcomings of the law of damages were par-
ticularly noticeable. These approaches are based on ideas that are capable of be-
ing generalised beyond their existing application to other situations. Particularly 
worthy of attention is an association&rsquo;s claim for disgorgement of profits introduced 
by &sect; 10 of the Unfair Competition Act ( UWG ) in 2004 in Germany307; this revolu-

<p>758 Helmut&emsp;Koziol&emsp; &emsp; Comparative conclusions
</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>tionary provision was followed somewhat later by &sect; 34 a of the German Act against 
restraints on Competition ( GWB )308. Under these provisions it is possible for cer-
tain consumer protection associations to sue those who engage in certain inad-
missible business practices intentionally and in this manner gain a profit at the 
expense of a multitude of customers for disgorgement of this profit in favour of 
the public purse. It must be noted that the legislator rightly took into account 
that these claims are not about enforcing individuals&rsquo; interests but have an overall 
regulatory effect for society309, and thus the amounts disgorged cannot be allowed 
to flow to individuals. Therefore, in harmony with the applicable principle of mu-
tual justification in private law, this law avoids handing out objectively unjustified 
windfalls to individuals but ensures that their damage is compensated.
</p>
<p>For a more general rule obviously some corrections would need to be made310. 
For example, the restriction to intentional behaviour is not justifiable when it 
comes to claims for unjust enrichment, rather these should be granted in the 
case of any interference in interests that are comprehensively protected or at least 
protected against certain types of behaviour. The association&rsquo;s claim should be ex-
panded in the case of &raquo; scattered &laquo; or very minor damage and thus apply also in 
line with the general rules. It should also apply in the case of negligent behaviour 
or when there is strict liability. Offering associations greater incentives to bring 
lawsuits should also be considered, for instance by making a greater part of the 
amount in question available to them for further relevant activities.
</p>
<p>If there is still a need for further sanctions after this, then &ndash; due to the private 
law principle of mutual justification &ndash; an extension of the criminal law and also 
administrative penal law must be considered first. Insofar as there are legitimate 
concerns about over-burdening the criminal and administrative courts,  interim 
solutions between private and criminal law could be considered, taking account 
of both the structural principles of private law and also of criminal law. Therefore, 
such would have to avoid infringing the principle of mutual justification and thus 
also any unjustifiable windfall to the claimant311, by giving private associations the 
standing to make a claim like in the disgorgement of profit action under &sect; 10 of 
the German Act on Unfair Competition ( UWG ) as well as under &sect; 34 a of the Ger-
man Act against restraints on Competition ( GWB ) but also in accordance with 
other European models312 and having the fines paid out to the state, social insti-

not compensation or disgorgement of profit, however, it would also be necessary 
to make sure in such proceedings that the procedural principles of criminal law, 
which serve the protection of the accused, are observed; moreover, regard would 
have to be had to the principle that, in criminal law, sanctions can only be im-
posed on the basis of explicit provisions, so that any drawing of analogies would 
be problematic.

<p>II.  Economic optimisation
</p>
<p>The country reports do not ascribe decisive importance to the economic analysis 
of law, at most the results of such are given joint consideration with other aspects. 
In France it is highlighted that the view &raquo; that figures cannot explain everything, 
that reality cannot be reduced to mathematical formulae is a good reflection of 
French skepticism: the law and economics creed that human activity is driven 
by maximisation of wealth is oversimplistic and cannot explain everything. It is 
either ignored or rejected by most scholars &laquo;314. In respect of Norway, in turn, it is 
noted that: &raquo; The prevailing view seems to be that law and economics operates with 
oversimple and general presuppositions and that the rationality does not capture 
the moral questions that are inherent in tort law. Still, in certain areas the insights 
of economics can no doubt be helpful; however, not as a replacement for tort law 
but only as a supplement to tort law reasoning &laquo;315. This corresponds largely to 
the Hungarian standpoint316. Very much in the same direction ultimately comes  
Oliphant&rsquo;s  statement317:  &raquo; modern law and economics has not gained much of a 
foothold amongst tort lawyers in England or elsewhere in the Commonwealth. &laquo;
</p>
<p>Green / Cardi318 write that the sole validity of economic analysis is hardly sup-
ported in their home country any more either; instead a law and economics 
analysis tends to proceed along the lines that: &raquo; if we wish to take efficiency into 
account, this is how the law might be structured. &laquo; However, they stress the impor-
tance of economic analysis in relation to its emphasis on the notion of deterrence.  
</p>
<p>313 Cf Ben-Shahar, Causation and Foreseeability, in: Faure ( ed ), Tort Law and Economics 99 f, who 
clearly wants to provide for this very generally in cases in which the payment exceeds the ac-
tual damage.

<p>Conclusions: Apart from the energetic minority in Germany, all legal systems 
covered seem to support moderate joint consideration of economic aspects but to 
reject their sole applicability. This seems a perfectly appropriate approach, avoid-
ing any monocultures319, which could meet with general approval.

<p> Part 4  The area between tort and breach of  
an obligation
</p>
<p>I.  Comparative law overview
</p>
<p>Delictual liability is often compared to  contractual  liability. This distinction is 
common in all the legal systems discussed here and is also highly significant320: 
contractual liability is much more wide-ranging than delictual as it either pro-
vides for a reversal of the burden of proof in relation to fault or even for liability 
independent of fault; many legal systems provide for a more extensive liability 
for auxiliaries in the contractual area than in the delictual and finally contractual 
rules usually allow the recovery of pure economic damage. Nevertheless, special 
attention is rarely given to the reasons behind the different structures or to the 
boundaries between the two321.
</p>
<p>As the comparative law overview shows culpa in contrahendo, ie the infringe-
ment of pre-contractual duties to protect the others&rsquo; interests, is often given a spe-
cial position322 with the compensation of pure economic damage being accepted; 
predominantly, however, pre-contractual infringements are counted as delicts323 
and any other interim stages or transitions are not elaborated but instead specific 
groups of cases are assigned solutions under the law of contracts or delicts with-
out any regard to the bigger context324. There are also differences insofar as some 
jurisdictions allow the claimant to choose between actions under contractual and 
delictual law325, in particular in France any accumulation of claims is rejected326. 
In Poland, as in the German legal family, the two types of claim are very different

</p>
<p>when it comes to distribution of the burden of proof, the recoverable damage and 
liability for auxiliaries, and sometimes also in respect of prescription327.
</p>
<p>Neither is the position in the USA so different: Green / Cardi328 note that tort 
law and contract law are treated as distinct subjects in US law and that American 
lawyers would not contrast and compare the obligations imposed by tort and con-
tract. &raquo; Rather, the US legal system considers tort obligations to be ones imposed 
by law to address relations among strangers. By contrast, contractual obligations 
are matters of voluntary agreement that arise from that agreement. &laquo; In stating 
this, however, the US report does not take into consideration that the obligations 
imposed on the parties to compensate the damage caused to the other are not pre-
dominantly based on a concrete agreement of the parties but on law; only in a few 
cases do parties design provisions on liability.
</p>
<p>Green / Cardi further point out that US law also encounters cases in which both 
tort law and contract law could apply. Product liability and medical malpractice 
are such important areas. For historical reasons, in the US, professional malprac-
tice is governed by tort law and is not a matter for contract law. On the other hand, 
in product liability, a victim may assert either tort claims or warranty claims.
</p>
<p>II.  Opinion
</p>
<p>In order to better understand the relationship between contractual and delictual 
liability, it is necessary to look more closely at the core areas in both types of li-
ability, their delineation, the material principles behind them and thus also the 
significance of the distinction between the two fields of liability329.
</p>
<p>A clear part of the core area of contractual liability is constituted by infringe-
ments of the duty to render performance. In this context the notion of guarantee &ndash; 
more strongly developed in common law330, in France in the form of the &raquo; obliga-
tion de r&eacute;sultat &laquo;331 and also in the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods ( CISG )332 &ndash; plays a role333: if the obligee undertakes to

</p>
<p>render some particular performance, even in legal systems that do not proceed 
on the basis of a guarantee undertaking, this is nonetheless seen as a type of rec-
ognition of the ability to perform, which admittedly does not have the power to 
trigger liability based on guarantee and independent of fault but does allow the 
assumption that non-performance is attributable to misconduct on the part of 
the obligee; the obligee, who does not render the promised performance, must 
thus prove that he has not breached any duty of care. In this respect, contractual 
liability is stricter than delictual. Besides this, it must be remembered that in the 
case of contractual relationships, each partner exposes his sphere more openly to 
the possible influence of the other and thus is exposed to increased risk towards 
his person and legal goods. Some legal systems hold that this increase in risk may 
lead to a tightening of liability by introducing a presumption of fault.
</p>
<p>Moreover, this risk posed to the other in the context of contractual relation-
ships aimed at exchanging performance occurs in the pursuance of each partner&rsquo;s 
own business interest. If a party is exposed to greater risk by pursuance of anoth-
er&rsquo;s business interests, increased duties of care are reasonable and these also lie 
in both parties&rsquo; interest to minimise damage as far as possible. Therefore, firstly, 
an increased standard of care, secondly, duties to take action, and thirdly a duty 
to have regard to the pure economic interests of the other may be imposed on 
each contractual partner334. In particular the more extensive contractual liability 
for pure economic loss is extremely important in practice.
</p>
<p>In those legal systems that do not have comprehensive liability in the delictual 
area for principals in respect of their auxiliaries335, such liability is stricter within 
contractual relationships: whoever can and may increase his economic benefit 
and economic potential by using auxiliaries also ought to bear the losses associ-
ated with using these auxiliaries. It must also be borne in mind that the position 
of the obligor would be considerably weaker as a result of auxiliaries being used 
if the obligee was only liable in the case of fault in selection or supervision of the 
auxiliaries. The auxiliaries, who are not bound by the contractual obligations, are 
only subject to the general delictual liability336.
</p>
<p>In some legal systems, classification under contractual or delictual liability 
has a considerable practical impact because different rules on prescription come 
into play337.
</p>
<p>Although strictly speaking there is only a breach of contract when &ndash; privately 
and autonomously agreed &ndash; duties to perform are not discharged, there is a strong

</p>
<p>tendency, in particular in the German-speaking jurisdictions but also in France to 
some extent338, to apply contractual rules, which are much more favourable to the 
victim, even when the protection of the legal goods of the partner and thus his In-
tegrit&auml;tsinteressen ( interests in integrity ) are at stake. A good example is provided 
by cases of culpa in contrahendo, ie the infringement of pre-contractual duties of 
care, including special duties of care established by business contact. Although 
no contract has yet been concluded, far-reaching duties of care are assumed be-
tween the partners and when these are infringed, the rules of contractual liability 
are applied, in particular in relation to extensive liability for auxiliaries and for 
pure economic loss. As already mentioned, in the majority of legal systems, cases 
of culpa in contrahendo are assigned to the delictual field but accorded a special 
status. Whether in such cases they are discussed under contractual or delictual li-
ability or under an interim area is more a question of terminology. In essence the 
issue is the recognition that general delictual liability339, which is relevant when 
it comes to compensating the infringement of the  Integrit&auml;tsinteressen,  can be 
equated with or approximated to contractual liability when the material factors 
behind the stricter nature of contractual liability are equally or partially relevant 
in this context.
</p>
<p>A further example relevant in practice is offered by prospectus liability on the 
part of the party that draws up a prospectus in relation to the addressees, who usu-
ally are not contractual partners of the former. Nonetheless, far-ranging liability 
for pure economic loss and the application of the contractual rules on liability for 
auxiliaries, in particular, are endorsed. The reason behind this is that the party 
responsible for the prospectus presents himself as an expert in the matter and di-
rects his representations in his own interest at interested third parties whose trust 
and reliance he wishes to procure in order to influence how they act. Thus, pro-
spectus liability is a sub-category of liability for breach of trust or reliance, which 
covers constellations of interests which come close to those when contracts are 
concluded340.
</p>
<p>In my opinion the above-described interim area between contractual and de-
lictual liability or &ndash; put differently &ndash; the legitimate way in which some cases of 
delictual liability can be approximated to contractual liability should not present 
any impossible obstacles, at least not in Europe, to harmonisation of the various 
positions. On the one hand, there has not yet been any really comprehensive dis-

<p>cussion in most legal systems to date but, accordingly, neither have any clear po-
sitions been firmly established. On the other hand, there is, generally speaking, 
adequate flexibility for objectively satisfactory solutions in the interim area at is-
sue: in any case the legal systems often already base decisions in this context on 
the above-mentioned factors, which are those which support the idea of tighter li-
ability under contracts than with respect to normal delictual liability. When estab-
lishing the duties of care, for instance, the basis is often a particularly close rela-
tionship and the degree of endangerment; compensation for pure economic loss 
is awarded under consideration of various different factors, whereby, inter alia, 
procuring trust in declarations is significant; departures from the basic burden 
of proof rule are often allowed or in essence allowed by admitting prima facie evi-
dence. There are differences with respect to liability for auxiliaries in the contrac-
tual and delictual areas only in some legal systems, so that no general problem is 
presented here; however, in the legal systems that do distinguish in this respect it 
would be necessary to work out exceptions in some cases.</p>

<p> Part 5  The basic criteria for a compensation claim
</p>
<p>I.  Damage
</p>
<p>A.  Comparative review
</p>
<p>When reference is made in the German speaking legal systems to the law of dam-
ages, it is clear that this means the field of rules that provide for the compensa-
tion of damage sustained where the basic prerequisite consisting in causation of 
the damage as well as more or less generally defined grounds for imputation, in 
particular fault liability, vicarious liability and strict liability, have been met ( see 
&sect; 823 para 1 of the German Civil Code, BGB, &sect; 1295 para 1 of the Austrian Civil 
Code, ABGB, art 41 para 1 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, OR )341. This is in line 
with the emphasis on the notion of compensation in these countries342. As this 
field always concerns a homogenous legal consequence with fixed content, spe-
cifically the compensation of damage caused, from the point of view of the basic 
prerequisite &ndash; causation of harm &ndash; and the legal consequence &ndash; compensation of 
said harm &ndash; this is a very homogenous field of law: the law of damages covers all 
those rules that govern the prerequisites for and content of the claims directed at 
compensation of damage. The same is true too of the other Continental European 
legal systems that have likewise developed the law of damages as a separate legal 
institution, directed at the compensation of damage sustained343. In all these legal 
systems, therefore, case law and teaching have, as would be expected, examined 
the concept of damage and the different types of damage, at least in outline. Es-
sentially, the premise is a concept developed by law and damage is understood as 
a detrimental, legally relevant change to protected interests, though above all a 
distinction is drawn between pecuniary and non-pecuniary harm344. Lastly, it is 
worth mentioning that PETL in art 2: 101 even give a comprehensive definition of 
damage as: &raquo; material or immaterial harm to a legally protected interest &laquo;. Art VI.&ndash;

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>2: 101 DCFR gives a description of &raquo; legally relevant damage &laquo;. In this respect it is 
noteworthy that when no express rule provides for it, pursuant to para 2, &raquo; loss or 
injury constitutes legally relevant damage only if it would be fair and reasonable 
for there to be a right to reparation or prevention &laquo;. Hence, the provision does not 
ask which damage is recoverable but stipulates that the result of the examination 
of all the prerequisites for imputation in respect of &raquo; loss or injury &laquo; is deemed to 
be the damage.
</p>
<p>According to  Green / Cardi,  the situation in the USA is not very different345: 
&raquo; Much of the general description of damage, recoverable damage, and pecuniary 
and non-pecuniary damage in Basic Questions comports with US law, although 
&rsaquo;harm&lsaquo; is often the term employed to describe these detriments. Tort law in the US 
also permits recovery only for legally cognizable harm. &laquo;
</p>
<p>In respect of English law, however, Oliphant346 highlights very significant dif-
ferences: &raquo; There is no general concept of &rsaquo;damage&lsaquo; in English tort law, and aca-
demic discussions of the topic have been few in number, but damage does play an 
important role in most torts recognised by English law. As there are, according to 
one estimate, some 70 or more torts recognised by the common law, it could be 
said that there are in fact 70 or more different conceptions of damage in English 
tort law347. That is to overstate the case somewhat, but it gives some indication 
of the difficulty facing an English lawyer in this area. It by no means follows that 
what is recognised as damage in Tort A is so recognised in Tort B. &laquo; This in turn is 
no doubt connected with the fact that torts actionable per se ( eg trespass ) do not 
require any damage but merely an interference and thus are not aimed at compen-
sating damage either; furthermore, injunctions, both preventive and reparative, 
are also covered by the law of torts although they do not require the occurrence of 
any damage and are not directed at compensating damage but at preventing or re-
moving some interference. Therefore, this lack of distinction between the legal in-
struments according to their tasks, prerequisites and legal consequences means 
damage cannot be recognised as a general prerequisite in the field of the law of 
torts and is an obstacle to the discussion of the types, differences and common 
features of any such prerequisite of damage.
</p>
<p>Once again it is apparent348 that the extended, diverse field of the law of torts 
under the common law can by no means be equated with the laws of damages 
in Continental Europe. Only that &ndash; admittedly major &ndash; part of the law of torts in 
which the occurrence of damage is required and compensation of such is stipu-

<p>lated as the legal consequence can be equated with the field of extra-contractual 
liability for damage. Only that area can thus ultimately be included in the elabora-
tion of common features and differences in this investigation. In respect of this 
part of the law of torts, which is directed at the compensation of harm caused, it 
must also be possible to draw a more general outline of damage for English law 
and elaborate the different types of damage.
</p>
<p>In some of the legal systems discussed here it is emphasised that recoverable 
pecuniary damage basically includes both actual loss ( damnum emergens ) and 
loss of profit ( lucrum cessans )349. Because of the principle of full compensation, 
however, this distinction often does not play any particular role except in connec-
tion with the question of whether pure economic loss is recoverable350. &raquo; Real dam-
age &laquo; is also mentioned occasionally351. It can be relevant particularly in connec-
tion with restitution-in-kind. By contrast, the distinction between pecuniary and 
non-pecuniary damage is familiar to all the legal systems; in this respect the spe-
cial nature of non-pecuniary damage is generally highlighted and it is indicated 
that courts are cautious about awarding compensation for it352; as such in France 
concerns about converting suffering into money also exist. In some legal systems 
it is argued that the remedy is not a simple compensation of damage but a differ-
ent type of indemnification353.
</p>
<p>B.  Conclusions
</p>
<p>It must be stressed yet again that only that part of the law of torts may be included 
in the investigation which has compensatory damages as the legal consequence 
and thus, as in the Continental European laws of damages, deals with the com-
pensation of damage caused.
</p>
<p>Insofar as the understanding of pecuniary damage is the subject of discussion, 
there do not really seem to be any unbridgeable gaps; only clearer elaboration 
could present difficulties. In the case of non-pecuniary damage, however, more fun-
damental questions arise.
</p>
<p>Firstly, even a clear delineation of what comes under the heading of non-pe-
cuniary damage meets with obstacles. Nonetheless, it seems necessary to distin-
guish between pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage since &ndash; as will be discussed

</p>
<p>in more detail directly below &ndash; a widespread reservation regarding the compen-
sation of non-pecuniary damage in comparison to damages for pecuniary dam-
age can be discerned. The boundary between the two types of damage and the 
elaboration of the grounds for the distinction are thus necessary given the differ-
ent legal consequences. Only when there is clarity about this will it be possible 
to halt fraudulent labelling, which is resorted to in order to try and close &ndash; sup-
posed or real &ndash; gaps in protection in the case of non-pecuniary damage, and to 
ensure results that conform to underlying value judgements. As can be seen espe-
cially in German law &ndash; but sometimes under other legal systems too &ndash; non-pecuni-
ary damage is not infrequently labelled as pecuniary damage in order to achieve 
the desired recoverability354. Simply re-labelling the damage cannot, however, be 
a convincing solution; rather it must be questioned whether there are sufficient 
grounds for awarding compensation for non-pecuniary damage in such cases, al-
though it would not be recoverable under the general laws. In this respect, it is of 
course right and proper to base this evaluation on the values which underlie the 
statutory or court-made rules. Thus, for example, if certain forms of non-pecuni-
ary damage can typically be assessed on the basis of objective criteria, this can jus-
tify an expansion of its recoverability355.
</p>
<p>A further issue is whether damages for non-pecuniary damage serve to com-
pensate such damage or have another function. Just as in former times German 
law emphasised the satisfaction function of damages for non-pecuniary dam-
age356, nowadays Hungarian law has also turned from talking simply of compensa-
tion to using the term indemnification357. It is certainly true that it is not exactly 
the same as compensation of pecuniary damage, since the latter can be measured 
in money and thus also directly compensated in money, whereas this is per defi-
nitionem not the case with non-pecuniary damage. In the case of non-pecuniary 
damage, therefore, a monetary payment can only provide a remedy by making 
funds available with which &ndash; roughly speaking &ndash; the victim is put into a position 
in which he can obtain non-pecuniary benefits as compensation for the non-pecu-
niary harm. Whether one then says that this no longer constitutes compensation 
per se but rather indemnification or calls both cases compensation but considers 
that there are some special features in the case of non-pecuniary damage is more 
or less a terminological issue and a question of how clearly the distinction is ex-
pressed. In fact there would seem to be no real conflict between the two viewpoints.

</p>
<p>Further, while it can be seen that all legal systems display a certain hesitance 
as regards the recoverability of non-pecuniary damage, the limitations are differ-
ent and sometimes uncertain. At the same time, it is clearly the underlying values 
that are at issue, regarding how weighty the grounds for this reluctance are con-
sidered to be on the one hand, and how worthy of protection the non-pecuniary 
interests are adjudged to be on the other. Rigid, clearly definable boundaries will 
be very difficult to find. From an international perspective, there is undoubtedly a 
general tendency to expand recoverability and, to date, no clear limits have been 
set. However, the voices warning against over-extending compensation should be 
given more attention, particulary since the burden of compensation payments al-
ready places a worrying burden on freedom of movement: Green / Cardi358 rightly 
point to the concern expressed by important voices to the effect that &raquo; giving legal 
recognition to emotional harm will increase the extent of it &laquo;. This corresponds to 
an argument that is also familiar in Austria359. The impossibility of establishing 
whether there is in fact non-pecuniary damage and the lack of objectivity in the 
assessment of such have already been mentioned360. Therefore, the Hungarian 
viewpoint, namely that non-pecuniary damage should only be compensated when 
there is interference with personality rights361, is definitely worthy of discussion 
though an extension in the case of intentional damage would also be worth con-
sidering. In any case, these questions concern fundamental value judgements, for 
which it should be possible to find a compromise in the case of harmonisation 
of laws.
</p>
<p>Finally, a fundamental problem arises with respect to coma patients; this is re-
solved in a fairly uniform manner in the legal systems discussed in this investiga-
tion, however: in France362 coma patients are awarded compensation on the basis 
of an objective assessment; in Hungary the claim for compensation of non-pecu-
niary damage is based on the unlawful impairment of a personality right363. In a 
similar fashion coma patients in the USA are also awarded compensation for &raquo; loss 
of enjoyment of life &laquo;364. This corresponds to the results of a broader comparative 
law study365 and can be justified by arguing that, in an objective fashion, only the 
impairment of the personality rights is assessed and the purely subjective feelings 
that cannot be measured are not taken as the basis.

<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>A similar problem arises in the case of legal entities, which of course are not 
capable of feeling emotions. This is why an increasing number of obstacles are 
appearing in England as regards compensation awards for legal entities when 
their personality rights are infringed366. By contrast, the trend is moving in the 
other direction in France: the tendency not to award legal entities damages for 
non-pecuniary damage is increasingly abandoned367, though there is still no de-
sire to acknowledge their personality rights. Mor&eacute;teau368 not only vehemently ar-
gues against granting legal entities personality rights, he also opposes awarding 
them compensation for non-pecuniary damage, invoking the argument that legal 
entities cannot have any feelings. In Hungary, on the other hand, legal entities are 
granted compensation when their personality rights are infringed369. In Poland370 
one school of thought argues that legal entities cannot feel any emotional pain 
and accordingly wishes to deny them compensation for non-pecuniary damage; 
the opposing school of thought, which is also followed by the Supreme Court, 
does believe in granting them compensation for the impairment of personality 
rights. The objective evaluation of personality right infringements in respect of 
legal entities too is thus likely to meet with a favourable response at present in 
the majority of the legal systems; however, this cannot be said with any certainty 
of France for instance. Perhaps consensus could be facilitated if, bearing in mind 
the difference between people and legal entities, great reticence was exercised 
when granting personality rights and accordingly legal entities were only granted 
personality rights insofar as such also lies in the interests of society &ndash; as the pro-
tection of human dignity cannot be at stake. This could lead for instance to the 
protection of their name, as the identification of entities is also important to the 
public, and freedom of expression since this is of great significance to society be-
cause the media are generally run by legal entities371. Insofar as personality rights 
are recognised, it seems necessary, however, to provide protection under the law 
of damages for subjective rights.
</p>
<p>Besides this, there is another problem, which involves not only non-pecuniary 
but also pecuniary damage, namely whether parents should be entitled to claim 
compensation in the case of the unwanted birth of a child ( wrongful conception 
and wrongful birth )372. In the above cases only compensation for the pecuniary

<p>and non-pecuniary damage as a result of pregnancy and birth as well as com-
pensation for the impairment of the right to self-determination in this respect is 
granted in England but the costs of child maintenance are not covered373. In Nor-
way, parents are not compensated for maintenance costs, nor do they receive any 
payment for the impairment of their right to self-determination374. In France375 it 
seems that there is no question of compensating the non-pecuniary damage sus-
tained due to the impairment of the right to self-determination and other dam-
age is only compensated by way of exception, for example in case of rape, incest, 
the birth of a child with a disability and perhaps in cases where the victim is in 
serious financial difficulties. The claims are somewhat more extensive in Polish 
law376: besides the damage that arises due to pregnancy and birth, the increased 
maintenance costs for a child with a disability but also the normal maintenance 
costs for a child without a disability can be compensated if the mother is not able 
to cover the needs of the child. Furthermore, the non-pecuniary damage arising 
as a result of frustration of family planning is recoverable. Hungary goes even 
further, since full cover for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage is awarded 
where a child with a disability is born377. This diversity of viewpoints also reflects 
an even broader comparative overview378. It is almost impossible to speculate on 
which compromise could be feasible here. As the national debates correspond 
to international discussion, sufficient openness to agreeing a solution should be 
available everywhere. In any case, the arguments relevant for a decision have been 
sufficiently prepared379.
</p>
<p>It has been noted that a mediatory solution was proposed for the German 
speaking legal systems380: the harm consisting in the generation of the child main-
tenance claim is not deemed to be recoverable, the argument being above all that 
the injuring party did not only cause the maintenance duties but also a compre-
hensive family relationship has arisen, which consists of pecuniary but also non-
pecuniary duties and rights. As the pecuniary and non-pecuniary components are 
inseparably interwoven, so the argument goes, the focus cannot be solely on one 
duty but must take account of the overall relationships, which, however, may not 
be seen in principle as harm; instead the premise ought to be that the pecuniary

<p>harm ( in particular due to maintenance duties ) is usually balanced by the non-pe-
cuniary advantages ( joy of having the child )381. This is, however, no longer the case 
when the parents&rsquo; maintenance duties impose an extraordinary burden on them; 
in such cases the costs exceeding the ordinary burden must be compensated. This 
would seem to be largely in line with the Polish standpoint.
</p>
<p>II.  Causation
</p>
<p>A.  Comparative review
</p>
<p>It is generally acknowledged that liability only comes into question when there is 
a link between the conduct that may trigger liability and the damage sustained382. 
This prerequisite is examined on the basis of the conditio sine qua non formula 
( or the but-for test )383. This is ultimately true, despite all the uncertainties, for 
France too384, as it is stressed that: &raquo; French courts will exclude liability every time 
it can be proved that without the alleged fact, the damage would nonetheless have 
occurred &laquo;.
</p>
<p>What still remains to be overcome is the insufficient terminological and also 
conceptual distinction between the criterion of causation and the restrictions on 
imputation. Causation only marks the extreme limits of imputability, whereas re-
strictions on imputation are based on value judgements, for example with the aid 
of the adequacy criterion or the protective purpose of the rule, which are often re-
ferred to under the heading &raquo; legal causation &laquo;385. At this point the discussion will 
</p>
<p>381 In sum this means non-pecuniary advantages are set off against pecuniary harm. The admis-
sibility of balancing advantages against disadvantages in this manner is controversial. It was, 
however, recently legitimised in an extensive, thorough and far-reaching investigation by: Erm, 
Vorteilsanrechnung beim Schmerzensgeld &ndash; ein Beitrag zur Fortentwicklung des Schadens ( er-
satz ) rechts ( 2013 ) 313 ff, in particular 385 ff. Some American courts support such a balancing of 
advantages against disadvantages, see Green / Cardi, USA no 6 / 81.

<p>concern only that causation which is also called &raquo; natural &laquo; or &raquo; factual &laquo; causation, 
although it also involves legal aspects386, which shows above all how omissions are 
qualified as causes387. While the distinction between natural and legal causation 
is discussed in France too388, with the &raquo; equivalency of conditions &laquo; ( &eacute;quivalence des 
conditions ) being based on the &raquo; proximity &laquo; ( proximit&eacute;  des  causes ) or on the &raquo; ad-
equacy &laquo; of causation ( causalit&eacute; adequate ), ultimately, however, no clear distinction 
is drawn. This is the case even with respect to causation in all possible forms, on 
the one hand, and fault and / or wrongfulness, on the other, meaning that the logi-
cal reasoning behind decisions remains largely obscured. Neither can this negative 
aspect be resolved by the &raquo; common law inspired pragmatic approach &laquo; so highly 
lauded in the French report389: a pragmatic approach can only be persuasive when 
the results are in line with certain principles of justice, above all of equal treat-
ment and &raquo; Sachgerechtigkeit &laquo; ( the need to have appropriate regard to all involved 
interests ). In order to establish whether these principles are really complied with, 
it would be necessary to understand the grounds for the decision and weigh up 
the interests of the parties involved. None of this is really possible, however, when 
a number of highly diverse criteria for imputation are mixed together with no dis-
tinction being made between them and no guidance as to how the factors weighed 
up were evaluated is provided. Thus, this kind of &ndash; unreflected dogmatic consid-
erations &ndash; approach ought not to be taken as a model for harmonisation of law.
</p>
<p>That joint and several liability and not partial liability applies when several 
persons independently of each other are responsible for a conditio sine qua non 
in respect of the same damage and, thus, the entire damage is imputable to each 
of them, is a widespread view in the legal systems390, although this solution is by 
no means to be taken for granted391: if debt owed can be divided, ie in particular 
when it is monetary debt, liability for specific shares in the damage would be an

<p>option &ndash; thus, eg, in general &sect; 889 of the Austrian Civil Code ( ABGB ). Nonetheless, 
if each injuring party is responsible for the entire damage, there is an argument 
in favour of joint and several liability as such liability cannot result in a dispropor-
tionate extra burden for any one of them but simply means that the tortfeasors do 
not enjoy the advantage of partial liability. This seems reasonable as, on the one 
hand, it is more appropriate that the risk of one injuring party being insolvent is 
borne by the other injuring parties rather than the innocent victim, and on the 
other hand, enforcing the claim in the case of partial liability presents the victim 
with considerable difficulties, also due to the usually unknown extent of the inter-
nal shares in the case of such liability.
</p>
<p>The real problems, and therefore disagreements, appear in all legal systems 
in the context of multiple perpetrators acting in concert as well as cumulative, al-
ternative and superseding causation392.
</p>
<p>When there are a number of perpetrators acting in concert393 the problem is of-
ten the near impossibility of proving the causation of each individual&rsquo;s contribu-
tion since it is often possible that the others would also have carried out the act 
without this individual. According to the general rule, joint and several liability 
can only apply if the &ndash; often purely psychological &ndash; causation of each individual 
perpetrator can be proven. For this reason, joint perpetrators are subject to only 
partial liability in French law394. In Hungarian law, however, joint and several li-
ability is assumed and even if one of the joint perpetrators denies that the oth-
ers would have carried out the act without his involvement, this is not taken into 
consideration395. German and Austrian law also proceed basically on the premise 
of joint and several liability, without requiring proof of causation by each indi-
vidual396. This is based on the notion that the joint nature of the actions allows 
the assumption that each of those involved &ndash; psychologically or otherwise &ndash; was 
causal; liability for merely potential causation is thus affirmed. Nonetheless &ndash; un-
like under Hungarian law &ndash; it is open to each individual involved to prove that his 
contribution was not a conditio sine qua non for the occurrence of the damage. 
In Polish law, this problematic issue has not given rise to any special rule so that, 
even in the case of joint actions, causation would have to be proven397; the report 
does not indicate whether this is how it really works in practice.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>Cumulative causation is when two real events take effect simultaneously and 
each of the events on their own would have been sufficient to bring about the 
damage398. Neither under the conditio sine qua non formula nor according to the 
but-for test does either event constitute a necessary condition as in each case the 
other event would have brought about the damage on its own anyway399. Despite 
the lack of natural causation, it is generally assumed that both perpetrators are li-
able, and usually this is assumed to mean joint and several liability400; according 
to English law, however, there is apparently partial liability401. Nonetheless, if one 
of the events is a chance event which thus falls within the victim&rsquo;s sphere of risk, 
the liability of the culpable perpetrator is entirely rejected in the USA402. This is 
hard to justify as even in the case of contributory fault of the victim, the generally 
accepted rule is that the damage be apportioned and that the perpetrator is not 
completely released from liability. It would seem appropriate to take this idea into 
consideration here too.
</p>
<p>In cases of superseding causation, the two events that may give rise to liabil-
ity come into effect one after the other403. Although it is possible to see this as 
stretched out chronologically cumulative causation, the solutions provided for are 
nonetheless very diverse: in Norway404 there is discussion of the hypothetical case 
where A fatally injures a horse in a traffic accident and before it dies B shoots it. 
In logical extension of the solution for cumulative causation, it is assumed that A 
and B are jointly and severally liable. However, if the horse was in fact already dead 
when B shot it, A alone would be liable. This may seem surprising in that here too 
A would not be the cause of the death of the horse since it would have been shot by 
B and in this respect the situation is the same as in case of cumulative causation. 
The difference, however, is that, after the horse had died, the shooting could no 
longer endanger its life and thus, there would be no wrongfulness in this respect, 
meaning that there could be no question of B being liable405. On the other hand, it 
seems worthy of note that in the first variation, while B shoots the dead horse and

erty damage. Thus, there is a default duty to act with reasonable care when one&rsquo;s conduct cre-
ates a risk to others. Duty would not, in this regime, be as narrowly circumscribed with regard 
to specific property. &laquo;

<p>thus certainly acts wrongfully, the horse only has a very low value due to its fatal 
injuries; this could be seen as an argument against joint and several liability and 
thus a reason to treat the perpetrators equally. In Poland406, unlike in Norway but 
in line with the prevailing view in Austria, it is assumed that the second event is to 
be disregarded and the first perpetrator should remain solely and entirely liable. 
Besides this, however, other diverging viewpoints are defended; in particular the 
Polish Supreme Court tends to take the second event into account407. According 
to Oliphant408, the liability of the first perpetrator is not affected in England either 
by the fact that a second perpetrator would have brought about the same damage; 
the second perpetrator will not be held liable. If the second event falls within the 
victim&rsquo;s sphere of risk, on the other hand &ndash; in a very remarkable contradiction of 
the value judgements underlying the solution in the case of two responsible per-
petrators &ndash; the first perpetrator is freed from liability so that the victim must bear 
the entire damage alone; this is in harmony with liability in the case of cumulative 
causation. This corresponds too with the solution in the USA409 but Green / Cardi 
express their understanding of why joint and several liability might be assumed410 
when there are two responsible perpetrators while nonetheless proposing the in-
teresting departure that the second perpetrator&rsquo;s liability only arises with regard 
to the victim if the first perpetrator is insolvent411.
</p>
<p>The most important category in practice is presented by the cases of alterna-
tive causation: the victim has suffered damage which has definitely been caused 
either by event 1, which was caused wrongfully and culpably, or by event 2, that in 
the first variation was also brought about wrongfully and culpably but in the sec-
ond variation is a result of chance; it is not possible, however, to determine which

bers of proceedings, as often the insolvency of the primary, definitely liable perpetrator only 
comes to light during the proceeding and then a second proceeding against the only contin-
gently liable party becomes necessary; in the case of joint and several liability, on the other 
hand, both perpetrators could be sued in one proceeding.

<p>of the two events was the cause412. According to English413 and Norwegian414 law &ndash; 
as in Switzerland415 &ndash; neither of the two potential perpetrators is liable. However &ndash; 
even in common law &ndash; diverging opinions are put forward; Askeland nevertheless 
considers that proportional liability is not reconcilable with the applicable Nor-
wegian law. In France416 it seems that joint and several liability will be applied if 
the perpetrators acted as a group. Poland417, Hungary418 and Japan419, on the other 
hand, go beyond this so that the joint and several liability of the potential perpetra-
tors is assumed; however, if one of the two events is a result of chance, the victim 
will have no entitlement to compensation. Partial liability is rejected in any case. 
In the USA, the liability of two alternative perpetrators seems to run into the diffi-
culty that no balance of probability can be determined and moreover the theory of 
&raquo; risk contribution &laquo; which points to partial liability is not overly popular420; partial 
liability would often seem to be achieved, however, via the loss of chance theory421. 
This theory is used regularly in its land of origin, France422, but not applied in 
England and Poland423; in Hungary it is applied in relation to doctors&rsquo; liability424.

</p>
<p>While the DCFR chose the more conservative solution of joint and several li-
ability of alternative perpetrators ( art VI.&ndash;4: 103 ), the EGTL proposes a more mod-
ern rule in art 3: 103 para 1 PETL: &raquo; In case of multiple activities, where each of them 
alone would have been sufficient to cause the damage, but it remains uncertain 
which one in fact caused it, each activity is regarded as a cause to the extent cor-
responding to the likelihood that it may have caused the victim&rsquo;s damage. &laquo; Fur-
ther, PETL proposes a rule for the even more difficult case that an event giving rise 
to liability and a chance event are the alternative causes. In logical extension of 
art 3: 103 para 1, it also provides for partial liability here so that the potential injur-
ing party must bear part of the damage.
</p>
<p>As far as market share liability is concerned, this would seem to be accepted 
in France425 but not in Poland or Hungary426. In the USA427, market share liability 
is limited to products with generic risks; therefore it was not applied analogously 
to asbestos products, for example, as the different products give rise to different 
risks.
</p>
<p>B.  Conclusions
</p>
<p>There is controversy above all in relation to the approaches taken in cases of un-
certain causation, in particular in the case of alternative causation with one pos-
sible cause being an event that would trigger liability and the other a chance event. 
The doctrine that relies on the loss of a chance is not, in my opinion, persuasive ei-
ther dogmatically or &ndash; as not all similar cases can be solved alike &ndash; from the point 
of view of the result428. It is understandable that there are serious concerns as re-
gards the approach based on potential causation which leads to partial liability for 
alternative perpetrators and to apportionment between the potential perpetrator 
and the victim when an event that would trigger liability competes with a chance 
event, as it departs from the prerequisite of proven causation. Moreover, it plays 
a role that in the common law it is the predominance of probabilities rather than 
the conviction of the judge or the high probability429 that is decisive with respect 
to the basis for liability430. It does not seem very satisfactory, however, to leave the 
victim alone with the entire burden of the risk when it is not possible to deter-
mine which of two parties who have acted wrongfully and culpably have caused 
the damage, or when the chance event which falls in the victim&rsquo;s sphere of the risk

</p>
<p>may have caused the damage with roughly equal probability as a wrongful, culpa-
ble action. On the one hand, this would produce rigid, all-or-nothing solutions 
and, on the other hand, it seems unreasonable that, in the case of roughly equal 
probability, the party who acted wrongfully and culpably and who brought about 
the lack of clarity as to causation is freed completely from liability while the inno-
cent victim must carry all of the risk431.
</p>
<p>On the basis of these considerations, partial liability would certainly be func-
tionally more desirable and could also be justified by theoretical arguments de-
spite the weighty counter-arguments as the solution by no means conflicts with 
existing principles and there are certainly theoretical starting points for the par-
tial solution: on the one hand, apportionment of damage is generally accepted 
when imputation criteria fall into both the injuring party&rsquo;s and the victim&rsquo;s sphere, 
namely the contributory responsibility of the victim. In terms of the underlying 
value judgements, the cases under discussion here are similar: the conduct that &ndash; 
apart from the proven causation &ndash; triggers liability of the potential injuring party 
is countered by an event that falls within the victim&rsquo;s sphere of risk. At least in the 
case of roughly equal probability, there is no justification for favouring the culpa-
ble perpetrator with complete freedom from liability.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that all legal systems depart 
from the conditio sine qua non formula and the but-for test when establishing li-
ability in cases of cumulative causation; in that case, merely potential causation is 
deemed to be sufficient. In cases of joint perpetrators too, there is a tendency to 
allow merely possible causation to be enough for liability to arise.
</p>
<p>Hence, it should be possible to develop the same ideas using the approach 
of partial liability in order to find consensus on a solution for cases of alternative 
causation432.
</p>
<p>431 See on this also Gilead / Green / Koch, General Report, in: Gilead / Green / Koch ( eds ), Proportional 
Liability 1 ff. They look for the solution on the basis of the aims of the law of damages and 
argue as follows ( 7 f ): &raquo; The major goal of tort law is to foster justice and fairness. Subject to 
considerations of justice and fairness in the allocation of risks and harms, the increase of the 
aggregate wellbeing in society ( efficiency ) is also a worthy secondary goal of tort law. This goal 
attempts to increase overall well-being by inducing potential actors to avoid harms that can 
be prevented at lower cost than the harm ( deterrence ) and by minimizing the costs of deter-
mining who should bear the cost of those accidents that do occur ( administrative efficiency ). 
Given that, the question is which rules best promote the goals of tort law. &laquo; With these very 
general and undefined statements of the aims of tort law, however, it will hardly be possible to 
arrive at concrete results.

<p> Part 6  The elements of liability
</p>
<p>I.  Preliminary remarks
</p>
<p>At first glance, there may be an impression that there is far-reaching consensus 
on the grounds for imputing damage caused:  fault has been recognised for cen-
turies as an element of liability; liability for the misconduct of auxiliaries is also 
to be found in all legal systems; and a strict liability independent of fault, in par-
ticular for especially dangerous things or activities, is on the advance &ndash; except in 
common law jurisdictions. When we look more closely, however, there are con-
siderable differences even in the understanding of fault, which also presented 
the European Group on Tort Law with significant difficulties433. Wrongfulness  is 
often recognised as a separate ground of fundamental importance for imputa-
tion and is seen as a prerequisite for fault, yet in some legal systems it is not even 
discussed; moreover, it turns out to be an extremely ambiguous term434. Liability 
for auxiliaries is very differently structured and the underlying principles are still 
controversial435. Liability for dangerousness is recognised in many jurisdictions 
as ranking equally with fault-based liability, in other legal systems it is practically 
unknown436. Further grounds for imputation lead a shadowy existence and ulti-
mately there is often no awareness even of the question of the interplay between 
different elements of liability, let alone comprehensive conclusions having been 
arrived at in the debate.

</p>
<p>II.  The misconduct
</p>
<p>A.  Comparative review
</p>
<p>1.  Wrongfulness and fault
</p>
<p>The Norwegian report  437 demonstrates very well that the difficulties highlighted 
in the German legal family ultimately also exist in other legal systems too: the uni-
form, unspecific term of wrongfulness obscures the fact that very different things 
are meant by this term and its relationship to fault is also blurred. The self-critical 
declaration by Askeland  438 to the effect that &raquo; A crude outline of the Norwegian per-
ception of wrongfulness may be that it mostly refers to conduct, but may also refer 
to the concept of damage. &laquo; is telling. This refers, however, merely to the very le-
gitimate distinction, also discussed in the German legal family, between wrongful-
ness of the result ( Erfolgsunrecht )  439 and wrongfulness of the conduct ( Verhaltens-
unrecht )  440, which also gives rise to difficulties in other legal systems441.
</p>
<p>Both concepts of wrongfulness are ultimately justified since they deal with 
different aspects: on the one hand, there is the determination at a high level of 
abstraction that there has been a disadvantageous change not desired by the legal 
system because of interference with protected interests442; this type of wrongful-
ness of the result touches on the concept of damage443 as it deals with the occur-
rence of legally relevant harm. This concept of wrongfulness, which in my opinion 
would be better described as fulfilment of the factual elements of the offence ( Tat-
bestandsm&auml;&szlig;igkeit ), is also important outside of the law of damages &ndash; for example, 
in respect of preventive and reparative injunctions444 as well as claims based on 
unjust enrichment 445, as it concerns the respective protection of interests and how

case law ( Menyh&aacute;rd, Hungary no 4 / 104 ).

<p>7 / 148 ff and 374 ff.
442 In Japan &ndash; like in Germany apparently &ndash; wrongfulness of the result is invoked above all when it 
</p>
<p>comes to absolutely protected rights of control ( &raquo; Herrschaftsrechten &laquo; ), while the duties to meet 
certain standards of behaviour are determined on the basis of a comprehensive weighing up 
of interests when it comes to the &raquo; correlative rights &laquo;; see Yamamoto, Japan no 7 / 379 ff.

the connection between damage and the duties of care as well as the extent of the liability.

</p>
<p>far this goes. The finding that a protected interest has been infringed does not in 
itself reveal anything about whether this occurred as a result of concrete, blame-
worthy misconduct, which can be the foundation of fault-based liability.
</p>
<p>This conclusion would require the determination that the conduct of the in-
juring party has infringed an objective standard of care446, ie that he acted negli-
gently, at least, and thus wrongfully insofar as his conduct is concerned447. In this 
sense, art VI.&ndash;3: 102 DCFR describes &raquo; negligence &laquo; as the neglect of the &raquo; standard 
of care &laquo;; art 4: 102 PETL refers to the &raquo; standard of conduct &laquo;.
</p>
<p>This objective infringement of a duty of care is distinguished in almost all 
legal systems from  fault448, which &ndash; though to extremely various degrees &ndash; is re-
lated to the subjective blameworthiness of the conduct, with the personal abili-
ties and knowledge of the injuring party being taken into account; this is shown 
at a minimum by consideration of age and mental illness449. However, in some 
legal systems this is obscured by the fact that there is talk of objective duties of 
care adapted to the age of children or to people with mental disabilities450; this is 
also the approach taken by art 4: 102 para 2 PETL and art VI.&ndash;3: 103 para 1 DCFR. In 
order to overcome reluctance to take account of subjective circumstances when 
determining fault, in particular due to the difficulties of proof, the Hungarian so-
lution451 &ndash; a reversal of the burden of proof &ndash; could provide some starting points.
</p>
<p>The threefold division into factual elements of the offence ( Tatbestandsm&auml;&szlig;ig-
keit ), breach of a duty of care and subjective blameworthiness reflects practical 
necessity and is ultimately significant in this respect even in legal systems that 
only base the decision on fault and do not openly recognise the notion of wrong-
fulness, for example French law452: naturally, it only makes sense to speak of fault 
</p>
<p>446 This is only relevant in the USA: Green / Cardi, USA no 6 / 114.
447 Cf Mor&eacute;teau, France no 1 / 167. It must be pointed out that in Japanese law ( see Yamamoto, Japan 
</p>
<p>no 7 / 147 ) there is emphasis of the gradability of wrongfulnesss. In Austria too there is support 
for the view that wrongfulness may be accorded different weight ( Koziol, Haftpflichtrecht I 3 
no 4 / 18 with additional references ).
</p>
<p>448 Very clear is the new Hungarian Code: Menyh&aacute;rd, Ungarn no 4 / 105; see also  Ludwichowska-

</p>
<p>as a ground for imputation when the conduct involved is not allowed under the 
legal system and is blameworthy453. Thus, wrongfulness is inevitably an inherent 
objective element within fault or a prerequisite for fault454. These two manners of 
speaking are not so very different in fact, but the latter variation is preferable as 
wrongfulness also frequently plays a role as an independent criterion for impu-
tation, which together with other criteria &ndash; for example the financial capacity to 
place the burden on children or mentally ill persons &ndash; can also provide a basis for 
liability even where there is no subjective blameworthiness455.
</p>
<p>This Babylonian tower of confusion, debate at cross purposes and numerous 
misunderstandings could all be avoided if these three levels of misconduct, which 
are material when fulfilling different aims, could be clearly distinguished and re-
ferred to using different terms, so that the debate could focus on the resolution of 
the real issues behind the terminology. It would no doubt be best to completely 
avoid the ambiguous expression of wrongfulness and talk of &ndash; result-based &ndash; fac-
tual elements of the offence ( impairment of a protected interest ) &ndash; behaviour re-
lated &ndash; negligence ( breach of an objective duty ) and fault ( subjective blamewor-
thiness )456.
</p>
<p>2.  De minimis rule
</p>
<p>The DCFR courageously sets out the de minimis rule in art VI.&ndash;6: 102: &raquo; Trivial dam-
age is to be disregarded &laquo;. At this level of generality, the rule certainly does not 
correspond to the existing laws in Europe. However, there are at least signs of 
recognition of the concept in EU countries457 due to the implementation of the 
Product Liability Directive, which stipulates a threshold of &euro; 500; the same applies 
for Norway458, but not for the USA459. In Norway460 the de minimis rule applies in 
respect of personal injury as well, in particular in the case of non-pecuniary dam-
age, but also in respect of the liability of parents for children461. In Hungary, on 
</p>
<p>453 See also in this sense Ludwichowska-Redo, Poland no 3 / 119. Accordingly the opposite viewpoint 
represented by Oliphant in respect of English law that fault is to be understood as an aspect of 
wrongfulness is surprising ( Oliphant, England and the Commonwealth no 5 / 118 ).

<p>the other hand, there are no further examples462. In Poland, neighbours on ad-
jacent pieces of land must tolerate average levels of impact on the enjoyment of 
their land without being entitled to compensation463; thus, it is clearly not wrong-
ful to cause such. In France too464, the usual impact on others is not deemed to be 
wrongful and the same applies to Japan465. In England and the USA &ndash; as a striking 
exception &ndash; a de minimis threshold was set in the asbestos cases in order to make 
sure the inadequate amounts of funding went to the victims with serious dam-
age466. The de minimis rule is either used to render minimal damage non-recover-
able467 or blocks compensation claims via preclusion of wrongfulness as regards 
the creation of merely minor risks468, though it is also necessary to distinguish 
whether the external elements of the offence or the breach of a duty of care have 
been negated. If the basis taken is the minor nature of the damage sustained, in 
that the external scope of protection for a legal good is generally limited to this ex-
tent, not only compensation claims but also preventive injunctions in this respect 
are precluded469; in other words certain infringements must be tolerated. On the 
other hand, if it is only the duties of care which are limited in this respect, only the 
duty to compensate for minor damage is precluded but the scope of protection is 
not otherwise limited and threatened damage can be averted by seeking injunc-
tive relief470.
</p>
<p>3.  The objective duties of care
</p>
<p>In some of the legal systems there is work on elaborating the factors that must be 
considered when establishing the objective duties of care: in Norway reference is 
made to the significance of the relationship between the injuring party and the 
victim471, further to the foreseeability of an injury472, how reasonable it would be to 
expect the injuring party to take a different course of action473 and also the interest 
in freedom of movement474. In Japanese law, regard is had in a very similar fashion 
</p>

<p>to the probability of damage, the weight of the injured interest and the weight of 
the interests of the acting party475. In the USA476, the list of relevant factors is very 
similar to PETL and the Austrian Draft of a new law of damages.
</p>
<p>4.  Omissions
</p>
<p>As regards omissions477, what is already known can be confirmed: duties to ac-
tively help others and safeguard such against damage are not recognised in Eng-
land and in the USA478. In England, however, exceptions are made when someone 
has created a source of danger or taken on responsibility for the welfare of another 
or due to his position carries such responsibility. In Norway too there is hardly any 
prospect of the courts affirming liability for failure to render assistance479; this is 
a point that stands out in surprising contrast to the otherwise generous treatment 
of the victim when granting compensation. In Hungary, by contrast, duties to ren-
der assistance are not rejected in principle480.
</p>
<p>5.  Pure economic loss
</p>
<p>In France481 and in Poland482 &ndash; like in Austria &ndash; economic interests are not denied 
protection in general but the compensation available is limited in various ways, in 
particular in that compensation is rendered only to the &raquo; direct victim &laquo; &ndash; a rather 
unclear term &ndash; and under especial consideration of the adequacy element; if there 
was intention on the part of the injuring party, more extensive claims are recog-
nised483, in particular when there is interference with third-party legal relations484. 
Beyond this, pure economic loss is fully recoverable in the case of culpa in con-
trahendo485; moreover, compensation is available to surviving dependants where 
the primary victim is killed486. In Hungary, there has apparently not been any de-
tailed discussion but it seems that the solution is worked towards from a causative

<p>approach; the latter is thus a prerequisite487. In England, there is great reticence 
towards the compensation of pure economic loss but some groups of cases have 
emerged in which compensation is granted488.
</p>
<p>6.  Objective and subjective assessment of fault
</p>
<p>The prevailing tendency nowadays is largely in favour of an objective assessment of 
fault489: thus, in France even the mentally ill are rendered liable without considera-
tion of their accountability for their actions on the basis of objective assessment 
of fault490. Beyond this, there is a presumption of fault when the wrongfulness of 
conduct has been proven491.
</p>
<p>In Poland492, the &raquo; normative &laquo; concept of fault includes a clear objectivisation 
that leads to difficulties distinguishing it from wrongfulness. The capacity for 
fault only begins when a child is 13 years old and only in case of soundness of 
mental health. Predominantly, however, individual aspects that are easy to iden-
tify or long-term will be taken into account, eg age, discernible physical or mental 
disabilities and illnesses493.
</p>
<p>In Hungary494 the objectivisation is likewise extensive; the knowledge, skills 
and abilities of the injuring party are not to be taken into account. Moreover, the 
standard for contractual breaches is considerably stricter than under the law of 
delict.
</p>
<p>Similarly, in England &raquo; negligence &laquo; and thus &raquo; fault &laquo; are objective standards; Oli-
phant quotes the classical description495: &raquo; Negligence is the omission to do some-
thing which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinar-
ily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a 
prudent and reasonable man would not do. &laquo; Skills, knowledge and abilities do 
not enter into the equation. Exceptions are made, however, for small children, as 
they do not yet have the capacity to act deliberately; in respect of older children, 
the question is whether they fulfil the standard that is to be required of a normally

<p>sensible child their age. In the case of children who engage in activities that are 
reserved for adults, however, the standard applicable to adults will be applied.
</p>
<p>In the USA496 too, an objective standard is used, with reference to the difficul-
ties involved in establishing subjective abilities and to the fact that it does not 
make any difference to the victim whether the injuring party has the necessary 
abilities or not. However, this is a very one-sided view; this would also mean any 
chance event could lead to compensation claims and any exceptions for children 
or mentally ill people would be inadmissible. However, in fact the objective duty 
of care is reduced for children and usually children under five or seven years old 
are freed from liability in any case; in the next age range &ndash; between seven and 14 
years of age &ndash; there is the rebuttable presumption that the child is not capable 
of being negligent and for those over 14 years of age the rule is a rebuttable pre-
sumption that they are capable of negligence497. Flexible rules also apply to physi-
cally disabled people in that the duties of care are adapted to their abilities. How-
ever, there is no consideration of cognitive disabilities498 and thus, those who have 
been equipped by nature with below average abilities but are not labelled &raquo; men-
tally disabled &laquo; are also burdened with the risk for behaviour they cannot avoid so 
that their daily lives are inescapably encumbered with duties to compensate. In 
stark contrast to this, above average abilities are taken into account and lead to a 
stricter standard for the duty of care499.
</p>
<p>Japanese law also applies an objective standard of fault and only takes account 
of the individual&rsquo;s subjective powers of discernment, which may influence his be-
haviour, in the case of children and mentally ill people500. Nonetheless, the objec-
tivisation is relativised by the fact that the yardstick for the injuring party is the av-
erage person in the group to which he belongs501. This group classification results 
in an interim position between objective and subjective fault.
</p>
<p>The diversity of rules on the liability of children for their own conduct is aston-
ishing: sometimes accountability is tied to specific age bands but sometimes it is 
not; insofar as age bands are stipulated, these have varying significance as they 
can either represent rigid boundaries or merely trigger rebuttable presumptions: 
usually children are liable alongside their parents but their liability can also be 
merely subsidiary; it can also be subject simply to the general rules or only appear 
as liability on grounds of equity, which will then depend above all on the financial 
circumstances of both injuring party and victim. Some legal systems provide for 
children to be liable subject to equity considerations but this is by no means true

</p>
<p>of most jurisdictions502. It is the case almost everywhere, nonetheless, that either 
the lack of or reduced powers of discernment are taken into account when assess-
ing fault or the objective duties of care are reduced accordingly.
</p>
<p>The situation in France503, on the other hand, is completely different as un-
like in other legal systems the liability of children is not less stringent but more 
stringent: after mentally ill persons were declared to be liable by law in 1968, the 
courts followed this example further in 1984 and decided that children would be 
fully liable regardless of their powers of discernment. The prerequisite for liabil-
ity is still, however, an objective breach of a duty of care, although it is possible to 
find formulations that even seek to depart from this and make liability strict. It 
is stressed that the liability of children is usually covered by their parents&rsquo; house-
hold insurance policies504.
</p>
<p>B.  Conclusions
</p>
<p>1.  Levels of misconduct
</p>
<p>The country reports once again clearly display the present-day terminological un-
certainty and the lack of clarity about the different functions of the categorisation 
into various levels of misconduct. The general passive resistance towards any clear 
elaboration of the different functions and the clear terminological classification 
of the different types of misconduct is astounding in face of the constant misun-
derstandings. In particular for the purposes of any international discussion, it is 
thus urgently necessary to achieve clarity in order to make effective communica-
tion possible. In fact, no real obstacles should present themselves since in truth 
different types of misconduct are known and needed in almost all legal systems. 
Therefore, a distinction should be drawn between very abstract interference with 
protected interests ( the factual elements of the offence ), the infringement of ob-
jective duties to behave in a certain way ( breach of a duty of care ) and the fault 
which &ndash; to a certain extent &ndash; must be assessed subjectively.
</p>

dren as Tortfeasors ( 2006 ) 425 ff, in respect of all of the above. In Japanese law there is no liabil-
ity on grounds of equity for children or mentally ill persons.

</p>
<p>2.  The subjective standard of fault
</p>
<p>As far as the return to subjectivisation of fault as a basically necessary element of 
imputation within the context of founding liability for misconduct is concerned, 
this must be strongly promoted on the basis of very fundamental considera-
tions505: in any case, insofar as human dignity requires society to enable such per-
sons to take part in general, social life, it would contravene human rights if any 
individual were ultimately held liable for being born with below average abilities. 
It does not make sense to recognise an individual as a member of society but at 
the same time to subject him to strict liability due to his mental or physical dif-
ficulties, so that he has no way to avoid this liability when taking part in everyday 
life and he is regularly subject to an especially heavy burden simply due to the way 
he is. It would not be in harmony with fundamental rights if people&rsquo;s inherent 
deficits were recognised as a ground for liability, ultimately forcing such people 
to choose between inescapable liability for participating in everyday life which is 
necessary to the dignity of human existence or to depart from life. It must also be 
noted that there can be no objective justification if most legal systems, while tak-
ing account of the individual traits of children and the mentally ill, nonetheless 
impose liability when it comes to somewhat less striking cognitive imperfection 
or physical frailty. Nor can this be convincingly countered by creating categories 
of people, eg blind people: apart from the fact that groups with different stand-
ards of care cannot be created for all types of cognitive or physical disabilities, this 
would also lead to objectivisation within the respective groups.
</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the limits to consideration of cognitive or physi-
cal disability must once again be highlighted: as far as the activities for which 
someone does not have the necessary abilities are avoidable, he must, as far as 
is reasonable, desist from such activities; if he does not do so, he is accountable 
for failing to comply with the objective duties of care. The arguments presented 
against taking subjective abilities into consideration, essentially that there would 
be serious difficulties in proving such, are not persuasive as these problems can 
be solved by the implementation of further rules on the burden of proof of fault: 
it seems logical that if someone has reached the relevant age for being capable 
of fault yet he is not so capable, he must prove that this is the case. In addition, 
he must show that due to his lack of the required abilities, he is not subjectively

<p>blameworthy; this kind of reversal of the burden of proof is familiar to many &ndash; 
above all central and eastern European &ndash; legal systems506. The consideration of 
subjective abilities can furthermore be qualified as in many legal systems in re-
spect of children: if the conduct was objectively in breach of duties of care, but the 
injuring party is subjectively not blameworthy due to lack of abilities, it is none-
theless possible to find full or partial liability in consideration in particular of ad-
vantages gained by the injuring party by the breach of duty of care as well as the 
financial circumstances of both parties. Moreover, social security largely covers 
damage in the area of bodily injuries.

<p>The return to subjectivisation of fault should also be facilitated having regard 
to the increasing prevalence of no-fault based, ie strict, liability, which appropri-
ately provides for compensation of damage independently of subjective elements.
</p>
<p>3.  The special problems concerning liability of children and persons 
not accountable for their actions
</p>
<p>A closer look at the liability of children for their damaging conduct will be taken 
here: the options range from complete lack of liability, subsidiary liability of par-
ents, personal liability for proven fault without considering the liability of the par-
ents, liability on grounds of equity ( even absent subjective fault but in the light 
of the financial circumstances of both the child and the victim ) and rather strict 
liability despite lack of powers of discernment. When looking at the national solu-
tions in a comparative law study, it must be borne in mind that the legal context 
must always be considered at the same time507.
</p>
<p>Let us begin with the extreme French approach: the concerns about the strict 
liability of children might be assuaged by the information that this has little prac-
tical significance as parents&rsquo; liability is even stricter ( on this below no 8 / 260 ff ) 
and victims thus tend only to resort to this; this is also encouraged by the fact that 
parents usually have relevant insurance cover and in addition they are more likely 
to be financially able to meet compensation claims. However, it should not be for-
gotten that in those &ndash; admittedly seldom &ndash; cases in which there is no insurance 
cover for all or part of the damage and the parents are not in a position to pay com-
pensation either, the strict liability for children can certainly become applicable; 
this is frequent especially in the case of very severe damage, which can lead to an 
especially onerous burden for children. Apart from this, the basic concerns that

<p>792 Helmut&emsp;Koziol&emsp; &emsp; Comparative conclusions
</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>children, like mentally ill people, are exposed to particularly strict liability rules 
despite their special worthiness of protection remain unanswered.
</p>
<p> Nonetheless, the basis for this rule becomes understandable when one firstly 
calls to mind the French tendency to generate as much compensation as possible 
for the victim for the damage he has suffered, and secondly one bears in mind the 
fact that children represent a special source of danger. However, as the general 
public has an eminent interest in them, it would not be objectively reasonable for 
the individual victim alone to have to bear the damage which was inflicted upon 
him by a source of danger in which the general public has a strong interest. Fur-
ther, it must also be taken into account that children&rsquo;s extensive liability risk is 
usually covered by liability insurance.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it does not seem appropriate at all that children bear the full 
burden of liability when there is no liability insurance or when the insurance does 
not cover all of the damage, as can happen above all when the sums involved are 
very high. A tenable solution could be found if all damage, even very severe dam-
age, that is caused by objective misconduct on the part of children is shifted to 
the general public for social reasons and thus covered by comprehensive &raquo; social 
liability  insurance &laquo;, with the premium structure not dependent on the extent of 
the insured risk but borne by all members of society, like social security contribu-
tions, in accordance with their income. This would be in harmony with the idea 
that damage caused by the misconduct of children, whose existence is in the pub-
lic interest, is also borne by the public and not by individual victims or by parents.
</p>
<p>As long as this approach of shifting the damage caused by children to society 
in general is not taken, in principle a solution requiring fault should certainly be 
preferred in the field of the law of damages. As to the more exact structure of this, 
while the concept of legal certainty can be used to argue for rigid age limits, the 
counter-arguments would seem to outweigh this concern: this concerns subjec-
tive imputation and as the personal development of children varies quite consid-
erably and in diverse situations very different powers of discernment are required, 
rigid age limits thus lead to results which in individual cases cannot be objec-
tively justified. The uncertainties are in any case no greater than when it comes to 
assessing the accountability of people with cognitive disabilities. Legal certainty 
and justice in the individual case can, moreover, be achieved optimally by a me-
dian solution, namely by introducing rebuttable presumptions which are linked 
to age limits appropriate to the typical development of children.
</p>
<p>As regards the decision on whether to allow children&rsquo;s liability &ndash; alongside 
that of their parents &ndash; to apply or only subsidiary in cases where the victim can-
not get any compensation from the parents, a case can be made for both sides: on 
the one hand, it would seem pragmatic for reasons of deterrence to adhere to the 
general liability rule and always make children liable when they have acted culpa-
bly; this aspect would be neglected if liability was only subsidiary as the parents

</p>
<p>who paid compensation would not be able to take recourse against the children 
either508. On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that victims will usually 
sue the parents as they are far more likely to be financially able to compensate 
the damage and also usually have to discharge their children&rsquo;s compensation du-
ties anyway. Beyond this, it must be considered that when parents are liable, they 
have neglected their duties toward the child &ndash; including those to protect the child 
against duties to compensate, and thus it seems reasonable that only the parents 
are liable. This also creates an incentive for parents to fulfil their duties of child-
rearing and supervision better than before. Both solutions, therefore, have a case 
to be made for them.
</p>
<p>Similar fundamental questions also arise in respect of persons who are not ac-
countable for their actions. Once again, the extreme French approach with strict li-
ability of mentally ill persons highlights a basic problem, which requires closer 
consideration. Those from legal systems &ndash; numerically in the majority &ndash; in which 
the special vulnerability of mentally ill persons is emphasised and their liability 
accordingly negated, will have a hard time understanding that precisely this in-
creased vulnerability leads to harsher liability rules. Nonetheless, as in the case of 
children, here too there are substantial arguments that can be presented in favour 
of the French approach. While certainly there is no particular interest on the part 
of society in having people be mentally ill &ndash; quite the contrary &ndash; it must neverthe-
less be borne in mind that society must consider general human rights and allow 
the mentally ill &ndash; albeit definitely within certain limits &ndash; to participate in social 
life. This will, however, give rise to unavoidable risks and it would again be unrea-
sonable to allow the individual victim to bear the effects of this risk alone when 
it ultimately exists in the interest of society, which has to ensure such persons 
live in a manner that is consistent with human rights. A solution that, on the one 
hand, considers the special need to protect mentally ill people against compen-
sation duties, but on the other hand also protects the victim from having to bear 
the negative effects of a risk that exists in society&rsquo;s general interest alone and thus 
makes compensation of damage in the case of objective misconduct by the non-
accountable person appear necessary, can once again only be arrived at by having 
society as a whole bear the risk. The idea here too would be to conceive &raquo; social li-
ability insurance &laquo;, to be financed by the general public.

<p>4.  The de minimis rule
</p>
<p>As regards any de minimis rule, it appears to me509 that in the field of pecuniary 
damage in any case there should be no threshold as this would be too rigid a limi-
tation, meaning it would not be possible to take account of the individual circum-
stances of the victim. However, it is certainly possible to draw on the approach 
widespread in the law of neighbours to say that each member of society will have 
to tolerate minor impairments that are hard to avoid in everyday co-existence510; 
so that to this extent the protection of legal goods is generally limited. Any special 
rule is, however, of little practical importance as the efforts and costs of asserting 
claims for minimal damage will make such more or less prohibitive anyway.
</p>
<p>In the case of  non-pecuniary  damage,  however, there should be an explicit 
limit: insofar as the sum involved is minor, for example, damages for pain and suf-
fering in respect of having someone step on one&rsquo;s toes in the throng at a station, 
once again this will in practice hardly be pursued, but there should be a further 
limit, as is already the case anyway in most legal systems. It seems fair to limit 
compensation to substantial non-pecuniary damage. Applying such a threshold 
is reasonable here because the compensation payment does not compensate any 
pecuniary loss which might influence the victim&rsquo;s living circumstances; non-pecu-
niary harm, which cannot be measured in money, is at issue. This limitation does, 
however, cause concern in that the non-pecuniary goods, in particular personal-
ity rights, are actually ranked above pecuniary goods and thus ought to be ac-
corded greater protection. However, it must be considered that the compensation 
of non-pecuniary damage is very difficult as this is hard to determine objectively 
and measuring the compensation amount is also very difficult. Furthermore, it 
must be considered that as part of co-existing in a society, certain non-pecuniary 
nuisances must also be tolerated as otherwise this co-existence would be over-bur-
dened with compensation duties. Moreover, there would be a risk that compen-
sation payments for emotional damage would actually increase sensitivity in this 
respect and thus actually worsen the non-pecuniary harm sustained rather than 
assuaging it, thus contravening the notion of compensation of damage. At least 
in the case of minor non-pecuniary damage, it is worth considering &ndash; drawing 
inspiration from the French approach &ndash; a simple court declaration of fact of the 
wrongful interference, without imposing any duty to compensate511. The de mini-
mis threshold must necessarily be very elastic, in particular in that it must have 
regard to the rank of the infringed interest, the objective determinability of the 
impairment and whether there are objective indications for the extent of the harm.

</p>
<p>III.  Liability for other defects in one&rsquo;s own sphere
</p>
<p>A.  Misconduct of auxiliaries
</p>
<p>1.  Comparative review
</p>
<p>There is great reticence regarding the regulation of liability for auxiliaries in the 
extra-contractual context in German law: the principal can free himself from li-
ability for the misconduct of auxiliaries when he proves that he exercised the nec-
essary care when selecting and instructing them. Still, this clearly acknowledges that 
the principal has such selection and supervision duties &ndash; a type of Verkehrspfli-
chten ( safety duties ). Polish and Hungarian law512 take the following approach: 
the principal is liable for fault in selection or supervision and there is a presump-
tion that such fault exists513. In Austrian law514, the principal is liable beyond this 
when &ndash; even if free of fault &ndash; he has used an unsuitable auxiliary; this is strict li-
ability based on the creation of a special source of danger.
</p>
<p>The other legal systems go further than this by refraining from taking a princi-
pal&rsquo;s misconduct as a prerequisite: pursuant to art 1384 Code civil in France, there 
is liability for the objective misconduct of those persons for whom one is responsible515. 
In Norway516 the principal is &raquo; liable whenever his employee causes damage in a 
culpable way within the scope of employment. The strict liability rule for the prin-
cipal is justified by the fact that the employer and the employee have a close and 
lasting relationship with the purpose of supporting the interests of the principal. &laquo; 
&raquo; Very short, unpaid services, for instance a neighbour buying bread &laquo; do not lead 
to this strict principal&rsquo;s liability. In Japan, regard is had to the fault of the princi-
pal but this is presumed and there is such a high standard for proving lack of fault 
that ultimately there is liability independent of fault517.
</p>
<p>Principals&rsquo; liability in England is strict518.  Oliphant  explains the reasons be-
hind this: &raquo; The justifications for this liability are much debated, but it is generally 
accepted that they rest on a combination of different considerations, including

513 There is no substance to the concerns that this cannot be fault in the real sense as the selection 
</p>
<p>cannot be wrongful: there is indeed &ndash; as mentioned in the text on the German law &ndash; a &raquo; Verkehrs-
sicherungspflicht &laquo; ( duty to protect others against risks that have been established by one&rsquo;s activ-
ity or property ) to select auxiliaries so that no danger to third parties emanates from them.

<p>efficient loss distribution, providing a just and practical remedy to prevent the in-
jured person going uncompensated and, insofar as the employer chooses whom 
to employ and has control over what is done, deterring future harm. &laquo; Likewise, 
the USA519 follows the principle of &raquo; respondeat superior &laquo;: &raquo; Employers are vicari-
ously liable for harm tortiously caused by an employee within the scope of em-
ployment. The liability of the employer is, thus, strict, but liability requires fault 
on the part of the employee. &laquo; The fundamental principle is seen in the &ndash; abstract &ndash; 
possibility of control. There is also reference to the notion of deterrence: the prin-
cipal is called upon to be particularly thorough and careful when selecting and su-
pervising; he is given an incentive to discipline auxiliaries following misconduct 
and beyond this, he is encouraged to replace auxiliaries with machines.
</p>
<p>These arguments cannot be considered very convincing: the first goal could 
also be achieved by fault-based liability &ndash; in particular linked with a reversal of the 
burden of proof; the second goal is merely a variation of the first. The third goal, to 
encourage principals via the strict rules on liability to make employees redundant 
and replace them with machines, is not in line with the general aims of our society, 
especially in times of high unemployment.
</p>
<p>Despite the lack of adequate justification, PETL ( art 6: 102 ) and the DCFR 
( art VI.&ndash;3: 201 ) also follow the international trend and provide for comprehensive 
liability in the case of misconduct by Besorgunsgehifen ( vicarious agents ).
</p>
<p>In the French report520 reference is made to a rule in the draft Catala ( art 1360 ) 
and thus to a practically speaking very significant but rarely ever discussed prob-
lem, namely the liability of parent companies for their subsidiaries; the issue must 
be the same when instead of a parent company we have an individual. Although 
the subsidiary is legally an independent legal subject, there is a lot to be said for 
seeing it differently in the light of rules on auxiliaries&rsquo; liability, specifically not as 
an independent company, if it is largely under the influence of the parent com-
pany. It must also be considered that any other solution would mean that the lim-
ited liability of corporate entities could be exploited in order to outsource activi-
ties likely to cause damage and thus essentially to shift the risk away from parent 
companies.
</p>
<p>2.  Conclusions
</p>
<p>The approaches taken by the legal systems when imputing misconduct of auxil-
iaries varies greatly. As it is generally recognised that one is not as a rule account-
able for third-party actions &ndash; explicitly, for example in &sect; 1313 of the Austrian Civil 
Code, the ABGB &ndash; departing from this so radically in the case of auxiliaries will

</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>require weighty arguments: liability for third-party actions can only be justified 
within a consistent overall system when there are correspondingly grave grounds 
for imputation, like the grounds that are stipulated for liability in the case of one&rsquo;s 
own culpable behaviour or in the case of liability for dangerous things521. The en-
tire framework of grounds for imputation must be considered and the liability 
for other persons must not be based on weaker grounds overall than for all other 
types of liability. To argue that someone deployed another person in their own in-
terest cannot provide a sufficient basis to make the principal accountable for all 
the damage caused in the course of carrying out the task assigned. Certainly it is 
right to point out that in any case it is generally recognised as a prerequisite that 
the auxiliary be guilty of misconduct and when there is a serious defect within 
the sphere of a person, this may justify imputing damage to that person where 
it is caused by such defect. However, the decisive question is when someone can 
be considered as belonging to the sphere of another person, thus making it seem 
right that this second person be liable for the misconduct of the former. It must be 
remembered that each person, ie also an auxiliary, is in principle responsible for 
his own conduct and that liability for another person cannot be imposed without 
further ado upon anyone else.
</p>
<p>The international debate in this respect obviously must still go into a lot more 
detail and differentiation522. Nonetheless, progress has already been made in some 
legal systems where very short, unpaid services do not suffice for imputation of 
the auxiliaries&rsquo; fault. But should it be sufficient to impose liability on a person 
who pays a messenger a fee to take medicine to a sick friend ? Can the completely 
altruistic interest in helping the friend justify imposing the burden of liability on 
the auxiliary ? Should it not also depend on the intensity of how the auxiliary is 
integrated into the sphere of the principal523, in particular the possibility for the 
principal to influence the behaviour of the auxiliary on the road, for example ? Is 
the power to influence sufficient when someone, for lack of his own abilities, en-
gages an expert entrepreneur, whom he obviously is not in a position to instruct 
on how to do things524 ? Ought it not also to be taken into account that by engaging 
an expert he has actually reduced the risk that third parties be injured525 ?
</p>
<p>Therefore, I have not yet seen any arguments to convince me that there should 
be a general strict liability for principals in the extra-contractual field ( see Basic 
Questions I, no 6 / 96 ); to my mind the better arguments speak in general for nar-

<p>rower liability for presumed fault in selecting or supervising auxiliaries. A conces-
sion could be made towards the broad counter-position, however, insofar as &ndash; like 
in Austrian law &ndash; strict, no-fault based liability is recognised if the auxiliaries are 
incompetent and thus a  source of particular danger has been created. Further, it 
could be objectively argued that more extensive liability for auxiliaries should be 
recognised in respect of entrepreneurs. After all, the same arguments as in favour 
of stricter enterprise liability could be brought, for instance, in connection with 
the serious defect within the sphere of the entrepreneur, namely the misconduct 
of the auxiliary within the context of his activity for the enterprise. Furthermore, it 
would seem proper to consider whether the principal ought, in terms of aims and 
purposes of tort law, to carry the ultimate responsibility for the carrying out of the 
duties for which he has engaged the auxiliaries526. Accordingly, when duties in the 
interim area between contract and delict are breached, for example duties to pro-
tect others against risks one has established by one&rsquo;s activity or property ( Verkehrs-
sicherungspflichten ), a more extensive imputation of the auxiliaries&rsquo; conduct seems 
justified. It seems completely unreasonable to me in any case that there be a gen-
eral strict liability for Besorgungsgehilfen ( vicarious agents ) in the private field.

<p>B.  Misconduct of children
</p>
<p>1.  Comparative review
</p>
<p>Most legal systems make parents liable for &ndash; objectively negligent527 &ndash; infliction of 
damage by their children only if the parents can be held accountable for miscon-
duct themselves, above all for a breach of their supervision or at least child-rearing 
duties, though there are variations in that the majority of legal systems make the 
liability rules stricter by reversing the burden of proof528. Both PETL ( art 6: 101 ) 
and the DCFR ( art VI.&ndash;3: 104 ) have chosen the option with the reversal of the bur-
den of proof. Spain and the Netherlands also have similar liability rules, beyond 
this however also a strict liability of parents: in Spain for the specific case that the 
child commits a criminal act529; in the Netherlands for the broad area of liability 
</p>
<p>526 See Ondreasova, Gehilfenhaftung 119 ff.

</p>
<p>for children under 14 years of age530. These two legal systems represent the mid-
dle ground leading up to Norwegian531 and French law532. In Norway, the parents 
have liability independent of fault for misconduct by their children. French law 
even goes one step further: according to present-day interpretation, art 1384 para 
4 Code civil sets out not only a strict liability of parents for damage inflicted by 
their children so that such can only free themselves from the duty to compensate 
by proving force majeure, but notably courts apply this liability for each and every 
injury inflicted by children, ie even when the child&rsquo;s behaviour was not objectively 
negligent and thus an adult would not be held liable for the same conduct.
</p>
<p>2.  Conclusions533
</p>
<p>The mostly fault-based liability of parents means that family law supervision duties 
are extended outward as it were and endowed with a third-party protective char-
acter534. This can be justified by the notion behind duties to protect others against 
risks one has established by one&rsquo;s activity or property ( Verkehrssicherungspfli-
chten )535: children generate special risks because they are not yet able to recognise 
dangers and behave appropriately. Those in whose sphere of responsibility the 
source of increased danger lies and who can thus take measures to avert or reduce 
the risk to others, have the duty to avoid damage occurring as far as is possible, 
including an obligation to take action within the limits of what is reasonable536.
</p>
<p>However, what justification can be found for how French law imposes a strict, 
no-fault based liability upon parents ( art 1384 para 4 Code civil ) and only frees them 
from liability in case of force majeure ? G. Wagner537 rightly emphasises that chil-
dren are obviously by no means comparable with sources of extraordinary danger 
such as motor vehicles and nuclear power plants and that, therefore, any strict

<p>800 Helmut&emsp;Koziol&emsp; &emsp; Comparative conclusions
</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>liability of parents is basically wrong. This objection is valid in respect of other 
legal systems but problematic as regards French law: art 1384 para 1 Code civil is 
currently interpreted as meaning that the keeper of a thing is strictly liable for the 
damage caused by this thing, regardless of whether the thing is faulty or danger-
ous538. The strict liability of parents for their children thus fits without conflict 
into the other French rules on liability. In principle the question, however, is how 
such strict liability of parents can be objectively justified, whereby it must be con-
sidered that, besides especial dangerousness, there can be other reasons for liabil-
ity independent of fault, one example being product liability539. Thus, it is neces-
sary to look more closely at the reasons given for French strict liability of parents. 
Firstly, this corresponds to the general basic tendency to focus primarily on the 
compensation of the victim and thus be very generous in this sense as regards the 
prerequisites for liability540. Further, the risk of damage that emanates from chil-
dren is used as an argument541. Above all, however, it is emphasised that almost all 
families have insurance policies that cover the liability of parents and children; as 
taking out such policies is not obligatory but after all intensively promoted and 
thus almost all the population has such cover, the premiums are very inexpensive.
</p>
<p>G. Wagner542 highlights the full compensation of the victim, the extensive dis-
tribution of risk and the low processing costs as the advantages of the French ap-
proach. He sees the disadvantages in: the low incentive to be careful when it comes 
to supervising and child-rearing as a result of the extensive insurance coverage, 
whereby the amount of the premium is not dependent on the risk543; the burden 
borne by families in the &ndash; albeit very low &ndash; costs of insurance for this far-reach-
ing liability; and the preference of the victim of damage caused by children over 
victims of damage caused by adults in that parents are accountable for damage 
caused by their children in cases where adults &ndash; for lack of wrongfulness &ndash; would 
not be liable for the same actions. Wagner, therefore, does not endorse the French 
approach. I would agree with him, in particular when one considers that the ar-
gument that stricter liability is balanced by inexpensive liability insurance by no 
means always applies, since such insurance is not compulsory and not every sin-
gle household has such insurance and, on the other hand, insurance companies 
no doubt limit coverage to a certain maximum sum. In any case, where there is no

<p>insurance coverage, the parents will be subject to the full harsh burden of the very 
strict, excessive liability.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the French approach could offer inspiration for a new type of so-
lution: by promoting the conclusion of policies that cover the liability of parents, 
the damage caused by children should largely be shifted to society as a whole. 
This is not fully the case today as insurance is not obligatory and, moreover, the 
costs for family insurance are borne by families and not the general public. How-
ever, one idea would be to logically follow through on the notion that society as a 
whole has an interest in people bearing children and, therefore, that the general 
public should also bear the costs of liability for damage caused by children. This 
could be realised, for example, in the form of unlimited social liability insurance 
for damage caused by children, with such being financed by the general public. 
Just like all the already existing social security insurances, the costs would not 
only be borne by those potentially liable later but by all those who have to pay so-
cial security contributions, without regard as to how likely the insured party is to 
constitute a risk. However, if the risk is thus shifted to society as a whole, there 
will no longer be any liability law incentive for parents to be diligent in child-rear-
ing and supervision.
</p>
<p>C.  Defective things
</p>
<p>Defective things within the sphere of the defendant play a considerable role in 
the German legal family, for instance in the cases of buildings, paths and motor 
vehicles. The defectiveness of things can lead to stricter liability due to a reversal 
of the burden of proof as regards fault because of the concrete danger associated 
with the things in question or the waiving of subjective fault as a prerequisite for 
liability; the defects may also lead to stricter rules on liability for dangerousness. 
Polish and Norwegian law also provide for stricter rules on liability due to the de-
fectiveness of things544; in Japanese law there are stricter liability rules in respect 
of damage as a result of defective constructions545. France goes furthest546, making 
the keeper of any defective thing liable independent of fault on the basis of the 
wide-ranging interpretation of art 1384 Code civil. As shown by Mor&eacute;teau, this view 
is also based to a certain extent on a weak version of the notion of wrongfulness, 
namely that the keeper has not maintained the thing duly and properly. In Hungary,

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>England and the USA, on the other hand, this aspect in respect of stricter liability 
rules is unknown547.
</p>
<p>Conclusions: in all those legal systems in which the dangerousness of the situ-
ation plays a role in establishing the duties of care, it could or indeed should play 
a role when defective things are at issue, as the dangerousness of things is usually 
increased by the defect and this would support increasing the duties of care.
</p>
<p>IV.  Dangerousness
</p>
<p>A.  Comparative review
</p>
<p>In the German speaking countries548, special dangerousness is recognised besides 
fault as an important element establishing liability and, hence, there is even talk of 
a two-lane liability system; the legislator has not, however, been bold enough yet 
to take the step to introduce a blanket clause. The diversity of European legal sys-
tems was already mentioned in Basic Questions I and is detailed, of course, in the 
country reports: in France, art 1384 Code civil is interpreted as meaning that the 
&raquo; gardien &laquo; is liable independently of fault, yet this liability does not depend on the 
liability element of special dangerousness but is at most sometimes part of the 
consideration of dangerousness increased by some defect549. The situation in Po-
land, on the other hand, corresponds to that in the German speaking countries550; 
the same applies to Japan551, whereas the Hungarian legislator has provided a gen-
eral rule for liability based on dangerousness552. In Norway, the courts have devel-
oped a general liability based on dangerousness553. In the USA, liability for &raquo; abnor-
mally dangerous activity &laquo; is recognised554; in England there is great reticence even 
in relation thereto555.
</p>
<p>The European Group on Tort Law merely managed a general rule for &raquo; abnor-
mally dangerous activities &laquo; ( art 5: 101 PETL ), which in any case should not apply 
when &raquo; common usage &laquo; is concerned; driving motor vehicles, for instance, is ac-
cordingly not covered. The DCFR &ndash; following the example of some national legal

</p>
<p>systems &ndash; has not set up any general rule but merely lists some individual sources 
of danger ( art VI.&ndash;3 : 201 ff ).
</p>
<p>B.  Conclusions
</p>
<p>The basic principles of liability based on dangerousness can be described as fol-
lows556: firstly, that damage is better imputed to the party whose interest the spe-
cial but admissible source of danger served; secondly, it makes more sense to im-
pose liability on the party who can influence the source of danger ( control of the 
risk ). If it is recognised that the special danger is generally a factor that can justify 
liability independent of fault, it is in line with the principle of equal treatment 
that this be regulated in a general rule; the special rules for individual sources 
of danger lead in any case to a contradiction within the overall legal system. The 
substantial difference in viewpoints as regards the scope seem more or less insur-
mountable so far, as strict liability in the common law is only recognised for ex-
traordinarily dangerous activities but not, for instance, for the ordinary dangers 
of road traffic. As regards this issue, there were also irreconcilable differences of 
opinion in the European Group on Tort Law. Comprehensive debate is thus still 
essential in order to at least find some kind of minimal consensus.
</p>
<p>However, it is possible that the difference lies only in respect of the explicit 
label and systematic classification of the liability. For there is reason to believe 
that even where no strict liability is foreseen, in fact liability will be recognised 
independently of fault since, possibly due to the very dangerousness of motorised 
road traffic, the duties of care are stretched to the extent   557 that a normal participant 
in road traffic cannot comply with them and thus, in fact strict liability based on 
dangerousness is applied, albeit not in name558. It was apparently in this manner 
that liability based on dangerousness developed in Norway559. Only an exact analy-
sis of English decisions would make it possible to determine if this is really the 
case in England; however, this would not only require a lot of work but also be very 
difficult as the descriptions of the facts in the decisions do not make it easy to tell 
what the relevant circumstances were, in fact sometimes it is impossible. If there 
is such a covert liability based on dangerousness, given the extensive overlap in

</p>
<p>practical terms, it would primarily only be the open recognition of such that is at 
issue, something which would not only be desirable for systematic reasons, but 
also in order to straighten out distortions within fault-based liability.
</p>
<p>V.  Economic capacity to bear the burden
</p>
<p>Polish law accords relatively weighty significance to the notion of economic capac-
ity to bear the burden560, namely in the case of liability for personal injury that is 
sustained by lawful exercise of state power, the liability of children and persons 
with cognitive disabilities and of people who keep animals; furthermore, the re-
duction clause refers, inter alia, to this criterion. In Hungary561, the notion of ca-
pacity to bear the economic burden plays a role in the application of a principal&rsquo;s 
liability for his auxiliaries; furthermore, this criterion is invoked, among others, 
when the reduction clause is applied.
</p>
<p>In England562 and the USA, on the other hand, this criterion is almost un-
known as an element influencing liability563. Given the explanations in the US re-
port, it must be pointed out, however, that this factor does not depend simply 
on the wealth of the tortfeasor, but a weighing up of the capacity to bear the eco-
nomic burden on both sides and, moreover, prevailing opinion is that this con-
cerns not merely wealth but generally how capable each party is of bearing the 
burden, something which may also be influenced by whatever insurance policy 
they have.
</p>
<p>Conclusions: in Continental Europe, the criterion of capacity to bear the eco-
nomic burden is certainly recognised as a factor that may tip the scales in border-
line cases. Whether it is possible to find consensus in the common law for this 
&raquo; supporting function &laquo; seems dubious. Once again, if an investigation of case law 
came to the conclusion that this criterion was in fact being used nowadays by the 
courts in a covert manner, this would have persuasive power.

</p>
<p>VI.  Realisation of profit
</p>
<p>The Polish report stresses that realisation of profit constitutes a material argu-
ment for recognising risk-based liability, ie liability based on dangerousness564. In 
Hungary too, this is seen as a general principle of risk allocation, which is signifi-
cant in particular in respect of liability for auxiliaries565. In England, this criterion 
does not play any great role; it is only mentioned in the context of liability for aux-
iliaries and product liability566.
</p>
<p>Conclusions: while the fact that this criterion has not managed to systemati-
cally and dogmatically permeate English case law so much means there has not 
been any detailed discussion there, it is unlikely that there will be any resistance 
to it as a basic principle that may play a role when recognising certain types of li-
ability.
</p>
<p>VII.  Insurability and having insurance cover
</p>
<p>The possibility of inexpensive  insurability of the insurance risk plays a decisive 
role in France when affirming a strict, no-fault based liability of parents for the 
damage caused by their children567. In Poland568 too, insurability is seen as a rel-
evant factor when introducing no-fault based liability. Whether there is in fact in-
surance coverage in the specific case, on the other hand, is held to be irrelevant 
when affirming liability, except in cases of liability on grounds of equity in which 
the financial situation is taken into account. In Hungary569, by comparison, there 
is noticeably more willingness to award compensation when the damage is  cov-
ered by  liability  insurance.  In England570, no significance is accorded to whether 
there is insurance cover; nothing is said about insurability. In the USA571, insura-
bility has played a role in structuring product liability but also in abolishing &raquo; fam-
ily immunity &laquo;, as claims among members of a family are often covered by insur-
ance anyway.
</p>
<p>Conclusions: It may be common that courts show greater willingness to award 
compensation claims when damage is  covered by insurance. In principle, how-

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>ever, it must be borne in mind that liability insurance policies may not be allowed 
in themselves to give rise to compensation claims, but only to cover compensa-
tion duties that exist independently of the insurance cover. In particular in case of 
doubt, however, it will be very difficult to prevent existing liability insurance poli-
cies being taken into consideration.
</p>
<p>It seems reasonable that insurability572 and thus the notion of &raquo; loss spreading &laquo; 
can become relevant in respect of introducing no-fault based elements of liability 
in that it influences the assessment of whether liability is reasonable.
</p>
<p>VIII.  Risk community
</p>
<p>The notion of risk communities certainly plays a role in Hungary and reference is 
also made to its importance in respect of product liability573. In English law, on the 
other hand, this idea is not generally taken into consideration574.
</p>
<p>In their US report575, which concentrates on product liability and liability for 
road traffic accidents, Green / Cardi point out, firstly, that markets are often divided 
because some consumers buy safe and others less safe products and thus there 
is no risk community; and, secondly, that people with larger incomes often suffer 
far greater loss of income due to injuries and therefore receive larger compensa-
tion payments, so that ultimately the poorer segments of society financially sup-
port the richer since they pay the same price but receive almost no compensation 
if injured. Such redistribution via product liability would not seem to be very just 
or desirable. But I am not so sure that Green&rsquo;s and Cardi&rsquo;s objections are justified: 
Their argumentation is convincing only if you solely take regard of one and the 
same product; but usually rich people buy products which are more expensive 
and I assume that they therefore ultimately pay a higher contribution to the en-
trepreneur&rsquo;s &raquo; liability funds &laquo;. Therefore, I feel that it is &ndash; at least roughly &ndash; a justly 
designed risk community.
</p>
<p>Green&rsquo;s and Cardi&rsquo;s ultimately not convincing concerns about product liabil-
ity do call to mind, however, that here in Europe we have different compensation

</p>
<p>systems which exist alongside each other, which are directed at the compensation 
of the same damage but include different risk communities and therefore also exert 
different redistributive effects and moreover, recourse rights in turn lead to redis-
tribution in another direction. This is shown most clearly in relation to damage 
resulting from road traffic accidents: personal injuries are largely covered by so-
cial security, to which people with higher incomes pay higher contributions and 
these are the same individuals who suffer greater loss of income. Further, there is 
strict liability covered by compulsory liability insurance policies, in which context 
those who keep larger and thus more expensive motor vehicles also pay higher 
premiums, so that here too there is by no means the redistribution from poor to 
rich complained of by Green / Cardi. Moreover, when the accident is caused by a 
defect in the motor vehicle, there is also the strict liability &ndash; which is possibly also 
covered by liability insurance &ndash; of the producer functioning as a type of insurance 
centre, whereby the price structures and thus the distribution of the liability sums 
will be difficult to understand. However, it may be assumed that the purchasers 
of more expensive vehicles also pay greater contributions to the liability fund, so 
that once again the redistribution in the direction feared by Green / Cardi,  from 
low-earners to high-earners, does not take place. Nonetheless, there are in any 
case three different risk communities with different rules on contributions and 
thus different redistributive effects, which may be altered again by the possibility 
of recourse claims.
</p>
<p>This is certainly not a pleasing, economically well-structured, inexpensive 
overall system that coherently implements the notion of a risk community. There-
fore, it would be necessary to consider how to align the competing compensation 
systems, whereby the above-described ( no 8 / 74 f ) Scandinavian approach deserves 
attention.
</p>
<p>IX.  The interplay of imputation criteria
</p>
<p>More attention should certainly be paid to the interplay of the criteria for imputa-
tion in those legal systems in which more regard is had to the overall system; this 
is less likely in common law countries. In the Continental European reports, how-
ever, the interweaving of the different criteria for imputation are not discussed in 
very great detail but in Norway and Hungary it is at least taken into consideration576.

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>The US report even gives the impression that recognising the interplay is diffi-
cult577: it is very obvious that a reversal of the burden of proof is not only provided 
for as regards fault but also that it can be used to pursue different aims and this is 
not disputed in any way. In Basic Questions I578, however, the issue was precisely 
the interplay of the two elements of fault and dangerousness. If some legal sys-
tems provide for a reversal of the burden of proof as regards fault on the basis of 
increased dangerousness, this means even presumed and not only proven fault is 
sufficient to found liability, which is undoubtedly a more stringent form of fault-
based liability, which is provided for precisely because of the increased danger579. 
Further, finding that the dangerousness of the situation leads to increased duties 
of care does not mean that liability is no longer dependent on misconduct but 
rather it merely shows that the element of dangerousness already plays a role even 
within the context of fault-based liability in that it increases the duties of care and 
thus intensifies liability to a certain extent. If attempts are further made to con-
ceal this fact by maintaining that &raquo; reasonableness &laquo; is the applicable yardstick as 
regards duty of care, this invocation of that largely empty phrase in reality tells us 
nothing; when it is elaborated that it is precisely the increased dangerousness that 
render the increased duties of care &raquo; reasonable &laquo;, this helps towards recognising 
the material factors and thus towards understanding decisions. The case-by-case 
examination familiar in the common law is also reflected when it is pointed out 
that the notion of enterprise liability only plays a role in the case of product liabil-
ity, but it is not further considered whether the basic principles ought to lead to a 
broader scope in order to comply with the principle of equal treatment. When the 
difficulty of proving proof is ultimately cited as a justification for strict product li-
ability, it may generally be countered that typically there is no fault in cases of run-
aways and apart from this, such difficulty can hardly justify strict liability but only 
an intensification of liability by a reversal of burden of proof, ie the presumption 
of fault. When, beyond this, the especial dangerousness of the defective product 
is cited as a reason for the strict liability, this does address a decisive idea, namely 
increased danger; when limited to such cases, no-fault based liability could be jus-
tified. Ultimately, it seems to me that the US law can certainly offer valuable start-
ing points for reconsidering the European approach to product liability.

<p>causal theories must be rejected, more weight should be accorded than has been 
hitherto to the case, elaborating all the relevant factors in establishing liability in 
the interest of achieving a consistent, fair overall system; however, more attention 
also needs to be paid to the interplay of these factors. Innovative ideas as regards 
the interplay of several liability factors can certainly be found in the legal systems, 
but as yet these have not led to any coherent system. The justification for produc-
ers&rsquo; liability, for example, the idea that advantage and risk should fall to the same 
party, in combination with the element of &ndash; albeit minor &ndash; danger posed by defects 
and the existence of a risk community, should be called to mind; this seems to 
be an approach worthy of being generalised. In France, the strict liability of par-
ents for the damage caused by their children is based on the somewhat increased 
danger posed by children as well but also on the inexpensive insurability of this 
liability risk.

<p>X.  The contributory responsibility of the victim
</p>
<p>A.  Comparative review
</p>
<p>It is generally accepted today that the contributory fault of the victim leads to an 
apportionment of the damage580. In the USA, the long-standing adherence to the 
rule that contributory fault meant the victim lost the entire claim to compensa-
tion still exerts its influence today in that it apparently still applies if the victim &raquo; is 
more than 50 % at fault &laquo;581. However, it is not entirely clear what this means since 
both tortfeasor and victim are at fault in this case and there is not simply a certain 
percentage of fault; furthermore, as both of them have set a conditio sine qua non 
for the entire damage, it is also not possible from a causation perspective to divide 
up the causality by percent. This probably means, as in German law which takes as 
its premise the likewise indeterminable predominant causation, that the overall 
weight of the grounds for imputation, ie in particular the gravity of the fault and 
adequacy, are material582.

<p>810 Helmut&emsp;Koziol&emsp; &emsp; Comparative conclusions
</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>It is sometimes clearly recognised that as a rule the contributory fault of the 
victim has a different quality than the fault of the injuring party since the vic-
tim usually does not act wrongfully583 in being negligent as regards his own inter-
ests584. Likewise, it is also recognised that not only the fault of the victim but also 
other factors that can trigger liability when others suffer damage must be taken 
into account, for instance the dangerousness of things585 or special risks within 
someone&rsquo;s own sphere ( for example predispositions that lead to a greater risk of 
injury586 ).
</p>
<p>While there is hardly any deeper analysis of the fundamental problems con-
nected with contributory responsibility587, in particular in connection with the 
principle of casum sentit dominus and the fact that the victim normally has not 
acted wrongfully in endangering himself588, nonetheless a certain difference in 
how the injuring party and the victim are treated can be discerned589. The discus-
sion of these basic questions can be of import in those legal systems where there 
is only limited imputation of auxiliaries&rsquo; conduct: as the risk is in the victim&rsquo;s 
sphere, much can be said for the argument that he can be held accountable for all 
misconduct by the auxiliaries he has deployed when they carry out the activities 
he had engaged them to do and the narrow limits for the imputation of auxiliaries&rsquo; 
behaviour in the case of damage to third parties cannot be drawn here590.
</p>
<p>Worthy of note is the accepted difference in some legal systems between inju-
ries to the highest-ranking goods ( life and health ) and other goods ( eg property ): 
in the interest of protecting the victim, no or only minor reductions to the com-
pensation claim is recognised in the case of bodily injuries591. This is particularly 
surprising when &ndash; as in Norway &ndash; personal injury is largely covered by social secu-
rity law anyway and thus there is in fact a far reduced need to protect the victim 
in this respect.
</p>
<p>583 It is the result of a misunderstanding if in the US report no 6 / 169 the interpretation is that Ba-
sic Questions I, no 6 / 204 contends that the contributory responsibility of the victim requires 
that his conduct also renders him liable vis-&agrave;-vis third parties. The point cited was intended to 
explain that the careless behaviour of the victim must be of such nature that, if it was engaged 
in vis-&agrave;-vis third parties&rsquo; interests, it would trigger liability.

<p>B.  Conclusions
</p>
<p>Due to a lack of clarity as regards the basic questions, there are still very consider-
able differences despite fundamental consensus. Debate is needed above all on 
the fact that the behaviour of the victim is generally not wrongful and on the role 
that the casum sentit dominus principle plays. This question is particularly im-
portant as regards the imputation of auxiliaries&rsquo; conduct or of particular sources 
of danger within the sphere of the victim. Clarification is also needed as regards 
the relationship between liability based on dangerousness, on the one hand, and 
contributory fault, on the other. In Basic Questions I ( no 6 / 210 ff ) I described in 
more detail my own view, which takes into account the principle that everyone 
must bear the risks of his own sphere himself.

<p> Part 7  Limitation of liability
</p>
<p>I.  Comparative law review
</p>
<p>Imputation of all damage that is caused in the sense of the conditio sine qua non 
formula or the but-for test is considered too far-ranging in all legal systems592 &ndash; 
even in France albeit with a certain amount of reticence593 &ndash; both in respect of 
fault and strict liability594, and thus additional criteria based on value judgements 
are applied. These are often integrated in a rather confusing manner into the ex-
amination of causation595, though sometimes at least the terms &raquo; legal &laquo; or &raquo; norma-
tive &laquo; causation are used in order to draw the distinction with &raquo; natural &laquo; causation. 
In some legal systems &ndash; in a similar fashion to the German legal family &ndash; the ad-
equacy criterion is applied596; in some this is done separately597 or is somewhat in-
termingled598 with the aspect of the protective purpose of the infringed rule of con-
duct, which is nothing other than the result of teleological interpretation. In the 
common law, courts often examine whether the damage is too &raquo; remote &laquo;, which is 
largely equivalent to the adequacy test599, though the &raquo; harm-within-the-risk rule &laquo; 
is also drawn on and corresponds largely to the notion of protective purpose600.

</p>
<p>While adequacy is predominantly based on the foreseeability of the damage601 
and on the &raquo; normality of the damage &laquo; in Poland602, additional criteria are often 
also applied. Thus, in Norway603 the courts examine whether the damage is suf-
ficiently closely linked with the legally protected interests of the claimant, which 
can be particularly important regarding damage to third parties.
</p>
<p>It is also worthy of note that the boundary of imputability is understood as be-
ing elastic and can be extended in the case of very grave grounds for liability, such 
as intention604.
</p>
<p>It is still common to speak of an interruption of the causal link605, but increas-
ingly it is being recognised that this is a value judgement on the limitation of im-
putation and is not a causation problem606. In fact this often concerns cases in 
which there is an intervening, unprovoked, act by a third party607.
</p>
<p>Limits on the amount of liability are not very common outside of the German le-
gal family608. In the USA609 they are, however, increasingly being recognised when 
this seems necessary considering the expense involved in liability insurance; this 
is true in particular for non-pecuniary damage in cases of medical liability. None-
theless, it has not yet been possible to prove whether this is an effective way to re-
duce the costs of insurance.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it is possible to summarise the situation by noting that, in the con-
text of limiting the imputation of damage, there is in fact wide-ranging consensus, 
but that there are terminological and systematic differences that make communi-
</p>
<p>601 Basic Questions I, no 7 / 7 refers to the basic notion of controllability of the risk, which is 
stressed in particular by Larenz, and which does not apply if the danger is very remote and 
atypical so that no perpetrator would have been prompted to adapt his conduct with it in 
mind. In the US report, it is inferred ( Green / Cardi, USA no 6 / 181 ) that a person who keeps a 
weapon carelessly and as a result it ends up in the hands of unauthorised persons, is not liable 
for the damage which the unauthorised users cause with it because the shots were no longer 
controllable by the owner of the weapon once it was removed from his possession. However, 
this is obviously a misunderstanding of the adequacy theory: naturally the crux is not whether 
the owner could prevent the shot but that he could have prevented the unauthorised use in 
the first place and the clearly foreseeably dangerous situation that resulted by not storing the 
weapon carefully.

<p>cation difficult. It should, however, be possible to eliminate these obstacles with-
out undue difficulty and achieve consensus on the main issues.
</p>
<p>II.   The special problem of lawful alternative conduct
</p>
<p>One area where the protective purpose theory comes into play is the special prob-
lem of lawful alternative conduct. In Basic Questions I no 7 / 22, some well known 
examples are mentioned in illustrating the problem: a car driver overtakes a cy-
clist leaving too little space as he does so and crashes into him, but the same dam-
age would have occurred had he allowed enough space as the cyclist was drunk 
and did not keep to his side of the road, instead lurching out far into the middle. 
Very often debate turns on situations where a doctor operates ( without medical 
malpractice ) on a patient without adequately informing him of the risks involved, 
but disadvantageous consequences ensue and the doctor defends himself against 
the patient&rsquo;s compensation claim by saying the patient would have consented to 
the procedure in any case had he been properly informed and the same negative 
results would have ensued. A case where a trade union started a strike without 
observing the stipulated waiting period of five days intended for negotiations at-
tracted a great deal of attention in Germany; the union&rsquo;s defence against the com-
pensation claims was that the negotiations would certainly have failed. A further 
example is where a police officer kept a suspect in detention following arrest with-
out permission to extend the suspect&rsquo;s detention; in the proceedings for state li-
ability the state&rsquo;s defence was that the competent judge would have ordered the 
arrest in any case.
</p>
<p>It is only rarely recognised that this concerns problems related to the protec-
tive purpose or the connection between the wrongfulness and the result, ie what 
is known in common law as legal causation610; the cases are usually handled as 
a problem of natural causation611. Addressing the hypothetical case of the driver 
overtaking a cyclist, Green / Cardi see &raquo; no difficulty with resolving that case on the 
grounds of factual cause. To ask the counter-factual inquiry required for factual 
case &ndash; would the outcome be different if the tortious conduct had not occurred ? &ndash; 
the answer is plainly no. Since the tortious conduct was leaving insufficient space 
and since even if the driver had left sufficient space the same harm would have 
occurred, the driver&rsquo;s tort is not a factual cause of the harm. Thus, the driver is 
not liable because factual cause is absent &ndash; it would have happened anyway. &laquo; How-
ever, this result is startling: the cyclist suddenly lies seriously injured on the street

</p>
<p>without any cause ! It seems far more logical to say that the motorist, by knocking 
down the cyclist, created the factual cause of the injuries both in the sense of the 
conditio sine qua non formula and in the sense of the but-for test: he factually 
knocked down the cyclist. Moreover: if the motorist &ndash; as would likewise have been 
a very possible option &ndash; had either not overtaken or done so leaving even more 
space than is required under the traffic regulations, or done so very slowly, the 
damage would not have occurred.
</p>
<p>The surprising conclusion that the actual knocking down of the cyclist is not 
a cause of his injuries is arrived at because, in terms of causation, Green / Cardi ex-
amine not only whether the defendant&rsquo;s conduct actually led to the damage but 
also combine this with an examination of wrongfulness in that they compare the 
actual wrongful behaviour with one particular lawful alternative course of con-
duct. Specifically, they emphasise: &raquo; Necessary for any factual causal inquiry is a 
counter-factual hypothetical inquiry: what would have happened in the world if 
the defendant had not engaged in the tortious conduct ? &laquo; Thus, ultimately it is 
only examined whether the knocking down is connected with the wrongfulness 
of the actual conduct. However, this actually makes it clear that in fact there is no 
fundamental departure from the view that this is a question of the connection be-
tween the wrongfulness and the result; there is simply a different conceptual frame-
work and terminology. To pin down the true problem and the diversity of issues, 
it would, however, certainly be helpful if it were also terminologically clarified that 
the issue here is the connection between result and wrongfulness &ndash; and thus the 
purpose of the rule &ndash; and not factual causation; if possible, different prerequisites 
for liability should also be accurately distinguished.
</p>
<p>This aim is supported by countries within the German legal family; when cau-
sation is being examined in terms of &raquo; natural &laquo; causation, on the basis of the con-
ditio sine qua non formula, only the active conduct under discussion is imagined 
away, without any other hypothetical event being imagined in its stead612: if the 
driver&rsquo;s overtaking is imagined away &ndash; without imagining other conduct instead &ndash; 
the cyclist would not have been knocked down.
</p>
<p>However, Green / Cardi have given me very valuable food for thought with their 
line of argument as regards reconsidering the causation question once again. 
Thus, I have asked whether it is right and proper simply to imagine away the event 
at issue, as is usual in the German legal family and beyond613, without imagining 
another event instead. An argument against this would seem to be that, when ex-
amining causation, the actual event must be compared with a hypothetical event, 
the question being whether this hypothetical event would have led to the damage

<p>at issue or not. In respect of this hypothetical occurrence, it must be remembered 
that, if one event had not happened, this would probably not have been the end 
of it but instead another event could have taken place. In our example, the driver 
could have driven past leaving the legally required space or even more space; he 
could have reduced his speed so much that the cyclist was no longer in danger; he 
could have warned the cyclist and told him to stop or he could have waited before 
driving on so that the cyclist would already have been on a safe part of the road 
by the time he was overtaken. However, it is not possible to determine accurately 
how events would otherwise have turned out. It certainly seems problematic that 
Green / Cardi draw just on one particular course of conduct, namely driving past 
and leaving the legally required amount of space, as the one and only fixed hypo-
thetical possibility when examining causation, although there are almost innu-
merable variations conceivable614. Of these imaginable hypothetical happenings, 
some would also have led to the same damage, others to less damage and others 
again would not have caused any damage. Given this rich diversity of alternatives, 
surely not only precisely the one hypothetical course of conduct that is most fa-
vourable for the defendant &ndash; because it would negate causation &ndash; should be picked 
out and taken as a premise. It would be equally conceivable for the driver to have 
overtaken the cyclist but to have left even less space in so doing; this course would 
not lead to any relief from liability for the defendant. Rather it must be questioned 
whether it is decisive that the cyclist&rsquo;s injury was avoidable in the abstract, ie the 
damage did not necessarily have to occur one way or the other. Hence, imagining 
all conceivable, hypothetical scenarios could possibly only be relevant insofar as 
causation is negated if all other variations would also have led to the same dam-
age, ie this damage was unavoidable. Then, and only then, would the liability of 
the defendant not come into question because the damage would not even have 
been avoidable in an abstract sense and thus, it would no longer be justifiable to 
impute it to the driver615. As the imputation of damage is material, depending on 
whether the defendant could have avoided the damage, it must be sufficient for 
determining causation and thus imputation of the damage that other alternatives 
that would not have led to the same damage were theoretically possible, ie the 
damage was avoidable. Proceeding from this premise, it is also logical that no one 
particular, more or less random, other course of conduct can be picked out as the 
relevant hypothetical event for the comparison and as decisive for the determina-
tion of whether the damage would have been sustained in any case. On the other 
hand, it must be noted that, when evaluating any specific conduct, causation can-
not be negated simply because it is conceivable that another, purely hypothetical

<p>event would have led to the same damage: if this were the decisive point, imputa-
tion of active conduct would practically never be possible because it would always 
be possible to imagine other events that could have led to the damage at the same 
time or in the near or distant future. In our example, it would also be possible to 
conceive of a hypothetical occurrence &ndash; as already described &ndash; where the defend-
ant drives even more closely to the cyclist or the very next motorist behind him 
knocks the drunken cyclist down and the same damage would have resulted. If 
the prerequisite of natural causation is to remain manageable, such, purely theo-
retical, infinitely variable hypotheses must be considered irrelevant and only real 
happenings can be decisive616. Thus, we can observe as follows: the  real  trigger 
of the damage combined with the finding that bringing about said damage was 
avoidable, as can be determined by imagining away the conduct of the defend-
ant, is material. Purely theoretical, hypothetical events cannot lead to a negation 
of natural causation in respect of an event that actually brought about avoidable 
damage; a purely imaginary, hypothetical course of conduct cannot serve to deter-
mine what actually happened617. All other considerations regarding limitations of 
imputation based on value judgements no longer fall within the scope of natural 
causation, but belong to other imputation instruments. Therefore, the cases of 
lawful alternative conduct do not constitute a problem of natural causation but of 
another imputation criterion with the underlying value judgement deriving from 
the protective purpose of the infringed rule, ie in common law so-called legal cau-
sation.
</p>
<p>The considerations inspired by Green / Cardi have led me to change my view 
on omissions, albeit in the opposite direction to the one argued by Green / Cardi: up 
until now I had argued &ndash; as do Green / Cardi &ndash; that, in the case of omissions, the 
defence of lawful alternative conduct leads to a rejection of liability for reasons 
of natural causation. I started from the premise618 that an omission can only be 
causal if taking a certain action would have prevented the occurrence of the dam-
aging result and provided this action would have been possible. I inferred from 
this &ndash; in line with widespread opinion &ndash; that, in the case of omissions, liability 
must indeed be negated due to lack of causation &raquo; if the same harm would also 
have arisen had he taken action in accordance with his duties &laquo;. However, in fact 
</p>
<p>616 This is also the difference &ndash; to be emphasised more strongly than before, see Basic Questions I, 
nos 7 / 23 and 29 f &ndash; to the cases of hypothetical causation in which later, real events are always at 
issue, so that there is certainty as to which events are to be examined. In the cases of lawful al-
ternative conduct, on the other hand, purely hypothetical events that never actually happened 
are under discussion, so that it is not even certain which event would otherwise have occurred 
instead.

<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>it would be more correct even in the case of omissions &ndash; analogous to the above 
arguments &ndash; if a sharper distinction was drawn between the causation and the 
wrongfulness issues: if it would have been possible to prevent the damage by tak-
ing some action, the omission of this action was causal for the damage, even if the 
same damage would have ensued in the case of lawful conduct &ndash; ie if the rescue 
measure had been undertaken in line with duties. The question of whether the 
omission contravened duties and if conduct in line with such duties would have 
been suitable to prevent the occurrence of the damage is once again a question of 
wrongfulness and the connection between result and wrongfulness and does not 
concern so-called natural causation.
</p>
<p>Green / Cardi have thus brought me to the realisation that in the context of 
the problem of lawful alternative conduct, in relation to both active conduct and 
omissions, the issue cannot normally turn on release from liability due to lack of 
natural causation, as such causation must usually be affirmed, but instead liabil-
ity can solely be excluded on other grounds with underlying value judgements. As 
already described619, the issue basically concerns wrongfulness and the connec-
tion between result and wrongfulness or &ndash; more broadly formulated &ndash; the protec-
tive purpose of  the  infringed rule. There is also a substantial advantage to this in 
comparison with the approach based on natural causation in that a more elastic 
criterion is available.
</p>
<p>The prevailing view620, that the defence of possible lawful alternative conduct 
is material and leads to a complete release from liability for the injuring party, is 
still quite right in many cases even when we take this approach: if certain conduct 
is forbidden by the legal system, this is ordinarily with the aim of preventing dam-
age which would otherwise be likely. This goal of preventing damage cannot, how-
ever, be accomplished if the same damage can and is allowed to arise anyway due 
to lawful behaviour. Therefore, it must be concluded that such damage cannot fall 
within the protective scope of the infringed conduct rule since the legal system 
does actually allow such damage to occur.
</p>
<p>Mor&eacute;teau621  reports, however, of contrasting decisions, which reject any re-
lease from liability and argues this by noting: &raquo; the explanation that the rule is not 
so much aimed at preventing damage but instead at excluding certain types of be-
haviour makes sense &laquo;. Very much in line with this, Ludwichowska-Redo622 also ad-
dresses rules that are directed at preventing the infliction of damage in a certain 
way or by certain conduct. This is well in line with the view common within the

</p>
<p>German legal family623 that invoking lawful alternative conduct does not lead to 
a release from liability if the conduct rule was not so much aimed at preventing 
damage but above all at excluding types of conduct or at bringing about compliance 
with certain courses of conduct. If account should be taken here too of the defence 
of lawful alternative conduct, it is argued, this would mean that anyone would be 
able to circumvent the legal path stipulated by the legal system, which may for 
instance include certain safeguards, or &ndash; in particular as in the case of medical 
interventions &ndash; the victim&rsquo;s own, informed decision. This argument places the de-
terrent function firmly in the foreground.
</p>
<p>There is often resistance when in cases like this it is decided not to allow the 
release from liability on the basis of the defence of lawful alternative conduct and 
to award the victim full compensation for the harm which really ensued; how-
ever, this resistance still derives from causation considerations. Green / Cardi and 
Mor&eacute;teau point out, for instance, that in the medical liability example the injury 
to health is not caused by the inadequate information given to the patient if such 
would have decided to have the operation even had he been adequately informed 
and accordingly, the damage would have ensued one way or another. A similar ar-
gument is made where the claimant is detained by a police officer without a war-
rant to extend detention but would have been detained anyway. Therefore, some 
of the original examples will be discussed in the following lines on the basis of 
new considerations and counter-arguments.
</p>
<p>In the case of the cyclist there were certainly alternative forms of conduct pos-
sible that would have led to an avoidance of the injury to the cyclist; therefore, 
pursuant to the considerations above, it can be assumed that the motorist caused 
the damage. There are, however, no grounds for departing from the general con-
sideration that the damage which actually occurred does not lie within the protec-
tive scope of the infringed rule of conduct,if it could also have ensued in the case 
of lawful conduct anyway.
</p>
<p>In the case of medical  liability, there must be better distinction than has ex-
isted up to now between the infringement of the duty to inform and carrying out 
the operation inadmissibly due to a lack of sufficient information. The damage 
which occurred during the course of the operation without any malpractice by the 
doctor and which thus could be deemed a chance event in this particular respect 
is always in the foreground of the discussion. It is undisputed, however, that the 
doctor caused the damage if the patient would have decided against the operation 
had he been fully informed and thus the consequential damage would not have 
occurred; on the basis of the wrongfulness of the procedure without effective con-
sent, there is no doubt in this case about the liability of the doctor. The difficul-

</p>
<p>ties begin, however, when the patient would also have decided in favour of the op-
eration had he been properly informed, as in this case the consequential damage 
would also have occurred. In the light of the above discussion, it may be assumed 
that the operating surgeon also caused the coincidentally negative results by car-
rying out the &ndash; inadmissible &ndash; operation. Furthermore, it can once again be as-
sumed that the legal systems do not aim at sanctioning actions that do not lead to 
any increase of risk as compared to lawful conduct. Accordingly, the inadmissibil-
ity of the operation should not trigger full liability for the coincidentally negative 
results624 in the light of the protective purpose consideration if the patient would 
have been exposed to the same risk had the operation been carried out admissibly.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it must be remembered in the context of medical liability cases 
that the failure to inform the patient fully or accurately also infringes the right to &ndash; 
informed &ndash; self-determination. Accordingly, in France625, the notion that above all a 
certain type of conduct should be prevented by the infringed rule is emphasised 
in cases of inadequate information by doctors and thus, in any case &ndash; ie even if the 
patient would have consented to the procedure had he been informed properly 
and therefore would also have sustained the damage to his health &ndash; non-pecuni-
ary damages are recoverable; this approach takes as its premise the infringement 
of the personality right to self-determination after obtaining a sufficient basis for 
such consent. Green / Cardi626 also agree that one should take infringement of self-
determination as the premise and compensate the damage caused by this627. This 
damage is, however, very different from the impairment of health, namely non-pe-
cuniary harm caused by the infringement of the right to self-determination. This 
seems to be a persuasive approach, but it remains to be examined whether the 
breach of the duty to inform could not also trigger liability for the negative results 
of the operation &ndash; though in this precise respect there is no fault. It must, however, 
also be borne in mind that firstly if the patient would have opted for the operation, 
there would thus have been the same random risk of a negative nature. Further-
more, it must be taken into account that the requirement of consent based on suf-
ficient information does not aim at the avoidance of additional risks; such risks 
can undoubtedly be better assessed by the surgeon rather than by the patient. The 
requirement to obtain consent as serving instead to preserve the right to self-de-
termination and thus also as faciliting the decision to take or not to take a certain

<p>risk. If, however, the patient would have accepted the risk of the operation even 
had he been fully informed, no additional, undesired risk has been occasioned 
to him by contravention of the right to self-determination. Therefore, in turn, it 
can be assumed that the legal system does not aim to provide for full liability628 if 
there was no increase in risk due to the wrongful conduct and the patient would 
have suffered and had to bear the same harm even had he been properly informed. 
However, as Green / Cardi and Mor&eacute;teau point out629, there is still the damage that 
occurred precisely because of the infringement of the right to self-determination 
and which would not have occurred had the patient been properly informed: this 
is non-pecuniary harm that was caused by the breach of a fundamental personal-
ity right. Hence, it is in any case recoverable if the breach of the duty to inform 
was culpable630.
</p>
<p>Finally, we look at the case of detention that is wrongful because there is no 
court order for its extension. This is a classic example of when the infringed rule 
of conduct is not so much aimed at preventing the damage but above all at pre-
cluding a certain type of conduct or securing compliance with a certain procedure; 
therefore, invoking the lawful alternative conduct defence may not lead to any re-
lease from liability. The starting point of the considerations must be that, while 
taking the person into custody was admissible, nevertheless within a certain pe-
riod of time a court order for the continuation of the detention ought to have been 
obtained or alternatively the person ought to have been released. The continued 
detention was avoidable and was factually caused by the authority that carried out 
the inadmissible detention. In favour of the duty to compensate and not allowing 
the lawful alternative conduct defence, it can be argued that the legal system has 
provided for a special procedure in order to safeguard the interests of the detainee 
and failure to comply with this procedure certainly increases the risk of inadmis-
sible detention, ie a very substantial harm. Even if it is established that the court 
would have allowed the continued detention because all the legal prerequisites 
were fulfilled, it is nonetheless more appropriate to consider that the legal system 
did not aim at avoiding the detention in itself but only at avoiding prolonged de-
tention without a court order and all the negative consequences of not obtaining 
such court order in good time. Such negative consequences could, for instance, be 
an extension of the deprivation of liberty or the non-pecuniary damage that arises 
due to non-compliance with the procedural regulations in respect of suspects. Any 
loss of earnings, however, which would also have ensued had there been a court

<p>order, do not appear recoverable &ndash; at least not in full631. Nonetheless, it is undeni-
able that something can also be said for the view that since the law was aimed at 
avoiding any and all such non-authorised detention, all harm brought about by 
such detention is recoverable when the stipulated procedure is not complied with 
and, accordingly, the detention was wrongful. In this case, however, it would also 
have to be considered whether the continued detention with a court order that the 
victim is spared as a result, because it is no longer necessary, is to be set off as an 
advantage, which ultimately could lead to the same result.
</p>
<p>A frequently discussed aspect in the context of the &raquo; lawful alternative con-
duct &laquo; problem is the difficulties that the victim would likely encounter in respect 
of  evidence  if he had to prove the imagined hypothetical course of events. How 
should, for instance, a patient prove that he would have decided against having 
the operation had he been properly informed by the doctor and thus not have sus-
tained the damage ? Difficulties arise in particular when hypothetical decisions 
in the past are under discussion, which in many cases cannot be proven. While 
the approach presented here cannot eliminate the difficulties of proof, it at least 
means that the burden of proof is imposed largely on the defendant and thus the 
victim&rsquo;s compensation claim becomes enforceable: if the issue is that the dam-
age lies outside the protective scope of the rule infringed, the defendant must in-
voke this as his defence against liability and therefore also prove that the damage 
would also have arisen in the case of lawful alternative conduct. Thus, the defend-
ant has the difficulty of proving the imagined alternative course of events. This 
approach is supported by Karollus&rsquo; convincing argument that the party who has 
acted in a wrongful manner that increases a risk, must bear the entire risk of prov-
ing this, that means the burden of proof lies with him so that he must prove that 
the increase of risk had no effect in the case at issue632. The division of the burden 
of proof at the expense of the party who acted wrongfully can certainly be justi-
fied with reference to penal and deterrence notions: behaviour that is dangerous 
and also presents difficulties insofar as proof is concerned should indeed be pre-
vented; the risk that it cannot be proved is better borne by the party who generated 
it by acting wrongfully than by the victim.
</p>

further question of whether apportionment of damage would be appropriate in the circum-
stances &ndash; see on this Basic Questions I, no 7 / 29 ff.

<p> Part 8 The compensation of the damage
</p>
<p>I.  Comparative review
</p>
<p>As already highlighted above ( no 8 / 29 ), the law of damages in the Continental Eu-
ropean sense cannot be equated with the whole law of torts under common law, 
but only with those torts that require the occurrence of damage and are directed 
at compensating the damage caused. All other torts, which either do not require the 
existence of damage or do not provide for compensatory damages, but instead for 
example for injunctions or penalties are either in terms of prerequisites or legal 
consequences and thus in regard of their decisive function not comparable with 
the Continental European laws of damages and therefore are not included here.
</p>
<p>In respect of the law of damages and the corresponding torts of the common 
law that serve the function of compensating damage caused, the principle of full 
compensation &ndash; but no more633 &ndash; is emphasised everywhere634; reference is made to 
the departure from this in the field of liability based on grounds of equity635. PETL 
( art 10: 101 ) also stress the task of compensation: &raquo; to compensate the victim, that 
is to say, to restore him as far as money can, to the position he would have been in 
if the wrong complained of had not been committed. &laquo; Art VI.&ndash;6: 101 DCFR uses a 
similar formulation.
</p>
<p>In respect of French law, Mor&eacute;teau636 comes to the conclusion that the prin-
ciple of full compensation is emphasised but ultimately it is by no means always 
observed in practice and that the extent of compensation ultimately seems to de-
pend also on the gravity of the grounds for imputation at hand. That there be a 
connection between the weight of the grounds for imputation and the extent of 
the compensation would seem absolutely appropriate637. It does not seem advis-
able, however, to make the extent of compensation solely dependant on the de-
gree of fault, as is stipulated in Austria by the Civil Code ( ABGB ). This meets with 
increasing criticism even in Austria638 and is rejected in other countries639: taking

<p>fault as a sole premise and not the entirety of the grounds for imputation as well 
as the interests at stake is much too one-sided and rigid. On the other hand, ad-
justing the compensation on the basis of comprehensive value judgements and a 
normative assessment of the damage would be appropriate640.
</p>
<p>In the German legal family, restitution in kind has primacy under law; the same 
applies in Hungary641. When it is pointed out that in Poland the victim has the 
choice, this does not make much practical difference since even in the German 
legal family it is argued that restitution in kind should serve the interests of the 
victim and thus such can also seek to have monetary damages instead, unless this 
would be unreasonably burdensome for the injuring party642. Art 10: 104 PETL also 
corresponds to the Polish model. In French law, restitution in kind is not given 
any precedence but it is often provided for by the courts643. This would seem to 
correspond to the rule in the DCFR ( art VI.&ndash;6: 101 para 2 ): the type of compensa-
tion to be awarded is that which is appropriate having regard to the circumstances. 
In English law, restitution in kind is unknown644, which corresponds to the gen-
eral tendency also seen in contract law to give the obligee a claim only to money645. 
Apart from the rather astonishing exception of restoration of honour, restitution 
in kind is not provided for in Japan either646.
</p>
<p>The concept of objective damage is especially defended in Austria647, but it is 
also recognised in Polish648 and in some instances in Japanese649 law, thus facili-
tating the determination of the minimum damage caused to the claimant. In Eng-
lish law it seems that objective assessment based on market value is usually ap-
plied650.
</p>
<p>In the case of permanent damage, a one-off lump-sum payment is preferred in 
Norway, England and the USA as well as in Japan, but for special reasons an an-
nuity may be awarded651. In Poland, on the other hand, the payment of an annu-
ity is generally stipulated except in the case of non-pecuniary damage652, and in

<p>825Part 8&emsp; &emsp; The&emsp;compensation&emsp;of&emsp;the&emsp;damage
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>Hungary the courts decide on the type of compensation653, but annuity payments 
predominate.
</p>
<p>The compensation can be reduced for very special reasons in Norway and Po-
land654, and both PETL ( art 10: 401 ) and the DCFR ( art VI.&ndash;6: 202 ) propose this, 
whereby above all the financial situation of both sides must be taken into consid-
eration; in France there is increasing support for such a possibility655. In England 
and the USA as well as in Japan, on the other hand, no reduction clause comes into 
discussion; reference is made to the insolvency rule656.
</p>
<p>II.  Conclusions
</p>
<p>There is consensus on the essential issue that the responsible injuring party must 
in principle pay full compensation &ndash; no less, but also no more.
</p>
<p>As far as restitution in kind is concerned, the European Group on Tort Law was 
able to reach agreement to the effect that restitution in kind should in principle 
be provided for within the framework of an appropriately limited consideration of 
the interests of the victim ( art 10: 104 PETL )657. This balanced approach could well 
meet with general agreement.
</p>
<p>Mor&eacute;teau658 points out a special type of damage compensation for non-pecu-
niary damage in connection with the discussion of the compensation of minor 
damage. He writes that: &raquo; Many victims are looking for opportunities to make im-
pact statements and obtain public recognition that a wrong was suffered. Where 
there is an infringement to a personality right, such as honour, privacy, or image, 
many a victim would be content with nominal damage, and the publication of a 
statement on the media that infringed the right. Reparation is not exclusively a fi-
nancial matter, especially when it comes to protecting extra-patrimonial rights. &laquo; 
This corresponds to the European Court of Human Rights&rsquo; judgments declaring 
&raquo; satisfaction by finding a violation &laquo;659. The idea that a finding of a violation is in itself

</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>just satisfaction has been justified by Franz Bydlinski660 in qualifying such declara-
tory judgements as a special sort of compensation in kind: &raquo; If and insofar as the 
negative psychological effects of the violation per se are directly concerned, ie the 
injury to the sense of justice, which is naturally very sensitive when it comes to 
someone&rsquo;s personal affairs, &rsaquo; satisfaction &lsaquo; in the strictest sense is obtained for the 
victim in that he is found authoritatively to be in the right, and his opponent to 
be in the wrong, which must cause positive reactions in the victim to counter the 
negative upset about the violation or which come as near as possible to so do-
ing. &laquo; I think it would be very useful to discuss whether minor non-pecuniary loss 
should in general be compensated only by finding a violation: on the one hand, 
the victims receive compensation in kind by such satisfaction, on the other hand, 
not spending considerable sums for compensation of insignificant non-pecuniary 
loss would help to compensate significant loss in a more satisfactory way than is 
done at present and, in addition, to reduce the premiums for liability insurance.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, it should not be too difficult to obtain recognition for the objective-
abstract assessment of damage, which is championed in implementing the notion 
of continuation of a right ( Rechtsfortwirkungsgedanken ), in particular referring 
to the market value of a thing in order to arrive at the minimum damage to be 
compensated. The European Group on Tort Law has already taken on this concept 
after detailed debate ( art 10: 201 PETL )661 and thus has also made a contribution 
towards activating the deterrent function of the law of damage662.
</p>
<p>It should also be possible to find consensus regarding the flexible provision 
of periodic payments or lump-sum compensation ( art 10: 102 )663 taking into account 
the interests of the victim.
</p>
<p>The  reduction  clause met with strong resistance even within the European 
Group on Tort Law664 and will probably trigger debate once again at the global 
level, the outcome of which is impossible to predict. I tried to explain why I believe 
that precisely the law of damages needs such a flexible possibility for the reduc-
tion of the obligation in exceptional cases in Basic Questions I ( no 8 / 24 ff ). It only 
remains to be said that the horror scenarios expressed in the country reports as 
regards the consideration of the economic capacity to bear the burden certainly 
have no foundation and, therefore, do not serve objective discussion. This applies

<p>in particular in respect of the fear expressed in the US report665: &raquo; That argument 
appears to us to be one for unadorned wealth shifting &ndash; money provided to those 
who are poor can help them more than leaving the money with someone wealth-
ier. Such an argument, if accepted, might entitle a victim of a catastrophic loss to 
seek payment from another even though that individual is not liable in tort for the 
loss. &laquo; The reduction clause clearly does not lead to any foundation for liability that 
would not otherwise exist due simply to the wealth of the defendant but at most, 
in rare cases and under careful consideration of the interests worth protecting on 
both sides, it leads to a reduction of liability that is based on the general rules.

<p> Part 9 Prescription of compensation claims
</p>
<p>I.  Comparative review
</p>
<p>The national rules on prescription offer a great diversity of different prescription 
periods. This is not very surprising insofar as it is not possible to weigh up the in-
terests involved exactly when setting such periods; thus, there is a great deal of lee-
way when it comes to determining prescription periods, which ought to be appro-
priate in extremely variable life circumstances666. Hence, as there are no in-depth 
questions of conviction to be resolved in this respect, it should hardly be impos-
sible to reach international consensus on certain periods that seem appropriate.
</p>
<p>However, it is certainly possible that even a rough assessment of whether very 
long or rather shorter periods are necessary is connected in fact with fundamen-
tal issues, about which it has not yet been possible to reach any agreement. This 
kind of connection does indeed exist specifically as regards the very significant 
( and practical ) issue of when the prescription period commences, an issue which 
has been resolved in many different ways based on very different underlying value 
judgements, and the duration of the prescription period. The problem of when 
the prescription period should begin indeed proves to likely be the core issue of 
prescription under the law of damages. Hence, it will be discussed in more detail 
and an attempt will be made to arrive at a convincing and thus acceptable resolu-
tion by elaborating upon the fundamental considerations at issue.
</p>
<p>The term of  short,  subjective  prescription periods  is usually linked to the vic-
tim&rsquo;s knowledge of the damage and of the identity of the injuring party, so that 
there are no unanswered questions about when it should commence667. As far as 
long, objective prescription periods are concerned, on the other hand, there is no 
consensus as regards when they begin: sometimes the damaging event is held to 
be material in this respect, sometimes the occurrence of the damage is taken as 
the premise668. If the prescription period begins to run from the moment of the 
</p>
<p>666 This is rightly emphasised by the Hungarian report ( Menyh&aacute;rd, Hungary no 4 / 182 ). Indications 
for the proper duration of the period are attempted from an economic analysis of law perspec-

</p>
<p>damaging event, it may occur &ndash; in particular when it comes to the effects of radia-
tion, chemicals or germs &ndash; that the prescription period ends before the damage 
occurs and the victim has absolutely no chance of obtaining compensation for the 
damage that has only just occurred.
</p>
<p>The problem clearly posed in such cases was addressed in several of the coun-
try reports669; the value judgements applied and approaches taken toward a solu-
tion vary greatly, however. The Hungarian report dwells firstly on one question of 
principles: it rightly points out the conflict between the fundamental rights pro-
tection of property and the prescription of claims670. In considering this aspect, it 
seems natural that Hungary has sufficient regard to the rights of the victim. Ac-
cordingly, the prescription period can never start in Hungary before the damage 
has occurred as prior to this no claim can fall due; therefore, the victim is always 
guaranteed the possibility of asserting his compensation claim, even when the 
harm only emerges after a long time. For the same reasons, this start of the pre-
scription period is also adhered to even in the case of foreseeable future damage. 
French law also takes as its premise for prescription the inactivity of the victim 
and accordingly stipulates that the damage must already have occurred for the 
prescription period to commence so that it is possible for the compensation claim 
to be asserted. In the case of physical injury it even goes one step further and re-
quires the &raquo; consolidation &laquo;, ie the completion of the damage671.
</p>
<p>Besides a short prescription period that starts to run once the victim knows of 
the damage and the identity of the injuring party, Polish law672 recognises a long 
prescription period that runs from the &raquo; occurrence of the damaging event &laquo;. This 
phrase is understood as meaning that the damaging event and not the occurrence 
of the damage is decisive for the commencement of the prescription period673; this 
is the case even though the general provisions expressly state that the prescription 
period only begins to run on the day that the claim arises. The Polish Constitu-
tional Court674 understandably decided that the provision contravened the Con-
stitution as it robbed the victim of any compensation claim. The legislator imple-
mented this finding to an extent in a supplementary provision introduced in 2007,

</p>
<p>according to which the prescription period does not expire any earlier than three 
years after the victim knew of the damage and the identity of the injuring party in 
the case of physical injury675.
</p>
<p>English law also deems the occurrence of the damage a necessary prerequisite 
for the prescription period to start running if the claim requires proven damage; 
only in the case of those &raquo; torts &laquo; which do not require damage to have occurred, for 
example trespass, is the delictual conduct material676. Likewise in the USA677, it is 
maintained that the prescription period can only start to run when the claim has 
arisen, which in turn requires that the damage has occurred. It is true that besides 
the &raquo; statutes of limitation &laquo; there are some &raquo; statutes on repose &laquo;678, which time the 
expiry of the period from a certain event, for instance placing a product on the 
market, without taking account of when the damage occurs. However, criticism 
is currently being levelled precisely against this. For instance, Judge Frank con-
tended in his &raquo; dissenting opinion &laquo; in Dincher v. Marlin Firearms Co679 that: &raquo; Except 
in topsy-turvy land you can&rsquo;t die before you are conceived, or be divorced before 
ever you marry, or harvest a crop never planted, or burn down a house never built, 
or miss a train running on a non-existent railroad. For substantially similar rea-
sons, it has always heretofore been accepted, as a sort of legal &rsaquo;axiom&lsaquo;, that a stat-
ute of limitations does not begin to run against a cause of action before that cause 
of action exists, ie, before a judicial remedy is available to the plaintiff. &laquo;
</p>
<p>It must be remembered680 that &sect; 1478 of the Austrian Civil Code ( ABGB ) 
highlights as a prerequisite for the commencement of the prescription pe-
riod that it would already have been possible to exercise the right. This princi-
ple must mean that prescription of compensation claims can only begin with 
the  occurrence of  the victim&rsquo;s damage: before the damage occurs, the compensa-
tion claim has not yet arisen and thus, it cannot be asserted. This consequence 
is also usually recognised in respect of the long period of prescription; some 
of the literature on this point and the case law, however, disregard this funda-
mental rule and take the view that the long prescription period already starts 
to run as soon as the action giving rise to liability is committed. In Japan681, by 
contrast, the occurrence of the damage is held to be material despite a statu-
tory rule which takes the date of the unauthorised action as the starting point.

<p>831Part 9&emsp; &emsp; Prescription&emsp;of&emsp;compensation&emsp;claims
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>In noteworthy contrast to all of the numerous and also weighty opinions to 
the contrary, &sect; 199 para 2 and para 3 no 2 of the German Civil Code ( BGB ) expressly 
stipulate that the absolute period of 30 years for the prescription of compensation 
claims begins without any consideration of when the claim arises. The period is 
triggered by the action committed, the breach of duty or whatever other event gave 
rise to the damage; ie even before the occurrence of the damage682. Likewise, Swiss 
law takes as the commencement of the absolute 10-year period the date of the 
damaging action and not the occurrence of the damage683.
</p>
<p>In Germany, constitutional concerns have been raised about the possibility 
of prescription before a claim even arises684. On the other hand, however, Zimmer-
mann defends the irrelevance of the occurrence of the damage and the damaging 
event as the material point in time in his investigations. The provision is based 
on extensive, comparative law investigations and also the interplay of social secu-
rity law and the law of damages. He has even proposed &ndash; following the line taken 
by the Principles of European Contract Law &ndash; that the short prescription period 
should also take the damaging event as its starting point and that the impossibil-
ity of detecting the damage should only be recognised as a ground for suspending 
the prescription period. This would ensure a very homogenous law on prescrip-
tion created in order to eliminate the problems of having two independent pre-
scription periods with different starting points and their own terms.
</p>
<p>This is certainly a tempting solution. Nonetheless, I consider that it is nec-
essary to return to the discussion of the fundamental underlying values before 
reaching any final decision, since these values have slipped somewhat into the 
background in my opinion.
</p>
<p>II.  Conclusions685
</p>
<p>As was already pointed out in Basic Questions I ( no 9 / 1 ), it must be taken as a 
premise that the loss of an existing right simply because of the expiry of time, or 
at least the fact that such is rendered unenforceable, is a serious impairment of 
the protection of well-founded rights, the principle of freedom and the theory of 
justice686. Due to this loss of pecuniary assets against the will of the person previ-

</p>
<p>ously entitled, prescription is often referred to as a type of dispossession687; this is 
compounded by the fact that dispossession must serve &raquo; the general best interest &laquo; 
( explicitly stated in &sect; 365 of the Austrian Civil Code, ABGB ), whereas prescription 
benefits one specific obligee without any set-off and does not serve the public in-
terest688. Hence, proceeding solely on these basic principles, the institution of pre-
scription would have to be considered &ndash; as F. Bydlinski  689 emphasises &ndash; a violation 
of legal ethics. However, the fact that the institution of prescription on the basis of 
a victim having had a relatively long time to assert a claim has enjoyed most solid 
recognition everywhere at all times can be explained by reference to other basic 
principles, specifically the requirement of  legal certainty  in general690 as well as 
practicability and economic effectivity691.
</p>
<p>As B.A. Koch692 rightly explains, in principle any claim, once it has arisen, may 
only be prescribed when outweighed by other interests. The decision as to when 
prescription should apply hinges, as Zimmermann693 stresses, on the delicate bal-
ancing of countervailing interests; the dispossession type effect of prescription can 
only be justified &raquo; if, as a rule, the creditor has had a fair chance of pursuing that 
claim &laquo;694. Besides the interests of the defendant, in particular in being protected 
against increasing evidentiary difficulties, unexpected suits and security as to 
what he disposes of, the interests of the general public in timely enforcement of 
rights, peace under law, legal certainty and ensuring that the courts are not over-
burdened by evidentiary diffulties are at issue; but above all of course the inter-
ests of the claimant in being given sufficient opportunity to enforce his rights play 
decisive roles695. The last aspect is formulated by F. Bydlinski  696 as a legal principle 
to the effect that prescription can only begin when the claimant is in fact able to 
exercise the relevant right697.

have the nature of property under art 14 of the Basic Law in Germany ( Grundge-
setz ) and the legislator must thus have regard in an appropriate fashion to the 
suit of the obligee. According to him, this means that the obligee must be given a 
fair chance to assert his claim. He must be given the opportunity to recognise that 
his claim exists, examine its validity, collect evidence and prepare to enforce it in 
court. This postulate can be met either by taking actual or possible identification 
as the starting point or by providing for sufficiently long objective periods. Finally, 
he emphasises that in all cases prescription of the claim before it even arises is ir-
reconcilable with constitutional law principles.
</p>
<p>This viewpoint can certainly be supported by private law and, in particular, 
law of damages&rsquo; values. The arguments by those who defend prescription before 
claims have arisen often create the impression that the priority is not the protec-
tion of the victim otherwise entitled to compensation but of the responsible injur-
ing party: they cite the necessity to protect the obligor against evidentiary difficul-
ties, to protect his entitlement to expect at some point that there will be closure to 
an incident, the public interest in the speedy resolution of legal disputes as well as 
the goal of preventing legal disputes precisely by means of the rules on prescrip-
tion; only at the end is the need to keep the justified suit of the creditor in mind 
also mentioned699. The same tendency can be seen in the statement that the law 
should only interfere with the term of the prescription period to the extent that 
this seems absolutely necessary in order to protect the creditor700.
</p>
<p>It cannot by any means be denied that this brings very important aspects into 
play; however, it seems to me that it leaves one very fundamental idea practically 
unconsidered: as argued in Basic Questions I701, it must be assumed that prescrip-
tion ensues on the basis of the obligee&rsquo;s failure to take timely action to pursue 
an enforceable claim. The failure to act in good time and thus, the possibility of 
blameworthy misconduct on the part of the compensable claimant are, however, 
not possible until after the damage has arisen since previous to this there is no 
way for him to assert the claim. If there are no such blameworthy aspects to be lain 
at the victim&rsquo;s door, not even an objective failure to collect his claim, there can be 
no objective justification for robbing the victim of his claims merely because of 
the passing of time and for relieving the injuring party of liability.
</p>
<p>The starting point for the resolution of the problem must be the considera-
tion that awarding a compensation claim hinges on it being more reasonable for

</p>
<p>the injuring party to ultimately bear the burden of the damage when the grounds 
for imputation are fulfilled; ie the victim appears more worthy of protection than 
the injuring party. There is, however, no reason why the victim should seem less 
worthy of protection and have his claim refused, when for instance due to slow-
working chemical substances or radiation, the damage only occurs more than 30 
years after the action attributable to the injuring party. Why should such victims 
remain without any compensation for their loss of earnings, the medical expenses 
and their pain ? With all due respect for the interests of the injuring party in being 
entitled to consider past events over at some point, the underlying value judge-
ment established by the legal system must be kept in mind too, which holds that, 
when all grounds for imputation are fulfilled, the victim is recognised as the more 
worthy of protection than the injuring party. The exclusive consideration of the 
interests of the responsible injuring party in the prescription issue is extremely 
one-sided; it reverses the value established for the law of damages in this respect 
and thus, does not appear very reasonable. The party who may have been exposed 
to the effects of an event that would trigger another&rsquo;s liability cannot, after all, de-
mand that the damage not be allowed to ensue anymore after a certain time has 
passed, since ultimately he must be allowed at some point not to have to antici-
pate damage any longer. Nature does not allow itself to be dictated to as regards 
times within which damage must have manifested. Why, however, should the re-
sponsible injuring party&rsquo;s ability to plan ahead be favoured with the certainty of 
not being exposed to any burden in such respect although the victim cannot ob-
tain any such security that there will be no harm ? Why, in particular, should this 
be the case given that usually the injuring party is ultimately more likely to know 
of his own wrongful and culpable conduct or other event for which he is respon-
sible, making the eventual occurrence of damage much more likely to be fore-
seeable to him than to the later victim ? Accordingly, the injuring party actually 
deserves much less protection of his expectations than the victim. Above all, how-
ever: why should the security interest of the injuring party who acted in a wrongful 
and culpable manner or who is strictly liable have priority over the security inter-
est of the victim, although it is the injuring party in particular who is responsible 
for bringing about the unhappy situation ? This fundamental aspect was acknowl-
edged, at least by the German legislator, in 2013, albeit to a very limited extent. 
The new version of &sect; 197 para 1 no 1 of the German Civil Code ( BGB ) in connec-
tion with &sect; 200 BGB provides that compensation claims that are based on inten-
tional injury to life, body, health, liberty or sexual self-determination are only pre-
scribed 30 years after the claim has arisen and thus, only after the damage has 
occurred. Unfortunately, this still has no regard to the fact that in the case of gross 
or slight negligence on the part of the injuring party, there is still no apparent rea-
son why his interests should be preferred over the interests of the innocent victim. </p>

<p>835Part 9&emsp; &emsp; Prescription&emsp;of&emsp;compensation&emsp;claims
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>The various arguments that seek to point out the need to protect the liable 
injuring party cannot really counter the illogicality of  reversing  the  fundamental 
value established under the  law of damages. While it is true that the evidentiary 
situation worsens for the injuring party over the passing of a long period of time, 
it must not be forgotten that this problem is primarily imputable to the injuring 
party himself, as he carried out the actions giving rise to liability and thus, is ac-
countable for the damage. Moreover, it must be considered that the victim often 
also has evidentiary difficulties after a longer period of time, as the sequence of 
the damaging event is often hardly provable by then. In any case the argument 
regarding evidentiary difficulties does not allow any greater worthiness for pro-
tection on the part of the injuring party to be deduced than on the part of victim. 
Besides this, it must be noted that especially when it comes to conduct that slowly 
causes damage, scientific progress can certainly make it easier for the injuring 
party to defend himself702.
</p>
<p>Especially in the case of very long latent times, it can hardly be argued that 
the passing of time entitles the injuring party to  assume  that an event may be 
regarded as over and done with. It must be taken into account that after all &ndash; as 
mentioned above &ndash; it is the injuring party, who in a manner imputable to himself 
brought about a cause of damage likely to remain latent for a long period of time, 
who can far more reasonably be expected to reckon with the occurrence of damage 
and thus, with the burden of compensation claims than it is for the victim, who 
possibly knows nothing about such event or at least has no idea that he has been 
harmfully affected by such event. Hence, the value judgement is quite clearly that 
it is by far the victim who must be safeguarded against ultimately having to bear 
completely unanticipated damage rather than the culpable injuring party, who af-
ter all knows of the damaging event.
</p>
<p>It is certainly true that it is in the public interest to decide legal disputes with-
out delay. It is, however, the injuring party who, in a manner imputable to himself, 
has brought about a situation where this is no longer possible when it comes to 
damage that remains latent for a long period of time. Accordingly, it is not clear 
why this argument should be brought at the expense of the victim, who perhaps 
still has no idea of his future damage. The injuring party who wishes to have se-
curity could also bring this about by declaring his liability for the damage arising 
from the damaging event imputable to him. The future victim, who has no idea of 
either the damaging event or his own damage, has no means to prevent his future 
surprise when the damage manifests.
</p>
<p>Zimmermann / Kleinschmidt703, however, present a highly interesting argument 
beyond all this for why prescription before the occurrence of the damage and thus,

</p>
<p>prior to the compensation claim arising, does not unreasonably burden the vic-
tim at least in the case of personal injury in some legal systems: they rightly point 
out that cases of damage that remains latent for a long period of time have been 
much less noteworthy in countries where there is a generous  social security  law, 
for example in many European countries. It is of course completely true that such 
alternative compensation systems make it easier to bear the loss of a compensa-
tion claim due to prescription; the loss of the claim in this respect ultimately does 
not affect the victim but only the social security institution which may have had 
recourse claims. Nonetheless, it must be pointed out that while social security 
law does assuage the burden somewhat for the victim, it can by no means fully 
balance out the loss of the compensation claim due to prescription since social 
security does not fully cover a whole series of types of damage, in particular non-
pecuniary harm and damage to things. As regards the remaining damage not cov-
ered by social security, however, all arguments in favour of protecting the victim 
and against protecting the injuring party instead remain valid. Therefore, this ar-
gument would only be fully persuasive if social security completely sidelined the 
law of damages. This will not be the case in the foreseeable future as regards dam-
age to things and, moreover, even then the question of why the general public and 
not the responsible injuring party should ultimately have to bear the damage due 
to prescription of the social security institution&rsquo;s rights of recourse would arise. 
From that point of view, the problem of prescription would remain completely 
unsolved.
</p>
<p>It is far easier to justify approaches, examples being the French and Italian 
ones, that completely refrain from any long, objective period and always attach to 
knowledge of both the injuring party&rsquo;s identity and damage704.
</p>
<p>The connection between the length of the prescription period and the com-
mencement of the prescription period remains to be addressed. The German Civil 
Code has provided for the length of the period to be  differentiated according  to 
the  rank of  the  injured  interest;  this seems very persuasive705 as it takes into con-
sideration an essential basic value established by the legal system. Thus, it is no 
wonder that this notion has also attained considerable significance in English 
law: the proposal of the English Law Commission in 2001 provides that asserting 
personal injury claims should not be subject to any special, long prescription pe-

<p>837Part 9&emsp; &emsp; Prescription&emsp;of&emsp;compensation&emsp;claims
</p>
<p>Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective   &para;
</p>
<p>riod but only the usual, short prescription period which hinges on knowledge706. 
In the Netherlands, there is a corresponding development707. In the Austrian re-
form debate, this idea has therefore also been included: pure economic losses are 
removed from the thirty year prescription period in &sect; 1489 para 1 of the Austrian 
Draft; a period of ten years will apply in this respect.
</p>
<p>The German rule that provides for a ten-year period that only begins with the 
occurrence of the damage alongside the thirty-year period that runs from the time 
of the damaging event highlights how the length of the period is connected with 
the point of time material for the beginning. If the commencement of the period is 
tied to the occurrence of damage, there is at the least always an abstract possibil-
ity for the victim to assert his claim. If, on the other hand, the damaging event is 
the trigger for the period to begin, there is a risk that the claim will be prescribed 
before it even arises, thus depriving the victim even of the abstract possibility of 
asserting a compensation claim. In order to keep this risk to as tolerable a level as 
possible, very long prescription periods are provided: the interests of the victim 
are of course all the more massively impaired the shorter the period is, as then his 
chance &ndash; even abstract &ndash; of asserting his compensation claims applies in respect 
of an ever-decreasing amount of the damage.
</p>
<p>Vice versa, the less significant the risks of unjustified claims for compensa-
tion against the defendant arising due to the passing of time, the longer the pre-
scription period can be set. This risk can, in particular, be reduced by a complete 
reversal of the burden of proof in favour of the injuring party, as provided for in 
&sect; 933 a para 3 of the Austrian Civil Code ( ABGB ) for compensation claims based on 
the defective nature of a thing and consequential damage in this respect as well as 
in general the Austrian Draft in &sect; 1489 para 2.
</p>
<p>These considerations allow the deduction of the following  approaches  to 
regulating  the issue: that a relatively  short  prescription  period  that starts with 
the time of the  knowledge  or constructive knowledge ( obviousness ) of dam-
age and the identity of the liable party is largely undisputed and should be re-
tained as appropriate. If the damage has already occurred and if the victim 
knows of both the damage and the injuring party&rsquo;s identity, ie the main pre-
requisites for a claim, the heavy accusation of having  failed  to  act  in  good  time 
( S&auml;umigkeit ) can at least objectively be levelled against him. The heavier the ac-
cusation of having failed to act in good time weighs, the less worthy of protec-
tion the victim appears and the more appropriate it is to take account of the in-
terests of the injuring party, so that a short prescription period is appropriate.

<p>838 Helmut&emsp;Koziol&emsp; &emsp; Comparative conclusions
</p>
<p>   Helmut Koziol ( ed ) &bull; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective&para;
</p>
<p>The objective,  long prescription period should likewise also be structured ac-
cording to the values expressed by the European legal systems. Pursuant to the 
general basic principles of prescription law, it may therefore &ndash; in contrast to wide-
spread opinion &ndash; not commence prior to the occurrence of the damage: if the claim 
has not yet arisen, the accusation of having failed to act cannot be levelled even 
abstractly at the victim. Therefore, there is no justification whatsoever for imposing 
the sanction of loss of the claim upon the victim and thus benefitting the injuring 
party, who brought about the damage in a manner imputable to himself, by free-
ing him from the obligation. The balancing of interests seems to come out heavily 
against the responsible injuring party in this respect.
</p>
<p>If the prescription period does not commence before the occurrence of the 
damage, an objective period shorter than 30 years would seem appropriate. In 
terms of the underlying values, however, a lot can be said for taking how worthy 
of protection the damaged legal goods are as a premise. When the highest ranking 
goods are injured, the long objective period of 30 years ought to be maintained or 
as an alternative &ndash; even on its own &ndash; a relatively short, subjective period stipulated; 
only in the case of impairment of minor interests, above all pure economic inter-
ests, should a shorter objective period of 10 years be provided.
</p>
<p>Finally, the interests of the potentially liable party not to run into insoluble 
evidentiary difficulties due to the passing of time or not to be exposed to unjusti-
fied actions could be safeguarded by reversing the burden of proof at the expense 
of the claimant once half of the prescription period has expired. This simultane-
ously establishes an incentive for the prompt assertion of claims, as would be de-
sirable in general.

<p>Publisher&rsquo;s note
</p>
<p>This document is the complete, unaltered version of Helmut Koziol&rsquo;s  &raquo; Basic Ques-
tions of Tort Law from a Germanic Perspective &laquo;. This is not an e-book! It is a PDF. 
While the software available for the creation of e-books may satisfy the needs of a 
novel, unfortunately it does not cater to the typographical needs of lengthy scien-
tific texts with numerous heading levels, extensive footnotes and complex indexes 
based on marginal numbers. To date no solution has been found for an accept-
able interplay between authors and publishers, appropriate for titles apart from 
bestseller-lists and their available resources.
</p>
<p>Therefore we decided to use our print-layout for the electronic version. Although 
still readable on a smartphone with a 4.3-inch display, for immersive reading a 
display with a larger diagonal is recommended. Extensive reading on a 9.7-inch 
display proved comfortable and even after several pages, no signs of fatigue were 
recognised.
</p>
<p>Although the PDFs created on this basis are zoomable and enriched with naviga-
tional elements, they remain relatively rigid. However, the entries in the contents 
overview can be used to navigate to the appropriate pages. A click on the  paragraph 
symbol, found in the footer on every page, takes you back to the contents overview.
</p>
<p>Depending on the soft- and/or hardware used for reading, slight differences in the 
appearance and handling of the navigation elements will occur.
</p>
<p>PCs with Adobe Acrobat X/Reader X:
All navigational elements are black. Hovering the mouse over such an element 
turns the cursor into a small hand. A left mouse-click activates the navigation ele-
ment.
</p>
<p>iPad with Adobe Acrobat X/Reader X:
All navigational elements are blue. Clicking on them with a mouse activates them.
</p>
<p>iBook Reader on an iPad:
All navigational elements are black. A short click on elements in the footer of the 
page takes you to the next page. A long click on said elements takes you to the 
table of contents. Navigation elements in the table of contents are activated with 
a short click.
</p>
<p>Other readers, such as Kindle or Andriod-based smartphones, may behave differ-
ently.

<p>The starting point for this project on the &raquo; Basic Questions of Tort Law &laquo; was the 
book written by Helmut Koziol, the &raquo; Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Germanic 
Perspective &laquo; ( Sramek Verlag, 2012 ), a volume which presented an introduction 
into the law of torts from a Germanic perspective. Colleagues from seven coun-
tries ( O Mor&eacute;teau, France; B Askeland, Norway; K Ludwichowska-Redo, Poland; 
A Menyh&aacute;rd, Hungary; K Oliphant, England and the Commonwealth; M D Green / 
W J Cardi, USA; K Yamamoto, Japan ) were then invited to give critical responses 
to the ideas presented in the 2012 volume. The comparative law conclusions then 
attempt to pick up on the ideas expressed in the legal systems examined and to 
make them amenable for debate on the further development of the legal systems 
and their harmonisation. Obviously, it was not possible to respond to all of the  
valuable thoughts contained in the country reports. Above all, the focus was on 
ideas that have not yet been discussed very often and also on providing impulses 
in relation to legal policies. It was fascinating that often the national responses to 
law of damages issues at first gave the impression of being less than appropriate 
but then in relation to basic ideas within the respective legal systems and in inter-
play with other legal institutions, for example social security law, they turned out 
to have good arguments in their favour. Moreover, there were sometimes addi-
tional features in yet other legal systems that supplied ideas for how to further 
develop a not-yet persuasive solution and which ultimately led to surprising, new 
basic concepts, which could deliver valuable ideas for the development and har-
monisation of the European law of damages. Thus, it was possible to develop in 
the area of personal injuries a proposal for a new kind of interplay between the 
law of damages, liability insurance and social security, which could offer many 
benefits.
