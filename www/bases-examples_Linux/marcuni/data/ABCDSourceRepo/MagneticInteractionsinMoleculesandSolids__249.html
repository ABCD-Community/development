<p>Modern Chemistry is unthinkable without the achievements of Theoretical and Computational
</p>
<p>Chemistry. As a matter of fact, these disciplines are now a mandatory tool for the molecular
</p>
<p>sciences and they will undoubtedly mark the new era that lies ahead of us. To this end, in 2005,
</p>
<p>experts from several European universities joined forces under the coordination of the Universidad
</p>
<p>Aut&oacute;noma de Madrid, to launch the European Masters Course on Theoretical Chemistry and
</p>
<p>Computational Modeling (TCCM). The aim of this course is to develop scientists who are able to
</p>
<p>address a wide range of problems in modern chemical, physical, and biological sciences via a
</p>
<p>combination of theoretical and computational tools. The book series, Theoretical Chemistry and
</p>
<p>Computational Modeling, has been designed by the editorial board to further facilitate the training
</p>
<p>and formation of new generations of computational and theoretical chemists.

<p>Preface
</p>
<p>Magnetic interactions are not only fascinating from an academic viewpoint, they
</p>
<p>also play an increasingly important role in chemistry, especially in the chemistry
</p>
<p>that is aimed at designing materials with predefined properties. Many of these
</p>
<p>materials are magnetic, either in their ground states or by external perturbation and
</p>
<p>have found their way into real-world applications as molecular switches, sensors or
</p>
<p>memories. Although magnetic interactions are commonly orders of magnitude
</p>
<p>weaker than other interactions like covalent bonding, due to these interactions small
</p>
<p>changes in composition or external conditions may have huge consequences for the
</p>
<p>properties. Think for example of perovskite-type manganese oxides, where chem-
</p>
<p>ical doping affects the interplay between magnetic and electric properties, leading to
</p>
<p>giant or collossal magnetic resistance. An obvious example dealing with molecular
</p>
<p>(non-bulk) moieties can be found in the design of single-molecule magnets.
</p>
<p>Obtaining systems with tailor-made properties heavily depends on our knowledge
</p>
<p>of the interactions between local magnetic sites.
</p>
<p>This textbook aims to explain the theoretical basis of magnetic interactions at a
</p>
<p>level that will be useful for master&rsquo;s students in chemistry. Although it has been
</p>
<p>written as a volume in the series &ldquo;Theoretical and Computational Chemistry&rdquo;, the
</p>
<p>book is intended to be also helpful for students of physical, inorganic and organic
</p>
<p>chemistry. Most chemistry textbooks give only a brief general introduction, whereas
</p>
<p>textbooks treating magnetic interactions at a more advanced level are mostly written
</p>
<p>from the perspective of solid-state physics, aiming at physics students.
</p>
<p>This volume gives a treatment of magnetic interactions in terms of the phe-
</p>
<p>nomenological spin Hamiltonians that have been such powerful tools in chemistry
</p>
<p>and physics in the past half century. On the other hand, it also explains the magnetic
</p>
<p>properties using many-electron quantum mechanical models, first at a simple level
</p>
<p>and then working towards more and more advanced and accurate treatments.
</p>
<p>Connecting the two perspectives is an essential aspect of the book. It makes clear
</p>
<p>that in many cases one can derive magnetic coupling parameters not only from
</p>
<p>experiment, but also, independently, from accurate ab initio calculations.
</p>
<p>Combining the two approaches leads, in addition, to a deeper understanding of the
</p>
<p>vii</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>relation between physical phenomena and basic properties and how we can influ-
</p>
<p>ence these. Think for example of magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit coupling.
</p>
<p>Throughout the book the text is interlarded with exercises, stimulating the stu-
</p>
<p>dents to not only read but also verify the assertions and perform (parts of) deri-
</p>
<p>vations by themselves. In addition, each chapter ends with a number of problems
</p>
<p>that can be used to check whether the material has been understood.
</p>
<p>The first chapter of this volume introduces a number of basic concepts and tools
</p>
<p>necessary for the development of the theories and methods treated in the following
</p>
<p>chapters. It explains various ways to generate many-electron spin-adapted func-
</p>
<p>tions, gives an introduction to perturbation theories and to effective Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>theory. Chapter 2 treats atoms with and without an external magnetic field. This is
</p>
<p>followed by a chapter on systems containing more than one magnetic center. In this
</p>
<p>chapter the phenomenological Hamiltonians are introduced, beginning with the
</p>
<p>Heisenberg and the Ising Hamiltonian and ending with Hamiltonians that include
</p>
<p>biquadratic, cyclic or anisotropic exchange. Chapter 4 explains how quantum
</p>
<p>chemical methods, reaching from simple mean field methods to accurate models,
</p>
<p>can help to understand the magnetic properties. The simple models can give a
</p>
<p>qualitative understanding of the phenomena. The more accurate models, such as
</p>
<p>post Hartree-Fock models like DDCI, CASPT2 and NEVPT2 or broken symmetry
</p>
<p>models based on density functional theory, are able to produce accurate predictions
</p>
<p>of the energies and wave functions of the relevant states. Making accurate com-
</p>
<p>putations is one thing, mapping the results back onto the intuitive models yielding
</p>
<p>parameters that can be compared with the ones deduced from experiments is
</p>
<p>another. Effective Hamiltonian theory is a powerful tool to make these connections,
</p>
<p>as shown in Chap. 5. The last chapter explains how the magnetic interactions in
</p>
<p>solid-state compounds can be treated, with embedded cluster models and with
</p>
<p>periodic approaches. It gives an account of the double exchange mechanism in
</p>
<p>mixed valence systems, explaining the Goodenough-Kanamori rules. Finally, an
</p>
<p>account is given of spin wave theory for (anti-)ferromagnets.
</p>
<p>The book covers a full Master&rsquo;s course, but a shorter course can be distilled from
</p>
<p>it in many ways. One of them includes Chap. 2, the first two sections of Chap. 3 and
</p>
<p>optionally one of the subsections of 3.4 to get acquainted with the spin Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>formalism. After that, Sects. 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 combined with Sects. 4.3.1, 4.3.2 and
</p>
<p>4.3.4 can be studied to connect the quantitative and qualitative computational
</p>
<p>viewpoints of magnetic interactions. From Chap. 5, we recommend to include
</p>
<p>Sects. 5.1.1 and 5.3, which provide us with the basic tools for analysis. If time
</p>
<p>permits, one can close the short course with a brief account on some issues related
</p>
<p>to the solid state: Sects. 6.3 and 6.5 provide some basic notions on this topic.
</p>
<p>We end by noting that the outstanding book by the late Prof. Olivier Kahn,
</p>
<p>O. Kahn, Molecular Magnetism, VCH Publishers, 1993, has been an inspiration for
</p>
<p>the entire book.

<p>This book can be considered to a large extent as a product of sharing knowledge in
</p>
<p>the so-called Jujols community over the past 25 years. Without the continual
</p>
<p>interactions during conferences, visits and intense collaborations on many aspects
</p>
<p>of the theoretical description of magnetic phenomena in molecules and solids, this
</p>
<p>book would never have reached the degree of completeness and clarity that we hope
</p>
<p>to have reached. Special thanks are due to Jean-Paul Malrieu, Nathalie Guih&eacute;ry,

</p>
<p>Kahn, for sharing his broad and deep knowledge with us, in person, but also

<p>give a solid foundation for the other chapters. We do not pretend to review all the
</p>
<p>basics of quantum mechanics but rather focus on some specific topics that are central
</p>
<p>in the theoretical description of magnetic phenomena in molecules and extended
</p>
<p>systems. First, we will shortly review the Slater&ndash;Condon rules for the matrix elements
</p>
<p>between Slater determinants, then we will extensively discuss the generation of spin
</p>
<p>functions. Perturbation theory and effective Hamiltonians are fundamental tools for
</p>
<p>understanding and to capture the complex physics of open shell systems in simpler
</p>
<p>concepts. Therefore, the last three sections of this introductory chapter are dedicated
</p>
<p>to standard Rayleigh&ndash;Schr&ouml;dinger perturbation theory, quasi-degenerate perturbation
</p>
<p>theory and the construction of effective Hamiltonians.
</p>
<p>1.1 Slater Determinants and Slater&ndash;Condon Rules
</p>
<p>The Slater determinant is the central entity in molecular orbital theory. The exact
</p>
<p>N -electron wave function of a stationary molecule in the Born-Oppenheimer approx-
</p>
<p>imation is a 4N -dimensional object that depends on the three spatial coordinates and
</p>
<p>a spin coordinate of the N electrons in the system. This object is of course too
</p>
<p>complicated for any practical application and is, in first approximation, replaced
</p>
<p>by a product of N orthonormal 4-dimensional functions that each depend on the
</p>
<p>coordinates of only one of the electrons in the system.

</p>
<p>These one-electron functions are commonly referred to as spin orbitals and the prod-
</p>
<p>uct is known as the Hartree productΠ . Obviously, the product suffers from important
</p>
<p>deficiencies with respect to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics. The wave func-
</p>
<p>tion is not antisymmetric with respect to the permutation of any two electrons, and

<p>this requirement is automatically fulfilled. Shorthand notations for this Slater deter-

<p>Ψ (1, 2, . . . N ) = |φa(1)φb(2) . . . φω(N )| = |φaφb . . . φω| (1.3)
</p>
<p>where only the diagonal elements of the determinant are shown, the four coordinates
</p>
<p>are compacted in one index, and the normalization factor is implicit. The one-electron
</p>
<p>functions are ordered by columns (from left to right) and the electrons by rows (from
</p>
<p>top to bottom). An alternative, more explicit way of writing the wave function is
</p>
<p>obtained by defining an operator that antisymmetrizes the Hartree product Π
</p>
<p>Ψ = ÂΠ = Â[φa(1)φb(2) . . . φω(N )] (1.4)

<p>where P̂i j permutes the electron labels i and j in the Hartree product, P̂i jk replaces

<p>the electron labels ijk by jki and kij.
</p>
<p>1.1 Write out explicitly the wave function Ψ (1, 2, 3) = |φa(1)φb(2)φc(3)|
and show that Ψ (2, 1, 3) = &minus;Ψ (1, 2, 3). What happens to the wave function
when two electrons are described by the same one-electron function?
</p>
<p>A serious deficiency is that neither a Hartree product nor a Slater determinant can
</p>
<p>be an eigenfunction of the N -electron Hamilton operator. Therefore Ψ cannot be a
</p>
<p>solution of the time-independent electronic Schr&ouml;dinger equation. The reason is that
</p>
<p>the N -electron Hamiltonian cannot be written as a sum of N one-electron Hamiltoni-
</p>
<p>ans, due to the repulsive Coulomb interactions between the electrons. Nevertheless,
</p>
<p>in practice it turns out that we can work rather well with an approximate wave func-
</p>
<p>tion consisting of only one Slater determinant if we choose that particular Slater
</p>
<p>determinant Ψ that yields the lowest energy expectation value 〈Ψ |Ĥ |Ψ 〉. In other
words, we must vary the spin orbitals in Ψ until we have reached the lowest value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.1 Slater Determinants and Slater&ndash;Condon Rules 3
</p>
<p>of 〈Ψ |Ĥ |Ψ 〉. The variation theorem tells us that this lowest value is still above the
exact ground state energy E .
</p>
<p>This variational procedure leads to a set of equations
</p>
<p>f̂ φi = εiφi (1.6)
</p>
<p>called the Hartree&ndash;Fock equations, which determine the spin orbitals inΨ . The set of
</p>
<p>equations (1.6) can be seen as effective one-electron Schr&ouml;dinger equations, whose
</p>
<p>eigenvalues ε are called one-electron energies or orbital energies. There is an operator
</p>
<p>f̂ , called Fock operator, for each electron in the molecule, and they are all identical.
</p>
<p>Much can be said about the Hartree&ndash;Fock equations, their eigenvalues ε and their
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions, the spin orbitals φ but here we restrict ourselves to a few aspects
</p>
<p>that are relevant later in this chapter. Firstly, f̂ depends on the spin orbitals to be
</p>
<p>found, which has the consequence that the equations have to be solved iteratively
</p>
<p>and secondly, the energy expectation value E is not equal to the sum of the one
</p>
<p>electron energies. Summing the N individual Fock operators for the electrons of
</p>
<p>the molecule gives an N -electron Hamiltonian, Ĥ (0), that is not equal to the true
</p>
<p>N -electron Hamiltonian, but that we will use later as zeroth order Hamiltonian in a
</p>
<p>perturbation expansion. All Slater determinants Φk , k = 1, 2, . . . that can be built
from the spin orbitals of Eq. 1.6 are eigenfunctions of Ĥ (0), with eigenvalues E
</p>
<p>(0)
k
</p>
<p>equal to the sum of the orbital energies of the spin orbitals used in Ψk .
</p>
<p>The calculation of the energy of a Slater determinant and the interaction between
</p>
<p>two different Slater determinants may seem a rather complicated task given the large
</p>
<p>number of terms (N !) when the determinant is written in its explicit form. However,
the Slater&ndash;Condon rules given in Table 1.1 establish a few simple relations to calculate
</p>
<p>matrix elements between two Slater determinants.

<p>4 1 Basic Concepts
</p>
<p>To derive these rules it is convenient to introduce two formal properties of the
</p>
<p>antisymmetrizer Â
</p>
<p>Â Â =
&radic;
</p>
<p>N ! Â ÂĤ = Ĥ Â (1.7)
</p>
<p>where Ĥ is the many-electron Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>1.2 Write down the anti-symmetrization operator Â for a two-particle wave
</p>
<p>function. Show that Â Â applied on the Hartree product ϕ1ϕ2 gives the same
</p>
<p>result as applying
&radic;
</p>
<p>N ! Â.
</p>
<p>Then the energy of the determinant ΦK can be written as
</p>
<p>E = 〈ΦK |Ĥ |ΦK 〉 = 〈 ÂΠ |Ĥ | ÂΠ〉 =
&radic;
</p>
<p>N !〈Π |Ĥ | ÂΠ〉 =
N&minus;1&sum;
</p>
<p>γ=0
(&minus;1)γ 〈Π |Ĥ |P̂γΠ〉
</p>
<p>(1.8)
</p>
<p>and instead of working with determinants, the energy can be calculated from the
</p>
<p>Hartree products. In the first place, we take a closer look on the one-electron part of
</p>
<p>the Hamiltonian. For γ = 0 and ĥ(1) we obtain
</p>
<p>〈φa(1)φb(2) . . . φω(N )|ĥ(1)|φa(1)φb(2) . . . φω(N )〉
= 〈φa(1)|ĥ(1)|φa(1)〉〈φb(2) . . . φω(N )|φb(2) . . . φω(N )〉 = 〈φa |ĥ|φa〉 = ha
</p>
<p>(1.9)
</p>
<p>Using ĥ(2) leads to hb and all other electron coordinates give similar results. On the
</p>
<p>contrary, the evaluation of the matrix elements with γ = 1, that is one permutation
in Π , leads to zero due to the orthogonality of the orbitals. For example, the action
</p>
<p>of P̂12 gives
</p>
<p>&minus; 〈φa(1)φb(2) . . . φω(N )|ĥ(1)|φb(1)φa(2) . . . φω(N )〉
= &minus;〈φa(1)|ĥ(1)|φb(1)〉〈φb(2) . . . φω(N )|φa(2) . . . φω(N )〉 = 0 (1.10)
</p>
<p>where the minus sign arises from the (&minus;1)γ factor in the energy expression. The
two-electron part can be determined with a similar reasoning. First we focus on the
</p>
<p>γ = 0 case with the coordinates of electron 1 and 2.

</p>
<p>Similar Coulomb integrals J are obtained for other combinations of electron coor-

electrons 1 and 2:

|φbφa〉 = &minus;Kab (1.12)
</p>
<p>This integral is known as the exchange integral and usually written as Kab. Other
</p>
<p>combinations of permutations and electron coordinates lead to similar K &prime;s but higher-
order permutations will always result in zero contributions due to the orthogonality.
</p>
<p>Hence, the terms can be collected and the expression given in the top row of Table 1.1
</p>
<p>emerges.
</p>
<p>The evaluation of the interaction matrix elements between Slater determinants
</p>
<p>with different occupations follows the same mechanics and can be derived as a
</p>
<p>useful exercise by the reader.

<p>1.2 Generation of Many Electron Spin Functions
</p>
<p>In a non-relativistic setting the N -electron wave function Ψ can be chosen to be also
</p>
<p>an eigenfunction of Ŝ2 and one of its components, we denote this component Ŝz .
</p>
<p>Ŝ2ΨS,MS = S(S + 1)ΨS,MS (1.13a)
ŜzΨS,MS = MSΨS,MS (1.13b)

</p>
<p>coupling (see Sect. 2.1) can be neglected.
</p>
<p>Before looking in more detail to the N -electron wave functions, we will first shortly
</p>
<p>summarize the most important aspects of the spin part of a one-electron wave
</p>
<p>function. We will follow the common practice to use lower case symbols when
</p>
<p>dealing with one-particle wave functions and uppercase for many-particle systems.</p>

<p>6 1 Basic Concepts
</p>
<p>The one-electron spin functions to be considered have the quantum numbers s = 1
2
</p>
<p>and ms = &plusmn; 12 and can be written in different formats:
</p>
<p>|s,ms〉 = [|1/2 , 1/2 〉, |1/2 ,&minus;1/2 〉] = [α, β] = [&uarr;,&darr;] (1.14)
</p>
<p>where [. . .] denotes the set of functions. When the spatial part of the wave function
</p>
<p>is explicitly written, a similar notation can be used for spin orbitals:
</p>
<p>|s,ms〉 =
[
ϕ1, ϕ2
</p>
<p>]
(1.15)
</p>
<p>where the barred orbital carries the electron with ms = &minus;1/2 . The notations by α, β
andϕ1,ϕ2 are most frequently used and will also be followed here. The corresponding
</p>
<p>eigenvalues of the total spin operator ŝ2 and the z-component of it (ŝz) are
</p>
<p>ŝ2α = 1/2 (1/2 + 1) α = 3/4α ŝzα = 1/2α (1.16a)
ŝ2β = &minus;1/2 (&minus;1/2 + 1) β = 3/4β ŝzβ = &minus;1/2β (1.16b)
</p>
<p>The ladder operators ŝ&plusmn; = ŝx &plusmn; i ŝy change the ms quantum number of the spin
functions by the following action
</p>
<p>ŝ+|s,ms〉 =
&radic;
</p>
<p>s(s + 1)&minus; ms(ms + 1)|s,ms + 1〉 (1.17)
ŝ&minus;|s,ms〉 =
</p>
<p>&radic;
s(s + 1)&minus; ms(ms &minus; 1)|s,ms &minus; 1〉
</p>
<p>This leads to the following simple relations when applied to the one-electron spin
</p>
<p>functions α and β:
</p>
<p>ŝ+α = 0 ŝ&minus;α = β (1.18a)
ŝ+β = α ŝ&minus;β = 0 (1.18b)
</p>
<p>The substitution of ŝx = 12 (ŝ+ + ŝ&minus;) and ŝy =
1
2i
(ŝ+ &minus; ŝ&minus;) in the expression of the
</p>
<p>total spin operator ŝ2 = ŝ2x + ŝ2y + ŝ2z gives a simple working equation to evaluate
the expectation value of ŝ2 for spin functions:
</p>
<p>ŝ2 = ŝ+ŝ&minus; &minus; ŝz + ŝ2z (1.19)
</p>
<p>For completeness, we also give the results of operating with ŝx and ŝy on α and β

<p>1.4 (a) Demonstrate that the normalization factor is one for the application
</p>
<p>of ŝ+ to β and zero for α. (b) Derive the expression of the total spin operator
ŝ2 in terms of ŝ+, ŝ&minus; and ŝz . Remember that [ŝ+, ŝ&minus;] = 2ŝz . (c) Calculate the
expectation value of ŝ2 of α and β using Eq. 1.19.
</p>
<p>In the case of N -electron systems, the spin operators have to be applied on Slater
</p>
<p>determinants or linear combinations of these. The action of the N -electron operator
</p>
<p>Ŝ2 is most conveniently evaluated in the N -electron version of Eq. 1.19 with Ŝz , Ŝ
+
</p>
<p>and Ŝ&minus; defined as the sum of the corresponding one-electron operators.
</p>
<p>Ŝ2 = Ŝ+ Ŝ&minus; &minus; Ŝz + Ŝ2z (1.21)

<p>The multi-electron version of Eq. 1.17 is

<p>Ŝ+|S, MS〉 =

<p>S(S + 1)&minus; MS(MS + 1)|S, MS + 1〉
Ŝ&minus;|S, MS〉 =
</p>
<p>&radic;
S(S + 1)&minus; MS(MS &minus; 1)|S, MS &minus; 1〉 (1.23)
</p>
<p>whereas many-electron functions consisting of one Slater determinant are always
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of Ŝz with an eigenvalue given by the difference of the number of
</p>
<p>α and β electrons multiplied by one half, this is in general not the case for Ŝ2. To
</p>

<p>This shows that the Slater determinants are eigenfunctions of Ŝz and the correspond-
</p>
<p>ing eigenvalues MS are equal to 1 and 0, respectively. The result of applying Ŝ
2 is
</p>
<p>rather straightforward using Eq. 1.21 with the notion that (&minus;Ŝz+ Ŝ2z ) gives zero when
applied on the spin functions αα, αβ and βα. Only remains to determine the action

</p>
<p>Hence, the single Slater determinant |ϕ1ϕ2| is a proper spin eigenfunction, while
|ϕ1ϕ2| is not. In general, linear combinations of Slater determinants are necessary to
ensure that the wave function is an eigenfunction of Ŝ2.

<p>In the following, three strategies will be illustrated to construct spin eigenfunctions
</p>

<p>1.2.1 Many Electron Spin Functions by Projection
</p>
<p>In general the spin eigenfunction of a 2S + 1 spin multiplet is a linear combination
of N -electron Slater determinants that all have the same MS quantum number
</p>
<p>2S+1Ψ =
&sum;
</p>
<p>L
</p>
<p>cLΦL (1.28)
</p>
<p>with ŜzΦL = MSΦL for all L . If {Ψi } is a complete set of M eigenfunctions of
Ŝ2 with the same MS , i.e. Ŝ
</p>
<p>2Ψi = Si (Si + 1)Ψi and ŜzΨi = MSΨi for i = 1, M ,
then any of the determinants ΦL can be written as a linear combination of these
</p>
<p>spin eigenfunctions. In other words, any determinant ΦL can be seen as a linear
</p>
<p>combination of different spin eigenfunctions Ψi and to obtain the expression of a
</p>
<p>proper spin eigenfunction one should eliminate all the undesired terms from the
</p>
<p>sum. A natural way to proceed is to apply projection techniques. Since the spin
</p>
<p>eigenvalue of Ψi is equal to Si (Si + 1), the operator
</p>
<p>P̂eL =
[
</p>
<p>Ŝ2 &minus; SL(SL + 1)
]
</p>
<p>(1.29)
</p>
<p>eliminates the L-component from the determinant Φ. Hence the subsequent applica-
</p>
<p>tion of P̂ei , P̂
e
j , . . . P̂
</p>
<p>e
M (except P̂
</p>
<p>e
k ) preserves the k-component and leads to
</p>
<p>2Sk+1Ψk .
This procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1.1 for a trivial example of a vector with two
</p>
<p>components. After projecting the vector on the x-axis, one subtracts this projection
</p>
<p>from the total vector to obtain the y-component.
</p>
<p>The general expression of the operator to obtain spin eigenfunction Ψk from a
</p>
<p>determinant ΦL is
</p>
<p>P̂k =
M&prod;
</p>
<p>l �=k

<p>10 1 Basic Concepts
</p>
<p>These expressions produce projections that are not necessarily normalized to one, but
</p>
<p>this can easily be done at the end of the process. The procedure is most conveniently
</p>
<p>illustrated by deriving the singlet and triplet open-shell spin eigenfunctions with
</p>
<p>MS = 0 for a two-electron in two-orbitals case. In the notation of Eq. 1.15 the two
determinants are
</p>
<p>Φ1 = |ϕ1ϕ1ϕ2ϕ2 . . . ϕaϕb| = |ab|
Φ2 = |ϕ1ϕ1ϕ2ϕ2 . . . ϕaϕb| = |ab| (1.31)
</p>
<p>There are two possible spin eigenfunctions, singlet and triplet, with S equal to 0 and
</p>
<p>1, respectively. The projection operators are directly obtained from Eq. 1.30
</p>
<p>P̂0 = Ŝ2 &minus; 2 P̂1 = Ŝ2 &minus; 0 (1.32)
</p>
<p>The result of applying Ŝ2 on Φ1 is given in Eq. 1.27, and hence, the projection
</p>
<p>operators give
</p>
<p>P̂0|ab| = (Ŝ2 &minus; 2)|ab| = |ab| + |ab| &minus; 2|ab| = |ab| &minus; |ab| (1.33a)
P̂1|ab| = (Ŝ2 &minus; 0)|ab| = |ab| + |ab| (1.33b)
</p>
<p>The functions have to be multiplied by 1&radic;
2
</p>
<p>to obtain the properly normalized expres-
</p>
<p>sions.

<p>1.6 (a) Find the other two components of the triplet spin eigenfunctions by
</p>
<p>applying the ladder operators on the MS = 0 component of the triplet function.
(b) Derive the singlet and triplet spin eigenfunctions by projection using Φ2
of Eq. 1.31.
</p>
<p>1.2.2 Spin Functions by Diagonalization
</p>
<p>One way to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an operator is to diagonalize
</p>
<p>the matrix representation of the operator in a complete basis. Therefore, a natural
</p>
<p>alternative to the projection method is the process of diagonalizing the matrix rep-
</p>
<p>resentation of the Ŝ2 operator. The basis of the matrix representation is formed by
</p>
<p>the individual determinants. The resulting eigenvectors are the spin eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>(linear combinations of these basis functions, the determinants) and the correspond-
</p>
<p>ing eigenvalues indicate the spin of the eigenfunction. The method is straightforward
</p>
<p>in its application but can require a substantial amount of analytical work since all
</p>
<p>matrix elements of Ŝ2 are needed, which can become rather cumbersome for systems
</p>
<p>with an elevated number of unpaired electrons. The method is illustrated for a system</p>

<p>with three electrons in three distinct orbitals. The basis set spanned in the MS = 12
space contains three determinants
</p>
<p>Φ1 = |abc| Φ2 = |abc| Φ3 = |abc| (1.34)
</p>
<p>The matrix representation of Ŝ2 can be constructed by analyzing the effect of Ŝ+ Ŝ&minus;,
Ŝz and Ŝ
</p>
<p>2
z (cf. Eq. 1.21) on the three basis functions.
</p>
<p>Ŝ+ Ŝ&minus;|abc| = Ŝ+

|abc| (1.35b)
</p>
<p>Ŝ2z |abc| =
1
</p>
<p>4
|abc| (1.35c)
</p>
<p>The other two determinants give analogous results and from this we evaluate the
</p>
<p>action of Ŝ2 on the three basis functions:
</p>
<p>Ŝ2|abc| = 7/4 |abc| + |abc| + |abc| (1.36a)
Ŝ2|abc| = |abc| + 7/4 |abc| + |abc| (1.36b)
Ŝ2|abc| = |abc| + |abc| + 7/4 |abc| (1.36c)
</p>
<p>which leads to the following matrix representation of Ŝ2
</p>
<p>|abc〉 |abc〉 |abc〉

</p>
<p>As can be seen, the matrix has non-zero off diagonal matrix elements showing that
</p>
<p>the basis set of determinants is not a basis of eigenfunctions of the Ŝ2 operator. From
</p>
<p>here, the search for spin eigenfunctions follows standard diagonalization schemes.

c1 +c2 = &minus;c3) and no unique solution can be determined. This is expected since the
two functions have the same eigenvalues of Ŝ2 and any linear combination of the two

<p>doublet functions is also an eigenfunction. In some cases the spatial symmetry of

<p>emerges. For instance, in a system with inversion symmetry and center b located on

</p>
<p>Fig. 1.2 Model system with four unpaired electrons on three centers (top). The two electrons on
</p>
<p>center 1 are coupled to a triplet state as stated by Hund&rsquo;s rule. Singlet coupling on center 1 leads
</p>
<p>to states that are much higher in energy and not directly relevant for the magnetic interactions. The
</p>
<p>lower part shows the system with four electrons on two centers
</p>
<p>spin eigenfunctions is described in great detail by Pauncz [1, 2] and we refer to
</p>
<p>these books for further reading. Here, we will describe the main characteristics of
</p>
<p>the method and illustrate it with a system with four unpaired electrons localized on
</p>
<p>two or three magnetic centers as shown in Fig. 1.2.
</p>
<p>The starting point of the method is the one electron spin function α with S = 1
2
</p>
<p>to which a second electron spin can be added to give an S = 1 spin function
or subtracted, resulting in an S = 0 function. Subsequently more electron spins
can be added or subtracted until the desired number of spins are described in the
</p>
<p>spin eigenfunctions. The use of Clebsch&ndash;Gordon coefficients ensures that linear
</p>
<p>combinations of determinants are produced that are eigenfunctions of Ŝ2 at each stage
</p>
<p>of the procedure. An advantage of this method is that one can specifically construct
</p>
<p>a certain spin eigenfunction among all possible with the required spin couplings
</p>
<p>between the electrons. This is best illustrated in the branching diagram shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.3, which represents the different routes that can be taken to construct a spin
</p>
<p>function with a given S-value (on the y-axis) for a certain number of electrons (on
</p>
<p>the x-axis). The way up along the branching diagram represents adding an electron
</p>
<p>spin (increasing S by 1
2
</p>
<p>) and going downwards indicates that an electron spin is
</p>
<p>subtracted, that is, S is diminished from S to S &minus; 1
2
</p>
<p>. The number in the circles
</p>
<p>gives the number of different routes that can be taken to arrive at that point. For
</p>
<p>instance, there are two ways to construct a singlet spin function with four electrons,
</p>
<p>three different triplet functions and one quintet. The branching diagrams allows us to
</p>
<p>choose one specific path to reach the desired spin function. This can be very useful,
</p>
<p>for example, to impose high spin coupling between unpaired electrons on the same
</p>
<p>magnetic center to fulfill Hund&rsquo;s rule.
</p>
<p>The formulas for adding and subtracting an electron spin look somewhat awkward
</p>
<p>but are rather simple in their application. Moreover, the method is very well suited
</p>
<p>for translation into a computer program. Adding a spin is done with</p>

<p>Two-by-two additions: The process of generating spin functions by the genealogical
</p>
<p>approach can be made a little less tedious by considering the incorporation of two
</p>
<p>electrons at the same time. An additional advantage of doing so is that one better
</p>
<p>controls the spin coupling of electron pairs. The triplet functions with four electrons,
</p>
<p>Ψ (4, 1, 1) andΨ &prime;(4, 1, 1)Eqs. 1.48 and 1.49 do have triplet coupling among electron
1 and 2, but turn out to be mixtures of singlet and triplet coupling for electrons 3 and 4.
</p>
<p>Only after taking the correct linear combination, spin functions could be constructed
</p>
<p>with clear-cut spin couplings of both electron pairs. This can be achieved directly
</p>
<p>with the Serber variant of the genealogical approach [3, 4] illustrated in the branching

<p>the starting point in the Serber diagram is Ψ (2, 1, 1) = α(1)α(2) and depending

<p>1.2.4 Final Remarks
</p>
<p>The examples given in the precedent paragraphs cover many real-world cases. The
</p>
<p>two-electrons in two-orbitals case discussed in Sect. 1.2.1 is representative of all types
</p>
<p>of CuII binuclear complexes or organic biradicals. It is important to remind that the
</p>
<p>intuitive representation with an up and down spin often used to indicate the open-
</p>
<p>shell singlet state in these cases (see Fig. 1.6) is not the most rigorous representation
</p>
<p>of this quantum state and may lead to confusion. It corresponds to the |α(1)β(2)|
determinant and is actually a mixture of the MS = 0 components of singlet and
triplet functions.
</p>
<p>Similar considerations hold for the three unpaired electrons case of Sect. 1.2.2.
</p>
<p>While the three parallel electrons on the transition metal centers on the left side of
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.7 give a satisfactory representation of the high-spin situation, i.e. the quartet
</p>

</p>
<p>1.3 Perturbation Theory
</p>
<p>Many body perturbation theory is one of the fundamental tools in Quantum Chem-
</p>
<p>istry. It takes a central place both in the calculation of accurate energies and wave
</p>
<p>functions, and in the analysis of results for reaching a better understanding of the
</p>
<p>sometimes complicated physics contained in the system. There are basically two
</p>
<p>flavors of many-body perturbation theory. The first is what one calls the diagonalize-
</p>
<p>and-then-perturb method, and the second one inverts this order, it follows a perturb-
</p>
<p>and-then-diagonalize approach.
</p>
<p>When one is only interested in a single state that is well separated from all the
</p>
<p>others, for example a non-degenerate ground state, the distinction is not very rel-
</p>
<p>evant. Using a proper zeroth-order wave function such as the one provided by the
</p>
<p>Hartree&ndash;Fock approach, the effect of electron correlation can be estimated with any
</p>
<p>standard perturbation scheme, being the M&oslash;ller&ndash;Plesset implementation the most
</p>
<p>common one.
</p>
<p>However, it becomes a little more subtle when one wants to describe a collec-
</p>
<p>tion of states of a quantum system that are close in energy, or when states with a
</p>
<p>marked multiconfigurational character have to be described. The reference space is
</p>
<p>now spanned by several Slater determinants that define a collection of electronic
</p>
<p>states. Most approaches first diagonalize the reference space and then introduce
</p>
<p>the effect of the external determinants with perturbation theory. In contrast, quasi-
</p>
<p>degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT), first addresses the external determinants for
</p>
<p>all the matrix elements among the reference determinants and then diagonalizes the
</p>
<p>reference space to obtain the energies and wave functions of the states of interest.
</p>
<p>1.3.1 Rayleigh&ndash;Schr&ouml;dinger Perturbation Theory
</p>
<p>There are only few systems for which the Schr&ouml;dinger equation can be solved exactly.
</p>
<p>Therefore, many schemes have been developed to obtain as accurate as possible
</p>
<p>approximate solutions. The perturbative treatment is based on the partition of the
</p>
<p>full Hamiltonian of the system in two parts.
</p>

<p>1.3.2 M&oslash;ller&ndash;Plesset Perturbation Theory
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a common implementation of many-body perturbation theory
</p>
<p>in quantum chemistry is based on the zeroth-order Hamiltonian proposed by M&oslash;ller
</p>
<p>and Plesset. When the Hartree&ndash;Fock wave function ΦHF is known, the zeroth-order
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian can be defined as the sum of the Fock operators
</p>
<p>Ĥ (0) =
N&sum;
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>f̂ (i) (1.74)

<p>1.3.3 Quasi-Degenerate Perturbation Theory
</p>
<p>The second-order correction to the energy given in Eq. 1.83 diverges when the denom-
</p>
<p>inator goes to zero, that is when the zeroth-order energy of excited Slater determinants
</p>
<p>becomes close to E (0). Moreover, in such situations one is usually interested not only
</p>
<p>in the lowest state, but in a number of low-lying nearly-degenerate states. In such
</p>
<p>cases one should go beyond the single determinant description of the zeroth-order
</p>
<p>problem and extend the reference with other low-energy determinants.
</p>
<p>Let S be the collection of Slater determinants that span the Hilbert space of the
</p>
<p>full Hamiltonian of a system. The complete space is divided in a model space S0 and
</p>
<p>an external space S&prime;.
S = S0 + S&prime; (1.85)
</p>
<p>with S0 = {ΦI , ΦJ , . . .} and S&prime; = {ΦR, ΦS, . . .}. The model space contains all the
determinants that significantly contribute to the (multiconfigurational) wave func-
</p>
<p>tions of the lowest, nearly degenerate electronic states. In ordinary many-body per-
</p>
<p>turbation theory, one would first diagonalize the full Hamiltonian in the subspace
</p>
<p>S0 to construct the reference wave functions Ψ
(0) and then include the effect of the
</p>
<p>determinants of S&prime; through the expressions of the second- (or higher-) order perturba-
tion theory in a state-by-state manner as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.8. This is
</p>
<p>the diagonalize-and-then-perturb approach. On the contrary, quasi-degenerate per-
</p>
<p>turbation theory first takes into account the effect of the external determinants on the
</p>
<p>interactions among the determinants of S0 and then diagonalizes the resulting matrix
</p>
<p>to obtain the N -electron wave functions and energies of the states of interest. This
</p>
<p>modification of the matrix elements of S0 is often called dressing or screening and
</p>
<p>leads to an effective Hamiltonian that not only describes the bare coupling between
</p>
<p>the determinants of the model space, but also the effects of electron correlation. The
</p>
<p>expression for the effective Hamiltonian at the second-order of perturbation is
</p>
<p>〈ΦI |Ĥ eff |ΦJ 〉 = 〈ΦI |Ĥ |ΦJ 〉 +
&sum;

<p>Fig. 1.8 Schematic representation of the diagonalize-then-perturb approach (top) and perturb-then-
</p>
<p>diagonalize (bottom) approaches. In the upper scheme, the model space is diagonalized and then
</p>
<p>the effect of the external determinants is included state-by-state. In the lower scheme, all matrix
</p>
<p>elements of the model space are perturbed and subsequently the model space is diagonalized
</p>
<p>It is obvious from the denominator in the second term that the matrix will become
</p>
<p>non-Hermitian when the zeroth-order energies of the determinants in S0 are not the
</p>
<p>same. Therefore, this recipe only works for (nearly-)degenerate states. One advan-
</p>
<p>tage of this &lsquo;perturb-and-then-diagonalize&rsquo; approach is that the length of the wave
</p>
<p>function expansion remains of the dimension of the model space, and hence, espe-
</p>
<p>cially suitable for analysis purposes. Multideterminantal perturbation schemes that
</p>
<p>follow the &lsquo;diagonalize-and-then-perturb&rsquo; approach are described in Sect. 4.3.3.
</p>
<p>1.4 Effective Hamiltonian Theory
</p>
<p>The exact N -electron wave function can be thought of to be an infinite linear combi-
</p>
<p>nation of Slater determinants built from an infinitely large orbital set. While such a
</p>
<p>wave function is only a hypothetical object, lengthy wave function expansions can be
</p>
<p>considered to be good approximations to the exact solution. Hence, they will provide
</p>
<p>us with accurate energies and other observables of the system that can be extracted
</p>
<p>from the wave function by calculating the expectation value of the corresponding
</p>
<p>operator. However, such lengthy wave functions are often not easily understood
</p>
<p>and the extraction of simple models with predictive and interpretative power is not
</p>
<p>straightforward. Ideally, one would like to have a compact wave function with only
</p>
<p>a small number of Slater determinants, without loosing the accuracy of the nearly
</p>
<p>exact wave function.
</p>
<p>Effective Hamiltonian theory establishes a connection between accuracy and inter-
</p>
<p>pretation. It is used in many fields of chemistry and physics in different variants and
</p>
<p>sometimes confused with model Hamiltonians. In the scope of this monograph, the
</p>
<p>latter term is used for simple Hamiltonians that find their origin in physical/chemical
</p>
<p>intuition, and hence, are phenomenological in nature. These model Hamiltonians</p>

</p>
<p>have been put forward to interpret experimental measurements and capture the com-
</p>
<p>plex physics of a system in simpler concepts. The parameters of the model are usually
</p>
<p>determined by fitting the experimental data to analytical expressions derived from
</p>
<p>the model Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>In the significance used here the effective Hamiltonian maps a lengthy, highly-
</p>
<p>accurate wave function onto a much smaller subspace in such a way that the diagonal-
</p>
<p>ization of the subspace gives exactly the same eigenvalues as those of the nearly exact
</p>
<p>wave functions and the corresponding eigenvectors are projections of the original
</p>
<p>wave functions. The dimension of the subspace is typically the same as the dimen-
</p>
<p>sion of the space spanned by some widely used model Hamiltonian. In this way, a
</p>
<p>one-to-one correspondence can be established between the ab initio calculations and
</p>
<p>the model Hamiltonian. Hence, the effective Hamiltonian theory provides a rigorous
</p>
<p>procedure to extract model parameters from accurate calculations.
</p>
<p>Similar to what is done in QDPT, a model space S0 of dimension N is defined as a
</p>
<p>subspace of the full Hilbert space S of dimension M . Remember that QDPT is used
</p>
<p>to determine accurate wave functions and energies starting from a limited description
</p>
<p>of the system based on the model space. However, in the present case, the accurate
</p>
<p>energies and wave functions are already known and the action goes in the opposite
</p>
<p>direction; the lengthy wave function of length M is mapped on the smaller subspace
</p>
<p>S0 ensuring a minimum loss of the information contained in the full solution.
</p>
<p>In the first place, the eigenfunctions of S (Ψk) have to be projected onto the model
</p>
<p>space by applying the projection operator
</p>
<p>P̂S0 =
N&sum;
</p>
<p>i=1
|Φi 〉〈Φi | (1.87)
</p>
<p>where Φi is the basis of the model space. Among the projected vectors Ψ̃k = P̂S0Ψk ,
the N projections are selected that have the largest norm. These vectors are often
</p>
<p>defined as the basis of the so-called target space ST and are used to construct the
</p>
<p>effective Hamiltonian. However, the vectors Ψ̃k are in general not orthogonal. In the
</p>
<p>original formulation of Bloch [5] the projections are transformed to their biorthogonal
</p>
<p>form by
</p>
<p>Ψ̃
&dagger;
k = S
</p>
<p>&minus;1Ψ̃k (1.88)
</p>
<p>with
</p>
<p>〈Ψ̃k |Ψ̃ &dagger;l 〉 = 〈Ψ̃

</p>
<p>&dagger;
k |Ψ̃
</p>
<p>&dagger;
l 〉 = Skl (1.89)
</p>
<p>The effective Hamiltonian can now be expressed in its spectral decomposition
</p>
<p>Ĥ eff =
&sum;
</p>
<p>k&isin;ST
</p>
<p>|Ψ̃k〉Ek〈Ψ̃ &dagger;k | (1.90)
</p>
<p>However, this definition leads to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which may not be
</p>
<p>the most optimal representation for interpretation. Therefore, one often adopts the</p>

</p>
<p>Ψ̃&perp;k = S&minus;

</p>
<p>This procedure produces orthogonal vectors and all elements of the target space are

<p>is hermitian and reads

</p>
<p>The third possibility for processing the projected vectors is the Gram-Schmidt orthog-
</p>
<p>onalization, in which the projections are sequentially orthogonalized. Starting with
</p>
<p>the normalization of Ψ̃1, the second vector is orthogonalized by projecting out the
</p>
<p>component of vector 1. Then Ψ̃3 is orthogonalized on Ψ̃1 and Ψ̃2, and so on. This
</p>
<p>means that the first vectors in the process are only slightly affected by the orthogonal-
</p>
<p>ization, while the last one is completely determined by the orthogonality condition.
</p>
<p>This loss of information&mdash;the coefficients of the projection of the last vector are not
</p>
<p>used&mdash;may be advantageous when some roots, i.e. computed (approximate) wave-
</p>
<p>functions, in the target space are (nearly) degenerate with other roots in the external
</p>
<p>space. In such cases, the norm of the projection may be rather small and the informa-
</p>
<p>tion hold in the projections is not always well-founded, since strong mixing may have
</p>
<p>occurred with the states that are in the external space. The energy of these states can
</p>
<p>be considered as reliable, mixing among (nearly) degenerate states does not affect
</p>
<p>the energy.
</p>
<p>In short, an effective Hamiltonian can be constructed from the following recipe.
</p>
<p>&bull; Choose a relevant model space of dimension N and write down the Slater deter-
minants that constitute the basis of this space. It may be handy to work out all the
</p>
<p>matrix elements of the model Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>&bull; Select the N eigenfunctions of the full Hilbert space (e.g. obtained in an ab initio
calculation) with the largest projection onto the model space. (Bi-)orthonormalize
</p>
<p>the projections of these vectors and take the total energy of one of the roots as zero
</p>
<p>of energy.
</p>
<p>&bull; Calculate the matrix elements 〈ΦI | Ĥ eff |ΦJ 〉 of the effective Hamiltonian using
the definition given in Eq. 1.90 or Eq. 1.92. One can check the procedure by diag-
</p>
<p>onalizing the resulting matrix. This should give the same energies as found in the
</p>
<p>ab initio calculation and the corresponding eigenvectors have to be identical to the
</p>
<p>projections of these roots.
</p>
<p>When the effective Hamiltonian is constructed from ab initio wave functions the
</p>
<p>resulting matrix is numerical in nature. This matrix can be used to determine the val-
</p>
<p>ues of the parameters of a phenomenological model Hamiltonian, but also to check
</p>
<p>the validity of the model. In most cases the structure of the effective Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>matrix coincides with the structure of the model Hamiltonian, but when significant
</p>
<p>deviations are observed, it should not be discarded that important interactions are
</p>
<p>missing in the model. For instance, when non-zero matrix elements appear in the</p>

<p>effective Hamiltonian at places where the model Hamiltonian is zero, one should
</p>
<p>revise the expression of the model Hamiltonian. This brings us to the second type
</p>
<p>of effective Hamiltonians that falls under the scope of this monograph; the ana-
</p>
<p>lytical effective Hamiltonian. The above sketched procedure to derive a numerical
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian can also be used to map the analytical expressions of a precise, but com-
</p>
<p>plicated model Hamiltonian onto a simpler one. In this way one can rigorously derive
</p>
<p>new model Hamiltonians, for example when the comparison between a numerical
</p>
<p>effective Hamiltonian and a simple model Hamiltonian fails.
</p>
<p>Problems
</p>
<p>1.1 Ordering by spatial or spin part. In the notation of multideterminantal wave
</p>
<p>functions, one can either respect as much as possible the order of the spatial part in
</p>
<p>the different determinants, or strictly maintain the order of the spin part. Construct
</p>
<p>singlet and triplet functions for a two-electrons in two-orbitals case respecting (i) the
</p>
<p>order of the spatial part and (ii) the order of the spin part of the total wave function.

<p>One Magnetic Center
</p>
<p>Abstract This chapter discusses some of the magnetic phenomena that can be
</p>
<p>observed in systems with a single paramagnetic center. After shortly reviewing the
</p>
<p>basics of the magnetic moments of a free atom, we analyze the effect of spin-orbit
</p>
<p>coupling and an external magnetic field on the MS levels of the ground state of larger
</p>
<p>systems. In a step-by-step procedure, we will first derive the model Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>to describe the magnetic anisotropy without external field, the so-called zero-field
</p>
<p>splitting. Secondly, the role of the external field is explored and a relation is estab-
</p>
<p>lished with the magnetic susceptibility, a macroscopic quantity. The chapter is closed
</p>
<p>by discussing the model Hamiltonian that combines the zero-field splitting and the
</p>
<p>anisotropy of the g-tensor to complete the description of the splitting of the MS levels
</p>
<p>in systems with one, anisotropic, magnetic center.
</p>
<p>2.1 Atomic Magnetic Moments
</p>
<p>The two main sources for the magnetic moment of a free atom or molecule are the
</p>
<p>electronic spin moment and the angular moment. The motion of electrons relative
</p>
<p>to the nucleus in atoms with filled shells and in closed shell molecules leads to zero
</p>
<p>spin moment and zero angular moment. Therefore, such atoms and molecules can
</p>
<p>only have an induced magnetic moment when placed in an external magnetic field.
</p>
<p>The simplest system with an intrinsic non-zero magnetic moment is an isolated
</p>
<p>one-electron atom or ion, treating both particles as point charges and neglecting the
</p>
<p>possible nuclear spin. The motion of the electron around the charged nucleus induces
</p>
<p>a microscopic current that produces a microscopic magnetic field. This leads to a
</p>
<p>so-called orbital magnetic moment which is proportional to the angular moment of
</p>
<p>the electron. Taking z as our quantization axis, its z-component equals
</p>
<p>mz = &minus;μBml (2.1)
</p>
<p>where ml is the magnetic quantum number of the electron: ml = &minus;l,&minus;l+1 . . . l&minus;1, l.
The quantity μB = eh/4πme (1/2 in atomic units) is the elementary unit of magnetic
moment, called the Bohr magneton. Its value is 9.27 &times; 10&minus;24 JT&minus;1.

</p>
<p>There is another contribution to the total magnetic moment of the electron in a
</p>
<p>hydrogenic atom, this is due to the electron spin. From a classical viewpoint, this
</p>
<p>contribution (the spin magnetic moment) is due to the rotation of the charged electron
</p>
<p>around its axis. Its magnitude is given by
</p>
<p>msz = &minus;geμBms (2.2)
</p>
<p>with ms = 12 ,&minus;

2
</p>
<p>. The factor ge turns out to be equal to 2.002319314. This value
</p>
<p>is slightly different from the value of 2 that might at first sight be expected from
</p>
<p>the analogy with the orbital magnetic moment, showing that this classical approach
</p>
<p>may be misleading. The difference with the value of 2 can be accounted for by
</p>
<p>the theory of quantum electron dynamics. The spin-orbit interaction is a relativistic
</p>
<p>effect, which appears in a natural way if we use Dirac&rsquo;s instead of Schr&ouml;dinger&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>equation of motion. We can also describe it in an approximate sense by adding to
</p>
<p>the non-relativistic one-electron Hamiltonian a term that is proportional to the inner
</p>
<p>product of the vector operators l̂ and ŝ
</p>
<p>Ĥso = ξ(r)l̂ &middot; ŝ (2.3)
</p>
<p>The average of ξ(r) over r is written hcζ and ζ is called the spin-orbit constant. The
</p>
<p>spin-orbit constant of a hydrogenic atom turns out to be strongly dependent on Z and
</p>
<p>on the quantum numbers n and l of the electronic wave function

<p>)

</p>
<p>(2.4)
</p>
<p>where α is the fine-structure constant (&sim;1/137) and R is the Rydberg constant. The
non-relativistic one-electron Hamiltonian commutes with l̂2, ŝ2 and (taking z as the
</p>
<p>quantization axes) with l̂z and ŝz. Clearly, when we add Ĥso to the Hamiltonian, the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian no longer commutes with these four operators and l, s, ml and ms are no
</p>
<p>longer &ldquo;good&rdquo; quantum numbers. The only remaining quantum numbers are j (with
</p>
<p>values l + 1
2
</p>
<p>and l &minus; 1
2
</p>
<p>) and mj = ml + ms (with values j, j &minus; 1, . . .&minus; j).

<p>In many-electron atoms we have an analogous situation, be it that the electron-
</p>
<p>electron interactions have to be included from the very beginning. We focus first on
</p>
<p>free many-electron atoms or ions, i.e. atoms or ions in a zero or uniform external</p>

</p>
<p>field, for the time being neglecting any spin-orbit coupling. The total orbital angular
</p>
<p>moment operators L̂2, L̂z and the total spin angular moment operators Ŝ
2 and Ŝz com-
</p>
<p>mute with the Hamilton operator Ĥ where each electron moves in a field of spherical
</p>
<p>symmetry due to the nucleus and the field due the other electrons. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>eigenfunctions of Ĥ are in general also eigenfunctions of the other four operators.
</p>
<p>Only in the case of degenerate eigenstates of Ĥ one may choose (or find) eigenfunc-
</p>
<p>tions that are not simultaneously eigenfunctions of the other four operators. In that
</p>
<p>case, however, the eigenfunctions of Ĥ may always be rotated within the degenerate
</p>
<p>set to become also eigenfunctions of the other operators.
</p>
<p>This implies that these eigenfunctions of Ĥ can be labelled using the quantum
</p>
<p>numbers S, MS , L and ML . The energy eigenvalues only depend on the eigenvalues
</p>
<p>of L̂2 and Ŝ2, and not on MS and ML . Therefore, the degenerate set of eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>of the free-atom Hamiltonian corresponding to one eigenvalue of L̂2 and Ŝ2 can be
</p>
<p>labelled by their values for L and S. It has become customary to use as labels not the
</p>
<p>spin moment S and orbital moment L but rather the spin multiplicity 2S + 1 and L,
in the notation 2S+1L, where a spectroscopic notation S, P, D, F, G, . . . is used for
L = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . The degenerate set of (2S + 1) &times; (2L + 1) eigenfunctions of
2S+1L is commonly called an LS term. Examples of free atom (ion) LS terms are 1S,
2P, 4F, . . .
</p>
<p>Since there is a one-to-one correspondence of the different L eigenvalues with the
</p>
<p>irreducible representations (IR) of the spherical symmetry group SO(3), the labels
</p>
<p>of the LS terms are simultaneously symmetry labels. Note that the angular moment
</p>
<p>operators L̂x , L̂y, L̂z transform as the rotation operators R̂x , R̂y, R̂z, i.e. as P [1]. The
</p>
<p>behavior of atoms and ions, free and in compounds, depends for a large part on the
</p>
<p>ground term and the lowest excited terms. The symmetry of these lowest LS terms
</p>
<p>and the ordering of their energies can in general be well deduced using a simple one
</p>
<p>configuration model.
</p>
<p>So far we have not considered any relativistic effects for the atoms. In particu-
</p>
<p>lar, spin appears in the wave function but not in the non-relativistic Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>Traditionally, spin is introduced ad hoc to explain the splitting of a beam of silver
</p>
<p>atoms into two parts in the famous experiment of Stern and Gerlach in 1922. A sim-
</p>
<p>ilar splitting was observed for a beam of hydrogen atoms in a later experiment. The
</p>
<p>splitting indicates the presence of an angular moment, but it cannot be an orbital
</p>
<p>angular moment since both atoms have an L = 0 ground state. Therefore, the spin
property introduced to explain the splitting is considered to reflect an intrinsic angu-
</p>
<p>lar moment s, which for electrons must be 1/2, and hence it is concluded that each
</p>
<p>electron has an additional quantum number s = 1/2, with a z-component sz of either
+1/2 or &minus;1/2. The individual spin angular moments of the electrons in an atom can
be coupled together to give a total spin angular moment S, analogous to the coupling
</p>
<p>of the individual orbital angular moments l to a total angular moment L. Since there
</p>
<p>is no spin operator in the Hamiltonian, there is also no coupling between spin and
</p>
<p>orbital angular moment.</p>
<p/>

<p>36 2 One Magnetic Center
</p>
<p>The relativistic Hamilton operator for an electron can be derived, using the cor-
</p>
<p>respondence principle, from its relativistic classical Hamiltonian and this leads to
</p>
<p>the one-electron Dirac equation, which does contain spin operators. From the one-
</p>
<p>electron Dirac equation it seems trivial to define a many-electron relativistic equa-
</p>
<p>tion, but the generalization to more electrons is less straightforward than in the
</p>
<p>non-relativistic case, because the electron-electron interaction is not unambiguously
</p>
<p>defined. The non-relativistic Coulomb interaction is often used as a reasonable first
</p>
<p>approximation. The relativistic treatment of atoms and molecules based on the many-
</p>
<p>electron Dirac equation leads to so-called four-component methods. The name stems
</p>
<p>from the fact that the electronic wave functions consist of four instead of two compo-
</p>
<p>nents. When the couplings between spin and orbital angular moment are comparable
</p>
<p>to the electron-electron interactions this is the preferred way to explain the electronic
</p>
<p>structure of the lowest states.
</p>
<p>In most cases, however, the relativistic effects are rather weak and may be sepa-
</p>
<p>rated into spin-orbit coupling effects and scalar effects. The latter lead to compression
</p>
<p>and/or expansion of electron shells and can rather accurately be treated by modify-
</p>
<p>ing the one-electron part of the non-relativistic many-electron Hamiltonian. With this
</p>
<p>scalar-relativistic Hamiltonian the (modified) energies and wave functions are com-
</p>
<p>puted and subsequently an effective spin-orbit part ĤSO is added to the Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>The effects of the spin-orbit term on the energies and wave functions are commonly
</p>
<p>estimated using second-order perturbation theory. More information for the inter-
</p>
<p>ested reader can be found in excellent textbooks on relativistic quantum chemistry
</p>
<p>[2, 3].
</p>
<p>The standard way to include relativistic angular moment couplings in the notation
</p>
<p>of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the thus obtained energies and wave functions is
</p>
<p>the so-called Russell&ndash;Saunders coupling scheme. It is adequate if the spin-orbit cou-
</p>
<p>pling is considered to be weak compared to the electron-electron interactions. For a
</p>
<p>free atom or ion the Russell&ndash;Saunders scheme implies that the one-electron moments
</p>
<p>l and s are first coupled to a many-electron angular moment L and spin moment S,
</p>
<p>which are subsequently coupled to a total angular moment J . Due to the spin-orbit
</p>
<p>coupling the wave functions are no longer eigenfunctions of the L̂ and Ŝ operators
</p>
<p>(L and S are no longer &ldquo;good quantum numbers&rdquo;) but only of the Ĵ operator and the
</p>
<p>degeneracy of the states belonging to one LS term is partly removed. Only the states
</p>
<p>corresponding to a particular J eigenvalue are degenerate, but nevertheless the states
</p>
<p>of one LS term are close in energy. Such a set of nearly-degenerate states originating
</p>
<p>from one LS term is called a Russell&ndash;Saunders (RS) term and commonly denoted
</p>
<p>by a Russell-Saunders term symbol 2S+1LJ . For example, the lowest energy RS term
of an atom with a single valence p-electron is 2P1/2, with the RS term
</p>
<p>2P3/2 having
</p>
<p>a slightly higher energy. The 2P1/2 term is two-fold degenerate (MJ = 1/2,&minus;1/2)
while the 2P3/2 term is four-fold degenerate (MJ = 3/2, 1/2,&minus;1/2,&minus;3/2).</p>

</p>
<p>2.2 Give the Rusell&ndash;Saunders term symbol for the ground state of an atom
</p>
<p>with three electrons in the 2p orbitals.
</p>
<p>In cases where the spin-orbit coupling is strong compared to the electron-electron
</p>
<p>interactions it is more reasonable to account for the spin-orbit coupling by using
</p>
<p>the so-called j-j coupling scheme. Here the orbital moment l and the spin s of each
</p>
<p>electron are coupled to give an individual angular moment for each electron. The
</p>
<p>individual j for each electron are then coupled to give a total angular moment J .
</p>
<p>Modern relativistic many-electron quantum mechanical computational treatments
</p>
<p>are able to treat the entire range of angular moment couplings, from negligible to
</p>
<p>dominant spin-orbit coupling. The results can be expressed in either terms of Russell-
</p>
<p>Saunders states or in j-j coupled states, whatever representation gives better insight.
</p>
<p>For core-excited states where the core spin-orbit coupling is much larger than the
</p>
<p>valence spin-orbit coupling, a mixed notation is sometimes used, in which the open
</p>
<p>core shell is j-j coupled and the open valence shell is Russell&ndash;Saunders coupled.
</p>
<p>The many-electron states of an atom in a crystal field or a molecule can obviously
</p>
<p>not be labelled by the IRs of SO(3), since the Hamilton operator, the angular moment
</p>
<p>operator and therefore also the many-electron wave functions transform according
</p>
<p>to the IRs of a less symmetric point group. The lower symmetry may also remove
</p>
<p>the degeneracies of the LS terms. For example, the 2P ground term of a boron atom
</p>
<p>becomes 2T1u in an octahedral crystal field so that the three fold degeneracy is
</p>
<p>retained, but splits into two LS terms of 2E and 2A1 symmetry when the crystal field
</p>
<p>symmetry is lowered to C3v.

<p>The situation changes drastically when an external potential removes the degener-
</p>
<p>acy of the three functions. This can be caused by the crystal field exerted by the ions
</p>
<p>in an extended lattice for solid state compounds or by the ligands in the coordination
</p>
<p>sphere of an ion in a coordination complex. Although magnetic phenomena are more
</p>
<p>common for systems with incomplete d-shells, we will continue with our example
</p>
<p>concerning the p1 configuration for simplicity. Imagine an external potential that
</p>
<p>makes, for example, the state with one electron in the px orbital lowest in energy
</p>
<p>and places the other two orbitals at slightly higher energy. Then, the orbital angular
</p>
<p>moment of the ground state is defined from the matrix element 〈px|l̂|px〉 only, which
is zero as can be seen in the matrix 2.10. In many physics textbooks, this effect is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 The Eigenstates of Many-Electron Atoms 39
</p>
<p>called orbital angular moment quenching. On the other hand, if the external potential
</p>
<p>destabilizes px with respect to py,z, the orbital angular moment of the p
1 electronic
</p>
<p>configuration is defined by the lower-right 2&times;2 sub-block of matrix 2.10 and results
in non-zero expectation values. Now, the orbital angular moment is not quenched.
</p>
<p>The general condition for non-zero orbital angular moment for a given Russell-
</p>
<p>Saunders term 2S+1Γ is that the direct product Γ &times;Γ contains irreducible represen-
tations of the orbital moment operators L̂x,y,z. Since these operators have identical
</p>
<p>transformation properties as the rotation operator R̂x,y,z (which is usually listed in
</p>
<p>the character tables of the symmetry point groups), it is easier to work with the rota-
</p>
<p>tion operator. For example, the ground state of the d1 electronic configuration in an
</p>
<p>octahedral surrounding is 2T2g. The rotation operator transforms as T1g in the Oh
point group. Since the direct product T2g &times; T2g = A1g + Eg + T1g + T2g contains
the irreducible representation of the rotation operator, one expects a non-zero orbital
</p>
<p>angular moment for this system. Note, however, that the d1 electronic configuration
</p>
<p>is Jahn-Teller active and the geometry spontaneously distorts to a lower symmetry
</p>
<p>group accompanied by a (partial) quenching of the orbital angular moment.

</p>
<p>The first two columns of Fig. 2.1 show how the free atom levels of a d7 configuration
</p>
<p>are split by a distorted tetrahedral ligand-field. In this example, the states are labeled
</p>
<p>by the IR&rsquo;s of the D2d subgroup of Td and the
4F (with a degeneracy of (2S + 1)&times;
</p>
<p>(2L + 1) = 4 &times; 7 = 28) is split in five energy levels. Based on the discussion in
the previous section, one only expects a non-zero orbital moment for the 4E states.
</p>
<p>The inset of the figure zooms in on the levels of the 4B1 state and shows how the
</p>
<p>degeneracy is removed under the influence of spin-orbit coupling and when the
</p>
<p>system is placed in an external magnetic field. In the following two subsections we
</p>
<p>will discuss these two effects.
</p>
<p>2.3.1 Zero Field Splitting
</p>
<p>In 3d transition metal complexes, the splitting of the Russell&ndash;Saunders terms due to
</p>
<p>spin-orbit coupling is in general more important than the one caused by the external
</p>
<p>magnetic field typically used in EPR experiments. Therefore, the description of the</p>

representation of the many-electron wave function. The labelling in the inset is |J,MJ 〉
</p>
<p>energy levels in these systems starts in general by addressing the zero field situation.
</p>
<p>In the absence of an external field and assuming a quenched orbital angular moment,
</p>
<p>the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the levels of the ground state can be qualitatively
</p>
<p>analysed with second-order perturbation theory. The perturbation operator takes the
</p>
<p>following form
</p>
<p>V̂ = ζ L̂ &middot; Ŝ (2.11)
</p>
<p>with ζ a tabulated atomic spin-orbit parameter, determined either by calculation or
</p>
<p>extracted from experimental data. For those cases that the orbital angular moment of
</p>
<p>the ground state is zero, it is convenient to derive a model Hamiltonian to describe
</p>
<p>the sub-levels of the ground state that only depends on the spin variables. Therefore,
</p>
<p>we write the unperturbed vectors as the product of the |L,ML〉 spatial and |S,MS〉
spin parts. The spatial part of the ground state is represented with |0〉, and |κ〉 denotes
the spatial part of the excited states. The spin-only Hamiltonian that describes the
</p>
<p>zero-field splitting (no external magnetic field) of the levels is derived as the sum
</p>
<p>of first and second-order corrections. In first-order perturbation theory the energy
</p>
<p>correction equals
</p>
<p>〈0|V |0〉 = 〈S,MS|ζ Ŝ|S,MS〉〈0|L̂|0〉 (2.12)
</p>
<p>Independent of the value of S or MS , this product is strictly zero since we assumed
</p>
<p>that the ground state has no orbital angular moment. This is often referred to in the</p>

<p>find an orientation in space such that the tensor becomes diagonal (as will be shown
</p>
<p>below in a numerical example) and only three parameters remain. Furthermore, the
</p>
<p>tensor may be written in a traceless form (sum of the diagonal elements equal to zero)
</p>
<p>and then the spin Hamiltonian takes the following form with only two parameters

<p>construct a traceless tensor 	. Write out the product Ŝ 	 Ŝ and check that the

<p>outcome coincides with Eq. 2.15.
</p>
<p>The next step is to calculate the matrix elements of this zero-field splitting Hamil-
</p>
<p>tonian with the |S,MS〉 spin-functions of the ground state. The diagonalization of
the resulting matrix gives the energies of the sub-levels under the influence of the

<p>spin-orbit coupling with the sub-levels of higher lying electronic states. The matrix
</p>
<p>elements for the different dn configurations are well-documented in textbooks and
</p>
<p>articles and can be found in Appendix C. To illustrate the procedure we will derive
</p>
<p>the 〈1, 1| ĤZFS |1, 1〉 matrix element. To determine the effect of ĤZFS on |1, 1〉 we
need to know how Ŝ2x,y,z act on this function. Whereas |S,MS〉 are eigenfunctions of</p>

</p>
<p>Using Eq. 1.23, it is easily seen that the first and the last term give zero when applied

<p>on |1, 1〉 and that the other terms result in
</p>
<p>Ŝ&minus;Ŝ&minus;|1, 1〉 = 2|1,&minus;1〉 Ŝ+Ŝ&minus;|1, 1〉 = 2|1, 1〉 (2.18)
</p>
<p>which defines the action of Ŝ2 and Ŝ2x,y,z on |1, 1〉 as follows

<p>Ŝ2|1, 1〉 = S(S + 1)|1, 1〉 = 2|1, 1〉 Ŝ2z |1, 1〉 = |1, 1〉

<p>2.3 Further Removal of the Degeneracy of the N-electron States 43
</p>
<p>In systems with an even number of electrons and both D and E different from
</p>
<p>zero, the zero-field splitting completely removes the degeneracy of the ground state
</p>
<p>manifold. On the contrary, the levels in systems with an odd number of electrons
</p>
<p>remain doubly degenerate at zero-field, often referred to as Kramers doublets. For
</p>
<p>systems with integer spin moment, the wave function of the lowest level is dominated
</p>
<p>by the MS = 0 determinant when D is positive. This means that the projection of
the spin moment on the magnetic z-axis is (practically) zero, while the projection
</p>
<p>on the x&ndash;y plane is maximal; the system has easy plane magnetism. When D is
</p>
<p>negative, the largest contributions to the lowest level arise from the determinants
</p>
<p>with MS = &plusmn;MSmax , and hence, maximal projection of the spin moment on the z
axis. This is known as easy-axis magnetism. The same applies for half-integer spin
</p>
<p>moment systems.
</p>
<p>2.6 Demonstrate that the degeneracy of the MS = &plusmn;1/2 sub-levels of the
S = 1/2 manifold cannot be removed without an external magnetic field.
Hint: Calculate the 〈1/2,&plusmn;1/2|ĤZFS|1/2,&plusmn;1/2〉 matrix elements.
</p>
<p>2.3.2 Splitting in an External Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>The last column in Fig. 2.1 shows how an external magnetic field H affects the
</p>
<p>energies of the MS sublevels of the electronic manifolds of a paramagnetic material.
</p>
<p>This effect is described by the Zeeman Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>ĤZE = μBH &middot; (L̂ + geŜ) (2.23)
</p>
<p>When spin-orbit coupling is neglected and the ground state has no orbital moment,
</p>
<p>the expression reduces to its isotropic spin-only form
</p>
<p>ĤZE = μBgeH &middot; Ŝ (2.24)
</p>
<p>Defining the field direction as the z-axis, the Hamiltonian reduces to μBgeHŜz and
</p>
<p>the energies of the MS sublevels vary linearly with the field strength as
</p>
<p>En = MSμBgeH (2.25)
</p>
<p>Typical examples of such paramagnetic systems are organic radicals where spin-orbit
</p>
<p>coupling plays a minor role, but Eq. 2.25 can also be used to describe the evolution of
</p>
<p>the energy of the MS sublevels of the ground state in 3d transition metal complexes
</p>
<p>when the zero-field splitting is absent (S = 1/2) or significantly larger than the effect
of the external field and the spin-orbit interaction with excited states is small. This
</p>
<p>splitting of the energy levels with the external field is not only at the very origin</p>

<p>of electron paramagnetic resonance [4] techniques, but also manifests itself in the
</p>
<p>magnetic susceptibility of paramagnetic materials.
</p>
<p>When a material is placed in a magnetic field, the sample becomes magnetized
</p>
<p>and the magnetization M is related to the field strength H by
</p>
<p>&part;M
</p>
<p>&part;H
= χ (2.26)
</p>
<p>The magnetic susceptibility χ is material dependent. It is a tensor, although the
</p>
<p>sample can be oriented with respect to the external field such that it becomes diagonal.
</p>
<p>In most cases, χ can be written as the sum of a diamagnetic (χD) and a paramagnetic
</p>
<p>contribution (χP). The latter contribution is temperature dependent and normally
</p>
<p>dominates in systems with unpaired electrons, i.e. in paramagnetic materials. The
</p>
<p>diamagnetic contribution does not depend on the temperature and can be estimated
</p>
<p>rather accurately from tabulated data for atoms and groups of atoms present in the
</p>
<p>material or by empirical formula [5]. Therefore, it is commonly assumed that the
</p>
<p>magnetic susceptibility data have been corrected for this contribution and one only
</p>
<p>has to analyze the paramagnetic part. For weak magnetic fields (and not too low
</p>
<p>temperatures), χ is independent of H and the magnetization can be related to the
</p>
<p>field as
</p>
<p>M = χH (2.27)

<p>and quintet states. (b) Many researchers in the field of molecular magnetism use

<p>the cgsemu (centimeter-gram-second electromagnetic units) system instead of
</p>
<p>the standard units defined by the international systems of units SI. In this
</p>
<p>alternative unit system, the value of NAμ
2
B/3k is equal to 0.12505 (nearly
</p>
<p>1/8). Calculate C for the S-values that can be found for the TM ions and the
</p>
<p>lanthanides.
</p>
<p>Virtually always deviations to the Curie law are observed at low enough temper-
</p>
<p>atures, because the magnetic centers in any real system are never truly isolated but
</p>
<p>interact with their environment. Moreover, spin-orbit coupling can also introduce
</p>
<p>extra interactions not covered by the Curie law. The interactions with other magnetic
</p>
<p>centers will be addressed in more detail in Chap. 3, but we describe here a mean-field
</p>
<p>approach to include their effect. In this rather crude approximation, each magnetic
</p>
<p>center experiences an internal field due to the average interaction with the other
</p>
<p>centers in addition to the uniform external field. This internal field depends on the
</p>
<p>average magnetization (M) of the material and is known as the Weiss field
</p>
<p>H = Hext + Hint = Hext + λM (2.38)
</p>
<p>Combining this expression with the Eqs. 2.27 and 2.37 and assuming that H is aligned
</p>
<p>along z, one obtains
</p>
<p>χ = M
H
</p>
<p>= M
Hext + λM
</p>
<p>= C
T
</p>
<p>(2.39)
</p>
<p>Then, with Hext = M
(
(T &minus; Cλ)/C
</p>
<p>)
, the measured susceptibility χext can be written
</p>
<p>as
</p>
<p>χext =

<p>Hext

</p>
<p>T &minus; λC (2.40)
</p>
<p>known as the Curie-Weiss law. λC is the Weiss constant and often written as �.

<p>2.8 Derive Eq. 2.45 from Eq. 2.44.
</p>
<p>Anisotropy of the g-tensor: Before combining the effect of the zero-field splitting
</p>
<p>and the external magnetic field, we have to establish how spin-orbit coupling affects
</p>
<p>the Zeeman effect. This is most easily done for a system with S = 1
2
</p>
<p>and a quenched
</p>
<p>orbital moment. As an example, we will consider one unpaired electron. The g-factor
</p>
<p>in the Zeeman Hamiltonian of Eq. 2.24 is now replaced by a tensor
</p>
<p>ĤZE = μBgH &middot; Ŝ (2.48)
</p>
<p>g can be transformed to a diagonal form when the coordinate axis frames of the
</p>
<p>field and the g-tensor coincide. The axis frame that diagonalizes the g-tensor is not
</p>
<p>necessarily the same as the frame that diagonalizes the D-tensor introduced in the
</p>
<p>previous section, although this is often assumed to be the case. Furthermore, it should
</p>
<p>be noted that, strictly speaking S is not a good quantum number anymore when spin-
</p>
<p>orbit coupling is considered. Therefore, the spin operator in Eq. 2.48 is often replaced
</p>
<p>by an effective spin operator S̃ with the same formal properties.
</p>
<p>To evaluate the effect of spin-orbit coupling we will start writing down the first-
</p>
<p>order corrected wave functions of the MS = &plusmn; 12 sublevels, then calculate the matrix
elements of the Zeeman Hamiltonian (Eq. 2.23) and compare these to the matrix
</p>
<p>elements of the (effective) spin-only Zeeman Hamiltonian given in Eq. 2.48 to find
</p>
<p>analytical expressions for the diagonal elements of g. With ζ L̂ &middot; Ŝ as perturbation
operator, the wave functions that describe the lowest two levels become

II
</p>
<p>complex has three MS sublevels, which are degenerate in the absence of an external

<p>magnetic field and neglecting spin-orbit coupling. However, the interaction with
</p>
<p>the MS sublevels of excited states (T1, T2, S1, etc.) through the spin-orbit operator
</p>
<p>removes the degeneracy. Since the molecule is oriented in an arbitrary axes frame, the
</p>
<p>cartesian z-axis does not coincide with the magnetic z-axis and the wave functions of
</p>
<p>the three sublevels are complex functions, mixtures of the MS = 0,&plusmn;1 components.

<p>Two (or More) Magnetic Centers
</p>
<p>Abstract The description of the magnetic interactions is now extended to more
</p>
<p>than one magnetic center. First it is shown that the two-electron/two-orbital system
</p>
<p>can be approached from different viewpoints using (de-)localized, (non-)orthogonal
</p>
<p>orbitals. After this quantum chemical description of the magnetic interaction we dis-
</p>
<p>cuss the more phenomenological approach based on spin operators. Starting with
</p>
<p>the standard Heisenberg Hamiltonian for isotropic bilinear interactions, the chapter
</p>
<p>discusses how biquadratic, anisotropic and four-center interactions can be accounted
</p>
<p>for within this spin formalism. Furthermore, it is shown how the microscopic elec-
</p>
<p>tronic interaction parameters can be used to describe macroscopic properties by
</p>
<p>diagonalization of model Hamiltonians, Monte Carlo simulations and some other
</p>
<p>techniques.

<p>3.1 Localized Versus Delocalized Description
</p>
<p>of the Two-Electron/Two-Orbital Problem
</p>
<p>The most simple magnetic systems have only two magnetic sites, each with spin
1
2
. Examples are doubly bridged binuclear CuII complexes. The energy splitting
</p>
<p>between the lowest singlet and triplet spin states in such complexes turns out to
</p>
<p>depend strongly on the geometry of the bridging Cu&ndash;L2&ndash;Cu units (R1, R2, α, β, etc.)
</p>
<p>depicted in Fig. 3.1 and this magneto-structural correlation can be well explained by
</p>
<p>using simple quantum theoretical models that can be developed &ldquo;on the back of an
</p>
<p>envelope&rdquo;. The basis for such models is provided in this section, they are further
</p>
<p>elaborated in Chap.4. We consider a many-electron system, which, in addition to
</p>
<p>closed shells of electrons, has two magnetic electrons which are mainly localized
</p>
<p>on two magnetic sites A and B. We assume that the orbitals of the complex, i.e. its
</p>
<p>molecular orbitals (MOs), have been determined by a self-consistent field procedure.
</p>
<p>Configuration Interaction using delocalized orbitals: We first consider the case
</p>
<p>where the two magnetic electrons are coupled to a spin triplet, S = 1. The simplest
description of the MS = 1 component of the lowest lying triplet state is one single
Slater determinant

<p>The orbitals φ1 and φ2 are occupied with one electron and are often referred to as

<p>Φ12(1,&minus;1) = |φ1φ2| (3.2b)

a separate S = 0CSF. Figure3.2 represents the fourMS = 0CSFs. From left to right,
we have Ψ 11(0, 0), Ψ 12(0, 0) (plus combination), Ψ 12(1, 0) (minus combination),
</p>
<p>and Ψ 22(0, 0).
</p>
<p>The relative energies of the four states can of course be computed by performing a
</p>
<p>complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) calculation with the active
</p>
<p>orbitals being φ1 and φ2, but here we are going to analyze the relative energies by
</p>
<p>considering the physics of the system.
</p>
<p>If the splitting between the bonding φ1 and the antibonding φ2 is large, the ground
</p>
<p>state is expected to be a spin singlet state, which is rather well described byΦ11(0, 0).
</p>
<p>This is the situation that we would encounter, for example, if the ions A and B would
</p>
<p>be two Li atoms without any environment forming a Li2 molecule, or, even simpler,
</p>
<p>two H atoms forming H2. In these cases the stabilization of φ1 is so large that the two
</p>
<p>electrons pair to occupy jointly this strongly bonding orbital. However, in magnetic
</p>
<p>systems the interaction between the magnetic ions A and B is quite weak. Moreover,
</p>
<p>inmost complexes they are separated by bridging ligands. Then, the splitting between
</p>
<p>φ1 and φ2 is small and the three configurations . . . φ

</p>
<p>1

</p>
<p>1
2 and . . . φ
</p>
<p>2
2 are close
</p>
<p>in energy. The fact that we have three distinct low lying singlet CSFs suggests that we
</p>
<p>can use variation theory to generate improved descriptions of these three states, by
</p>
<p>forming linear combinations ofΦ11(0, 0),Φ12(0, 0) andΦ22(0, 0). On the contrary,
</p>
<p>in order to improve the description of the S = 1 state we would have to go beyond
the two electrons in two orbitals model, but doing this only for the triplet and not
</p>
<p>for the singlet states would destroy the balance between them, preventing us from
</p>
<p>determining whether the ground state is magnetic (S �= 0) or not (S = 0).
In many cases the A&ndash;B system is centrosymmetric, i.e. there is at least one sym-
</p>
<p>metry operation that transforms A into B and vice versa. Then φ1 and φ2 belong
</p>
<p>to different irreducible symmetry representations, and consequently the wave func-</p>

<p>Then, improved singlet variational wave functions can be formed by making linear

and 〈Φ11(0, 0)|Ĥ |Φ12(0, 0)〉. In the following we will assume symmetry, hence
assume that these matrix elements are zero and turn our attention to the Hamil-

<p>Valence Bond theory using localized orthogonal orbitals: For small couplings,

<p>i.e. nearly degenerate S = 0 and S = 1 states, Valence Bond (VB) theory provides
a more intuitive starting point than the previous molecular orbital reasoning. For the
</p>
<p>MS = 0 wave functions we make use of the local orthonormal orbitals ψa and ψb as
defined in Eq.3.10a and use them to construct two neutral determinants |ψaψb| and
|ψbψa |, where neutral does not mean that the centers A and B are uncharged, but
maintain their oxidation state as in the ground configuration. Moreover, two ionic
</p>
<p>determinants are defined: |ψaψa | and |ψbψb|. The simplest VB wave function for
the lowest singlet state has the form

wave functions of Eq.3.16 for S = 0 and of Eq.3.13 for S = 1, MS = 0.
</p>
<p>We can now draw the following conclusions:
</p>
<p>&bull; If we limit ourselves to using (apart from the doubly occupied orbitals) only
two mutually orthogonal orbitals, either bonding and antibonding φa and φb, or
</p>
<p>localized ψa and ψb, then the best wave function for the lowest triplet state is
</p>
<p>the one given in Eq.3.2 or, equivalently, 3.13a and the best wave function for the

</p>
<p>using Eq.3.18.
</p>
<p>It is not difficult to show that in order to make the singlet state the ground state, the
</p>
<p>magnetic orbitals have to overlap considerably. However, atomic magnetic orbitals
</p>
<p>such as first row transition metal 3d orbitals are quite compact and their mutual over-
</p>
<p>lap, especially in compounds where they are separated by bridging ions, is negligible.
</p>
<p>This suggests that in such systems only the direct exchange, would play a role, lead-
</p>
<p>ing to parallel or ferromagnetic spin coupling. But in reality we have many systems
</p>
<p>whose nearest neighbour paramagnetic ions have antiferromagnetic spin coupling.
</p>
<p>Already in 1934 Kramers attempted to explain the magnetic interaction in antifer-
</p>
<p>romagnetic ionic solids, by noting that it is possible to have a two-center spin coupling
</p>
<p>that is mediated by the bridging non-magnetic atoms. He called this bridge-mediated
</p>
<p>spin coupling superexchange. In 1959 Anderson described the physical basis respon-
</p>
<p>sible for the generation of this superexchange: It is simply that spin-paired elec-
</p>
<p>trons can gain energy by spreading into nonorthogonal overlapping orbitals, whereas
</p>
<p>unpaired electrons cannot. The model of Anderson is easiest illustrated by consid-
</p>
<p>ering again a centrosymmetric system of two magnetic ions A and B, for example
</p>
<p>Cu2+ ions, with (apart from electrons in double occupied orbitals) one unpaired elec-
tron in a 3d-orbital, which are separated by a closed shell anion such as Cl&minus; or O2&minus;
</p>
<p>with (formally) three doubly occupied valence p orbitals. We denote the relevant
</p>
<p>atomic 3d functions χa and χb. It turns out that for structural and symmetry reasons
</p>
<p>commonly only one of the three valence p orbitals plays a role, so we consider only
</p>
<p>one bridging atomic function χh . We now allow the localized magnetic orbitals to
</p>
<p>have optimum admixture of the bridging ligand function:
</p>
<p>φa = caχa + chχh φb = cbχb + c&prime;hχh (3.19)

</p>
<p>approach, in which the active electrons are the magnetic electrons, the active orbitals
</p>

</p>
<p>spatial orientation of spin&mdash;the isotropic part, parametrized by the scalar J&mdash;and
</p>
<p>another part that models the anisotropy of the interaction parametrizing it with a
</p>
<p>diagonal tensor D.
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;J

Ŝx,1 Ŝx,2 + Ŝy,1 Ŝy,2 + Ŝz,1 Ŝz,2

<p>+ Dxx Ŝx,1 Ŝx,2 + Dyy Ŝy,1 Ŝy,2 + Dzz Ŝz,1 Ŝz,2 (3.22)
</p>
<p>The minus sign in front of J is by convention, but be aware that other definitions are
</p>
<p>often used in the literature. Negative J -values indicate antiferromagnetic coupling
</p>
<p>and positive values are characteristic of ferromagnetic interactions in the definition
</p>
<p>that we use here.
</p>
<p>3.2.1 Heisenberg Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>For themoment, we leave aside the anisotropic part of the interaction and concentrate
</p>
<p>on the isotropic part. The equation can then be written in the following from
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;J Ŝ1 &middot; Ŝ2 (3.23)
</p>
<p>which is known as the Heisenberg or Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>For systems with two magnetic sites, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are easily
</p>
<p>derived by rewriting the product of local operators using the relation
</p>
<p>Ŝ2 = (Ŝ1 + Ŝ2)2 = Ŝ21 + Ŝ22 + 2Ŝ1 &middot; Ŝ2 (3.24)
</p>
<p>from this follows
</p>
<p>Ŝ1 &middot; Ŝ2 =
1
</p>
<p>2
(Ŝ2 &minus; Ŝ21 &minus; Ŝ22 ) (3.25)
</p>
<p>which leads to an alternative formulation of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;1
2
J (Ŝ2 &minus; Ŝ21 &minus; Ŝ22 ) (3.26)

<p>where S runs from S1 + S2 to |S1 &minus; S2|. This regular Land&eacute; pattern gives the exact
energy differences as long as the interaction with excited electronic configurations

<p>is negligible and is the basis for extracting magnetic coupling parameters from elec-
</p>

</p>
<p>In systems with multiple magnetic sites, the number of energy differences between
</p>
<p>the different spin functions is not always enough to determine all the J -values. An
</p>
<p>obvious example is the three-center/three-electron case as depicted in Fig. 3.5. The
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian has three different J -values while the quartet and the two doublet states
</p>
<p>only define two energy differences. The effective Hamiltonian theory described in
</p>
<p>Chap.1 is a more general approach to extract J -values, because it not only uses
</p>
<p>the energies but also information contained in the wave function. To illustrate the
</p>
<p>procedure we first treat a simple biradical model with two S = 1

<p>focus on the three center problem.

In the next step, we build an effective Hamiltonian that connects the ab initio results
</p>
<p>with the model Hamiltonian. In the first place the wave functions are projected on
</p>
<p>the model space and orthonormalized:
</p>
<p>Projections: Ψ̃T = 0.7029|φ1φ̄2| + 0.7029|φ̄1φ2|
Ψ̃S = 0.6776|φ1φ̄2| &minus; 0.6776|φ̄1φ2|

〈Ψ̃S|Ψ̃S〉 = 0.67762 + 0.67762 = 0.9183
</p>
<p>Normalized projections: Ψ̃ NT = 0.707107|φ1φ̄2| + 0.707107|φ̄1φ2|
Ψ̃ NS = 0.707107|φ1φ̄2| &minus; 0.707107|φ̄1φ2|
〈Ψ̃ NT |Ψ̃ NS 〉 = 0
</p>
<p>In the next step, the effectiveHamiltonian is constructed by substituting these normal-

<p>ized projections and the corresponding energies in the Bloch equation as discussed

<p>The basis of the effective Hamiltonian is the same as for the Heisenberg Hamil-

</p>
<p>(3.38)
</p>
<p>The two Hamiltonians (Eqs. 3.34 and 3.38) can only be compared when they have
</p>
<p>the same zero of energy. Therefore the diagonal matrix elements of the Heisen-
</p>
<p>berg Hamiltonian are shifted by &minus; 1
4
J and those of the effective Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>by &minus;29.440025 Eh. The comparison shows that there is a one-to-one correspon-
dence between both matrices and that the magnetic coupling parameter is equal to
</p>
<p>&minus;2 &times; 0.001726 Eh = &minus;757.6cm&minus;1. In this simple case, the eigenfunctions of the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian are the same as those of Ŝ2; Ψ1 and Ψ2 are directly the
</p>
<p>singlet and triplet functions, respectively. Hence J is also given by the difference
</p>
<p>of the singlet and triplet energies: J = ES &minus; ET = &minus;29.441751 &minus; &minus;29.43830 =
&minus;0.003452 Eh = &minus;757.6 cm&minus;1.
</p>
<p>However, the extraction strategy based on effective Hamiltonians is generally
</p>
<p>applicable and in cases where the energies of the different spin states do not provide
</p>
<p>enough information to determine all the magnetic coupling parameters one necessar-
</p>
<p>ily has to rely on the effective Hamiltonian procedure. The three different magnetic
</p>
<p>coupling strengths J12, J13 and J23 of the three center/three electron case of Fig. 3.5
</p>
<p>cannot be extracted from the two energy differences defined by the quartet and the

<p>3.2.2 Ising Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>The elimination of the anisotropic part in Eq.3.22 leads to the Heisenberg Hamil-
</p>
<p>tonian for isotropic magnetic interactions. The spins are considered as co-linear
</p>
<p>vectors whose principal quantization axis has no spatially preferred orientation. An
</p>
<p>even simpler model Hamiltonian can be obtained by putting Axx and Ayy to zero in
</p>
<p>Eq.3.21. Then, the spin reduces to a classical vector whose orientation in space is
</p>
<p>not defined and the resulting model Hamiltonian describes the isotropic coupling of
</p>
<p>two (anti-)parallel spins. Replacing Azz by &minus;J, the following expression is obtained
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;J Ŝz,1 Ŝz,2 (3.45)
</p>
<p>which is known as the Ising Hamiltonian. The big advantage of this simpler Hamil-
</p>
<p>tonian is the fact that the eigenfunctions correspond tomonodeterminantal functions,
</p>
<p>and therefore, this Hamiltonian can be used to determine the magnetic coupling
</p>
<p>strength from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in extended systems
</p>
<p>treated in the periodic approximation. This is further discussed in the next chapters
</p>
<p>in Sects. 4.3.4 and 6.3. For now, we will restrict ourselves to some formal properties
</p>
<p>of the Ising Hamiltonian and a comparison with the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. To
</p>
<p>determine the magnetic coupling of the two-electron/two-orbital problem, two func-
</p>
<p>tions are needed describing parallel and anti-parallel coupling, |φ1φ2| and |φ1φ̄2|.
By acting with the Ising Hamiltonian on these two function we get</p>

<p>Assuming that the spatial part is identical in both functions (only spin degrees of

<p>freedom are taken into account for the moment), the energy difference between the
</p>
<p>two determinants gives an estimate of the magnetic coupling through ELS &minus; EHS =

</p>
<p>to the parallel alignment. This expression is easily generalized to a pair of arbitrary

<p>ELS &minus; EHS = 2S1S2 J (3.48)
</p>
<p>In any real case, the orbital part plays an important role and the influence of this on the
</p>
<p>extraction of the J -value from calculations will be discussed in the next chapter. The
</p>
<p>dimeric system S1 = S2 = 12 only has HS and LS states, but for systems with higher
spins there are several intermediate states. Remembering that the eigenfunctions
</p>
<p>of the Ising Hamiltonian are not necessarily spin eigenfunctions, we use a label to
</p>
<p>characterize the eigenfunctions that consists of the MS-value of the two magnetic
</p>
<p>centers. Then the HS determinant is |&plusmn; 1

〉 and the LS state is represented as

<p>be defined. The HS and LS states are separated by 2J as follows from the above
</p>
<p>equation, but in between these two, there is a set of five determinants with MS = 0
functions on one or both magnetic centers with an expectation value equal to zero.

degenerate first excited states of the Ising Hamiltonian is given by the value of the

<p>3.2.3 Comparing the Heisenberg and Ising Hamiltonians
</p>
<p>Table3.1 compares some formal properties of the Ising and the Heisenberg Hamil-
</p>
<p>tonian for symmetric dimeric systems with different spin moments. The spectral
</p>
<p>width W&mdash;defined as the difference between the lowest and highest eigenvalue&mdash;
</p>
<p>increases with the spin moment for both Hamiltonians. In absolute values the dif-
</p>
<p>ference between Ising and Heisenberg grows larger, but it should be noted that the
</p>
<p>relative difference is significantly smaller for the system with S = 5/2 (16.7%) than
for the S = 1/2 case (50%). For antiferromagnetic coupling (negative J ), the first
excited state of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian is always a threefold degenerate triplet
</p>
<p>state with a relative energy equal to J . In the Isingmodel, the gap depends linearly on
</p>
<p>the spin moment. For S = 1/2, the gap is smaller than in the Heisenberg model, but
for the S = 5/2 system the separation of the ground state and the first excited state is
much larger in the Isingmodel. In the case of ferromagnetic interaction, the spectrum
</p>
<p>of the Ising Hamiltonian is simply inverted, being symmetric around E = 0. This
is not the case for the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Except for the S = 1/2 system, the
gap between ground and first excited state is larger, as is the degeneracy of the latter.

<p>3.2 Model Spin Hamiltonians for Isotropic Interactions 77
</p>
<p>These eigenstates share the common feature that at least one of the local MS values
</p>
<p>is not equal to &plusmn;MmaxS . For example the Ising eigenstates in Fig. 3.6 with energy J
have either on the left or the right (or both) centers an αβ determinant. As soon as
</p>
<p>one adds the spatial part to the wave function, these determinants are raised in energy
</p>
<p>since they lack the stabilization by the exchange integral K present in the energy
</p>
<p>expression of the |αα| and |ββ| determinants. Consequently, in any practical appli-
cation focused on magnetic interactions one should only consider the eigenstates of
</p>
<p>the Ising Hamiltonian with MS = 0 or MmaxS .
</p>
<p>3.3 From Micro to Macro: The Bottom-Up Approach
</p>
<p>In Sect. 2.3.2, we have shown how the temperature dependence of the magnetic
</p>
<p>susceptibility can be calculated based on the knowledge of the energy levels of
</p>
<p>the ion in a magnetic field. Substituting an analytical expression in the van Vleck
</p>
<p>equation, we derived the Curie law for paramagnetic systems without interaction
</p>
<p>between the magnetic centers. The same strategy can be followed for systems in
</p>
<p>which the interaction between the magnetic centers cannot be neglected, such as
</p>
<p>those discussed in this chapter so far. At difference with the derivation of Curie&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>law for isolated magnetic ions, we no longer can ignore the excited states and have
</p>
<p>to substitute E (0) by Eq.3.28 in the van Vleck equation (Eq.2.33). Using the same
</p>
<p>expression as before for E (1) we obtain

</p>
<p>This is rather trivial as long as dimeric systems are concerned, because there is
</p>
<p>actually only one parameter in the analytical expression of χ and no new information
</p>
<p>is obtained by calculating χ(T ) from the theoretical estimates of the J -value. The
</p>
<p>situation is different when polynuclear systems are considered. Most importantly,
</p>
<p>there are not many systems for which an exact expression of χ has been derived. In
</p>
<p>addition to the above stated expression for binuclear complexes, Boča derived expres-
</p>
<p>sion for tri- and tetra-nuclear systems [3], which turn out to be rather lengthy. The
</p>
<p>situation is even more complicated for extended systems, which have (in principle)
</p>
<p>an infinite number of interacting magnetic centers.
</p>
<p>In fact, the one-dimensional uniform Heisenberg chain is the only extended sys-
</p>
<p>tem for which an exact solution has been derived making use of the Bethe Ansatz [4].
</p>
<p>Bonner and Fisher extended this T = 0 solution to finite temperatures by extrap-
olating the results obtained for small chains to chains of infinite length [5]. The
</p>
<p>Bonner-Fisher expression is still widely used to fit magnetic susceptibility data to

in the fitting procedure. Improvements upon the Bonner-Fisher expression for low

<p>More general expressions were derived by Cur&eacute;ly for S �= 1/2, for 2D lattices with
different magnetic interaction paths (Fig. 3.7 middle) and to hexagonal (or honey-
</p>
<p>comb) lattices (Fig. 3.7 right) [10, 11].
</p>
<p>When no analytical expression can be used to fit χ(T ), the experimental data
</p>
<p>are interpreted by defining a magnetic model with the magnetic interactions that are
</p>
<p>considered a priori to be the most important ones. The corresponding Heisenberg
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian is then diagonalized and the resulting eigenvalues are substituted in
</p>
<p>the van Vleck equation. The J -values of the magnetic model are adjusted to give
</p>
<p>an optimal fit of the experimental data. However, one has to be aware that a multi-
</p>
<p>parameter fit can have several solutions of equal quality and that this way of deriving
</p>
<p>experimental J -values can be subject to uncertainties. Actually, this is where com-
</p>
<p>putations can be helpful to discern the important interactions from less important
</p>
<p>ones and determine the sign and order of magnitude of the interactions. This would
</p>
<p>in principle lead to a well-founded magnetic model that will lead to reliable J -values
</p>
<p>from the fitting procedure.
</p>
<p>A closely related procedure allows theoreticians to take the full journey from
</p>
<p>microscopic to macroscopic in a three-step strategy [12]. In the first stage, one calcu-
</p>
<p>lates as exhaustive as possible the interactions among the different magnetic centers.
</p>
<p>This should not be restricted to nearest neighbors and preferably also include three- or
</p>
<p>four-body interactions, see Sect. 3.4. Secondly, a magnetic model is defined by writ-
</p>
<p>ing down the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with the most important interactions. When
</p>
<p>dealingwith an extended system, periodic boundary conditions can be applied. This is
</p>
<p>best illustrated taking the 1D Heisenberg chain as example. As illustrated in Fig. 3.8,
</p>
<p>the first center in the chain not only interacts with center 2 on the right, but also with
</p>
<p>the last center in the chain. In this way, there is no open end in the chain, exactly as in
</p>
<p>an infinite 1D chain. The topology of the model is actually a ring, but this turns out</p>

<p>actual model is a closed ring of five centers
</p>
<p>to be a very accurate representation of the 1D chain provided a large enough number
</p>
<p>of centers is considered. Finally, the Hamiltonian is diagonalized and the resulting
</p>
<p>eigenvalues are substituted in the van Vleck equation to obtain the magnetic sus-
</p>
<p>ceptibility as function of the temperature from a rigorous ab initio treatment. The
</p>
<p>eigenvalues can of course also be used to derive any other macroscopic property such
</p>
<p>as the specific heat at constant magnetic field (CB) by using the appropriate equation
</p>
<p>from standard statistical mechanics.
</p>
<p>Inter- and intramolecular interactions: Generally speaking, transitionmetal based
</p>
<p>magnetic materials have large intramolecular interactions and weaker intermolecular
</p>
<p>interactions. Nevertheless, the control and understanding of the macroscopic prop-
</p>
<p>erties depends critically on the knowledge of both types of interactions. Imagine a
</p>
<p>building block with two antiferromagnetically coupled spin moments as schemati-
</p>
<p>cally depicted in the upper panel of Fig. 3.9. The interaction of the spin moments
</p>
<p>on the transition metals proceeds through the bridging ligand as will be profoundly
</p>
<p>analyzed in Chap.5 and is also known as a through-bond interaction. Using transi-
</p>
<p>tion metals with different spins (S1 �= S2) causes that the unit has a net magnetic
moment, despite the antiferromagnetic nature of the interaction. This is known as
</p>
<p>ferrimagnetism. The middle panel shows that a proper choice of the external ligands
</p>
<p>can link these building blocks into an infinite chain of antiferromagnetically cou-
</p>
<p>pled magnetic centers. Such entity is of course a very interesting object due to the
</p>
<p>net magnetic moment, however to take profit of this, one has to stick these chains
</p>
<p>together in a three-dimensional structure such that the chains are ferromagnetically
</p>
<p>coupled to each other as shown in the lower panel. This interchain coupling is typ-
</p>
<p>ically much weaker as it does not involve magnetic centers that are connected by
</p>
<p>(covalent) bonds, and is usually referred to as through-space interaction. By carefully
</p>
<p>choosing the magnetic centers and the coordinating ligands, Kahn and co-workers
</p>
<p>were able to design and synthesize molecular-based magnets, initially with rather
</p>
<p>low critical temperatures for long-range order [13], but later many compounds have
</p>
<p>been reported with long-range order at much higher temperatures.

</p>
<p>However, the dimension g of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian grows rapidly with the

<p>up to 40 centers, which for most practical applications seems to be large enough.

<p>However, for larger models and for larger spin moment, it can be useful to consider

<p>written in terms of properties that only depend on half the number of centers
</p>
<p>Q(N , K ) = f (K )N/2Q(N/2, K &prime;) (3.63)
</p>
<p>and the recursive application of this formula connects the microscopic description
</p>
<p>with the thermodynamic large-scale properties. To elaborate the procedure a little
</p>
<p>more we use the relation of the free energy A and the partition function as given by
</p>
<p>statistical mechanics
</p>
<p>ln Q(N , K ) = A&minus;kT = Nξ(K ) (3.64)
</p>
<p>The free energy can be used to determine the specific heat and the temperature depen-
</p>
<p>dence of the specific heat can tell us something about the possible order-disorder
</p>
<p>phase transitions in magnetic systems. A is an extensive property and hence depends
</p>
<p>on the system size. It is here conveniently written as a product of the system size
</p>
<p>(N ) and a system-size independent parameter ξ, which can be considered as the free
</p>
<p>energy per site.

Eq. 3.63. This brings us to the recursion relations to go froma descriptionwith N indi-

<p>The one-dimensional Ising chain is not the most interesting magnetic system to
</p>
<p>study with renormalization theory, since it is known from the exact solution that
</p>
<p>there is no phase transition, the chain is disordered at any finite temperature. The
</p>
<p>two-dimensional Ising lattice does have an order/disorder phase transition, nicely
</p>
<p>reproduced with the renormalization procedure as discussed in Refs. [15, 16]. Such
</p>
<p>phase transition does not exist in a two-dimensional lattice describedwith theHeisen-
</p>
<p>berg Hamiltonian. For this model, a non-zero interaction along the third dimension is
</p>
<p>needed to have an ordered (anti-)ferromagnetic system at finite temperature as stated
</p>
<p>by the Mermin-Wagner theorem.
</p>
<p>Monte Carlo simulations: An alternative strategy to calculate thermodynamic prop-
</p>
<p>erties is to explicitly follow the trajectory of amagnetic system by a computer simula-
</p>
<p>tion of the system. Along such trajectory, the system will adopt many conformations
</p>
<p>with different energy, magnetization and other microscopic observables. If the sam-
</p>
<p>pling of the conformational space is done correctly, a good estimate of the partition
</p>
<p>function can be made and with this all type of thermodynamic functions can be
</p>
<p>calculated.
</p>
<p>There are basically two types of simulations to sample the conformational space.
</p>
<p>The first one is known as Molecular Dynamics and propagates a system in time by
</p>
<p>integrating the Newton&rsquo;s equations of motion. In its most rudimentary form the pro-
</p>
<p>cedure can be described as follows. For a given set of atomic positions r(t = t0),
one calculates the forces and from these the velocities v(t0), accelerations a(t0) and
</p>
<p>usually some higher derivatives. The atoms are then moved from r(t0) to r(t0 +∆t)
by the formula r(t0 +∆t) = r(t0)+ v(t0)∆t + (1/2)a(t0)∆t2 + . . . and the time is
updated from t0 to t0 + ∆t . Then the cycle is repeated as long as one wants to fol-
low the trajectory. The second method, the so-called Monte Carlo method, does not
</p>
<p>propagate the system in time but rather performs a random walk through the confor-
</p>
<p>mational space to calculate the partition function. Whereas numerical integration on
</p>
<p>a regular grid is much more efficient for low-dimensional functions, such approach
</p>
<p>is absolutely out of the question for extremely high dimensional functions, such as
</p>
<p>the partition function for any interesting N -particle system. In these cases a smart
</p>
<p>random walk is more effective and can be used to extract macroscopic properties as
</p>
<p>function of microscopic interactions.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the procedure, we come back to the Ising model, but now focusing on
</p>
<p>the two-dimensional latticewith nearest neighbour interactions only. The sampling of
</p>
<p>the conformational space is usually done with theMetropolis algorithm, which starts
</p>
<p>by creating the initial spin conformation S0. This can be done in many ways, one of
</p>
<p>them is assigning a random spin direction MS = &plusmn; 12 to each lattice point as shown
in the left part of Fig. 3.11. After calculating the energy of this spin distribution, a
</p>
<p>trial step in conformational space is taken by inverting the spin at one of the lattice</p>
<p/>

<p>Fig. 3.11 Left Initial spin distribution S0 on a small part of the N &times; N spin lattice. Right Trial spin
distribution St after inverting the MS value of the black spin. Depending on the energy change, the
</p>
<p>new distribution can be accepted or rejected
</p>
<p>sites to generate St . The step is accepted when exp(&minus;∆E/kBT ) is larger than a
uniformly chosen random number between 0 and 1 and rejected otherwise (∆E is
</p>
<p>the energy difference of St and S0). This means that trial spin distributions with
</p>
<p>lower energy are always accepted, while trial conformations with higher energies
</p>
<p>are accepted through an exponential weighting function. The closer the value of the
</p>
<p>exponential to 1 (that is, for small ∆E), the larger the chance for accepting the new
</p>
<p>conformation. Figure3.12 shows how the ratio between accepted and rejected steps
</p>
<p>(γ ) smoothly converges to an exponential function of the energy difference with an
</p>
<p>increasing number of steps in the conformational space.

J (3.68)
</p>
<p>and from here the energy difference ∆E = &minus;J . When J &gt; 0, that is for ferromag-
netic interactions, the step is accepted because the energy of the system is lowered by
</p>
<p>the spin flip. Instead for antiferromagnetic interactions, J &lt; 0, the energy difference
</p>
<p>is positive and the step will only be accepted when the exp(&minus;∆E/kBT ) is larger than
a random number between 0 and 1. Subsequently, the neighbouring spin is flipped
</p>
<p>and the accept/reject algorithm is repeated for all sites on the lattice. Then the total
</p>
<p>energy and magnetization (or other properties) are calculated and accumulated to
</p>
<p>determine the average properties after a certain amount of sweeps over the lattice.
</p>
<p>In addition to the very basic application to the two-dimensional latticewith nearest
</p>
<p>neighbour interactions, this rather simple and intuitive approach to calculate ther-
</p>
<p>modynamic properties can of course also be used to study magnetic systems with
</p>
<p>more complex magnetic structures. However, it fails badly when it comes to mag-
</p>
<p>netic interactions between centers with spin moments different from S = 1
2
. In the
</p>
<p>basic form described above each lattice site can only adopt two states: up or down;
</p>
<p>α or β; positive or negative MS . No distinction can be made between a lattice of
</p>
<p>magnetic sites with S = 1
2
and any higher spin moment. For this purpose, the model
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian needs to be improved and a natural thing to do is to replace the Ising
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian with the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. An important drawback of using this
</p>
<p>more accurate model Hamiltonian is that the total energy of the lattice is no longer
</p>
<p>a simple sum of individual contributions as in the Ising case, and hence, the energy
</p>
<p>of a spin configuration cannot be calculated directly. Instead one can introduce two
</p>
<p>levels of accuracy in the Metropolis algorithm [17]. To decide on the acceptance of
</p>
<p>a spin flip the energy of a small cluster around the active lattice site is calculated
</p>
<p>with the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, while the rest of the lattice is considered as an
</p>
<p>Ising system. Keeping the cluster small enough, sweeping the lattice can be done
</p>
<p>rather efficiently in this half classic/half quantum treatment of the spin interactions.
</p>
<p>To study magnetic phenomena at low temperatures, one should definitely consider a
</p>
<p>full Quantum Monte Carlo approach [18].

<p>The isotropic bilinear operator discussed so far is the most widely considered inter-
</p>
<p>action in polynuclear magnetic systems since it accounts for an important part of the
</p>
<p>physics. However, it is not the whole story. In the very beginning of this chapter, we</p>

<p>88 3 Two (or More) Magnetic Centers
</p>
<p>have set aside the spatial anisotropy in the interaction between two spin moments.
</p>
<p>Furthermore we have assumed that the interaction can be described with a simple
</p>
<p>vector product of linear operators and that more-than-two particle interactions are
</p>
<p>irrelevant. In this section, we will discuss refinements of the standard Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>and see how more complex interactions can be incorporated in the description of the
</p>
<p>magnetic couplings.

</p>
<p>centers. A straightforward fitting of the magnetic susceptibility with just the two-
</p>
<p>body interactions leads to the conclusion that the magnetic interaction along the legs
</p>
<p>is twice as large as the interactions along the rungs of the ladder. However, the local
</p>
<p>geometry does not support such a large difference; distances, angles, coordination
</p>
<p>are all very similar in both cases. Extending the model Hamiltonian used to fit
</p>
<p>experimental data with four-body interactions provides amore consistent picture: the
</p>
<p>interactions along leg and rung are similar and the four-body interaction is sizeable.
</p>
<p>Toget a handon the four-body interactions, the four-center clusterABCDshown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.13 is studied. The four magnetic centers, A . . . D, have one unpaired electron,
</p>
<p>and therefore, a magnetic moment of S = 1/2. The Hamiltonian of this system is
a sum of the standard two-body interactions plus P̂1234, a four-body operator that
</p>
<p>cyclically permutes the four spin functions.
</p>
<p>Ĥ =
&sum;
</p>
<p>i&lt; j
</p>
<p>&minus;Ji j Ŝi &middot; Ŝ j + Jr P̂1234 (3.76)
</p>
<p>To stay within a spin Hamiltonian formalism, the permutation operator has to be
</p>
<p>replaced by spin operators, which can be done in the following way [19]:
</p>
<p>P̂1234 = κ
(
(ŜA &middot; ŜB)(ŜC &middot; ŜD)+ (ŜA &middot; ŜD)(ŜB &middot; ŜC )&minus; (ŜA &middot; ŜC )(ŜB &middot; ŜD)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>(3.77)
</p>
<p>To check that this sum indeed cyclically permutes the spin functions, we compare
</p>
<p>the outcome of acting with P̂1234 and acting with the sum of bilinear operators on
</p>
<p>the wave function Ψ = αβαβ &minus; βαβα.</p>
<p/>

<p>92 3 Two (or More) Magnetic Centers
</p>
<p>P̂1234(αβαβ &minus; βαβα) = βαβα &minus; αβαβ (3.78)
</p>
<p>Note that the wave function with only one of the terms is not an eigenfunction of the
</p>
<p>permutation operator P̂1234. To determine the result of the sum of four-spin operators,
</p>
<p>we will develop step-by-step the action of (ŜA &middot; ŜD)(ŜB &middot; ŜC ). The other two terms
can be done by the reader as an exercise. In the first place, we need to establish the
</p>
<p>result of acting with Ŝi &middot; Ŝ j on the different two-electron determinants. By writing Ŝ
as Ŝx + Ŝy + Ŝz and using Eq.1.20a, the following relations are easily derived:

</p>
<p>Before looking at the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian, it should be mentioned that
</p>
<p>P̂1234 is not the only way to cyclically permute the four spin functions. Alternatively,
</p>
<p>one can apply the P̂1324 and P̂1423 operators to shift them around the rectangle as
</p>
<p>illustrated in Fig. 3.14. These possibilities are carefully worked out in Ref. [20],
</p>
<p>where the corresponding interaction parameters were shown to be so small that they
</p>
<p>will be neglected here for simplicity.
</p>
<p>The four unpaired electrons on the rectangle occupy the magnetic orbitals a, b, c
</p>
<p>and d, respectively. They can be coupled to a quintet, three different triplets and two
</p>
<p>singlets. A common basis for these six states is given by the sixMS = 0 determinants
|abcd|, |abcd|, |abcd|, |abcd|, |abcd| and |abcd|. In the following, we will omit

<p>3.4.3 Anisotropic Exchange
</p>
<p>In Sect. 3.2 we have introduced the general expression (Eq.3.20) to describe the
</p>
<p>interaction between two spin moments on different magnetic centers. So far, only
</p>
<p>the isotropic interactions have been considered in this chapter; the total spin moment
</p>
<p>(and the single-ion spin) in itself has nopreferredorientation in space, only the relative
</p>
<p>orientation&mdash;parallel or antiparallel&mdash;of the local spins has been looked at. This is
</p>
<p>of course only part of the story. Due to relativistic effects, in many systems the spin
</p>
<p>moment is anisotropic as seen in the previous chapter for mononuclear complexes.
</p>
<p>The magnetic anisotropy is in some compounds accompanied by ferroelectricity.
</p>
<p>These so-called multiferroic compounds, often perovskite transition metal oxides,
</p>
<p>have potential applications as switches, sensors or memory devices. Coming back to
</p>
<p>Eq.3.20, we will separate isotropic and anisotropic interactions before orienting the
</p>
<p>molecule in such a way that the magnetic frame coincides with the cartesian axes
</p>
<p>frame. Then, the Hamiltonian becomes
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;J Ŝ1 &middot; Ŝ2 + Ŝ1AŜ2 (3.90)
</p>
<p>As long as we are concerned with binuclear S = 1/2 complexes, no single-ion
anisotropy has to be added and this Hamiltonian describes the lowest energy levels
</p>
<p>in the absence of an external magnetic field.
</p>
<p>Symmetric anisotropy: The basis of this Hamiltonian can no longer be restricted to
</p>
<p>determinants with the same MS value as was done for the isotropic interactions. The
</p>
<p>inclusion of magnetic anisotropy in the model causes the removal of the degeneracy
</p>
<p>of the different MS levels and eventually mixing of the wave functions with different
</p>
<p>spinmoment.Here,we have to consider fourCSFs; the three components of the triplet
</p>
<p>plus the singlet. To facilitate the determination of the matrix elements of the model</p>

<p>Hamiltonian, it is common practice to consider the basis of uncoupled determinants
</p>
<p>and then transform to the basis of spin-adapted CSFs.
</p>
<p>3.12 Perform the matrix multiplication of the anisotropic term in the model
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>The uncoupled basis is formed by the determinants |αα|, |αβ|, |βα| and |ββ|.
The result of acting with the isotropic part of Hamiltonian on these determinants can
</p>
<p>directly be written down with the help of Eqs. 3.79, but the anisotropic part requires a
</p>
<p>little more work. Based on the relations given in Eqs. 1.16a and 1.20a, the following

<p>Show that the Hamiltonian of Eq.3.90 is hermitian. Assume a diagonal D-
</p>
<p>tensor and show that the triplet part of the matrix is related to the D-tensor of
</p>
<p>an S = 1 mononuclear complex (Eq.2.21) by a factor of 1
2
. Hint: the trace of
</p>
<p>the two matrices can be adjusted to simplify the comparison.
</p>
<p>The construction of a numerical effective Hamiltonian from accurate electronic
</p>
<p>structure calculations permits us to determine the complete D-tensor and therewith
</p>
<p>the orientation of the magnetic axes frame of the system with its easy axis or easy
</p>
<p>plane, depending on the relative energies of the different MS components of the
</p>
<p>triplet. When the magnetic axes frame coincides with the cartesian axes frame, D is
</p>
<p>diagonal and the energy levels of the triplet can be describedwith two parameters; the
</p>
<p>axial anisotropy D and the rhombic anisotropy E as defined in Eq.2.16. Hence, the
</p>
<p>symmetric anisotropic interactionof the S = 1/2 spinmoments,whichby themselves
are isotropic by definition,makes that the total spinmoment of the system is no longer
</p>
<p>fully isotropic.
</p>
<p>Anti-symmetric anisotropy: The second ingredient of the anisotropic interaction is
</p>
<p>the asymmetric part, also known as theDzyaloshinskii&ndash;Moriya (DM) interaction. It is
</p>
<p>held responsible for the appearance of ferromagnetism in antiferromagnetically cou-
</p>
<p>pled Cu2+ systems.Whereas the isotropic and symmetric anisotropic interactions do
not affect the collinearity of the two local magnetic axes frames, the anti-symmetric
</p>
<p>interaction makes that the principal axis of the local moments are no longer paral-
</p>
<p>lel. In a pictorial description of the effect, shown in Fig. 3.15, the cancellation of
</p>
<p>antiferromagnetically coupled spin moments is no longer complete and a (small)
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic moment appears.
</p>
<p>A rigorous description of the anti-symmetric interaction is obtained by including
</p>
<p>the di j in thematrix elements among the four determinants that span themodel space.</p>

<p>The triplet block and the diagonal elements are exactly the same as in the Hamil-
</p>
<p>tonian that only considers the symmetric part of the anisotropic interaction. The
</p>
<p>anti-symmetric interaction introduces non-zero matrix elements for the coupling
</p>
<p>between singlet and triplet and causes a mixing between both spin states. The total
</p>
<p>spin quantum number is (at least formally) no longer a good quantum number. The
</p>
<p>number of parameters is now larger than the number of energy differences, evenwhen
</p>
<p>the system is oriented in the coordinate frame that diagonalizes D. Therefore, a com-
</p>
<p>plete determination of the six parameters&mdash;J , D, E , dxy , dxz and dyz&mdash;necessarily
</p>
<p>goes through the construction of a numerical effective Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>To close this section, we rewrite the Hamiltonian in the form that is most often
</p>
<p>used in the literature. The A-tensor in Eq.3.90 is separated in a symmetric and anti-
</p>
<p>symmetric part.
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;J Ŝ1 &middot; Ŝ2 + Ŝ1DŜ2 + Ŝ1d Ŝ2 (3.95)
</p>
<p>where D is diagonal if the orientation is chosen conveniently, and d always has the
</p>
<p>following structure
</p>
<p>d =
</p>
<p>⎛
⎝
</p>
<p>0 d12 &minus;d13
&minus;d12 0 d23
d13 &minus;d23 0
</p>
<p>⎞
⎠ (3.96)
</p>
<p>This suggest that a shorter notation can be used by writing d as a pseudovector
</p>
<p>d = (dx , dy, dz) with dx = d23; dy = &minus;d13 and dz = d12. The Hamiltonian then
reads
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;J Ŝ1 &middot; Ŝ2 + Ŝ1DŜ2 + dŜ1 &times; Ŝ2 (3.97)
</p>
<p>Now, it also becomes clear that the DM interaction can only be non-zero when the
</p>
<p>local principal magnetic axis are not parallel. The situation becomes slightly more</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.4 Complex Interactions 101
</p>
<p>complicated when magnetic centers are considered with more than one unpaired
</p>
<p>electron. Then the single-ion anisotropy discussed in Chap.2 has to be included in
</p>
<p>the model
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;J Ŝ1 &middot; Ŝ2 + Ŝ1D1 Ŝ1 + Ŝ2D2 Ŝ2 + Ŝ1D12 Ŝ2 + dŜ1 &times; Ŝ2 (3.98)
</p>
<p>and it has been shown that even biquadratic anisotropic interactions can play an
</p>
<p>important role in the description of the low-energy physics of the complex [21]. The
</p>
<p>corresponding operator is
</p>
<p>κ̂ = (Ŝ1 Ŝ1)Daabb(Ŝ2 Ŝ2) (3.99)
</p>
<p>where Daabb is tensor of rank 4 with 81 (3
4) parameters. However by choosing the
</p>
<p>proper magnetic axes frame this number is strongly reduced and when the system has
</p>
<p>a certain degree of symmetry one can eventually characterize the tensorwith notmore
</p>
<p>than nine parameters. Again one can resort to the numerical effective Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>to determine these parameters.

<p>Chapter 4
</p>
<p>From Orbital Models to Accurate Predictions
</p>
<p>Abstract Basic understanding and qualitative prediction of the isotropic magnetic
coupling between two magnetic centers can be obtained with two well-established
valence-only models. This chapter discusses the Kahn&ndash;Briat and Hay&ndash;Thibeault&ndash;
Hoffmann models, which have been (and still are) of fundamental importance for
understanding the basics of magnetism in polynuclear transition metal complexes.
After shortly presenting the basicmodel formagnetism in organic radicals, we review
themost evidentmagnetostructural relations and thenmove to the accurate prediction
of the magnetic coupling. An overview of the most widely used quantum chemical
methods is given, including wave function based methods and approaches within the
spin-unrestricted setting such as density functional theory. The last part of the chapter
is dedicated to the calculation of the interactions beyond the isotropic magnetic
coupling.
</p>
<p>4.1 Qualitative Valence-Only Models
</p>
<p>The simplest electronic structure models for magnetic interactions only consider the
unpaired electrons and their orbitals. All other electrons are taken as inactive and not
included in the description. This leads to very simple wave functions, especially in
the case of two identical S = 12 magnetic centers. Such valence-only models, where
valence is not used in its usual chemical context, are numerically not competitivewith
large-scale all-electron calculations, but have provided chemists and other scientists
working in the field with important insights to control the magnetic interactions in
transition metal complexes and materials with organic radicals.
</p>
<p>4.1.1 The Kahn&ndash;Briat Model
</p>
<p>Based on valence bond reasoning with nonorthogonal atomic-like orbitals, Kahn and
Briat derived an elegant model that is capable of explaining and predicting magnetic
behavior of transition metal complexes based on the shape of the localized magnetic

and S opposite in sign to β, the energy difference between singlet and triplet can be

between the electrons on both magnetic sites is dominant in case of negligible or
zero overlap, for example due to different symmetries of the orbitals a and b. This
favors a ferromagnetic alignment of the spin moments, while a large overlap between
the magnetic orbitals favors the singlet, and hence, enhances the antiferromagnetic
character of the coupling.

</p>
<p>4.1.2 The Hay&ndash;Thibeault&ndash;Hoffmann Model
</p>
<p>The second valence-only model starts from a molecular orbital viewpoint and was
derived in the mid 1970s by Hay, Thibeault and Hoffmann (HTH) [2], approximately
at the same time as the Kahn&ndash;Briat model. Themagnetic orbitals are defined as linear
combinations of orthogonal atomic-like orbitals

(ψa + ψb) φ2 =
</p>
<p>1&radic;
2
(ψa &minus; ψb) (4.11)
</p>
<p>Similar to φa and φb of the Kahn&ndash;Briat model, the atomic-like orbitals of the HTH
model have the largest amplitudes on the magnetic centers, but in contrastψa andψb
show delocalization tails on the ligands to ensure the orthogonality between them.
Therefore, in generalψa andψb are slightlymore delocalized than the nonorthogonal
φa and φb.
</p>
<p>In the original derivation, three determinants were constructed with the molecular
orbitals φ1 and φ2
</p>
<p>T = |φ1φ2| S1 = |φ1φ1| S2 = |φ2φ2| (4.12)

</p>
<p>r12
|φ2φ2〉 = 2h2 + J22
</p>
<p>S1 and S2 have the same spin and spatial symmetry and to obtain the energy of the
lowest singlet a 2&times;2 matrix has to be diagonalized with ES1 and ES2 on the diagonal
and the interaction between the two determinants as off-diagonal element

can be obtained from the outcomes of one single restricted Hartree&ndash;Fock (RHF)
calculation for the triplet state. Furthermore, by expressing the integrals using the

<p>4.1.3 McConnell&rsquo;s Model
</p>
<p>The valence-only models discussed so far have been developed in the field of tran-
sition metal compounds, either molecular based or in extended systems. The domi-
nant magnetic interactions in these systems typically involve atoms that are bonded
through bridging diamagnetic ligands, the so-called through-bond interactions. In
magnetic materials based on organic radicals the mechanism is fundamentally dif-
ferent; there is no diamagnetic bridge between the magnetic centers and the descrip-
tion of the interaction given in Sect. 3.1 (and further analyzed in Chap.5) does not</p>

</p>
<p>directly apply. Traditionally the magnetism caused by through-space interactions in
such organic materials is rationalized with the McConnell I model [3]. To describe
the interaction between two radicals, the model takes an atomic viewpoint and starts
with the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in the following form
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;
&sum;
</p>
<p>i&lt;j
</p>
<p>JijŜiŜj (4.24)
</p>
<p>where the sum runs over all the atoms in the two radicals. The Jij parameters can be
interpreted as the parameter for the coupling of an electron in atomic orbital φi on site
i and another electron in φj on site j. In a valence bond setting with non-orthogonal
orbitals, the interaction can be written as the sum of a positive two-electron exchange
integral and a one-electron integral
</p>
<p>Jij = 〈φiφj|
1
</p>
<p>r12
|φjφi〉 + 〈φi|φj〉〈φi|ĥ(1)|φj〉 (4.25)
</p>
<p>The one-electron integral is dominated by the electron-nucleus attraction in most
cases, and hence, negative in sign. From this it is concluded that, unless the overlap
between the orbitals φi and φj is very small, the Jij parameter is negative, favoring
singlet coupling of the electrons. This expression is not very easy to handle and in
all practical applications to rationalize the magnetic properties of radicals a series of
simplifications is introduced. In the first place the summation is restricted to pairs of
electrons on different units
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;
&sum;
</p>
<p>i&isin;A
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>j&isin;B
JijŜiŜj (4.26)
</p>
<p>assuming that the interactions within a unit do not depend on the coupling of the total
spin moment of the two radicals. The second and most fundamental approximation
of McConnell&rsquo;s model is made by replacing the spin operators by a product of the
total spin operator for each unit and the atomic spin populations ρi
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;ŜA &middot; ŜB
&sum;
</p>
<p>i&isin;A
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>j&isin;B
Jijρiρj (4.27)
</p>
<p>The third simplification lies in the restriction of the sum over i and j to the shortest
contacts only. Thus, second nearest neighbour interactions (and beyond) between the
units, which in many cases oppose the nearest neighbour interactions, are neglected.
These simplifications lead to a very simple model to rationalize or predict magnetic
properties of molecular crystals based on organic radicals. When regions of opposite
spin densities overlap, ρiρj &lt; 0 one can expect ferromagnetic interactions and when
close contacts have spin populations with the same sign, ρiρj &gt; 0, antiferromag-
netism prevails. To illustrate its application, we consider two stacked benzyl radicals
with the CH2 groups in para and meta as illustrated in Fig. 4.1. The spin populations</p>

stacked with the CH2 group in para (middle) and meta position (right)
</p>
<p>shown in the left part of the figure have been calculated with a simple CASSCF
calculation on the doublet spin state of the monomer, although in this case the alter-
nation of the sign of the spin population can be anticipated. The closest contacts
in the stacked dimers are formed by the aligned carbon atoms of the benzene ring.
The ρiρj products for these atoms are all negative in the case of the para conformer
(middle of Fig. 4.1) and therefore this dimer is expected to have a triplet ground state.
The aligned carbon atoms of the meta conformer (right) have spin populations of
the same sign, the ρiρj product is therefore positive, predicting an antiferromagnetic
(singlet) ground state.
</p>
<p>The conclusions on the nature of the ground state in the benzyl dimer extracted
from the model ofMcConnell are in line with those of accurate ab initio calculations.
Also inmany organicmagneticmaterials, themodel has proven its ability to correctly
reproduce the dominant magnetic interactions. However, the careful step-by-step
analysis of the model by Novoa and co-workers [4, 5] showed that the success of
the model is at least partially due to a fortunate cancellation of errors. The analysis
shows that there is no firm theoretical foundation for replacing the spin operators
by atomic spin densities. Moreover, the model was shown to fail to predict the
dominant magnetic interactions in several crystals with nitronyl nitroxide radicals
and cannot reproduce the angle dependence of the magnetic interaction in the model
system containing two H2NO radicals. Hence, despite its numerous successes and
versatility, the McConnell model should be applied with caution.
</p>

state of the benzyl dimer with the CH2 groups in ortho and for the conformer

</p>
<p>4.2 Magnetostructural Correlations
</p>
<p>From the very beginning of the study of the magnetic interactions in transition metal
complexes a large part of the effort has been dedicated to derive relations between the
geometrical structure of the complex and the nature andmagnitude of the coupling of
the localized spin moments. These magnetostructural correlations can be extremely
useful to rationalize the variations in the magnetic behaviour of a family of similar
complexes or to design newcomplexeswith the desired properties.Magnetostructural
relations can be extracted from experimental studies by comparing a large group of
compounds and relate geometric parameters with the observed magnetic behaviour.
This requires a large set of data, but it is often difficult to separate different (opposing)
effects. On the other hand, theoretical studies can take a (model) complex andmodify
the geometry at will to establish the influence of a certain geometric parameter on the
magnetic interaction. Combined with the qualitative valence-only models discussed
in the previous sections one can boil down the complicated magnetic behaviour
to very simple concepts and straightforward magnetostructural correlations. These
concepts and correlations can yield design rules that can be utilized in the synthesis
of materials with pre-defined magnetic properties.
</p>
<p>M&ndash;L&ndash;M angle: One of the most famous magnetostructural correlations concerns
the dependence of J on the M&ndash;L&ndash;M angle in transition metal complexes with a
double bridge as depicted in Fig. 3.1. For angles close to 90◦ the coupling of the spin
moments on the metal ions is ferromagnetic and for larger (and smaller) angles the
coupling becomes antiferromagnetic. The curve shown inFig. 4.2 is a typical example
of this correlation and was obtained by calculating J from the singlet-triplet energy
difference (see Eq.3.29) using the wave functions discussed in Sect. 3.1, Eqs. 3.2a
and 3.7. The change from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic interaction can be
explained with the Hay&ndash;Thibeault&ndash;Hoffmann model. The largest contributions to

</p>
<p>Fig. 4.3 Molecular orbital
diagram showing the
interaction of the plus and
minus combinations of the
3dxy orbitals on the metal
centers with the px and py
orbitals on the ligands
</p>
<p>the magnetic orbitals arise from the plus and minus combinations of the Cu-3dxy
orbitals, shown on the left in Fig. 4.3. The plus and minus combinations of the px and
py orbitals on the bridge in the right column of theMO diagram interact with the 3dxy
orbitals to form bonding and antibonding combinations as shown in the middle of the
figure. The bonding orbitals are doubly occupied and not relevant for the magnetic
properties, but the antibonding combinations correspond to the magnetic orbitals,
in which we readily recognize the large contribution from the 3dxy orbitals with
non-negligible tails on the ligand. In the reasoning of the HTHmodel, the difference
in orbital energy ε of the two magnetic orbitals is directly related to the magnetic
coupling strength, cf. Eq. 4.21 and numerically proven by Ruiz and co-workers in
Ref. [6]. For (nearly) degenerate magnetic orbitals (ε1 &asymp; ε2) the antiferromagnetic
term is small and the direct exchange Kab dominates. However, when the orbital
energies are sufficiently different, the antiferromagnetic term is the largest term and
J will become negative.
</p>
<p>The upper part of Fig. 4.4 shows that the interaction of the px and py bridge
orbitals with the 3dxy orbitals on the metal is approximately equal around α = 90◦.
Therefore, the near degeneracy of the plus and minus combination of the 3d orbitals
is maintained and one can expect a small ferromagnetic interaction of the spins. On
the contrary, for larger angles, the interaction along the x-direction becomes stronger
than for the y orbitals. This is reflected in a larger delocalization onto the ligand
in the gerade orbital than in the ungerade orbital,1 see the lower part of Fig. 4.4.
The energies of the two magnetic orbitals are no longer similar and a considerable
antiferromagnetic contribution exists, which for large enough angles overcomes the
ferromagnetic contribution and turns the net coupling in an antiferromagnetic one.
</p>
<p>Out-of plane angle: A second interesting magnetostructural relation that can easily
be explained with the HTHmodel is the increase in ferromagnetic coupling when the
side group of the bridging atoms is rotated out of the M&ndash;(L)2&ndash;M plane. This relation
was described in detail in Ref. [6] and it was found that ferromagnetic coupling can
be obtained even in thosemolecules that have a rather largeM&ndash;L&ndash;Mangle. Figure4.5
</p>
<p>1Gerade and ungerade (odd and even in German) make reference to the effect of the sign of the
orbital under the action of the inversion operator. The gerade orbital does not change sign, while
the ungerade orbital is converted to its opposite.</p>

4.5 meV but the ferromagnetic regime is not reached. Considering a slightly smaller
M&ndash;L&ndash;M angle (circles), a similar change in the coupling is observed but now the
behaviour is changed from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic near τ = 30◦.
</p>
<p>The increased ferromagnetic character of the coupling upon the out-of-plane
movement of the side group of the bridging ligand (in this simple case a hydro-
gen atom, but the same tendency is observed for bigger residues) is easily explained
with theMOdiagram represented in Fig. 4.3. In the case of a completely flatmagnetic
core, that is τ = 0◦, the ligand orbital in the xy-plane oriented along the y-axis (φ1) is
typically composed of sp hybrids, mixtures of s and py orbitals. When τ is different
from zero, the xy-plane is no longer a symmetry plane of the complex and the pz
orbitals can also contribute to φ1. This means that the hybridization is no longer
purely sp, but has also some sp2 character. The increased p-character of the hybrid
increases the ligand orbital energy and reduces the gap with the 3dxy orbitals in the
left of Fig. 4.3. Consequently, the interaction becomes stronger and the antibonding
combination, the magnetic orbital with energy ε2, will be higher in energy. This
reduces (ε1 &minus; ε2)2 and weakens the antiferromagnetic contribution to the coupling.</p>

<p>Exchange pathways: We will now further expand the relation between geometry
and magnetic coupling strength by exploiting the concept of the exchange pathway,
which was already briefly mentioned at the end of Sect. 4.1.1. For systems with more
than one unpaired electron per magnetic center the Kahn&ndash;Briat model decomposes
the total coupling in pairwise contributions as given in Eq. 4.10. These exchange
pathways provide a very powerful tool to predict the nature of the magnetic coupling
(ferro- or antiferromagnetic; weak, strong) in nearly all combinations of dn magnetic
ions. Many examples were discussed in the book by Kahn [7] and the concept has
recently been reviewed by Launay and Verdaguer [8]. Here we will shortly discuss
two examples to clarify the way of reasoning to rationalize or predict the nature of the
coupling between two transition metals bridged by one or more diamagnetic ligands.
For a full account on this subject we refer to the books of Kahn, and Launay and
Verdaguer.
</p>
<p>The first step in the procedure consist of an inspection of the coordination sphere
of the magnetic centers to determine the shape and symmetry of the optimal local
magnetic orbitals. This can either be done through calculation or by ligand field
reasoning. Our first example is a binuclear complex of Cu2+ and V4+ with a double
alkoxo-bridge. The copper ion has a d9 electronic configuration. This means that all
3d-orbitals are doubly occupied except the 3dxy orbital, which is highest in energy
because it directly points to the atoms of the first coordination sphere. The vanadium
ion is covalently bound to the apex oxygen and the resulting vanadyl group has a
formal oxidation state of VO(II) with one unpaired electron in the orbital of lowest
energy, the largely non-bondingV-3dx2&minus;y2 orbital. Figure4.6 shows the twomagnetic
orbitals of the twomagnetic centers, the left panel corresponds to themagnetic orbital
on Cu and the right panel to the VO site. The superposition of these two pictures in
the middle defines the exchange pathway and can help us to decide upon the overlap
between the two orbitals as they appear in the main equation of the Kahn&ndash;Briat
model, see Eq.4.9. Note, that this does not define a molecular orbital, it is merely
a construction by superimposing the two magnetic orbitals. The product of the two
functions is an odd function with respect to the xz-plane, and hence, integrating over
the cartesian coordinates gives a zerooverlap integralS of these twomagnetic orbitals.
When S is equal or close to zero, the first term in the Kahn&ndash;Briat equation determines</p>

expected to be ferromagnetic, in line with the triplet ground state and singlet-triplet
gap of approximately 100cm&minus;1 observed experimentally [9].
</p>
<p>In complexes with more than one unpaired electron on at least one of the magnetic
sites, the overall magnetic coupling is the sum of the couplings along all exchange
paths weighted by the product of the number of unpaired electrons on each magnetic
center (the number of paths). To illustrate the potential of the Kahn&ndash;Briat model for
predicting the nature of the magnetic coupling, we will focus on the trinuclear CuII
</p>
<p>complex schematically depicted in the upper part of Fig. 4.7 and discuss the effect of
replacing the copper ion in the middle by other transition metals. The complex has
approximate C2v symmetry and the five 3d orbitals belong to the a1 (2x), a2, b1 and
b2 irreducible representations as shown in the lower part of the figure. The copper
ions on the left and right sides of the complex with their 3d9 electronic configuration
have only one unpaired electron, which resides in the 3dxy orbital of a2 symmetry.
When the magnetic center in the middle is also occupied by a Cu2+ ion, the three
magnetic orbitals are all of the same symmetry and hence there is a non-zero overlap
leading to an antiferromagnetic coupling between the TM ions in the complex, in
line with experiment [10].
</p>
<p>Keeping track of the relative energy of the five 3d orbitals (see Fig. 4.7), we now
consider the complexes that contain transition metals with other electronic configu-
rations. Starting with the 3d1 configuration (for example, Ti3+), the natural magnetic
orbital in the middle is 3dz2 with a1 symmetry and the Cu orbitals on the outside are
3dxy of a2 symmetry. Hence, the exchange path includes orthogonal orbitals and fer-
romagnetic interactions are expected. Putting a transition metal with two d-electrons
in the middle leads to an electronic configuration with the unpaired electrons in the</p>

</p>
<p>3dz2 and 3dyz orbitals belonging to the a1 and b2 irreducible representations, respec-
tively. The total coupling is a sum of four exchange paths, which appear in two pairs
because of the left&ndash;right symmetry of the complex. Exchange path type 1 goes from
the 3dz2 orbital in the middle to the 3dxy orbital on the Cu. Since they transform
differently under the symmetry operations of the C2v group, the overlap integral of
the two orbitals is zero and this path contributes in a ferromagnetic way to the cou-
pling. The same holds for the second pair of exchange paths involving the 3dyz and
3dxy orbitals. Hence, again a ferromagnetic coupling can be anticipated. The situ-
ation changes when the middle position is occupied by an ion with a d5 electronic
configuration. Five different exchange paths are now active; four of them involve
orthogonal orbitals, but the fifth connects the 3dxy natural magnetic orbitals of the
centers. The latter gives an antiferromagnetic contribution and counterbalances the
four weaker ferromagnetic exchange paths. When TM ions are placed in the cen-
ter with more than 5 d-electrons, the ferromagnetic exchange paths disappear, the
coupling gets gradually more antiferromagnetic until we arrive again at the strong
antiferromagnetic coupling in the case of three ionswith d9 electronic configurations.
</p>
<p>4.4 Consider the complex sketched in this box and predict the nature of the
coupling when site A is occupied by Ni2+ and site B by Cr3+. The out of plane
TM-ligand distances are larger than the in-plane distances.
</p>
<p>What is the number of exchange paths when Cr3+ is replaced by Mn2+? What
coupling can be expeced?
</p>
<p>Counter-complementarity: Another relation between structure and magnetic cou-
pling strength is covered by the concept of counter-complementarity. In systems
with two magnetic centers connected by two different ligands the total magnetic
coupling is in general not equal to the sum of the magnetic coupling via the two indi-
vidual bridges but often significantly smaller. This anti-synergistic effect can most
efficiently be explained for a system with two S = 1/2 spin moments based on two
molecular orbital diagrams using the HTH model. Figure4.8 shows the interaction
of the atomic-like orbitals on the magnetic centers A and B with those of the bridge
(L1) that is expected to give the largest contribution to the coupling. The molecule is
in the xy-plane and the A&ndash;B &lsquo;bond&rsquo; is along the x-axis. The interaction of the L1&minus;px
orbital with the gerade combination of dxy orbitals is stronger than the interaction
of the L1 &minus; 2py with the ungerade dxy orbitals. Therefore a gap is opened between
the magnetic orbitals ϕ1 and ϕ2 with the antibonding combination of gerade dxy
and L1 &minus; 2px at higher energy. Equation4.21 shows that this gap (∆1) is directly
proportional to the magnetic coupling through L1.</p>

<p>The next step takes into account the interaction with the second bridge (L2) and is
schematically depicted in Fig. 4.9. For symmetry reasons, ϕ1 interacts with ϕ3, and
ϕ2 with ϕ4. If we take a perturbational point of view, the interaction strength is deter-
mined not only by the energy separation of the levels but also by the interactionmatrix
elements. The shape of the orbitals on the left and the right of the figure strongly
suggest that the matrix elements can be assumed to be nearly the same, and hence,
the final result of the interaction is solely determined by the differences in the orbital
energies. ϕ3 and ϕ4 lie at lower energy than ϕ1 and ϕ2, but the separation between
these two is much smaller than ∆1. From this directly follows that ε(ϕ1) &minus; ε(ϕ3)
is smaller than ε(ϕ2) &minus; ε(ϕ4). Consequently, the destabilization in the antibond-
ing combination of ϕ1 and ϕ3 is larger than for ϕ2 and ϕ4 and leads to a smaller
gap between the magnetic orbitals than after the considering only L1: ∆1 &gt; ∆2.</p>

<p>4.3 Accurate Computational Models
</p>
<p>Although the qualitative models discussed so far are very useful for a basic under-
standing of the magnetic interactions between two spin moments, more quantitative
predictions can only be obtained by going beyond the valence-only description con-
sidered so far. As shown in the previous chapter, themagnetic interaction parameter J
of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can in many cases be related to the energy difference
of electronic states with different spin couplings. Hence, precise theoretical estimates
of the magnetic coupling strengths are intimately related to the correct application
of high-level computational schemes.
</p>
<p>As shown in Sect. 3.1, the basic description of the magnetic coupling problem is
intrinsically multideterminantal and in most cases one needs a multiconfigurational
description for minimally accurate results. Before discussing the different compu-
tational schemes that can be used for quantitative estimates, we want to stress that
a multideterminantal wave function is not necessarily a multiconfigurational wave
function. This is best illustrated for the 2-electrons/2-orbitals case discussed before.
The simplest representation of the triplet state is obtained with a single Slater deter-
minant
</p>
<p>ΦT = |φaφb| (4.28)
</p>
<p>where all the doubly occupied orbitals have been omitted. On the other hand, the
most basic description of the open-shell singlet requires a wave function with two
Slater determinants to fulfill the requirements of the spin symmetry.
</p>
<p>ΦS =
|φaφb| &minus; |φaφb|&radic;
</p>
<p>2
(4.29)
</p>
<p>This multideterminantal wave function only describes one electronic configuration
since the occupation of the orbitals is the same in both determinants and is in general
known as a configuration state function. In this simple monoconfigurational descrip-
tion, the energy of the triplet is lower than the singlet by twice the exchange integral
Kab. A more satisfactory description is obtained with a multiconfigurational singlet
wave function by adding the Slater determinants with two electrons in the same
orbital

multireference (MR), for short&mdash;wave function.
</p>
<p>MR-CISD is one of the most accurate ab initio computational schemes that can
be used to describe the electronic structure of systems with a markedly multirefer-
ence character. Although the ever increasing computing power constantly pushes the
frontiers forward, the applicability of MR-CISD remains limited to small (model)
systems. Moreover, the method suffers from the size-extensivety problem inherent
to any truncated CI method. For these reasons, MR-CISD is hardly ever used in com-
putational studies of molecules with unpaired electrons. There are, however, several
alternative wave function based schemes that can provide very useful information
about themagnetic interactions. In the following sections wewill first discuss the ins-
and-outs of a good reference wave function and introduce the difference dedicated
CI (DDCI) method. Thereafter a short account will be given of two implementa-
tions of MR perturbation theory, and the chapter will be closed with a discussion of
the consequences of lifting the restrictions of the spin symmetry as done in density
functional theory (DFT).
</p>
<p>4.3.1 The Reference Wave Function and Excited Determinants
</p>
<p>An important factor in the accurate prediction of magnetic coupling (and other elec-
tronic structure) parameters is the proper choice of the referencewave function. There
are many possible ways to construct the reference, but the complete active space
(CAS) approach has emerged as one of the most versatile methods. The molecular
orbitals are divided in three groups: the inactive, the active and the virtual orbitals.
The orbitals in the first group are doubly occupied in all the Slater determinants of
the multireference wave function, while the orbitals in the last group remain always
unoccupied. The orbitals in the second class span the active space. The multiconfigu-
rational wave function is generated by distributing Nact electrons&mdash;where Nact is the
total number of electrons minus two times the number of inactive orbitals&mdash;over the
Mact active orbitals. This is schematically outlined in Fig. 4.10. The doubly occupied
or empty Hartree Fock orbitals shown on the left are divided in inactive, active and
virtual orbitals. The multiconfigurational wave function is constructed by making a
linear combination of Slater determinants Φ1, Φ2, etc. that differ by the occupation
of the active orbitals. The CAS procedure generates a MR wave function in which
all possible distributions of the active electrons over the active orbitals are consid-
ered. Although this approach often generates many determinants that are very high
in energy and are not specially important in the final wave function, it has several
important practical and conceptual advantages like the good convergence proper-
ties, size extensivity, orbital invariance, etc. [11]. Moreover, it has the advantage that
selecting the active orbital space (although far from being trivial) is in most cases
easier than making an unbiased selection of the most important configurations.</p>

pied and virtual orbitals from a Hartree&ndash;Fock calculation (left) are divided in three groups (right):
Inactive, active and virtual orbitals. A linear combination of Slater determinants is formed in which
the inactive orbitals are always doubly occupied, the virtual orbitals are always empty and the active
orbitals can be doubly occupied, singly occupied or unoccupied
</p>
<p>4.5 How many determinants with MS = 0 can be generated for the active
space with 4 active orbitals and 4 electrons as shown in Fig. 4.10.
</p>
<p>In virtually all calculations of magnetic interactions or related electronic structure
parameters, the wave function expansion is restricted to singly and doubly excited
determinants with respect to the reference. These determinants are often classified
in eight different groups depending on how many holes/particles are created in the
inactive/virtual orbitals. This can be very useful to decompose the wave function in
smaller contributions and in this way facilitate the analysis of the results. Table4.1
overviews the different classes and lists the labels used in some post Hartree&ndash;Fock
methods that will be described in the remainder of this chapter. In the Table we have
used Êrs to define the excitation operator â

It is rather complicated to give generally applicable formulas for the number of

a systemwith k inactive orbitals, l virtual orbitals and n determinants in the reference
wave function, the number of electrons is even andwe restrict ourselves to theMS = 0
subspace without any further spin or spatial symmetry. The approximate number of
2h-2p replacements is given by the product of the number of ways in which 2 holes
can be created in the inactive orbitals (k2) and the ways in which two particles can be
placed in the virtual orbitals (l2) multiplied with the number of determinants in the</p>

</p>
<p>4.3.2 Difference Dedicated Configuration Interaction
</p>
<p>The majority of the excited determinants belong to the class of the 2h-2p excitations.
This class easily constitutes 90% of the determinants in medium-sized molecules
using basis sets of reasonable quality, and hence, the contribution to the correlation
energy is extremely large. However, including this class of excitations in the con-
figuration interaction expansions has only a small effect on the vertical excitation
energies (that is, the relative energies of the different electronic states at a fixed
geometry). Hence, this differential effect can be neglected in the calculation of the
relative energies of the spin states needed to extract J , the magnetic coupling parame-
ter of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and various other electronic structure parameters.
The elimination of the 2h-2p determinants leads to a drastic shortening of the con-
figuration interaction expansion and widens the field of applicability of variational
wave function based methods. The resulting variant of MRCI is generally known
as the difference dedicated configuration interaction (DDCI) [12], which provides
accurate vertical energy differences but cannot be used to compare total energies at
different geometries.</p>

<p>124 4 From Orbital Models to Accurate Predictions
</p>
<p>4.7 Make a rough estimate of the total number of determinants in the MR-
CISD wave function for a system with 74 electrons, 154 orbitals and a
CAS(2,2)CI reference wave function. Calculate the percentage of 2h-2p exci-
tations in the MR-CISD wave function (neglect the 1h, 1p, 1h-1p, 2h and 2p
excitations, they give rise to a very small number of determinants).
</p>
<p>The justification for eliminating the 2h-2p determinants relies on second-order
perturbation theory in its quasi-degenerate formulation as exposed in Chap.1.
Although it can be done for an arbitrary number of unpaired electrons, we will
elaborate the 2-electrons/2-orbitals case for simplicity. The model space is spanned
by the neutral and ionic determinants
</p>
<p>ΦI = {|hhab|, |hhba|, |hhaa|, |hhbb|} (4.31)
</p>
<p>where h is one of the inactive orbitals, doubly occupied in all determinants of the
model space. The lowest two eigenstates of the model space are the singlet and triplet
spin functionswhose energy difference is related to J . However, before diagonalizing
we will first evaluate the effect of the 2h-2p external determinants on the matrix
elements between the determinants of the model space with QDPT. First, we take
a look at the off-diagonal elements and calculate the second-order contributions of
ΦR = |ppab| and ΦS = |ppba| to the dressed matrix element of ΦI = |hhab| and
ΦJ = |hhba| according to the expression given in Eq.1.86. The 2h-2p determinant
ΦR is obtained by making a double replacement in ΦI , exciting the electrons in
h to the unoccupied orbitals p and ΦS arises from ΦJ in an analogous way. The
contributions to the effective matrix element are
</p>
<p>ΦR:
〈hhab|V̂ |ppab〉〈ppab|V̂ |hhba〉
</p>
<p>EJ &minus; ER
(4.32a)
</p>
<p>ΦS:
〈hhab|V̂ |ppba〉〈ppba|V̂ |hhba〉
</p>
<p>EJ &minus; ES
(4.32b)
</p>
<p>For the contribution of ΦR, the second matrix element in the numerator is zero
because the determinants on the left and the right of the operator have more than
two different columns, and the same occurs for the first matrix element in the ΦS
contribution. This eliminates any second-order perturbation contribution from the
2h-2p determinants to the off-diagonal elements of the model space.
</p>
<p>4.8 Write down the second-order contribution ofΦQ to 〈ΦI |Ĥeff |ΦL〉, where
ΦQ arises from a double excitation from orbital h to orbital p acting on the
ionic determinant ΦL = |hhbb|. Argue that this contribution is equal to zero.</p>

</p>
<p>On the contrary, the diagonal elements do have a contribution from the 2h-2p
excitations. Continuing with the external determinantsΦR andΦS , it is easily shown
that the former only contributes to 〈ΦI |Ĥeff |ΦI 〉 and the latter to 〈ΦJ |Ĥeff |ΦJ〉

</p>
<p>The summation only involves integrals that depend on the inactive (h, h&prime;) and virtual
(p, p&prime;) orbitals, and hence, is exactly the same for all the diagonal elements in the
model space. This uniform shift of the diagonal elements does not affect the energy
differences of the eigenstates of the model space and in combination with the zero
contribution to the off-diagonal elements, this shows that the 2h-2p determinants can
be skipped in the CI expansion of the wave function. Note that this argument is based
on second-order perturbation theory, the inclusion of higher-order interactions gives
rise to small contributions and strictly speaking the mutual interaction between the
2h-2p determinants could affect the energy differences.

<p>circumstances, the list of determinants that do not affect the energy difference of the

<p>The first integral in the numerator of the ΦR contribution is non-zero because the
determinants in the bra and the ket only differ by two columns, but |aapb| differs at
three places from |hhba|, and hence, leads to a zero contribution. The same holds for
ΦS . At first sight, the contribution to the diagonal elements of the model space may
seem non-uniform:
</p>
<p>ΦR:
|〈hhab|V̂ |aapb〉|2
</p>
<p>EI &minus; ER

= 0 |〈hhba|V̂ |aapb〉|

= 0 |〈hhba|V̂ |bbpa〉|
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>EJ &minus; ES

= 0 (4.37b)
</p>
<p>At differencewith the 2h-2pdeterminants discussed above, the twonon-zero integrals
are not necessarily equal in this case. However, the effect of Φ &prime;R = |aabp| and
Φ &prime;S = |bbap| exactly compensates this disequilibrium:
</p>
<p>Φ &prime;R:
|〈hhab|V̂ |aabp〉|2
</p>
<p>EI &minus; E&prime;R
= 0 |〈hhba|V̂ |aabp〉|

</p>
<p>EJ &minus; E&prime;S
= 0 (4.38b)
</p>
<p>The denominators in the non-zero contributions of ΦR and Φ &prime;R are equal since
ER = E&prime;R, and EI = EJ in a degenerate model space. Furthermore, the integral
〈hhab|V̂ |aapb〉 in Eq.4.37a is exactly the same as the integral 〈hhba|V̂ |aabp〉 of
Eq.4.38a

<p>The same reasoning holds forΦS andΦ &prime;S showing that taking into account the 2h-1p
and 1h-2p excitations only causes a uniform shift of the diagonal matrix elements,
and hence, they can be left out of the calculation of the energy difference between
the states of the model space.
</p>
<p>This variant of the difference dedicated CI is commonly known as DDCI2 and
gives reasonable energy differences for systems with a moderate importance of the
ionic determinants. This is specially interesting for the treatment of organic biradicals
or TM complexes with weakly coupled spin moments. However, the DDCI2 energy
difference becomes increasingly more approximate when the CAS reference wave
function contains non-negligible contributions from non-degenerate determinants.
In these cases, one necessarily has to rely on the more expensive DDCI procedure.
Finally, the external space is sometimes even further reduced by eliminating also
the 2h and 2p determinants from the CI. The resulting CAS+S or DDCI1 method
can be used to obtain a first impression of the relative size of the parameters, but
does normally not provide accurate answers. Moreover, one should be aware of
the practical problem that the implementations of this variant in different computer
programs do not consider exactly the same list of determinants.
</p>
<p>4.3.3 Multireference Perturbation Theory
</p>
<p>As an alternative for the variational methods, one can also apply multireference
perturbation theory (MRPT) to calculate magnetic interactions. In principle, this
type of calculations makes it possible to treat larger systems with more unpaired
electrons. Among the many different implementations, two schemes are especially
popular in the field of magnetic interactions: CASPT2 [13] and NEVPT2 [14, 15],
which will be shortly overviewed here.
</p>
<p>The standard M&oslash;ller&ndash;Plesset perturbation theory uses a single determinant refer-
ence wave function and defines the zeroth-order Hamiltonian as the sum of the Fock
operators
</p>
<p>Ĥ
(0)
MP =
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>F̂i (4.40)
</p>
<p>By Koopmans&rsquo; theorem, the eigenvalues of the Fock operator applied on occupied
orbitals are proportional to ionization potentials and the eigenvalues corresponding
to unoccupied orbitals are related to the electron affinities. CASPT2 extends the
applicability to multireference cases by defining an effective one-electron Fock-type
operator as zeroth order Hamiltonian in the following way</p>

<p>Fig. 4.11 Structure of the
f -matrix of Ĥ(0)in CASPT2.
The dark grey blocks have
non-zero values, the white
blocks are zero and the light
grey blocks are zero when
the orbitals are optimized for
the state under study. For
zero active orbitals only the
diagonal elements survive
and the M&oslash;ller&ndash;Plesset
definition of Ĥ(0)emerges
</p>
<p>Ĥ(0) =
&sum;
</p>
<p>rsσ
</p>
<p>frsσ Êrs; with frsσ = &minus;〈0|[[Ĥ, â&dagger;sσ ], ârσ ]+|0〉 (4.41)
</p>
<p>where |0〉 is the CASSCF reference wave function and σ a general index for the spin
coordinates. This definition may appear complicated at first sight, but a closer look
on the f -matrix learns that it is in fact a rather straightforward expression that reduces
to the M&oslash;ller&ndash;Plesset zeroth-order Hamiltonian in the limit of zero active orbitals.
</p>
<p>frs = 〈0|ârĤâ&dagger;s |0〉 &minus; 〈0|â&dagger;s Ĥâr |0〉 &minus; 〈0|âr â&dagger;s Ĥ|0〉 + 〈0|Ĥâ&dagger;s âr |0〉 (4.42)
</p>
<p>The structure of the matrix is schematically presented in Fig. 4.11. The inactive-
virtual block of the matrix is given by
</p>
<p>fhp = 〈0|âhĤâ&dagger;p|0〉 &minus; 〈0|â&dagger;pĤâh|0〉 &minus; 〈0|âhâ&dagger;pĤ|0〉 + 〈0|Ĥâ&dagger;pâh|0〉 = 0 (4.43)
</p>
<p>where the first term is zero by 〈0|âh = â&dagger;h|0〉 = 0, since no particle can be created
in an occupied orbital. The second and third term can be shown to be zero with an
equivalent reasoning, while the fourth term is zero by the extendedBrillouin theorem.
The operator â&dagger;pâh generates a singly excited configuration, which does not interact
with the CASSCF wave function provided optimized orbitals are used. The diagonal
elements of the inactive-inactive block are
</p>
<p>fhh = 〈0|âhĤâ&dagger;h|0〉 &minus; 〈0|â
&dagger;
h
Ĥâh|0〉 &minus; 〈0|âhâ&dagger;hĤ|0〉 + 〈0|Ĥâ
</p>
<p>&dagger;
h
âh|0〉 = &minus;IPh (4.44)
</p>
<p>In this case, the first and third term are again zero for the same reason as exposed
above. However, the operators in the second term annihilate an electron in the bra
and the ket, which result in 〈N &minus; 1|Ĥ|N &minus; 1〉, the energy of the ionized system.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Accurate Computational Models 129
</p>
<p>The operator â&dagger;
h
âh in the fourth term first annihilates an electron in orbital h and
</p>
<p>subsequently creates it again in the same orbital. This leads to 〈0|Ĥ|0〉, the CASSCF
energy of the N-electron system. The off-diagonal terms fhh&prime; are all zero. Finally, we
consider the virtual-virtual diagonal elements of f :
</p>
<p>fpp = 〈0|âpĤâ&dagger;p|0〉 &minus; 〈0|â&dagger;pĤâp|0〉 &minus; 〈0|âpâ&dagger;pĤ|0〉 + 〈0|Ĥâ&dagger;pâp|0〉 = &minus;EAp (4.45)
</p>
<p>The action of âp on |0〉 (annihilation of an electron in an empty orbital) results in
zeros for the second and fourth terms. 〈0|âp and â&dagger;p|0〉 generate an electron in orbital
pmaking the first term equal to the energy of the corresponding (N+1)-electron state.
The third term is the energy of the CASSCF reference, and hence, the diagonal terms
of the virtual-virtual block of f are electron affinities. The off-diagonal elements fpp&prime;
</p>
<p>are zero. Then it is readily seen that the CASPT2 Ĥ(0)reduces to the M&oslash;ller&ndash;Plesset
Hamiltonian in the limit of zero active orbitals.
</p>
<p>It is important to realize that the one-electron nature of Ĥ(0) makes that the expec-
tation values of the excited configurations E(0)R appearing in the denominator of the
corrections to the energy and wave function do not coincide with the expectation
values of the real Hamiltonian Ĥ. In some specific cases, it can happen that E(0)R is
very close to (or even smaller than) the expectation value of the ground state. Such
intruder states may cause a break-down of the perturbation theory. CASPT2 imple-
mentations provide a pragmatic solution to this problem by the so-called level-shift
technique, in which near-degeneracies are removed by adding an extra term to the
denominator.
</p>
<p>Although this approach often resolves the intruder state problem very efficiently,
a methodologically more satisfying route is taken in the n-electron valence state
second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2). By including two-electron interactions
in Ĥ(0), this perturbative scheme does not suffer from the intruder state problem,
except in some pathological cases. The zeroth-order Hamiltonian proposed by Dyall
[16] reads
</p>
<p>Ĥ
(0)
D = Ĥi + Ĥν + C (4.46)
</p>
<p>where Ĥi is of one-electron nature and acts on the inactive and virtual orbitals

</p>
<p>and C is an appropriate constant shift to ensure that Ĥ(0)D is equivalent to the full
Hamiltonian in the active part.
</p>
<p>Contracted versus uncontracted: The simplest way to define the first-order wave
function is to apply single and double excitation operators on all the determinants
(or CSFs) of the reference wave function.
</p>
<p>ψ (1) =
&sum;
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>&sum;
</p>
<p>rstu
</p>
<p>cI,rstuÊrsÊtuΦI (4.49)
</p>
<p>The second-order correction to the energy is relatively straightforward to evaluate,
but the number of terms in the summation rapidly becomes very large, especially for
large reference wave functions. A second approach is to apply excitation operators
not on the individual determinants ofCSFs of the reference space, but on the reference
wave function as a whole.
</p>
<p>ψ (1) =
&sum;
</p>
<p>rstu
</p>
<p>crstuÊrsÊtuψ
(0) (4.50)
</p>
<p>This approach generates much less terms since the external determinants appear
as contracted sums in the first-order wave function. Moreover, the dimension of the
external space does not grow as fast with the size ofψ (1) as in the uncontractedway of
generating ψ (1). On the other hand, the calculation of the second-order correction to
the energy relies on significantlymore complicated expressions but onceprogrammed
this is just a minor issue compared to the limited length of ψ (1).
</p>
<p>The differences between the contracted and uncontracted procedure are best
illustrated by giving two examples with a very simple reference wave function:
ψ (0) = λ|hhaab| + &micro;|hhabb|. In the first place, we will apply the single excitation
operator involving the occupied orbital h and the unoccupied orbitals p and p&prime;. The
uncontracted wave function reads
</p>
<p>ψ (1) = c1|haabp| + c2|haabp| + c3|haabp&prime;| + c4|haabp&prime;|
+ c5|habbp| + c6|habbp| + c7|habbp&prime;| + c8|habbp&prime;| (4.51)
</p>
<p>and in the contracted formalism, the following function is generated
</p>
<p>ψ (1) = c1{λ|haabp| + &micro;|habbp|} + c2{λ|haabp| + &micro;|habbp|}
+ c3{λ|haabp&prime;| + &micro;|habbp&prime;|} + c4{λ|haabp&prime;| + &micro;|habbp&prime;|} (4.52)
</p>
<p>The uncontracted first-order correction has eight different coefficients to be deter-
mined, while the contracted variant generates the same determinants with only four
different coefficients. The fact that the external determinants are weighted by the
coefficients of the reference wave function does only slightly influence the final
result. The second example applies the single excitation operator involving the active
orbitals a and b, and the virtual orbital p. Again, the uncontracted algorithm generates</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Accurate Computational Models 131
</p>
<p>a list of all five possible excited determinants
</p>
<p>ψ (1) = c1|abp| + c2|abp| + c3|aap| + c4|bbp| + c5|abp| (4.53)
</p>
<p>where the hh-part has been omitted for simplicity. The contracted wave function is
shorter:
</p>
<p>ψ (1) = c1{λ|abp| +&micro;|bbp|} + c2λ|abp| + c3{λ|aap| +&micro;|abp|} + c4&micro;|abp| (4.54)
</p>
<p>Since the determinants of the second and fourth term are the same, the wave function
presents a linear dependence, which should be removed and further reduces the
number of coefficients.
</p>
<p>The contraction written in Eq.4.50 is used in CASPT2 and in the partially-
contracted variant of NEVPT2. The latter method is also available in a strongly-
contracted variant of NEVPT2, in which the contracted external functions are
grouped together depending on the number of electrons added or removed from the
active space. In this way a reduced set of orthogonal external functions is generated.
</p>
<p>4.3.4 Spin Unrestricted Methods
</p>
<p>The observation that except for the state of maximummultiplicity, spin states cannot
be rigorously represented with a single determinant makes it very interesting to look
at the possibility to study magnetic interactions in a spin unrestricted setting using
a single determinant description of the spin states. We will start with the spatially
symmetric 2-electron/2-orbital case and afterwards generalize for systems with more
unpaired electrons.
</p>
<p>The most widely applied approximation to extract J within a single determinant
description of the spin states is the so-called Broken Symmetry approach which uses
two determinants:
</p>
<p>ΦBS = |φ1φ2| ΦHS = |φ1φ2| (4.55)
</p>
<p>where the closed-shell orbitals havebeenomitted for convenience.The Ŝ2 expectation
value of ΦHS is not exactly equal to 2 since the closed shell spin orbitals appear in
pairs with slightly different spatial orbitals. However in most cases it is close to 2
and is generally considered as a good approximation to the triplet state obtained in
a spin-restricted setting.
</p>
<p>ΦHS &asymp; ΦT (4.56)
EHS = 〈ΦHS|Ĥ|ΦHS〉 &asymp; ET (4.57)
</p>
<p>〈Ŝ2〉HS = 〈ΦHS|Ŝ2|ΦHS〉 &asymp; 2 (4.58)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>132 4 From Orbital Models to Accurate Predictions
</p>
<p>One the other hand, the Ŝ2 expectation value ofΦBS is neither close to zero (singlet)
nor to two (triplet), but rather somewhere in between. It is therefore a logical step
to approximate the broken symmetry determinant as a linear combination of the
spin-restricted singlet and triplet states [17]:
</p>
<p>|ΦBS〉 = λ|ΦS〉 + &micro;|ΦT 〉 with λ2 + &micro;2 = 1 (4.59)
</p>
<p>with the following energy and Ŝ2 expectation value
</p>
<p>EBS = 〈λΦS + &micro;ΦT |Ĥ|λΦS + &micro;ΦT 〉 = λ2ES + &micro;2ET (4.60)
〈Ŝ2〉BS = λ2〈ΦS|Ŝ2|ΦS〉 + &micro;2〈ΦT |Ŝ2|ΦT 〉 = 2&micro;2 (4.61)
</p>
<p>After substituting &micro;2 = 1 &minus; λ2 from the normalization condition in Eq.4.61, we
obtain
</p>
<p>λ2 = 1&minus; 〈Ŝ
2〉BS
2
</p>
<p>and &micro;2 = 〈Ŝ
2〉BS
2
</p>
<p>(4.62)
</p>
<p>which can be substituted in the energy expression of the BS determinant given in
Eq.4.60
</p>
<p>EBS =
(
</p>
<p>1&minus; 〈Ŝ
2〉BS
2
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>ES +
〈Ŝ2〉BS
</p>
<p>2
ET (4.63)
</p>
<p>The energy difference of the BS and HS determinants now reads
</p>
<p>EBS &minus; EHS = ES &minus;
〈Ŝ2〉BS
</p>
<p>2
(ES &minus; ET )&minus; ET
</p>
<p>=
(

</p>
<p>= 2&minus; 〈Ŝ
2〉BS
</p>
<p>2
(ES &minus; ET ) (4.64)
</p>
<p>which leads to the final expression of the magnetic coupling parameter J as function
of the energies of the spin-unrestricted HS and BS determinants
</p>
<p>J = ES &minus; ET =
2(EBS &minus; EHS)
2&minus; 〈Ŝ2〉BS
</p>
<p>(4.65)
</p>
<p>This is not the only expression used to relate the energy of the two determinants
with the singlet-triplet energy difference. Under the assumption that the spin polar-
ization in the closed shell orbitals is small enough to ensure their orthogonality, one</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Accurate Computational Models 133
</p>
<p>can express the energy difference as function of the overlap of the magnetic orbitals.
From Eq.1.27 we can calculate 〈Ŝ2〉BS
</p>
<p>〈φ1φ2|Ŝ2|φ1φ2〉 = 〈φ1φ2|φ1φ2 + φ1φ2〉 = 〈φ1φ2|φ1φ2 &minus; φ2φ1〉
= 1&minus; 〈φ1|φ2〉2 (4.66)
</p>
<p>The substitution of this expression in Eq.4.65 leads to
</p>
<p>J = ES &minus; ET =
2(EBS &minus; EHS)
1+ 〈φ1|φ2〉2
</p>
<p>(4.67)
</p>
<p>which in the weak overlap limit evolves to
</p>
<p>J = 2(EBS &minus; EHS) (4.68)
</p>
<p>and in the strong overlap limit to
</p>
<p>J = EBS &minus; EHS (4.69)
</p>
<p>Note that in the latter case the overlap 〈φ1|φ2〉 tends to one, which means that φ1
becomes equal to φ2 and ΦBS = |φ1φ1| represents a closed shell singlet state.
</p>
<p>Expression 4.67 can be rewritten in terms of spin densities to avoid the less
generally available overlap of the magnetic orbitals [18]. The simplest way to do this
is to express the non-orthogonal magnetic orbitals φ1 and φ2 in the local orthogonal
orbitals ψ1 and ψ2:
</p>
<p>|ΦBS〉 = |φ1φ2〉 = |(λψ1 + &micro;ψ2)(&micro;ψ1 + λψ2)〉 (4.70)
</p>
<p>with 〈φ1|φ1〉 = 〈φ2|φ2〉 = λ2 + &micro;2 = 1 and 〈φ1|φ2〉 = 2λ&micro;. The α and β spin
densities arise from φ1 and φ2, respectively, and are equal to λ2 and &micro;2 for site 1.
From this the total spin density can be obtained
</p>
<p>ρα1 = λ2

</p>
<p>2λ2 = 1+ ρα&minus;β1
2&micro;2 = 1&minus; ρα&minus;β1
</p>
<p>(4.71)
</p>
<p>Now the relation with 〈φ1|φ2〉 in Eq.4.67 is easily made
</p>
<p>〈φ1|φ2〉2 = 4λ2&micro;2 = (1+ ρα&minus;β1 )(1&minus; ρ

</p>
<p>2 = 1&minus; (ρBS1 )2 (4.72)
</p>
<p>Note that this equation assumes that all the spin density is localized on the magnetic
centers.
</p>
<p>With a slightlymore elaborate derivation one can also handle cases with an impor-
tant delocalization of the spin density onto the ligands [19]. The magnetic orbitals
are written as a linear combination of three nonorthogonal basis functions</p>

<p>with 〈χi|χj〉 
= 0, 〈χi|χi〉 = 1 and λ ≫ &micro;, ν. The basis functions χ1 and χ2 are
centered on the magnetic site 1 and 2, respectively. The other two functions are
ligand orbitals around site 1 (χ3) and site 2 (χ4). Furthermore, it holds that 〈χ1|χ4〉 =
〈χ2|χ3〉 ≪ 〈χ1|χ3〉 = 〈χ2|χ4〉 in a centro-symmetric system. The overlap of the two
magnetic orbitals is
</p>
<p>〈φ1|φ2〉 = 2λ&micro;+ ν2〈χ3|χ4〉 + (λ2 + &micro;2)〈χ1|χ2〉
+ 2λν〈χ1|χ4〉 + 2&micro;ν〈χ1|χ3〉 (4.74)
</p>
<p>Many terms can be neglected in this expression. The termswith&micro;2, ν2 or&micro;ν are small
because these coefficients are much smaller than λ. Being located in different parts of
the complex, the overlap integrals 〈χ1|χ4〉 and 〈χ1|χ2〉 are also expected to be small.
This makes that the overlap of the magnetic orbitals can be roughly approximated
by 2λ&micro;. The spin density on site 1 can be determined using the Mulliken population
reasoning. The contribution due to φ1 and φ2 are
</p>
<p>φ1 contribution: λ

(2λ&micro;〈χ1|χ2〉 + 2λν〈χ1|χ3〉) (4.75)

</p>
<p>2
(2λ&micro;〈χ1|χ2〉 + 2&micro;ν〈χ1|χ4〉) (4.76)
</p>
<p>which reduce to λ2 and &micro;2 if we apply the same approximations as for the overlap
of the magnetic orbitals. The spin density at the magnetic sites for ΦHS and ΦBS are
given by
</p>
<p>ρHS1 = λ2 + &micro;2 ρBS1 = λ2 &minus; &micro;2 (4.77)
</p>
<p>Now it is easily derived that
</p>
<p>(ρHS1 )
2 &minus; (ρBS1 )2 = 4λ2&micro;2 = 〈φ1|φ2〉2 (4.78)
</p>
<p>which can be used to replace the overlap integral in Eq.4.67 with the more generally
available spin populations. This expression is valid for centro-symmetric systems
but improves the previous one by the fact that it is no longer implicit that the spin
density in the HS state is entirely located on the magnetic center.
</p>
<p>The extension of Eq.4.65 to the general case of magnetic coupling between two
centers with more than one unpaired electron is straightforward and follows the same
logics. The spin-unrestricted HS determinant ΦHS is assumed to be a good approxi-

the BS determinant is considered to be a good representation of the singlet (or lowest
spin) state as proposed by Ruiz and co-workers [6, 19, 22]. These authors often
replace the denominator by 2(2S1S2 + S2) with S2 � S1 and S1 + S2 = Smax to
reflect situations with unequal spin moments on the two magnetic centers.

<p>4.3.5 Alternatives to the Broken Symmetry Approach
</p>
<p>The introduction of the broken symmetry determinant as representation of the low-
spin coupled spin state not only provides (computational) chemists with a tool to
calculate magnetic interactions with single determinant methods, it also makes a
connection with the intuitive representations of spins with up- and downwards point-
ing arrows at each magnetic center. However, this representation does not lead to
spin functions that are eigenfunctions of the total spin operator Ŝ2, as expected in a
non-relativistic setting and explained in Chap.1. From this point of view the broken
symmetry approach is less satisfactory and there have been many attempts to design
alternative approaches to calculate magnetic interactions with DFT to improve upon
the shortcomings of the standard approach.
</p>
<p>A natural starting point is to combine a multiconfigurational SCF approach to
treat the static electron correlation3 and DFT for the remaining (mainly dynamic)
electron correlation. It is, however, not easy to design functionals that only take into
account this latter part of the electron correlation and do not consider (part of) the
static correlation. Despite many efforts, there seems no definitive solution to the
double counting problem.
</p>
<p>Restricted ensemble Kohn&ndash;Sham DFT Alternatively one can perform standard
KS-DFT calculations on a collection of determinants with different occupations and
take a weighted average of the individual energies to obtain an estimate of the mul-
tideterminantal situation. To avoid the independent calculation of several KS deter-
minants, a generalization of this approach was proposed by Filatov and Shaik based
on the coupling operator technique developed by Roothaan for restricted open-shell
Hartree&ndash;Fock. This restricted open-shell Kohn&ndash;Sham (ROKS) approach was later
extended to situations where fractional occupation numbers are not imposed by the

</p>
<p>symmetry (as in atomic multiplets or ligand-field states in coordination complexes)
but due to accidental (near-)degeneracies. This extended approach was named the
restricted ensemble Kohn&ndash;Sham (REKS) method [23, 24]. An optimal set of Kohn&ndash;
Sham orbitals and occupation numbers is obtained by a minimization procedure that
always maintains the spin and spatial symmetry of the N-electron state under study.
</p>
<p>The approach has been used to calculate the coupling of two localized spin
moments in binuclear transition metal complexes and the singlet-triplet splitting in
biradical systems, such as twisted ethylene. Rather reasonable values of themagnetic
coupling parameters were obtained. In general, the couplings are slightly too small,
which may be attributed to the lack of spin polarization. An important advantage of
the method is the fact that geometries can be optimized for open-shell singlet states
within the DFT framework.
</p>
<p>Spin-flip time-dependent DFT The energy differences of the spin states involved
in the magnetic interaction of two (or more) spin moments can be seen to some
extent as vertical excitation energies, and hence, time-dependent DFT (or other lin-
ear response methods as equation of motions coupled cluster [25]) could in principle
be used to determine the magnetic interaction between two spin moments. However,
the standard implementation of TD-DFTonly considers single, spin-conserving exci-
tations, which prevents accounting for the multideterminantal character of the states
with low-spin coupling [26]. Figure4.12 shows the five determinants that are essen-
tial to describe the magnetic coupling in a two-electron/two-orbital problem. Using
determinantΦ1,Φ2 orΦ3 as reference will not generate all five determinants in stan-
dard TD-DFT, while Φ4 and Φ5 lead to the same spin contamination problems as
in the BS approach discussed above. The spin-flip formalism (originally developed
in the framework of Hartree&ndash;Fock and coupled cluster, and later implemented for
TD-DFT) offers an interesting solution to this shortcoming. The determinant with
maximumMS-value is taken as reference (Φ1 in Fig. 4.12) and all single excited deter-
minants involving one spin-flip are generated from this. Within the space of the two-
electron/two-orbital problem, this procedure generates the determinants Φ2 . . . Φ5
of Fig. 4.12, and hence, gives access to the energy of the open-shell singlet within
the TD-DFT framework without spin-contamination problems.
</p>
<p>Constrained DFT The basic shortcomings of the BS approach can be summarized
in two points. In the first place, the spin contamination, or the impossibility to rep-
resent the low-spin states with a single Kohn&ndash;Sham determinant. The second point
is the fact that nearly all todays functionals tend to overestimate the delocalization
of the spin density and overestimate the antiferromagnetic character of the coupling.

</p>
<p>Constrained DFT (C-DFT) remedies, at least partially, the latter by putting restric-
tions on the spatial distributions of the α and β electrons [27]. Two fragments p and
q are defined such that both include one magnetic center and the atoms around it.
Subsequently, the density is optimized under the restrictions that Npα &minus; Npβ = M
</p>
<p>p
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>and Nqα &minus; Nqβ = M
q
</p>
<p>S , where N
p,q
α,β are the summed spin populations of the atoms in
</p>
<p>the fragments and Mp,qS the prefixed excess of α or β electrons in each fragment.
C-DFT results in less delocalized spin densities and therefore, in general, to smaller
interaction parameters.

</p>
<p>dimers suggested that ES &minus; ET depends strongly on the Cu&ndash;Cl&ndash;Cu angle θ . She
performs RHF calculations on the triplet state in order to predict ES &minus; ET with the
HTH model. She produces a Table of results, where the gerade and ungerade open
shell orbitals are denoted 1 and 2, respectively.

<p>Compute J (in K) for θ = 85◦ . . . 105◦ using the HTH model. Do you observe a
strong dependence of the coupling on the angle? Can the same conclusions be drawn
when only considering the orbital energies?
</p>
<p>4.2 Quantifying the counter-complementarity effect. Standard optimization of
the molecular orbitals of a magnetic complex with two magnetic centers bridged
by two different ligands normally leads to magnetic orbitals with contributions on
both ligands (as ϕ5 and ϕ6 in Fig. 4.9). This makes it very hard to quantify the
counter-complementary effect of the two ligands. Design a computational strategy
to determine quantitatively the reduction of the magnetic coupling through ligand
1 by the counter-complementary effect of ligand 2. Hint: Many quantum chemical
programs can divide the whole system into fragments.

<p>4.3 Broken symmetry approach. The magnetic coupling of three binuclear TM
complexes has been studied with DFT. The following results were obtained for the
HS and BS determinants. (a) Calculate the magnetic coupling parameter J with the
Yamaguchi equation (Eq.4.85) and compare the outcomes to the alternative relations

<p>Towards a Quantitative Understanding
</p>
<p>Abstract Taking a binuclear copper complex as model system, the isotropic mag-
</p>
<p>netic coupling is decomposed into different contributions. Perturbative expressions
</p>
<p>of the main contributions are derived and illustrated with numerical examples. An
</p>
<p>effective Hamiltonian is constructed that incorporates all important electron corre-
</p>
<p>lation effects and establishes a connection between the complex N -electron wave
</p>
<p>functions and the simpler qualitative methods discussed in the previous chapter.
</p>
<p>Subsequently an outline is given of the analysis of the coupling with a single deter-
</p>
<p>minant approach and the biquadratic and four-center interactions are decomposed.
</p>
<p>The chapter closes with the recently proposed method to extract DFT estimates for
</p>
<p>these complex interactions.
</p>
<p>5.1 Decomposition of the Magnetic Coupling
</p>
<p>The production of accurate electronic structure parameters is of course an important
</p>
<p>result for computational chemistry. However, it should not be the final goal and one
</p>
<p>has to go one step further on the road towards understanding. The qualitative valence
</p>
<p>methods described in the first sections of the previous chapter of this book are mainly
</p>
<p>focused on this understanding of the coupling, but here we discuss three approaches to
</p>
<p>analyse the results of the computational schemes that aim at a quantitative agreement
</p>
<p>with experiment. In this way quantitative accuracy can be combined with qualitative
</p>
<p>understanding.
</p>
<p>The binuclear complex [L2Cu2(&micro;-1,3-N3)2]
2+ (L=N,N&rsquo;,N&rdquo;-trimethyl-1,4,7-
</p>
<p>triaza-cyclononane) shows a large antiferromagnetic coupling with J = &minus;800 cm,
nicely reproduced with a DDCI calculation using a CAS(2,2)SCF reference wave
</p>
<p>function on the model complex [(NH3)6Cu2(&micro;-1,3-N3)2]
2+ [1]. In this section, we
</p>
<p>will closely follow the work of Calzado and co-workers, decompose this 800 cm&minus;1
</p>
<p>into small pieces and ascribe each individual contribution to well defined physical
</p>
<p>mechanisms [2, 3].

</p>
<p>5.1.1 Valence Mechanisms
</p>
<p>First we focus on the mechanisms that arise from interactions among the configu-
</p>
<p>rations in the active space, restricting ourselves to the role played by the two Cu2+
</p>
<p>ions. For this centro-symmetric system, the active orbitals g = (a + b)/
&radic;

<p>2 and

<p>u = (a &minus; b)/

</p>
<p>CAS = {|gg|, |uu|, |gu|, |ug|} (5.1)

three singlets and one triplet

</p>
<p>The energy difference of Sg and Tu defines J but the analysis is much easier in a
</p>
<p>representation with localized orbitals. Therefore, we rewrite the CAS in terms of the

<p>There is, however, also an indirect interaction between the two determinants via the
</p>
<p>ionic determinants |aa| and |bb| as shown in the lower part of the figure. Going
from left to right, in the first step an electron is transferred from orbital a to orbital

<p>b to produce an ionic determinant at energy U with respect to the initial neutral

<p>If we compare this to the matrix element of |ab| and |ab| of the Heisenberg Hamil-
tonian in Eq. 3.34, we obtain the same expression for J as derived from the diago-
</p>
<p>nalization of the CAS given in Eq. 5.8.

Find the other path that connects the two neutral determinants via an ionic
</p>
<p>determinant.
</p>
<p>As long as the variational space is restricted to the metal basis functions, the hop-
</p>
<p>ping parameter tab is extremely small due to the fact that orbitals a and b are strongly
</p>
<p>localized in different regions of space. Therefore, the antiferromagnetic contribution
</p>
<p>to J remains small and new mechanisms have to be introduced to describe the cou-
</p>
<p>pling. An important improvement is obtained when the role of the bridging ligand is
</p>
<p>taken into account as schematically represented in Fig. 5.4. Orbitals a and b are again
</p>
<p>the strongly localized metal orbitals and orbital h is localized on the bridge. In the
</p>
<p>first step, an electron is transferred from the ligand orbital h to site b, immediately
</p>
<p>followed by the movement of the electron on site a to the ligand, which creates the
</p>
<p>ionic determinant |bb|. To arrive at the neutral determinant with inverted spins with
respect to the initial determinant, a beta spin electron is transferred from the ligand
</p>
<p>to site a and the resulting hole is filled by the beta spin electron that resides on cen-
</p>
<p>ter b. This indirect interaction between the two neutral determinants involves three
</p>
<p>determinants outside the model space and hence the importance cannot be estimated
</p>
<p>by second-order QDPT. Instead, one has to apply fourth-order perturbation theory.</p>

volving ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excitations that were shown to play
</p>
<p>an important role in the QDPT analysis of the coupling.
</p>
<p>The results of the CAS calculation are listed in Table 5.1 and show how the kinetic
</p>
<p>exchange strongly dominates over the direct exchange, which is rather small as
</p>
<p>expected from the large distance between the Cu ions. The parameters are directly
</p>
<p>extracted by comparing the numerical values of the CASCI matrix with the symbolic
</p>
<p>representation given in Eq. 5.4. The choice for cm&minus;1 as energy unit leads to big
numbers for U , which is therefore often expressed in eV. The kinetic exchange
</p>
<p>contribution is calculated from t
eff
</p>
<p>ab and U applying Eq. 5.16: (&minus;4 &middot;(&minus;2218)2/20800).
</p>
<p>5.1.2 Beyond the Valence Space
</p>
<p>It is obvious that this cannot be the whole story. The calculated magnetic coupling
</p>
<p>of the Cu2+ complex is just 10 % of the experimental and DDCI values. Hence,
it is unavoidable to go beyond this valence-only description and incorporate more
</p>
<p>physical mechanisms in the description.
</p>
<p>The 1h, 1p, 1h-1p excitations: In the first step towards the full DDCI result, we
</p>
<p>analyze the role of the 1h, 1p and 1h-1p determinants as illustrated in Fig. 5.6. The
</p>
<p>determinants on the left are pure single excitations and those on the right are single
</p>
<p>excitations combined with an excitation within the CAS. Because of the Brillouin
</p>
<p>theorem the contributions of the pure single excitations are strictly zero for the spin
</p>
<p>state for which the orbitals have been optimized and tiny contributions are observed
</p>
<p>for the other spin states given that the optimal orbitals for the different spin states
</p>
<p>are in principle very similar.
</p>
<p>The situation is quite different for the single excitations that are combined with
</p>
<p>electron replacements in the CAS. The 1h-1p excitation in the determinants marked
</p>
<p>as spin polarization not only excites one of the electrons from orbital h to orbital p
</p>
<p>but also changes the spin of the excited electron. These so-called triplet excitations
</p>
<p>have to be compensated by a simultaneous spin change in the active space to maintain
</p>
<p>the spin of the electronic state under consideration. This gives rise to a triplet coupled</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.1 Decomposition of the Magnetic Coupling 149
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.6 Schematic representation of the 1h, 1p and 1h-1p determinants. The left column shows the
</p>
<p>pure single excitations, and the right the single excitations combined with a change in the occupation
</p>
<p>of the active orbitals. h and p are assumed to be ligand orbitals, LMCT = ligand-to-metal charge
transfer, MLCT = metal-to-ligand charge transfer
</p>
<p>electron pair a-b in the active space, from which triplet and singlet spin polarization
</p>
<p>determinants can be formed through the coupling with the h-p triplet coupled electron
</p>
<p>pair. The resulting determinants strongly interact both with Sg and Tu (see Eq. 5.5) via
</p>
<p>the neutral determinants of the reference wave functions, but the matrix element with
</p>
<p>the ionic determinants is zero since there are more than two differences in the orbital
</p>
<p>occupancies. The spin polarization introduces spin density on the ligand, which is
</p>
<p>opposite to the spin density on the metal centers. It can contribute both ferro- and
</p>
<p>antiferromagnetically depending on the structure of the complex, but it is general
</p>
<p>more important when the 1h-1p triplet excitation on the ligand is low in energy, as
</p>
<p>in conjugated bridges.
</p>
<p>5.6 The h-p and the a-b electron pairs are triplet coupled (S= 1) in the de-
terminants that cause spin polarization in the ligands. Which values can be
</p>
<p>assigned to the total spin by coupling the two S= 1 electron pairs? Are all spin
states relevant to the binuclear Cu2+ system under study?
</p>
<p>The second type of important 1h-1p determinants combines a spin-conserving h
</p>
<p>to p excitation with an electron replacement from a to b (or vice versa) in the
</p>
<p>active space. The resulting determinants can be considered as single excitations with
</p>
<p>respect to the ionic determinants, but Brillouin&rsquo;s theorem does not apply because</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>150 5 Towards a Quantitative Understanding
</p>
<p>the orbitals are not optimized for this ionic charge distribution but rather for the
</p>
<p>neutral situation. Hence, there is a strong interaction of these determinants with the
</p>
<p>|aa| and |bb| determinants, while the interaction with the neutral determinants is
much weaker. Since, the ionic determinants are only present in the reference wave
</p>
<p>function of the Sg state, the addition to the wave function of these 1h-1p excitations
</p>
<p>leads to a significant stabilization of the singlet with respect to the triplet state, and
</p>
<p>consequently, an increase of the antiferromagnetic character of the coupling. Adding
</p>
<p>single excitations to a determinant that is not expressed in its optimal orbitals is a
</p>
<p>very efficient way to improve the orbitals. Therefore, this class of 1h-1p excitations
</p>
<p>is often interpreted as relaxing the ionic determinants in the wave function, lowering
</p>
<p>their energy with respect to the neutral determinants, that is, a decrease of U . In line
</p>
<p>with the expression for J given in Eq. 5.16, a smaller U makes the kinetic exchange
</p>
<p>more effective and J more antiferromagnetic.
</p>
<p>The total effect of the single excitations is a large step in the right direction, both
</p>
<p>spin polarization and the relaxation of the ionic determinants cause antiferromagnetic
</p>
<p>contributions, but still the value of the coupling is only &sim;50 % of the final value and
other mechanisms have to be included.
</p>

</p>
<p>ab , calculate the energy lowering effect on U of the inclusion of the 1h-1p
</p>
<p>excitations combined with the electron replacement in the active space using
</p>
<p>the numerical data from Tables 5.1 and 5.2.
</p>
<p>The last step: 2h, 2p, 2h-1p and 1h-2p excitations. The double excitations of the
</p>
<p>2h and 2p class (shown in the left column of Fig. 5.7) only contribute very little to the
</p>
<p>magnetic coupling of the two Cu ions. They correspond to double ligand-to-metal
</p>
<p>or metal-to-ligand charge transfer excitations, respectively. The weak interaction
</p>
<p>is largely explained by the high energy of these determinants with respect to the
</p>
<p>neutral determinants. This energy difference enters the denominator of the pertur-
</p>
<p>bative expression of the effect of the external determinants, and hence, higher-lying
</p>
<p>determinants contribute less to J .

</p>
<p>The single excitation connected to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer process does
</p>
<p>not interact with the reference wave function by Brillouin&rsquo;s theorem. However, the
</p>
<p>combination of a LMCT excitation with a single excitation from occupied to virtual
</p>
<p>orbitals (1h + 1h-1p= 2h-1p) gives rise to a relaxation process similar to the one
described before for the ionic determinants, right column of Fig. 5.7. The addition
</p>
<p>of the relaxed LMCT determinants to the CI wave function has a large impact on the
</p>
<p>singlet-triplet splitting and virtually always favors the antiferromagnetic character
</p>
<p>of the coupling. Analogously, the 1h-2p excitations can be considered to introduce
</p>
<p>the relaxation of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer excitations. The addition of
</p>
<p>these determinants is ferromagnetic in most cases, but usually smaller than the effect
</p>
<p>of the 2h-1p determinants. Hence the net effect of these double excitations is a
</p>
<p>significant increase of the singlet-triplet gap as can be seen in Table 5.2. The 2h and
</p>
<p>2p determinants give a tiny contribution to J , but the inclusion of the 2h-1p and
</p>
<p>1h-2p determinants brings the computational estimate of J in close agreement with
</p>
<p>the experimental value.
</p>
<p>Remember that inclusion of the largest group of determinants that can interact
</p>
<p>with the neutral determinants, the 2h-2p determinants, has a negligible effect on the
</p>
<p>energy difference and is not included in the DDCI wave function and not considered
</p>
<p>in the analysis of the mechanism of the coupling. This will be numerically shown

</p>
<p>as exemplified in Table 4.1. The analysis is completely straightforward, one just has
</p>
<p>to subtract the energy contributions of the different spin states in a class-by-class
</p>
<p>manner to decompose the magnetic coupling. Table 5.3 shows the contribution of the
</p>
<p>different excitation classes in the example compound studied above with DDCI.
</p>
<p>There are two major contributions to the energy difference of singlet and triplet.
</p>
<p>In the first place, the 1h-1p excitations, which cause spin polarization and relaxation
</p>
<p>of the ionic determinants. Unfortunately, it is not possible to separate the two contri-
</p>
<p>butions as in DDCI. The second large contribution arises from the 2h-1p excitations,
</p>
<p>which also enhances the singlet stability, as expected. The 2h and 2p excitations are
</p>
<p>nearly zero and the 1h-2p class also gives a rather small contribution for the present
</p>
<p>system. The total contribution of the 2h-2p class is by far the largest, it constitutes
</p>
<p>approximately 92 % of E (2), but the differential effect is very small. The non-zero
</p>
<p>contribution to the difference may seem surprising given the fact that the justification
</p>
<p>of DDCI is based on the zero contribution of these excitations at second-order per-
</p>
<p>turbation theory. However, this reasoning is based on a common orbital basis for the
</p>
<p>spin states, which is not used in the CASPT2 calculation. It is common practice to
</p>
<p>optimize the orbitals for each spin state separately, contrary to MRCI where normally
</p>
<p>one set of orbitals is used. The use of state-specific orbitals also explains the strictly
</p>
<p>zero contribution of the 1h and 1p excitations for both states.
</p>
<p>5.2 Mapping Back on a Valence-Only Model
</p>
<p>The preceding section shows that a valence-only description of the coupling leads to
</p>
<p>rather poor predictions. Although the sign of the coupling is often (but not always)
</p>
<p>correctly reproduced, it can be stated that the strength of the coupling is underesti-
</p>
<p>mated by at least one order of magnitude. This is in sharp contrast with the success of</p>

<p>5.2 Mapping Back on a Valence-Only Model 153
</p>
<p>the qualitative valence models discussed in Chap. 4, which are capable of explaining
</p>
<p>many magnetostructural correlations and rationalize the relative size of J in large
</p>
<p>families of compounds. These models seem to contain all the essential physics but
</p>
<p>their parametrization with ab initio calculations is deficient. Hence, it may be ad-
</p>
<p>vantageous to construct a simple valence-only picture in which the values of the
</p>
<p>parameters tab, U and Kab are replaced by effective values that absorb all the effects
</p>
<p>discussed above that go beyond the valence-only description. In fact, we have al-
</p>
<p>ready seen how the bare hopping parameter tab was replaced by an effective tab due
</p>
<p>to the partial delocalization of the magnetic orbitals onto the ligands upon the change
</p>
<p>from strongly localized orbitals to self-consistently optimized molecular orbitals as
</p>
<p>schematically illustrated in Fig. 5.8.
</p>
<p>A rigorous way to construct a valence-only model with ab initio methods is to
</p>
<p>make use of the effective Hamiltonian theory presented in Chap. 1. First, we define

<p>the basis of the model space as {|ab|, |ba|, |aa|, |bb|} and use the matrix of Eq. 5.4 to
represent the effective Hamiltonian. Then we replace the bare parameters obtained
</p>
<p>in a valence-only ab initio calculation with effective parameters that include all the
</p>
<p>effects that have been discussed in the previous section. This is done by selecting
</p>
<p>those four roots from the ab initio calculation that have the largest projection on the
</p>
<p>model space. After orthogonalization and normalization, Eq. 1.90 or 1.92 is used to
</p>
<p>construct a numerical Hamiltonian from which the new, effective parameters can be
</p>
<p>extracted by the comparison with Eq. 5.4.
</p>
<p>To numerically illustrate the procedure, we will treat the magnetic coupling of
</p>
<p>two Cu2+ ions in the previously introduced SrCu2O3 compound with Cu2O3 layers
separated by Sr2+ ions (see Sect. 3.4.2). We recall that the copper ions form a regular
pattern that can best be described as a ladder structure as depicted in Fig. 5.9. Among

</p>
<p>Now we apply the Bloch formula (Eq. 1.90) to construct the effective Hamiltonian.
</p>
<p>The resulting parameters are given in the second line of Table 5.4 together with an
</p>
<p>estimate of J from the sum of the direct and kinetic exchange given in Eq. 5.8. As most
</p>
<p>particular results, we see that U is strongly reduced in comparison to the valence-only
</p>
<p>value (CASCI) and that the non-hermiticity is manifest in the two different values
</p>
<p>of the hopping parameter: t1 = 〈ab|Ĥ eff|aa〉 and t2 = 〈aa|Ĥ eff|ab〉.
The Gram&ndash;Schmidt procedure provides a simpler orthogonalization scheme that
</p>
<p>leads to a hermitian effective Hamiltonian. Since Ψ̃ &prime;2 and Ψ̃
&prime;
3 are already orthogonal
</p>
<p>to the other projections, we only have to worry about Ψ̃ &prime;1 and Ψ̃

</p>
<p>Ĥ eff. The parameters extracted with the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalized vectors are
</p>
<p>listed in the third row of the table and reveal besides the expected large decrease of
</p>
<p>U , a negative effective direct exchange and, by construction, a hermitian form with
</p>
<p>only one estimate for t . The estimate of J based on Eq. 5.8 is in excellent agreement
</p>
<p>with the result of the full DDCI calculation.
</p>
<p>The observed changes suffered by the parameters upon dressing them with the ef-
</p>
<p>fects that go beyond the valence space can at least partially be rationalized by looking
</p>
<p>at the interaction of the model space determinants with those in the external space.
</p>
<p>The interaction of the spin-conserving 1h-1p excitations with the neutral determi-
</p>
<p>nants is (nearly) zero due to Brillouin&rsquo;s theorem. On the contrary, the interaction with
</p>
<p>the ionic determinants is strong (see the right part of Fig. 5.10). Hence, this class of
</p>
<p>external determinants largely decreases the on-site repulsion U as previously seen
</p>
<p>in Exercise 6.7 and confirmed here in the example.</p>

<p>act with both neutral determinants:

<p>〈hhab|Ĥ |ha pb〉〈ha pb|Ĥ |hhba〉 �= 0 (5.21)
</p>
<p>and hence, turns the direct exchange parameter Kab = 〈ab|Ĥ |ba〉 into an effec-
tive parameter that parametrizes the direct exchange dressed with spin polarization
</p>
<p>effects. Since this latter effect can be antiferromagnetic in nature, the apparent coun-
</p>
<p>terintuitive situation may arise that K
eff
</p>
<p>ab turns out to be negative, whereas the bare
</p>
<p>Kab is positive by definition.
</p>
<p>Finally, tab is expected to be influenced by the 2h-1p excitations, which can be
</p>
<p>seen as a LMCT excitation (1h) coupled to a single excitation from an occupied to
</p>
<p>a virtual orbital (1h-1p) that relaxes the LMCT configuration. This should lead to
</p>
<p>an increase of the hopping between the magnetic centers. It is, however, difficult
</p>
<p>to isolate the effect of the 2h-1p excitations [4] due to the occurrence of interac-
</p>
<p>tions with other excited determinants and the interference of the 1h-2p excitations.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the hopping parameter t
eff
</p>
<p>ab turns out to be somewhat smaller than the bare
</p>
<p>value. Experience has shown that t does not suffer dramatic changes when electron
</p>
<p>correlation is included in the valence-only models.</p>

</p>
<p>5.3 Analysis with Single Determinant Methods
</p>
<p>The multiconfigurational wave function is a natural starting point for a decompo-
</p>
<p>sition of the magnetic coupling in polynuclear complexes. The relative magnitude
</p>
<p>of the coefficients of the determinants gives a straightforward strategy to analyze
</p>
<p>the importance of the different mechanisms. The disadvantage of this approach is
</p>
<p>of course the rather heavy computational burden, which limits the applicability to
</p>
<p>medium-sized systems. Alternatively, DFT can be used for larger systems but the
</p>
<p>analysis of the results cannot be made in the same way as discussed above, since
</p>
<p>there is only one Slater determinant that contains all the physics. Instead, one can
</p>
<p>decompose the coupling by a series of partial orbital optimizations of the high-spin
</p>
<p>and broken symmetry determinants [5]. The intermediate energy differences can be
</p>
<p>related to the direct and kinetic exchange, and the spin polarization as will be shown
</p>
<p>below.
</p>
<p>The analysis starts with a restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) calculation on
</p>
<p>the HS state. If necessary, the magnetic orbitals are transformed to the representation
</p>
<p>with local orthogonal orbitals a and b, as shown in the first column of Fig. 5.11.
</p>
<p>Staying within the spin-restricted formalism makes that for each α orbital a β orbital
</p>
<p>can be found which has the same spatial part. In the first step, the direct exchange
</p>
<p>is estimated from the energy difference of the HS(ROKS) and a BS determinant in
</p>
<p>which only the spin of one of the unpaired electrons is inverted, but neither the core
</p>
<p>nor the magnetic orbitals are optimized.
</p>
<p>E(BS-ROKS) = E(HS-ROKS)+ Kab (5.22)
</p>
<p>With the help of Yamaguchi&rsquo;s expression (Eq. 4.65), one can define the direct ex-
</p>
<p>change contribution (JDE ) to the total magnetic coupling as
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.11 Schematic representation of the decomposition of the magnetic coupling for computa-
</p>
<p>tional schemes based on a single determinant. The orbitals and electrons marked in red are subject
</p>
<p>to changes with respect to the previous step, the rest is kept frozen</p>

</p>
<p>2 &minus; 1 = 2Kab (5.23)
</p>
<p>Step 2 consists in the optimization of the magnetic orbitals of the BS determinant
</p>
<p>in the fixed field of the doubly occupied orbitals, a so-called frozen core (FC). The
</p>
<p>magnetic orbitals become more delocalized and, more specifically, gain some am-
</p>
<p>plitude on the other magnetic center. This means that the unpaired electrons can
</p>
<p>move from one center to the other and activate the kinetic exchange mechanism. The
</p>
<p>contribution to J is

<p>JK E =

E(BS-FC)&minus; E(HS-ROKS)
</p>
<p>)
</p>
<p>2 &minus; 〈Ŝ2〉BS-FC
&minus; JDE (5.24)
</p>
<p>To a very good approximation, the spatial part of the new magnetic BS orbitals a&prime;
</p>
<p>and b&prime; can be written as a weighted sum of the ROKS orbitals
</p>
<p>a&prime; = (cosα)a + (sin α)b b&prime; = (sin α)a + (cosα)b (5.25)
</p>
<p>5.9 Calculate the overlap of the spatial part of the relaxed magnetic orbitals
</p>
<p>for α = 0, π/60, π/20, π/4, π/2.
</p>
<p>The interaction with the virtual orbitals is very small and can be neglected for the
</p>
<p>present analysis purposes. Substituting these expressions in the BS determinant
</p>
<p>ΦBS = (cosα)2|ab| + (sin α)2|ba| + (sin α cosα)
(
|aa| + |bb|
</p>
<p>)
(5.26)
</p>
<p>shows immediately that the relaxation activates the kinetic exchange by introducing
</p>
<p>the ionic determinants |aa| and |bb| in the BS determinant. The optimization of a
and b makes that the Ŝ2 expectation value of the BS determinant is not exactly one
</p>
<p>as for the BS-ROKS determinant (see Problems).
</p>
<p>The last step relaxes the core orbitals for the HS and BS determinants, keeping
</p>
<p>the magnetic orbitals fixed to what was obtained in step 2 (frozen magnetic orbitals:
</p>
<p>FM). Lifting the restrictions on the spin symmetry in the core orbitals introduces
</p>
<p>different α and β spin orbitals, and hence, accounts for the spin polarization of the
</p>
<p>core electrons in response to the parallel (HS) or antiparallel (BS) unpaired electrons.
</p>
<p>The energy difference between the BS-FM and HS-FM determinants gives access to

</p>
<p>The sum of the three contributions is close to the magnetic coupling constant that
</p>
<p>is obtained in a standard calculation when the Kohn-Sham orbitals are optimized
</p>
<p>without imposing any restriction on the variational process.
</p>
<p>J &asymp; JDE + JK E + JS P (5.28)
</p>
<p>There is no a priori reason to determine the different contributions in this order.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the spin polarization can be calculated before relaxing the magnetic
</p>
<p>orbitals (inverting step 2 and 3) or independently, both taking the orbitals of step 1 as
</p>
<p>starting point. However, the examples given in Ref. [5] show that the order chosen
</p>
<p>here gives the smallest deviation from the fully relaxed energy difference, and hence,
</p>
<p>includes the largest part of the physics.
</p>
<p>5.4 Analysis of Complex Interactions
</p>
<p>The analysis of the interaction between magnetic moments is not restricted to the
</p>
<p>isotropic bilinear exchange of two S = 1/2 centers but can also be applied to systems
with higher spins and more magnetic centers. In this section, we will first decompose
</p>
<p>the magnetic coupling between two Ni2+ (S = 1) ions with a sizeable biquadratic
exchange to pinpoint the origin of the deviations to the standard Heisenberg Hamil-
</p>
<p>tonian. Secondly, we will focus attention on the four-spin cyclic exchange, and finally,
</p>
<p>we will describe how these interactions can be estimated within the DFT framework.
</p>
<p>5.4.1 Decomposition of the Biquadratic Exchange
</p>
<p>One of the central assumptions of the Heisenberg model Hamiltonian is that the local
</p>
<p>spin states are well separated in energy from excited spin states. We will demon-
</p>
<p>strate that non-Heisenberg behavior emerges as soon as this is no longer true. The
</p>
<p>biquadratic exchange is in general a rather small term in the total interaction of the
</p>
<p>spins in polynuclear TM-3d complexes. There are only a few examples where it
</p>
<p>is important to include them for obtaining an accurate description of the lowest-
</p>
<p>energy levels. Returning to the binuclear complexes with a double azido bridge,
</p>
<p>we will here analyze the magnetic coupling of the Ni2+ model complex shown in
Fig. 5.12. The interaction of the spins strongly depends on the δ-angle and ranges from
</p>
<p>approximately 100 cm&minus;1 for δ = 0◦ to nearly zero for δ = 45◦, which is accurately
reproduced with DDCI [6]. More interestingly, the singlet, triplet and quintet DDCI
</p>
<p>energies do not strictly follow the expected Land&eacute; pattern, especially for small δ.
</p>
<p>Deviations up to 3 % are observed and we will use the corresponding wave functions
</p>
<p>to analyze the origin of the deviations to the standard Heisenberg spacing.
</p>
<p>The magnetic orbitals are expressed again in orthogonal atomic-like orbitals,
</p>
<p>denoted ϕ1, ϕ2 for the two magnetic orbitals on site A and ϕ3, ϕ4 for the orbitals on</p>

</p>
<p>symmetric case here considered K12 = K34 ≫ K13 &asymp; K24 &gt; K14 = K23
</p>
<p>In the first place, we recognize that without considering the non-Hund states, there
</p>
<p>is a strict regular order of the singlet, triplet and quintet states. The triplet-quintet
</p>
<p>splitting (2K &prime;) is twice as large as the energy difference between triplet and singlet.
Since this model space only considers the neutral determinants, it is not unexpected
</p>
<p>that the quintet spin coupling leads to the lowest energy. The non-Hund states with
</p>
<p>one local singlet (NH1 and NH2) lie at relative energies of approximately 2K and
</p>
<p>the double non-Hund state is found around 4K with respect to the Q, T, and S states.
</p>
<p>The only non-zero off-diagonal terms in the matrix reveal small interactions be-
</p>
<p>tween T and N H2 and between S and N H3. However, these matrix elements are
</p>
<p>usually very small. The exchange integrals involved are all two-center integrals and
</p>
<p>therefore rather small. Moreover, the different two-center integrals are similar in
</p>
<p>magnitude and tend to cancel each other. Obviously, the quintet state cannot have
</p>
<p>additional contributions from the non-Hund states, since singlet coupling on one of
</p>
<p>the magnetic centers cannot lead to a state with overall quintet coupling. Although
</p>
<p>these interactions are at the very origin of the deviations to the regular Land&eacute; spacing
</p>
<p>of the energies, a second ingredient is necessary to activate the contribution of the
</p>
<p>non-Hund states. The key to a sizeable non-Heisenberg behaviour lies in the inter-
</p>
<p>action of the non-Hund states with the ionic determinants, which in turn interact
</p>
<p>with the singlet and triplet functions of Eq. 5.37. To illustrate this effect, the model
</p>
<p>space is enlarged with the eight ionic determinants that interact with the neutral ones
</p>
<p>defined in Eq. 5.31. The plus and minus combinations of the ionic determinants give
</p>
<p>rise to four singlet and four triplet CSFs with three electrons on one center and one
</p>
<p>electron on the other.

<p>The interaction between the ionic states and the neutral states with Hund coupling

<p>cannot break the Land&eacute; pattern. This is very easily demonstrated by considering the

. Note that taking into

<p>account the interaction of all the CSFs with ionic character leads to more elaborate
</p>
<p>expressions for the energies of S and T , but the principle is the same.
</p>
<p>The simultaneous interaction of the ionic CSFs with S/T and N H3/N H2 makes
</p>
<p>that the non-Hund states gain some weight in the wave function of the lowest triplet
</p>
<p>and singlet states. This is exactly the same mechanism as in the configuration in-
</p>
<p>teraction of singles and doubles. The singles have no direct interaction with the
</p>
<p>Hartree-Fock determinant due the Brillouin theorem, but they appear in the CI wave
</p>
<p>function due to an indirect interaction via the doubles.
</p>
<p>5.10 Rationalize the relative size for the estimates of J extracted from the
</p>
<p>singlet-triplet and from the triplet-quintet energy difference. Hint: compare
</p>
<p>the matrix elements of the ionic determinants with the non-Hund states and
</p>
<p>take into consideration the relative energy of the non-Hund states involved in
</p>
<p>the coupling.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the above-discussed concepts, we first decompose the magnetic cou-
</p>
<p>pling of the Ni-azido complex with angle δ = 0 in Table 5.5. The first column marked
with K results from the diagonalization of the model space with only neutral determi-
</p>
<p>nants. The effect of the different exchange interactions makes the quintet the lowest
</p>
<p>state and no (measurable) deviations from the Heisenberg behaviour are observed.
</p>
<p>The inclusion of the spin polarization introduces important antiferromagnetic con-
</p>
<p>tributions but does not break the Land&eacute; pattern. By adding the ionic determinants to
</p>
<p>the CI wave functions of the three lowest spin states, the magnetic coupling further
</p>
<p>increases as expected. But, more interestingly, we observe a small difference in the
</p>
<p>estimates of J calculated from the singlet-triplet and the triplet-quintet energy dif-
</p>
<p>ference. This non-Heisenberg behaviour becomes more pronounced in the CAS+S
</p>
<p>calculation when the ionic determinants are relaxed, leading to a stronger interac-
</p>
<p>tion with the Hund and non-Hund states. When all electron correlation effects are
</p>
<p>included, the calculated coupling is close to experiment and the deviations are yet a
</p>
<p>little larger.
</p>
<p>It remains to establish which state, singlet or triplet, is most strongly affected
</p>
<p>by the interaction with the non-Hund states. For this purpose, we have decomposed
</p>
<p>the DDCI wave functions of the different spin states and listed the coefficients of

<p>the Hund, non-Hund and ionic CSFs in Table 5.6. If we first focus on the above-
</p>
<p>discussed case of δ = 0, we see that the largest non-Hund contribution appears in
the triplet function. This is in line with the larger matrix element of NH2 with the
</p>
<p>even-numbered ionic states Ii and the lower relative energy of NH2 (one atomic
</p>
<p>non-Hund state) with respect to NH3 (atomic non-Hund coupling on both magnetic
</p>
<p>centers). Hence, it is expected that the non-Hund states stabilize the triplet state more
</p>
<p>than the singlet, and hence, ES &minus; ET &lt; (ET &minus; EQ)/2 as observed in the Ni-azido
complexes.
</p>
<p>Table 5.6 also shows that with increasing angle δ the magnetic coupling is strongly
</p>
<p>reduced, caused by the loss of efficiency of the kinetic exchange mechanism ev-
</p>
<p>idenced by the decrease of the coefficient of the ionic determinants in the wave
</p>
<p>function of the singlet and the triplet wave functions. At the same time, the devia-
</p>
<p>tions to the regular Heisenberg spacing are strongly suppressed as are the coefficients
</p>
<p>of the non-Hund states. This illustrates the role of the indirect coupling of the non-
</p>
<p>Hund states with the neutral determinants via the ionic ones; without significant
</p>
<p>contribution of the ionic determinants, i. e. no efficient kinetic exchange, all possi-
</p>

<p>with sizeable magnetic interaction, small on-site repulsion U , not too large on-site

<p>5.4.2 Decomposition of the Four-Center Interactions
</p>
<p>The four-spin interaction as discussed in Chap. 3 (Sect. 3.4.2) is the effective matrix
</p>
<p>element between the determinants ΦI = |abcd| and ΦJ = |abcd|. Since the direct
matrix element of the electronic Hamiltonian between them is zero (there are more
</p>
<p>than two different columns in the determinants), there must be other, indirect interac-
</p>
<p>tions that account for the non-zero value of this interaction. In analogy to the normal
</p>
<p>two-center magnetic interaction, we will review the role of the ionic determinants in
</p>
<p>the effective matrix elements. Figure 5.14 shows one of the pathways that connects
</p>
<p>ΦI with ΦJ through three different ionic states. In the first step an electron hops
</p>
<p>from site A to B to form the ionic determinant Φα . The matrix element is
</p>
<p>〈ΦI |Ĥ |Φα〉 = 〈abcd|Ĥ |bbcd〉 = 〈a|ĥ|b〉 + smaller
two-electron integrals = tab = t (5.42)
</p>
<p>The two-electron integrals will be detailed in Chap. 6 but are here absorbed into the
</p>
<p>effective hopping parameter tab. The relative energy of Φα is U , the same parameter
</p>
<p>as in the analysis of the two-center interaction. The next step transfers an electron
</p>
<p>with β spin to center C to generate Φβ with energy U . Assuming a square lattice, the
</p>
<p>matrix element with Φα equals t . The third and fourth step are similar and in total
</p>
<p>one gets the fourth-order perturbation contribution of this path to the effective matrix
</p>
<p>element between ΦI and ΦJ by applying Eq. 5.12.

<p>5.11 Equation 5.43 assumes that the energies of Φα and Φβ are strictly the
</p>

and calculate the Coulomb interaction along the path in a simple point charge
</p>
<p>model.
</p>
<p>The path in Fig. 5.14 is not the only possibility to go from ΦI to ΦJ . In fact,
</p>
<p>there are 48 different pathways. Twelve of these start with an electron hopping from
</p>
<p>center A, six with a clockwise circulation and six go in an anti-clockwise fashion.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.15 shows the six clockwise electron circulations starting at center A, the
</p>
<p>upper path corresponds to the one that was discussed before. Putting the energy
</p>
<p>of the di-ionic state&mdash;third column in the middle of the figure&mdash;at 2U , the total

</p>
<p>The comparison of this expression with the one derived for the ordinary two-

<p>center coupling (4t2/U ) shows that Jr is expected to be significantly smaller than
</p>
<p>the interactions described in the standard Heisenberg Hamiltonian, dividing by U 3
</p>
<p>instead of U makes the interaction much smaller. However, the very large prefactor
</p>
<p>in the perturbative estimate makes that the ring exchange is not necessarily negligible
</p>
<p>in all cases. As long as U is not too large and t sizeable, one can expect significant
</p>

<p>Biquadratic exchange: The isotropic linear magnetic exchange can be calculated
</p>
<p>in a rather straightforward way with single determinant spin unrestricted methods.
</p>
<p>Assuming that the BS determinant is a linear combination of the spin states with low-
</p>
<p>est and highest possible spin moment, the Yamaguchi equation (Eq. 4.85) relates the
</p>
<p>energies of the BS and HS determinants with J in a straightforward way, independent
</p>
<p>of the number of unpaired electrons on the magnetic sites involved in the coupling.
</p>
<p>The biquadratic exchange can however not be addressed from energy differences
</p>
<p>only, simply because we have only access to one energy difference, obviously too
</p>
<p>few to determine two parameters.
</p>
<p>Instead one can estimate the strength of the biquadratic exchange in an indirect way
</p>
<p>via the electronic structure parameters U , t and K . To derive the relevant equations
</p>
<p>we need to compare the expressions of the singlet and triplet states in terms of
</p>
<p>J and λ given in Eq. 3.75 with their fourth-order perturbation estimates using the
</p>
<p>matrix elements derived in Sect. 5.4.1. In the first place, we need a common zero of
</p>
<p>energy. This is easily achieved by putting the energy of the quintet state to zero. The
</p>
<p>expressions of singlet, triplet and quintet states in terms of J and λ then become
</p>
<p>E(Q) = 0
E(T ) = 2J
E(S) = 3J + 3λ (5.46)
</p>
<p>The fourth-order perturbation estimates give us expressions in terms of t , U and
</p>
<p>K , and hence, we can relate λ to these electronic structure parameters, which can
</p>
<p>be calculated with spin-unrestricted single determinant methods. To simplify the
</p>
<p>perturbation estimates we neglect α, β and γ , and all intersite exchange integrals
</p>
<p>in the interaction matrices derived in Sect. 5.4.1. The interaction matrices for triplet
</p>
<p>and singlet states then become</p>

<p>Four-center interactions: In Chap. 3, we have seen how the four-center interac-

<p>tions can be extracted using an effective Hamiltonian spanned by the six MS = 0
determinants. To address the ring exchange within a spin unrestricted setting, this
</p>
<p>model space is no longer sufficient, but has to be extended with the MS = 2 and the
four MS = 1 determinants. In any standard implementation of density functional
theory, the main area of spin unrestricted methods, one has only access to the diago-
</p>
<p>nal elements of this 11 &times; 11 model Hamiltonian; matrix elements between different
determinants are not routinely calculated in most quantum chemistry packages. In
</p>
<p>addition, it should be realized that the four MS = 1 determinants are all degenerate
and as was shown in Eq. 3.84, the six MS = 0 determinants are degenerate in pairs.
Hence, one can count with at most five energies, i.e. four energy differences that can
</p>
<p>be used to determine four independent parameters. It is therefore intrinsically impos-
</p>
<p>sible to determine the interaction strength of the three cyclic permutations defined in

<p>nations of the four MS = 0 determinants. The expressions of the states after
configuration interaction given in Eq. 5.5 may give a hint on the CSFs.

<p>b. Calculate the energy expectation values of the four CSFs and place them on the
</p>
<p>diagonal of the matrix.

<p>c. Identify the CSFs as singlet or triplet spin eigenfunctions and label them by

<p>gerade/ungerade spatial symmetry, assuming that the system has an inversion

<p>Chapter 6
</p>
<p>Magnetism and Conduction
</p>
<p>Abstract After the description of the electron hopping in systems where not all
</p>
<p>the magnetic centers have the same number of unpaired electrons, a short account
</p>
<p>is given of the double exchange mechanism in mixed-valence systems. Although
</p>
<p>this phenomenon can certainly be found in transition metal complexes, it is more
</p>
<p>common to happen in doped systems in the solid state. Therefore, the second part
</p>
<p>of this chapter introduces the basics of the quantum chemical approach to magnetic
</p>
<p>interactions in extended systems. The embedded cluster approach will be contrasted
</p>
<p>against band structure calculations. Thereafter, some concepts will be introduced that
</p>
<p>are widely used in the condensed matter physics community. We do not give a full
</p>
<p>description of all the magnetic phenomena in solid state compounds but rather help
</p>
<p>the reader with a quantum chemical background to find its way in the rich literature
</p>
<p>on this topic.
</p>
<p>6.1 Electron Hopping
</p>
<p>In all the magnetic systems described so far the number of magnetic orbitals was equal
</p>
<p>to the number of unpaired electrons. These systems are generally known as half-filled
</p>
<p>systems and the price (in terms of energy) to move an electron from one site to another
</p>
<p>is proportional to the on-site repulsion parameter U. Since this parameter is in general
</p>
<p>huge in comparison to the magnetic interactions, the electrons are considered to be
</p>
<p>immobile or in other words, trapped on the magnetic sites. The situation changes
</p>
<p>drastically when the number of electrons in the magnetic orbitals is no longer equal
</p>
<p>to the number of magnetic orbitals, that is when the system is doped with electrons
</p>
<p>(more electrons than magnetic orbitals) or doped with holes (less electrons than
</p>
<p>magnetic orbitals). In these systems, the electron is no longer necessarily trapped and
</p>
<p>can move from site to site under certain circumstances that will be described below.
</p>
<p>A commonly used classification of magnetic compounds by the degree of electron
</p>
<p>mobility was given by Robin and Day [1], who divided the so-called mixed valence
</p>
<p>compounds into three groups. Class I contains all the compounds where the magnetic
</p>
<p>centers have different oxidation states but the electrons are nevertheless trapped. Class
</p>
<p>III is quite the opposite; the magnetic centers have formally a distinct oxidation state

<p>states of electron hopping
</p>
<p>processes in hole-doped,
</p>
<p>neutral and electron-doped
</p>
<p>magnetic systems
</p>
<p>but the electrons are completely delocalized and in practice all magnetic centers share
</p>
<p>the same average oxidation, often a non-integer number. In between, one finds the
</p>
<p>probably most interesting case of Class II compounds. There is a certain degree of
</p>
<p>localization but the hopping of an electron from one site to a neighbouring one has
</p>
<p>a low energy barrier and occurs frequently.
</p>
<p>In the background of a collection of inactive doubly occupied orbitals h, three dif-
</p>
<p>ferent scenarios can be envisaged to describe electron hopping processes. Figure 6.1
</p>
<p>illustrates these scenarios and from top to bottom we recognize the hopping process
</p>
<p>from a singly occupied orbital to an empty orbital; from a singly occupied to another
</p>
<p>singly occupied orbital; and from a doubly occupied (filled) to a singly occupied
</p>
<p>orbital. Taking the system in the middle as reference neutral system, the upper part
</p>
<p>of the figure is indicative for electron hopping in a hole-doped (or electron-ionized)
</p>
<p>system, while the bottom illustrates the hopping in an electron-doped system. In
</p>
<p>this case the process is often interpreted in terms of hole mobility, where the figure
</p>
<p>illustrates how a hole on site B moves to site A.</p>
<p/>

<p>6.1 Electron Hopping 179
</p>
<p>The probability for these hopping processes is normally condensed into a single
</p>
<p>parameter referred to as tab, but Vab and β (H&uuml;ckel theory) are also used. Intuitively
</p>
<p>one would say that the hopping parameter is the same for all three processes, since
</p>
<p>one electron moves from a to b, while the rest of the occupations stay the same in
</p>
<p>all cases. But the calculation of the 〈ΦI |Ĥ|ΦF〉 matrix element shows that this is not
exactly the case. The interaction matrix elements of the initial and final states are
</p>
<p>easily determined with the Slater&ndash;Condon rules. In the first case, the hopping of an
</p>
<p>electron to an empty orbital is defined by
</p>
<p>ΦI = |hha| ΦF = |hhb|
</p>
<p>t+ab = 〈ΦI |Ĥ|ΦF〉 =
&sum;
</p>
<p>h
</p>
<p>〈ah| 1
r12
</p>
<p>|bh〉 + 〈a|ĥ|b〉 (6.1a)
</p>
<p>where a and b are (orthogonal) atomic-like orbitals centered on the centers A and
</p>
<p>B and h is one of the inactive doubly occupied orbitals. The sum runs over all the
</p>
<p>inactive orbitals. In the second scenario, the initial and final states and their matrix
</p>
<p>element are
</p>
<p>ΦI = |hhab| ΦF = |hhbb|
</p>
<p>t0ab = 〈ΦI |Ĥ|ΦF〉 =
&sum;
</p>
<p>h
</p>
<p>〈ah| 1
r12
</p>
<p>|bh〉 + 〈a|ĥ|b〉 + 〈ab| 1
r12
</p>
<p>|bb〉 (6.1b)
</p>
<p>and finally, the process on the bottom of the figure from doubly to singly occupied
</p>
<p>is described by
</p>
<p>ΦI = |hhaab| ΦF = |hhabb|
</p>
<p>t&minus;ab = 〈ΦI |Ĥ|ΦF〉 =
&sum;
</p>
<p>h

<p>(6.1c)
</p>
<p>The contribution of the inactive doubly occupied orbitals is the same in the three cases
</p>
<p>as is the one-electron term hab. However, the appearance of two-electron integrals
</p>
<p>for those cases with more than one electron in the magnetic orbitals introduces
</p>
<p>differences in the interaction matrix elements.
</p>
<p>Numerical estimates of the hopping parameter are relatively easy to obtain with
</p>
<p>the different computational schemes discussed in Chap. 4. Starting with t+ab in a
centrosymmetric two-site system, two electronic states can be defined with doublet

</p>
<p>In practice, an effective hopping parameter can be obtained from accurate ab initio

<p>slightly more involved. The two doublets are now defined as

<p>6.2 Double Exchange
</p>
<p>The concept of double exchange was introduced by Zener in the 1950s to explain the
</p>
<p>sudden drop in the resistance of certain manganites when an external magnetic field
</p>
<p>was applied [2]. The manganese ions in these compounds have either three or four
</p>
<p>unpaired electrons in the 3d-shell; three electrons in t2g-like orbitals and the fourth
</p>
<p>electron in an eg-like orbital. Electron hopping in such compounds takes place in the
</p>
<p>presence of other unpaired electrons and depending on the inter-site spin coupling of
</p>
<p>the t2g electrons, the eg electron has more or less probability to hop to a neighboring
</p>
<p>site. Assume that the antiferromagnetic coupling dominates in the absence of an
</p>
<p>external magnetic field. As shown in the upper part of Fig. 6.2, the electron hopping
</p>
<p>leads to a state that does not have the maximum spin on the center that receives
</p>
<p>the electron, whereas maximum spin coupling at one site is preferred as stated by
</p>
<p>Hund&rsquo;s rule. By applying a sufficiently large external magnetic field, the spins on all
</p>
<p>centers can be forced in a ferromagnetic alignment. In such a case, see the lower part
</p>
<p>of the figure, the electron hopping creates a high-spin state on the receiving center,
</p>
<p>which corresponds to the local ground state and this is more favorable for electron
</p>
<p>mobility, i.e. an external magnetic field can drastically lower the resistance to electric
</p>
<p>conductance.
</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the electron hopping between two metal centers separated by
</p>
<p>a closed-shell ion, typically O2&minus;, inspired Zener to introduce the concept of double
exchange illustrated in Fig. 6.3. The simultaneous hopping process of an electron with
</p>
<p>α-spin from the first metal center to the O2&minus; ion and from this O2&minus; ion to the second
metal center was held responsible for the hopping. Contrary to the superexchange
</p>
<p>described in Fig. 5.4, the double exchange only involves electrons of the same spin.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the intuitive picture is that since the electron transfers can take place
</p>
<p>simultaneously, in contrast to the superexchange, the double exchange hopping is
</p>
<p>very efficient.
</p>
<p>This simple electron hopping explanation has later been revised to incorporate
</p>
<p>the strong electron-phonon coupling caused by the Jahn-Teller splitting of the Mn3+
</p>
<p>ions. The conduction is due to the hopping of a magnetic polaron rather than a bare
</p>
<p>electron [3].</p>

<p>6.2 Double Exchange 187
</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that even when the intersite interaction is completely neglected
</p>
<p>by putting J (or K &prime;) to zero, the hopping process forces the system into the ferromag-
netic state. Only when J is very strongly antiferromagnetic and t relatively small,
</p>
<p>one may expect a low-spin ground state. In the more common case that t dominates,
</p>
<p>we see that the transfer integral is reduced by the factor (S + 1/2)/(Smax + 1/2).
An important aspect of the physics of double exchange compounds is the inter-
</p>
<p>action between the electron distribution and the movement of the nuclei by vibronic
</p>
<p>coupling in complexes or electron-phonon interaction in extended systems. This goes
</p>
<p>beyond the scope of this book and we refer the interested reader to Ref. [5] for further
</p>
<p>reading.
</p>
<p>Semi-classical description of the double exchange: The first description of the
</p>
<p>double exchange by Zener [2] gave a simple (yet convincing) explanation of the
</p>
<p>strong dependence of the electric resistivity on the strength of the external magnetic
</p>
<p>field. The model only considers the hopping parameter t and assumes that the intra-
</p>
<p>atomic exchange integral is infinitely large, which makes that the electron can only
</p>
<p>move through the material when all spins at the magnetic sites are ferromagnetically
</p>
<p>aligned. A more detailed description was given by Anderson and Hasegawa [6],
</p>
<p>who derived the first right-hand-side term of Eq. 6.26. Here, we will review the
</p>
<p>semi-classical description of these authors to illustrate the concept of spin dependent
</p>
<p>hopping which is the basis of the Goodenough&ndash;Kanamori rules treated in the Sect. 6.4.
</p>
<p>The Anderson&ndash;Hasegawa model describes the electron transfer from site A to B in
</p>
<p>the field of the spin moments SA and SB, which are described as classical vectors. The
</p>
<p>spin moments are not necessarily co-linear but have an angle θ . The justification for
</p>
<p>this semi-classical description is that for large spin moments the quantum mechanical
</p>
<p>description converges with the classical one. Being applied to describe the electron
</p>
<p>hopping in manganites, this approximation is not as severe due to the relatively large
</p>
<p>spin moment on the manganese ions. Since the magnetic axes frames on site A and
</p>
<p>B do not have the same orientation, the basis of spin functions of site A (α and β)
</p>
<p>has to be expressed in terms of the basis of spin functions of site B (α&prime; and β &prime;).
</p>
<p>α = cos(θ/2)α&prime; + sin(θ/2)β &prime; (6.27a)
β = &minus; sin(θ/2)α&prime; + cos(θ/2)β &prime; (6.27b)
</p>
<p>The basis functions of this semi-classical model are φ1 = aα, φ2 = aβ, φ3 = bα&prime;
and φ4 = bβ &prime;, where a and b define the spatial part of the orbitals that carry the
mobile electron. The following definition of the interaction for θ = 0 is used
</p>
<p>〈aα|Ĥ|bα〉 = τ (6.28a)
〈aα|Ĥ|bβ〉 = 0 (6.28b)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188 6 Magnetism and Conduction
</p>
<p>and for θ �= 0, slightly more elaborated expressions are obtained
</p>
<p>〈aα|Ĥ|bα&prime;〉 = 〈a
(
</p>
<p>cos(θ/2)α&prime; + sin(θ/2)β &prime;
)
</p>
<p>|Ĥ|bα&prime;〉 = τ cos(θ/2) (6.28c)
〈aα|Ĥ|bβ &prime;〉 = τ sin(θ/2) (6.28d)
〈aβ|Ĥ|bα&prime;〉 = &minus;τ sin(θ/2) (6.28e)
〈aβ|Ĥ|bβ &prime;〉 = τ cos(θ/2) (6.28f)
</p>
<p>The spin moment of aα and bα&prime; is parallel to SA and SB, respectively. In the simplest
description, the energy of these states with respect to the ones with antiparallel
</p>
<p>alignment (aβ and bβ &prime;) is given by the number of exchange interactions between the
extra electron and the electrons that give rise to the background spin moments SA
and SB.
</p>
<p>E1,3 = &minus;K &middot; 2SA,B E2,4 = 0 (6.29)
</p>
<p>However, in a formalism with correct spin eigenfunctions the energies become
</p>
<p>E1,3 = &minus;K(SA,B + 1) E2,4 = +KSA,B (6.30)
</p>
<p>6.4 Consider a magnetic site with a S = 1 background spin moment (triplet
coupled electrons inϕ1 andϕ2) and an electron inϕ3 that can hop to neighboring
</p>
<p>centers. Calculate the energies of |ϕ1ϕ2ϕ3|, |ϕ1ϕ2ϕ3| and the CSF for the
doublet with triplet coupling for ϕ1 and ϕ2 and compare to the Eqs. 6.29 and
</p>
<p>6.30.
</p>
<p>With these ingredients the matrix representation of the model Hamiltonian can be
</p>
<p>constructed
</p>
<p>|aα〉 |aβ〉 |bα&prime;〉 |bβ &prime;〉
〈aα| &minus;K(SA + 1) 0 τ cos(θ/2) τ sin(θ/2)

〈aα&prime;| τ cos(θ/2) &minus;τ sin(θ/2) &minus;K(SB + 1) 0
〈bβ &prime;| τ sin(θ/2) τ cos(θ/2) 0 KSB
</p>
<p>(6.31)
</p>
<p>In the case of SA = SB = S, the diagonalization of the matrix leads to four eigenvalues
which read as follows:

<p>E = 1

</p>
<p>Figure 6.6 gives a clue on how to simplify this expression. In the first place, we see
</p>
<p>that cos(θ/2) can be written as S0/2S with S0 = |SA+SB|. In a classical description,
that is in the limit of infinitely large S0, the alignment of the spin moment of the
</p>
<p>extra electron to S0 is irrelevant and the total spin moment of the system ST is</p>

<p>directly equal to S0. Applying the same correction for the quantum nature of the spin
</p>
<p>moments as done in Eq. 6.30, we obtain cos(θ/2) = (S0 + 1/2)(2Smax + 1), where
Smax = |SA + SB| + 12 , corresponding to the maximum spin moment that can be
realized by all the unpaired electrons. The second simplification arises from the fact
</p>
<p>that τ ≪ K and justifies the neglect of the term quadratic in τ in the square root. The
expression for the energy now becomes

</p>
<p>Considering the quantum correction due to the use of spin eigenfunctions, τ can

<p>be replaced by 2t, which turns the expression for E&minus; into the first term of Eq. 6.26
and describes the energies of the low-lying states with the spin moment of the extra

alignment, and hence, lie at much higher energy.

</p>
<p>Many of the macroscopic manifestations of the interaction between localized, delo-
</p>
<p>calized or itinerant unpaired electrons in solid state compounds require a description
</p>
<p>that goes far beyond the possibilities of the computational schemes that are rou-
</p>
<p>tinely applied in molecular quantum chemistry. The theoretical treatment of the</p>

<p>190 6 Magnetism and Conduction
</p>
<p>long-range magnetic ordering, Kondo effect, domain formation, superconductivity,
</p>
<p>metal-insulator transitions, etc. belongs typically to the field of condensed matter
</p>
<p>physics and several excellent books have been published on this topic, see for exam-
</p>
<p>ple Refs. [7&ndash;10]. This does however not mean that quantum chemistry cannot con-
</p>
<p>tribute to the understanding of magnetic phenomena in solid state compounds. We
</p>
<p>have already seen in Sect. 3.3 how the calculation of the magnetic interaction para-
</p>
<p>meters can serve as the basis for the calculation of the magnetic susceptibility and
</p>
<p>the determination of the magnetic structure, or more precise the magnetic unit cell.
</p>
<p>In fact, a large part of the parameters that typically appear in the model Hamiltonians
</p>
<p>of condensed matter physics can be calculated accurately through quantum chemical
</p>
<p>calculations provided that one can establish an accurate finite representation of the
</p>
<p>relevant part of the crystal. In the case of molecular crystals, this issue is nearly triv-
</p>
<p>ially answered: taking one or several discrete units as model often suffices to calculate
</p>
<p>the desired microscopic electronic structure parameters. The situation becomes more
</p>
<p>complicated when dealing with ionic lattices (oxides, pnictides among others) and is
</p>
<p>even worse for crystals with only covalently bonded atoms (e.g. silicon or graphene
</p>
<p>doped with holes). There are however several well-established approaches to extract
</p>
<p>reliable information at least for the ionic crystals. Also in the more difficult case of
</p>
<p>(partly) covalent lattices quantum chemical strategies can offer interesting insights
</p>
<p>in the electronic structure related to magnetic interactions.
</p>
<p>6.3.1 Embedded Cluster Approach
</p>
<p>The intrinsic local nature of the interaction between two localized spin moments sug-
</p>
<p>gests the possibility to study the magnetic interactions in solids with a cluster model.
</p>
<p>In this approach, a small yet relevant piece is cut from the crystal and treated like a
</p>
<p>molecule. These bare clusters are only a reasonable choice in the case of molecular
</p>
<p>crystals, but otherwise nearly always too crude a representation. Therefore it is nec-
</p>
<p>essary to account for the effect of the rest of the crystal especially when dealing with
</p>
<p>ionic or covalent lattices. Here, we will shortly review a few representative examples
</p>
<p>of the different approaches for improving the bare cluster model that find their basis
</p>
<p>in the theory of electron separability of McWeeny, the subsystem formulation of DFT
</p>
<p>of Cartona or the incremental scheme of Fulde and Stoll.
</p>
<p>Electrostatic embedding: In the case of ionic compounds, the largest contribution
</p>
<p>to the potential exerted by the rest of the crystal on the (central region of the) cluster
</p>
<p>is due to long-range electrostatic interactions. These are accurately represented by
</p>
<p>the point charge approximation, that is, the Madelung potential:
</p>
<p>VM(κ &isin; K) =
&sum;

<p>6.3 A Quantum Chemical Approach to Magnetic Interactions in the Solid State 191
</p>
<p>where K is the set of ions that belong to the cluster and L contains all other ions,
</p>
<p>q corresponds to the formal ionic charge of each center. This interaction is easily
</p>
<p>included in the calculation by placing an array of point charges around the cluster at
</p>
<p>the lattice sites. Their value is either taken as the formal ionic charge (with fractional
</p>
<p>charges on the edge of the array to ensure charge neutrality) or fitted in such a way
</p>
<p>that a relatively small set of point charges reproduces the electrostatic effect of the
</p>
<p>whole crystal.
</p>
<p>The presence of point charges at lattice sites in the immediate neighbourhood of the
</p>
<p>cluster often artificially polarizes the electron density of the cluster. This polarization
</p>
<p>is especially large when the cluster has anions on the outside and the first shell
</p>
<p>of charges contains positive charges. Actually, this is the common situation when
</p>
<p>magnetic interactions in ionic transition metal compounds are studied. The usual
</p>
<p>cluster has two (or sometimes more) transition metals and the anions (O2&minus;, F&minus;, etc.)
of the first coordination sphere. The first shell around this cluster is formed by either
</p>
<p>the transition metal ions, ternary cations or a combination of these, depending on the
</p>
<p>crystal structure. In any case, positive point charges are located directly around the
</p>
<p>highly polarizable anions causing important distortions of the electronic structure
</p>
<p>not only in the border regions of the cluster, but also in the central part. To improve
</p>
<p>the description a border region is created between the point charges and the cluster.
</p>
<p>In this intermediate region the lattice sites are occupied by potentials that model the
</p>
<p>Coulomb and exchange interactions between the electron density of the cluster and
</p>
<p>the ions in the intermediate region [11]. Figure 6.7 shows how the potentials separate
</p>
<p>the cluster from the bare point charges and avoid the artificial polarization of the
</p>
<p>cluster electron density.
</p>
<p>Density-based embeddings: This approach starts with a calculation on the whole
</p>
<p>system to construct an approximate yet accurate representation of the total density
</p>
<p>ρtot by performing a periodic DFT calculation. Then, a guess density of the cluster is
</p>
<p>constructed from a calculation on the isolated unit or using some simple embedding
</p>
<p>scheme as described above. The total density is now divided in two parts ρtot =
ρ1 +ρ2 and the one-electron embedding potential is constructed from the functional
derivative of interaction energy with respect to the cluster density ρ1.

<p>Eint = T ints + Eintne + Eintxc + EintH + Eintnn
</p>
<p>νemb(r) =

<p>&part;ρ1
(6.37)
</p>
<p>where the interaction energy is written as a sum of the kinetic, electron-nuclear,
</p>
<p>exchange correlation, Coulomb repulsion, and nuclear repulsion energy. This embed-
</p>
<p>ding potential is added to the standard Kohn-Sham equation for the cluster and a new
</p>
<p>energy and density ρ1 are calculated. Since the embedding potential depends on the
</p>
<p>density of the cluster, νemb is updated and the Kohn-Sham equations of the cluster are
</p>
<p>solved again. This process is repeated until a self-consistent description is obtained.
</p>
<p>In addition to the here sketched DFT in DFT (cluster in embedding) procedure, the
</p>
<p>variants with wave function (WF) based methods have also been described. The</p>

<p>bare point charges (the rest is

<p>with the dotted outline in the

<p>intermediate region are
</p>
<p>model potentials that
</p>
<p>separate the cluster from the
</p>
<p>point charges
</p>
<p>WF in DFT approach is especially interesting for the application to systems with
</p>
<p>unpaired electrons because the multideterminental nature of the wave function can
</p>
<p>be rigorously treated while the embedding can be generated with DFT.
</p>
<p>Induced dipoles: There are also embedding schemes that go beyond the static rep-
</p>
<p>resentation of the cluster environment and model the polarization of the electron
</p>
<p>density in response to changes in the electronic structure of the cluster, for example
</p>
<p>ionizations or electron excitation processes. In the so-called shell model, the bare
</p>
<p>point charges are split in a positive point charge (the nucleus) and a negative shell
</p>
<p>(the electron cloud of the ion) connected through a harmonic potential. The shells
</p>
<p>interact with a Buckingham potential and the total energy of the system (cluster +
</p>
<p>shell environment) is minimized not only with respect to the electron distribution in
</p>
<p>the cluster region but also with respect to the position of the shells. Another scheme
</p>
<p>places a set of polarizable dipoles in the environment and the values of the induced
</p>
<p>dipoles are optimized in a self-consistent procedure along with the electron density
</p>
<p>of the cluster.
</p>
<p>Once, a convenient embedded cluster model is constructed, one can apply all
</p>
<p>the regular methods from molecular quantum chemistry to evaluate the electronic
</p>
<p>structure parameters of interest, hopping parameters, magnetic coupling strength,
</p>
<p>local anisotropy, biquadratic exchange, etc. The validity of the embedded cluster
</p>
<p>model has been established in many applications either by comparing the results to
</p>
<p>periodic calculations or by checking the stability of the results against the size of the

<p>The difficulty of constructing spin eigenfunctions with S &lt; Smax for extended sys-
</p>
<p>tems with unpaired electrons makes that most of the periodic calculations are per-
</p>
<p>formed within a single determinant method and no restrictions on the spatial part of
</p>
<p>the spin orbitals. The results are then necessarily interpreted with the Ising model
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian described in Sect. 3.2.2. In practice, the total energy of the magnetic
</p>
<p>unit cell (not necessarily of the same size as the structural unit cell) is calculated for
</p>
<p>different spin orientations (that is, different MS values) and the relative energies are
</p>
<p>compared to the matrix elements of the Ising Hamiltonian to determine the magnetic
</p>
<p>coupling strength between the ions in the crystal. This is not necessarily limited to
</p>
<p>isotropic bilinear coupling but can also be used to extract estimates for biquadratic
</p>
<p>and four-center interactions.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the procedure of extracting magnetic coupling parameters by peri-
</p>
<p>odic calculations, we will focus on the perovskite structure Sr2CuO3, related to the
</p>
<p>previously used spin ladder compound SrCu2O3, although the structural motif here
</p>
<p>is formed by CuO4 units arranged in linear chains along the b-axis of the unit cell.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.8 illustrates the structure of this oxide and indicates the unit cell with a
</p>
<p>dashed box. The unit cell has two symmetry inequivalent Cu2+ ions with an S = 1
2
</p>
<p>spin moment each.
</p>
<p>In the first place, we calculate the energy per unit cell with all spins aligned ferro-
</p>
<p>magnetically as schematically depicted in the left panel of Fig. 6.9. This calculation
</p>
<p>can be done within any spin unrestricted periodic computationally scheme, either
</p>
<p>HF or DFT and it gives us EF(a, b, c). Subsequently, this energy has to be expressed
</p>
<p>as an Ising energy. The Ising Hamiltonian for this compound is defined as
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;Ja
&sum;
</p>
<p>i,j
</p>
<p>Ŝz,iŜz,j &minus; Jb
&sum;
</p>
<p>k,l
</p>
<p>Ŝz,k Ŝz,l &minus; Jd
&sum;
</p>
<p>m,n
</p>
<p>Ŝz,mŜz,n (6.39)
</p>
<p>where the interaction along the c-direction is neglected and Jd is the interaction along
</p>
<p>the body diagonal of the unit cell. As can be seen in the left panel of Fig. 6.9, the unit
</p>
<p>cell contains 8 times the interaction along the body diagonal. The four vertices along
</p>
<p>a and b represent the Ja and Jb interactions, but each of these have to be counted
</p>
<p>only for 1/4 since the vertices are shared by four unit cells. Furthermore, the copper
</p>
<p>ion in the center of the unit cell interact with the copper ions in the adjacent unit
</p>
<p>cells and this contributes two times 1/2Ja and two times 1/2Jb to the Ising energy.
</p>
<p>In total the energy expression becomes</p>

</p>
<p>The calculation of Jb (and Ja) cannot be done with the simple unit cell, no other spin

<p>flips can be made. Therefore, we double the unit cell in the b direction to obtain a

<p>new magnetic unit cell, the super cell (a, 2b, c), represented in Fig. 6.10. The energy

<p>of the fully ferromagnetic supercell is in principle exactly twice EF(a, b, c), but it
</p>
<p>is highly recommendable to repeat the HF or DFT calculation for this double unit

</p>
<p>which allows us to extract Jb, given that Jd is already determined in the simple unit

</p>
<p>Method of increments: By taking the appropriate linear combinations of the delo-
</p>
<p>calized Bloch functions one can construct orbitals that are localized on an atom or a
</p>
<p>small group of atoms of the crystal. These so called Wannier orbitals form the basis
</p>
<p>of the method of increments for calculating the cohesive energy of an extended solid
</p>
<p>[12, 13] and other related properties such as lattice constants, bulk modulus, absorp-
</p>
<p>tion energies, among others. Excited state properties can also be studied and from
</p>
<p>there one has access to the band structure. The method was originally formulated for
</p>
<p>closed shell systems, but recently variants have been developed to treat compounds
</p>
<p>with unpaired electrons. Hence, the method can in principle also be used for the
</p>
<p>study of magnetic interactions in solids.
</p>
<p>In its most basic formulation, the procedure starts with a periodic Hartree-Fock
</p>
<p>calculation. The correlation energy is calculated by increments. The unit cell is
</p>
<p>divided in m subunits Ai, either individual atoms or small clusters of atoms. The
</p>
<p>Bloch functions optimized in the periodic HF calculation are transformed to Wan-
</p>
<p>nier functions that are localized on the different subunits and the local correla-
</p>
<p>tion energy Ecorri = Etoti &minus; EHFi is calculated for each subunit Ai with a stan-
dard (size-extensive) post-HF method. This is not the final estimate because all
</p>
<p>non-additive terms in the correlation energy are still missing. Therefore one sub-
</p>
<p>sequently calculates the two-center corrections through calculations on subunits
</p>
<p>Ai&ndash;Aj: E
corr
ij = Etotij &minus; EHFij &minus; Ecorri &minus; Ecorrj . The index i runs over all groups in
</p>
<p>the unit cell, but j can in principle be any atom (group of atoms) in the system.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, the size of the increment decays rapidly with the distance between the
</p>
<p>groups and hence the number of terms to be calculated remains relatively small. This
</p>
<p>can be repeated with three-center corrections and higher order increments. The total
</p>
<p>correlation energy is then determined
</p>
<p>Ecorr =
&sum;
</p>
<p>i

</p>
<p>Correlated band structures: Periodic single determinant approaches are well suited
</p>
<p>to give qualitative answers or to serve as benchmark for checking the validity of
</p>
<p>embedded cluster results. On the other hand, the accurate treatment of (strong) elec-
</p>
<p>tron correlation effects in crystalline materials, for example to predict the subtle
</p>
<p>interplay of magnetism and electrical conductance, requires an accurate, balanced
</p>
<p>description of all states involved, and this is still a challenge.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.3 A Quantum Chemical Approach to Magnetic Interactions in the Solid State 197
</p>
<p>Examples of strongly correlated systems are transition metal and rare-earth metal
</p>
<p>compounds. In these materials on-site Coulomb repulsion between the metal valence
</p>
<p>electrons dominates the width of the corresponding one-electron energy bands.
</p>
<p>Widely used independent electron methods such as DFT in the local density approxi-
</p>
<p>mation (LDA) are not suited to study the magnetic properties of such systems. There-
</p>
<p>fore, a correction term U to the LD functional has been introduced that accounts for
</p>
<p>the strong on-site Coulomb interactions between d (or f ) electrons on the metal
</p>
<p>ions, giving rise to the LDA+U method [14]. Although LDA+U was introduced as
</p>
<p>a method without adjustable parameters, the values used for U vary significantly in
</p>
<p>different studies on the same compound.
</p>
<p>Within Green function theory, many-electron effects can be introduced through a
</p>
<p>non-local and energy-dependent self-energy operator [15]. Since the self-energy is
</p>
<p>hard to calculate, various approximations are introduced and among the simplest ones
</p>
<p>is the so-called GW approximation, which is derived from many-body perturbation
</p>
<p>theory. Although the GW approximation offers in principle a sophisticated account
</p>
<p>of the electron correlation effects, practical realizations are commonly also based on
</p>
<p>the LDA method.
</p>
<p>Finally, algorithms have been developed which incorporate electron correlation
</p>
<p>effects explicitly in wave function based band theory for crystalline solids [16, 17].
</p>
<p>These algorithms construct the many-electron Hamiltonian matrix for a periodic sys-
</p>
<p>tem by extracting the matrix elements from calculations on finite embedded clusters.
</p>
<p>In this way the incorporation of correlation effects leads to many-electron energy
</p>
<p>bands, not only associated with hole states and added-electron states but also with
</p>
<p>excited states. More recently, Pisani and co-workers [18] introduced a post-Hartree-
</p>
<p>Fock program based on periodic local second order M&oslash;ller-Plesset perturbation
</p>
<p>theory.
</p>
<p>A word of warning is in place when these techniques are employed for the study
</p>
<p>of magnetic interactions. The tiny energy differences associated with these interac-
</p>
<p>tions demand that the procedure is capable to deliver not only an accurate but also
</p>
<p>a balanced treatment of the various states involved. This means that approximate
</p>
<p>computation and cut-offs of integrals etc. have to be exactly the same for all states.
</p>
<p>6.4 Goodenough&ndash;Kanamori Rules
</p>
<p>The Goodenough&ndash;Kanamori (GK) rules have evolved from the studies to explain the
</p>
<p>magnetism in manganese oxides in the 1950s and have been applied ever since mostly
</p>
<p>in the field of ionic insulators; often oxides of one or several third-row transition metal
</p>
<p>ions. Studies of the magnetic interactions in these compounds commonly reduce to
</p>
<p>a three center problem with two metals that carry a spin moment and a non-magnetic
</p>
<p>anion in between. Before explaining the rules, which are sometimes (incorrectly)
</p>
<p>referred to as the Goodenough&ndash;Kanamori&ndash;Anderson rules, we need to introduce
</p>
<p>some concepts related with the electron hopping involving the magnetic sites and the
</p>
<p>ligand that connects them. Goodenough defined superexchange as the virtual electron</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>198 6 Magnetism and Conduction
</p>
<p>transfer between two atoms with a net spin moment and semi covalent exchange as
</p>
<p>the virtual electron transfer between the anion and the two magnetic centers. Note that
</p>
<p>Goodenough&rsquo;s definition of superexchange differs from the one given by Kramers
</p>
<p>(see Sect. 3.1).
</p>
<p>To understand the use of the term virtual in these definitions it is best to contrast
</p>
<p>it against the electron hopping discussed in the previous section for doped or mixed-
</p>
<p>valence systems. These processes represent a real electron movement in which the
</p>
<p>formal oxidation state of the metals changes by &plusmn;1. There are three different cases
as defined in Eq. 6.1, which correspond to electron movement from half-filled to an
</p>
<p>empty orbitals, from half-filled to half-filled and from filled to half-filled orbitals. On
</p>
<p>the contrary a virtual electron transfer process does not cause changes in oxidation
</p>
<p>state and the initial electron count per atom is always restored. It can very much
</p>
<p>be compared to the perturbative interaction paths introduced in Chap. 5, the super-
</p>
<p>exchange is comparable to the mechanism shown in Fig. 5.3 and the semi covalent
</p>
<p>exchange is strongly related to the one depicted in Fig. 5.4. The direct exchange Kab
is normally not considered in the GK reasonings to explain magnetic interactions in
</p>
<p>solid state compounds.
</p>
<p>The Goodenough&ndash;Kanamori rules state that superexchange and semi covalent
</p>
<p>exchange give an antiferromagnetic contribution to the coupling of the spin moments
</p>
<p>on site A and B when the virtual electron transfer is between overlapping orbitals
</p>
<p>that are half-filled. A ferromagnetic contribution arises when the virtual transfer is
</p>
<p>from half-filled to empty orbitals or from filled to half-filled orbitals. Moreover it is
</p>
<p>taken for granted that the electron transfer can only take place between overlapping
</p>
<p>orbitals. For orthogonal orbitals, the hopping is zero and Hund&rsquo;s rule prevails leading
</p>
<p>to a ferromagnetic contribution (Fig. 6.11).
</p>
<p>Figure 6.12 illustrates the prototypical case of the magnetic interactions in the
</p>
<p>CuO2 layers of the parent compounds of the high Tc superconductors. The Cu
2+ ions

</p>
<p>superexchange between two
</p>
<p>overlapping half-filled
</p>
<p>orbitals leading to
</p>
<p>antiferromagnetic coupling
</p>
<p>The virtual electron transfer between these two copper atoms, i.e. the superexchange,
</p>
<p>involves half-filled orbitals and hence contributes in an antiferromagnetic manner to
</p>
<p>the coupling. The semi covalent exchange contributes in the same direction, since
</p>
<p>it also involves the half-filled orbitals on the metals. Together the two effects give
</p>
<p>a qualitative explanation of the strong antiferromagnetic interactions between the
</p>
<p>Cu2+ ions.
The second example concerns LaMnO3, which upon hole-doping shows a spec-
</p>
<p>tacular drop in the electrical resistivity when an external magnetic field is applied,
</p>
<p>the so-called colossal magnetoresistance effect. The electronic configuration of the
</p>
<p>Mn3+ ions is 3d4, with three unpaired electrons in the t2g and one in the eg orbitals
assuming an octahedral coordination of the Mn cations. However, this configuration
</p>
<p>is Jahn-Teller active and induces displacements of the oxygen anions as indicated by
</p>
<p>the arrows in the left part of Fig. 6.13. In consequence, the occupied 3d-orbitals of eg
symmetry are rotated by 90◦ at each magnetic center. This is called orbital ordering
in the literature. Now, the superexchange between half-filled eg orbitals cannot take
</p>
<p>place because they are orthogonal as shown in the left panel of Fig. 6.13. The only
</p>
<p>overlapping eg orbitals are the half-filled on the left and the empty orbital on the
</p>
<p>right, see the right side of Fig. 6.13. The GK rules state that this superexchange (and
</p>
<p>the semi covalent exchange as well) is ferromagnetic in nature. The total interaction
</p>
<p>between the two magnetic centers is therefore expected to be ferromagnetic, although
</p>
<p>attenuated by the superexchange interactions in the weakly overlapping half-filled
</p>
<p>3d(t2g) orbitals.
</p>
<p>In previous chapters we have considered the magnetic interactions in the spin
</p>
<p>ladder compound SrCu2O3. There we focused on the interactions along the legs and
</p>
<p>the rungs, which share the common feature of a linear Cu&ndash;O&ndash;Cu linkage. However,
</p>
<p>taking a closer look at the structure (see Fig. 5.9) it becomes immediately clear that
</p>
<p>these copper ions are not nearest neighbours. Instead, the distance to the copper ion
</p>
<p>on the next ladder is shorter and one could naively think that the interactions of
</p>
<p>such pairs are also important. We have already seen in Sect. 4.2 that the interaction
</p>
<p>between two magnetic centers connected by a (double) bridge making an angle of
</p>
<p>around 90◦ is in general ferromagnetic and rather weak. A qualitative picture of the
weak ferromagnetic interaction can also be obtained by applying the GK rules. The</p>

<p>Fig. 6.13 The virtual hopping on the left is not permitted due to the orthogonality of the (occupied)

</p>

</p>
<p>half-filled orbitals a and b shown on the left side of Fig. 6.14 overlap, and hence, the
</p>
<p>superexchange mechanism gives a antiferromagnetic contribution, albeit rather small
</p>
<p>since the overlap is not very strong. The semi covalent exchange involving a and b is
</p>
<p>inoperative because these two half-filled orbitals do not overlap with the same orbital
</p>
<p>on the anion. To activate the semi covalent exchange we have to consider one of the
</p>
<p>filled 3d orbitals that overlaps with one of the ligand orbitals, which in turn has a
</p>
<p>non-zero overlap with the half-filled 3d orbital on the other cation. Such situation is
</p>
<p>outlined in the right panel of Fig. 6.14, where a&prime; is one of the doubly occupied 3d(t2g)
orbitals (to be more precise the 3dxy in this case) and b the half-filled 3dx2&minus;y2 orbital.
Whereas the overlap of a&prime; and b is zero (no superexchange) both orbitals overlap
with the O-2py orbital and the semi covalent exchange becomes active. Since the
</p>
<p>virtual electron transfer is between a filled and a half-filled orbital, the contribution
</p>
<p>is ferromagnetic.

</p>
<p>can also be rationalized with perturbation theory in the same way as discussed in
</p>
<p>Sect. 5.1.1 for the magnetic interactions in a linear geometry or in Sect. 5.4.3 to derive
</p>
<p>the equations to estimate the magnitude of the four-center interactions with single
</p>
<p>determinant methods. The derivation is similar to the one presented by Koch in Ref.
</p>
<p>[19] with this difference that we here work within a spin restricted formalism.
</p>
<p>There are four orbitals involved in the coupling as can be seen in Fig. 6.14. The
</p>
<p>six electrons can be distributed in sixteen different ways over the orbitals under the
</p>
<p>restriction of MS = 0:
</p>
<p>Φ1 = |a1pxpxpypyb2| Φ2 = |a1pxpxpypyb2| Φ3 = |a1pxpypyb2b2|
Φ4 = |a1pxpypyb2b2| Φ5 = |a1a1pxpxpyb2| Φ6 = |a1a1pxpxpyb2|
Φ7 = |a1a1pxpypyb2| Φ8 = |a1a1pxpypyb1| Φ9 = |a1pxpxpyb2b2|
Φ10 = |a1pxpxpyb2b2| Φ11 = |a1a1pxpyb2b2| Φ12 = |a1a1pxpyb2b2|
Φ13 = |a1a1pxpxpypy| Φ14 = |pxpxpypyb2b2| Φ15 = |a1a1pxpxb2b2|
Φ16 = |a1a1pypyb2b2|
</p>
<p>Taking the energy of Φ1 and Φ2 as reference, the other determinants lie at ∆ECT
(Φ3 . . . Φ6), ∆E
</p>
<p>&prime;
CT (Φ7 . . . Φ10), ∆E2CT (Φ11 and Φ12), Ud (Φ13 and Φ14) and
</p>
<p>∆E2CT + Up (Φ15 and Φ16). The last two determinants are high in energy and
will be neglected. The subscript p refers to the O-2px or 2py orbital and the subscript
</p>
<p>d to the a or b Cu-3d orbital.</p>

<p>202 6 Magnetism and Conduction
</p>
<p>To simplify the derivation of the singlet and triplet energy, we first construct
</p>
<p>spin-symmetry adapted CSFs by forming linear combination of the above-listed
</p>
<p>determinants with unpaired electrons:
</p>
<p>Ψ1,2 =
1&radic;

(Φ1 &plusmn;Φ2) Ψ3,4 =

</p>
<p>Ψ13,14 =
1&radic;
2
(Φ13 &plusmn;Φ14)
</p>
<p>The plus (minus) combinations are triplet (singlet) functions, except for the combi-
</p>
<p>nation of closed-shell determinants Ψ13 and Ψ14, which are both singlets. Now we
</p>
<p>can construct the 6 &times; 6 configuration interaction matrix for the triplet functions and
an 8&times; 8 matrix for the singlet and then determine the energy either by diagonalizing
the matrices or (simpler) with perturbation theory.

</p>
<p>In these matrices we have neglected the intersite exchange integrals Kab and Kpd.
</p>
<p>The hopping parameter tab parametrizes the electron transfer from cation to cation
</p>
<p>and tpd the transfer from O-2px to a and from py to b, which are strictly the same.
</p>
<p>The hopping from py to a is zero by symmetry. This is most easily seen in Fig. 6.14
</p>
<p>(left). The symmetry behavior under 180◦ rotation around the x-axis is different for
py (changes sign) and for a (no sign change). Because the Hamiltonian is totally
</p>
<p>symmetric, the integral 〈py|ĥ|a〉 is zero. A similar reasoning shows that the hopping
from px to b is zero.</p>

<p>of unpaired electrons on one atom makes clear that the energy of Ψ11 will be signifi-

<p>6.5 Spin Waves for Ferromagnets
</p>
<p>The last part of this chapter leaves behind the local viewpoint of the electronic struc-
</p>
<p>ture and explores the description of magnetic interactions from a periodic perspective.
</p>
<p>Let us consider a lattice with N sites. Each site has a spin angular moment of S and
</p>
<p>all spins are aligned along the principal magnetization axis (MS = S), corresponding
to the ground state of a set of ferromagnetically coupled centers. The Heisenberg
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian for such a lattice reads
</p>
<p>Ĥ = &minus;

<p>i&lt;j

<p>Jij

)
</p>
<p>+ Ŝz(i)Ŝz(j)
]
</p>
<p>(6.50)
</p>
<p>and the wave function is characterized by the MS value at each lattice site
</p>
<p>Φ0 = |S1, S2, . . . , Si, Sj, . . . , SN 〉 (6.51)
</p>
<p>To calculate the energy of Φ0 we evaluate the effect of the different terms of the
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian separately and then add them up to obtain the energy.
</p>
<p>Ŝ+(i)Ŝ&minus;(j)|S1, S2, . . . , Si, Sj, . . . , SN 〉 = 0
Ŝ&minus;(i)Ŝ+(j)|S1, S2, . . . , Si, Sj, . . . , SN 〉 = 0 (6.52)

<p>6.5 Spin Waves for Ferromagnets 205
</p>
<p>The zero&rsquo;s in the first two contributions are due to the fact that a spin with maximum
</p>
<p>MS-value cannot climb further on the ladder by Ŝ
+. From this, we confirm that Φ0
</p>
<p>is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue

<p>E0 = &minus;S2

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Next, we study the low-lying excitations of the ferromagnet, following Kaxiras [20].
</p>
<p>To generate an excited state, the MS value at one of the sites is lowered from MS = S
to S &minus; 1 by applying Ŝ&minus;(i) on Φ0, the smallest change that can be imagined. To
ensure that the excited state is also an eigenfunction of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian
</p>
<p>two determinants are needed
</p>
<p>Φ1 = |S1, S2, . . . , Si &minus; 1, Sj, . . . , SN 〉
Φ2 = |S1, S2, . . . , Si, Sj &minus; 1, . . . , SN 〉 (6.55)
</p>
<p>The action of the ladder operators on such functions is defined in Eq. 1.23 and
results in
</p>
<p>Ŝ+(i)Ŝ&minus;(j)Φ1 = Ŝ+(i)
&radic;

</p>
<p>and, similarly,
</p>
<p>Ŝ&minus;(i)Ŝ+(j)Φ1 = 0
Ŝ+(i)Ŝ&minus;(j)Φ2 = 0
Ŝ&minus;(i)Ŝ+(j)Φ2 = 2SΦ1 (6.57)

<p>E+ is identical to the ground state value and the corresponding wave function has the
same spin multiplicity as Φ0 but the total MS value is lowered by one. The second
</p>

system) and describes a state where the total spin moment is no longer equal to the
</p>
<p>maximum value.

<p>6.6 Consider a system with two S = 1 magnetic sites. The ferromagnetic
solution isΦ0 = αααα. Check thatΨ&plusmn; = (MS,max,MS,max&minus;1)&plusmn; (MS,max&minus;1,
MS,max) are indeed eigenfunctions of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and that the
</p>
<p>plus combination corresponds to a quintet and the minus combination to a
</p>
<p>triplet.
</p>
<p>This description of the excited state does however not respect the translational
</p>
<p>symmetry of the crystal and an extra step has to be taken to obtain a more complete
</p>
<p>description. First, we change from discrete point indexation (1, 2, . . . i, j, . . . ,N) to
</p>
<p>a more convenient representation based on the distance between two lattice sites.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.16 shows how the discrete labeling of lattice sites can be replaced by a
</p>
<p>representation based on the distance r between these through the vectors r. Although
</p>
<p>slightly more abstract, this choice is more versatile for an extended system with, in
</p>
<p>principle, infinite lattice sites and translational symmetry.
</p>
<p>The Heisenberg Hamiltonian of Eq. 6.50 remains the same except that the indices
</p>
<p>i and j are replaced by r&prime; and r&prime;&prime;.

</p>
<p>Antiferromagnetic lattices: The description of an &lsquo;infinite&rsquo; lattice with antiferro-
</p>
<p>magnetic interactions is much more complicated and in fact there is no exact ground
</p>
<p>state solution for such case. The first necessary simplification towards an (approxi-
</p>
<p>mate) description is to limit the interactions to nearest neighbours. Imagine a two-
</p>
<p>dimensional regular lattice of magnetic centers. Taking into account only nearest
</p>
<p>neighbour interactions all spins align in an anti-parallel manner. However, consider-
</p>
<p>ing antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbour interactions as well, the spins cannot
</p>
<p>follow the preferred alignment for centers beyond the nearest neighbours as illus-
</p>
<p>trated in Fig. 6.18. This is sometimes denoted spin frustration. In fact, competing
</p>
<p>interactions can give rise to very interesting magnetic phenomena, and Problem 6.4
</p>
<p>describes one of these. In the simplest case of an isolated 1D chain with only nearest
</p>
<p>neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions, an exact solution can be obtained using
</p>
<p>the Bethe ansatz.
</p>
<p>The main problem to rigorously describe the antiferromagnetic lattice&mdash;even
</p>
<p>with the restriction of nearest neighbour interactions only&mdash;lies in the fact that
</p>
<p>the hypothetical ground state eigenfunction of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian is
</p>
<p>intrinsically multideterminantal. With increasing number of magnetic centers the
</p>
<p>Fig. 6.18 Two-dimensional
</p>
<p>lattice of magnetic centers
</p>
<p>with antiferromagnetic
</p>
<p>nearest neighbour
</p>
<p>interactions. Next nearest
</p>
<p>neighbour antiferromagnetic
</p>
<p>interactions cannot be
</p>
<p>sustained. Note that the
</p>
<p>representation of alternating
</p>
<p>up and down spins is a
</p>
<p>simplification that is only
</p>
<p>valid for the Ising
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>210 6 Magnetism and Conduction
</p>
<p>number of determinants needed to describe the antiferromagnetic state also grows.
</p>
<p>For N = 2, we have ΦAF = (|φ1φ2|&minus;|φ1φ2|)/
&radic;
</p>
<p>2; for N = 3, the eigenfunction is a
sum of three determinants: ΦAF = (|2φ1φ2φ3|&minus; |φ1φ2φ3|&minus; |φ1φ2φ3|)/
</p>
<p>&radic;
6; and for
</p>
<p>N = 4, we already need a linear combination of six determinants (see Eq. 1.51). It is
easy to imagine that when we consider a crystal with in principle an infinite number
</p>
<p>of magnetic sites, the wave function cannot be written down anymore.
</p>
<p>Intuitively one could consider the state with alternating α and β spins, as drawn
</p>
<p>in Fig. 6.18, as a good representation of the ground state in an antiferromagnetic
</p>
<p>lattice. However, it is quite easy to show that this so-called Ne&eacute;l state is not an
</p>
<p>eigenfunction of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and that its energy expectation value is
</p>
<p>only an upper bound to the ground state energy. Using the definition of the Heisenberg
</p>
<p>Hamiltonian given in Eq. 6.50 with j = i + 1 and applying periodic boundaries as
mentioned in Sect. 3.3, we calculate the energy expectation value of the Ne&eacute;l state
</p>
<p>Φ0 = |S1,&minus;S2, S3, . . . , Si,&minus;Sj, . . .&minus; SN |. The action of the different products of
spin operators on this function is
</p>
<p>Ŝ+(i)Ŝ&minus;(j)Φ0 = 0
Ŝ&minus;(i)Ŝ+(j)Φ0 = |S1,&minus;S2, S3, . . . , Si &minus; 1,&minus;Sj + 1, . . . ,&minus;SN | (6.72)
</p>
<p>Ŝz(i)Ŝz(j)Φ0 = S2Φ
</p>
<p>This shows that Φ0 is not an eigenfunction of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and that
</p>
<p>the products of spin-up and spin-down operators give both zero contribution to the
</p>
<p>energy expectation value, which becomes
</p>
<p>E(Φ0) =
1
</p>
<p>2
NzS2J (6.73)
</p>
<p>where N is the number of sites and z is the number of nearest neighbours of each
</p>
<p>magnetic center. To show that this is not the state with the lowest energy, we now
</p>
<p>generate a new spin configuration with the same total MS value by applying the
</p>
<p>Ŝ+(k)Ŝ&minus;(l)+ Ŝ&minus;(k)Ŝ+(l) operator to the Ne&eacute;l state. States with different MS values
do not interact with Φ0 and cannot lower the energy of Φ0.
</p>
<p>Φ1 = (Ŝ+(k)Ŝ&minus;(l)+ Ŝ&minus;(k)Ŝ+(l))|S1,&minus;S2, S3, . . . Si,&minus;Sj, . . .&minus; SN |
= |S1,&minus;S2, . . . , Sk &minus; 1,&minus;Sl + 1, . . . ,&minus;SN | (6.74)
</p>
<p>Again, we have a state that is not an eigenfunction of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian,
</p>
<p>which is easily seen by applying the products of spin-up and spin-down operators.
</p>
<p>The energy expectation value is
</p>
<p>E(Φ1) = J

<p>where 〈i, j〉 symbolizes the sum over i &gt; j restricted to nearest neighbours. This

by Φ0 and Φ1 results in two new states, one of them with lower energy than Φ0,
</p>
<p>showing that the Ne&eacute;l state is not the ground state of the antiferromagnetic lattice.
</p>

</p>
<p>with 8 magnetic sites with S = 1/2 in its explicit form using the α(i) and
β(i) spin functions. (b) Calculate the energy expectation value of the Heisen-
</p>
<p>berg Hamiltonian and compare to the outcome of Eq. 6.73. (c) Apply the
</p>
<p>Ŝ+(3)Ŝ&minus;(4)+ Ŝ&minus;(3)Ŝ+(4) operator on Φ0 and calculate the expectation value
of the so obtained wave function (Φ1). (d) Calculate 〈Φ0|Ĥ|Φ1〉.

<p>Spin wave theory of antiferromagnets is a powerful method to study the ground

<p>state in these cases but goes beyond the scope of the book, the interested reader is

<p>6.4 Helical spin order: Consider a one dimensional spin chain with sizeable first
</p>
<p>(J1) and second (J2) neighbour interactions. In the mean-field approximation, the
</p>
<p>energy of the system is given by
</p>
<p>E = &minus;NS2
(
</p>
<p>J1 cos(θ)+ J2 cos(2θ)
)
</p>
<p>In most cases the spins will align either parallel or anti-parallel, depending on the
</p>
<p>sign of J1, but for certain ratios of J1/J2 spin arrangements can be observed with non-
</p>
<p>collinear spin moments. Such spin configurations are supposed to play an important
</p>
<p>role in the ferroelectric properties of magnetic materials. (a) Check that the energy
</p>
<p>expression is identical to the energy of the Ne&eacute;l state (Eq. 6.73) when J2 = 0 and
J1 &lt; 0. (b) Is there any possibility for a non-collinear alignment when J2 &gt; 0?
</p>
<p>(c) Find the three values of θ for which the energy is minimized and classify them as
</p>
<p>antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic or non-collinear solutions. (d) Calculate the angle
</p>
<p>between two neighbouring sites with J2 = &minus;0.3|J1| and J1 = &plusmn;1.

(remember ŝ+ and ŝ&minus; do no commute) = 1/2(ŝ+ŝ&minus; + ŝ&minus;ŝ+) + ŝ2z = 1/2(ŝ+ŝ&minus; +
ŝ&minus;ŝ+)+ (1/2)ŝ+ŝ&minus;&minus; (1/2)ŝ+ŝ&minus;+ ŝ2z = ŝ+ŝ&minus;&minus;1/2[ŝ+, ŝ&minus;]+ ŝ2z = ŝ+ŝ&minus;&minus; ŝz + ŝ2z .
(c) ŝ+ŝ&minus;α = α, &minus;ŝzα = &minus;1/2α, ŝ2zα = 1/4α. Combining the three terms gives
(1&minus;1/2+1/4)α; the expectation value is 3/4. ŝ+ ŝ&minus;β = 0,&minus;ŝzβ = 1/2, ŝ2zβ = 1/4β.
Combining the terms, gives the expectation value (0+ 1/2+ 1/4) = 3/4 for β.

<p>the box (V = &infin;), the second and fourth integral are zero because V = 0 in these

equals γ . Then, E

<p>This shows that both diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements are zero. This means

<p>Exercise 2.7 (a) Taking E(0) as zero of energy, the exponent in the denominator

<p>Exercise 4.4 The symmetry of the complex isD2h and the five d-orbitals by increas-
</p>
<p>ing orbital energy are 3dxz (b2g), 3dyz (b3g), 3dxy (b1g), 3dz2 (ag), 3dx2&minus;y2 (ag), with
the irreducible representation in parentheses. CrIII has a d3 electronic configura-
</p>
<p>tion, occupying the b1g, b2g and b3g orbitals. Ni
II has a d8 electronic configuration
</p>
<p>and the orbitals with unpaired electrons are the two ag&rsquo;s. All exchange paths that
</p>
<p>connect Cr with Ni involve orbitals of different symmetries, implying zero overlap
</p>
<p>between the magnetic orbitals, and hence, ferromagnetic coupling. Replacing CrIII
</p>
<p>with MnII introduces two extra unpaired electrons on site A, and hence, 5&times; 2 = 10
exchange paths. Among the ten exchange paths, the four involving the ag orbitals will
</p>
<p>give a (strong) antiferromagnetic contribution, which counterbalances the (weaker)
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic contribution of the other six paths. The net coupling will be antifer-
</p>
<p>romagnetic.

<p>Exercise 4.5 There are six determinants with two doubly occupied orbitals, six
</p>
<p>MS = 0 determinants can be constructed with all orbitals singly occupied and the
distribution with one doubly occupied orbital, two singly occupied and one empty
</p>
<p>orbital can be realized in 24 different ways. The total CAS wave function is a linear
</p>
<p>combination of 36 different determinants. Note that the use of spin symmetry reduces

<p>the expansion to 20 CSFs for S = 0, 15 CSFs for S = 1 and 1 CSF for S = 2.

<p>Exercise 4.6 We have four reference determinants |. . . aa|, |. . . ba|, |. . . ab| and
|. . . ba|. There are 2k occupied spin orbitals which can be replaced by one of the 2l
unoccupied spinorbitals: 2k&times; l&times;4. In addition there are also replacements involving
a spin-flip, i.e. α &rarr; β and β &rarr; α. This has to be compensated by spin-flip in the
CAS space, which can only be done for |. . . ab| and |. . . ba|: 2k &times; l &times; 2. In total:
12&times; k &times; l.
</p>
<p>Exercise 4.7 The CAS(2, 2) reference contains 4 MS = 0 determinants; n = 4.
There are 72 electrons in the inactive orbitals, k = 36. The system has 154&minus; 36&minus; 2
virtual orbitals, l = 116. This results in 362&times;116&times;4 = 601344 2h-1p determinants,
36&times;1162&times;4 = 1937664 1h-2p determinants, and 362&times;1162&times;4 = 69755904 2h-

<p>calculation one superposes the charge distributions of the three fragments and relaxes

<p>the orbitals in thefield of the frozen charge distributionof the ligandB. JA is calculated
</p>
<p>by calculating the energy difference of the relevant spin states. Subsequently, the

<p>A and JB is calculated. Finally, Jtot from the calculation of the relevant spin states

<p>Exercise 5.10 Since both the interaction elements 〈NH|Ĥ|I〉 are larger (t versus
t/
&radic;
2 for triplet and singlet) and the denominators smaller (2 and 4K), one expects a
</p>
<p>stronger energy lowering for the triplet energy than for the singlet. This means that
</p>
<p>JTQ = (ET &minus; EQ)/2 will be larger (in absolute value) than EST = ET &minus; ES .

and particle (&minus;1 charge) are at r2 =

<p>&minus;1/
&radic;
2r1, and hence, the energies of the ionic determinants are not strictly the same.

<p>Exercise 6.3 The remaining zeros correspond to 〈Φ1|Ĥ|Φ2〉, 〈Φ2|Ĥ|Φ5〉,
〈Φ3|Ĥ|Φ6〉 and 〈Φ4|Ĥ|Φ5〉. In all cases the number of different columns of the
bra-determinant and the ket-determinant is larger than two. These matrix elements
</p>
<p>are zero always as reflected in the Slater-Condon rules. Because of the centrosym-
</p>
<p>metric nature of the model, a2 can be replaced by b2 (and vice versa) in the integrals
</p>
<p>of the Hamiltonian.

<p>Exercise 6.4 Contributions from the one-electron integrals and Coulomb integrals
</p>
<p>are the same in the three cases (h11 + h22 + h33 + J12 + J13 + J23) and will

&minus;K12. With K13 = K23 = K , the energy difference becomes 2K , in line with
Eq.6.29. The doublet function with triplet coupling for ϕ1 and ϕ2 is given in
</p>
<p>Eq.1.46. (1/6)〈2ϕ1ϕ2ϕ3 &minus; ϕ1ϕ2ϕ3 &minus; ϕ1ϕ2ϕ3|Ĥ|2ϕ1ϕ2ϕ3 &minus; ϕ1ϕ2ϕ3 &minus; ϕ1ϕ2ϕ3〉 =

<p>Problem 6.4 (a) When J2 = 0 and J1 &lt; 0, the system corresponds to an antifer-
romagnetic one-dimensional chain with θ = 180◦, then E = &minus;NS2J , equal to the
energy expression of Eq.6.73 with z = 2. (b) When J1 &gt; 0, the spins on all centers
tend to align ferromagnetically, which is reinforced by a positive J2. When J1 &gt; 0,
</p>
<p>the antiparallel alignment of the nearest neighbours results in a parallel alignment
</p>
<p>of the next-nearest neighbours (&ndash;up-down-up-down&ndash;), in line with a positive (ferro-

<p>expression is first rewritten to E = &minus;NS2J1 cos θ&minus;NS2J22 cos2 θ&minus;NS2J2. Then the
energy is minimized with respect to θ : &part;E/&part;θ = NS2J1 sin θ+4NS2J2 cos θ sin θ =
0 &rArr; sin θ(J1 + 4J2 cos θ) = 0. The solutions are θ = 0 (ferromagnetic), 180
