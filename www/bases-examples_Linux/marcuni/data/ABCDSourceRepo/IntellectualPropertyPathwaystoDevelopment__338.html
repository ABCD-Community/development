Dialogues, New Pathways

<p>The subject of this timely and stimulating volume is potentially confronting, 
and certainly provokes new ways about thinking about old subjects. Trade, 
intellectual property and indigenous knowledge systems &mdash; the value systems, 
the cultural contexts, the very world views that these three simple terms can 
evoke are often assumed to be dramatically, fundamentally at odds with one 
another: worlds apart. Yet the past decade, especially, has seen the growth and 
maturing of a remarkable dialogue between these seemingly remote world views. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most heartening, and ultimately the most consequential, 
development has been the process of mutual learning fostered by an extensive 
international debate &mdash; above all, the greater acknowledgement of indigenous 
peoples in policy debates on intellectual property (IP) issues, and the deepening 
respect for their cultures and knowledge systems that has flowed, perhaps 
inevitably, from the opening up of new pathways for the exchange of ideas and 
the sharing of communities' experience. Respect for the distinctive character, 
and recognition of the inherent dignity and worth, of indigenous cultures 
and knowledge systems are surely at the heart of any endeavour &mdash; practical, 
legal, political, conceptual &mdash; to build stronger links, to reconcile differences, 
to create new means of advancing the rights and interests of the custodians and 
practitioners of traditional knowledge systems. 
</p>
<p>With this greater respect and acknowledgement comes a clearer, wider 
recognition that traditional knowledge systems are indeed innovative, dynamic 
and directly relevant to practical needs; that collective and cumulative forms of 
innovation and creativity have value and worth in themselves; that indigenous

</p>
<p>peoples do trade and do engage with the wider community, have done so for 
millennia, and today simply seek to do so on terms that are more equitable and 
culturally attuned.
</p>
<p>Yet the same traditional knowledge debate can also lead the IP policy community 
to reflect deeply about the central tenets of the IP system, its core principles 
and cultural assumptions, indeed its very legitimacy and fundamental policy 
rationale. The traditional knowledge debate may in time be seen as a tonic for 
the policy domain of IP, helping to open up a more informed, more inclusive, 
more broadly based discourse on the role, the principles and the legitimacy of 
the IP system. Critics of IP from the indigenous perspective have helped open up 
a more pluralistic view about the nature of what the IP system can and should 
be, whom it should benefit and how. While some criticism has been intensive, 
and some formal positions expressed in debates can seem irreconcilable, this 
dialogue has required us to unearth some of the foundational principles of IP 
and go back to basics. Why is there such a system of law, what is it for, does its 
actual practice line up with its objectives, what are its policy roots and essential 
principles, what are the embedded values in the system; and, most challenging, 
perhaps, do we need to revisit those values and think about the evolution of 
a more pluralistic system or at least a system that is more representative of 
or practically responsive to the diverse needs, interests and values of peoples 
across the globe, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities?
</p>
<p>Equally, however, dialogue and the sharing of experience have shown more 
positive and culturally appropriate forms of IP protection that transcend the 
constraints, limitations and embedded values that its critics attributed to the 
IP system. First is the assumption that &lsquo;IP&rsquo; is inherently atomistic, is concerned 
about private rights for individuals and commercial firms, and lacks a collective 
or communal character. Secondly, there&rsquo;s the assumption that it is inherently 
time bound, alien to the intergenerational context of traditional knowledge 
systems, with a short-term focus linked to commercial cycles, at best a single 
generational perspective. Thirdly, there&rsquo;s the assumption that IP is a form of 
commodification, that in operation it takes a rich cultural intellectual tradition, 
captures its commercial value &mdash; isolates the easily exploited expressions of a 
tradition of ancient wisdom, culture and spirituality&mdash; and crudely turns them 
into a commodity to be traded on global markets. Each of these assumptions 
manifests a perception of the IP system and perhaps a predominant set of 
practices, rather than articulating its essence and its core principles.
</p>
<p>For those working within traditional knowledge systems, or in other policy 
domains, it is very helpful and timely to revisit such assumptions about the 
IP system, assumptions that may be self-imposed limitations and unwitting 
impediments to new avenues for promoting and defending the interests of 
indigenous peoples and local communities. This is the essential challenge: </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Preface: Indigenous Innovation: New Dialogues, New Pathways 
</p>
<p>xvii
</p>
<p>to explore fundamental ideas about IP that are not constrained by these 
limitations, but rather offer practical pathways to meeting, in part at least, the 
needs and expectations articulated by indigenous communities. The United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has, in setting out 
the rights of peoples as such, articulated their entitlements concerning IP. 
And forms of IP that are communal or collective in character do currently 
exist, and have their place within the formal system; some even need to be 
implemented under the WTO's TRIPS Agreement &mdash; consider performer's 
rights, protection of confidential traditional knowledge, collective marks and 
geographical indications, and the suppression of acts of unfair competition such 
as false claims of indigenous authenticity. But the actual operation and further 
possibilities of these legal mechanisms are explored comparatively little in 
policy debate, and much practical learning is needed about how that collective 
characteristic can be mapped across to the collective legal personality or the 
cultural identity of indigenous peoples. Further, there are indeed mechanisms 
in the current IP system that can transcend a single generation or product cycle 
&mdash; it is not a concept inherently alien to the IP system for rights to endure 
beyond a limited tenure, even if most IP rights are deliberately time-bound. 
There are ways of ensuring an equitable and fair form of IP that does evolve 
with time and does take account of intergenerational factors. The third point 
of critique is perhaps the most challenging and confronting: yet IP need not 
be about commodification or, ironically 'propertisation' as such. What is the 
essence of the IP mechanisms? What is the essential legal character of an IP 
&lsquo;right&rsquo;? Your IP right is not, at core, an entitlement for you to enter the market 
yourself; rather, its central characteristic is that it empowers you to object to 
my &lsquo;commodification&rsquo; of what is yours &mdash; your knowledge, your cultural work 
or your distinctive sign. In principle, its basic legal function is not to promote 
illegitimate or unauthorized commodification of that which someone else has 
originated, but rather to provide a legal means to prevent such commodification. 
So, properly arranged, organised, understood and exercised, there is a notion 
of IP in the broadest sense that amounts to giving indigenous communities a 
say, a degree of leverage over their knowledge, over their distinctive signs and 
symbols, over their cultural works. 
</p>
<p>Thus IP mechanisms can &mdash; in principle at least &mdash; offer three general modes 
for giving practical effect to the expectations of indigenous peoples. One is the 
capacity to object to illicit commodification of their material: a right to object 
if someone misappropriates traditional knowledge and seeks to trivialise it as a 
commercial product. The second aspect is the notion of recognition, the moral 
rights aspect, essentially a right to object when use of material is derogatory 
or insulting, taking reference from this aspect of copyright in particular. The 
third aspect is the right to set the terms for how others make use of protected 
materials, such as traditional works and traditional knowledge &mdash; this last aspect </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>xviii
</p>
<p>has drawn most attention in the debate over the interplay &mdash; current, actual and 
desired &mdash; between traditional knowledge systems and the international trade 
system, notably in the calls for better defined linkages between the operation of 
the patent system and the circumstances and conditions of access to traditional 
knowledge and genetic resources. Much concern has been expressed about 
inappropriate choices, about the wishes and values and interests of indigenous 
peoples being set aside altogether; but there are also interesting positive 
opportunities for communities that do wish to make use of their distinctive 
cultural materials and traditional knowledge in an international context to 
develop economic, scientific and cultural partnerships beyond the community. 
</p>
<p>Reflecting on these options recalls an important practical imperative when 
considering the interactions between the IP system and traditional knowledge 
systems: the point is surely not for an external expert with a laptop and a 
set of fixed ideas to intrude into the domain of the traditional community, to 
tell them how to organise their interests, how to manage their own existing 
knowledge systems. Rather, ideally, at least, it is the other way round: the point 
is to learn from the community about what their interests, and aspirations are 
as a community, and construct mechanisms to enable those values, interests, 
aspirations to be carried beyond the community as it interacts with not only 
its immediate neighbours but also potentially with partners and the general 
public across the globe. Ultimately the most important aspect of the IP system 
is not, after all, the absorbing policy and legal debate that continues to unfold 
internationally, but rather the challenge of developing implementation strategies 
and the application of practical tools that deliver the expected benefits in a 
workable manner that is appropriate for the community itself &mdash; yielding in 
actual practice the implicit promise of the general principles and objectives of 
the IP system.
</p>
<p>So, if the focus should be on the specific context of local communities, and 
on the practical use of IP tools at the grass roots level, what then to make of 
the international dimension? How to bridge between the intrinsically local and 
the fully global is surely the defining challenge of the debate about traditional 
knowledge, IP and trade. Once again, we have seen a broadening of perspective 
and a wider sense of the interests engaged by multilateral IP and trade systems. 
Surveying the array of recent international debates and negotiations dealing 
with these intersecting policy domains, one can discern a widespread push for 
the recalibration of what can be considered the &lsquo;terms of trade&rsquo; for knowledge 
resources &mdash; redefining the distribution, on what is argued to be a more 
equitable basis, of the benefits that result from the use of knowledge resources 
as feedstocks for trade and commerce. Several international negotiations seek to 
rebalance the relationship between those who can provide access to traditional 
knowledge and genetic resources &mdash; the gatekeepers and custodians &mdash; and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Preface: Indigenous Innovation: New Dialogues, New Pathways 
</p>
<p>xix
</p>
<p>those who seek to benefit from access to those materials. Understanding and 
redefining the relationship between the providers of access, the custodians 
of traditional knowledge systems and genetic resources on the one hand, and 
the downstream users of this material on the other, is a more productive and 
enabling way of considering the IP issues. It offers an opportunity to move 
beyond the conventional structurings of IP policy, which divide the world into 
static binary caricatures separating right holders and content consumers &mdash; 
North and South, private and public, haves and have-nots &mdash; and instead to 
explore a more pluralist and fluid set of rights, interests and responsibilities 
in the light of the intellectual and cultural riches of indigenous peoples and 
traditional communities. This recalibration of the equitable terms of access to 
traditional knowledge resources has been evident in the work of the Convention 
on Biological Diversity (CBD). The Nagoya Protocol under the CBD is a 
significant milestone in this development, not least through its more extensive 
recognition of traditional knowledge as such and the obligation for foreign 
jurisdictions to respond to breaches of access rules in the country of origin. A 
pivotal instance, too, is the work currently under way in the World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO) Intergovernmental Committee (IGC) to develop 
international legal instruments on traditional knowledge, traditional cultural 
expressions and genetic resources. This active process offers the prospect of 
a major advance in recognising the entitlement of custodians and holders 
to set the terms of access and use of their traditional knowledge, traditional 
cultural expressions and genetic resources. A similar recalibration of interests 
has been apparent in the work of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Driven 
in particular by a coalition of like-minded developing countries, one of the 
principal trade-related IP issues discussed as an implementation issue under 
the aegis of the Doha Declaration concerns whether, and if so how, the patent 
system should take account of or otherwise link to the obligations that a user 
of traditional knowledge and genetic resources assumes when accessing and 
exploiting these materials. 
</p>
<p>While the TRIPS Agreement is focused entirely on conventional forms of IP, 
its conclusion and implementation within the context of trade law and policy 
presaged a broadening of the array of interests and active players engaged with 
the international law and policy of IP. Its perceived reach and impact have also 
precipitated critical analysis about the role and limitations of the IP system in 
the form of a series of &lsquo;TRIPS and&hellip;&rsquo; debates: TRIPS and food, biodiversity, 
development, human rights, health and so on.
</p>
<p>While other vital questions such as patents and access to medicines have pressed 
forward in international IP policy debates since TRIPS came into force in 1995, 
it is the traditional knowledge debate that has been the most searching, the most 
far reaching, and ultimately the most insightful as to the essential character </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>

</p>
<p>and rationale of the IP system. Its significance is apparent from the trajectory 
the debate has taken over the past decade. Concerns about possible tensions 
between traditional knowledge and IP have emerged, in turn:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 first, as a point of resistance to conventional IP norms &mdash; a critical and 
defensive position; 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 secondly, as a point of pressure for reform and for resituating the system &mdash; a 
revisionist position; and 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 thirdly, as embodying social and economic concerns that form part of the 
interests which are positively asserted in trade fora &mdash; a position asserting 
positive trade interests.
</p>
<p>The initial tenor of the debate was essentially critical and sceptical of the 
relevance and appropriateness of the IP system for traditional knowledge 
systems. Critics assumed the IP system to be diametrically at odds with 
traditional knowledge systems, and argued that it was little more than a tool 
of misappropriation and illicit commodification: that IP is atomistic, concerns 
only private individual rights, takes a narrow, culturally specific approach, 
and lacks applicability to intergenerational and collective forms of innovation 
and creativity. This critical agenda saw traditional knowledge systems as in 
need of protection from IP, and ruled out the search for solutions within the 
IP system as inherently inappropriate. The second phase &mdash; building on a 
richer, broad-based dialogue about the essential principles of IP law and legal 
mechanisms &mdash; identified positive avenues for the fulfilment of the needs and 
expectations of indigenous peoples and other traditional communities. The 
2007 recognition, in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
of the right of indigenous peoples to &lsquo;maintain, control, protect and develop 
their intellectual property over &hellip; cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and 
traditional cultural expressions&rsquo; marked a significant insight into IP within the 
indigenous context. Partly this development entailed making practical use of 
IP mechanisms to provide immediate solutions, but at a policy level this shift 
in emphasis saw concerns about traditional knowledge acting as a point of 
pressure for reform, and for resituating the system &mdash; almost literally recentring 
the system on a wider geographical and social base to recognise the needs 
and context of knowledge-holders beyond the scope of those conventionally 
perceived as having an interest in the IP system. The traditional knowledge 
perspective provided a fresh perspective for the reconsideration, reform and 
refocusing of the IP system. The work of the WIPO IGC, drawing on the existing 
array of IP principles, adapting and applying them to traditional knowledge, 
and developing further cognate principles, is the epitome of this second stage.
</p>
<p>The third phase, a kind of systemic consolidation of the second stage, is 
characterised by traditional knowledge forming part of the concrete interests </p>

</p>
<p>that some countries bring to the table when they debate and negotiate on a 
fair and equitable IP system and seek to settle the conditions of international 
trade. For instance, the 2008 Economic Partnership Agreement between the 
CARIFORUM states and the European Union (EU) included a significant section 
on genetic resources, traditional knowledge and folklore. The later EU-Central 
America association agreement also recognised the significance of these issues, 
and the 2011 Multiparty Trade Agreement between the EU, Colombia and Peru 
included more detailed provisions. In 2008, a broad coalition of developing 
countries and European countries proposed that as part of the WTO&rsquo;s Doha 
Work Programme, WTO members should agree to amend the TRIPS Agreement 
&lsquo;to include a mandatory requirement for the disclosure of the country providing/
source of genetic resources, and/or associated traditional knowledge &hellip; in patent 
applications&rsquo;. While the scope and practical impact of these measures is currently 
uncertain (and ongoing work on the link between the TRIPS Agreement and the 
CBD has not yielded substantive results to date), the immediate point to observe 
is that developing countries are now identifying interests in this domain as one 
element what, to them, should comprise an overall comprehensive deal on a 
host of trade issues.
</p>
<p>This recalibration of interests can be seen from at least four perspectives: 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 empirical: the evidence of patent statistics and the development of new 
standards, metrics and classification tools recognising aspects of traditional 
knowledge;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 jurisprudential: the forms of innovation, &lsquo;skill in the art&rsquo;, that are recognised 
by the patent system, and the assumptions about innovation and creativity 
that lie within ostensibly &lsquo;technical&rsquo; standards;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 the practice of trade negotiations: the emergence of traditional knowledge as 
a concrete strategic trade interest;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 development policy: traditional knowledge systems as a contribution to 
sustainable, culturally appropriate development strategies.
</p>
<p>Empirically, patent statistics provide evidence of a sustained increase in 
the efforts of researchers in the developing world to capture the benefits of 
traditional knowledge systems that are rooted in their own countries. Without 
entering into analysis of the nature and impact of such research programmes 
and patenting activities, they do at least illustrate how some developing 
countries are exercising their interests in their heritage of genetic resources and 
traditional knowledge systems. Jurisprudentially, the concerns that drive the 
traditional knowledge debate have had some influence on the character of IP 
law. Often cited in this context are the Australian Federal Court cases in the 
field of copyright which gave recognition to the customary law background 
and cultural context of indigenous artistic creativity, and the interests of the </p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>xxii
</p>
<p>community that stands behind a traditional artist. We see more recently a series 
of initiatives to build recognition of traditional knowledge and traditional 
creativity directly into IP law. Examples include the 2005 revision to the Patent 
Law of India, which explicitly excludes from patentability certain forms of 
traditional knowledge out of concern that they are inappropriate subject matter 
for patents; and the New Zealand Trade Marks Act of 2002 which gave explicit 
protection to Māori culture under the broader principle of avoiding offensive 
registration of trade marks, with the guidance of a Māori Trade Marks Advisory 
Committee which forms part of the registration process. 
</p>
<p>The trade and development dimension of this recalibration of interests is 
apparent in the negotiations and policy debates touched on earlier. It is striking 
that the two clusters of issues regarding the TRIPS Agreement that are being 
actively considered under the aegis of the Doha work programme &mdash; TRIPS 
and the CBD, and geographical indications &mdash; both have significance for 
traditional knowledge systems. The TRIPS-CBD debate specifically pivots on 
the question of what recognition, if any, the patent system might be required 
to give to the circumstances of access to, and use of, traditional knowledge 
and genetic resources. And geographical indications have been explored as one 
tool for ensuring recognition in international markets of the distinctive qualities 
of indigenous products when traded with the consent and involvement of 
communities. When local and indigenous communities do choose to develop 
wider commercial relationships, protection of distinctive signs and traditional 
names is often one of the important entry points into the international trading 
system. The two clusters of issues both have a bearing on the development 
interests of developing countries, and both concern the claims of indigenous 
peoples and local communities for their interests to be appropriately protected. 
Another example of this recalibration of interests is the recommendation under 
the WIPO development agenda that the WIPO IGC should indeed accelerate 
its work towards an international instrument on the protection of traditional 
knowledge. Accordingly, we have seen a major rebasing of the interests that 
countries bring to the table. Ideas, concepts and concerns that were perhaps 
considered tangential or barely relevant to the IP system a little more than a 
decade ago are now central to work being done by two of the main international 
institutions &mdash; WIPO itself and the WTO. And from the human rights 
perspective, it is striking that the one multilateral human rights instrument 
that explicitly recognises rights over IP as such is the Universal Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This recognition is surely a remarkable sign 
of a more pluralistic understanding of what IP is and whose interests should be 
recognised within an IP system &mdash; an indication of a broader and more inclusive 
framework than was conceived of some two decades ago when the main elements 
of the TRIPS Agreement were concluded.</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>One of the most challenging and fascinating questions that has arisen in 
this debate, raising deep jurisprudential issues, concerns the recognition of 
indigenous customary law in the framework of enhanced protection of traditional 
knowledge and cultural expressions. There has been a consistent call for this 
form of recognition by a number of indigenous representatives in international 
discussions. It is a question that raises policy, academic and theoretical issues, 
but also highlights the difficulties of establishing a fully international form of 
recognition and protection of traditional knowledge systems which is workable 
and effective, yet remains true to, and a legitimate expression of, the local, 
customary context of such systems. Some advocates contend that an overarching 
comprehensive system of recognition and protection of indigenous knowledge 
will always be incomplete, will always be subject to some unease or uncertainty, 
unless it is able to give some form of recognition to the customary law that 
defines custodianship rights, responsibilities or other obligations over traditional 
knowledge, that defines what amounts to appropriate use and inappropriate 
use of traditional knowledge. The challenge is to take what is a matter of law, 
practice and custom intrinsically embedded in the life of a community and have 
that recognised in an international or foreign context &mdash; &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; in two senses: 
literally, in a jurisdiction potentially across the other side of the earth; and in 
the sense of not having an understanding of deeper values, spirituality, customs 
and traditions that are embedded in the traditional knowledge system. If an 
ignorant or malign external third party enters into an indigenous community, 
into the traditional customary context, and appropriates aspects of traditional 
knowledge in violation of customary law or practices, what would it mean for 
an effective legal system to apply in a foreign jurisdiction so as to recognise the 
breach of customary law or practices? If customary law is to provide any kind 
of guidance, its very diversity needs to be recognised. 
</p>
<p>An illuminating element of the international debate has been the willingness 
and the capacity of indigenous and local communities to step forward directly 
and explain to IP policy makers the practical role of customary law and practices 
within their communities' use and custodianship of traditional knowledge 
systems, and the rich diversity of custom, law and practice that are embedded 
within communities' lives. Yet this very diversity underscores the inevitable 
constraints that will be struck when seeking recognition of customary law 
beyond the original community. Some options may, however, merit exploration 
and speculation. The pivotal issue in the traditional knowledge debate has, after 
all, been how to recalibrate, and then to monitor and police, the conditions of 
access to traditional knowledge. When I enter a community, or deal with it, I 
may, as a direct undertaking on my part, agree to be bound by certain customary 
constraints as a condition of access to traditional knowledge, potentially 
constituting one element of the mutually agreed terms governing downstream 
use and application of traditional knowledge and genetic resources. This process </p>

</p>
<p>xxiv
</p>
<p>would both educate and sensitise me as to what my liabilities and responsibilities 
are, and would also bind me in a direct legal sense to recognise what constraints 
I need to recognise in my downstream use of that material. This is not to 
advocate any particular approach, but to reflect on some pathways that might 
yet be explored. The customary law issue is emblematic of the wider challenges 
addressed in this volume &mdash; it raises fundamental legal and policy questions, 
alongside basic practical questions, about what tools and mechanisms will be of 
actual use and benefit to indigenous peoples and local communities as they seek 
to promote and defend their interests beyond the traditional circle. Sustainable, 
effective solutions will ultimately need to reconcile legal, policy and practical 
demands so as to yield an inclusive and sound legal and policy platform, the 
basis for the effective deployment of practical tools for the more immediate 
benefit and interests of communities. The wealth and diversity of insights in 
this volume &mdash; joining together indigenous, IP and trade policy perspectives &mdash; 
offer invaluable ideas for how this might be achieved. The volume exemplifies 
the kind of dialogue and mutual learning that must underpin true progress in 
this vitally important but still challenging domain of policy debate, normative 
development, and the application of law in practice. </p>

<p>1. Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation and 
Intellectual Property: The Issues
</p>
<p>Peter Drahos and Susy Frankel
</p>
<p>1. Introduction
</p>
<p>It is easy to find examples of international fora in which actors engage with 
the issues raised by the confluence of indigenous knowledge and intellectual 
property. A list would include the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), 
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Union for the 
Protection of New Varieties of Plants, the United Nations Educational Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), various UN human rights bodies, 
the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the World Trade 
Organization (WTO).1 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property and indigenous knowledge are concepts that for a 
long time travelled separate historical pathways. Intellectual property (IP) 
is a generic term for systems of positive law, some of which, such as patent 
law, have medieval origins and some, such as integrated circuits law, that 
are of comparatively recent origin. A definition by extension would include 
copyright, database protection, designs, geographical indications, integrated 
circuits protection, plant variety protection, patents, trade marks, trade secrets, 
and actions in passing off or unfair competition (the nature and titles of which 
will vary between jurisdictions). These different systems are grouped together 
because they grant exclusive rights of ownership in abstract objects such as 
signs, algorithms and gene sequences.2 Indigenous knowledge is a much older 
phenomenon than IP, but it has existed as a concept within Western scholarship 
for only a short time, previously being most closely linked to anthropology and 
emerging as a distinct concept in the 1980s.3
</p>
<p>The intersection of indigenous knowledge and IP comes about because of 
a number of factors, including the creation by indigenous people of global

<p>political networks in the second half of the twentieth century, the recognition 
of the economic value of indigenous knowledge and the increasing activism of 
developing countries around international IP rights. The next section of this 
chapter focuses on this history in a little bit more detail, bringing out the way 
in which the international discussions around indigenous knowledge and IP 
have conceptually partitioned the protection of indigenous knowledge from the 
core issue of land rights justice &mdash; the very issue that led indigenous people to 
globalise networks of resistance to colonisation. The report of the New Zealand 
Waitangi Tribunal, published in 2011, is perhaps unique in that it recognises 
that mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) and rights in its intangible values are 
intimately connected to Māori relationship with the land and the environment. 
The report states: 
</p>
<p>Māori culture as we know it today is a creation of its environment&hellip;
[T]he elements that make it distinctive in the world can be traced to 
the relationships kaitiaki [guardians] built up with the land, water, 
flora, and fauna of this place. In this way, the mauri, or inner well-
being of land and water spaces, and the whakapapa [genealogy] of flora 
and fauna do not just serve to articulate the human relationships with 
these things; they are the building blocks of an entire world view and 
of Māori identity itself. They play a similar role to the core definers 
of Western culture such as the arts, democracy, the rule of law, and 
so forth. But while the more human-centred Western culture tends to 
define itself by reference to its own thought and labour, Māori culture 
relies on pre-existing, pre-human definers &ndash; mountains, rivers, plants, 
animals, and so on. Māori culture seeks to reflect rather than dominate 
its surroundings. That is why the relationship between humans and 
taonga species is a definer of Māori culture itself. It is a preoccupation of 
the body of distinctive Māori knowledge that today we call mātauranga 
Māori.4
</p>
<p>The principal purpose of this chapter is to address the broad question of 
whether IP systems can serve indigenous innovation systems. To foreshadow 
our argument a little, indigenous innovation is often place-based innovation 
that is cosmologically linked to land and an indigenous group&rsquo;s relationship 
with that place, rather than to laboratories. Supporting indigenous innovation 
requires an integrated model of IP rights, real property, and traditional law and 
customs. That poses a challenge for Western legal traditions that have over a 
long period parsed property into finely grained taxonomies of real and personal 
property rights, the latter underpinning complex processes of securitisation in

<p>early, middle and late capitalism.5 In Australia, the High Court has recognised 
the spiritual dimension of Aboriginal native title, but has also made it clear that 
native title rights and interests do not constitute a separate system of IP for the 
control of cultural knowledge.6 Native title is not an institution of the common 
law, but its interpretive evolution does take place within the basic structure of 
Australia&rsquo;s statutory and common law property institutions.7 This considerably 
diminishes the prospect of Australian courts recognising a system of native title 
rights for the control of intangible property.
</p>
<p>Indigenous or traditional knowledge (on the use of these terms, see section 4 
below) is often said to have a dynamic quality, but there has been little explicit 
analysis of the features of indigenous innovation systems that presumably 
must be responsible for this dynamism. Instead the tendency is to conceive 
of indigenous knowledge, either explicitly or implicitly, as useful knowledge 
in propositional form. Innovation is often conceptualised in terms of firms 
developing new products and processes.8 The ethnobotanical records in 
Australia and New Zealand provide some examples of indigenous innovation 
that fit with this standard approach. For example, recorded interviews with 
Wagiman elders show that the Wagiman people developed products and 
processes. The leaves of the ironwood tree, for example, were used as a fish 
poison and the roots provided the basis for the production of a glue.9 Similarly, 
the Wagiman discovered a method for producing a damper from the seeds of 
cycas canalis (bush palm) that is suitable for long-term storage and has high 
food energy.10 Much is also known about the uses of New Zealand endemic 
plants and Māori uses of them.11 Harakeke (commonly called flax) is central to 
mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) and to traditional Māori life. It &lsquo;provides 
shelter, garments, fine fibre for weaving (muka), and powerful medicines for a 
multitude of ailments&rsquo;.12 Another example is manuka, a tree that is valued for 
numerous properties, including its oil and honey that has exceptionally high 
antibacterial properties.13 These properties have been investigated by Western 
scientists14 and utilised in many business ventures.

<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>If we think of indigenous knowledge in terms of useful propositions, then it 
follows naturally &mdash; at least for lawyers &mdash; that one can ask and answer the 
question of whether a given item of propositional knowledge falls within the 
scope of protection of one or more IP systems. Detailed rule-based analyses of 
the various individual IP systems show that some systems, especially copyright, 
have some utility for the protection of traditional knowledge.15 However, the 
limitations of those systems are precisely why much of the discussion about the 
protection of indigenous knowledge has primarily developed in fora, such as 
the CBD and the FAO, which are not primarily concerned with IP.16
</p>
<p>However, the focus of this book is not the on protection of indigenous knowledge 
propositionally conceived, but rather on the system of indigenous innovation 
that is responsible for the Wagiman people, for example, producing new 
products and processes. The generation of useful knowledge and techniques 
implies a set of institutions working in convergent ways to produce innovation.17 
A systems perspective on innovation requires one to look more broadly at the 
institutions that contribute to innovative performance, as well as the distinctive 
linkages and interactions amongst institutional actors that characterise an 
innovation system.18 In the context of modern economies, this usually involves 
an examination of the linkages amongst firms and their industrial research 
laboratories, universities and government laboratories, as well as an examination 
of the role of institutions such as tax and venture capital markets.19 In the case 
of indigenous innovation systems, there will obviously be a different set of 
institutional linkages, including linkages amongst cosmological institutions, 
sacred sites and kinship systems. These linkages may extend to Western scientists 
working within a framework that is compatible with indigenous peoples&rsquo; 
expectations (for an example, see Chapter two). The fifth section of this chapter 
suggests some institutional features of indigenous innovation, but this part of 
the analysis should be seen as preliminary. The analysis draws on the studies 
of Aboriginal people from Australia and Māori in New Zealand. Institutions 
of indigenous innovation are highly context dependent and less susceptible to 
the kind of harmonising influences of globalisation that have brought about

</p>
<p>the institutional convergences that we see taking place in capitalist innovation 
systems. This sets limits on the extent to which one can generalise about them. 
A full institutional analysis of indigenous innovation is an interdisciplinary 
quest in which a number of disciplines, including ethnobotany, cognitive 
anthropology and human ecology, play a crucial role.20
</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this chapter is to bring into focus a distinction between 
indigenous knowledge and indigenous innovation, and then to identify some 
of the institutional characteristics of the latter. Following on from this, the last 
section of the chapter discusses which systems of IP are likely to best support 
systems of indigenous innovation. Other chapters in this book also explore 
this issue. This is a different question from asking which items of propositional 
knowledge are most effectively protected by which IP rules. A patent may 
represent the best fit between an active ingredient derived from a plant and the 
indigenous group with traditional rights over the plant, but it does not follow 
that the patent system is the best system for the innovation system of people of 
which that group is a part. 
</p>
<p>2. The Search for Justice: From Individuals to 
Global Indigenous Networks
</p>
<p>When European states colonised countries, the land ownership systems of 
the original inhabitants of those countries generally underwent a radical 
transformation21 or, as in the case of Australia, were extinguished altogether.22 
Unable to find land rights justice within settler societies, some indigenous 
groups from countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand took their 
cause to seats of power in Europe. For example, delegations of Māori travelled 
to England in 1882, 1884, 1914 and 1924 in an attempt to meet with monarchs.23 
Among the petitions organised by the Aboriginal leader William Cooper was 
a petition of 1937 addressed to King George V. It contained 1,814 signatures of 
Aboriginal people, and asked for Aboriginal representation in the Australian 
</p>

of Indigenous Knowledge: A New Applied Anthropology&rsquo; (1998) 39 Current Anthropology 223; F Berkes, 
Sacred Ecology (2nd ed, Routledge, 2008) 22.

Selling the Land: Governments and Māori Land in the North Island 1865&ndash;1921 (Victoria University Press, 2008).
22 More than 200 years later this was found to be the wrong view of the law. The Australian High Court 
in its famous Mabo decision found that the reception of British law into Australian colonies did not produce 
the chain of extinguishment supposed by colonial legal authorities. See Mabo v Queensland [No 2] (1992) 175 
CLR 1 (&lsquo;Mabo&rsquo;).

<p>Parliament.24 In 1923 Deskaheh, a chief of the Cayuga, travelled to the League of 
Nations as a spokesman for the Six Nations of the Iroquois League.25 In essence 
he wanted the League of Nations to help the Iroquois League gain the sovereign 
independence and territory that had been agreed to by King George III but was 
now opposed by the Canadian Government. Anthony Fernando, whose mother 
was Aboriginal, left Australia for Europe in the early 1900s. Deported from Italy 
to Britain in 1923 for distributing pamphlets declaring the extermination of 
indigenous people by the British in Australia, he spent his days in England in 
sole protest, at one stage regularly appearing outside Australia House in London 
in a coat covered with toy white skeletons.26 The skeletons, he said, depicted the 
fate of his people.
</p>
<p>These and other attempts like them generally ended in failure. The Australian 
authorities never forwarded Cooper&rsquo;s petition. Deskaheh left Geneva without 
success, and died alone in New York in 1926. Fernando died in a mental hospital 
in Essex in 1946.
</p>
<p>Indigenous people nevertheless persisted with the strategy of globalising their 
fight for justice. The evolution of the UN system, which began with the United 
Nations Charter of 1945, created new opportunities for them. The language of 
human rights treaties seemed full of evocative promise: &lsquo;All peoples have the 
right of self-determination&rsquo; (Article 1.1 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights). The indigenous networks of political mobilisation and 
negotiation that evolved around indigenous peoples&rsquo; issues concentrated on 
developing a broad rights-based agenda at the highest levels of international 
law-making.27 However, IP remained a technically obscure subject and there 
was little understanding of its connections with indigenous knowledge systems. 
This, as the next section makes clear, began to change slowly in the 1980s.
</p>
<p>3. Enter Developing States
</p>
<p>After World War II many developing countries became sovereign states. One of 
the consequences of this particular wave of decolonisation was that developing 
states began to press for the reform of the international IP framework.

</p>
<p>These reform attempts, which became part of a broader and deeper push during 
the 1970s for a New International Economic Order, ultimately failed.28 Moreover, 
during the 1980s developing countries came under trade pressure from the US 
to comply with standards of IP protection that favoured US export interests.29 
Developing countries also found themselves having to defend against moves by 
the US and EU to bring IP standards into the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade negotiations that had begun in 1986. Developing country attempts to 
defeat this US and EU agenda also failed.
</p>
<p>The issue of indigenous knowledge and IP remained in the shadows. It gained 
some limited recognition in the publication of the Tunisian Model Copyright 
Law in 1976.30 This law recognises copyright in works of national folklore, a 
concept that has some overlap with indigenous knowledge.31 Two events in 
the early 1990s helped to bring about the convergence of IP and indigenous 
knowledge as part of the formal work programmes of international organisations. 
The CBD, which came into force in 1993, expressly recognises the importance 
of indigenous and local knowledge to the conservation and sustainable use of 
biodiversity. The field of ethnobiology had grown during the 1980s, and more 
international organisations had established research programmes on indigenous 
knowledge.32 Its value, both economic and non-economic, was slowly gaining 
recognition. The other event was the inclusion of the Agreement on Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in the package of 
Uruguay Round agreements that were signed by states in 1994. 
</p>
<p>The 1990s saw a complex negotiating agenda evolve amongst states within 
the WTO and the CBD around the issues of the patentability of biological 
materials and the protection of traditional knowledge (the term that came to 
be preferred to indigenous knowledge). International legal instruments have 
dissected traditional knowledge into that related to biological materials and that 
more directly connected to works of art and culture. The latter has acquired 
the terminology traditional cultural expressions.33 The division of traditional 
knowledge into these categories reflects a categorisation analogous to that found 
in IP law. Copyright and expressive uses of trade marks are analogous to traditional 
cultural expressions, and biological materials are associated with patents and

31 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Paris Act, 1971) 1161 UNTS 18388, art 
15(4) recognises folklore as copyright works. The recognition is not dependent on identification of the exact 
author as other copyright protection under the Convention is. However, this is not the same as recognition 
of indigenous knowledge on its own terms; rather it is recognition that it might in some circumstances be 
protected as copyright.

<p>plant variety rights. The concept of traditional knowledge transcends both. This 
sort of categorisation does not necessarily reflect the ways in which indigenous 
peoples see their knowledge. It is no coincidence that biological materials that 
are important to Māori, for example, are frequently found in works of art and 
in carvings on or within buildings. Representations of the distinctive blooms of 
the kōwhai ngutukākā plant are found in the wharewhakairo (carved house) at 
Te Pakirikiri marae. The same representations are also found on Ruatepupuke, a 
meeting house located in the Field Museum in Chicago.34
</p>
<p>The CBD makes it clear that states have sovereignty over their biological 
resources.35 It also requires access to genetic resources to be based on prior 
informed consent and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from those 
resources.36 Patents are, as TRIPS recognises, available for inventions, but not for 
discoveries. Naturally occurring biological resources are not patentable, but can 
be converted into inventions, often through a minimal technical step of isolation 
and purification.37 The conversion of raw biological materials to be found in 
nature into an invention through some minimal intervention can be seen as the 
patent system allowing a form of selective free riding. Further, as we will see in 
section five of this chapter, the idea of raw biological materials existing in nature 
awaiting conversion into inventions by patentees is deeply problematic from 
the perspective of indigenous innovation. As we will see, indigenous people 
in Australia were managing the land with a view to improving the biological 
materials to be found in it. The biodiversity that confronted arriving colonists 
was not that of nature in raw form, but rather the many products of the land 
that had resulted from thousands of years of intervention and management of 
that land by indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>During the early 1990s non-state actors began to point to the unfairness of this 
selective free-riding effect, characterising it as &lsquo;biopiracy&rsquo;.38 Many developing 
states also began to argue that TRIPS undermines the CBD because it requires 
all WTO members to allow for the patentability of micro-organisms and 
microbiological processes and the protection of plant varieties (by means of 
patents or some other system, or some combination thereof).39

</p>
<p>A similar kind of selective free-riding argument can be developed around the 
use of indigenous knowledge. In those cases where indigenous groups have 
maintained their institutions they will, under their customary law systems, be 
able to identify who has ownership and use rights over knowledge. However, 
whether they have IP in that knowledge depends on the application of specific 
rules of protection to be found in the relevant IP system. Under these systems, 
an owner of the indigenous knowledge may not be found because, for example, 
IP systems do not recognise an ancestor as a legal person or because the 
knowledge is regarded as having entered the public domain. There is, however, 
considerable evidence that the willingness of indigenous peoples to share their 
knowledge is not, from their perspective, the equivalent of placing it in the 
public domain.40 TRIPS does not set standards of protection that are specific to 
indigenous knowledge, but because it protects IP rights that utilise traditional 
knowledge, its impact on the holders of that traditional knowledge has been 
considerable. The CBD links the principle of equitable sharing of benefits to the 
use of traditional knowledge.41
</p>
<p>TRIPS and the CBD catalysed the emergence of policy and activist networks 
around the issue of indigenous knowledge and IP. Definitional issues, as the 
next section shows, have loomed large for these networks.
</p>
<p>4. The Quicksands of Definition
</p>
<p>Law is obsessed with definition. Statutes, for example, frequently have a 
definitions section or an interpretation section. Without definitions, the 
discipline of law treats itself as undefined and uncertain. This has contributed to 
a plethora of definitions relating to traditional knowledge. Indigenous peoples 
do not usually attach the same value to abstract definition. If called upon to 
define their traditional knowledge, they will emphasise not the analytical facets 
of knowledge, but rather the relational boundaries and dynamics created by 
the possession of knowledge. This includes indigenous peoples&rsquo; relationship 
with their knowledge, and their responsibility to maintain and develop the 
knowledge for the good of society and future generations. Māori, for example, 
are kaitiaki (guardians) of their knowledge. Additionally, being kaitiaki in part 
defines Māori culture and identity.42

</p>
<p>The disciplines of cognitive anthropology and human ecology in particular have 
been important to recognising folk knowledge as systems of knowledge.43 At first 
the terms &lsquo;indigenous&rsquo; and &lsquo;folk&rsquo; were used interchangeably, and in contrast to 
formalised systems of scientific knowledge. A similar interchangeability of the 
terms is to be found in the study of legal systems, the contrast here being with 
codified or positive systems of law.44 As we noted in section 1 above, the concept 
of an indigenous knowledge system appears in anthropological literature in the 
early 1980s. Within anthropology, the term &lsquo;indigenous&rsquo; comes to be linked 
to cases of distinct tribal groups involved in a rights struggle with a state not 
founded by those groups.45 The meaning of the term is thereby narrowed.
</p>
<p>Within international law, the term &lsquo;indigenous&rsquo; is open ended. The United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (DRIP) avoids proposing 
a definition, stating that indigenous peoples &lsquo;have the right to determine 
their own identity or membership&rsquo;.46 Self-identification appears to be the core 
principle within the UN system for determining the application of the term.47 
This devolutionary strategy may not always help. If being X depends upon a 
right of self-identification as X, and this right is open to all, then it follows that 
anyone may make use of the right to become X. A potential political problem 
arises for states, because being indigenous gives access to a rights-based 
discourse in which the principle of self-determination features prominently. 
Within South-East Asia and South Asia some states such as India, Indonesia and 
Malaysia have attempted to characterise their population at large as indigenous 
and to avoid the use of the term as a descriptor for minority groups such as 
hill tribes.48 Moreover, in these regions, migration patterns, intermarriage and 
cultural cross-pollination make the ascription of indigenous to particular groups 
a matter of debate and complexity.
</p>
<p>UN treaties tend to proliferate rather than restrict meanings in this field. The 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of 1989 draws a distinction between 
tribal and indigenous people. Tribal people are linked to a group that self-
regulates on the basis of custom, while indigenous people are those who existed 
as a group prior to an act of conquest or colonisation and have retained at least 
some of their pre-existing institutions. The CBD refers to &lsquo;indigenous and local

<p>communities&rsquo;. Negotiations within WIPO are aimed at producing an international 
instrument of some kind to protect traditional knowledge. The current draft 
articles take the form of alternative options.49 The term &lsquo;traditional knowledge&rsquo; 
is preferred to &lsquo;indigenous knowledge&rsquo;. The draft options use different terms 
such as &lsquo;indigenous people&rsquo;, &lsquo;local communities&rsquo; and &lsquo;traditional communities&rsquo;. 
It is anyone&rsquo;s guess what the final form of the international instrument will be. 
</p>
<p>Traditional knowledge is perhaps the most open-ended concept that one might 
choose in this field. Some knowledge, argues Polanyi, cannot be specified by 
means of rules and can be passed on only through relationships of close learning 
such as master and apprentice.50 This form of personal knowledge depends on 
tradition. All societies, including capitalist societies, have traditional knowledge.
</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, a range of definitions of traditional knowledge has emerged from 
the literature.51 Traditional knowledge is sometimes linked to environmental or 
ecological knowledge, or to local knowledge held by groups such as farmers and 
fishermen (who may or may not be indigenous). Other definitional strategies 
include contrasting traditional knowledge with scientific knowledge, or 
specifying key properties for it such as oral transmission and its embeddedness 
in a non-materialist cosmology. All definitional strategies run into problems of 
one kind or another. For example, the contrast with science can be overplayed, 
as both traditional knowledge systems and science depend on the making of 
observation statements and testing. Returning to our earlier examples of the 
Wagiman people&rsquo;s knowledge of the calorific and storage properties of damper 
made from the bush palm, and of Māori knowledge of the properties of 
harakeke, it is clear that this kind of knowledge must have involved a process of 
observation and experimentation. 
</p>
<p>Trying to confine traditional knowledge to a class of knowledge (for example, 
ecological knowledge) or a class of people is very difficult. The reason that legal 
definitions place an emphasis on a determinate class of people is not necessarily 
related to the role that knowledge plays in a society, or even what constitutes 
knowledge, but rather it is to attribute rights, or ownership, to that class of 
persons. However, the value of indigenous knowledge sometimes arises because 
of the fact that it is attributable to an open-ended class, as in the case of the 
inter-generational development of plant knowledge: it has a proven pedigree. 
</p>
<p>Traditional knowledge is a potentially widespread phenomenon. For example, 
Mansfield&rsquo;s study of US companies and their foreign direct investment strategies

<p>revealed, amongst other things, that pharmaceutical company employees had 
personal knowledge about chemical processes that their employer companies 
held back as part of their licensing strategies.52 Intimate knowledge about what 
makes a complex chemical process work optimally fits within Polyani&rsquo;s concept 
of personal knowledge, and is exactly the kind of knowledge that is passed on 
through personal training. It is a form of traditional knowledge. In the context of 
an international negotiation, the fact that the concept of traditional knowledge 
has an ever-expanding penumbra of meaning provides states which are minded 
to do so with numerous opportunities to exploit the uncertainty of the concept 
and thus slow down the negotiations of any treaty dealing with the concept. 
</p>
<p>Continuing on with our Wagiman example, both scientists and the Wagiman 
people can agree on the properties of the bush palm, and both will have made 
use of observational methods and testing in arriving at their knowledge of those 
properties. However, if we were to give a full specification of the pathway to 
discovery along which the Wagiman people travelled, we would find it is made 
up of different institutions from those on the pathway travelled by scientists. The 
institutions making up the Wagiman people&rsquo;s pathway might include a totemic 
system of classification in which the identity of some individuals is linked to the 
bush palm, as well as a cosmological system in which the bush palm features as 
a totemic ancestor. By shifting the focus onto an indigenous innovation system 
we can begin to ask about the institutions that form the discovery pathway in 
that system and that need to be supported for the pathway to remain open. IP 
systems may have a supportive function for an indigenous innovation system, 
but without a clear analysis of the institutions that make up this system we will 
not be able to work out which IP systems matter to this function. And once we 
embark on an institutional analysis of indigenous innovation we will also gain 
a better understanding of where IP sits in the lists of priorities for the support 
of indigenous innovation. In the case of Aboriginal people in Australia, the 
place-time nature of their system means that land rights justice is the primary 
necessary first step.53
</p>
<p>Land rights justice, although not completely resolved, is considerably closer 
to having been achieved in New Zealand through the Waitangi Tribunal and 
Treaty settlement process. That may be one reason why Māori were able to 
bring the WAI 262 claim concerning the protection of their knowledge, culture 
and identity to the Waitangi Tribunal.54 This claim shows how progress on 
land rights justice opens the way to progress on the protection of indigenous 
knowledge and culture more broadly.

</p>
<p>An institutional approach also shows that support for indigenous innovation 
will require a multi-level governance approach. The global level of governance 
is the right level at which to be discussing the possibility of a treaty-based 
misappropriation norm for traditional knowledge, but at the state level of 
governance there are clearly many more issues &mdash; such as land rights and 
access to capital &mdash; that must be addressed if states genuinely want to support 
indigenous innovation.
</p>
<p>5. Indigenous Innovation
</p>
<p>Indigenous innovation is place-based innovation. In the case of Aboriginal 
people in Australia, it takes place on &lsquo;Country&rsquo;, a term we explain a little 
later. It is the place where the people observe and interact with the plants and 
animals to which they are cosmologically linked in some way. Their Country is 
their laboratory. The focal point of Māori innovation is also place. Rights over 
resources, and obligations such as that of being kaitiaki, are made concrete by 
being part of a group that is related to a place and is itself integrated into a 
network with human and non-human members (for example, the plants, animals, 
rivers of that place). It is this place-based network that maintains and advances 
knowledge. Individuals can, of course, leave the place of their spiritual affiliation 
and connection (their Country) but remain part of a network, communicating 
with its other members and contributing to its production of knowledge. Place 
anchors indigenous networks of innovation, but these networks can and usually 
do extend beyond place.
</p>
<p>To expand the claim that indigenous innovation is place-based innovation, we 
need to outline the place-time cosmology that underpins this innovation system. 
Indigenous Australians have distinct and systematised beliefs about the true 
nature of the universe. These beliefs continue to exercise a profound influence 
on Aboriginal social organisation, including the organisation of indigenous 
knowledge and innovation systems. The term &lsquo;cosmology&rsquo; does a better job of 
communicating the idea that these beliefs are thought to be true of the world 
than do the English words &lsquo;Dreamtime&rsquo; or &lsquo;Dreaming&rsquo;. The use of Dreamtime 
goes back to a mistranslation of a word from the Aranda language that is better 
translated as &lsquo;eternal, uncreated, springing out of itself&rsquo;.55
</p>
<p>In the broadest terms, these cosmologies deal with a class of eternal events 
involving ancestral beings that remain present in a place.56 One of the features 
</p>
<p>55 T Swain, A Place for Strangers: Towards a History of Australian Aboriginal Being (Cambridge University 
Press, 1993) 21.
56 For more detailed discussions see H Morphy, Ancestral Connections: Art and an Aboriginal System of 
Knowledge (The University of Chicago Press, 1991); Swain, above n 55; F Dussart, The Politics of Ritual in an 
Aboriginal Settlement (Smithsonian Institution Press, 2000).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>of Aboriginal cosmologies is their focus on explaining the origins of the physical 
features of particular areas of the country.57 In these cosmologies ancestral 
beings in either animal or human form will often begin a journey in a specific 
place and end it in another known place. Along the way they will, through the 
exercise of their great powers, transform the landscape to give it the physical 
features by which it is known today. Through their geo-magical powers, the 
ancestors create the topography of an area that clan members come to know as 
their &lsquo;Country&rsquo;. Ancestors also leave behind a landscape that is more propitious 
for the survival of its inhabitants. There are waterholes and freshwater springs, 
names to help classify animal and plant life, as well as useful tools such as fish 
traps and many other things. The features of the landscape are evidence of the 
ancestors&rsquo; travels, with ancestors sometimes leaving behind personal signs such 
as footprints or bodyprints on cave walls. 
</p>
<p>Aboriginal cosmology is not one cosmology made up of an abstract set of truths 
in the canonical form of a text or set of equations. Rather it is many cosmologies 
that speak of great events, events that are made concrete because they are 
embodied in Country. There is no need for written records or archives because 
the land itself holds and displays to the trained knower all the knowledge that 
matters. The land is a living and signalling embodiment of knowledge. Prior 
to the arrival of mining and agricultural technologies, the land would have 
seemed to indigenous people to be the most permanent presence of knowledge 
imaginable. The details of this knowledge are poetically encrypted in stories, 
and transmitted through dance, singing, ritual and story-telling. 
</p>
<p>Country is an emotional centre of being. It is a place that one knows intimately 
at many levels, and in which one has countrymen and rights along with the 
safety and security that these things bring. It is where one can truly &lsquo;sit down&rsquo;.58 
Cosmologies and Countries are indissolubly linked. Different groups of ancestors 
have shaped different areas of land in Australia. Exceptionally powerful totemic 
beings such as the Rainbow Serpent feature in more than one cosmology, but 
the stories in which they feature are not the same story. Ancestral beings are, 
as it were, local rather than universal forces. It follows, for example, that a 
Lardil person from Mornington Island who goes to central Australia where the 
Warlpiri live is not equipped, by virtue of Lardil cosmology, to understand the 
forces that shaped Warlpiri country.

</p>
<p>Māori innovation is also in many ways place based. This is captured in many 
parts of the Ko Aotearoa Tenei: A Report into Claims Concerning New Zealand 
Law and Policy Affecting Māori Culture and Identity (WAI 262), and some of 
those passages are best quoted:
</p>
<p>In the 1,000 years or so in which Māori have lived on the islands of 
Aotearoa, they have developed &mdash; among countless other things &mdash; 
artistic and cultural traditions that are uniquely of this place. The 
underpinnings of these traditions are found in the environment itself &mdash; 
mountains, rivers, sea and sky, plants and animals &mdash; and their expression 
takes many forms, ranging from the architectural achievements of 
the great meeting-house and canoe builders, to the works of weavers, 
carvers, tohunga tā moko, musicians, and the like, as well as in te reo 
Māori, the language itself. These works, founded in and reflecting the 
body of knowledge and understanding known as mātauranga Māori, are 
what we call taonga works. Some of them are ancient, others not, but 
those who are responsible for safeguarding them, whether or not they 
are the original creators of the works, have a very particular relationship 
with them. We call this the kaitiaki relationship.59
</p>
<p>The people who arrived in Aotearoa from Hawaiki some 1,000 years ago 
embedded themselves in the new environment, changed it, and were in 
turn changed by it. Nowhere were these changes more evident than in 
technology and the arts. They reflected the incremental development of 
a new and unique culture. New technologies were required to cultivate, 
hunt, and gather food. New stories and traditions had to be built up to 
explain to succeeding generations why some methods worked and others 
didn&rsquo;t, and why some behaviours were good and others not. Methods 
had to be invented to cultivate and store canoe crops such as taro and 
kūmara in a climate that permitted only one planting cycle per year, and 
traditions were required around those methods to ensure adherence to 
conduct most likely to produce a successful harvest. Unfamiliar plants 
were tested for their utility as food, medicine, fibre, or building material, 
and then catalogued within an entirely newly constructed whakapapa 
(genealogy). As in Hawaiki, this whakapapa had then to be given texture 
and meaning through story and tradition that explained relationships. 
These relationships helped to ensure that the integrity of the catalogue 
could be maintained in memory, and they explained the value (and the 
dangers) of each species, as well as inter-species compatibility. Birds, 
fish, and shellfish were tested and ordered in the same way. This time 
whakapapa, supplemented by story and song, would explain habitat, 
growth cycle, sensitivity to environmental change, and edibility.60

<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>If there is one thing that unites indigenous systems of knowledge it is the 
principle that most or all knowledge that is part of a group&rsquo;s system can be traced 
back to the acts of powerful ancestors. The acts of ancestors are the threads 
that connect different parts of an indigenous knowledge system. One can, for 
example, give independent descriptions of a group&rsquo;s botanical taxonomies, but 
the ultimate origins of these taxonomies lie in the names and classifications that 
ancestral spirits created along with the landscape and the animals and plants in 
it. Indigenous knowledge systems are said to be holistic, but we prefer the term 
&lsquo;connectionist&rsquo;, which better captures the densely networked way in which 
indigenous people in Australia and New Zealand perceive the world.
</p>
<p>Indigenous people are born into social systems that, from the very beginning, 
multiply the number of connections that make up their world. Their kinship 
system links them to places for which they have duties as custodians and 
guardians, as well as to the places of other groups (primarily through inter-
marriage), their ancestors and the events associated with those ancestors. 
Aboriginal societies are sometimes described as kinship societies because no 
individual of a given tribe is left out of a kinship calculation.61 Kinship is 
foundational in Māori society. In the words of the Ko Aotearoa Tenei, kinship is 
&lsquo;a revolving door between the human, physical, and spiritual realms&rsquo;.62
</p>
<p>In this connectionist world plants, animals, rocks, rivers and other things 
have multidimensional natures. A tree may have utilitarian functions, such as 
providing shelter and being a source of medicine, but it may also be linked to 
a person by virtue of a kinship relation because, for example, it features in an 
ancestral story on that person&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s side, leading that person to say that 
&lsquo;this tree is my mother&rsquo;.63 From this kinship connection there may flow a set of 
rights and obligations with respect to a tree species. A very large range of things 
can function as a totem, including plants, animals, wind, rain, thunder, fire, 
mist, tools and food, as well as parts of the human body.64
</p>
<p>We can see even from this brief description that indigenous individuals are 
immersed in a social network that stretches well beyond the conventional 
understanding of a social network, because the units of the network include 
plants and animals and the land itself: &lsquo;The people of a place are related to its 
mountains, rivers and species of plant and animal, and regard them in personal 
terms.&rsquo;65 Connectionism refers to the fact that traditional knowledge systems 
are part of social networks that are characterised by variety in the types of

<p>units in the network, as well as density of connections amongst those units. The 
density of connection comes about because communication with the non-human 
members of the network is seen as possible. Indigenous cosmology, kinship 
systems and totems operate together to create a complex web of relations that 
for the most part remains opaque to outsiders. 
</p>
<p>Before we move on to discuss other features of indigenous innovation, it is 
important to note that states participating in international discussions of 
traditional knowledge and IP have conceptually partitioned IP issues from 
land rights issues. The WAI 262 claim explicitly recognises and articulates the 
importance of the connection to the land and the way in which the relationship 
with the land impacts Māori culture and identity.66 International organisations 
like the WIPO and the WTO focus on IP issues raised by traditional knowledge, 
but stay silent about traditional land rights. Of course, this is exactly what the 
member states of these international organisations want, but it is a partition 
that makes no sense to indigenous people. Their knowledge systems are deeply 
rooted in the place-time relations of land. To protect the former, one must 
recognise rights to the latter. 
</p>
<p>As we have shown, placed-based innovation is integrated with a connectionist 
cosmological scheme in which knowledge is generated as part of a web of 
relations that include ancestors and totemic entities. As one might expect of 
ancient cultures that innovate under conditions of cosmological connectionism, 
many rules and restrictions concerning the use of knowledge have evolved.67 
Indigenous systems of governance for knowledge and innovation do not really 
accommodate the concept of unrestricted public domain rights that characterise 
some IP systems.68 The expiry of patent and copyright terms sees information 
enter the public domain for use by competitors. Within indigenous knowledge 
systems, those with custodial rights over land, plants or animals and the 
knowledge related to those things do not hold those rights for a limited time. 
Potentially this sets up a problem of access to vital resources in indigenous 
societies, and so others are given use rights over resources held by primary 
custodians.69 Kinship relations will be a determining factor in the kind of use 
rights a given individual can gain. In essence, IP systems and indigenous 
governance systems solve access problems to resources in different ways. IP 
systems, with some exceptions such as trade secrets and trade marks, make 
protection time-sensitive, while indigenous systems place the emphasis on 
use rights. In the former, exclusivity of use is offset by limiting the duration

<p>of exclusivity, while in the latter case perpetual rights are offset by granting 
use rights to others. Interestingly, in the case of the perpetual rights allowed 
by systems of trade secret protection and trade marks one can see use-right 
solutions being employed to deal with access issues. For example, trade secret 
protection does not prevent a third party from using information that the party 
has discovered independently of the trade secret holder.
</p>
<p>Another feature of indigenous innovation is the strong presence of uncodified 
knowledge. The information theoretic perspective on innovation draws a distinction 
between codified and uncodifed information, with the latter being best transferred 
by means of personal communication.70 A subset of uncodified information may 
also be uncodifiable in that it cannot be captured by rules. As Polanyi argues, the 
transmission of such knowledge depends on personal teaching and tradition.
</p>
<p>A good example of the role of personal knowledge in indigenous innovation 
is to be found in techniques of fire management. In Arnhem Land, Australia, 
there are areas of land that have been in the hands of traditional custodians 
for many decades, allowing those custodians to use a traditional system of fire 
management.71 In outline, this system is based on a seasonally based method 
of burning. Burning begins in the early dry season, and is first targeted on the 
higher parts of Country where the moisture content of the grass &mdash; which acts 
as a natural control on the extent of the burn &mdash; has fallen. Burning continues 
throughout the dry season, moving into lower areas and reaching a peak in the 
coolest months of the dry season. As groups move about and carry out burning 
on their Countries, a mosaic pattern of burnt and unburnt patches develops. 
The essence of the method is to produce a large number of smaller, cooler fires 
that pose less risk for people and Country. 
</p>
<p>Achieving a &lsquo;cool burn&rsquo; that causes minimal damage to trees and insect life, 
but at the same time stimulates grasses to the right level of re-growth, requires 
an intimate knowledge of how to manage the fire, as well as judgement about 
exactly the right time and conditions under which to burn. The mosaic method 
of burning requires supervision by masters of the method. It is not a matter 
of just strolling into the bush and randomly setting bits of it alight. Standing 
in the bush watching an indigenous man calmly and deliberately start a series 
of fires that culminate in a racing wall of flame makes one realise how much 
depends on accurate judgement about exactly when to start the fire so that it 
will run and stop in a predictable way.72

<p>The ecological value of this innovative technique has slowly been scientifically 
understood. The technique helps to avoid the highly destructive large-scale 
fires that are typical of late-season fires in Northern Australia.73 One study of 
an indigenous estate in north-central Arnhem Land on which this traditional 
method of burning had been more or less continuously used to the present time 
showed that the method promoted ecological integrity as measured by a number 
of indicators such as biodiversity, and the presence of rare native fauna and 
threatened fire-sensitive vegetation types.74
</p>
<p>The rights of Māori to some kind of control over waterways has been recognised 
in New Zealand as part of Māori rights under the Treaty of Waitangi. This has 
led to co-management structures to achieve, amongst other things, conservation 
and sustainable environment goals. In 2010 the Cabinet formed a new policy, 
&lsquo;Involving Iwi75 in Natural Resource Management through Historical Treaty 
of Waitangi Settlements&rsquo;.76 As well as having the goal of settling grievances 
between Māori and the Crown, the aim of the policy is to enable iwi to 
have an effective role in natural resource management, and to create good 
&lsquo;environmental, economic, social and cultural outcomes for iwi and other New 
Zealanders&rsquo;. Co-management can take many forms, ranging from consultation 
through to decision-making powers for Māori. One commentator has described 
co-management as &lsquo;knowledge sharing&rsquo;.77
</p>
<p>The level of Māori control in a co-management arrangement depends on the 
particular Treaty settlement that Māori have negotiated, or the arrangements 
they have made with the local council or that are required under the Resource 
Management Act.78 Co-management arrangements are about far more than the 
settlement of grievances or the avoidance of future grievances. It is increasingly 
recognised that iwi have, both in the past and present, taken good care of New 
Zealand&rsquo;s great outdoors where they have been permitted to do so. The approach 
of Māori to the environment, and their techniques for managing resources, 
contribute to the conservation and sustainability goals of government. The 
Māori approach is a reflection of the relationship between the people and the 
environment, and the interconnectedness of people, the land, and the flora and 
fauna. What creates sustainable practices is the belief that if you harm one aspect

<p>of the environment or those who live in it you harm them all. This approach 
is also found in other indigenous cultures and is reflected in modern discourse 
about sustainability.
</p>
<p>The co-management of the Waikato River, a Māori taonga (treasure), is perhaps 
the best-known example of these arrangements. Co-management followed on 
from a settlement of the historical land claim of the Waikato-Tainui people in 
2007, when the Crown signed the &lsquo;Waikato River Agreement in Principle&rsquo; with 
Waikato-Tainui. A lengthy process of negotiation culminated in the Waikato 
River Settlement Act 2010. Situated in the North Island, the Waikato River is 
New Zealand&rsquo;s longest. Many towns depend on its water, and much industry, 
including electricity generation, is located near it. It once was a very important 
transportation route and the source of plentiful food. The aim of the co-
management arrangement is to restore and protect the health and wellbeing of 
the river for future generations.79 It allows Waikato-Tainui, who have economic 
and cultural relationships with the river, to be actively involved in restoring 
the health of the river. Māori techniques require the &lsquo;incorporation of Māori 
knowledge, cultural and social relationships, and social, cultural, and economic 
wellbeing in an integrated, holistic, and coordinated approach when managing 
the resources of the river&rsquo;.80 The arrangement is still young and its success, or 
otherwise, remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>The WAI 262 report documents some of the impacts Māori have had on the 
environment, and acknowledges that some of these impacts have been damaging. 
But it also explains that Māori customs and practices reached an equilibrium 
with the environment that endured for several hundred years before Europeans 
arrived. The report also describes how Māori selected trees suitable for canoe 
paddles and carving, and how principles that protected the timber resources 
were observed. One witness in the claim gave evidence81
</p>
<p>... about the system for managing native forests, based around strict 
selection and the minimisation of waste. For example, the wood from 
the pāhautea (New Zealand cedar) was both soft and longlasting, and 
was therefore reserved for specific limited uses. Except for making 
paddles and repairing boats, that type of tree would never be cut 
down. &lsquo;We would leave good trees to use for our next paddles.&rsquo; The 
process for selecting the right tree to cut down for carving or other 
purposes was also careful and deliberate. A crucial part of this process 
was the karakia [prayer or incantation] to Tāne-mahuta. Mr Elkington

<p>stated that this karakia was a means of &lsquo;asking for guidance&rsquo; to ensure 
that only the correct tree would be cut down. &lsquo;We did not want to cut 
down the wrong tree, as that would be a waste&rsquo;. This created a system 
for managing native forests based on the kaitiaki relationship. Similar 
systems were in place for the management of kaimoana [seafood]. Priscilla 
Paul and Jim Elkington both referred to the practice of managing and 
transplanting pipi, cockles, mussels, kina, pāua, oyster, and scallops 
for a variety of reasons, including sustainability. Transplantation was 
managed according to the spawning cycles of the various species, and 
traditional regulatory mechanisms such as rāhui [temporary ban, or 
ritual prohibition placed on an area or resource] were used to ensure 
sustainable quantities of kaimoana developed before any harvesting 
took place.
</p>
<p>Another feature of indigenous innovation is the form of its expression. It is 
hard to avoid the pull of a technological artefact view of innovation in which 
new material technologies come to represent the innovative achievements of a 
society. If we look at the technological products of Aboriginal people prior to 
colonisation, they largely consist of the wooden and stone tools and hunting 
implements that are typical of hunter-gatherer societies.82 But different theories 
of innovation illuminate different dimensions of a society&rsquo;s achievements 
in innovation. The information theoretic perspective locates innovation in 
collective processes of generating information to reduce uncertainty.83 A society 
may choose to invest its resources into information that expresses itself more 
in services and processes than in technological artefacts. It may also emphasise 
the symbolic manipulation of information, meaning, amongst other things, that 
more time is devoted to the coding and transmission of information through 
story-telling, dance, ritual, art and other forms of symbolic manipulation. 
For Aboriginal people the sense of cosmologically derived duty to maintain a 
&lsquo;healthy Country&rsquo; is overriding. A great many of their limited resources were 
devoted to generating knowledge and techniques to this end. Healthy Country 
would, at least in the eyes of indigenous people, represent their greatest 
innovative achievement. It would also have been an achievement largely lost 
on the colonists arriving in 1788. Indeed, evidence of Aboriginal peoples&rsquo; 
innovation would have been seen but not recognised by the colonisers on a 
daily basis. Its most obvious presence was the fine-grained habitat produced by 
traditional methods of fire management.84

<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>The innovation output of indigenous societies is best understood at the level 
of systems maintenance, where the systems being maintained are interlocking 
ecological systems and sub-systems. Whether it is using systems of mosaic 
burning to maintain healthy Country or systems to maintain the health of 
waterways, the great contribution to innovation by the indigenous peoples of 
Australia and New Zealand has been in developing systems to maintain the 
healthy functioning of environmental systems. Innovation in terms of new 
technological artefacts has been less of a cultural priority for Aboriginal people. 
</p>
<p>One other aspect of indigenous innovation needs to be mentioned. Some areas of 
innovation such as biotechnology and information technology are said to have a 
high degree of cumulativeness.85 In cumulative innovation, invention X depends 
on invention Y as an input. In a general sense, all innovation is cumulative, 
since no inventor invents every single input that contributes to his invention. 
Models of cumulative innovation operate with a narrow sense of the cumulative, 
looking at the sharing of rents between the first and second innovators and how 
IP rights affect the incentive setting.86 This has limited relevance to innovation 
in the indigenous setting, where it is better to think in terms of cycles of 
innovation dependence. In a cycle of innovation dependence, the use of one 
technique at one point in time allows for the more efficient or innovative use 
of other techniques. For example, the use of fire regimes to improve the quality 
and quantity of plant life offers women, who are often involved in the gathering 
of plants for food and medicines, more opportunities to improve the use of those 
plants. Along similar lines, there is clear evidence that fire regimes also increase 
the efficiency of small-game hunting.87 To maintain the health of a river is also to 
contribute to the maintenance of flora and fauna that depend on the river. In a 
cycle of innovation dependence, one technique or set of techniques acts as part 
of a set of complex conditions that help to promote other forms of innovation. 
The use of fire is not a direct input into the harvesting of a new plant, but it 
is part of a set of causal conditions that helped to promote its growth. Some 
sense of this complex conditionality, of which the apparently simple act (to 
outside observers) of setting fire to the bush is a part, can be glimpsed from the 
following statement: 
</p>
<p>The secret of fire in our traditional knowledge is that it is a thing that 
brings the land alive again. When we do burning the whole land comes 
alive again &mdash; it is reborn. But it is not a thing for people to play with

<p>unless they understand the nature of fire. &hellip; [T]he fire-drive is itself 
regarded as a sacred and very serious act, often first enacted by the 
major creative beings for that area.88
</p>
<p>Summing up, we can see that indigenous innovation has at least the following 
features. It is a place-based form of innovation depending critically on land 
rights for the innovators. The innovative process is deeply integrated into a 
cosmological connectionist scheme in which all innovation has threads leading 
back to ancestors. The diffusion of innovation is dependent upon use rights 
rather than time-limited forms of protection. The innovation system depends 
on the transmission of non-codified personal knowledge. While many rules 
surround the use of knowledge, much of this knowledge has to be learnt 
through personal training rather than rules. Putting it starkly, robots could 
not be programmed through rules to run this place-based innovation system. 
The goals and expression of innovation have less to do with products and 
everything to do with services to Country. Resources are devoted to innovation 
in systems maintenance, rather than to the generation of technological artefacts. 
This systems maintenance means that indigenous innovators operate in cycles 
of innovation dependence. There is a time for burning Country so that the 
efficiency of other techniques and practices can be improved upon.
</p>
<p>6. Indigenous Innovation and IP Pathways to 
Development
</p>
<p>What role, then, for IP rights in systems of indigenous innovation? It should be 
clear from the preceding discussion that IP rights cannot be the prime mover 
of indigenous innovation systems. Rather, indigenous innovation is driven 
by that complex web of relations that we have argued lies in the cosmological 
connectionism of indigenous peoples. Cosmological connectionism anchors 
indigenous networks to places and creates relationships of caring about those 
places. 
</p>
<p>In Australia, it is on Country that Aboriginal people can maintain or rebuild the 
institutions that support their own distinctive path to discovery. It is on Country 
that elders have the best chance of passing on their personal knowledge in ways 
that will switch on young indigenous minds to distinctive ways of observing 
and understanding the land and its plants and animals. Without the on-Country 
experience, building a distinctive indigenous human capital with the capability

</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>to follow indigenous paths of discovery seems a slim prospect. The principle of 
co-management of resources, which we discussed earlier in the context of the 
management of New Zealand&rsquo;s rivers, is a regulatory principle that opens the 
door to indigenous innovation.
</p>
<p>The systems of indigenous innovation that are being developed on Country are 
a mix of old and new ways of working. The cosmological framework and the 
duties to Country that it imposes remain invariable, but obviously there are new 
tools and new networks to help in the execution of those duties &mdash; helicopters 
to reach the remotest areas to do burning, software and data management 
technologies to help organise the detailed observational knowledge of Country, 
and networks with scientists and research institutions. Quietly some indigenous 
communities in Australia&rsquo;s north are building new capabilities with which to 
drive their innovation system. In chapter two of this book, David Claudie, 
Susan Semple, Nicholas Smith and Bradley Simpson show what is possible when 
indigenous innovators and scientists, each with their own path to discovery, 
build a common network and join their paths at the level of testing and 
observation. If indigenous people want to bring their innovations to markets 
beyond their customary ones, the networked cooperation between indigenous 
innovators and scientists described by Claudie, Semple, Smith and Simpson will 
be important. 
</p>
<p>But this also means that the locus of indigenous innovation will have to shift into 
a network where there are non-indigenous participants who do not see the world 
in terms of cosmological connectionism, at least not of the kind subscribed to by 
indigenous peoples. In chapter three, Jen Cleary shows that that is a frightening 
prospect for indigenous peoples. The participatory action research method she 
describes is a tool for forging these broader networks in ways that enhance 
indigenous peoples&rsquo; chances of achieving respectful cooperation.
</p>
<p>Much of the land controlled by Aboriginal people is characterised by ecological 
intactness and high biodiversity value.8 9 The practical problem facing 
indigenous communities in many places is that their innovation takes the form of 
services to the land that have clear public good benefits in terms of biodiversity, 
and environmental and climate values that are difficult to turn into income 
streams. Biological diversity, for example, has an economic value. Importantly, 
it is the stock of biodiversity, rather than individual plants, that is the source 
of this value.90 Maintaining that stock is precisely the area of innovation in 
which indigenous systems excel. However, patent and plant variety protections

<p>allow only for the extraction of economic value from a particular product that 
meets the criteria of these systems (for example, the criteria of patentability 
for an invention). If market-based solutions to public good problems cannot be 
found, then the standard move is to argue that government must pay for the 
provision of these goods. This means government making income transfers to 
indigenous people for providing environmental services. This, of course, means 
that government must be willing to meet the fiscal and political cost of making 
those transfers. 
</p>
<p>So far we have been talking as if IP has no or little role in the support of 
indigenous innovation systems. However, this is not our position. As Tony 
Taubman has pointed out, the benefits of using conventional IP mechanisms 
to protect indigenous knowledge should not be overlooked.91 What IP can or 
cannot do for a given indigenous community is always context dependent. 
All the chapters in this book suggest that IP pathways to development might 
be organically constructed to suit the circumstances of a given indigenous 
community. However, the experience of indigenous peoples in Australia and 
New Zealand suggests that for the benefits of IP to be fully realised, particular 
conditions need to be met. The most crucial condition is progress on land 
rights. Once indigenous groups recover control of place, the process of creating 
networks to take care of place can begin. Once indigenous groups have networks 
in place, they can begin to enrol other actors and networks into their own to 
assist innovation that respects their institutions of cosmological connectionism. 
Chapter two in essence describes the evolution of this model of innovation. In 
chapter four, Daniel Robinson also provides examples of how indigenous and 
non-indigenous researchers can join together as an innovation network.
</p>
<p>It is also clear from the Australian and New Zealand experience that indigenous 
peoples will have to work with existing institutions of IP. As we saw at the 
beginning of this chapter, the Australian High Court has signalled that a native 
title system of IP is not likely to form part of the common law&rsquo;s recognition of 
native title rights and interests. Similarly in New Zealand, the recommendations 
of the Waitangi Tribunal on the 262 claim signal an integrative approach of 
reasonable reform of IP rights over traditional knowledge. Its summary of 
its recommendations concerning the controversial issue of IP regulation of 
biological resources is emblematic of its general approach: &lsquo;All the reforms we 
recommend in this chapter can operate within the existing frameworks around 
bioprospecting, GM, and IP.&rsquo;92

</p>
<p>Modest incremental reform will not please everyone, but in chapter nine 
Miranda Forsyth suggests that new model laws may not solve very much 
and may open the door to destructive political contests amongst indigenous 
communities. Perhaps an implication of her argument is that more problems may 
be solved by bargaining in the shadow of imperfect IP laws than by attempting 
to radically rewrite them. The dissatisfied critic might reasonably reply that 
indigenous groups do not have enough bargaining power to secure the outcomes 
they want. But to some extent rules can be written that increase the negotiating 
power of indigenous groups when it comes to the use of their knowledge 
assets. The law, by creating veto rights over the use of such assets in certain 
circumstances, forces a negotiation that would otherwise not have occurred. 
The recommendations of the Waitangi Tribunal move in this general direction. 
For example, the Tribunal recommends the creation of a Māori Committee to 
work with the Commissioner of Patents on patent applications that affect Māori 
interests. The Tribunal also recommends the creation of a disclosure obligation 
for patent applicants where they have used Māori knowledge or species, with 
the possibility of patent invalidity for non-disclosure. Building these kinds of 
veto rights into IP law means that real risks attach to not entering into a process 
of negotiation with indigenous groups. States that are interested in fostering 
indigenous development networks should look to regulatory strategies that 
provide incentives for outsiders to negotiate with indigenous groups, and 
that give indigenous groups some bargaining power in those negotiations. A 
negotiation is an opportunity for trust to form between the parties, and it is 
deep trust, as Jen Cleary suggests, that will be needed in collaborations between 
indigenous and non-indigenous innovators. 
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, IP rights can be divided into those that confer origination 
rights over a product (for example, patents and plant variety protection) and 
those which confer rights to distinguish a product in commerce (for example, 
trade marks, certification marks and geographical indications). Taken together, 
the chapters in this book suggest that indigenous peoples are most likely to 
build IP development pathways using systems that confer rights to distinguish 
their product in the marketplace. For reasons that Daphne Zografos Johnsson 
outlines in chapter seven, these systems do not offer indigenous groups 
comprehensive protection. They were, after all, not designed by them, but 
emerge out of capitalist economies. Still, the rise of ethical consumerism offers 
the possibility of linking products and services of indigenous innovation with 
consumers who are willing to pay a premium for those services and products. 
Every day millions of consumers around the world pay more for products that 
bear the fairtrade certification mark of the Fairtrade Labelling Organizations 
International because the mark represents a system made up of standards 
and fairtrade prices aimed at promoting the sustainable development of poor 
producers in developing countries. The evolution of this system in the context </p>

</p>
<p>of protected agricultural markets and complex multinational supply networks 
is a remarkable story.93 Along similar lines, one can imagine consumers being 
willing to pay for products produced on Country under indigenous fire 
management practices that helped to reduce Australia&rsquo;s carbon emissions.94 In 
chapter five Christoph Graber and Jessica Lai draw together the lessons from 
the failure of Australia&rsquo;s national certification scheme for indigenous products, 
and present the case for why a globally recognised certification scheme might 
be the way forward. 
</p>
<p>The use of geographical indications (GIs) in the context of indigenous innovation 
is perhaps less obvious, given that they are less flexible than voluntary 
certification systems. But in chapter six Daniel Gervais builds an eloquent case 
for the possibilities. If GIs are to have a Foucaldian moment of creation in which 
they truly serve the indigenous collective, then it will have to be along the lines 
for which he argues.95 In chapter eight Michael Blakeney reminds us of the 
hard geo-political trade reality of IP. He shows the connections between the EU 
agenda on GIs and its broader trade agenda on agriculture. His chapter is also 
a reminder that so much IP standard-setting now takes place in the crucible of 
trade agreements &mdash; a crucible that is hard for indigenous groups to penetrate 
and influence. One wonders, for example, whether Australia&rsquo;s trade negotiators 
consulted indigenous people in the context of the US&ndash;Australia Free Trade 
Agreement.
</p>
<p>This opening chapter has suggested that a commodity regime like the patent 
system does not fit particularly well with innovation in systems that characterise 
much of indigenous innovation. For example, the techniques of indigenous fire 
management have a wide range of ecological benefits, including the reduction 
of carbon emissions through the reduced severity of late-season savannah fires 
in Northern Australia.96 Capturing the value that these techniques generate 
depends more on government catalysing carbon markets in ways that allow 
for indigenous participation than it does on one indigenous group embarking 
on the fruitless task of trying to gain a monopoly over a method of burning

Movement (Edward Elgar, 2009).

Fair Trade in Australia: Scoping Study (Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation Publication

study that shows the intensive networking demands of GIs see D Rangnekar, &lsquo;Geographical Indications and 
Localisation: A Case Study of Feni&rsquo; (Research Report, Economic and Social Research Council, The University 
of Warwick, 2009). A GI system can have a lock-in effect when it comes to traditional methods of production, 
acting as an incentive against innovation. See W van Caenegem, &lsquo;Registered Geographical Indications:

<p>that has been collectively practised by indigenous people in Australia for 
thousands of years. Moreover, in the unlikely event that a single group was 
able to persuade a busy patent examiner in the Australian patent office that this 
really was an invention and not part of the prior art, the grant of such a patent 
would be the worst possible outcome for both indigenous and non-indigenous 
Australians. Other indigenous groups would ask why one group should gain a 
monopoly over techniques that had been collectively developed and practised 
by indigenous people for such a long time. The patent system is a winner-take-
all system that has huge potential to divide indigenous communities. Daniel 
Robinson&rsquo;s discussion of biopiracy in chapter four shows how the patent system 
struggles to maintain standards of novelty and inventiveness that meaningfully 
engage with innovation. Some indigenous people may, of course, want to take 
advantage of these low standards to obtain patents for themselves, but they are 
likely more often than not to be the victims rather than the beneficiaries of the 
patent system&rsquo;s low standards. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing for indigenous innovation is to make 
&lsquo;indigenous innovation&rsquo; rather than traditional knowledge the primary term 
of art in this field. Then policy-makers would have to start asking how they 
might support indigenous innovation, as opposed to dividing the spoils from 
traditional knowledge. Answering that question would lead to others. How 
might we encourage collaboration between cosmologically anchored indigenous 
networks and scientific networks? How might we intervene in the IP system 
to increase the bargaining power of indigenous innovators? What can we do 
to turn indigenous networks into development networks? One suspects this 
approach would lead to a more testing but ultimately richer world for science, 
and a better world for indigenous people in which they would gain the respect 
that comes from being seen as innovators.</p>

<p>1. Introduction
</p>
<p>Since European arrival, indigenous peoples of Australia have suffered from the 
effects of chronic social, political and economic disadvantage. The statistics 
on health outcomes and life expectancy remain tragic and unacceptable. Data 
published in 2008 indicates that indigenous Australians have a life expectancy 
some 17 years lower than the national average, are hospitalised at twice the rate 
of non-indigenous Australians, and are twice as likely to report high or very 
high levels of psychological distress.1 The social disadvantage of indigenous 
peoples is reflected in low rates of literacy and school completion, and high 
rates of unemployment, violence, suicide, drug abuse and imprisonment.2
</p>
<p>Disruption of traditional law and governance systems, disempowerment, denial 
of land rights and forced removal of people from their traditional country or 
homelands are recognised as important factors contributing to poor health 
and welfare outcomes for indigenous peoples.3 Some indigenous writers have 
highlighted the importance of relationships with land and its associated natural 
resources to indigenous health and wellbeing.4
</p>
<p>Through sustainable indigenous natural resource management and development 
on their homelands, the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation, the organisation

<p>driving the research described in this chapter, is working to improve social and 
economic outcomes for the Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Northern Kaanju families it represents. It 
is also seeking to gain wider recognition by mainstream agencies of indigenous 
management and governance structures. Research on the medicinal and aromatic 
plants of the Kuuku I&rsquo;yu5 is one aspect of the corporation&rsquo;s overall natural 
resource management plan. 
</p>
<p>In this chapter we describe our approach to medicinal plant research 
(incorporating both indigenous and Western scientific perspectives) and some of 
the issues around this field of research. We include the perspectives of particular 
Kuuku I&rsquo;yu families living on homelands through the traditional owner and 
chair of the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation (David Claudie) and scientists 
in ethnobotany (Nicholas Smith) and ethnopharmacology (Susan Semple and 
Bradley Simpson). We envisage that culturally appropriate development of 
medicinal plant products will contribute to improved opportunities for Kuuku 
I&rsquo;yu people to live and work on homelands. This will also allow younger people 
to engage with and learn about natural resources on their homelands, and provide 
an alternative to life in centralised townships. For university-based researchers, 
this project has provided a unique opportunity to work closely with indigenous 
traditional owners in the study of their medicinal plants, and to learn about the 
uses and stories associated with these plants, and traditional understandings 
of the ways these plant medicines work. Furthermore, the project has allowed 
Western scientific investigation of the medicinal actions and components of a 
number of plant species for the first time.
</p>
<p>2. Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Homelands, Traditional Governance 
and the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation 
</p>
<p>The Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Northern Kaanju homelands are centred on the upper Wenlock 
and Pascoe Rivers in Central Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, and encompass 
an area of approximately 840,000 hectares (Figure 1). Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people living 
on these homelands recognise the traditional Aboriginal law and governance 
system for this &lsquo;Country&rsquo;. In this system the Country is divided into different 
clan estates (named Ngaachi), each tied to a particular &lsquo;bloodline&rsquo; or family6 
and to a particular traditional &lsquo;story&rsquo;.7 For the Northern Kaanju people living

<p>at Chuulangun on Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Ngaachi, indigenous cosmology ties land, flora, 
fauna and people. The landscape was shaped by ancestral beings or &lsquo;stories&rsquo; that 
left law (or governance) and language.

</p>
<p>These Ngaachi or homelands have a huge diversity of flora and fauna, including 
several rare, threatened and endangered species.8 As the traditional owners, the Kuuku 
I&rsquo;yu people have a broad and in-depth knowledge of the ecology of these homelands 
and their associated natural resources. This knowledge includes information about 
the identification and description of species and habitats, and detailed knowledge of 
their uses for a variety of purposes including foods and medicines, species behaviour 
and distribution, seasonal variation, the effects of fire, and sacred information. 
Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people also have their own system of natural resource management based 
on traditional governance systems.9 &lsquo;Management&rsquo;, to Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people, means 
the interwoven complex of ownership, use and nurturance inherent in Aboriginal 
peoples&rsquo; relationship to the Country.10
</p>
<p>In 2002, the descendants of a focal11 Kuuku I&rsquo;yu ancestor who were living on 
homelands at Chuulangun formed the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation 
under the Commonwealth Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 
&mdash; an Act recently superseded by the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander) Act 2006 (Cwealth). The corporation can be described as a 
contemporary extension of traditional governance structures.12 The &lsquo;bloodlines&rsquo; 
that tie people to different tracts of land are the foundation of indigenous 
governance, knowledge, land tenure and land management. This philosophy 
drives the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation in its efforts towards sustainable 
land management, ecological and socio-cultural restoration, and the reaffirmation 
of indigenous knowledge across the Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Ngaachi. 
</p>
<p>To facilitate this development the corporation has developed a comprehensive 
land and natural resource management plan in keeping with traditional 
responsibilities to Country.13 Key goals include:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 reaffirming Kuuku I&rsquo;yu governance, land and resource management, and 
decision-making on Northern Kaanju homelands;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 protecting the indigenous and natural heritage values on Northern Kaanju 
homelands for the benefit of current and future generations of Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 supporting Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people to re-occupy their homelands on a more 
permanent basis;

community, and lead to meaningful employment which is culturally linked;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 incorporating, where appropriate, traditional knowledge with Western 
scientific processes to provide beneficial outcomes for natural and cultural 
resource management policy and practice.
</p>
<p>Since 2008, part of the KuukuI&rsquo;yu homelands has been recognised as an 
Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) under the National Reserve System.14 This was 
the first IPA declared in Cape York. Under this programme, the Chuulangun 
Aboriginal Corporation is supported by government to manage a large part of 
the Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Northern Kaanju Ngaachi for conservation.
</p>
<p>The Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Northern Kaanju medicinal plants project described in this 
chapter forms just one part of the overall programme of homeland activities 
developed by the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation.15 However, this project 
seeks to contribute to a number of the key goals listed above. These include impacts 
on the development of homelands-based community enterprises, sustainable use 
of resources, training, improved self-determination and self-esteem for Kuuku 
I&rsquo;yu people, the incorporation of Western scientific approaches, and the transfer 
and preservation of traditional knowledge. Furthermore, through this project 
the corporation seeks to add to discussions at the national and international 
level around the development of improved mechanisms to ensure the protection 
of the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>To understand some of the innovation of the approach to this research, it is 
important to describe the context in which the majority of Western scientific 
research on medicinal plants used in traditional medicine is conducted.

<p>3. &lsquo;Use&rsquo; of Traditional Medicinal Plant 
Knowledge by Western Science
</p>
<p>Traditional knowledge about medicinal plants has long been recognised as a 
useful guide for scientists working in the Western tradition concerned with the 
discovery of new medicines.16 There are many examples of Western medicines 
that have their origins in plants used in traditional medicine: the painkillers 
morphine and aspirin, the anti-malarial medicine artemisinin, the anti-cancer 
agent teniposide, and the cardiac medicine digoxin. In recent years there 
has also been a growing trend amongst the general population in Western 
countries, including Australia,17 towards using herbal and other &lsquo;natural&rsquo; 
medicines (sometimes termed complementary medicines18). Many of the 
widely used herbal medicines have long histories of traditional use: echinacea 
(from Native American medicine), ginseng and ginkgo (from Asian medicine 
systems, including traditional Chinese medicine) and pygeum bark (used by 
traditional healers in Africa). Consequently, there has been, and continues to 
be, considerable interest in the Western scientific investigation of plants used in 
various systems of traditional medicine.
</p>
<p>The fields of Western scientific research concerned with the study of traditional 
uses and pharmacological activities of plants include ethnobotany and 
ethnopharmacology. Ethnobotany involves the examination and documentation 
of the relationships between plants and traditional peoples,19 including 
the uses of plants for purposes such as medicines. Ethnopharmacology is 
a multidisciplinary field that has been defined as the description of plants 
and other natural resources used in traditional medicine, and the scientific 
investigation of their medicinal activities and chemical constituents.20 This 
research has primarily been undertaken with the goal of discovering new 
medicines or understanding the actions and efficacy of traditional medicine 
through the lens of Western scientific enquiry.
</p>
<p>In the last decade, authors in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology (the major 
international journal for the field) and other publications have examined the

18 Complementary medicines include a variety of medicinal substances including plant (herbal) medicines, 
homeopathic medicines, aromatherapy oils, dietary supplements, and vitamins and minerals. See Expert 
Committee on Complementary Medicines in the Health System &lsquo;Complementary Medicines in the Australian 
Health System&rsquo; (Report to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Canberra, 
Commonwealth of Australia, 2003). The word &lsquo;complementary&rsquo; is used to indicate that these are medicines 
and practices used outside of mainstream Western medical care, but that may complement it.

<p>definitions, roles and future of ethnopharmacology.21 In their critical review 
of the field, Etkin and Elisabetsky have highlighted that much of what is 
published as ethnopharmacological research focuses only on Western scientific 
understandings of traditional medicinal plants. They argue that research in this 
field often consists of published lists of traditional medicinal plants tested in 
a laboratory for a particular medicinal activity (such as anti-bacterial activity) 
and examination of the constituents of the plants with particular activities to 
identify the active components. While most of this is scientifically rigorous 
research, it fails to address the social and political implications of the findings. 
Very little of this research reflects an interest &lsquo;in the people whose knowledge and 
identity are embodied in these plants&rsquo; or offers any insights into the experiences 
of these people &lsquo;in specific cultural and eco-political settings&rsquo;.22
</p>
<p>When one examines the drivers of ethnopharmacological and ethnobotanical 
research and the authors of published papers on this research, the overwhelming 
majority are scientists working in universities, other scientific research 
institutions or pharmaceutical companies. For the most part they, along with 
their institutions, are also the beneficiaries of this research (in terms of grants, 
publications, patents or new products).23
</p>
<p>Over the past decade there has been increasing international recognition of 
the need for scientists and companies working in the field of medicinal plant 
research to ensure that indigenous communities benefit from the investigation 
and development of their traditional medicinal knowledge and to develop 
models for the equitable sharing of benefits of this research.24
</p>
<p>While benefit-sharing agreements are certainly a step in the right direction, we 
argue that there is a need to further develop models of research on medicinal 
plants that is locally initiated and driven by indigenous peoples as part of their

<p>own planning for sustainable natural resources management and economic 
development. Furthermore, indigenous peoples need to have the rights and 
legal mechanisms to protect their own cultural and intellectual property.
</p>
<p>It is now widely recognised that projects in indigenous communities that are 
locally run, locally owned and culturally relevant will deliver more meaningful 
outcomes. However, most research on traditional Australian indigenous 
medicinal plants has been, and continues to be, driven and published by 
scientists working in the Western tradition.25 They may have drawn on published 
information about indigenous peoples&rsquo; knowledge, or have used information 
provided by indigenous people who are otherwise bystanders in the actual 
research processes. We argue that those engaged in research on medicinal plants 
need to move beyond using indigenous peoples as &lsquo;informants&rsquo;. Indigenous 
peoples must become researchers, and share in the benefits of research.

</p>
<p>The remoteness and biodiversity and natural heritage significance of the Kuuku 
I&rsquo;yu homelands have been the subject of considerable research interest over 
many years. Numerous papers, theses, books, reports and museum artefacts 
are devoted to aspects of the indigenous people and their homelands. More 
recently, however, many Kuuku I&rsquo;yu traditional owners have been reluctant to 
participate in research. This is due largely to the past experience of Kuuku I&rsquo;yu 
elders who took part in research activities initiated by &lsquo;outsiders&rsquo;, and shared 
their language and traditional ecological knowledge with them, but felt they 
received very little in return for their efforts. Today, traditional owners continue

their homelands without their knowledge or consent. 
</p>
<p>The diverse natural resources of Kuuku I&rsquo;yu homelands and the detailed 
traditional ecological knowledge held by its people represent a huge 
opportunity for the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation to address issues of 
social disadvantage, economic hardship and loss of connection amongst their 
people, and to sustain them into the future. To achieve this, the Corporation has 
taken actions to ensure that the people now initiate, manage and benefit from 
research on and about their homelands.
</p>
<p>David Claudie, chair of the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation, has undertaken 
to &lsquo;research the researchers&rsquo;. This has included a comprehensive literature search 
and review of published papers and other unpublished materials produced by 
&lsquo;outside&rsquo; researchers about Kuuku I&rsquo;yu homelands and associated resources. 
This has allowed traditional owners to better understand what research has 
already been undertaken on their land, and to direct development of further 
programmes of research.

<p>The Corporation has also developed guidelines and protocols that must be 
observed by outsiders wanting to undertake research on Kuuku I&rsquo;yu homelands 
and with Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people. These guidelines emphasise the need for research 
projects to be collaborations underpinned by Memorandums of Understanding, 
and with the aim to protect Kuuku I&rsquo;yu intellectual property (IP) rights and 
involve traditional owners as &lsquo;initiators and full collaborators in research&rsquo;.26
</p>
<p>As part of their land and natural resource management planning,27 the 
Corporation has developed priority areas for research which will facilitate 
development of Kuuku I&rsquo;yu homelands, while still allowing traditional 
obligations to the land to be met. Some of this research is being conducted 
by Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people themselves, whilst other research has required strategic 
partnerships with outside agencies such as government, universities and non-
government organisations.
</p>
<p>(b) Starting the Medicinal Plants Project
</p>
<p>Development of a locally driven management plan for natural resources enabled 
relevant Kuuku I&rsquo;yu traditional owners to invite Western scientific collaborators 
to work with them in areas they had prioritised in terms of their traditional 
</p>

<p>38
</p>
<p>medicines and aromatic plants. Moreover, traditional owners were able to work 
as collaborating researchers in the research process itself, rather than being 
&lsquo;stakeholders&rsquo; or &lsquo;informants&rsquo; and bystanders to the actual research process.
</p>
<p>Nick Smith had been working with the corporation for two years, documenting 
and mapping plant species on Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Northern Kaanju homelands with 
traditional owners. Other university-based researchers at the University of 
South Australia were invited to join the team, based on their experience in 
testing and analysing medicinal plants and medicinal product development. 
</p>
<p>(c) Project Aims
</p>
<p>Discussions between Kuuku I&rsquo;yu and university-based researchers before 
starting the project examined the aspirations of Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people in respect 
of the study and development of their traditional medicinal plants. University-
based researchers provided advice on the types of laboratory investigations that 
would be feasible and the legislative requirements for plant-based medicines 
to be sold as medicinal plant products. Key objectives for the research were 
formulated. These included:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 investigation of extracts from medicinal plant species to assist community 
members to determine opportunities for developing economic enterprises 
based on sustainable use of plant products;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 investigation of the chemical composition and toxicology of the plant extracts 
demonstrating the most interesting pharmacological activities as determined 
by the research team;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 providing opportunities for Kuuku I&rsquo;yu and university-based researchers 
and students to visit different research sites (homelands and university);
</p>
<p>&bull;	 supporting Kuuku I&rsquo;yu elders to engage with younger people on homelands, 
and help transfer language and medicinal plant knowledge to younger 
generations through the harvesting of plant material and preparation of 
traditional plant extracts for the project;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 dissemination of information about research processes and findings through 
collaborative publications between Kuuku I&rsquo;yu and university-based 
researchers.
</p>
<p>(d) Establishing Ways of Working &mdash; Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Traditional 
Knowledge in the Project and How It May Be Used
</p>
<p>Before starting the project, participants planned how they would work together. 
This included discussion of the key issues of how Kuuku I&rsquo;yu traditional 
knowledge about plants should be used, and how this cultural and intellectual 
property should be protected.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2 . Ancient but New
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>For Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people, knowledge of the ecology of their traditional homelands 
is based on many thousands of years of empirical observations and sustainable 
land and resource use and management. This knowledge has been passed 
down through particular Kuuku I&rsquo;yu bloodlines to the current generation of 
traditional owners, managers and lawmakers living on homelands. Underlying 
this immense body of knowledge is a cosmological world view in which Kuuku 
I&rsquo;yu people &lsquo;belong&rsquo; to the land and are under the management of ancestral 
beings that formed the land and its associated resources. These ancestral beings 
are also the &lsquo;source&rsquo; of particular knowledge.
</p>
<p>There are rules for management and use of this traditional knowledge. For 
instance, some knowledge is freely available (public knowledge), some knowledge 
and information belongs to the realm of the restricted (sacred knowledge), and 
other knowledge and information falls into a category between public and 
sacred. Further, Kuuku I&rsquo;yu governance and cosmology determine who can have 
access to knowledge. That is, only authorised persons can have access to sacred 
knowledge and can decide how it is used.
</p>
<p>Only certain people have access to medicinal plant knowledge and are authorised 
to use such knowledge. This knowledge includes the uses of a particular plant, 
the location(s) where the plant should be collected, the maturity of the plant 
and the time of year at which it can be used, how the plant product is harvested, 
how the medicine is prepared, and how and to whom the medicine may be 
administered. Understanding who speaks for the land and who is authorised 
to use knowledge about the plants is critical to the working of the medicinal 
plants project. These authorised people decide what knowledge is appropriate 
to be shared in the project, how it is used, which medicines may be tested in the 
laboratory and what they may be tested for.
</p>
<p>(e) Collaborative Research Agreement 
</p>
<p>It was central to our research that a clearly negotiated collaborative research 
agreement must be in place before commencement of the project. This agreement 
had to ensure the protection of indigenous IP, confidentiality, and a mechanism 
for benefit sharing if any commercialisation results from the jointly generated 
project IP. The agreement had to allow Kuuku I&rsquo;yu law and custom to dictate 
how traditional knowledge would be used in the course of the project, and 
for traditional owners to maintain control over any decisions to proceed with 
commercialisation of IP.
</p>
<p>The Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation and university-based researchers 
worked together to produce a research collaboration and IP agreement. The 
agreement incorporated relevant aspects of standard agreements between the 
University of South Australia and industry partners, but required special </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>recognition and protection of the cultural and intellectual property of Kuuku 
I&rsquo;yu participants and culturally appropriate ways of working. Drafts of the IP 
agreement were shared, with each party making comments and contributions to 
define their understanding of each of the following project areas:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 work and funding commitments;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 protection of indigenous cultural and IP rights;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 confidentiality;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 publication of research findings;
</p>
<p>&bull;	 ownership and utilisation of IP generated through the project.
</p>
<p>The final agreement was reviewed and approved by the Human Research Ethics 
Committee of the University of South Australia.
</p>
<p>Relevant documents such as the National Health and Medical Research Council 
(NHMRC) &lsquo;Values and Ethics: Guidelines for Ethical Conduct in Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander Health Research&rsquo;28 and general guidelines for responsible 
research practice29 were considered by the research team in the drafting of 
the agreement. However, the emphasis was on recognising members of the 
Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation as drivers of the research process and as 
researchers in their own right. This meant that while it was necessary to comply 
with national research guidelines, local indigenous lore also dictated how the 
project would be conducted. The NHMRC Guidelines are based on six key 
values which the team agrees are crucial to the conduct of collaborative research 
between universities and Aboriginal peoples &mdash; namely &lsquo;Spirit and Integrity; 
Reciprocity; Respect; Equality; Survival and Protection; Responsibility&rsquo;.30 
However, the guidelines talk about &lsquo;researchers&rsquo; or the &lsquo;research community&rsquo; on 
one hand and &lsquo;Aboriginal and Torres Strait peoples&rsquo; on the other. For our team, 
the Aboriginal people represented by the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation 
are also the researchers.

is given in Box 1.

</p>
<p>Box 1. Key Aspects of the Collaborative Project Agreement
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Recognition of the values of traditional knowledge is central to the research 
project.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people&rsquo;s participation will bring to the project valuable IP in 
the form of traditional knowledge about plants of cultural significance. This 
background IP remains in the ownership of traditional owners and is fully 
acknowledged in the allocation of any new IP generated through the project.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Cultural and intellectual property of traditional owners is treated as 
confidential information that will not be disclosed to any third party.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Indigenous law and custom govern how background IP will be used during 
the course of the project. 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Traditional owners will undertake plant collections for the project in 
accordance with the rights of certain people to prepare medicines under 
customary law.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 New IP developed through the project (such as findings of laboratory-
based testing and chemical analysis) is jointly and equally owned by 
Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation and the University of SA.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Decisions to commercialise any aspects of project IP will require the consent 
of both parties. Both parties will work together in making decisions about 
the processes of any commercialisation.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 There will be an emphasis on joint publication of research findings by 
both university-based and Kuuku I&rsquo;yu researchers contributing to relevant 
aspects of the work.
</p>
<p>(f) Approaches to Activities Undertaken in the Project
</p>
<p>(i) Collection of plant materials
</p>
<p>Collection and preparation of plant materials to be laboratory tested in the 
project took place during collaborative field work involving both university-
based researchers and Kuuku I&rsquo;yu researchers. Only traditional owners with 
authorisation could prepare traditional medicines, lead the field work to collect 
the plant materials, or instruct other researchers on what and where to collect 
it. Inappropriate collection by the wrong person, collecting the wrong plant or 
entering the wrong part of the Country to collect it would be seen by traditional 
owners to make the medicine either not work or to do harm. Traditional owners 
say that the medicinal plant needs to &lsquo;pass through our hands&rsquo; to work in the 
correct manner. In the past, this has been a source of concern for traditional 
owners when &lsquo;outsiders&rsquo; have collected plants from homelands for testing in 
laboratories without their knowledge or consent.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>Western scientific disciplines such as ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology 
require the use of voucher specimens of plants. Voucher specimens are reference 
specimens for a particular plant collection that are usually archived in a 
nationally recognised institution such as a state herbarium. This ensures the 
specimen is available to other members of the scientific community, and that 
the specimen is maintained and curated appropriately. Publication of the results 
of Western scientific research on medicinal plants in reputable peer-reviewed 
journals requires that a voucher specimen has been lodged and that the unique 
voucher number is published. In our project we have lodged voucher specimens 
for all the collections with herbaria. However, the public availability of these 
voucher specimens does present some issues for traditional custodians of the 
plants. When lodging the specimen for our study, some information about the 
plant was restricted and no information about traditional uses was recorded on 
the specimen. Specimens were linked to the particular clan estates on which 
they were collected, and the rightful traditional custodian of the plant was 
recorded as the plant collector. However, once specimens have been lodged in 
a herbarium, it is currently difficult for traditional owners to maintain control 
over what happens to them. Our research team is concerned that most herbaria 
can split up voucher specimens, make duplicates and then exchange or swap 
these with overseas institutions. While material transfer agreements may be 
signed, these do not seem to consider the issues of concern to indigenous 
people. Once the specimens have been sent overseas, they become the property 
of the overseas institution and it has control over them, and third parties may be 
able to access the genetic resources of these samples. It seems specimens lodged 
in most Australian herbaria can also be sampled (for example, for bar-coding of 
genetic information) as long as the process is not &lsquo;destructive&rsquo; (that is, so long 
as the specimen is not destroyed or parts of the specimens such as flowers go 
missing).
</p>
<p>(ii) Preparation of plant materials
</p>
<p>Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people working in the project have emphasised that preparation of 
a traditional medicine is something that takes time and care to do properly. If 
one takes pride in the work and the appearance of the final medicine, this shows 
respect to the plant and to the ancestors who passed knowledge about it to 
the current generations. The way the plant material is harvested and prepared 
for extraction, and the actual water used to prepare the extract, are seen by 
Kuuku I&rsquo;yu researchers as essential in ensuring the medicine has the desired 
effect when tested in the project (Figure 2).</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>43
</p>
<p>Figure 2.  Preparation of a plant for the study according to traditional 
methods.  
</p>

</p>
<p>Where possible, traditional medicinal preparations have been prepared by 
traditional owners as part of the project for testing in the laboratory. In most 
cases these are prepared by boiling or soaking the plant material in water. This 
ensures that the components of the plant tested in the laboratory are those that 
would be present in the actual traditional medicine.
</p>
<p>In some cases, the method of traditional use presents a challenge for laboratory 
testing. Some of the plants used in Kuuku I&rsquo;yu traditional medicine are not 
prepared as water extracts; rather, the plant part is crushed and administered 
directly to the affected part of the body. For example, one plant researched in 
the study is used as a pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory medication for the 
mouth, with the plant material chewed and inserted directly onto an inflamed 
or infected tooth. Another small herb is used as a wound treatment by dabbing 
the juice from the stem or fleshy roots directly onto the affected area of the skin. 
In these cases, laboratory testing (which requires some kind of extract of the 
plant to put into the testing models) cannot directly mimic the traditional use. 
Discussions among the researchers concluded that the best approach to testing 
these types of plants was to transport the plant material to the laboratory, and </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>44
</p>
<p>to use laboratory solvents (such as alcohols) which will extract such a broad 
range of components from the plant that they should include those components 
released with the direct application.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of the project has been an examination of essential oils from some 
of the aromatic plants that grow on Kuuku I&rsquo;yu homelands. Essential oils are the 
volatile components of plants. These are often complex mixtures of components 
that contribute to a plant&rsquo;s characteristic smell and taste. In a Western scientific 
approach, essential oils are usually produced through steam distillation of plant 
material to produce a concentrated oil extract.
</p>
<p>Obviously, distillation of essential oils is not among the traditional plant 
extraction methods. However, Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people have traditionally recognised 
the value of the volatile components of some of their plants. For example, 
vapours inhaled from crushed leaves have been used for the relief of common 
cold symptoms, and particular scented plants have been used as &lsquo;love potions&rsquo; 
to attract members of the opposite sex. Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people also have knowledge 
of the content of the aromatic oils in different plants in different locations of 
their homelands, as well as the optimal time or season to harvest plant materials. 
The Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation sees distillation of essential oils on 
homelands as a feasible means of generating income and local jobs. Essential 
oils and products made from them (such as soaps and skin lotions) may form the 
basis of small-scale businesses.
</p>
<p>The distillation of essential oils has been undertaken on the homelands as part 
of the project. This has allowed Kuuku I&rsquo;yu and university-based researchers 
to work together in examining yields of oils from different plant materials, the 
characteristics of the extracted oils, and the feasibility of the oil-distillation 
process on homelands (Figures 3a and 3b). </p>

</p>
<p>(iii) Laboratory investigations of plant extracts
</p>
<p>The focus of laboratory testing has been to examine activities suggested by the 
traditional uses of the plant. For example, plants that have uses for treating 
infected skin sores have been tested in the laboratory for activity against common 
bacteria that cause skin infections, and plants used to treat skin irritation or 
mouth afflictions have been tested for effects against inflammation. However, </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2 . Ancient but New
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>it is important to emphasise that Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people involved in the project 
do not see indigenous knowledge as something that is static or &lsquo;stuck in the 
past&rsquo;. Rather, they say that the &lsquo;old people&rsquo; would have needed to adapt their 
knowledge to new challenges that confronted them, including new diseases. 
For this reason, relevant Kuuku I&rsquo;yu traditional owners in the project feel it is 
appropriate for university-based researchers to test the traditional medicinal 
plants against a range of illnesses that confront indigenous and other Australians 
in modern society, such as diabetes, viral infections, cancer and antibiotic-
resistant bacteria, as well as conditions that reflect the more traditional uses. 
They want broader recognition of the value of their medicines and the role they 
can play in maintaining health among both indigenous and non-indigenous 
people.
</p>
<p>To date, the laboratory testing has been focused around three main areas. First, 
plant extracts including essential oils have been tested for activity against 
micro-organisms (including bacteria, yeasts and viruses) that cause human 
diseases such as skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. This 
testing has also included examination of activities against bacteria resistant to 
many of the modern antibiotics used in Western medicine. Some extracts have 
been tested in a model of skin inflammation. Discovery of extracts that can 
modulate inflammatory processes could play a role in management of a number 
of medical conditions for which inflammation is an important component, such 
as eczema, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel 
disease and some kinds of cancer. Anti-cancer testing, using cancer cells from a 
variety of cancer types such as skin, breast, lung and gastrointestinal cancers, 
has also been conducted on plant extracts. In the future it is planned to expand 
the testing to other areas of interest such as mental illness, diabetes, insect 
repellency and parasitic diseases.
</p>
<p>Visits to the university-based laboratories by Chuulangun Aboriginal 
Corporation chair David Claudie were used to assist traditional custodians 
of the plants in understanding what was actually being done with the plant 
extracts in the laboratory (Figure 4). However, the distance between Adelaide in 
South Australia and central Cape York (and the expense of travel) has presented 
challenges in getting more Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people to experience laboratory work 
first hand. In the future we hope to establish a small homelands-based laboratory 
and extraction facility that will allow some more of the Western scientific 
research and extraction processes to be conducted on the actual homelands, 
with university-based and Kuuku I&rsquo;yu researchers working together.</p>

<p>Various extracts that have demonstrated the most promising activity in the 
laboratory-based testing have been subjected to chemical analysis techniques to 
work out what active components are present in them.
</p>
<p>(g) Project Findings and Moving Towards Plant-based 
Enterprises
</p>
<p>This project has had the important aim of identifying plant species with 
potential for development as plant-based products that can support homelands-
based development. A number of the plant species chosen for laboratory testing 
by the research team have demonstrated activities which reflect traditional 
understandings of these plants. These serve as examples of the way in which 
Western science and Australian indigenous science and culture may come to the 
same finding. Our experience so far with one of these plant species is described 
below.</p>

<p>5. Uncha (Dodonaea polyandra): An Example 
Case Heading Towards Commercialisation &mdash;  
And an Ongoing Learning Experience
</p>
<p>(a) Traditional Use and Western Scientific Investigation
</p>
<p>Uncha (Dodonaea polyandra, Sapindaceae) is a plant species used for medicinal 
purposes by particular Kuuku I&rsquo;yu traditional owners (Figure 5). Knowledge 
about the plant is passed through the patrilineal bloodline. The plant is used 
traditionally to decrease pain and discomfort in the mouth from toothache and 
infection. 
</p>
<p>Figure 5. Uncha (Dodonaea polyandra).
</p>
<p>Photo: N. Smith.
</p>
<p>The plant was first collected for our project as part of field work on Chuulangun 
homelands in 2006. Based on traditional uses, the team decided to undertake 
laboratory-based tests for anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and cell-toxicity 
effects. Traditionally the plant material (the join of leaf and stem) is applied 
directly to the mouth. For testing in laboratory models, the team made ethanolic 
(alcohol) extracts of leaf and stem to extract a range of the plant&rsquo;s chemical 
constituents that would otherwise be released directly if the plant was chewed 
or crushed. Both leaf and stem extracts showed significant activity in a model 
of skin inflammation (conducted by Dr Jiping Wang at the University of South </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>50
</p>
<p>Australia). The comparable effects in this model were with the known anti-
inflammatory medicine hydrocortisone (available in over-the-counter anti-
inflammatory skin creams).
</p>
<p>Further chemical analysis of the extracts has been undertaken as part of a PhD 
project by Bradley Simpson. This part of the study has led to the isolation of 
several compounds which are responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of 
the extract in the laboratory model. Some of the purified compounds performed 
similarly to a potent (prescription) anti-inflammatory drug called betamethasone 
in the testing model. These components isolated from the plant are &lsquo;new&rsquo; to 
Western science but related to other compounds known to exist in other species 
in the genus Dodonaea. The most active compounds are from a class called furano-
clerodane diterpenoids. The actions of the components of Dodonaea polyandra 
are of course not &lsquo;new&rsquo; to the particular Kuuku I&rsquo;yu traditional owners who 
have used this plant medicinally for generations.
</p>
<p>(b) That&rsquo;s All Very Interesting &mdash; But Now What?
</p>
<p>While compound isolation and identification from plants is no trivial task, in 
some ways the research to this point was the easy part, in that there were (and 
are) clear guidelines and methods for the conduct of such research. The next 
steps were (and continue to be) in some ways the most challenging. We now 
need to negotiate the pathway to getting a potential commercial outcome that 
can create enterprises on Kuuku I&rsquo;yu homelands and bring benefits back to the 
Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation.
</p>
<p>(i) Commercial partners and patenting
</p>
<p>To develop medicinal plant products that can be sold widely (and that make 
therapeutic claims) it is necessary to meet the requirements of the Therapeutic 
Goods Act 1989 and regulations, and to seek approval from the Therapeutic 
Goods Administration in Australia (and similar agencies in other countries). 
The levels of evidence for the safety and efficacy of any new product entering 
the market require a great deal of research and hence financial support. 
Therefore, to progress to a commercial product it is almost inevitable that a 
commercial partner will have to be involved. University researchers are also 
under considerable pressure to publish the findings of the research to meet 
the needs of PhD candidature, to develop track records for further funding 
applications to support the work, and to demonstrate external review of the 
research which is important in satisfying the requirements of potential funders 
of commercialisation.
</p>
<p>In 2009 the research partners decided to proceed with patenting the project 
IP related to their findings on the Uncha plant, and in November 2009 two </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2 . Ancient but New
</p>
<p>51
</p>
<p>provisional patent applications were filed. The first of these covered an extract 
and extraction process for the Uncha plant. The second covered the compounds 
themselves and likely derivatives for anti-inflammatory applications. These two 
applications were considered appropriate to allow different streams of product 
development, including herbal extract products or products containing 
the isolated components. The Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation and 
the University of South Australia are joint applicants (owners) of the patent 
applications, and in November 2010 the applications moved to the Patent 
Cooperation Treaty (PCT) phase. All patent costs so far have been borne by 
the university&rsquo;s commercialisation company, ITEK (a wholly University of South 
Australia-owned company).
</p>
<p>The team is also exploring the use of trade marks to identify extracts as belonging 
to the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation and sourced appropriately from the 
Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Northern Kaanju homelands.
</p>
<p>A number of common medical conditions involve inflammation. Anti-
inflammatory applications therefore have potential in a variety of areas, 
including cosmetic uses, over-the-counter herbal complementary medicine 
products and conventional pharmaceuticals (isolated compounds or derivatives), 
and some potential commercial partners have already been identified. Cosmetic 
applications are likely to be the first commercial uses for the extracts. 
</p>
<p>Our wish is to maximise IP in the project by conducting as much research as 
possible in the university and on the homelands before linking with a commercial 
partner. The decision to file the patent applications was not taken lightly but 
was considered as our best option at the time. The patent process as it stands is 
far from ideal for this type of work. Filing of the applications allows the research 
to be published, but now sets a tight timeline (18 months) before the patents 
move to the &lsquo;national phase&rsquo; of the application, where costs escalate rapidly. 
At the national stage we may need to have a third party on board to help pay 
for the upcoming patent costs, because the university commercialisation arm 
may not be able to support this specification in the absence of external funding 
and significant progression of the technology into a market-ready product. As 
a team we may need a long-term perspective on this. For our first products, we 
may need to take partners on earlier, with a view to eventually creating our own 
spin-out company with a pipeline of products. In the future we may be able to 
maintain more of the research in-house and maintain patents on other extracts 
to a later development stage.</p>

</p>
<p>(ii) Issues around patenting and IP protection for the Chuulangun 
Aboriginal Corporation
</p>
<p>This patenting process has raised other issues besides those of costs and 
timelines. Patents do not allow &lsquo;ancestors&rsquo; or whole clan groups to be named 
&mdash; only &lsquo;inventors&rsquo; according to a narrow definition. While the Chuulangun 
Aboriginal Corporation can be an owner on the patent, their ancestors or clan 
group as a whole cannot be named as the inventors. Traditional owner preference 
would also be to patent plants from the particular area. While it may be possible 
to genetically map plants to particular areas and patent extracts from them, 
a pharmaceutical commercial partner buying the right to use the IP covered 
by the patent may want to ensure it is covered for extracts from the species 
generally so no one else can produce what it perceives as the &lsquo;same&rsquo; product. 
Additionally, patenting allows protection of IP only for a defined period of time.
</p>
<p>Article 31 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
(UNDRIP) states the right of indigenous peoples to &lsquo;maintain, control, develop 
and protect&rsquo; their sciences, including medicines and botanical resources.31 
While still an aspirational document, rather than a treaty or law, the UNDRIP 
highlights the rights of indigenous peoples to maintain their own institutions, 
traditions and cultures, and the right to develop their economic and social 
needs and aspirations as a group. The Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD) is the major international convention that recognises the ownership of 
traditional knowledge by indigenous communities and therefore the right to 
protect this cultural and intellectual property. The CBD also highlights the need 
to preserve the knowledge of indigenous communities that can contribute to 
the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. However, a number of 
limitations of the CBD for indigenous peoples have been discussed, particularly 
the authority given to nation states to make agreements in relation to access to 
natural resources and benefit-sharing agreements. These may undermine the 
rights of indigenous peoples.32
</p>
<p>In our experience, the current patent system places too much emphasis on the 
value of the novel and inventive steps from a Western scientific perspective. 
Indeed, inventors are defined from this perspective. The limited timeframe of 
protection is also problematic for traditional custodians who have held their 
knowledge over generations. If indigenous peoples are to protect their sciences, 
including medicines, as stated in the DRIP, new legal mechanisms need to be 
developed to allow them to do this &lsquo;from their side&rsquo;. The Chuulangun Aboriginal 
Corporation is currently exploring options for legal changes in Australia that

<p>may be required to ensure that medicinal plant knowledge can be protected 
and to formalise their traditional knowledge of plant properties as the IP of the 
Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Northern Kaanju people. While some aspects of &lsquo;cultural knowledge&rsquo; 
are hard to define to outsiders, the knowledge of a plant species or population, 
the properties it affords and the preparation required are fairly concrete, and 
the Corporation believes such knowledge could and should be legally protected.
</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s Native Title Act 199333 establishes a framework for the protection 
and recognition of native title over land and waters. In the native title case 
of Western Australia v Ward,34 the High Court found that native title law did 
not extend to protecting cultural knowledge from misuse. To do so would 
extend it beyond the control of access to land to the control of access to cultural 
knowledge, in what the court considered to be a &lsquo;new species of intellectual 
property&rsquo;. However, this is what the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation 
believes its people need if they are to ensure that their knowledge can be used 
for the benefit of the world of medicine and for their own economic benefit, and 
on their terms. From the Corporation&rsquo;s reading of it, the Act should afford these 
protections. The Corporation is currently seeking advice on whether reforms to 
Australia&rsquo;s Native Title Act may help in achieving protections, or whether legal 
reforms to IP laws are needed instead.
</p>
<p>At a local level, the Chuulangun Aboriginal Corporation is planning to form a 
body representing the IP of the Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people to arrange and distribute 
commercial benefits, decide on commercial use, investigate misuse and oversee 
research collaborations.
</p>
<p>(c) Supply and Sustainability Considerations in 
Product Development
</p>
<p>Central to the vision of the medicinal plants project is the development of 
plant-based products to foster development on Kuuku I&rsquo;yu Northern Kaanju 
homelands. This in turn would offer opportunities for employment, financial 
independence and increased self-esteem, particularly for younger Kuuku I&rsquo;yu 
Northern Kaanju people. If sustainable plant-based products are to be developed, 
the sustainable harvest or production of plant materials on the homelands will 
be crucial.
</p>
<p>In discussions with potential commercial partners, issues surrounding the 
supply of plant extracts and compounds have been raised as matters of high 
priority. A suggestion by some commercial operators that cultivation and 
harvesting of plant material in some kind of established horticultural facility

</p>
<p>away from the homelands could overcome supply issues is not acceptable to 
our research team. The holder of the plant knowledge is attached to the plant 
by a &lsquo;story&rsquo;. These holders of knowledge are individuals within clan groups. 
Under traditional law, growing the plant elsewhere for the natural resource that 
is known to Kuuku I&rsquo;yu is not an option. It would cause problems for both the 
grower and the holder of the &lsquo;story&rsquo;. We need to make sure that traditional 
governance systems are respected and that issues of plant supply can be met in a 
culturally appropriate manner. The timelines of the patenting process and need 
to have a commercial partner in place put considerable pressure on the team 
to ensure these issues are addressed quickly. As the research and commercial 
development moves into its next stage, there will be a need for on-ground 
research, led by relevant traditional owners on their homelands, to examine a 
range of sustainability issues. For each of the plant species that has commercial 
potential, including the Uncha plant, a variety of questions arise. These include 
questions such as:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 What quantities of plant materials can reasonably be harvested from plants 
growing naturally on Kuuku I&rsquo;yu homelands?
</p>
<p>&bull;	 What impact would harvesting have on the number of these plants, and on 
other species (such as insects, birds, mammals) that depend on them?
</p>
<p>&bull;	 How quickly would the plants re-grow and when could they be re-harvested?
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Would it be feasible to cultivate the plant on homelands?
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Would plant materials obtained from cultivated plants have the same 
medicinal properties and components as those that are wild-harvested?
</p>
<p>&bull;	 What infrastructure and management structures need to be in place to allow 
a successful plant-harvesting and extraction enterprise to be developed on 
the homelands?
</p>
<p>&bull;	 How will issues of remoteness be overcome?
</p>
<p>6. Conclusions 
</p>
<p>Our medicinal plants research project and journey towards development 
of locally driven enterprises based on traditional medicines in Kuuku I&rsquo;yu 
homelands has raised, and continues to raise, a number of important issues. 
We believe that research of this type must be driven by indigenous traditional 
owners, and incorporate their own views of how their medicinal products should 
be researched and developed. Importantly, the project highlights inadequacies 
in current legal systems to support IP protection in work of this kind. There is a 
need for other mechanisms of indigenous cultural and IP protection which will 
be recognised and respected by potential commercial partners &mdash; not just an 
emphasis on the Western scientific aspects and their protection through patents. </p>

</p>
<p>A future in which Australian indigenous peoples&rsquo; IP rights are recognised by the 
legal system is essential to traditional owners represented by the Chuulangun 
Aboriginal Corporation. With this in place, not only the Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people 
but all Australians and people worldwide could benefit from &lsquo;new&rsquo; medicines. 
Without it, Kuuku I&rsquo;yu people&rsquo;s knowledge of medicines will be guarded closely 
to prevent IP &lsquo;theft&rsquo; by unscrupulous companies.

<p>1. Introduction
</p>
<p>Wild or &lsquo;bush&rsquo;1 harvest of native desert species for consumption and customary 
trade has been actively pursued by Aboriginal peoples in central Australia for 
thousands of years.2 Bush harvest for financial return has, by contrast, been 
occurring in central Australia for at least thirty to forty years3 and is primarily 
undertaken by Aboriginal women in remote settlements.4 However, to date, 
financial returns for these industry participants have been marginal. Harvesters 
have relied on the activities of non-Aboriginal traders (as they are known)5 making 
buying trips to their communities, and this occurs in an ad hoc fashion, with little 
planning or advance notice.6 This has created a situation where the women are 
entirely reliant on the traders in several ways: for market information, including 
the dynamics of product demand and in determining prices; and as sole buyers 
of their produce, which occurs via cash payments.7 The women have stated that 
they are often unsure about what the traders will require from year to year, and 
have found that on some occasions they have harvested particular fruits and seeds 
only to find that there was no demand for them.8 Added complexities include 
the harvesters&rsquo; physical isolation from the market and a lack of transport and 
telecommunications &mdash; a common issue in remote Australia.9
</p>
<p>1 Aboriginal harvesters in central Australia with whom the Desert Knowledge CRC has worked prefer the terms 
&lsquo;bush harvest&rsquo; and &lsquo;bush food&rsquo; when referring to native plants and their harvest, rather than &lsquo;wild harvest&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;wild food&rsquo;, both of which infer that the plants are not cared for. M Ryder et al,&lsquo;Sustainable Bush Produce Systems:

</p>
<p>Changing this situation of Aboriginal peoples&rsquo; peripheral inclusion in the 
industry is one means of increasing broader Aboriginal participation in the 
Australian economy. Increased economic participation has been promoted as 
a means of decreasing disadvantage of Aboriginal peoples in Australia,10 and 
there is thus considerable interest and activity directed at &lsquo;improving&rsquo; the 
current situation. Attempts have been made in central Australia to increase the 
participation of remote Aboriginal peoples in the bush-foods industry through a 
variety of mechanisms, and with mixed results.11 Most of these have been based 
on Western understandings of trade and commerce. To date, there has been little 
research undertaken on understanding the current ways in which Aboriginal 
peoples are already participating in the bush-foods industry, particularly those 
engaged in bush harvesting.12
</p>
<p>The Desert Knowledge Cooperative Research Centre,13 through its &lsquo;Bush Products 
from Desert Australia Core Research Project&rsquo; situated within a programme of 
research entitled &lsquo;Thriving Desert Economies&rsquo;,14 invested considerable resources 
in understanding and attempting to improve current participation rates by 
Aboriginal peoples. In part, this project helped researchers to understand the 
complex socio-cultural differences that exist between the Aboriginal harvesters 
and the rest of the bush-food supply chain in which they are situated. These 
differences relate to the &lsquo;two worlds&rsquo; in which the women walk: the world of 
Western commerce, and their own cultural imperatives related to the harvesting 
of bush foods. 
</p>
<p>A critical factor in the &lsquo;two worlds&rsquo; paradigm is the importance of the social 
and cultural context and dual knowledge systems within which industry 
participants are situated and operate.15 For example, Aboriginal harvesters of 
fruit and seeds in the Northern Territory have articulated a range of reasons for 
harvesting: it is a customary activity associated with health and wellbeing; it 
helps to pass on traditional knowledge; and it is part of caring for Country &mdash; a 
cultural responsibility.16 Since harvesting activities constitute only a small part 
of the individuals&rsquo; income, all of these reasons are in addition to, and arguably

<p>override, the motive of financial return.17 For these participants, harvesting is 
undertaken in the context of a world view which prioritises the importance 
of cultural traditions associated with kinship relationships and customary 
governance systems over economic participation. For non-Aboriginal and non-
remote participants whose primary incomes are derived from the industry, 
participation is fundamentally for economic reasons and supported by a 
Westernised world view of what that means &mdash; a world in which negotiated 
relationships, rather than kinship relationships, are the norm. Understanding 
these differing perspectives is important, particularly at the nexus in bush-food 
supply chains where intercultural trade occurs. These perspectives impact upon 
the value attached to resource flows, financial return, relationships between 
chain participants, and, indeed, in considerations of the &lsquo;products&rsquo; themselves 
as both cultural icons and commodities.
</p>
<p>This chapter discusses a participatory action research (PAR) project undertaken 
with remote Aboriginal harvesters of katyerr18 (Solanum centrale, bush tomato 
or desert raisin), entitled &lsquo;Information = Power: Walking the Bush Tomato 
Value Chain&rsquo; (hereafter I = P project).19 The chapter focuses on the participatory 
nature of the project and discusses the effectiveness of PAR as a methodological 
approach for negotiating the &lsquo;two worlds&rsquo; paradigm. Further, it signals the 
importance of PAR as a methodological approach that can assist in navigating 
the complexities associated with intellectual property (IP) rights: for example, 
in understanding Aboriginal peoples&rsquo; customary use rights around knowledge 
of bush plants and Western imperatives around efficiently defined IP rights. 
Developing governance systems for the commercial use of biological resources 
where there may be competing and/or complementary cultural and commercial 
imperatives around such resources is an urgent priority.
</p>
<p>The chapter first grounds PAR in contemporary literature; provides background 
information on the I = P project; describes the activities undertaken within 
the project; and discusses the lessons from these in the context of the PAR 
literature. Following this, I reflect on my own learning as a participant in 
the project. Finally, the chapter provides recommendations on using PAR as 
a research approach in further bush-foods and bush-medicine research. This 
has relevance in the protection of Aboriginal ecological knowledge (AEK) in 
the context of the increasing commercialisation of native species. The chapter

respect and as acknowledgement that it was the term consistently used by the Aboriginal participants during 
the course of the project being reported on in this chapter.

</p>
<p>2. Participatory Action Research
</p>
<p>PAR is an approach to enquiry that attempts to incorporate the elements 
of both participation and action implied in the name. It is a process aimed 
at identifying a problematic social situation or existing phenomenon, 
understanding it, and then taking some action to rectify the problem, or 
changing the situation, with the active participation and intervention of the 
social actors who are the &lsquo;subjects&rsquo; of the research. It attempts to integrate 
experience, action and reflection.20 Reason describes two primary objectives 
in PAR: to produce both knowledge and action that is directly useful; and 
consciousness-raising (learning) that creates empowerment.
</p>
<p>PAR as a research approach has its roots in research on social change in 
developing countries (particularly on colonised and oppressed peoples).21 
In the 1970s there emerged a growing and radical critique of social theory 
amongst those within the social science community (most particularly within 
the fields of sociology, anthropology, education and theology) engaged in 
research in the developing world. This critique related to academic insistence 
on value neutrality and its associated objectivity, plus academic rigour in 
the pursuit of science knowledge, when, simultaneously, social researchers 
were confronting situations of massive structural crises, oppression and social 
change related to increasing capitalism and modernisation in the developing 
countries with which they were engaged.22 There resulted a move away from 
academic aloofness towards researchers taking personal positions that enabled 
them to take a new view of knowledge. Techniques were developed that 
allowed researchers to apply knowledge in social and political situations to 
effect transformation, and this led to the development of participatory methods 
of social inquiry.23 Primary aims were to make knowledge more accessible 
to research &lsquo;subjects&rsquo; and to help them to understand that knowledge could

</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>be used as an instrument of power and control.24 In recent times, PAR has 
been increasingly used in a number of fields of enquiry, including health, 
education, organisational change management and agriculture.25
</p>
<p>PAR views social reality not as something pre-given or pre-defined but 
as something co-created.26 Epistemologically speaking, PAR implies a 
methodological approach at the macro or &lsquo;stage-setting&rsquo; level,27 and that 
favours collaborative forms of enquiry as the means for gaining knowledge 
and applying it.28 It is at once constructivist, dialogical and proactive, 
attempting to centralise participant and researcher values,29 and falls most 
easily within the critical theory paradigm.30 PAR can therefore be seen as a 
useful methodological approach to research questions of which differing 
knowledge systems and associated world views (for example, Western science 
and traditional ecological knowledge) are a feature, because it emphasises 
central participation in the research by people who are knowledgeable about 
the research topic from multiple perspectives, affected by it, and may wish to 
use the research to effect change. 
</p>
<p>There are numerous recent examples of PAR use in co-research between 
indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, both in Australia and internationally,31 
and it is an increasingly favoured approach with indigenous peoples in health 
research in particular.32

</p>
<p>An important component of PAR is the positioning of the researchers as co-
learners and facilitators, rather than as objective observers.33 The emphasis is 
on collaboration and participation, rather than the detached perspective of 
objectivity associated with positivistic approaches. Carr and Kemmis describe 
three different aspects of the role of the researcher in PAR approaches&mdash; 
technical, practical or emancipatory &mdash; and that which is adopted is dependent 
on the nature and purpose of the research activity being undertaken.34
</p>
<p>Under this schema, PAR differs significantly from other research approaches in 
that it is not extractive: that is, researchers are not &lsquo;experts&rsquo; who study their 
subjects and then go away to write their papers. Rather they are co-participants, 
experiencing a problem situation or phenomenon in order to better understand 
it and to assist in changing it.35 Participatory approaches have as an ideal the 
democratically negotiated processes between academics and other participants 
in the research.36 One criticism of PAR relates to the balance of power in PAR 
and a legacy of colonialism in academic&ndash;indigenous research partnerships.37 
This colonial legacy (following Smith) privileges some knowledge types and 
the world view from within which such knowledge is formed, based on 
externally driven research and interventions. Power, and the challenge this 
presents to the democratic ideal of equal participation, is related to the level 
of influence different participants are able to wield in the research.38 It is 
important to consider, therefore, the influence of externalities to the research, 
such as language (including whose language is used to discuss and formulate the 
research), research funding imperatives and the extent to which the proposed 
research sits within a broader institutional research framework or context.

<p>participants about the direction of proposed research to be undertaken by 
DKCRC in its &lsquo;Bush Products from Desert Australia&rsquo; core project.40 Workshop 
participants endorsed the adoption of a value-chain approach,41 but also 
determined that the research should be participatory, and focus primarily on 
katyerr as a high-demand desert product in the bush-foods industry. Katyerr 
is also highly significant for its spiritual importance, featuring in the Dreaming 
stories of many desert Aboriginal peoples.42
</p>
<p>Participants believed that understanding the social context of the supply/value 
chain must precede any operational changes.43
</p>
<p>The participants outlined a number of different personal values related to 
bush food during the course of the workshop. These values &lsquo;related to the 
importance of bush foods as an industry and an integral part of Indigenous 
livelihoods&rsquo;.44 Participants articulated values related to community and land 
and the recognition of cultural values: for example,
</p>
<p>future for kids; good healthy food; health food [for] colds; keep it strong 
for the young people; it&rsquo;s where we come from; land management; we 
need to live with the land; management of the land; integrity of the food 
related to Aboriginal values and the land; recognition of where it comes 
from.45
</p>
<p>Other value statements related to the growth and development of the bush-
foods industry and benefits for individuals, and included:

<p>Participants clearly expressed values that demonstrated the importance of bush 
food both commercially and culturally. This can be summed up in the statement:

41 The value chain concept was first described by Michael Porter, see M Porter Competitive Advantage (The 
Free Press. New York, 1985) 11 and encompasses a chain of activities undertaken within firms or more broadly 
at the industry level where each activity in the chain adds value to a product as it moves from supplier 
to the market. Value chain analysis has become an accepted, useful, contemporary tool for determining 
where competitive advantage can be generated for the actors within value chains, particularly in the agri-
industry sector, see K Bryceson and C Smith, &lsquo;Abstraction and Modelling of Agri-food Chains as Complex 
Decision Making Systems&rsquo; (Proceedings of the EAAE Conference on &lsquo;System Dynamics and Innovation in 
Food Networks&rsquo; Innsbruck-Igls, Austria, February 18-22, 2008). The bush-food industry can be classified as 
part of this sector.

<p>&hellip;[the] challenge lies in recognising that bush foods cross two cultures 
(economic and Indigenous) and needs [sic] to deliver values to both.47
</p>
<p>Among the workshop participants was a group of remote Aboriginal women 
from a settlement approximately 270 kilometres north-east of Alice Springs, in 
the Northern Territory, who were invited to attend because of their involvement 
in the bush-foods industry as bush harvesters. These women made a number 
of comments48 related to better understanding the movement of the katyerr 
they picked on their land after the fruit left their community. One woman said, 
&lsquo;It would be good to know where our food goes.&rsquo; This statement was pivotal to 
both the rationale for the subsequent development of I = P, and in formulating 
the activities undertaken within the project. As will be seen in the discussion 
section of this chapter, it was also pivotal in terms of the &lsquo;two worlds&rsquo; paradigm 
of bush foods, and the various understandings and positions brought to the 
project by its participants.
</p>
<p>Following the workshop, the DKCRC successfully sought funding from the 
Northern Territory Natural Resources Management Board to undertake the I = 
P project, which articulated its broadest aim as enabling the bush harvesters to 
&lsquo;see where their food goes&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>Along with the initial group from the stakeholder meeting, one other woman 
expressed her interest in being part of the I = P project. She was not involved 
in bush harvesting but, together with her partner, operated a small commercial 
katyerr plantation where fruit was harvested by hand. The project participants 
also included two representatives from a reference group49 established to 
guide bush-harvest research in the broader Bush Products Core Project. In all, 
there were twelve project participants, including me and other research and 
supporting team members. The group determined that a physical journey, 
following katyerr to various (commercial) destinations beyond central Australia, 
would be a useful way of understanding where the fruit went, how it was used 
and who used it. 
</p>

were mindful of the need to ensure it was conducted within Western regulatory

harvest research activities. It comprised respected Aboriginal women recognised as cultural custodians of 
bush-harvest knowledge, some of whom were also bush-food industry participants.</p>

</p>
<p>frameworks for human research, and also to ensure the project met Aboriginal 
participants&rsquo; needs and expectations in this regard. While Western frameworks 
are aimed at protecting research participants, including Aboriginal peoples, the 
DKCRC also produced a set of specific research protocols50 developed by remote 
Aboriginal desert peoples and used consistently across the life of the CRC. The 
project was conducted in accordance with these protocols, and also obtained 
ethics approval from the Central Australian Human Research Ethics Committee 
(CAHREC).51 CAHREC is a committee of the Northern Territories Department of 
Health, and considers both health and non-health research involving Aboriginal 
peoples in the Northern Territory. It does this through its Aboriginal Committee, 
whose primary aim is to protect Aboriginal peoples in the Northern Territory 
in the conduct of research, and to ensure Aboriginal peoples benefit from such 
research.52 The committee, which aims to span all major language groups in 
the Northern Territory, includes at least one male elder and one female elder 
among its all-Aboriginal members, as well as at least one person with research 
experience in non-health related research. 
</p>
<p>Following approval, the project team met at a workshop in Alice Springs in 
July 2008, during which the bush harvesters discussed the project and outlined 
what they currently knew about what happened to the katyerr they picked for 
sale. This session incorporated both talking and drawing, enabling participants 
(some of whom have English as a second or third language) to express their 
knowledge both verbally and pictorially. It provided the baseline observations 
of these participants about their knowledge prior to undertaking the journey. 
I noted that each of the women&rsquo;s drawings included clearly marked direction 
indicators, establishing where they were currently in relation to their home 
community. The activity also enabled the research team to fully explain their 
position as researchers and facilitators, and to talk about what they might do 
after the project: for example, writing about the project, and making a DVD 
and picture story boards so that other Aboriginal women engaged in harvesting 
activities might learn more about the market aspects of katyerr. In accordance 
with DKCRC research protocols, media release forms giving permission to film 
and take photographs of project activities were explained and completed by 
participants. Researchers undertook to ensure that any such materials would 
be available for review by all participants before being released more generally, 
and this was done at the completion of the project.

<p>66
</p>
<p>Immediately following the workshop, we travelled to the Sunshine Coast (via 
Brisbane) in Queensland. On arrival at the airport in Brisbane, the harvesters 
asked where they were in relation to their home communities, and spent some 
time establishing the direction in which those communities lay and the distance 
they had travelled. This was the first major journey many of the harvesters had 
made by air, and it seemed important for them to establish exactly where they 
were in relation to where they had come from.
</p>
<p>We then travelled by road to the Sunshine Coast, where we met with an 
Aboriginal woman who operates a restaurant and catering business. We were 
officially &lsquo;welcomed to Country&rsquo;, as is customary between Australian Aboriginal 
peoples visiting locations beyond those with which they have immediate 
cultural ties. This business operator specialises in the use of bush foods, and 
participants experienced a commercially prepared bush-foods meal, the main 
course of which featured katyerr. For many of the harvesters, this was a new 
experience of bush food, prepared in quite a different way from the traditionally 
prepared bush food they were familiar with. Following the meal, the harvesters 
were able to share with the entire group their stories of bush food, using a series 
of photographs and story boards which had been prepared by members of the 
project team during earlier research with the bush harvesters. The harvesters 
appeared particularly animated and excited during this part of the visit, and 
were very keen to talk about who they were, where they came from and how 
they harvested bush food. In reviewing the subsequent video footage, I also 
noted that there was considerable discussion among the harvesters in their own 
language. They also pointed out the children and grandchildren in the story 
boards and talked about how important it was to &lsquo;keep the knowledge strong&rsquo; 
with these young people. The harvesters also made a point of asking about the 
origin of the katyerr prepared in the meal they had eaten. The business operator 
explained that she bought it from her supplier, but that she wasn&rsquo;t sure from 
which part of central Australia it had started its journey.
</p>
<p>After an overnight stay in Maroochydore, the group flew to Melbourne, 
Victoria. Again, on arrival the harvesters spent time establishing where they 
were in relation to their home communities. In Melbourne, the group visited a 
number of non-Aboriginal owned and operated commercial entities associated 
with bush food. These included a processing factory, a distribution business 
and a large supermarket. 
</p>
<p>At the processing factory, we were shown through the processes associated 
with preparing, cooking, bottling, labelling and packaging various bush foods 
for sale and distribution. The women were interested in learning about these 
various processes, but one incident in the factory stood out in my review of 
the video footage. When the harvesters viewed large bags of raw product that 
had been received at the factory from various suppliers around Australia, they </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3 . &lsquo;It would be good to know where our food goes&rsquo;: Information Equals Power? 
</p>
<p>67
</p>
<p>were highly animated and keen to know from where the bags had originated. 
Comments included, &lsquo;Maybe this [wattleseed, Acacia spp.] came from [community 
name] near us? Those ladies have been picking lots of this.&rsquo; There was also much 
interest in unfamiliar (non-desert) products, and the women wanted to know 
who picked it, where it grew and how it got to the factory. 
</p>
<p>The group met with members of a distribution company which managed the 
movement of finished products from the factory to retail outlets. The company 
presented information about the importance of continuity of supply as a 
requirement for maintaining shelf-space of finished products at supermarkets. 
My review of the video footage indicated that there appeared to be lower levels 
of interest in this part of the activity. I noted that the presentation of information 
was quite abstract, and did not include any specific place-based references.
</p>
<p>At a large supermarket, the group saw the finished products on the shelves. 
The harvesters expressed high interest in the variety of products available and, 
again, interest in where it had originated. 
</p>
<p>The group attended an up-market restaurant in the heart of Melbourne that 
features bush food as an integral part of its menu. This restaurant is owned 
and operated by an Aboriginal woman who described herself as the traditional 
owner of land in the Melbourne region. She welcomed us to her Country and 
provided some history and context about her family and about her business, 
and served a multi-course meal that featured bush foods. I noted (with some 
amusement) the various visual expressions of some of the harvesters as they 
tasted some items on the menu. Some of the dishes were clearly appealing, but 
some were perhaps removed from the women&rsquo;s expectations of what they would 
(or should) taste like. 
</p>
<p>The final activity undertaken by the harvesters was to redraw their 
understandings of &lsquo;where their food goes&rsquo;, based on the journey they had made. 
Again I noted the clearly marked direction indicators on the maps drawn by 
participants. The maps were not drawn in the usual abstract manner common in 
geography textbooks &mdash; that is, with &lsquo;north&rsquo; at the top of the page, &lsquo;south&rsquo; at the 
bottom, and &lsquo;west&rsquo; and &lsquo;east&rsquo; to the left and right respectively. Instead, the maps 
were drawn in relation to the direction the drawer was oriented. For example, 
one participant was facing south, and so drew her map with &lsquo;south&rsquo; at the top 
of the map and &lsquo;north&rsquo; at the bottom. </p>

<p>5. Project Outcomes
</p>
<p>In all, the physical journey occupied one week. It provided many opportunities 
for learning, both on the part of the harvesters and for me. The harvesters were 
able to articulate a greater understanding of &lsquo;where their food goes&rsquo;, and this 
was evidenced in discussions and, particularly, in pictorial representations 
completed at the conclusion of the project. There is also evidence that, as a 
result of undertaking the journey and forming new relationships with others 
in the supply chain, the harvesters have subsequently made some changes 
in the way in which they sell their fruit. In some cases, they are selling more 
directly into the chain, and are initiating these transactions themselves, rather 
than relying on traders making buying trips to their communities. It is likewise 
evident that they have increased their returns via these transactions, and are 
receiving higher payments than previously. 
</p>
<p>6. Discussion
</p>
<p>In an earlier section of this chapter, I highlighted a comment made by a 
participant in an early stakeholder workshop: &lsquo;It would be good to know where 
our food goes.&rsquo; In this section I want to reconsider that statement and the multiple 
meanings that have emerged in light of deeper understandings developed as a 
result of participating in the I = P Project.
</p>
<p>From a Western perspective of participation in the bush-foods industry, there 
is a tendency to see the current participation of remote Aboriginal peoples as 
marginal, in that financial returns to this group are not high. The assumption 
is that increasing participation and knowledge of the Westernised view of 
commerce and what it entails, and the imperative to decrease costs and increase 
profit, is universally desirable. Using a supply or value-chain framework to 
examine participation and to work towards increasing economic participation 
is a logical extension of this thinking. In the context of the I = P project, both 
my interpretation and understanding of the comment &lsquo;It would be good to know 
where our food goes&rsquo; and the broader goals of the DKCRC &lsquo;Bush Products from 
Desert Australia&rsquo; core project were framed by this thinking. From that position, 
the I = P project, and my role as co-researcher, could be seen to encompass the 
&lsquo;technical&rsquo; aspects of participatory action research outlined by Carr and Kemmis.53 
Indeed, this is how I saw my role &mdash; as a facilitator in promoting learning that 
would increase the &lsquo;technical&rsquo; capacity of the harvesters to participate in the 
bush-foods industry. I interpreted the harvesters&rsquo; comment to mean that if they 
knew where &lsquo;their&rsquo; food went, what happened to it (in relation to how others

</p>
<p>69
</p>
<p>value-added to it), who profited and why, they would then come to see that 
there could be opportunities for them to play a greater role in the value-adding 
process. Importantly, I also assumed that this was a shared interpretation. I 
also understood that increasing the harvesters&rsquo; capacity to develop more direct 
relationships with others in the supply chain could help them secure buyers 
for their fruit, thus increasing competition and returns. Research in agrifood 
industries has shown that better connecting component parts of supply chains 
can improve efficiencies and increase multi-directional information flow, and 
to some extent this has occurred in this case. In the context of this chapter, 
however, my intent is to focus on the value of the participatory process as a 
learning mechanism, and in particular to highlight its value (in my case) for 
better understanding the &lsquo;two worlds&rsquo; paradigm referred to in the introduction.
</p>
<p>As a participant in the I = P project, and through the subsequent building of 
deeper relationships with the Aboriginal harvesters, I have come to develop 
different perceptions and understandings of bush food beyond the context 
of participation in an industry. These perceptions and understandings are 
increasingly shaping my thinking and research. To highlight the impact of 
these relationships in changing my perceptions, I will describe an incident that 
occurred subsequent to the I = P journey.
</p>
<p>In another component of the &lsquo;Bush Products from Desert Australia&rsquo; core project, 
horticultural development of &lsquo;bush tomatoes&rsquo;54 has been pursued. As part of 
that work, a trial planting of plants from various desert locations was developed. 
Plants were germinated from held seed stock. The aim of this research was to 
increase knowledge of the horticultural production requirements of &lsquo;bush 
tomatoes&rsquo; as a means of developing a supply mechanism that was more reliable 
than bush harvest, with its inherent issues of climate variability that could 
sometimes limit supply. It would also provide information about horticultural 
production to enable the successful development of Aboriginal horticulturally 
based bush-food enterprises. 
</p>
<p>Very early in the development of this horticultural trial (and prior to the I = P 
project), bush harvesters were invited to visit the trial site to ensure that there 
was Aboriginal involvement and consultation around the project. There was no 
immediate indication from the bush harvesters that they had any issues with it, 
and they were politely attentive to the information that was shared with them. 
However, after developing greater mutual trust and much deeper relationships 
with the harvesters, I later learned that they were quite horrified by this project. 
At the time of their visit (which was during the growing season of katyerr), 
there had been very little bush harvest of katyerr in central Australia because of 
</p>
<p>54 The term &lsquo;bush tomatoes&rsquo; is used here because in the context of the broader DKCRC project, this was the 
term consistently used, and is related to the commercial use of the fruit.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>70
</p>
<p>prevailing dry conditions that were not conducive to its growth in that season. 
The harvesters&rsquo; interpretation of what they saw at the trial site (numerous rows 
of healthy katyerr plants) was later explained to me as a question: &lsquo;Why did you 
mob go out bush and dig up all the katyerr plants and put them in that place in 
Alice Springs? There was none left in the bush for us to pick.&rsquo; It had not occurred 
to me until that time that the harvesters could interpret what we were doing at 
the trial site in this way: that is, for them it explained why there was there was 
no bush katyerr for the women to harvest from the wild.
</p>
<p>This anecdote highlights two important points. First, the thinking that underpins 
the assumptions we make is firmly rooted in the world view within which the 
thinking occurs, and the thinking itself is framed within the language in which 
the thoughts are formed. Secondly, it is only through the development of trust 
found in deeper relationships and engagement with others possessing different 
world views that one can approach new understandings based on those different 
world views. Taking a participatory approach to this project has, in that sense, 
provided the macro environment and indeed &lsquo;set the stage&rsquo; for learning and its 
application to occur in the manner raised by Kidd and Kral.55
</p>
<p>In applying this new understanding, how did I reinterpret the statement &lsquo;It 
would be good to know where our food goes&rsquo;? Did it mean something different from 
what I initially understood it to mean, and was the question itself framed from 
within a language that recognised different emphases and signifiers of what 
was important &mdash; different understandings of spatial and temporal concepts, 
for example? If one considers the actions of the harvesters at various stages 
along the physical journey &mdash; the desire to &lsquo;place&rsquo; themselves in relation to 
their home communities on arrival in different locations, asking questions about 
where raw product inputs had originated and who had harvested them, the way 
in which directions were depicted on their pictorial representations of their 
journey, their animation in talking about their own harvesting activities, and 
the importance of passing on knowledge to their children and grandchildren &mdash; 
one can see a pattern emerging. This pattern, I would argue, relates primarily 
to the importance the harvesters attach to &lsquo;place&rsquo; and &lsquo;belonging&rsquo; both for 
themselves and the bush food they harvest. This importance relates to both the 
people themselves and the foods they harvest in the context of interrelationships 
between land and people. So, the statement &lsquo;It would be good to know where our 
food goes&rsquo; may be intrinsically and inextricably linked to place-based cultural 
identity, to language, and to customary systems of governance related to land, 
people and law. This may translate to a sense of &lsquo;belonging with&rsquo; rather than 
&lsquo;ownership of&rsquo; the fruit they harvested.

</p>
<p>71
</p>
<p>Indeed, this relatedness is highlighted by Walsh and Douglas in their research 
on sustainable bush harvest, reported in Ryder et al.56 In this research, remote 
Aboriginal harvesters articulated the cultural importance of some bush-food 
species with commercial value, including katyerr. Walsh and Douglas argued that 
katyerr and other bush-food plants continue to be &lsquo;key characters in Jukurrpa 
(dreaming) and ceremony&rsquo;.57 They also reported that certain Aboriginal peoples 
consider themselves to be custodians of these resources. This has important 
implications in developing governance systems that protect AEK, because it 
clearly implies an existing governance system for the control and use of these 
resources which predates any Western legal framework. It is also interesting to 
note the use of the term &lsquo;custodian&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;owner&rsquo; in relation to the plants. 
Again, this suggests belonging &lsquo;with&rsquo;, rather than belonging &lsquo;to&rsquo;, in the context 
of relationships between land, people and law.
</p>
<p>On the question of language and its role in shaping thought, an important 
study by Lera Boroditsky and Alice Gaby was conducted with Pormpuraawan-
language speakers in Pormpuraaw, a remote Aboriginal community on Cape 
York.58 In this study, Boroditsky and Gaby demonstrated the differences 
between the way Pormpuraawan speakers and English speakers represented 
time spatially. They concluded that cross-cultural difference in thought is about 
more than style or preference, and is instead intrinsically related to the language 
used to shape the thoughts expressed. While this study was conducted on Cape 
York, Boroditsky and Gaby also pointed to similar differences in central desert 
Aboriginal-language speakers.
</p>
<p>The extractive market process associated with bush food in central Australia 
has developed only in the past thirty to forty years,59 but there is evidence that 
Aboriginal peoples have engaged in customary trade through kinship networks 
and as part of subsistence economies for at least 5,000 years.60 It is highly likely 
that innovative practices associated with sustainable harvesting, such as the 
selection, manipulation and management of biological resources, would have 
arisen as a result.61 In that sense, Western ideas of &lsquo;value adding&rsquo; and the notion 
that this occurs post-extraction and only after the raw product has been sold 
by Aboriginal peoples to others in the value chain, may be incorrect. Cleary et 
al report, for example, on a customary post-harvest treatment of katyerr where 
the fruit is rubbed with clean sand to remove minute hairs reported by the 
harvesters to cause stomach irritation.62 An important point here is that the AEK

</p>
<p>that is being applied in selecting, manipulating and managing &lsquo;wild&rsquo; species, 
and in applying any customary treatments to harvested fruit, is not currently 
recognised in the contemporary commercial trade of bush-harvested fruit, nor 
reflected in the prices paid for raw product.63 I raise these issues here simply to 
highlight the value of PAR in developing &lsquo;two world&rsquo; understandings, and its 
usefulness in revealing the many layers that might need to be peeled back to 
fully understand the intercultural complexity associated with both customary 
and commercial paradigms related to bush foods and their uses. 
</p>
<p>As a researcher, comprehension of the &lsquo;two worlds&rsquo; paradigm (and thus the 
capacity to begin to consider complex questions outside my own world view) 
would not have been possible without first developing the relationships that have 
formed in sharing the I = P project experience. For that reason, it has been an 
enabling and perhaps emancipatory process,64 which has allowed the formation 
of a new perspective outside the personal and institutional constraints within 
which my original thinking was formed. The notion of experience, action and 
reflection65 inherent in PAR has been applied to my own approaches to better 
understanding bush foods and the various lenses through which the resources 
and activities associated with them might be viewed. 
</p>
<p>7. Conclusion
</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter has been to describe and discuss the effectiveness 
of PAR as an approach to research in the bush-foods area through the case-study 
exploration of the I = P project and its learning outcomes. The case study has 
provided useful insights into new ways of considering research approaches that 
emphasise participation, learning and application. I now conclude by drawing 
inferences from those insights and applying them to consideration of research 
issues related to the protection of AEK.
</p>
<p>The protection of AEK is an urgent and high-priority area. Aboriginal peoples&rsquo; 
legal control over this knowledge must be clear and unambiguous, and an 
appropriate regulatory system is an essential step in achieving that control. 
However, it is equally essential that such work is firmly grounded and tested 
within specific, &lsquo;real world&rsquo; contexts where development around native 
biological resources is already occurring.
</p>
<p>Participatory approaches which value and respect (and privilege equitably) 
AEK, customary law and Western legal systems will be essential in creating

</p>
<p>73
</p>
<p>both a new regulatory administrative system and an environment in which it 
can flourish. The place where AEK, Aboriginal customary law and Western legal 
systems come together will undoubtedly require intercultural negotiation and 
translation to develop a new regulatory framework. The primary objectives 
of PAR as outlined by Reason66 &mdash; that is, to produce both knowledge and 
action that is directly useful, and consciousness raising (learning) that creates 
empowerment &mdash; would seem a useful place from which to begin the process. 
</p>
<p>A specific and timely example of how PAR might be used in this context is in 
how AEK needs to be considered in any development of plant breeders&rsquo; rights 
(PBRs) on bush-food and bush-medicine plants. The Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights Act 
1994 (Cth)67 provides the mechanism for granting proprietory rights to breeders 
of certain new plant varieties and fungi in Australia. Currently, there is no 
existing legal requirement to recognise Aboriginal ownership of plant materials, 
nor any consideration of AEK in the development of varieties registered under 
the Plant Breeder&rsquo;s Rights Act. It is important to acknowledge that there are some 
concerns about the validity of some plant breeder&rsquo;s rights (PBRs) registrations 
under the Act, and a level of complexity exists with regard to the application 
of the Act.68 My intent in this section is not to advocate or otherwise for the 
application of PBRs in relation to bush foods and bush medicine. However, 
work on developing PBRs for native species has already begun in Australia, so 
it is relevant to consider it in relation to AEK issues. 
</p>
<p>In the bush-foods context, the primary aim of PBRs is to develop and register new 
plant varieties which have desirable characteristics that decrease production costs 
and increase returns: for example, plants that have a higher fruit yield and that 
are adaptable to a range of growing and mechanical-harvesting conditions. For 
those bush-foods species that enter the market predominantly through harvest 
from the wild (like &lsquo;bush tomatoes&rsquo;), PBRs are seen as a means of increasing and 
stabilising supply through horticultural production of &lsquo;improved&rsquo; varieties.
</p>
<p>There are multiple AEK protection issues to consider. These include but are 
probably not limited to:
</p>

social situations that might otherwise be unattainable from more positivistic

in this intercultural space is extremely worthwhile. Indeed, I would argue 
that colonial understandings and manifestations of power and influence74

broken down through engaging in the kind of deep relationships inherent in 
participatory approaches. Otherwise, as the case study reported on here has 
highlighted, so much may simply be lost in translation.

<p>4. Biopiracy and the Innovations 
of Indigenous Peoples and Local 
</p>
<p>Communities 
</p>
<p>Daniel F . Robinson 
</p>
<p>1. Introduction
Biopiracy is a divisive term, and deliberately so. The original proponent of the 
term, Pat Roy Mooney of the NGO Action Group on Erosion Technology and 
Concentration (ETC), has previously stated that &lsquo;[w]hatever the will and wishes 
of those involved, there is no &ldquo;bioprospecting&rdquo;. There is only biopiracy.&rdquo;1 
He explains that without adequate international laws, standards, norms and 
monitoring mechanisms, the theft of indigenous and local knowledge will 
accelerate in the years to come.
</p>
<p>Although exaggerated for emphasis, Mooney&rsquo;s statement reflects a strong 
discontentment that was particularly prevalent in the 1990s and early 2000s 
amongst sections of the NGO community, many farmer&rsquo;s groups and indigenous 
communities. In the absence of adequate international standards, many 
bioprospecting activities in recent years have been heavily criticised, and 
relatively few have been widely considered to be &lsquo;fair and equitable&rsquo;. However, 
it is very difficult to quantify the regularity and impacts of incidents that might 
be described as &lsquo;biopiracy&rsquo;. The lack of clear definitions from any authoritative 
source has also given rise to confused understandings of bioprospecting, 
biopiracy and &lsquo;[access and] the fair and equitable sharing of benefits&rsquo;. The highly 
significant international agreement on the 2010 Nagoya Protocol on Access to 
Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from 
their Utilization (Nagoya Protocol) to the Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD) may help resolve some of these ambiguities, but it has fallen short on at 
least one front &mdash; the section on monitoring, which is sandwiched within the 
compliance articles. Negotiators had the opportunity to include patent offices 
as checkpoints for the monitoring of access and benefit sharing (ABS) &mdash; a 
potentially critical inclusion for the prevention of patent-based biopiracy &mdash; 
yet it was dropped late in the negotiations as part of the compromise that has 
been achieved in the Nagoya Protocol. Given that the exploitation of traditional 
knowledge by innovations registered through the patent system has been one 
of the main perceived injustices, leading to the creation and use of the term 
biopiracy, this is a considerable gap in the Protocol.

<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>78
</p>
<p>This chapter takes the polemical issue of biopiracy as a starting point, and 
explores the concepts of innovation and traditional knowledge within specific 
cases of bioprospecting and/or biopiracy (depending upon how or from where 
you view them). Specifically, the chapter demonstrates the flawed tendency 
by academics and policy-makers to perpetuate the &lsquo;traditional knowledge&rsquo; 
and &lsquo;modern/scientific knowledge&rsquo; dualism. A more useful focus of analysis is 
indigenous peoples&rsquo; innovations, or at least their contributions to innovation 
(as described in Article 8(j) of the CBD), which may have helped to short-cut 
the research and development (R&amp;D) process. Last, the chapter examines how 
&lsquo;traditional knowledge&rsquo;, used in a number of case-study &lsquo;inventions&rsquo;/discoveries 
that are protected by intellectual property (IP) rights (typically patents and 
plant breeder&rsquo;s rights), might be treated differently if it was described and 
recognised as &lsquo;indigenous innovation&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>2. Biopiracy Typology
Biopiracy is a discursive tool that both describes an injustice and is used 
for political leverage. Although the colonial enterprise of plant and animal 
collection has been going on for centuries, the biopiracy discourse has emerged 
as a powerful counter to the perception of new hegemonies imposed by IP rules 
with global reach, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement 
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). 
Along with the biopiracy discourse has come lobbying for additional rights, 
particularly for indigenous peoples, including ideas for sui generis IP rights 
which must compete with an already competitive suite of private commercial 
rights that have come to be described as &lsquo;intellectual property&rsquo;.2 Lobbying for 
additional third-generation rights which we might call &lsquo;bio-cultural&rsquo; rights of 
indigenous and local peoples has been comparatively more successful in forums 
such as the CBD, where we now see the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) influencing the text of the Nagoya Protocol 
towards recognition of indigenous customary laws (Article 12).3
</p>
<p>These developments and associated lobbying are deliberately targeted towards 
the issue of biopiracy, even if international forums are unable to address that issue 
directly. For example, in the absence of a definition of biopiracy, international 
organisations are left without an appropriate term to describe the specific or 
perceived injustices. In this void, delegates to the various agreements such as the 
CBD, or organisations such as the WTO, commonly use the term. For example:

<p>4 . Biopiracy and the Innovations of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities 
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>One of the measures adopted [in Peru] was the creation of the National 
Anti-Biopiracy Commission, whose basic task is to develop actions to 
identify, prevent and avoid acts of biopiracy which involve biological 
resources of Peruvian origin and traditional knowledge of the indigenous 
peoples of Peru.4
</p>
<p>More politely, the delegates also use the term misappropriation, yet this usually 
has a more limited connotation regarding failure to comply with ABS laws or 
principles. The Secretariat of the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO) has utilised the work of the Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual 
Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (IGC) for 
development of Draft Policy Objectives and Core Principles for the Protection 
of Traditional Knowledge5 which provides principles against misappropriation:
</p>
<p>Any acquisition or appropriation of traditional knowledge by unfair or illicit 
means constitutes an act of misappropriation. Misappropriation may also 
include deriving commercial benefit from the acquisition or appropriation of 
traditional knowledge when the person using that knowledge knows, or is 
grossly negligent in failing to know, that it was acquired or appropriated by 
unfair means; and other commercial activities contrary to honest practices 
that gain inequitable benefit from traditional knowledge.6
</p>
<p>This gives us a very broad understanding of misappropriation. One of the 
greatest difficulties is an appropriate definition of terms such as &lsquo;unfair&rsquo; or &lsquo;illicit&rsquo; 
and, perhaps most difficult, &lsquo;traditional knowledge&rsquo;, which would presumably 
come at the national level if or when these principles are utilised.7 The Draft 
Policy Objectives attempt to clarify in the next point that legal means should be 
available to suppress, amongst other things:
</p>
<p>false claims or assertions of ownership or control over traditional knowledge, 
including acquiring, claiming or asserting intellectual property rights over 
traditional knowledge-related subject matter by a person who knew that 
the intellectual property rights were not validly held in the light of that 
traditional knowledge and any conditions relating to its access...8

Biopiracy&rsquo; (2011) 33(4) European Intellectual Property Review 237. Dutfield makes the useful comment: &lsquo;What 
is traditional knowledge anyway? We only speak of traditional knowledge at all because there is knowledge 
in the world that we assume to be radically different from &ldquo;our&rdquo; knowledge. The latter we prefer to label 
as &ldquo;modern&rdquo; or &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; knowledge. Holding to a traditional-modern epistemological dualism as if all 
knowledge is either all of one or all of the other is in fact simplistic, misleading and unhelpful.&rsquo;

</p>
<p>80
</p>
<p>In this case we might ask: &lsquo;What is a false claim?&rsquo; Is it, say, a claim that does not 
validly meet the requirements for a patent: novelty, invention and usefulness? Surely 
this is too narrow. Is it not possible to hold a valid patent that utilises traditional 
knowledge? Of course the answer is: &lsquo;Yes, it is possible&rsquo;, but these guiding principles 
would assert that prior informed consent would need to be obtained and benefits 
shared with the traditional knowledge holders in order to validate the patent.
</p>
<p>These principles have been heavily debated in the IGC because of exactly these sorts of 
questions. What is probably lacking in these discussions is comparison against a suite 
of different examples that help distinguish what has been called misappropriation, but 
I will more specifically and usefully categorise as different typologies of biopiracy and 
misappropriation (see Box 1). The typologies are based on a review of various descriptions 
of biopiracy by academics and NGOs, as well as an examination of several biopiracy 
or bioprospecting incidents in the book Confronting Biopiracy.9 This chapter will then 
examine specific cases which align with this typology, and which highlight some of the 
key problems associated with the current suite of IP rules for the recognition of indigenous 
contributions to innovation.
</p>
<p>Box 1: Biopiracy and Misappropriation* 
</p>
<p>Patent-based Biopiracy
The patenting of (often spurious) inventions based on biological resources and/
or traditional knowledge that are extracted without adequate authorisation 
and benefit sharing from other (usually developing) countries, indigenous or 
local communities.
</p>
<p>Non-patent Biopiracy
Other IP control (through plant variety protection or deceptive trade marks) 
based on biological resources and/or traditional knowledge that have been 
extracted without adequate authorisation and benefit sharing from other 
(usually developing) countries, indigenous or local communities.
</p>
<p>Misappropriations
The unauthorised extraction of biological resources and/or traditional knowledge 
for research and development purposes from other (usually developing) countries, 
indigenous or local communities, without adequate benefit sharing.
</p>
<p>Note: &lsquo;Authorisation&rsquo; involves obtaining (free) prior informed consent of the appropriate government 
authorities and, where relevant, local communities or other providers.
</p>
<p>* Ibid, 21 [adapted].
</p>
<p>In relation to patent-based biopiracy, it is worth noting that the patent claims 
are often spurious &mdash; what some might simply call &lsquo;bad patents&rsquo;. However, this

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4 . Biopiracy and the Innovations of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities 
</p>
<p>81
</p>
<p>is not the limit of this form of biopiracy. Patents can legally be granted where 
the innovation is new and inventive, but can still be interpreted as biopiracy 
because they have not fulfilled the other legal and/or ethical conditions of prior 
informed consent and benefit sharing. Biopiracy is typically applied to cases 
from developing countries, but it is worth noting that biopiracy may also occur 
through the misappropriation and patenting (or other protection) of indigenous 
knowledge from communities residing in countries such as Australia, New 
Zealand, the US and Canada. 
</p>
<p>In addition to this typology, it is helpful to read the newly agreed scope of 
&lsquo;utilization of genetic resources&rsquo; in the Nagoya Protocol to help decide what will 
be legal (which is a separate question from what is ethical). I have used the term 
&lsquo;biological resources&rsquo; in my typology (written prior to the Nagoya Protocol) 
for two reasons. First, there is no traditional knowledge of &lsquo;genetic resources&rsquo;, 
but rather traditional knowledge exists in association with plants, animals and 
biological resources in the broader sense. I doubt that many would expect local 
communities to have been &lsquo;traditionally&rsquo; examining genes through microarray. 
The term &lsquo;genetic resources&rsquo; has been a red herring which developing countries 
and indigenous peoples have sought to enlarge, first with the Bonn Guidelines, 
and now more successfully with the Nagoya Protocol. Secondly, I use the 
broader term because many of the cases in which perceived injustices claimed 
as biopiracy or misappropriation have occurred relate to the utilisation of 
derivatives, extracts or biological materials in an R&amp;D context. Usefully, the 
Nagoya Protocol now assists in this understanding by expanding the definition 
of &lsquo;Utilization of genetic resources&rsquo; in Article 2:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 &lsquo;Utilization of genetic resources&rsquo; means to conduct research and development 
on the genetic and/or biochemical composition of genetic resources, including 
through the application of biotechnology ... 
</p>
<p>&bull;	 &lsquo;Biotechnology&rsquo; ... means any technological application that uses biological 
systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products 
or processes for specific use.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 &lsquo;Derivative&rsquo; means a naturally occurring biochemical compound resulting 
from the genetic expression or metabolism of biological or genetic resources, 
even if it does not contain functional units of heredity.
</p>
<p>This can be summarised to say that R&amp;D utilising biological resources and their 
biochemical derivatives for any technological application to make or modify 
products for specific (commercial) use must comply with the ABS provisions 
that the Nagoya Protocol will require of Parties. The key inclusions for the 
broadening of the scope of &lsquo;genetic resources&rsquo;, as previously narrowly defined in 
the CBD, are the broader definition of biotechnology and inclusion of references 
to the biochemical composition of genetic resources and derivatives (even if </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>82
</p>
<p>it does not contain functional units of heredity &mdash; DNA or RNA). Article 7 of 
the Protocol also clearly requires that domestic laws must have requirements 
for prior informed consent of traditional knowledge holders (indigenous and 
local communities) on mutually agreed terms (implying benefit sharing, which 
is discussed in Article 12) &mdash; an important addition to the Protocol.
</p>
<p>In summary, this typology of biopiracy and misappropriation accords with the 
Nagoya Protocol. But the Protocol is silent on IP &mdash; a considerable problem for 
policy-makers and those confronting IP-related biopiracy cases. 
</p>
<p>The next step in this chapter is to challenge some misunderstandings about 
bioprospecting, biopiracy and misappropriation through specific case studies 
&mdash; real-world applications that often get forgotten in legal scholarship on these 
issues. In the following section, a specific focus on the idea of &lsquo;innovation&rsquo;, and 
a critique of IP rules for their inherent inability to adequately protect traditional 
knowledge, will be made through these case studies.
</p>
<p>3. Case Studies of Bioprospecting, Biopiracy 
and Misappropriation
</p>
<p>This section examines a number of cases that have been characterised as 
biopiracy or misappropriation, or questioned along these lines. They provide 
a useful point of examination regarding the way traditional knowledge may be 
used in the innovation process in different sectors (plant breeding, agriculture, 
medicines and cosmetics).
</p>
<p>(a) The Basmati Case &mdash; Plant Breeding and Innovation
</p>
<p>South Asia has a long history of domestication and breeding of rice. For 
example, archaeological evidence indicates that rice has been cultivated in India 
from between 1500 and 1000 BC.10 More specifically, basmati rice cultivars have 
been grown in South Asia, across India, Pakistan and also Bangladesh, probably 
for centuries, during which time they have been improved by local farmers 
through seed selection and conventional breeding practices. One of the earliest 
mentions of basmati is in the epic Heer and Ranjha composed in 1766. The most 
widely used rice variety &mdash; basmati 370 &mdash; was selected from local collections 
and released for commercial cultivation in 1933 at the Rice Research Station 
Kalashah Kaku (now Pakistan).11

<p>4 . Biopiracy and the Innovations of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities 
</p>
<p>83
</p>
<p>The basmati rice &lsquo;biopiracy&rsquo; controversy emerged in the late 1990s in response to a 
US patent. Specifically, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted patent 
number 5,663,484 on &lsquo;Basmati rice lines and grains&rsquo; to the Texas-based company 
RiceTec Inc. on 2 September 1997. Originally the patent had twenty claims on the 
protected subject matter, covering the &lsquo;novel&rsquo; basmati varieties that the researchers 
claimed to have developed. Unsurprisingly, this caused significant alarm and outrage 
amongst Indian farmers and NGOs. At the time, many interpreted the patent to mean 
an outright monopoly on basmati and thus restrictions on export to the US where 
the patent had been approved. As Ghosh notes, RiceTec&rsquo;s claims were for a specific 
rice plant (Claims 1&ndash;11, 14), for seeds that germinate the patented rice plant (Claim 
12), for the grain that is produced by the rice plant (Claims 13, 15&ndash;17), and for the 
method of selecting plants for breeding and propagating particular grains of rice 
(Claims 18&ndash;20).12 The overly broad wording and scope of the patent can be blamed 
for much of the public outrage.13
</p>
<p>Shortly after the patent was granted, Indian NGOs began a campaign against 
it, garnering support from the Indian government and drawing international 
attention to the patent. A re-examination application was filed by an organisation 
named the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development 
Authority in India, with government support.14 Subsequently, RiceTec agreed to 
withdraw some claims, and under a re-examination certificate (4525, 29 January 
2002) these were formally retracted. Claims 1&ndash;7, 10 and 14&ndash;20 were cancelled, 
and descriptions of the rice were altered in the certificate. However, Claims 8, 9 
and 11 for specific novel rice lines were maintained.
</p>
<p>Analysis of the description in the patent document indicates that Claims 8, 9 and 
11 refer to crossed rice lines (varieties) to develop plant varieties that exhibit 
some similar characteristics to basmati rice grains. Most countries in the world 
do not allow plant patents, but under US patent law novel plant varieties are 
eligible for protection. South Asian activists are particularly frustrated by this, 
because it appears that the germplasm used to cross the varieties was originally 
obtained from the region. The patent description for the breeding of BAS-867 
and RT1117 rice lines indicates that:
</p>
<p>Twenty-two basmati lines from the USDA World Germplasm Collection, 
Beltsville, Md. and thirteen semi-dwarf, long-grain lines were selected 
for the initial crosses &hellip; The basmati seed from the USDA were identified 
as having come from Pakistan.15

<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>84
</p>
<p>Activists such as Vandana Shiva have continued to argue that a simple cross-
breed such as this is obvious to someone trained in plant breeding (and so it 
fails to achieve an inventive step), and that it is also not novel (new) because it 
free-rides on the existing prior art in the basmati rice&rsquo;s qualities.16 However, the 
US standards of novelty and obviousness failed to recognise the contributions of 
Indian farmers as applied by the USPTO.17 This brings us to our question about 
innovation: how is the plant breeding by the US researchers any more inventive 
than the breeding done by the South Asian farmers? The main difference is that 
one is a new cross-breed and the other is presumably a traditionally bred strain 
(improved slowly over generations through selection and more recent empirical 
breeding practices). But this does not negate the obviousness requirement, and 
we might well ask: &lsquo;Is the crossing of these specific cultivar lines for desirable 
traits an inherently obvious activity to someone trained in plant breeding?&rsquo; 
Shiva thinks yes, and the innovation and IP policy-makers of many governments 
probably also agree.18 The answer comes down to jurisdiction: an &lsquo;inventive&rsquo; 
crossed hybrid will be allowed under the US plant patent rules but not under 
many other patent systems. For many, the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; empirical breeding of a 
cultivar might be seen as just as inventive as modern crosses, albeit through a 
slower (but nevertheless systematic) process. 
</p>
<p>(b) The Bolivian Habanero Pepper and Plant Variety 
Protection
</p>
<p>The previous example suggests a basic structural problem with the idea of &lsquo;plant 
patents&rsquo; and the obviousness/inventiveness of plant varieties derived from 
different types of breeding practices. Here we examine the role of plant variety 
protection (PVP) as providing a similarly problematic structural incentive to 
free-ride on the breeding practices of others. In this case, a pepper (Capsicum 
chinense) cultivar was bred from a cross between an orange habanero pepper 
from the Yukatan Peninsula and a pepper from a US Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) gene bank with Plant Introduction (PI) number 543188 collected from 
Bolivia. This was then filed with the US Plant Variety Protection Office database 
with PVP number 200400329 for the &lsquo;TAM Mild Habanero Pepper&rsquo; and issued 
in 2007.

17 As some authors have noted, see S Kadidal &lsquo;United States Patent Prior Art Rules and the Neem Controversy: 
A Case of Subject-Matter Imperialism&rsquo; (1998) 7(1) Biodiversity and Conservation 29. United States patent law 
does not recognise foreign prior art unless it is clearly documented and accessible. The geographical limitation 
on novelty is problematic in many biopiracy cases involving United States patents, particularly with regard to 
public knowledge or use of inventions in foreign countries which, in many cases, is orally transmitted rather 
than published or patented.

<p>4 . Biopiracy and the Innovations of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities 
</p>
<p>85
</p>
<p>The Texas A&amp;M University System Agriculture Program put out an &lsquo;AgNews&rsquo; 
press release on the pepper on 12 August 2004, describing it as a successfully 
bred mild version of the infamously hot and piquant habanero pepper. From a 
five-year breeding programme, the progeny of a cross &lsquo;between a hot Yukatan 
habanero and a heatless habanero from Bolivia began to show promise&rsquo;.19 
Breeders from the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station have indicated their 
excitement at the possibility of selling the habaneros to salsa companies and as a 
fresh product at between $3 and $4 per pound, while the comparable jalapenos 
peppers fetch around 50 cents per pound.20
</p>
<p>Here it is worth questioning whether the uniqueness of this mild habanero 
can be put down to the variety collected in Bolivia. The Texan breeders have 
obtained the germplasm from a USDA gene bank, and this is documented in the 
PVP certificate and admitted in their press release. The US Genetic Resources 
Information Network (GRIN) database record indicates that the original variety 
(GRIN PI 543188) is &lsquo;not piquant&rsquo; and that it is &lsquo;said to be grown locally&rsquo; in 
Bolivia. The records indicate that the original variety was purchased by a USDA 
official from a Brazilian vendor in the Cobija market of Nicolas Suarez Province 
(Pando Department) which borders Brazil on 13 November 1988. The plant 
material was then transferred to the USDA Plant Genetic Resources Conservation 
Unit in Georgia, and later accessed by the Texan breeders.
</p>
<p>In this case a PVP certificate was obtained. It has different requirements from 
a plant patent. If this were a patent, an obviousness requirement might well 
have seen it rejected on the grounds that one of the parent plants contained 
substantially similar traits. Instead, there are requirements for the registered 
plant variety to be new, distinct, uniform and stable21 in order to receive 
twenty years of protection. This means that there is little to prove in terms of 
&lsquo;innovation&rsquo; except for the distinctness of the plant:
</p>
<p>The distinctness of one variety from another may be based on one or 
more identifiable morphological, physiological, or other characteristics 
(including any characteristics evidenced by processing or product 
characteristics, such as milling and baking characteristics in the case of 
wheat) with respect to which a difference in genealogy may contribute 
evidence.22
</p>
<p>Conceivably, the cross-breeding may have changed the colour and look of the 
new variety from the original habanero. But in this case it appears that the most

</p>
<p>interesting or novel trait is that this habanero is non-piquant, a feature already 
present in the Bolivian parent &mdash; in all likelihood bred and &lsquo;grown locally&rsquo; in 
Bolivia for exactly that trait.23 In terms of innovation, we again have to question 
whether the law in place &mdash; this time a PVP law &mdash; is appropriate in rewarding 
something as being unique or &lsquo;distinct&rsquo; when in fact it may have only minor 
differences with the original or parent variety. Is this not just a case of allowing 
and legitimising free-riding on the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; innovation and breeding of 
Bolivians?
</p>
<p>(c) Artemisia judaica &mdash; The Limits of Traditional 
Knowledge
</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that while traditional knowledge may make substantial 
contributions to the innovation process, it is also important not to over-
romanticise traditional knowledge. While those decrying biopiracy incidents 
are often pointing out failures in the ethical practices of bioprospectors and 
&lsquo;innovators&rsquo;, or the failings of both biological resources and IP laws, there are 
plenty of examples where they may overstate the injustice.24 US patent number 
6,350,478 on an &lsquo;Artemisia judaica fractionation method&rsquo;, which is registered 
by the UK company Phytotech Ltd (a subsidiary of PhytopharmPlc), is worth 
examining for exactly this purpose.
</p>
<p>This patent became a topic of controversy following a report produced by the 
Washington DC-based NGO, the Edmonds Institute and the African Centre for 
Biosafety, called &lsquo;Out of Africa: Mysteries of Access and Benefit-Sharing&rsquo;.25 
This report portrays the US patent in respect of Artemisia judaica as one of 
the mysteries of ABS. Notably, the plant Artemisia judaica has been used in 
Libya and other neighbouring North African and Middle Eastern countries as 
a traditional medicine. There is considerable documented prior art regarding 
the traditional medicinal uses of the plant, including treatments for diabetes.26 
</p>
<p>23 There are a number of documents that indicate the extent of breeding and use of cultivars of the Capsicum 
chinense species, including the habanero pepper in South and Central America. B Pickersgill, &lsquo;Relationships 
Between Weedy and Cultivated Forms in Some Species of Chili Peppers (Genus Capsicum)&rsquo; (1971) 25 Evolution 
683, indicates that archaeological excavations have placed sedentary people practising agriculture east of 
the Andes, possibly as early as 2000 BC, indicating that it was probably these people who first domesticated 
cultivars of the Capsicum chinense species. Articles such as those by M J McLeod et al,&lsquo;Early Evolution of Chili 
Peppers (Capsicum)&rsquo; (1982) 36 Economic Botany 361; P W Bosland, &lsquo;Capsicums: Innovative Uses of an Ancient 
Crop&rsquo; in J Janick (ed), Progress in New Crops (ASHS Press, 1996) also indicate that the likely place of origin 
of the domesticated Capsicum chinense cultivars are the lowland Amazon Basin, with a potential range across 
Central America, South America and the Caribbean, see Robinson, above n 9.

<p>4 . Biopiracy and the Innovations of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities 
</p>
<p>87
</p>
<p>McGown cites part of the patent description: &lsquo;Artemis judaica is used in Libyan 
traditional medicine as an infusion for the treatment of &ldquo;wasting disease&rdquo;, 
almost certain[ly] dia[b]etes mellitus.&rsquo;27 But what he does not explain is that the 
patent in question covers only a series of methods for extraction of fractions 
from the Artemisia judaica plant &mdash; it is a process patent.
</p>
<p>This raises an important question: can process patents really be called biopiracy? 
If we take the biopiracy typology above, a process patent does not qualify as 
patent-based biopiracy (but potentially fits the misappropriation depiction). 
However, in terms of a broader question of justice, process patents can still 
potentially be used to restrain a very wide array of research activity, especially 
if the invention claims are broadly described. The existence of the patent or the 
threat of lawsuits can stifle the interests of others, given that it is really beyond 
the costs of indigenous communities to challenge these patents in court. There 
are several examples where the threat of a lawsuit has deterred indigenous or 
local producers, including a kwao krua process patent in Thailand28 and the 
yellow enola bean example affecting Mexican producers.29
</p>
<p>If we look to the Nagoya Protocol, the process patent does not raise any explicit 
conflict on its own. But presumably the researchers obtained the biological 
materials from Libya or a neighbouring country to conduct the research, and 
the way they extracted those materials is unknown. Surprisingly, the broader 
terms of the WIPO Draft Provisions description of misappropriation might 
depict this patent as such for &lsquo;deriving commercial benefit from the acquisition 
or appropriation of traditional knowledge&rsquo;. However, we do not know if it was 
acquired through &lsquo;unfair&rsquo; means.
</p>
<p>In any case, there are important details in the patent itself that need further 
examination. The chromatographic fractions derived from this patented process 
are claimed to have &lsquo;non-mutagenic properties&rsquo;. Other patent documents which 
cite the anti-diabetic properties of the Artemisia judaica plant30 note the presence 
of a &lsquo;deleterious mutagen&rsquo; in crude extracts of the plant, which would make it 
unsuitable for the treatment of mammals and humans. It seems that traditional 
healers may have been using it without clear knowledge of the potential for 
mutagenic effects.31 While traditional knowledge has probably led scientists to 
this plant as a treatment for diabetes, the severe side-effects could be identified 
and removed only through modern scientific techniques &mdash; chromatographic

</p>
<p>analysis in this case. In this sense, both &lsquo;traditional medicine&rsquo; and modern 
science needed each other to provide a useful and safe innovation (which in any 
case does not yet appear to have come to market).
</p>
<p>According to patent rules, this innovation would appear to satisfy the novelty 
and non-obviousness requirements. What is less clear is the consent and benefit-
sharing process. As McGown points out, Phytopharm says that it maintains 
good agricultural practices to minimise environmental impacts by &lsquo;working 
with local agronomists and horticulturalists in each of the countries where we 
are growing crops&rsquo;.32 Yet the company does not specify further than this vague 
assurance. If the company does derive commercial benefit from this valid patent, 
then there is still a considerable argument for some sort of return benefit sharing 
to &lsquo;provider&rsquo; groups for the partial contribution towards a useful end product.
</p>
<p>(d) White Kwao Krua &mdash; Yet Another Bad Patent?
</p>
<p>There have been a number of claimed patents over the Thai vine &lsquo;White Kwao 
Krua&rsquo; (Pueraria mirifica) that have received considerable criticism in the Thai 
media.33 Some quite broad patents have been granted in the US and Japan on 
extracts of the plant used in compositions for treating the skin. For example, 
US patents with numbers 6,673,377 and 6,352,685 both claim an extract 
derived from Pueraria mirifica &mdash; a solvent and dry solid respectively &mdash; for 
use as a cosmetic ingredient that may help reduce wrinkles. These have received 
criticism with regards to novelty, obviousness, and use of biological resources 
and traditional knowledge without clear ABS procedures.
</p>
<p>Yet another patent was granted in the US on 9 February 2010, with patent 
number 7,658,955 for &lsquo;Pueraria candollei var. mirifica A Shaw. &amp; Suvat. Extract&rsquo;. 
The claims are on a process for obtaining a dry extract, and the extract itself, for 
use in a cosmetic application. The authors of the patent attempt to differentiate 
this from the other patents and from the traditional application by claiming a 
dry extract that does not cause eye irritation. The claims do not appear to be 
particularly inventive in light of the prior art in the field &mdash; the descriptions of 
traditional medicinal use and the other patents. The patent even recognises the 
traditional medicinal use of kwao krua:
</p>
<p>For more than 500 years, people in South East Asia have been using the 
root of &lsquo;White Kwao Krua&rsquo; for its profound anti-aging properties. This 
root has been identified as Puerariacandollei var. mirifica Airy Shaw et 
Suvat, which belongs to the family Papilionaceae (Leguminosae).

<p>However, they do not indicate whether they are the ones who identified the 
specific variant of the species &mdash; it seems highly unlikely that they are, and 
the variant is widely known in Northern Thailand. Figure 6 is a photo taken of

<p>Their claim hinges on the extract of the specific variant of the Pueraria genus. 
They indicate: &lsquo;The only species with distinct estrogenic activity was found to be

or P. mirifica).&rsquo; They then contradictorily indicate that: &lsquo;The required species of </p>

</p>
<p>90
</p>
<p>the present invention is not &ldquo;Pueraria mirifica&rdquo; but Pueraria candollei var. 
mirifica A Shaw. &amp; Suvat.&rsquo; One has to wonder if a patent examiner actually read 
this document before granting the patent.
</p>
<p>If we do a simple search for existing literature about &lsquo;White Kwao Krua&rsquo;, many 
prior art documents appear, going back to 1931. In English, an article by 
Kashemsanta et al. from 1952 describes the identification of the species sent from 
Thailand to Kew Gardens: &lsquo;Pueraria mirifica Airy Shaw et Suvatabandhu, sp. 
Nov., P. Candollei Grah.&rsquo; This is likely to be the same plant &mdash; in fact, the variant 
&lsquo;Airy Shaw and Suvathabandhu&rsquo; is apparently named after two of the authors. 
The plant is also described by Cherdshewasart (one of the US patent holders 
of other kwao krua patents) and colleagues in two recent articles as &lsquo;Pueraria 
mirifica Airy Shaw et Suvatabandhu (synonymn: Pueraria candollei Wall. Ex 
Benth var mirifica (Airy Shaw &amp; Suvat)&rsquo;, which is likely to be a description of 
the same plant.34 These authors also note the identification of miroestrol, one of 
the phytoestrogens that is a key active of the plant, also listed as one of the key 
actives in the claims in the new US patent 7,658,955.
</p>
<p>A few conclusions can be drawn from this case. First, there appear to be serious 
issues relating to prior art and obviousness in the case of this new patent. 
Secondly, all of these &lsquo;White Kwao Krua&rsquo; patents are utilising traditional 
medicinal knowledge towards commercial gain &mdash; and they even acknowledge 
this. In these patents, the inventors have isolated the active ingredients &mdash; 
certain phytoestrogens &mdash; and have altered dosage levels to improve safety for 
human usage. Yet none of this identification would have been possible without 
the contributions made by traditional Thai healers who have experimented with 
the plant and transmitted knowledge of it going back about a century (if not 
further). Certainly there is scope to make scientific improvements for the safe 
application of this herbal product as a cream. But are these patentable? Aren&rsquo;t the 
links between &lsquo;traditional medicine&rsquo; and &lsquo;modern cosmetic&rsquo; blindingly obvious 
and in need of adequate recognition? The Thai government has established 
ABS requirements (under their PVP Act) as well as a Thai Traditional and 
Alternative Medicines Act with the aim of ensuring that traditional medicines 
are appropriately promoted and protected. To date it does not appear that there 
are any ABS arrangement between the researchers and the Thai government 
in relation to this plant. In the meantime, the white kwao krua plant has 
been heavily poached from forest areas as a result of recent public demand, 
highlighting the importance of ABS contributions to the conservation of useful 
species.

</p>
<p>4. Conclusions
</p>
<p>In three of the four cases discussed, the United States IP system, whether through 
patents or plant variety protection, has provided monopoly protection for 
&lsquo;innovations&rsquo; that are incremental at best. The Artemisia case, although making 
an apparently more substantial inventive contribution, still has shortened its 
R&amp;D process through the use of traditional knowledge (relating to diabetes 
treatment, although also potentially severe in its side-effects). The Artemisia 
case does, however, indicate that scientific and traditional innovation systems 
can interact in mutually beneficial ways. What is important is that the terms 
of the exchange between different parties is &lsquo;fair and equitable&rsquo;. Indeed, there 
are more cases emerging wherein researchers or companies have successfully 
established mutually beneficial arrangements with indigenous communities (for 
example, the commercial use of Argan oil for cosmetics by Cognis and L&rsquo;Oreal).35
</p>
<p>However, what is frustrating about the cases described in this chapter 
(and in many other biopiracy cases) is that the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; contribution to 
the innovation is poorly recognised at best (as in the kwao krua case) and 
completely ignored in others. If we stopped thinking of the indigenous peoples&rsquo; 
contributions as &lsquo;traditional knowledge&rsquo; and formally recognised &lsquo;indigenous 
innovation&rsquo;, we may well find some patents and plant variety certificates are 
never actually granted because of their lack of novelty. We may find that 
inventiveness and obviousness are perceived differently if patent examiners are 
able to peer through the guise of &lsquo;technical&rsquo; language to see that the wheel is 
being continually re-invented. For example:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The remaining patented basmati rice lines could not be produced without 
the long-term breeding innovations of South Asia farmers.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The protected cross-breed of habanero pepper almost certainly would not 
have such unique traits without the breeding contributions of Bolivian 
farmers.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The Artemisia researchers would not have identified the plant as a diabetes 
treatment without the use of traditional medicinal knowledge (albeit 
apparently unaware of mutagenic effects).
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The white kwao krua plant would not continually be re-processed in different 
forms to serve the same purpose &mdash; as a cosmetic that reduces wrinkles &mdash; 
without the experimentation of Thai healers.
</p>
<p>This highlights the importance of initiatives such as the Traditional Knowledge 
Digital Library (TKDL) which is clearly starting to make an impression on the

</p>
<p>minds of examiners in the European Patent Office and Canadian Intellectual 
Property Office, with several patents withdrawn or set aside due to the influence 
of the TKDL. While this is an important achievement on its own, this initiative 
is likely to stop only patent-based biopiracy or &lsquo;bad patents&rsquo;, and will not 
prevent misappropriations or non-patent biopiracy, or provide mechanisms for 
the active promotion of the innovations of indigenous and local communities.
</p>
<p>Drahos has made useful suggestions towards a treaty on Traditional Group 
Knowledge and Practice (TGKP).36 He suggests in his conclusions that a 
treaty should focus on the enforcement dimension of TGKP, being modest in 
setting substantive standards but strong on coordinating national enforcement 
activities for the prevention of misappropriation of traditional knowledge 
through a Global Bio-Collecting Society. Given that there have been some 
considerable successes at the national level in Peru with the establishment 
of an &lsquo;Anti-Biopiracy Commission&rsquo; which has investigated and lobbied for 
the successful withdrawal of several foreign patents that utilised biological 
resources and associated traditional knowledge or innovation, such a concept 
might prove useful if expanded internationally (at least for preventing patent-
based biopiracy). Irrespective of whether an international system is in place, 
the development of national biopiracy and/or misappropriation ombudsmen 
would be a useful step for countries in which it has been a persistent problem. 
In fact, this idea was raised in the ABS negotiations prior to Nagoya, but was 
unfortunately dropped late in the negotiations in order to reach a compromise.
</p>
<p>Despite some flaws, the Nagoya Protocol is an obvious step towards positive 
outcomes of ABS, and will hopefully result in some benefits for &lsquo;traditional 
knowledge holders&rsquo; and for conservation, as well as adequate respect for their 
contributions through prior informed consent procedures. What might also be 
useful are sui generis systems for the protection and promotion of the innovations 
of indigenous peoples and local communities that are less prescriptive than 
IP laws and which reflect customary mechanisms of protection. However, the 
promise of custom-based sui generis systems is likely to be also hamstrung by 
the jurisprudential diversity of the many indigenous groups around the world.37
</p>
<p>Lastly, while it might seem biased to square this criticism directly at the US 
(which is certainly not the only country guilty of allowing or legitimising 
biopiracy), the USPTO has consistently proven itself to be an open door for 
anything remotely resembling an invention. As Quillen and Webster note,

countries in the world yet to ratify the CBD. With the agreement of the Nagoya 
Protocol, the rest of the world is now preparing to implement a comprehensive 
international regime on ABS, which will have one glaring absentee. We must let 
the US Government know that this is unacceptable.

<p>5. Indigenous Cultural Heritage and 
Fair Trade: Voluntary Certification 
</p>
<p>Standards in the Light of WIPO and 
WTO Law and Policy-making 
</p>
<p>Christoph B . Graber and Jessica C . Lai
</p>
<p>1. Introduction
</p>
<p>For a long time, the issue of trading indigenous cultural heritage (ICH)1 was 
discussed with a defensive attitude. The question was generally how indigenous 
peoples could be protected against third parties misappropriating their 
knowledge assets in national or international trade. Academic writings adopting 
this approach seconded indigenous peoples fighting against old injustices 
stemming from unresolved problems of colonisation and a subjugation of their 
culture under Western law. Only very recently has a new wave of scholarship 
started to challenge this type of defensive thinking and tackle the issue of 
trading ICH from the development perspective.2 The question now is how trade 
in ICH can contribute to the economic and social development of indigenous 
peoples. The idea behind this approach is that an active participation in the 
trade of traditional cultural expressions (TCEs) and other traditional knowledge 
(TK) would offer indigenous peoples not only a source of income &mdash; allowing for 
a reduction of government aid dependency &mdash; but also a means for becoming 
architects of their proper future and, thus, increasing their sense of identity 
and dignity. Because ICH is a multidimensional asset, an important precondition 
for such indigenous empowerment would certainly be that the decision about 
which TCE can be traded and which TCE &mdash; because of its sacred or otherwise 
important meaning for a community &mdash; must not enter the market is a prerogative 
of the respective TCE- and TK-owning indigenous community.
</p>
<p>1 Whereas indigenous cultural and intellectual property (ICIP) is a term also used to describe the subject 
matter, indigenous peoples often prefer to speak of indigenous cultural heritage (ICH). Accordingly, the latter 
term is used in this chapter.
2 An important step in this development was the launch of the Swiss National Science Foundation funded 
&lsquo;International Trade in Indigenous Cultural Heritage&rsquo; research project in December 2009 at the University 
of Lucerne. This multi-year, international and trans-disciplinary project investigates how international law 
could be adjusted to allow indigenous peoples to actively participate in international trade with their cultural 
heritage without being constrained to renounce important traditional values. For more information see

<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>96
</p>
<p>Recent developments at the level of international law and policy-making support 
efforts to view trade in ICH from a development perspective to some extent. 
The agenda of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) &mdash; as far as 
it deals with TK (including the relationship with the Convention on Biological 
Diversity (CBD))&mdash; and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) are both sensitive to development considerations.3 
Neither organisation, however, is much concerned with indigenous issues in 
particular.4 The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has recently 
included the development dimension into its agenda, and the documents 
produced by its Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and 
Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (IGC) since 2001 show 
that development is taken seriously.5 However, the IGC has been reluctant to 
clarify whether interests of indigenous peoples should be treated in a privileged 
manner. 
</p>
<p>An important shortcoming of all current initiatives at the international level is 
that they increase rather than reduce the existing fragmentation of the relevant 
law on ICH. There is also a risk that these top-down initiatives will be difficult 
to implement, since indigenous and non-indigenous stakeholders may have 
diverging views even on central matters of regulation. This chapter endeavours 
to take up an idea that has little been studied so far: that is, exploring the 
potential of bottom-up approaches, including private initiatives of voluntary 
certification standards, as alternatives to top-down approaches in the field of 
ICH and development. An interesting question to be addressed is whether the 
very successful Fairtrade labelling system could be extended to trade in ICH 
in a way likely to be accepted by indigenous peoples. A further question will 
be how such voluntary certification standards would relate to WIPO&rsquo;s draft 
provisions on TK/TCEs, and whether they would be in conformity with WTO/
TRIPS law and policy-making.

<p>3 Strengthening the contribution of culture to sustainable development has been a goal of UNESCO 
policy-making since the launch of World Decade for Cultural Development (1988&ndash;1998). For most recent 
developments see below n 10.
4 Although UNESCO stresses that its &lsquo;activities with indigenous peoples are framed by its missions to 
protect and promote cultural diversity, encourage intercultural dialogue and enhance linkages between 
culture and development&rsquo;, see &lt;http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35393&amp;URL_DO=DO_
TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html&gt;, its Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of 
Cultural Expressions (CCD) (UNESCO, 2005), does not respond sufficiently to the interests of indigenous 
peoples. This is because the CCD was designed by its drafters to protect national entertainment industries 
rather than creative expressions of indigenous peoples. Indeed, a reference to TCE and indigenous peoples 
was introduced only at a late stage of the negotiations. Although the adopted text does mention TCE and 
indigenous peoples a few times, the relevant provisions do not address the rights of the indigenous peoples 
themselves, but those of the states whose territory is affected. See C B Graber, &lsquo;Institutionalization of Creativity 
in Traditional Societies and in International Trade Law&rsquo; in S Ghosh and R P Malloy (eds), Creativity, Law and 
Entrepreneurship (Edward Elgar, 2011) 234, 247-248.

<p>2. ICH International Policy-making and the 
Problem of Top-down Approaches
</p>
<p>As most indigenous peoples appear in the lower end of socioeconomic 
statistics, the potential to generate an income from the trade of their cultural 
heritage &mdash; such as their designs, dances, songs, stories and sacred artwork 
&mdash; is not insignificant to their wellbeing. As recent research (including the 
Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development)6 shows, there 
is evidence &lsquo;that economic development in Indian Country has finally gained 
traction across many reservations only after policies of self-determination took 
effect&rsquo;.7 Similarly, we take the view that trade in indigenous knowledge assets 
may promote social and economic development of indigenous communities,8 
provided that such trade is controlled by them.9 The requirement that indigenous 
communities decide beforehand whether a certain part of their cultural heritage 
may be traded must be a conditio sine qua non. The new scholarly approach 
to look at trade in ICH from a development perspective fits well with the 
growing international awareness of policy-makers that intellectual property (IP) 
and cultural expressions may be an important driver of social and economic 
development, including for indigenous peoples. As a follow-up to the 2010 UN 
Millennium Summit, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution 
on culture and development on 20 December 2010.10 The resolution emphasises 
the important contribution of culture for sustainable development, and for the 
achievement of national and international development objectives, including 
the Millennium Development Goals.11 The 2008 UN Creative Economy Report 
</p>
<p>6 The Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development has undertaken a comprehensive, 
systematic and comparative study of social, economic and political conditions of American Indian reservations 
over the last 20 years. See E C Henson et al (eds), The State of the Native Nations: Conditions under U.S. Policies 
of Self-determination (Oxford University Press, 2008).

8 For a more sceptical view on the question whether such commercialisation would be desirable as a 
consequence for indigenous peoples, see R K Paterson and D S Karjala, &lsquo;Looking Beyond Intellectual Property 
in Resolving Protection of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; (2003) 11 Cardozo Journal 
of International and Comparative Law 633, 634.
9 The requirement that trade in ICH must be controlled by indigenous communities is reflected at the level 
of international law by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The 
UNDRIP emphasises collective rights of indigenous self-determination and self-government, including in 
cultural matters. Although the UNDRIP is not a binding instrument of international law and does not create 
new rights, it provides for a detailing and interpretation of the human rights enshrined in other international 
human rights instruments with universal resonance. See C B Graber, &lsquo;Aboriginal Self-Determination vs. the 
Propertisation of Traditional Culture: The Case of Sacred Wanjina Sites&rsquo; (2009) 13(2) Australian Indigenous 
Law Review 18, 27.

<p>emphasised the link between the economy and culture as a &lsquo;new development 
paradigm&rsquo;,12 and WIPO started to look at IP from a development perspective 
in the framework of the WIPO Development Agenda.13 The scope of the latter 
includes knowledge assets of indigenous peoples in developing and developed 
countries. Development is also an issue in ongoing WIPO negotiations within 
the IGC, eventually leading to binding or non-binding international instruments 
on TK, genetic resources and TCEs.14
</p>
<p>Although the discussions in the WIPO IGC on TCEs and TK have been ongoing for 
over ten years, little progress has been made. After twenty sessions of the IGC,15 
no agreement is in view even with regard to the key objectives and principles of 
the new TCE (and TK) instrument, and views diverge between indigenous and 
non-indigenous stakeholders and often even between indigenous communities. 
For indigenous peoples, one central question is whether the new instruments 
should also extend to TCEs and TK of a non-indigenous origin. A further issue 
is that creating new WIPO instruments on TCEs and TK risks increasing rather 
than reducing the existing fragmentation of the relevant law on ICH. These 
difficulties have provoked critical comments questioning the feasibility of any 
top-down solution to the problem.16 Taking such criticism seriously, in this 
</p>
<p>12 According to the UN Creative Economy Report, The Challenge of Assessing the Creative Economy: 
Towards Informed Policy-making, UN Doc UNCTAD/DITC/2008/2 (2008), 3 &lsquo;a new development paradigm is 
emerging that links the economy and culture, embracing economic, cultural, technological and social aspects 
of development at both the macro and micro levels. Central to the new paradigm is the fact that creativity, 
knowledge and access to information are increasingly recognized as powerful engines driving economic 
growth and promoting development in a globalizing world.&rsquo; Chapter 6.4 of the report explicitly deals with 
TCEs. The report was drafted jointly by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 
and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in cooperation with UNESCO, WIPO and International 
Trade Centre (ITC).
13 The WIPO Development Agenda was established by the WIPO General Assembly in October 2007. It 
includes a set of 45 recommendations designed to enhance the development dimension of the organisation&rsquo;s 
activities. Recommendation 18 (related to norm-setting, flexibilities, public policy and public domain) urges 
the IGC &lsquo;to accelerate the process on the protection of genetic resources, traditional knowledge and folklore, 
without prejudice to any outcome, including the possible development of an international instrument or 
instruments&rsquo;. In addition to the adoption of the Development Agenda, WIPO member states also approved 
a recommendation to establish a Committee on Development and Intellectual Property. See generally the 
chapters in N W Netanel (ed), The Development Agenda: Global Intellectual Property and Developing Countries 
(Oxford University Press, 2009).
14 The idea of &lsquo;development&rsquo; underlies the whole WIPO Draft on the protection of TCE. To this end, two 
objectives of the draft are relevant: objective (iii), which aims to &lsquo;contribute to the welfare and sustainable 
economic, cultural, environmental and social development of such peoples and communities&rsquo;; and objective 
(xi), which aims to promote the development of indigenous peoples and communities and &lsquo;legitimate trading 
activities&rsquo;. Objective (xi) promotes the use of TCE for the development of indigenous peoples and communities, 
where desired by them. Moreover, the objective recognises the TCE as &lsquo;an asset of the communities that 
identify with them, such as through the development and expansion of marketing opportunities for tradition-
based creations and innovations&rsquo;. See WIPO IGC Secretariat, The Protection of Traditional Cultural Expression/
Expression of Folklore: Revised Objectives and Principles,WIPO Doc WIPO/GRTKF/IC/17/4 (2010).

<p>chapter we take up Peter Drahos&rsquo;s suggestion to think also about alternative 
bottom-up approaches to commercialising ICH.17 Since the prevention of fakes 
and reducing the market share of imitations would be crucial to enhance trade in 
ICH, international law could assist indigenous peoples through the establishment 
of a system of origin certification that would work at the international level.
</p>
<p>Such a strategy may also find support from indigenous brokers, since the United 
Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues recommended, in a 2003 report, 
that states should promote &lsquo;the knowledge, application and dissemination of 
appropriate technologies and indigenous peoples&rsquo; local products with certificates 
of origin to activate product activities, as well as the use, management and 
conservation of natural resources&rsquo;.18 A prominent forum for discussing issues 
of origin of traditional knowledge assets is the CBD. Although the CBD focuses 
on TK that is associated with genetic resources, discussions on disclosure or 
certification of origin held therein may be relevant also for other forms of TK 
relating to the subject matter of IP applications. A report delivered by the United 
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on the invitation 
of the Seventh Conference of the Parties of the CBD19 shows that certificates 
of origin are important in the realm of the CBD &lsquo;to certify that the source of 
genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge has the authority to 
provide access on specified conditions, and also to certify the existence of ex 
ante benefit-sharing requirements that are compliant with the CBD and with 
relevant laws and equitable principles of the country providing such resources 
or knowledge&rsquo;.20 Beyond enabling access to TK associated with genetic resources 
and demonstrating prior informed consent and equitable benefit sharing (as a 
precondition for obtaining IP rights);21 certificates of origin may facilitate further 
commercial uses. If certificates of origin are linked with labelling systems or 
origin marks, they may be useful &lsquo;in promoting commercial recognition of the 
subject matter of intellectual property and in obtaining benefits for countries

<p>and indigenous or local communities that exercise rights over genetic resources 
and associated traditional knowledge&rsquo;.22 The report cautions, however, that this 
may raise difficult questions regarding the &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; standard to be applied.
</p>
<p>In fact, experiences with the Australian Authenticity Labels, certifying 
as &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; goods and services deriving from a work of art created by an 
indigenous person or people, were negative. What were the reasons for this 
failure? Fairtrade, another example of voluntary certification standards, is by 
contrast a big success. Why is this? Fairtrade certification and its system of 
minimum pricing were designed for commodity products. Could one nonetheless 
learn from this model to avoid flaws, such as those identified in the Australian 
Authenticity scheme, and develop a model that would meet the interests of both 
indigenous peoples and consumers in a global market? These questions will be 
addressed in the next section.
</p>
<p>3. Voluntary Certification Standards and ICH
</p>
<p>(a) Typical Features of a Voluntary Certification Standard
</p>
<p>In its most general description, a voluntary certification standard consists of 
three key elements, including: (1) voluntary standard-setting; (2) certification; 
and (3) labelling and marketing.23  When applied to ICH, an essential requirement 
would be that all three elements are controlled by indigenous communities. 
Accordingly, voluntary standard-setting would typically consist of a process 
whereby indigenous peoples agree on minimal requirements that select cultural 
goods or services should meet. These standard requirements could relate to 
the origin of a good or service, its physical properties, or the process through 
which it is produced or commercialised. Certification then would involve an 
independent body examining whether the good or service at issue would actually 
conform to the set standard. Finally, labelling would make the conformity of a 
good or service with the standard visible to suppliers, intermediate buyers or 
end consumers and would, thus, allow for a specifically designed marketing 
campaign. To protect the label against misuse, it could be registered as a regular 
trade mark or certification mark according to the national law that is applicable.

</p>
<p>(b) Why Did the Australian Authenticity Label Fail?
</p>
<p>Voluntary certification standards have been used in several countries as a means 
to promote trade in ICH.24 These had had varying success. For example, whereas 
the Alaskan &lsquo;Silver Hand&rsquo; certification mark has been around since 1961,25 the 
New Zealand &lsquo;Māori Made&rsquo;Toi Iho certification mark system was disinvested by 
the Government in 2009, as it had not achieved increased sales of Māori art by 
licensed artists or retailers.26 Since the Australian Authenticity Label has been 
widely commented upon, we will have a closer look at this scheme and ask why 
it failed only two years after its introduction.
</p>
<p>The Australian Authenticity Label was launched in 1999 along with a &lsquo;Label of 
Collaboration&rsquo;.27 The Label of Authenticity was for &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; goods or services 
which were &lsquo;derived from a work of art created by an Aboriginal or Torres Strait 
Islander person or people, [and] reproduced or produced and manufactured by 
Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people&rsquo;.28 The Label of Collaboration was 
for works that were a result of collaboration involving &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; creation by 
an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and reproduction or production and 
manufacture by non-indigenous persons, under a licence (for the copyright of 
the work) from a fair and legitimate agreement.29 The purpose of the Australian 
Authenticity Labels was to maximise consumers&rsquo; certainty &lsquo;that they were 
getting the genuine product&rsquo;,30 to promote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
authorship,31 and to help ensure a fair, equitable and improved return to 
indigenous authors.32
</p>
<p>24 Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Portugal are examples of countries where certification marks have 
been used to ensure the authenticity and quality of indigenous artefacts, see WIPO, Intellectual Property

<p>Both labels were registered as &lsquo;certification marks&rsquo; under the Australian Trade 
Marks Act.33 Whereas normal trade marks distinguish certain goods or services 
as those produced by a specific (natural or legal) person, certification marks 
indicate that the certified goods or services comply with a set of standards and 
have been certified by a certification authority.34 The marks were owned by 
the National Indigenous Arts Advocacy Association (NIAAA).35 The NIAAA 
was also the certification authority. In this function, the NIAAA certified that 
the protected goods or services complied with the required standard: that is, 
that they were or involved an &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; creation by an Australian indigenous 
person.36
</p>
<p>The first step required for use of the marks was registration to the NIAAA. 
To register an artwork or similar product, an artist had to show that he or she 
identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Artists also had to show that 
they indeed were indigenous by descent through providing two signed forms 
certified by an Aboriginal corporation and passed at a meeting.37 They also 
had to show that they were accepted as indigenous by a community, and had 
permission from the relevant community to make the artwork or product.38 For 
the Collaboration Label, the indigenous artist and the producer or manufacturer 
had to apply jointly.39 Once registered, the artist had permission to use the 
label on his or her artwork or product.40 Use had to comply with a set of rules, 
including that the works were created within indigenous customary law.41
</p>
<p>33 See Trade Marks Act 1995 s 169 (Cth) stating that:
A certification trade mark is a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services: 
(a) dealt with or provided in the course of trade; and 
(b) certified by a person (owner of the certification trade mark), or by another person approved by that person, in 
relation to quality, accuracy or some other characteristic, including (in the case of goods) origin, material or mode of 
manufacture; from other goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade but not so certified.

The NIAAA had indigenous leadership. However, this leadership was unstable and fluctuated constantly. 
Moreover, there was much debate as to whether the organisation was representative of all Aborigines, as it was 
perceived as a Sydney-based entity, rather than an association enjoying wider support. Email from Matthew

adviser before signing the agreement&rsquo;; and (2) &lsquo;whether the Indigenous person is required to assign their

</p>
<p>On the retail level, the two marks allowed an indigenous arts and crafts retailer 
to inform customers that he or she supported the Authenticity Labels and that 
his or her business operated under a NIAAA licence. Practically, this licensing 
arrangement was exhibited by a sticker to be affixed on shop windows or doors.42
</p>
<p>The two Authenticity Labels existed only for two years. According to 
commentators, there were a number of reasons for this failure, including 
difficulties in defining &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; and insufficient funding of the system&rsquo;s 
administration.43 Difficulties in defining and monitoring what fell into the term 
&lsquo;authentic&rsquo; were certainly the main factors in the system&rsquo;s failure.44 Definition 
involved value judgements about Aboriginal art and &mdash; as had been feared by 
members of the indigenous arts and crafts community &mdash; the distinction of 
two categories of authentic and non-authentic indigenous art.45 The NIAAA 
was criticised for introducing an &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; standard in a top-down way, 
without sufficient involvement of indigenous stakeholders.46 As a matter of fact, 
the NIAAA did not reflect that certain indigenous communities already had 
their own identification marks prior to the inception of the NIAAA marks.47 
Moreover, artists who were part of local or regional art centres or organisations 
did not feel that they needed the NIAAA labels to denote the &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; of 
their products.48 Thus, the labelling system was never widely accepted or used 
by the indigenous peoples of Australia.
</p>
<p>Commentators emphasised the impossibility of developing a common 
authenticity standard in an environment where there is little agreement among 
various indigenous groups regarding the concept of Aboriginal identity. In 
particular, rural and peripheral indigenous communities did not like the idea 
of a &lsquo;homogenising&rsquo; national labelling system.49 And many urban indigenous 
artists were concerned that &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; would denote indigenous art &lsquo;that 
employs traditional techniques, materials and imagery&rsquo;.50
</p>
<p>There were flaws not only in the definition of &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; but also in the 
implementation of the standard. According to commentators, the NIAAA&rsquo;s lack

<p>of independence made it too easy to show indigeneity and to get the marks.51 
It seems obvious that independence cannot be assured in an organisational 
structure where &mdash; as in the case of the NIAAA &mdash; the owner of the mark also 
sets the standards and acts as the certification body.
</p>
<p>Poor funding was considered to be a second main structural shortcoming of the 
Australian Authenticity scheme. Although the NIAAA received some funding 
from the Australia Council and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
Commission, these funds were not sufficient to establish the scheme at a national 
and international level.52 To make the labels work effectively, the NIAAA would 
have required more money for marketing campaigns to raise awareness of the 
labels among consumers and tourists.53 Commentators reckon that the lack of 
funding was also the reason all the responsibilities were given to the NIAAA 
rather than to a separate body established to undertake the certification role, as 
was recommended by Terri Janke prior to the launch of the labelling system.54
</p>
<p>Besides these structural flaws, there were also shortcomings in the implementation 
and administration of the Australian scheme through the NIAAA. As a result of 
allegations of misappropriated funds and failures of accountability, the federal 
government&rsquo;s funding to the NIAAA was discontinued.55 The Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander Arts Board of the Australia Council commissioned a 
review of the NIAAA in 2002.56 The review concluded that the NIAAA had poor 
governance and management, tended to focus on Sydney57 and under-represented 
other indigenous communities, set a problematic definition of &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo;, 
had problems implementing the system and failed to be financially accountable. 
The review also placed some blame on the funding agencies for not supervising 
the NIAAA and for creating a culture of non-accountability.58

for applications and labels. However, the A$30 registration for the Label of Authenticity and A$50 for the

<p>(c) Could One Learn from the Fairtrade Label?
</p>
<p>In comparison with the failure of the Australian Authenticity mark, the success 
of the Fairtrade label is striking. The history of the Fairtrade system goes back 
to 1988, when Max Havelaar was founded as the first Fairtrade label under the 
initiative of the Dutch development agency Solidaridad.59 In the late 1980s to 
early 1990s, this initiative was replicated in several other markets in Europe 
and North America, each with its own mark.60 To unite all the existing labelling 
initiatives under one umbrella, and harmonise standards and certification 
worldwide, in 1997 the Fairtrade Labelling Organization International (FLO) 
was established in Bonn, Germany.61 The different labels remained until 2002, 
when the FLO launched the international FAIRTRADE Certification Mark and 
the former labels were gradually replaced.62 Canada and the US still use their 
own labels.63
</p>
<p>An overall concern of the fair trade movement is to fight for global justice 
and to equalise the north&ndash;south divide of producers in the world market for 
commodity products.64 Accordingly, the purpose of the Fairtrade labelling 
system is to help small-scale farmers and workers in developing countries.65 
In addition to ensuring that suppliers are not unfairly exploited by the 
mechanisms of the global market, the Fairtrade system aims at contributing to 
social and environmental development in marginalised regions of the world.66 
From its beginning, a characteristic of the Fairtrade scheme was its grassroots 
collaborative approach.67 Producers jointly own and manage the FLO, and 
producers are members on the Board of Directors.68 Accordingly, producers 
determine the direction that Fairtrade will head towards, and decisions are taken 
</p>
<p>59 The history of Fairtrade is outlined by the FLO, History of Fairtrade (2011) &lt;http://www.fairtrade.net&gt;

65 Producers must come from countries with low to medium development status in Africa, Asia, Oceania, 
Latin America and the Caribbean. The products must come from small farmer organisations (small producers, 
small-scale farmers) who do not depend on hired workers all the time, but run their farm mainly by using 
their own and their family&rsquo;s labour. Companies with hired labour may apply for certain products. See FLO,

</p>
<p>in an open and inclusive fashion.69 In our view, the bottom-up, collaborative 
and open approach of the Fairtrade system makes an important contrast to the 
NIAAA and the Australian Authenticity Labels. As we have highlighted above, 
the NIAAA operated in a top-down manner, many indigenous communities 
were never consulted about the development of the marks, and most artists 
never felt that the mark was theirs.
</p>
<p>Stakeholder involvement is an important element of Fairtrade standards. 
Whereas the Australian scheme was based on a NIAAA-imposed standard of 
&lsquo;authenticity&rsquo;, Fairtrade standards are set in accordance with the ISEAL Code of 
Good Practice for Setting Social and Environmental Standards.70 According to 
ISEAL requirements, Fairtrade standard-setting processes are open, and involve 
the major stakeholders in the system, including producers and the FLO.71 There 
are two sets of Fairtrade standards, for two different types of disadvantaged 
producers.72 One applies to smallholders who are working together in cooperatives 
or other organisations with a democratic and participative structure. For these, 
a generic producer standard is that profits should be equally distributed among 
the producers. Furthermore, all members need to have a voice and vote in the 
organisation&rsquo;s decision-making process.73 The other set of standards applies 
to workers, whose employers pay decent wages, guarantee the right to join 
trade unions (freedom of association), ensure health and safety standards, 
and provide adequate housing where relevant. Fairtrade standards also cover 
terms of trade.74 Most products have a Fairtrade price, meaning that companies 
trading Fairtrade products must pay a minimum amount to the producers (to 
cover the costs of sustainable production).75 This price is periodically reviewed 
by the FLO.76 Producers also get an additional Fairtrade premium, which goes 
into a communal fund for workers and famers to invest in their communities: for 
example, for education or healthcare. The decision on how to do this is made 
democratically: for example, within a farmers&rsquo; organisation or by workers on a 
plantation.77 The standards also allow producers to request partial pre-payment 
of the contract.78 This is important for small-scale farmers&rsquo; organisations to 
</p>
<p>69 For example, when it was deciding on the future of the FAIRTRADE Mark, the FLO invited Fairtrade 
members, producers, traders and consumers to join them in developing a new strategy, see FLO, Making the 
Difference: The Global Strategy for Fairtrade (2009) &lt;http://www.fairtrade.se/obj/docpart/c/c6ad566a479f109
86c87188d237057d1.pdf&gt; 4. However, Hutchens concluded that the FLO is now so big and market orientated 
that it has &lsquo;effectively invalidated producer and FTO [Fair Trade Organization] voices/knowledge&rsquo;; Hutchens,

</p>
<p>ensure they have cash flow to pay farmers. Buyers are required to enter into 
trading relationships so that producers can predict their income and plan for 
the future.
</p>
<p>A second major difference between Fairtrade and the Australian scheme relates 
to the certification process. Whereas in the Australian scheme all functions were 
centralised in the NIAAA, in the Fairtrade system the process for certification 
is separate from the system&rsquo;s operational management and performed by FLO-
CERT.79 FLO-CERT is ISO 65 certified. ISO 65 is the leading, internationally 
recognised quality norm for bodies operating a product certification system.80 ISO 
65 certification guarantees: (1) the existence of a quality management system; (2) 
transparency in all processes; and (3) independence in the certification decision-
making. To ensure compliance with ISO 65 rules, FLO-CERT is checked by an 
independent third party. As part of the certification process, FLO-CERT inspects 
and certifies producer organisations, and audits traders to check whether they 
comply with the standards.81 The cost of audits &mdash; which also include on-site 
inspections of producers &mdash; is charged to the producer wanting to become 
part of the system. One important reason for the impressive dissemination of 
Fairtrade among marginalised producers is the financial and administrative 
assistance offered by FLO for initial applicants.82
</p>
<p>The marketing aspect is a third major difference between Fairtrade and the 
Australian scheme. Whereas poor national and international marketing was one 
of the reasons for the failure of the Australian Authenticity marks, the Fairtrade 
system&rsquo;s marketing concept is considered crucial for the success of the Fairtrade 
movement.83 The goodwill of Fairtrade is represented internationally by the 
FAIRTRADE Certification Mark, which is an internationally registered trade 
mark. The mark is a product label, mainly intended for use on the packaging 
of products that satisfy the Fairtrade standards.84 It allows consumers to buy 
products in line with their value judgements regarding justice in the north&ndash;
south divide.85 Consumers&rsquo; confidence in the FAIRTRADE mark and what it

</p>
<p>represents is assured by the high quality of the standardisation and certification 
processes, and the continued checking of compliance. The mark is now the most 
widely recognised social and development label in the world.86
</p>
<p>The FAIRTRADE mark is owned by FLO, but Fairtrade products are marketed 
by national labelling initiatives or marketing organisations working in twenty-
five countries.87 The national labelling initiatives may also license out the mark 
in their countries. The FLO is striving to streamline marketing operations of the 
national marketing initiatives while taking account of the cultural diversity of 
all its members and stakeholders.88
</p>
<p>Finally, the Fairtrade label system is financially sustainable.89 Comparatively, 
one of the reasons why the Australian system was deemed a failure was the lack 
of financial accountability.90
</p>
<p>(d) Preliminary Conclusion
</p>
<p>Fairtrade aims to help farmers in developing countries exclusively. The system, 
moreover, is designed for commodity products.91 Accordingly, it would not 
be possible to extend the current system to creative artefacts produced by 
indigenous peoples in developed countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the 
United States and Canada. First, such artefacts include tangible and intangible 
creations that in many ways are different from commodity products; and, 
secondly, indigenous peoples in these countries would be excluded from the 
system because of the development criterion.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are lessons that can be learned from the Fairtrade system. 
One important factor is certainly that Fairtrade did not begin from government 
or other top-down initiatives, but rather from the people in a grassroots manner. 
A second aspect is the institutional separation of the certification process from 
the other two functions of the system. Thirdly, in an environment of globalised 
markets, including markets for tangible and intangible artefacts of indigenous 
peoples, marketing strategies for an indigenous origin label must be developed 
at an international level. Finally, the success of such schemes depends largely on 
</p>
<p>86 At the end of 2008, there were 872 Fairtrade-certified producer organisations in 58 countries, representing 
over 1.5 million farmers and workers. FLO estimates that 7.5 million people directly benefit from Fairtrade. 
Over the last five years, sales of Fairtrade-certified products have grown almost 40% per year (on average) and, 
in 2008, Fairtrade-certified sales amounted to approximately &euro; 2.9 billion worldwide, FLO, Facts and Figures

<p>sufficient funding for proper marketing and consumer education. In the context 
of such a system for indigenous peoples, this may mean that strong state support 
may be required, at least initially.
</p>
<p>4. Compatibility with International Law
</p>
<p>In this section we will investigate how a voluntary standard certifying 
indigenous origin would relate to the in-progress WIPO legal instruments on 
TK/TCEs, and whether it would be in conformity with the TRIPS Agreement 
law and policy-making.
</p>
<p>(a) WIPO 
</p>
<p>In February 2012, WIPO&rsquo;s IGC met for its 20th session of debates regarding the 
development of new instruments of international law for the protection of TCE, 
TK and genetic resources. For the previous six years, divisive discussions in 
IGC meetings focused on the controversial 2005 draft provisions, prepared by 
the WIPO IGC Secretariat, for a sui generis protection of TK, TCEs and genetic 
resources.92 In 2007, the WIPO General Assembly renewed the IGC&rsquo;s mandate 
for two years, during which time there were three sessions but no consensus.93 
Despite this, in October 2009 the General Assembly of the WIPO decided to 
renew the IGC&rsquo;s mandate for a further two years.94 At the same time it was 
decided to start formal negotiations based on the draft proposals contained 
in the document on &lsquo;Revised Objectives and Principles&rsquo; for TCE: that is, the 
2005 draft provisions that had originally been prepared by the Secretariat.95 In 
October 2011, the mandate was again renewed for the 2012-2013 biennium.96

</p>
<p>In its 17th session, the IGC decided to use the results of the Intersessional Working 
Group on TCE (IWG 1) as the new textual basis for further negotiations.97 The 
IGC also established open-ended drafting groups to streamline the articles on 
TCEs and to identify any outstanding policy issues. The work of these groups 
resulted in the document &lsquo;The Protection of Traditional Cultural Expressions: 
Draft Articles&rsquo;,98 which was discussed in the IGC&rsquo;s 18th session, the outcome of 
which was deliberated over in the 19th session in July 2011.99 
</p>
<p>Since the start of the text-based negotiations in the 16th session of the IGC, 
drafting proposals made by member states have been continuously inserted into 
the working document, and updated versions have been produced after every 
session.100 The lack of certainty about the general acceptance of these suggested 
changes makes a substantive analysis of the draft treaty difficult. Furthermore, 
no decision has yet been taken on whether these negotiations should lead to a 
binding or non-binding instrument and, even if binding and adopted by the 
WIPO General Assembly, states can still decide on whether they wish to be 
signatories or not. Thus, the following discourse is made tentatively.
</p>
<p>The current document on TCE provides text that is relevant for certification 
trade marks. Article 3 of the draft provisions generally distinguishes the scope 
of and conditions for protection with regard to &lsquo;secret&rsquo; TCEs and &lsquo;other&rsquo; TCEs. 
Secret TCEs are protected against disclosure and any kind of use. With regard to 
other TCEs, there are three options. All three alternatives require that indigenous 
peoples be acknowledged as the source of the TCE, unless this is not possible 
because of the manner of use of the product. Under Alternative 1, it would be 
required that, with respect to TCEs which are words, signs, names and symbols, 
there be a collective right to authorise or prohibit the &lsquo;offering for sale or sale 
of articles that are falsely represented&rsquo; as TCEs of the beneficiaries, and any 
use that &lsquo;falsely suggests a connection with the beneficiaries&rsquo;.101 There is also 
</p>
<p>97 The IWG is an IGC-established expert group, within which every WIPO member state is represented by 
one person. It was decided by the IGC that three IWG meetings would take place. IWG 1 on TCE took place 
in July 2010, and IWG 2 and 3 on TK and Genetic Resources, respectively, took place in February and March 
2011. Although IWG is primarily an expert group, it can also draft text proposals for the amendment of the 
existing draft proposals for revised objectives and principles. The results of IWG 1 are contained in document 
WIPO IGC, Draft Articles on the Protection of Traditional Cultural Expressions/Expression of Folklore, Prepared 
at IWG 1, WIPO Doc WIPO/GRTKF/IC/17/9 (2010); IWG 2 in WIPO IGC, Draft Articles on the Protection of 
Traditional Knowledge, Prepared at IWG 2, WIPO Doc WIPO/GRTKF/IWG/2/3 (2011); and IWG 3 in WIPO

</p>
<p>a provision which allows indigenous peoples to object to any &lsquo;false, confusing 
or misleading indications&rsquo; on goods or services that suggest an endorsement 
by or linkage with them.102 Alternative 2 is the weakest option and does not 
mention protection from false misrepresentation. Finally, Alternative 3 states 
that adequate measures need to protect against the use of &lsquo;non-authentic&rsquo; TCEs 
in trade &lsquo;that suggests a connection that does not exist&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>The working document that was the basis for the negotiations until the 17th 
session of the IGC provided requirements to prevent misleading indications and 
false endorsement by, or linkage with, a traditional community that were very 
similar to Alternative 1 and consistent with Alternative 3 outlined above. In 
the IGC Secretariat&rsquo;s commentary on Article 3 of the earlier draft, it mentioned 
a &lsquo;handicraft sold as &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; or &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; when it is not&rsquo; as a practical 
example to illustrate the possible implementation of the provisions protecting 
against &lsquo;false or misleading indications in trade&rsquo;.103 According to the comment, 
the suggested principle could be put into practice at the national level through 
a number of measures, including &lsquo;the registration and use of certification 
trademarks&rsquo;.104 Although these comments are not part of the current working 
document, which is free of comments, they show that a system of voluntary 
certification for standards on ICH would, in principle, be in conformity with the 
current IGC draft provisions on TCE.
</p>
<p>(b) WTO Law: TRIPS, GATT, GATS, Subsidies and 
the TBT Agreement
</p>
<p>Together with the prohibition of discrimination, the elimination of tariff 
barriers and non-tariff barriers to market access of goods and services is a key 
instrument of trade liberalisation provided by the law of the WTO. In addition, 
the TRIPS Agreement specifically deals with the implications of IP systems on 
the conditions of competition in international trade.105
</p>
<p>(i) TRIPS Agreement
</p>
<p>For certification-mark types of protection for ICH, the TRIPS Agreement is 
relevant insofar as it incorporates in its section on &lsquo;Trademarks&rsquo; the relevant

105 It is the rationale of the TRIPS Agreement to balance the competing private interests of holders of 
IPRs and the public interest to assure the free flow of goods and services across borders. See T Cottier, &lsquo;The 
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights&rsquo; in PFJ Macrory et al (eds), The World

<p>provisions of the Paris Convention.106 Article 15.1 TRIPS Agreement provides 
for a very broad definition of trade marks which covers all types of signs, so 
long as they are distinctive.107 Although certification marks are not specifically 
mentioned, the TRIPS Agreement does not prevent this type of protection, 
since Article 1.1 explicitly authorises WTO members to &lsquo;implement in their law 
more extensive protection than is required by this Agreement&rsquo;. Article 16.1 
gives an exclusive right to a trade mark owner for the use of the trade mark 
&lsquo;in the course of trade&rsquo;. Non-commercial use is not protected. However, this is 
not a problem when the proposed certification system is intended for traded 
goods and services. Article 16.2 TRIPS Agreement provides protection of well-
known trade marks that goes beyond the Paris Convention. Whereas the Paris 
Convention limits the protection of well-known trade marks to trade marks 
used in respect of identical or similar goods, Article 16.2 TRIPS Agreement 
extends this protection mutatis mutandis to services, and Article 16.3 extends 
the protection of well-known marks to non-identical and non-similar goods and 
services.108 These provisions may be relevant if one would consider extending 
the FAIRTRADE label, which is certainly a famous mark, to services. Finally, 
Article 18 TRIPS Agreement provides that the registration of a trade mark shall 
be renewable indefinitely.
</p>
<p>(ii) GATT and GATS
</p>
<p>Since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and General 
Agreement of Trade in Services (GATS) obligations for market access and non-
discrimination apply between states, it is difficult to see how non-government 
voluntary certification standards would be affected by these rules. With regard 
to Fairtrade and similar schemes, government involvement has recently been 
discouraged in the European Union. In a 2009 communication, the European 
Commission concluded that government regulation in this field would hamper the 
dynamic element of private initiatives and &lsquo;could stand in the way of the further 
development of Fair Trade and other private schemes and their standards&rsquo;.109 If a 
government were to consider regulatory mechanisms relating to private labelling 
schemes, it would need to comply with existing WTO obligations, in particular 
</p>
<p>106 Provisions on trade marks are enshrined in Articles 15 to 21 under the heading &lsquo;Trademarks&rsquo; in Part 
II of the Agreement. Article 2.1 of the TRIPS Agreement provides that in respect of (inter alia) Part II of the 
agreement &lsquo;Members shall comply with Articles 1 through 12, and Article 19, of the Paris Convention (1967)&rsquo;.
107 According to Article 15.1 of the TRIPS Agreement, &lsquo;[a]ny sign, or any combination of signs, capable of 
distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings, shall be capable of 
constituting a trademark&rsquo;. See D Gervais, The TRIPS Agreement. Drafting History and Analysis (2nd ed, Sweet 
&amp; Maxwell, 2003) para 2.160.
108 This is considered to be an important contribution to raised standards of international trade mark 
protection. See C Correa, Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights: A Commentary on the TRIPS 
Agreement (Oxford University Press, 2007) 188.

<p>with the principles of non-discrimination, market access and transparency. 
There exists significant support for the view that a government-led voluntary 
labelling system would nevertheless be consistent with both the Most-Favoured-
Nation Treatment (MFN)110 and National Treatment111 obligations. There are also 
strong arguments that compliance with social standards, such as &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo;, 
could alone be sufficient to make products non-&lsquo;like&rsquo; and, thus, allowably

<p>Government support for a labelling system could be considered a subsidy. The 
law of the WTO provides rules on subsidies for goods but not for services.113 
Under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM 
Agreement), some subsidies are strictly forbidden if they are contingent on export 
performance or on the use of domestic over imported goods (Article 3.1), and 
others are actionable if they cause &lsquo;adverse effects&rsquo; on another member (Article 
5). According to Articles 1 and 2 of the SCM Agreement, a subsidy is defined 
</p>
<p>110 According to the 1991 GATT Panel Report, United States &mdash; Restrictions on Imports of Tuna I (Mexico) 
GATT Doc BISD 39S/155 (1991, unadopted) paras 5.42-5.43, this is so even if an &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; good and a &lsquo;non-
authentic&rsquo; good are considered &lsquo;like products&rsquo;. In that case, the panel decided that the US Dolphin Protection 
Consumer Information Act, according the right to use the label &lsquo;Dolphin Safe&rsquo; for tuna harvested in the 
Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean only if such tuna was accompanied by documentary evidence showing that 
it was not harvested with purse-seine nets intentionally deployed to encircle dolphins, was consistent with 
the MFN obligation (Article I GATT). In assessing MFN compliancy, the panel found that voluntary labelling 
for production or processing methods (PPMs), which do not affect the characteristics of the end product, are 
MFN compliant, as they do not restrict trade. Even though there was government involvement, a voluntary 
labelling system that ultimately affected the market only through the free choice of the consumer was stated 
not to be an &lsquo;advantage&rsquo; granted by the state. Although the report was not adopted, the panel&rsquo;s decision 
concerning voluntary single-issue labelling remains largely unchallenged. See C Dankers, Environmental and 
Social Standards, Certification and Labelling for Cash Crops, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations (UN FAO, 2003) 74, citing A E Appleton, Environmental Labelling Programmes: International Trade 
Law Implications (Kluwer Law International, 1997) 145.
111 The application of the National Treatment obligation to such voluntary labelling systems has never been 
assessed by a WTO Panel or the Appellate Body, whether state-supported or not. Even where there is state 
support for a voluntary labelling system, such a measure would not be a tax (Article III:2), a regulation or 
requirement (Article III:4) or any other measure mentioned in Article III:1 GATT. Furthermore, it is unlikely 
that the system would be perceived as &lsquo;affecting the internal sale offering for sale, purchase, transportation, 
distribution or use of products&rsquo; (Article III:4), due to the voluntary nature. See Dankers, ibid 74-75, citing 
Appleton, ibid 153.
112 In GATT Panel Report, United States &ndash; Restrictions on Imports of Tuna I (Mexico), above n 110, para 5.15, 
it was found that non-product-related (NPR) PPMs could not affect the &lsquo;likeness&rsquo; of end products. However, 
this has been questioned by P Van den Bossche, The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization (2nd 
ed, Cambridge University Press, 2008) 381, stating that a more &lsquo;nuanced&rsquo; approach is now required, as NPR-
PPMs can affect consumer tastes and preferences. Since this, in turn, affects the NPR-PPMs&rsquo; competitive and 
substitutive nature, the use of such measures would affect the likeness of an end product. However, Van den 
Bossche cautions that this would rarely occur, as most markets are driven by price rather than concern over 
conformity with social standards. 
113 Although Article XV GATS calls upon members to develop disciplines to avoid trade-distortive effects of 
subsidies, this is still a leftover. See P Sauv&eacute;, &lsquo;Completing the GATS Framework: Addressing Uruguay Round 
Leftovers&rsquo; (2002) 57(3) Aussenwirtschaft 301, 324&minus;333; P Poretti, &lsquo;Waiting for Godot: Subsidy Disciplines in 
Services Trade&rsquo; in M Panizzon et al (eds), GATS and the Regulation of International Trade in Services (Cambridge 
University Press, 2008) 466-488.</p>

</p>
<p>as: (1) a financial contribution by a public body; (2) that confers a benefit; (3) to 
a specific enterprise or industry. The concept of &lsquo;financial contribution&rsquo; is not 
limited to a direct transfer of funds, but includes reduction of costs, tax breaks114 
or other fiscal incentives to an industry.115 On the other hand, the requirement 
of a &lsquo;financial contribution&rsquo; means that not all government measures that confer 
a benefit are subsidies.116
</p>
<p>Even if state funded, a support scheme, such as the Australian Authenticity Label, 
would not constitute a &lsquo;subsidy&rsquo;, as it would not be a financial contribution, as 
required by Article 1.1 SCM Agreement, or take the form of income or price 
support in the sense of Article XVI GATT. The funding of a trade mark would 
neither reduce the costs of producers (for example, in production or in the 
export process) nor directly affect production. It would be neither contingent 
on export performance nor trade distorting (directly artificially increasing 
exports), and would not affect comparative advantage.117 Moreover, Article 14(d) 
of the SCM Agreement states that the provision of governmental services is not 
to be considered as conferring a benefit, if the service is provided for adequate 
remuneration. Thus, a financially self-sustaining certification system (such as 
the Fairtrade system, through membership fees and other income)118 would be 
compliant with the SCM Agreement. Even if fulfilling the other requirements 
of a &lsquo;subsidy&rsquo;, the funding of a trade mark for authentic indigenous cultural 
products would be considered general and not specific, as it would apply to 
more than one enterprise, industry or region,119 and would not be dependent 
thereon.
</p>
<p>(iv) TBT Agreement 
</p>
<p>With regard to technical regulations and standards for the trade in goods, 
the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) must be respected to 
ensure that they do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade.120 
</p>
<p>114 Whereas tax breaks discriminating between foreign and domestic goods would violate Article III(2) 
GATT, it seems likely that WTO Panels or the AB would consider a non-discriminatory tax cut a financial 
contribution within the meaning of Article 1.1 SCM. See C B Graber, &lsquo;State Aid for Digital Games and Cultural 
Diversity: A Critical Reflection in the Light of EU and WTO Law&rsquo; in C B Graber and M Burri-Nenova (eds),

</p>
<p>The TBT Agreement covers packaging, marking and labelling requirements, 
and procedures for assessing conformity with the technical regulations 
and standards.121 Since &lsquo;regulations&rsquo; are mandatory for the purposes of the 
Agreement, a voluntary labelling system would be a &lsquo;standard&rsquo; rather than a 
&lsquo;regulation&rsquo;. Under the TBT Agreement, the requirements for voluntary systems 
are less stringent than those for mandatory systems.122 &lsquo;Standard&rsquo; is defined as:
</p>
<p>Document approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common 
and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products or 
related processes and production methods, with which compliance is not 
mandatory. It may also include or deal exclusively with terminology, 
symbols, packaging, marking or labelling requirements as they apply to a 
product, process or production method.123
</p>
<p>Although &lsquo;recognized body&rsquo; is not defined in the TBT Agreement, it is not limited 
to governments or public authorities, but may also include non-governmental 
standardising bodies.124 A &lsquo;non-governmental body&rsquo; is a body other than a central 
government or local government body,125 and includes &lsquo;a non-governmental body 
which has legal power to enforce a technical regulation&rsquo;.126 Private organisations 
managing the proposed label would fall into this definition.
</p>
<p>It is evident that the TBT Agreement applies to processes and production methods 
(PPMs). However, there remain several open questions with regard to whether 
an authenticity standard for product differentiation would be covered by the 
TBT Agreement. To begin with, it is not clear whether such a standard would be 
product related.127 Assuming that such a standard is non-product related (NPR), 
</p>
<p>121 Preamble of the TBT Agreement.
122 Interestingly, countries often argue against the differentiation between mandatory and voluntary 
standards, saying that, because the standard creates market segregation, compliance with the standard becomes 
de facto mandatory. See Dankers, above n 110, 76, citing a submission made in 2001 by Switzerland to the WTO 
Committee on Trade and Environment, &lsquo;Marking and Labelling Requirements&rsquo;, WTO Docs WT/CTE/W/192 and 
G/TBT/W/162 (2001). See also Kommerskollegium National Board of Trade, Global Trade Division, Sweden, 
&lsquo;Eco-Labelling and the WTO: Issues for Further Analysis and Clarification&rsquo;, (Report No. 119-007-2002, 2002) 
5. However, this would not be the case with the proposed standard and labelling system, as it would not be 
possible for everyone to apply for the certification, thus it is not possible for it to be de facto mandatory.
123 TBT Agreement, annex 1, para. 2 [emphasis added].
124 Van den Bossche, above n 112, 813-814.
125 &lsquo;Central government body&rsquo; and &lsquo;local government body&rsquo; are defined in TBT Agreement annex 1, paras 
6 and 7 respectively.
126 Ibid, annex 1, para 8.
127 It is also not clear whether authentic and non-authentic products would be like. In addition, the 
concept of &lsquo;likeness&rsquo; has not yet been clarified under the TBT Agreement (but is relevant for the assessment of 
conformity with the MFN and National treatment principles within the TBT Agreement and the annexed Code 
of Good Practice). Whereas &lsquo;likeness&rsquo; has been expounded upon by Panels and the Appellate Body in the realm 
of Articles I and III GATT, it must be recalled that the concept of &lsquo;like products&rsquo; may have a different meaning 
in the different contexts it is used. According to Van den Bossche, above n 112, 818, structural differences 
between the GATT and the TBT Agreement stand in the way of applying this GATT-related case law to the 
TBT Agreement. Whereas the assessment of &lsquo;likeness&rsquo; in general depends greatly on the consumer perception 
of the goods at issue, &lsquo;likeness&rsquo; and &lsquo;product-relatedness&rsquo;, under the TBT Agreement, are much more technical </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>116
</p>
<p>it is furthermore uncertain whether the TBT Agreement would be applicable at 
all,128 since there has been a lot debate regarding the interpretation of the concept 
of &lsquo;standard&rsquo; as defined in Annex 1 to the TBT Agreement. The first sentence 
of the definition of &lsquo;standard&rsquo; (as outlined above) specifically mentions product-
related PPMs, but the second sentence (which deals with marking or labelling 
requirements) leaves the word &lsquo;related&rsquo; out.129 Apparently, the negotiators failed 
to agree on whether NPR-PPMs for terminology, symbols, packaging, marking 
or labelling requirements would be covered by this definition. Whereas Van den 
Bossche130 favours a text-based interpretation that would include NPR-PPMs, 
other authors have argued for a contrary view.131
</p>
<p>To be sure, even if the standard of authenticity were covered by the TBT 
Agreement, its reach would be limited, because &mdash; like in all other WTO law 
&mdash; only government actions are regulated. Article 4.1 of the TBT Agreement 
requires full compliance only from central governmental bodies, and members 
need only to take &lsquo;reasonable measures&rsquo; as may be available to them to ensure 
non-governmental bodies&rsquo; and local governmental bodies&rsquo;132 compliance with 
the &lsquo;Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of 
Standards&rsquo;.133 There is no WTO case law explaining what &lsquo;reasonable measures&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>in nature. It has also been argued that the fact that the TBT Agreement offers no explicit exceptions to MFN 
and National Treatment (unlike in GATT), &lsquo;like&rsquo; may be read more narrowly, otherwise members would be 
left little room to distinguish products for environmental, health or social reasons, as allowed by Article XX 
GATT. N Bernasconi-Osterwalder et al, Environment and Trade: A Guide to WTO Jurisprudence (Earthscan, 
2006) 16, 215. 
128 No WTO Panel or Appellate Body has yet looked at the applicability of the TBT Agreement to voluntary 
standards that are NPR-PPMs. Bernasconi-Osterwalder, above n 127, 207. The TBT Committee discusses the 
applicability of the TBT Agreement to NPR-PPMs (J. Stein, &lsquo;The Legal Status of Eco-Labels and Product and 
Process Methods in the World Trade Organization&rsquo; (2009) 1(4) American Journal of Economics and Business 
Administration 285, 287). The Committee on Trade and Environment has also been tasked with considering the 
relationship between WTO provisions and environmental standards, due to the recent trend of eco-labelling:

light of the first, as the second sentence was never meant to be a stand-alone provision, and that NPR-PPMs 
arguably were not intended to be covered by the TBT Agreement, which is indicated by the negotiation 
history. These arguments appear to give much weight to the negotiation history. However, according to the 
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), &lsquo;preparatory work&rsquo; should only be a supplementary means 
of interpretation in the sense of Article 32 VCLT.

regardless of whether central or local. See M Koebele and G LaFortune, &lsquo;Agreement on Technical Barriers to 
Trade. Article 4 and Annex 3 TBT&rsquo; (2007) in R Wolfrum et al (eds), above n 120, 243, 255-256.

<p>means in the TBT context.134 In any case, these are only &lsquo;best effort&rsquo; or &lsquo;second-
level&rsquo; obligations of members.135 Moreover, there is nothing to suggest that the 
proposed system would be contrary to the Code.136
</p>
<p>In conclusion, whereas the TRIPS Agreement provides for positive protection 
for certification trade marks, there is no evidence suggesting that voluntary 
certification standards &mdash; even if government supported &mdash; would not be 
consistent with the GATT, the GATS, or the TBT and the SCM Agreements.
</p>
<p>5. Conclusion
</p>
<p>The burgeoning market for indigenous goods and services has resulted in a 
parallel increase in the production of non-authentic products of this nature. 
In recognition of this, many label schemes have been initiated in an attempt 
to validate authenticity, and educate and sway consumers away from non-
authentic products. However, none of these has achieved success comparable 
with the Fairtrade label. Indeed the Australian certification label system was 
shut down after only two years of operations, and the New Zealand Māori-made 
(toi iho) system was disinvested by the government in late 2009.
</p>
<p>The four main structural reasons for the failure of the Australian system were: (1) 
the &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; nature of the system and the poor consultation with the relevant 
stakeholders prior to its inception; (2) difficulties in defining the standard of 
&lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; and then controlling what fell into this; (3) non-independence 
of the certifier, which was the same body that set the standards and owned 
the trade marks; and (4) poor funding of the system, which meant an inability 
to market the initiative adequately in Australia, let alone internationally. 
Conversely, the FLO Fairtrade scheme started as a &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; initiative and 
continues to integrate stakeholder involvement into every aspect of its decision-
making processes, including the setting of standards. Moreover, certification 
is not performed by the FLO, but by FLO-CERT. Though owned by FLO, FLO-
</p>
<p>134 Bernasconi-Osterwalder et al, above n 127, 207. The term &lsquo;reasonable measures&rsquo; was derived from 
Article XXIV:12 GATT, which requires that a member &lsquo;shall take such reasonable measures as may be available 
to it to ensure observance of the provisions of this Agreement by the regional and local governments and 
authorities within its territories.&rsquo; It is limited in scope to situations where the central government body is in 
the position to direct or influence compliance, e.g. if there are legal means available for this. Political resistance 
or sensitivity would not be sufficient to deter the obligation, but requiring a change in law (particularly 
constitutional law) would likely not be reasonable. See ibid, 225-257.

8 TBT&rsquo; (2007) in R Wolfrum et al, above n 120, 298, 300.
136 The Code of Good Practice includes requirements of MFN and National Treatment and promotes 
international harmonisation and the avoidance of duplication of the work of other standardising bodies. 
Standards should not restrict trade unnecessarily and should be published 60 days before adoption to allow 
interested parties to submit comments. These are outlined and discussed in Koebele and LaFortune, above n 
132, 247-253.</p>

<p>CERT is a completely autonomous and independent organisation. FLO-CERT 
is also ISO 65 certified, which ensures (a) a quality management system; (b) 
transparency; and (c) independence in decision-making. Finally, Fairtrade is 
financially self-sufficient and well marketed around the world.
</p>
<p>In Australia, there is some movement towards using a fair trade scheme and a 
voluntary labelling system for indigenous TK/TCEs.137
</p>
<p>It is not perceived that a voluntary certification system for TK/TCEs would be 
contrary to either WIPO or WTO law or policy. Such a system is in conformity 
with the current line of thought in the WIPO forum. Regarding WTO law, a 
voluntary certification system appears to be consistent with the GATT and the 
SCM Agreement. The most relevant agreement is likely to be the TBT Agreement. 
TBT compliance of a voluntary scheme has never been assessed by any WTO 
dispute body and it is thus not clear whether it would fall into the Agreement&rsquo;s 
scope. Much of this would depend on whether the standard of authenticity 
was deemed to be &lsquo;product related&rsquo; and capable of making authentic and non-
authentic products non-&lsquo;like&rsquo;. Compliance would also depend on whether the 
system is supported by central government or not. In any case, the voluntary 
system would not be contrary to any of the principles of the TBT Agreement 
(including MFN and National Treatment) or the Code of Good Practice. 
</p>
<p>The extension of the FLO Fairtrade system to TK/TCEs would be problematic. 
One of the options that Australia is looking at is co-branding through a joint 
Fairtrade label.138 Currently, not all producers qualify to apply for the Fairtrade 
label.139 Moreover, the products for which the mark can be used are also limited 
and include only commodity products.140 The FLO has indicated its plan to 
widen the range of people able to benefit from the system, including adding 
more countries and more products.141 Indeed, the FLO recently added the first 
service to its mandate, now certifying travel tours.142 However, the FLO has 
admitted that introducing new products is slow and costly because of the great 
deal of research that is involved in assessing whether the introduction will 
really benefit the producers.143 It is difficult to create standards (particularly 
those that can be consistently certified) for handicrafts and other products 
(and services) made by small-scale producers, each of which may be unique

</p>
<p>and involve varying production processes and costs.144 Consequently, it could 
be argued that the Fairtrade system is more suited for TK- rather than TCE-
related products. However, given the large variety of agricultural goods among 
indigenous communities, the creation of standards could prove complicated 
even for these goods. Moreover, considering the difficulties in getting different 
Australian Aborigines to identify with an Australian labelling system, it may be 
equally (if not more) problematic to convince many different indigenous peoples 
from around the world to stand behind a pan-global label which is to some 
extent meant to reflect identity.145 The vast differences between indigenous 
communities would make the creation of the standards logistically difficult. 
Finally, it is worth noting that the democratic structure required under the 
FLO general standards could contradict the customs of certain indigenous 
communities.
</p>
<p>Although the idea of employing the FLO scheme for indigenous purposes is 
tempting, a great deal of research would be needed to make this work. An 
avenue to explore could be the formulation of only one set of FLO standards for 
all indigenous products or services, aside from those otherwise certified by the 
FLO. These standards would have to be quite broad and general, and capable 
of covering a wide range of products or services. A difficult question to resolve 
would be what exactly it is they should address. Moreover, we suggest studying 
the possibilities of interfacing &lsquo;Fairtrade philosophy&rsquo; with existing marketing 
structures successfully operated by indigenous people at the local level, such as 
the Aboriginal cultural centres that exist in Australia. These centres could be of 
help in the most difficult task of developing a standard of &lsquo;Aboriginal origin&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;Aboriginal authenticity&rsquo; that would be accepted by indigenous people (locally) 
while, at the same time, complying with broader FLO standards (globally).

<p>1. Introduction
</p>
<p>Michel Foucault commented that the modern concept of author &lsquo;constitutes 
a privileged moment of individualism in the history of ideas&rsquo;.1 Indeed, the 
authors who pushed for the adoption of international copyright rules were 
basking in the sun of the Enlightenment, stroked by the rays of individualism.2 
The underlying Hegelian framework &mdash; a transfer of the author&rsquo;s personality in 
literary (or artistic) expression &mdash; led to an insistence on the right of attribution, 
a component of the moral right enshrined in the Berne Convention.3
</p>
<p>For inventions, a similar insistence on individual self-actualisation and 
responsibility for scientific advances is evident. Isn&rsquo;t the history of science 
taught in schools around the world centred on individual inventors? Foucault 
again: 
</p>
<p>The history of knowledge has tried for a long time to obey [&hellip;] the claim 
of attribution: each discovery should not only be situated and dated, 
but should also be attributed to someone; it should have an inventor and 
someone responsible for it. General or collective phenomena on the other 
hand, those which cannot be &lsquo;attributed&rsquo;, are normally devalued: they

et Artistique Internationale (ALAI), an international organisation of authors, had submitted a draft which the 
Swiss government modified and submitted as a draft treaty. ALAI continued to take part (as what in modern 
parlance would be called a non-governmental organisation) in the discussions, however. ALAI was founded in 
1878 by French playwright and public intellectual Victor Hugo, its first President. ALAI Congresses were held 
(during the relevant period) in 1879 (London); 1880 (Lisbon); 1881 (Vienna); 1882 (Rome); 1883 (Amsterdam) 
and 1884 (Brussels). See Actes Du Congres De Dresde (1895) 11.

</p>
<p>are still traditionally described through words like tradition, mentality, 
modes; and one lets them play the negative role of a brake in relation to 
&lsquo;originality&rsquo; of the inventor.4
</p>
<p>While plagium has been frowned upon for centuries, and invention has been 
around for at least as long (the Babylonians, Aristotle, and so on), individual 
invention and authorship of well-identified works and inventions &mdash; and 
certainly monetary rewards &mdash; emerge as normative precursors and bulwarks 
of &lsquo;Western&rsquo; intellectual property rights.5 The Berne Convention refers several 
times to the author (for example, to the &lsquo;life of the author&rsquo;, which serves as a basis 
to calculate the term of protection). Similarly, the Paris Convention &mdash; though, 
unlike its Berne cousin, it was written not by authors or inventors but by patent 
and trade mark office administrators &mdash; is infused with the personality of the 
inventor and steeped in the nineteenth-century Western European zeitgeist.6 
By contrast, many indigenous artists were seen as creating only as part of a 
collective. As Dan Monroe, Executive Director of the Peabody Essex Museum in 
Salem, Massachusetts, noted, &lsquo;recognizing that Native American art was made 
by individuals, not tribes, and labelling it accordingly, is a practice that is long 
overdue&rsquo;.7
</p>
<p>There are a few possible exceptions that come to mind, of course, but are they 
real exceptions in the sense of an abandonment of the premise of individuality? 
Not really. Most countries recognise collective works in copyright, for example, 
but then create the fiction that the &lsquo;arranger&rsquo; is the author because of the 
originality she transferred to the collective work.8

<p>6 . Traditional Innovation and the Ongoing Debate on the Protection of Geographical Indications
</p>
<p>123
</p>
<p>Yet there is one area of intellectual property which bucks this philosophic-
cultural trend: the protection of geographical indications (GIs). In fact, it is 
not entirely clear whether this area is &lsquo;intellectual property&rsquo;.9 Its underlying 
premise is different: it holds that a combination of natural and human (but not 
individual) factors anchored in (usually longstanding) tradition can give certain 
products special characteristics. These unique admixtures &mdash; sometimes referred 
to as terroir &mdash; are both commercial instruments and symbols of national or 
regional identity.10
</p>
<p>A system of protection for denominations of origin uses that combination as a 
marketing tool to extract additional rent in various commercial offerings, but 
also to affirm the special nature of the place it designates as the origin of a GI 
product. Put differently, the consumer is asked to pay more (or less) because the 
GI validates not just the factual claim that a white wine made with Sauvignon 
grapes will not be the same &mdash; even if made by the same person using the same 
technique &mdash; in the Loire valley of France and the Marlborough region of New 
Zealand, but that its origin reflects both a know-how and natural conditions 
that make that wine &lsquo;special&rsquo;.11 Wine experts agree that the acidity of the soil, 
and the amount of rain and sun exposure will affect the outcome, but the GI 
does even more: it recognises a collective right of producers in a given region 
to claim and capture the (real or perceived) special quality or characteristic of 
the product. 
</p>
<p>A legal mechanism, namely the 1958 Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of 
Appellations of Origin and their International Registration, was designed to 
capture that special value and protect it against usurpation or imitation.12 As 
such, it could mesh well with forms of traditional innovation and both old and 
new forms of economic exploitation of traditional knowledge related to crafts 
or food. It could conceivably extend to other forms of innovation (for example, 
</p>
<p>9 Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization, (1967) 848 UNTS 3, art 2 defines 
intellectual property as follows: &lsquo;&ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; shall include the rights relating to: literary, artistic 
and scientific works, performances of performing artists, phonograms, and broadcasts, inventions in all fields 
of human endeavor, scientific discoveries, industrial designs, trademarks, service marks, and commercial 
names and designations, protection against unfair competition, and all other rights resulting from intellectual 
activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic fields&rsquo;. The only possible pigeonhole for GIs would be 
as commercial designations or perhaps a general form of unfair competition regulation.
10 &lsquo;The notion that food is both sacred and site-specific is the root of the emotionally charged French 
concept of &ldquo;terroir.&rdquo; First applied to describe the association of grape variety and soil in winemaking, it has 
come to evoke the wholesome, earthy qualities of regional foods and cooking.&rsquo;, D Downie, &lsquo;Let Them Eat Big 
Macs&rsquo;, Salon (online), 7 July 2000, &lt;http://www.salon.com/business/feature/2000/07/06/frenchfood/index.

of the soil to retain heat, thus encouraging ripening and the development of stronger roots. See D Bird,

<p>traditional medicinal products) if one of the perceived characteristics of the 
product was anchored in a specific region because the land has a special quality, 
because the inhabitants have a special way of exploiting it, or both.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, I proceed as follows. I discuss, first, the Lisbon Agreement 
and then the more recent Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) in the WTO context. This rather technical 
analysis is then broadened to consider how GIs mesh normatively with the 
protection of traditional innovation.13 Finally, I suggest possible changes to 
the Lisbon Agreement, some of which are under consideration at the World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), as of the time of writing, that would 
allow some forms of traditional innovation to benefit from a reform of the 
international protection of GIs.
</p>
<p>2. The Lisbon Agreement
</p>
<p>To understand the Lisbon Agreement, let us consider briefly its current 
membership and current use; whether what it protects &mdash; namely &lsquo;appellations 
of origin&rsquo; &mdash; are different from the &lsquo;geographical indications&rsquo; protected under 
the TRIPS Agreement; and then the way in which it operates both substantively 
(scope of protection) and administratively (as a register of geographical 
denominations).
</p>
<p>(a) Membership and Current Use
</p>
<p>There were only twenty-seven countries party to the Lisbon Agreement as of 
June 2012.14 As such, it cannot be said to have established a worldwide system 
of protection for geographical denominations used in association with specific 
products. That said, there has been progress in recent years: approximately 
one-third of the Lisbon member states joined after the conclusion of the TRIPS 
Agreement in 1994.15 In spite of those additions, however, the Agreement&rsquo;s 
membership is still largely concentrated in the Mediterranean world. An

separate from trade mark law) exist in approximately 75 countries. See I Kireeva and B O&rsquo;Connor, &lsquo;Geographical

</p>
<p>examination of all current appellations on the register shows that almost all 
emanate from fewer than ten countries. Indeed, eleven countries hold 97.5 per 
cent of all entries, and in fact the top three hold over 78 per cent, with one 
country, France, holding 62.5 per cent of the total (almost 90 per cent of which 
are for wines and spirits).16 In terms of product areas, of the 813 accessible 
entries on the register,17 588 (72.3 per cent) were for wines and spirits (519 
for wines, and thus potentially of interest for the Article 23.4 register) and an 
additional 11 for beer.18
</p>
<p>(b) Appellations of Origin v Geographical Indications
</p>
<p>One feature of the Lisbon system is that it applies to &lsquo;appellations of origin&rsquo;. By 
contrast, the TRIPS Agreement uses the expression &lsquo;geographical indications&rsquo;. 
Is there a difference? This will matter when deciding where to house a new GIs 
system. The Lisbon Agreement defines &lsquo;appellations of origin&rsquo; as follows:
</p>
<p>[...] the geographical name of a country, region, or locality, which serves 
to designate a product originating therein, the quality or characteristics 
of which are due exclusively or essentially to the geographical environment, 
including  natural and human factors.19
</p>
<p>Appellations of origin are denominations that designate a geographical location 
to distinguish products produced in that location, and produced either 
according to regulations or &lsquo;local, constant and trusted usage&rsquo;20 in such location, 
which results in a certain quality or characteristics of the product and in the 
acquisition of a reputation.
</p>
<p>The notion of &lsquo;geographical indication&rsquo; used in TRIPS also focuses on the quality 
or characteristics of goods that derive from a geographical origin.21 However, 
TRIPS adds a measure of semiotic flexibility by encompassing any indication 
(denomination or otherwise) that would point to a particular geographic origin 
as long as a certain quality or characteristic (and/or reputation) is attributable 
to that origin. That difference seems theoretical today, because the current 
practice under the Lisbon Agreement is to register denominations that may not 
be &lsquo;denominations&rsquo; stricto sensu.22

</p>

</p>
<p>Another difference is in the treatment of reputation. The Lisbon Agreement 
defines &lsquo;country of origin&rsquo; as &lsquo;the country whose name, or the country in which 
is situated the region or locality whose name, constitutes the appellation of 
origin which has given the product its reputation.&rsquo;23 Lisbon focuses on quality 
and characteristics that provide a reputational advantage (the land, its particular 
use or, more typically, both), while TRIPS lists the three notions as separate 
phenomena that may emerge from the link to a specific geographic origin. It 
is essential to bear in mind that reputation is only a mental link between that 
product and a perceived quality or characteristic tied to a geographical origin. 
Put differently, if potential buyers of a product want it because a quality or 
characteristic associated with it stems from its geographical origin (whether the 
cause is human or natural factors, or a combination of both), then that product 
may be said to have a given reputation.24
</p>
<p>(c) Scope of Protection
</p>
<p>If TRIPS and Lisbon apply to essentially the same subject matter, is the scope of 
protection in the two instruments comparable? Article 3 of the Lisbon Agreement 
provides that protection must be conferred against usurpation or imitation, even 
if the true origin of the product is indicated or the appellation is accompanied 
by terms such as &lsquo;kind&rsquo;, &lsquo;type&rsquo;, &lsquo;make&rsquo;, &lsquo;imitation&rsquo; or the like.25 The Actes define 
usurpation as the &lsquo;illicit adoption&rsquo; of an appellation (and provide counterfeiting 
as a possible synonym) and, as to the latter, refer to &lsquo;fraudulent imitation&rsquo;.26 
This seems reasonably limited in scope. The Actes also make it clear that it is 
up to each country to decide what remedies should be available.27 There is thus 
sufficient implementation flexibility to accommodate different legal systems. I 
will suggest below that a protocol to the Agreement should be added to the 
current framework. One of its key purposes would be to align the Lisbon 
terminology and prohibitions with the TRIPS language to avoid the inherent 
risks associated with a dual standard of protection.
</p>
<p>Determining the scope of protection also means determining how conflicts with 
prior trade marks might be handled. The Lisbon Agreement allows, but does 
not obligate, its members to adopt or continue to use: (1) the &lsquo;first in time, 
first in right&rsquo; approach, as promoted, inter alia, by the International Trademark 
Association (INTA)28 and the International Association for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>23 Article 2(2) provides that the &lsquo;country of origin is the country whose name, or the country in which is 
situated the region or locality whose name, constitutes the appellation of origin which has given the product 
its reputation&rsquo; [emphasis added].

<p>Intellectual Property (AIPPI);29 (2) a co-existence approach (that is, a GI and 
trade mark with similar legal effect);30 or (3) a GI superiority approach. Members 
may do so with or without a good faith requirement concerning the prior trade 
mark.31 Some members actually use more than one approach. GIs have superior 
rights over prior trade marks in EC Regulation 1493/1999,32 which provides 
for discontinuation of the use of a prior trade mark if a confusingly similar 
designation is later on protected as a GI for wine; but EC Regulation 2081/9233 
and amended Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2392/89 provide for co-existence 
under certain conditions between a prior trade mark and a later GI (but not vice 
versa); and Article 3(4) of Regulation 510/200634 provides that a &lsquo;designation 
of origin or geographical indication shall not be registered where, in the light 
of a trademark&rsquo;s reputation and renown and the length of time it has been 
used, registration is liable to mislead the consumer as to the true identity of the 
product&rsquo;. The United States and most if not all countries that protect GIs under 
trade mark law prefer, and would likely insist on, the &lsquo;first in time, first in right&rsquo; 
approach.35 As noted below, a refusal under Lisbon can be partially withdrawn 
to allow co-existence with a prior trade mark for an indefinite period or to allow 
co-existence of homonymous denominations.

intellectuelle.
30 This can also be the case between two appellations. By using a declaration of partial refusal, a country 
may allow an appellation but preserve the right of another country to use that same appellation, as was done 
for Pisco. Mexico, for instance, refused Pisco but only to the extent that the registration by Peru &lsquo;constitutes 
an obstacle to products from Chile bearing the denomination of origin Pisco&rsquo;. Mexico&rsquo;s withdrawal of refusal 
is dated 24 October 2006 [author&rsquo;s translation].

<p>(d) Registration
Applications for registration on the Lisbon register may be made only by or through 
the appointed authority of a member state.36 The national authority applies in the 
&lsquo;name of any natural persons or legal entities, public or private, having, according 
to their national legislation, a right to use such appellations&rsquo;.37 Two conclusions can 
already be drawn: (a) a national authority must be appointed to interface with the 
Lisbon register; and (b) it is up to each country of origin to decide who has the right 
to register a Lisbon appellation.38
</p>
<p>Are Lisbon members obligated to accept any appellation registered by another 
member? The dispute resolution component of the system is simple: any national 
office may declare that it &lsquo;cannot ensure the protection of an appellation of origin 
whose registration has been notified to it ... together with an indication of the 
grounds therefore&rsquo;.39 This declaration of refusal must be made within one year of the 
receipt of WIPO&rsquo;s notification and may not be made later.40 If a declaration of refusal 
is made within the appropriate timeframe and with justification, WIPO then notifies 
the country of origin which, in turn, notifies the applicant. The only remedy available 
at that juncture for the applicant/right holder is to resort, in the refusing country, to 
the judicial and administrative remedies open to the nationals of that country. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, there are no limits imposed on the grounds that may be invoked in support 
of a declaration of refusal under Article 5(3). The negotiating history provides one 
example: when a member considers that an appellation has become generic in its 
territory.41 There are several other grounds for a refusal, however.42 The Actes show 
</p>
<p>36 Lisbon Agreement, above n 12, art 5. The official French text speaks of &lsquo;administration comp&eacute;tente&rsquo;. See 
M Geuze, Let&rsquo;s Have Another Look at the Lisbon Agreement: &ndash; Its Terms in Their Context and in the Light of Its 
Object and Purpose WIPO Doc WIPO/GEO/BEI/07/10 (2007).
37 Lisbon Agreement, above n 12, art 5(1). The obligation to apply through a national authority is similar under 
the Madrid system (trade marks). See Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Trademarks, 
828 UNTS 389 (1891) and the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of 
Marks (1989) 28 Industrial Property Law and Treaties 3-007, 001. One potential difference is whether the national 
authority is required to pass on an application to the international level (WIPO) or whether it could refuse to do so if 
it considered the application unfounded. The latter is certainly permissible under Lisbon. 
38 Regulations under the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and Their International 
Registration, above n 12, art 4 provides that each country must inform WIPO of the name and address of the 
authority competent to effect each of the notifications possible under the Agreement.
39 Ibid, art 5(3).
40 Ibid, art 5(4).
41 In a document prepared for the recently established Working Group on the Development of the Lisbon System, 
the WIPO Secretariat notes: &lsquo;[A] contracting country may refuse to protect an appellation of origin because it 
considers that the appellation has already acquired a generic character in its territory in relation to the product 
to which it refers or because it considers that the geographical designation does not conform to the definition of 
an appellation of origin in the Lisbon Agreement or because the appellation would conflict with a trademark or 
other right already protected in the country concerned.&rsquo; WIPO Doc, Possible Improvements Of The Procedures Under 
The Lisbon Agreement, WIPO Doc LI/WG/DEV/1/2 (2009), annex II, 4 [emphasis added] &lt;http://www.wipo.int/

</p>
<p>that Italy suggested an amendment to limit refusals only to cases where an appellation 
has become generic in the declaring country, and this amendment was refused by a 
vote of 7&ndash;1.43 Other possible grounds for refusal include cases where an appellation 
is used for a product that violates ordre public,44 and cases where what was registered 
is not considered a proper appellation.45  The Actes make that clear: &lsquo;The proposed 
procedure gives countries which receive the notification of an appellation of origin 
from the International Bureau the possibility of using any legal or factual situation to 
oppose the grant of protection for all or part of the territory of the Special Union.&rsquo;46
</p>
<p>As a possible alternative to a refusal, Article 5(6) of Lisbon provides that if an 
appellation which has been granted protection in a given country pursuant to 
notification of its international registration was already in use by third parties 
in that country &mdash; and assuming that no refusal is notified under Article 5(3) 
&mdash; such third parties may be given a delay of up to two years to cease using the 
appellation.47 A notification to WIPO is required. 
</p>
<p>The twelve-month period to notify a refusal is not quite the last word. Under 
Lisbon Rule 16, a Lisbon member may invalidate a registered appellation. Once 
the invalidation is final (usually after all rights to appeal have been used or 
expired), it must be notified to the International Bureau.48 A court or other 
competent authority in the country where protection is claimed can invalidate 
an appellation for any reason. 
</p>
<p>The fundamental underpinning of the Article 5 registration system is thus 
that the system, and especially the decision to file a declaration of refusal, 
is administered by each member state. The negotiating history makes plain 
that the negotiators did not want an international supervisory or oversight 
authority.49 A Lisbon member can refuse any appellation notified to it. If and 
when approached by the country of origin, it may negotiate the withdrawal of 
such refusals50 in the same way that bilateral agreements are now negotiated to 
protect certain GIs.51 The Actes are similarly clear in that respect: &lsquo;The refusal

45 The appellation &lsquo;Bud&rsquo; (Appellation 598) was similarly refused by many Lisbon members as not referring 
to a geographical location. The case also highlights the differences between appellations and trade marks.

</p>
<p>must be accompanied by the grounds for which the country has decided not to 
grant protection. Those grounds constitute a basis for possible discussion with 
a view to arriving at an agreement.&rsquo;52
</p>
<p>There is, however, one substantive limit to refusals: Article 6 of the Lisbon 
Agreement provides that a registered appellation cannot be deemed to have 
become generic as long as it remains protected in the country of origin.53 The 
expression &lsquo;deemed to have become&rsquo; plainly refers to an evolution in time. Put 
differently, genericness is not an event; it is a process. As noted in a WIPO 
document, Article 6 is not as harsh as it sounds: &lsquo;Exceptions to this general rule 
may apply, in particular in cases of acquiescence, i.e. if the exclusive right to use 
the appellation of origin has not been enforced vis-&agrave;-vis certain persons, who 
are using the appellation of origin in respect of products that do not meet the 
specific geographically-determined qualifications linked to the appellation of 
origin.&rsquo;54 This seems to imply that a Lisbon member may, in bilateral discussions, 
recognise the generic nature of one of its appellations in another member&rsquo;s 
territory. 
</p>
<p>3. The TRIPS Agreement
</p>
<p>There are two main areas where differences between TRIPS and Lisbon appear 
&mdash; apart from the difference between the notions of geographical indication 
and of appellation of origin, discussed in the previous section. The first is the 
dual level of protection in TRIPS, and its special treatment of wines and spirits. 
The other is the presence of a number of conflict rules that go well beyond the 
possibility of a refusal in Lisbon. I will consider each one in turn.
</p>
<p>(a) Two Levels of Protection
</p>
<p>The TRIPS Agreement provides for two types of protection of GIs. Article 22.2 
obliges WTO members to provide Paris-type protection for GIs. That level of 
protection is described here as &lsquo;legal means&rsquo; for interested parties to prevent (a) 
the use of any means (not limited to a name)55 in the designation or presentation 
of a good that could mislead the public into believing that the good in question 
originated in a geographical area other than the true place of origin; or (b) any 
</p>
<p>Journal of International Law 731.
52 Actes, above n 20, 817 [author&rsquo;s translation]. A number of proposed amendments to the Rules would 
streamline the system. See WIPO Doc, Report adopted by Assembly, LI Doc LI/A/25/1 (2009), annex 1.
53 Lisbon Agreement, above n 12, art 6.
54 Geuze, above n 36, 8.
55 It would seem that the reference to &lsquo;any means in the designation or presentation&rsquo;, combined with the 
open-ended mention of &lsquo;indication which identify a good&rsquo; (regardless of the means), covers also indirect 
indications.</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>6 . Traditional Innovation and the Ongoing Debate on the Protection of Geographical Indications
</p>
<p>131
</p>
<p>use which constitutes an act of unfair competition within the meaning of Art.10 
bis of the Paris Convention. This provision does not create a full exclusive 
right.56 Significantly, under Article 22.2 (a), one must show that the public 
might be misled &mdash; a level of protection that resembles trade mark law.57 In fact, 
protection of GIs may be provided as collective or certification marks.58
</p>
<p>TRIPS provides a higher (Lisbon-type)59 level of protection for wines and 
spirits.60 Using a GI identifying wines or spirits for those not originating in the 
place indicated by the indication is prohibited, even where the true origin of 
the wines and spirits concerned is indicated and/or a translation is used and/
or the indication is accompanied by expressions such as &lsquo;kind&rsquo;, &lsquo;type&rsquo;, &lsquo;style&rsquo;, 
&lsquo;imitation&rsquo; or the like. There is no need here to show that the public might be 
misled  or that the use constitutes an act of unfair competition. Under Article 
22.3, a WTO member must, either ex officio if its national law so permits, or at 
the request of an interested party, refuse or invalidate61 the registration of a 
trade mark which contains or consists of a GI if (a) the goods do not originate 
in the territory indicated; and (b) use of the indication in the trade mark for 
such goods in the territory of the &lsquo;Member&rsquo; concerned is of such a nature as 
to mislead62 the public as to the true place of origin.63 Article 23.2 more or less 
corresponds to Article 22.3, but applies specifically to indications identifying 
wines and spirits, except of course that deception (misleading the public as to 
the true place of origin) need not be present. 
</p>
<p>(b) Conflicts with Prior Trade Marks
</p>
<p>Important conflict rules between GIs and trade marks are contained in TRIPS 
Articles 24.5 and 24.6. Under the former, a GI conflicting with a trade mark 
does not supersede the mark, provided that an application for registration of 
the mark was filed or the mark registered, or the right acquired by use (and the 
trade mark was in fact used in good faith)64 in the WTO member concerned either

61 Compare with &lsquo;cancellation&rsquo; in arts 15 and 19.
62 Article 22(2)(a) uses &lsquo;which misleads&rsquo;, Article 10bis(3) of the Paris Convention uses &lsquo;is liable to mislead&rsquo; 
and Article 22(3) uses &lsquo;is of such a nature as to mislead&rsquo;. The latter two tests seem very close indeed. The 
likelihood that the public will be misled may, as in the case of trade marks, be inferred in appropriate 
circumstances. 
63 This element could exclude marks having acquired a secondary meaning.
64 This test is sometimes difficult to apply, as evidence of good (or bad) faith is not always easy to produce. 
Showing bad faith based entirely on circumstances is sometimes rendered more difficult in legal systems that 
presume good faith until the contrary is shown. In applying the test, the fact that an indication is particularly </p>

</p>
<p>before the TRIPS Agreement became applicable in the member concerned,65 or 
before the indication in question was protected in its country of origin.66 A WTO 
panel examining the EC &mdash; Trademarks and Geographical Indications dispute 
explained that the co-existence of a protected indication and a trade mark was 
a limited exception justified under TRIPS Article 17.67 The purpose is to allow a 
trade mark to be registered (and registration applied for) and used, even if it is 
identical with or similar to a GI,68 provided, however, that the trade mark is at 
least applied for (including if it was registered, naturally) or the rights acquired 
through use, either before the WTO member concerned must apply Article 23 
or before the indication is protected in its country of origin. 
</p>
<p>Article 24.6 is also relevant in this context. It provides that WTO members may 
decide not to protect a GI used in connection with foreign goods or services for 
which the relevant indication is identical with the term customary in common 
language as the common name for such goods or services in the territory of that 
member.69 It also states that members are not required to protect foreign GIs &lsquo;with 
respect to products of the vine for which the relevant indication is identical with 
the customary name of a grape variety existing in the territory of that member as 
of the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement&rsquo;.70
</p>
<p>4. Traditional Innovation and GIs
</p>
<p>(a) Types of Traditional Knowledge in Traditional 
Innovation
In 2003, I suggested that one should distinguish four types of traditional 
knowledge (TK).71 This type of knowledge is likely to be a major source of 
traditional innovation and development. In thinking about this matrix, the 
</p>
<p>well known and/or used (directly or indirectly) by undertakings located in or near the &lsquo;true&rsquo; place of origin 
should be taken into account. See AIPPI, &lsquo;Working Guidelines Q191: Relationship Between Trademarks and 
Geographical Indications&rsquo; (Yearbook 2006/II), 18. 
65 For the most industrialised nations, 1 January 1996. See TRIPS Agreement, art 65.1. For developing countries 
other than least-developed ones, most substantive provisions of the Agreement applied as of 1 January 2000.

<p>6 . Traditional Innovation and the Ongoing Debate on the Protection of Geographical Indications
</p>
<p>133
</p>
<p>question to be answered is whether GIs may be used to capture the special 
value attributed to products embodying TK and, more particularly, any special 
value associated with a geographic origin following from the land the product 
comes from and/or the way in which the people living on that land produce the 
product. 
</p>
<p>The TK matrix I suggested looked as follows:
</p>
<p>I sacred tangible II secular tangible
</p>
<p>III sacred intangible IV secular intangible
</p>
<p>Q1 includes rights, including property rights in tangible objects used as part of 
or pertaining to something sacred. Examples include sacred sites. 
</p>
<p>Q2 includes rights in photographs, choreographies, music or audiovisual 
productions used in non-sacred events and ceremonies and often offered for 
sale to visitors and tourists;
</p>
<p>Q3 includes intellectual property and other intangible rights applicable to, e.g., 
knowledge, costumes, artistic works, etc.
</p>
<p>Q4 includes tangible arts and crafts (to which intangible rights may also apply); 
it may also be extended to apply to natural and genetic resources. 
</p>
<p>In its latest (2011) proposals on this issue, WIPO prefers to distinguish secret (as 
opposed to sacred) from non-secret TK.72 Arguably this is more practicable: a 
sacred practice may be kept secret. However, if its custodians have no objection 
to its public use, then presumably they may not require any specific legal 
protection to keep it from others. According to the proposed WIPO text, in 
respect of secret TK, beneficiaries of the right &lsquo;should have the means, through 
adequate and effective [legal and practical] appropriate measures, to prevent any 
unauthorized fixation, disclosure, use, or other exploitation&rsquo;.73 Independently of 
this debate on secret versus sacred, it seems rather self-evident that GIs will not 
be of much use for TK on the left-hand side of the matrix. GIs could, however, 
apply to some forms of secular or commercially exploitable forms of expressions 
of TK &mdash; that is, the right-hand side of the matrix. 
</p>
<p>The protection of GIs to assist in the development of traditional innovation is 
admittedly a limited tool. The following diagram (Figure 7) may help explicate 
the issues:

</p>
<p>Figure 7. The intersections of commerce, technology and culture
</p>
<p>In this diagram, culture must be defined broadly as the relationship with the 
land that forms part of a culture, but also to the very preservation of that land, 
including its biodiversity. The intersections in our diagram are instructive. 
The intersection between culture and commerce, for instance, happens when a 
traditional product, one in which a traditional culture is embedded, is marketed 
and becomes (potentially) subject to market forces. This is not incompatible 
with Traditional Innovation, the dynamic nature of which one cannot deny. 
However, this may lead to the intensification of the exploitation, in particular 
for agricultural-based products. 
</p>
<p>Technology might be brought to bear to intensify exploitation and increase 
outputs, thus generating additional income but increasing risks of changes to 
the traditional product and overexploitation of the land. The question becomes 
one of stewardship, community empowerment and the role of the state in 
protecting traditional communities (or not) against those risks.74
</p>
<p>Traditional innovation itself may often be situated at the intersection of &lsquo;culture&rsquo; 
and technology. By contrast, GIs are generally situated at the intersection of 
culture and commerce though in many cases also at the triple intersection (with 
technology). The main focus of GIs is on commercialisation, not preservation 
of the underlying knowledge. The additional resources that exploitation might 
</p>
<p>74 The Preamble to the TRIPS Agreement refers to intellectual property rights as private rights, a statement 
mostly designed to limit obligations of state enforcement of those rights. In the case of GIs, the communal 
(or state) ownership of the right and the link with broader cultural and societal aspects make GIs a special 
category of intellectual property, at least where they are protected not as simple trademarks but under a sui 
generis regime. Here the question is basically who decides if changes to an existing traditional product is 
acceptable, and on what basis. </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>6 . Traditional Innovation and the Ongoing Debate on the Protection of Geographical Indications
</p>
<p>135
</p>
<p>generate can help with preservation but they may also induce changes to increase 
efficiency that will in turn affect the product and underlying &lsquo;culture&rsquo;. As such, 
commercialisation may in some cases make preservation more difficult.75
</p>
<p>In New Zealand, for example, the way in which mātauranga Māori forms part 
of whakapapa; the custodianship (kaitiakitanga) of iwi, hapū (and perhaps 
individual whānau); and the forms of use (for example, the use of rongoā by 
tohunga) are all testimony to the fact that, while commercial exploitation of 
mātauranga Māori is not organically incapable &mdash; and certainly not unworthy &mdash; 
of commercial exploitation, that form of use has not been a primary driver for the 
preservation and development of mātauranga Māori.76 Additionally, the sacred/
secular and secret/non-secret distinction is not always easy to superimpose on 
knowledge that is typically situated and contextual.77  Yet resort to GIs might 
be appropriate for commercially exploited traditional innovation that outsiders 
might describe as secular or non-secret. As I discuss below, this requires some 
perhaps unpalatable &lsquo;packaging&rsquo; of TK to fit the GI scheme.
</p>
<p>In spite of those important shortcomings, the protection of GIs meshes well 
with several, perhaps most, of the normative concerns identified by WIPO in its 
efforts to design an international framework for non-secret TK protection. More 
specifically, it meshes with respect for traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), 
which WIPO defines as &lsquo;any form, tangible or intangible, or a combination 
thereof, in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied and have 
been passed on [from generation to generation],tangible or intangible forms of 
creativity of the beneficiaries&rsquo;.78 This includes stories, epics, legends, poetry, 
riddles and other narratives; words, signs, names and symbols; musical or sound 
expressions, such as songs and instrumental music, and the sounds which are 
the expression of rituals; dances, plays, ceremonies, rituals, rituals in sacred 
places; games, puppet performances, and other performances, whether fixed or 
unfixed; expressions of art; and architecture and tangible spiritual forms, and 
sacred places.79
</p>
<p>There would be much to say about this list and its juxtaposition with copyright, 
if the term &lsquo;expression&rsquo; were replaced with &lsquo;work&rsquo;. &lsquo;Expressions&rsquo; might be seen 
here as &uuml;ber-works, rights in which would belong to a community and may 
</p>
<p>75 The resources generated by commercialisation may also create the resources/interest in maintaining some 
food/drink-making and other traditions. 
76 I found the traditional approach to rongoā illustrative of the reductionist view of medicine and dominant 
Western memes in that respect. Few Western doctors &mdash; and fewer patients still &mdash; would argue that life-saving 
medicines have only a commercial value. They obviously have much broader social and spiritual implications.

</p>
<p>not expire. This difficult cohabitation has been discussed at length elsewhere. 
Moreover, most forms of intellectual property (designs, patents and so on) are 
vulnerable to the same critiques. By contrast, a permanent right (or non-expiring 
right after a certain date) belonging to a community is precisely what a GI is.
</p>
<p>I suggest that there are many other forms of TK that may be commercially 
exploited and in which a &lsquo;TK rent&rsquo; could be captured by a GI. Traditional 
knowledge more generally is defined in the latest draft WIPO document as:
</p>
<p>[I]ntellectual activity in a traditional context, and includes the know-how, 
skills, innovations, practices and learning that form part of traditional 
knowledge systems, and knowledge embodying traditional lifestyles of 
indigenous and local communities, or contained in codified knowledge systems 
passed between generations and continuously developed following any 
changes in the environment, geographical conditions and other factors. It 
is not limited to any specific technical field, and may include agricultural, 
environmental and medicinal knowledge, and any traditional knowledge 
associated with cultural expressions and genetic resources.80
</p>
<p>(b) Packaging TK as GIs to Promote Innovation
</p>
<p>There are several forms of TK that might thus lead to traditional innovation. 
Indeed, the use of GIs to generate &lsquo;development from within&rsquo; is not new, 
although it was mostly advocated for the &lsquo;global south&rsquo;.81 GIs have been linked 
to rural development in particular, and this may be compatible with many forms 
of indigenous innovation and production.82
</p>
<p>Several indigenous communities have developed sustainable land use and 
conservation models that are viewed by some environmental advocates as 
possible &lsquo;organic&rsquo; alternatives to pouring billions of tons of chemicals into 
the ground.83 Certain forms of environmental TK could be &lsquo;packaged&rsquo; as best-
practice models using GIs, much in the way that Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design standards have evolved over the past decades for &lsquo;green

</p>
<p>building&rsquo; certification.84 A possible example is the mosaic method of burning 
land used by indigenous peoples in Australia.85 A GI might apply to methods 
certified by custodians of this knowledge even if transported to a different 
technological domain, such as mosaic burning using helicopters.86
</p>
<p>Another form of traditional innovation might come from greater respect for the 
use of genetic resources. Those resources seem quintessentially linked to the 
land they originate from and thus natural candidates for GIs when exploited 
commercially or, indeed, to prevent their appropriation. One of the aspirational 
objectives suggested by WIPO in this context is to &lsquo;curtail the grant or exercise of 
improper intellectual property rights over traditional knowledge and associated 
genetic resources&rsquo;.87 In a separate set of proposals dealing specifically with 
genetic resources, one of the options identified by WIPO is to &lsquo;[e]nsure those 
accessing/using genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge comply 
with requirements for prior informed consent and fair and equitable benefit-
sharing, including customary laws and procedures of the communities&rsquo;.88  Some 
scholars point to the example of Maytenus buchaniti, a plant from the Shimba 
Hills of Kenya from which the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) developed a 
drug known as maytansine.89 While over twenty-seven tons of the shrub were 
collected, no agreement was made to either share or acknowledge its origin. A 
similar situation arose over the collection of Homalanthus nutans in the Samoan 
rainforest. In both cases, the work of the NCI was reportedly based at least in 
part on traditional medicinal knowledge about the plants.90
</p>
<p>The use of a GI could potentially play a slightly different role here &mdash; namely to 
acknowledge both origin as such and the fact that a benefit-sharing agreement 
is in place &mdash; if the use of the GI was authorised by its holder only after the 
successful conclusion of such an agreement. This type of GI protection seems 
consonant with efforts to get patent holders to disclose the origin of genetic 
resources used during the invention process.91

</p>
<p>This use of GIs on indigenous products might also coincide normatively with 
fair trade issues, although the two should not be confused.92 GIs more generally 
feed into the &lsquo;quality turn&rsquo; in consumer preferences and the emergence of 
&lsquo;values-based&rsquo; labels.93
</p>
<p>(c) Meeting the WIPO TK/TCEs Protection Objectives
</p>
<p>WIPO identifies several objectives that the protection of TK/TCEs should aim to 
achieve. These objectives seem consonant with GIs, perhaps more so than other 
intellectual property rights. Let us take a brief look at the most relevant aims in 
the WIPO proposal.
</p>
<p>(i) Recognise value
</p>
<p>This first aim is described as the recognition that &lsquo;indigenous peoples and 
communities and traditional and other cultural communities consider their 
cultural heritage to have intrinsic value, including social, cultural, spiritual, 
economic, scientific, intellectual, commercial and educational values&hellip;&rsquo; GIs 
capture and reflect the value that a community places on a product because of 
its origin. It embodies the &lsquo;land&rsquo; in the product much as authors&rsquo; rights embody 
the Hegelian &lsquo;author&rsquo; in the work.
</p>
<p>(ii) Promote respect
</p>
<p>The second aim is &lsquo;to promote respect for traditional cultures and folklore, and for 
the dignity, cultural integrity, and the philosophical, intellectual and spiritual 
values of the peoples and communities that preserve and maintain expressions of 
these cultures and folklore&rsquo;.94 The GI is a symbol of the origin of the product, 
and the fact that consumers both recognise this origin and are willing to pay for 
it is arguably a mark of respect, but at the very least it might afford economic 
tools to the custodians to help them preserve and maintain the knowledge 
embodied in the making of the product and perhaps others forms of TK.
</p>
<p>(iii) Meet the actual needs of communities
</p>
<p>This aim, to be &lsquo;guided by the aspirations and expectations expressed directly 
by indigenous peoples and communities and by traditional and other cultural 
communities, respect their rights under national/domestic and international law,

</p>
<p>and contribute to the welfare and sustainable economic, cultural, environmental 
and social development of such peoples and communities&rsquo;,95 is likewise well 
served for some forms of TK. The GI registration process is itself an expression of 
the aspiration and expectation that the product, and specifically the natural and 
human factors at its point of origin, should be protected, and its exploitation 
might contribute to the welfare of the community of origin.
</p>
<p>(iv) Prevent the misappropriation and misuse of traditional cultural 
expressions
</p>
<p>This aim is defined as providing &lsquo;indigenous peoples and communities and 
traditional and other cultural communities with the legal and practical means, 
including effective enforcement measures, to prevent the misappropriation 
of their cultural expressions [&hellip;] and [control] ways in which they are used 
beyond the customary and traditional context and promote the equitable sharing 
of benefits arising from their use&rsquo;.96 An internationally recognised GI would 
arguably prevent the use of tradition and know-how embodied in a product, 
with or without consumer confusion. It is clearly designed to tackle use outside 
the community, notably when the product enters (international) channels of 
commerce. Whether the use is a misappropriation without consumer confusion is 
a separate debate. Increasingly, however, the need for confusion is disappearing 
as the mooring of trade mark law as global brands get protection well beyond the 
traditional contours of passing off.97 This is normatively questionable for pure 
commercial marks, in particular as it affects freedom of expression. However, 
the Lisbon system is a high form of protection that recognises the special nature 
of GIs (even where they might be protected under a trade mark regime).
</p>
<p>(v) Empower communities
</p>
<p>The aim is to find a balanced and equitable yet effective manner to empower 
&lsquo;indigenous peoples and communities and traditional and other cultural 
communities to exercise in an effective manner their rights and authority 
over their own traditional cultural expressions&rsquo;. GIs must be balanced against 
other concerns, including freedom of expression and consumer interests. I 
am certainly not suggesting a watertight right that would go beyond what is 
required to achieve the aim of protecting equitably the legitimate interests of 
the holder and custodians. In the Lisbon context, the debates have focused not 
on conflicts with, say, (other) human rights, but on conflicts with trade marks 
appropriating pre-existing GIs (often in good faith).98

</p>
<p>(vi) Contribute to safeguarding traditional cultures
</p>
<p>WIPO suggests that TK/TCE protection &lsquo;should contribute to the preservation 
and safeguarding of the environment in which traditional cultural expressions 
are generated and maintained, for the direct benefit of indigenous peoples 
and communities and traditional and other cultural communities, and for the 
benefit of humanity in general&rsquo;. GIs may contribute to this aim by making the 
preservation and maintenance of the knowledge associated with the making of 
a GI product easier.
</p>
<p>(vii) Encourage community innovation and creativity
</p>
<p>This aim is to &lsquo;reward and protect tradition-based creativity and innovation 
especially by indigenous peoples and communities and traditional and other 
cultural communities&rsquo;. GIs function mostly as guarantors of tradition. Yet, as 
products enter channels of commerce, innovation might be more easily rewarded 
&mdash; for example, in the creation of versions of the products that combine GI-
protected knowledge and new ideas.
</p>
<p>(viii) Contribute to cultural diversity
</p>
<p>This aim is to &lsquo;contribute to the promotion and protection of the diversity 
of cultural expressions&rsquo;. Having access to more products produced in local 
communities around the world might contribute to this objective by making 
consumers more aware of the cultural aspects at the point of origin which infuse 
</p>
<p>recent decisions. Anheuser-Busch Inbev essentially won a case before the European Court of Justice (Grand 
Chamber) decided on 8 September 2009 (Case C 478/07). The Court decided that EC law was exhaustive in 
respect of appellations for beer and that additional protection in a bilateral agreement between Austria and 
the Czech Republic was ineffective. Earlier, on 16 December 2008, the Court of First Instance of the European 
Communities (CFI) overturned four decisions by the Board of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the 
Internal Market (OHIM). See Budějovick&yacute; Budvar v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade 
Marks and Designs), Joined Cases T 225/06, T 255/06, T 257/06 and T 309/06, 16 December 2008. For a 
discussion of the judicial saga, see N Resinek, &lsquo;Geographical Indications and Trade Marks: Coexistence or 
&ldquo;First in Time, First in Right&rdquo; Principle&rsquo; (2007) 29 European Intellectual Property Review 446, 447. The crux 
of the debate in the Court of First Instance was whether the appellant had shown it was the proprietor of 
a sign &lsquo;of more than mere local significance. &lsquo;Use&rsquo;, as the Court rightly noted (and, on this point, agreeing 
with the OHIM Board), means &lsquo;genuine use of a trade mark where the mark is used in accordance with its 
essential function, which is to guarantee the identity of the origin of the goods or services for which it is 
registered, in order to create or preserve an outlet for those goods or services; genuine use does not include 
token use for the sole purpose of preserving the rights conferred by the registration.&rsquo; (CFI Opinion, para 161.) 
In a somewhat unconvincing twist, the Court then found that this rule, which it says applies to earlier trade 
marks, did not apply to &lsquo;when, as in the present case, the sign is an appellation of origin registered under the 
Lisbon Agreement or an appellation protected under the bilateral convention&rsquo;, see ibid, para 163. If one were 
to accept this conclusion of law, (not necessarily) genuine use in one European Union member state whose law 
does not protect a given appellation may be combined with the legal protection available in a different member 
state where no facts establish use (whether genuine or not). Concerning the &lsquo;not merely local&rsquo; requirement, the 
Court limited itself to a finding that protection under Lisbon in a country other than the country of origin is 
sufficient, even, it seems, without any factual evidence, see ibid, para 181.</p>

</p>
<p>the product with special value and, generally, by insisting on the importance of 
less uniform sources for food and other GI products. This feeds into the desire 
expressed by many consumers to know more about what they eat and drink.99
</p>
<p>(ix) Promote the [community] development of indigenous peoples 
and communities and traditional and other cultural communities and 
legitimate trading activities
</p>
<p>For reasons that are discussed above, GIs would likely &lsquo;promote the use of 
traditional cultural expressions for the [community based] development 
of indigenous peoples and communities and traditional and other cultural 
communities&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>(x) Preclude unauthorised intellectual property rights
</p>
<p>This aim was mentioned above. It is more an effect than a normative claim. GIs 
would &lsquo;preclude the grant, exercise and enforcement of intellectual property 
rights acquired by unauthorized parties over traditional cultural expressions 
and [derivatives] [adaptations] thereof&rsquo;. This does not avoid, however, the need 
to deal fairly with issues concerning pre-existing trade marks. In addition, if 
&lsquo;unauthorized&rsquo; is extended to mean use of genetic resources without a benefit-
sharing agreement in place, then use of a GI that would increase value and 
benefit all those involved in the distribution chain could be licensed only if 
such an agreement was in place. Conversely, one must prevent the use of GIs to 
misappropriate the GI rent that is associated with a specific origin.100
</p>
<p>If a GIs system is implemented as a certification of collective mark, which the 
Lisbon Agreement allows, typically the state will not check the validity of the 
claimant&rsquo;s rights. This may increase the risk of misappropriation.
</p>
<p>(xi) Enhance certainty, transparency and mutual confidence
</p>
<p>The final aim is to enhance &lsquo;certainty, transparency, mutual respect and 
understanding in relations between indigenous peoples and communities 
and traditional and cultural communities, on the one hand, and academic, 
commercial, governmental, educational and other users of traditional cultural 
expressions, on the other&rsquo;. It might be served by providing proper recognition 
for the value of the origin of a product based on tradition. Respect is often the 
first and most important step to a fruitful dialogue.

next section below.</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>142
</p>
<p>In sum, the protection of GIs, properly calibrated, could serve the aims identified 
by WIPO (after years of serious deliberation on the issue) that the protection of 
TK should strive to achieve.
</p>
<p>(d) Issues
</p>
<p>The use of GIs will not go forward without significant issues, however. These will 
emerge in any scenario where a collective right is established or recognised. The 
major issue might be one of ownership, meant here as the authority to license 
the use of a GI. Because GIs are anchored in the land, forced displacements 
of indigenous peoples (due to colonisation, for example) or &lsquo;artificial&rsquo; colonial 
borders that do not map well over actual land use might lead to conflicts of 
ownership. As with the Pisco issue between Chile and Peru, there are potential 
sharing arrangements that could be negotiated.101 Admittedly, the optimal use 
of GIs also relies on the assumption that a collective ownership arrangement can 
in fact be established even without a conflict among two peoples, clans, and so 
on.
</p>
<p>Another troubling prospect is the capture of a GI by &lsquo;powerful extralocal actors&rsquo;, 
as was apparently the case with an otherwise very successful GI, Tequila.102 This 
and the ownership issue mentioned previously are examples of what might be 
referred to more generally as issues of governance. This supports the case for a 
strong but fair involvement by the state.103
</p>
<p>A second set of problems is the possible emergence of micro-GIs. While micro-
GIs, like (micro-)niche products are not necessarily a negative, the risk is that 
they might overcrowd the GI space for a specific product class if each clan, 
tribe, nation and so on has a version of what is perceived as essentially the 
same thing. As the product use moves further from its point of origin, this 
may become more acute. French consumers may be familiar with hundreds of 
wine appellations, for example, but that may not be true elsewhere. A single GI 
system, even if international by design, needs to be used globally for every GI, 
however. There are three &lsquo;circles&rsquo; of erga omnes protection. A first circle would 
be to the territory of origin; another would be a regional circle &mdash; or perhaps a 
non-geographically delimited circle of like-minded countries taking similar or 
compatible approaches to the protection of TK. A third possible circle would be 
an extension to all WIPO and/or WTO members. Naturally, the first level can 
be established by a local law. The second circle requires a regional or sectoral

bottlers on issues such as the minimum required proportion of agave for Tequila to bear the name, and the 
exportation of bulk Tequila (tequila mixto). That said, GIs cannot be either delocalised or outsourced.

</p>
<p>agreement, providing for (for example) reciprocal protection. Yet all three can 
make use of an international system, even if not all micro-GIs are used globally. 
In my view, the real challenge is to successfully pick and use some GIs globally 
without overcrowding. 
</p>
<p>5. A Protocol to the Lisbon Agreement as TK 
Protection
</p>
<p>(a) Towards a Protocol
</p>
<p>We have now seen the two existing international frameworks for GIs (Lisbon 
and TRIPS) and demonstrated that GIs might serve the needs of custodians of 
TK. In our look at Lisbon, we saw that the system is not widely subscribed to, 
especially in the &lsquo;New World&rsquo;, owing to real or perceived deficiencies. A second 
level of enquiry is to ask how TRIPS and Lisbon should interface. A protocol 
to the Lisbon Agreement could certainly ameliorate and revitalise the current 
system. I also suggest that it could and should tackle the interface issue in a way 
that reflects the concerns and interests of TK custodians and users.
</p>
<p>The question to ask at this juncture is whether a protocol is realistic to begin 
with, and then how would it interface with TRIPS norms. In a recent paper, I 
argued that there were two ways to proceed. The first I termed Lisbon Light. 
Under this approach, WTO members would establish a new international 
register, possibly limited to wines and spirits, to be administered by WIPO, 
thus relying on the expertise of the Lisbon staff and, more generally, on WIPO&rsquo;s 
experience in administering international intellectual property registration 
systems. The protocol would mirror the current registration process but apply 
to GIs (copying the TRIPS definition) and contain no substantive protection 
norms. Essentially, under this approach a new multilateral system is established 
but most substantive rules set aside, thus allowing TRIPS and the WTO dispute 
settlement system to fill the gap. This would be of little help as TK protection, 
especially if limited to wines and spirits.
</p>
<p>The second approach (which I favour) I called a TRIPS Zero protocol. Under this 
second approach, WIPO members would adopt a protocol that mirrors not just 
the administrative provisions of the current Lisbon system but also the TRIPS 
provisions concerning GIs, and conflicts between GIs and trade marks.104 The 
register would be open to all products. 
</p>
<p>104 Naturally, &lsquo;TRIPS provisions&rsquo; is potentially a dynamic notion, as TRIPS may be amended in the future. 
An amendment to the TRIPS Agreement was adopted by a decision of the WTO General Council of 6 December 
2005, art 31bis. See Amendment to the TRIPS Agreement, WTO Doc WT/L/641 (2005). </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>144
</p>
<p>(b) Applicable Precedents
</p>
<p>There are clear precedents. First, in 1989 a Protocol to the 1891 Madrid 
Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks was adopted.105 
More countries are party to this Protocol (83) than to the original Agreement 
(56).106
</p>
<p>The core idea is simple: step out of the historical flange-ways and known road 
blocks, and thus avoid the related path dependency which has manifested itself 
in sui generis regimes with particular attributes, such as their variable precedence 
over prior marks, and establish a true multilateral register for denominations of 
origin to which products owe specific qualities, characteristics and indeed their 
reputation in the marketplace.
</p>
<p>On the substantive side, a second relevant precedent is the addition of TRIPS-
compatible norms in new WIPO instruments. A recent precedent is the adoption 
of two &lsquo;Internet&rsquo; treaties in 1996.107
</p>
<p>Clearly, no country should have to adhere to the Lisbon Agreement to adhere to 
the Protocol, and not just countries could join. A full revision would also make 
it possible for intergovernmental bodies, such as the European Union, to join.108
</p>
<p>(c) Application to Other Products
</p>
<p>The question of the application of a new register to products other than wines 
and spirits must be tackled if the needs of TK holders and custodians are to be 
addressed. 
</p>
<p>Under TRIPS Article 23.4, the new multilateral register need only apply to wine, 
although political agreement exists to extend it to spirits.109 If WTO members 
agreed to extend high (Article 23) protection to all products, then the register 
could be opened to reflect such an extension. Another possibility, which I 
consider a possible solution to the extension quagmire, is to establish a register 
with two distinct domains: one for wines and spirits (the traditional domain of 
appellations), for which Article 23 protection would apply; and one for all other 
products, for which Article 22 protection would apply (that is, more generally 
to all &lsquo;indications&rsquo;). In my suggestion, existing Lisbon entries would not be

<p>extended to protocol members, and the protocol would require a per-country 
notification (as most other international applications and registrations do), as 
opposed to applying to all Lisbon Protocol members by default.
</p>
<p>(d) Comparison with Most Recent WIPO Proposals
</p>
<p>In March 2011, WIPO released proposed changes to the Lisbon system.110 They 
are in large part consonant with the above analysis and recommendations. The 
main proposed changes are as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Allowing members to recognise appellations and/or indications, without 
having actually to use either term. This is useful mostly on a political level, 
by allowing members to keep current systems, and a spate system for wines 
and spirits, on the one hand, and for other products on the other. European 
legislation recognises both. The practical distinction is less clear.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 An &lsquo;entity&rsquo; should be designated in each member to process international 
applications for registration, although the source of the right in a given 
member may be a legislative or administrative act, a judicial decision or 
national registration. However, under one proposal, federations, associations 
and other persons could apply directly &lsquo;provided that the application is 
accompanied by a document signed by the competent authority&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 The protocol would allow intergovernmental organisations (for example, the 
European Union) to join.
</p>
<p>&bull;	 Finally, the proposals on substantive rights and the priority of prior marks 
more or less track TRIPS, though not specifically on the spate status of wines 
and spirits.
</p>
<p>Those proposals are a great step in the right direction. They would allow the 
emergence of a multilateral GI system that could be used for commercially 
exploited GIs on traditional knowledge, without discrimination as to the type 
of product and without endangering prior marks used in good faith, subject to 
specific rules in each member state. 
</p>
<p>6. Conclusion
</p>
<p>The aim of this chapter has been to demonstrate that the 1958 Lisbon Agreement 
on the Protection and Registration of Appellations of Origin could, if properly 
revised by way of a protocol, function as a multilateral register for GIs of 
products of all types. This type of collective right is unique in intellectual

<p>property law, a set of rules developed in Western Europe, with limited input 
from other industrialised nations, starting in the late nineteenth century and 
reflecting a belief in the individuality of the author and inventor and of the need 
to reward and/or protect individuals because of their intellectual contribution. 
By contrast, the Lisbon Agreement and the related provisions on GIs in the 
TRIPS Agreement focus on collective knowledge rooted in land and tradition, 
a notion that may appeal much more naturally to custodians of TK desiring 
to commercially exploit forms of TK to develop local innovation and improve 
economic development. This would apply to TCEs such as crafts, as well as to 
food and to more technical knowledge such as land use and conservation and 
traditional medicines.
</p>
<p>I discussed the possible use of GIs to reflect the presence of an appropriate 
benefit-sharing and disclosure of origin agreement (as recognised by the right to 
use the GI). While an amendment to TRIPS on this point seems unlikely, a Doha 
Round result &mdash; if it ever materialises &mdash; could include a Ministerial Declaration 
on this issue.111
</p>
<p>The chapter also argues that the revision of the Lisbon Agreement should 
bring it closer to the multilateral register foreseen in Article 23.4 of the TRIPS 
Agreement. To achieve this goal, I considered the substantive differences 
between the notions of GI used in TRIPS and of appellation of origin used in the 
Lisbon Agreement. I also considered the level of protection in Lisbon, and rules 
concerning conflicts between indications and trade marks, a major sticking 
point in the development of the international protection of GIs.
</p>
<p>I also reviewed the compatibility of GIs with the main aims identified by WIPO 
(after years of deliberations) that a system to protect TK should achieve, and 
found a significant degree of consonance between the two. Finally, I applied 
the relevant findings to the protection of TK and concluded that a TRIPS Zero 
protocol, reflecting the substantive TRIPS rules in the possible protocol, would 
be better for TK protection, and noted the existence of credible precedents to 
show that the conclusion of a protocol is realistic.112

<p>7. The Branding of Traditional 
Cultural Expressions: To Whose 
</p>
<p>Benefit?1
</p>
<p>Daphne Zografos Johnsson
</p>
<p>1. Introduction
</p>
<p>This chapter is concerned with the legal issues surrounding the branding of 
traditional cultural expressions (TCEs). Over the past few decades, ethnicity 
trends combined with today&rsquo;s digital culture have prompted a significant 
increase in both the commercial and non-commercial branding of TCEs by 
indigenous communities as well as by third parties. Branding is a process that 
involves the creation of a unique name and image for a product in the consumers&rsquo; 
mind through advertising campaigns or merchandising with a consistent theme. 
Branding aims to establish a significant and differentiated presence in the 
marketplace that attracts and retains loyal customers. It is not limited to goods 
and services, and can also apply to people, places and communities. 
</p>
<p>Traditional words, images, symbols, music, performances or objects are 
increasingly being used to brand products, people, communities, corporations 
and disciplines. Third-party branding practices that use indigenous names, 
signs and symbols raise issues of ownership, authorisation, attribution and 
exploitation. On the other hand, some indigenous communities would like 
themselves to benefit from the branding of their TCEs and to protect their 
economic interests in indigenous names, signs and symbols. In this perspective, 
the holders of TCEs are concerned about how best to use intellectual property 
rights (IPRs) as differentiation tools in the marketplace, prevent misappropriation 
and misuse, and contribute to the preservation and safeguarding of indigenous 
names, signs and symbols, and of TCEs generally.
</p>

World Intellectual Property Organization or any of its Member States. A version of this paper was delivered at 
the Trade, Intellectual Property and the Knowledge Assets of Indigenous Peoples: The Development Frontier 
conference at Victoria University of Wellington, 8-10 December 2010. The trip to New Zealand was funded by

</p>
<p>This chapter examines how intellectual property (IP) tools can assist indigenous 
communities in addressing the above issues in relation to the branding of their 
TCEs.
</p>
<p>2. Third-party Branding
</p>
<p>(a) Ownership and Authorisation
</p>
<p>Some of the questions that may arise in relation to third-party branding of TCEs 
are: who owns TCEs, who can authorise their branding, and in which situations 
is such an authorisation required?2 Very often, it may not be possible for those 
wishing to exploit TCEs to identify who to get consent from. This may be the 
case, for example, in situations where paternity is lost or contested, or where 
such expressions have been produced within a community, and where it is not 
possible to identify a specific author or authors, but where the paternity and 
ownership are vested in the community as a whole. Indeed, the very nature of 
TCEs is often that they do not have an author, but are attributable to a cultural 
group or traditional community who are seen as the &lsquo;guardians&rsquo; of the work, 
and have responsibility for the work, but do not &lsquo;own&rsquo; the work in the Western 
copyright sense. Having said that, the distinction between individual IPRs and 
communal traditional knowledge (TK) rights is often an oversimplification, and 
it should also be kept in mind that there is not one single model of a communal 
TK rights system.3
</p>
<p>While it is accepted that many indigenous communities generate and share 
knowledge from generation to generation collectively, there are also situations 
in which individual members of these communities can be recognised as creators 
or inventors distinct from their community. In many cases, contemporary works 
inspired by traditional styles can and do have an author, and this author can 
benefit from IP protection such as copyright. Despite that, in some traditional 
communities the right to create contemporary TCEs and to use pre-existing 
styles or designs resides with the traditional owners or custodians, who together 
have the authority to determine whether these TCEs can be used in an artwork 
and by whom the artwork may be created or exploited.4

<p>(b) Attribution
</p>
<p>The holders of TCEs would like the right to be attributed for their TCEs, as 
well as to be able to object to any false attribution. The latter issue may arise 
where, for example, imitation products are presented as genuine TCEs in the 
marketplace. In some industries, it has become common practice to promote non-
indigenous products and businesses by using indigenous or traditional names 
or signs as brand names, trade marks and business names, because consumer 
belief in authenticity lends tremendous weight and value to cultural objects 
and handicrafts.5 Holders of TCEs are concerned that this practice misleads 
consumers by falsely suggesting a connection with the community, and leads 
consumers to believe that the business is owned and run by indigenous people, 
or that benefits flow back to indigenous or traditional communities.
</p>
<p>(c) Exploitation by Third Parties
</p>
<p>Over the past decades, there has been an increasing use, in the course of trade, 
of indigenous names, signs and symbols by third parties. Well-publicised 
examples of unauthorised use of such signs can be found in various parts of the 
world.
</p>
<p>In Canada, names of First Nations, such as Algonquin, Mohawk, Haida and 
Cherokee, as well as symbols such as Indian heads, tepees or tomahawks, are 
used as trade marks by many non-Aboriginal companies to market products 
ranging from firearms and axes to tobacco, gasoline and cars.6 In the United 
States, there are many examples of exploitation of Indian names and imagery, 
notably in relation to college or professional sports teams&rsquo; names. It is estimated 
that more than 2,600 high school, college or professional teams have used Native 
American names and images as mascots, logos and team names.7
</p>
<p>In New Zealand, there are many examples of unauthorised use of Māori imagery 
and text by third parties. They include the use of Māori and Polynesian names 
</p>
<p>well recognised totems of the clan, resides in the traditional owners (or custodians) of the stories or images 
[&hellip;] [w]ho together have the authority to determine whether the story and images may be used in an artwork, 
by whom the artwork may be created, to whom it may be published, and the terms, if any, on which the 
artwork may be reproduced. [...] If unauthorised reproduction of a story or imagery occurs, under Aboriginal 
law it is the responsibility of the traditional owners to take action to preserve the dreaming, and to punish 
those considered responsible for the breach. [&hellip;] If permission has been given by the traditional owners 
to a particular artist to create a picture of the dreaming, and that artwork is later inappropriately used or 
reproduced by a third party, the artist is held responsible for the breach which has occurred, even if the artist 
had no control, or knowledge, of what occurred.&rsquo;

icons, such as a hei tiki (greenstone pendant personifying a human ancestor), 
on paper mats produced by McDonalds and used in their restaurants to cover 
food trays;10 the use of tā moko (Māori facial tattoo)11 on the boot of a Ford truck; 
the use of the words &lsquo;MAORI MIX&rsquo;, together with a quasi-Māori design and a 
map of New Zealand, by tobacco company Philip Morris to market cigarettes 
in Israel;12 and the use of Māori imagery in the fashion industry:13 for example, 
the use of interlocking curvilinear koru designs on women&rsquo;s swimsuits by New 
Zealand swimwear manufacturer Moontide in 1998, or Paco Rabanne&rsquo;s Spring 
1998 collection featuring two models wearing metal outfits reproducing a 
stylised moko, to name only a few. 
</p>
<p>In addition to the commercial exploitation of Māori imagery and text, many 
personalities have demonstrated a growing fascination with Māori culture. 
Celebrities such as rock star Robbie Williams and boxer Mike Tyson have 
exhibited Māori-style tattoos, and soccer player Eric Cantona appeared on the 
cover of British style magazine GQ with a painted moko on his face. In 1997, 
the Spice Girls caused offence when they performed a spontaneous haka with 
fans in Bali.14
</p>
<p>Finally, a growing number of imitation products, mass-produced outside New 
Zealand, or by non-Māori artists, can be found on the New Zealand market, 
</p>
<p>8 In 2001, Danish toy company Lego launched a game called Bionicle, which was challenged by Māori tribes 
for using Māori and Polynesian names, such as tohunga (a spiritual healer). The storyline of Bionicle is said 
to be based on stories told by the Rapa Nui people, who live on Easter Island. It features a range of action 
figures who inhabit an imaginary island called Mata Nui, which has fallen under the control of an evil spirit. 
The mission of the six heroes, called the Toa (meaning an especially brave Māori warrior), with names such 
as Whenua (land) or Pohatu (stone), is to liberate the inhabitants of the island. Māori groups approached 
Lego saying they considered the use of the Māori language by Lego to be inappropriate and offensive. After 
initially claiming that it hadn&rsquo;t done anything illegal, Lego later admitted it had drawn partly on Polynesian 
culture for inspiration and had borrowed names from the Māori culture to spice up its toys. The company said 
that &lsquo;future launches of Bionicle sets will not incorporate names from any original culture&rsquo;. Furthermore, it 
added that it &lsquo;will seek to develop a code of conduct for cultural expressions of traditional knowledge&rsquo;. See

9 In March 2003, Sony PlayStation released a game called the Mark of Kri, featuring Rau, a warrior wearing a 
facial tattoo and carrying a taiaha (an ancient Māori weapon). The game was criticised by Māori IP campaigners 
for its &lsquo;inappropriate and upsetting usage of New Zealand Māori imagery&rsquo;. In addition, they thought that 
Rau was promoted as a violent barbarian, thus portraying Māori in a negative manner to the international 
audience and linking them with stereotyped violence.

</p>

</p>
<p>mainly for the tourism industry, to the detriment of local authentic works. It is 
argued that these products deprive Māori artists of a reliable source of income, 
and many are considered offensive. Examples of offensive products include tiki 
pendants made from modern materials such as plastic instead of the traditional 
pounamu (greenstone), and Matryoshka dolls (Russian-style nesting dolls) 
featuring a Māori whānau (extended family), that are being sold at tourist gift 
stores. The dolls were designed by a New Zealand artist and made to order in 
China. According to Aroha Mead, a senior lecturer in Māori business studies at 
Victoria University, the dolls are an insult to traditional artists: &lsquo;if you compare 
these to authentic Russian dolls, which are well-designed and beautiful with 
very intricate patterns, they are cheap and simplistic. They certainly don&rsquo;t have 
anything to do with Māori culture [&hellip;] I don&rsquo;t think any Māori would make 
something like this.&rsquo;15
</p>
<p>The unauthorised exploitation of TCEs by third parties raises a series of 
questions and concerns. When is borrowing from a traditional culture 
legitimate, and when is it inappropriate, offensive adaptation or copying? While 
there is no single set of concerns in relation to third-party branding of TCEs, 
some common elements can be found. Indigenous communities would like to 
get protection against the misappropriation and misuse of indigenous names, 
signs and symbols. They would like to control the ways in which TCEs are 
used beyond the customary and traditional context, and get equitable sharing 
of benefits arising from that use. In addition, they would like to prevent the 
inappropriate and/or offensive use of indigenous names, signs and symbols, and 
the unauthorised use and commercial exploitation of culturally sensitive names, 
signs and symbols. Indigenous names, signs and symbols can have a sacred and 
cultural significance, and using sacred or culturally sensitive names, signs and 
symbols outside their traditional context, and in ways contrary to customary 
laws, may cause offence and undermine the social organisation of traditional 
communities. Also, they would like to preclude the grant, exercise and 
enforcement of IPRs acquired by unauthorised parties, such as the unauthorised 
use or the trade mark registration of identical, similar or suggestive signs on 
imitation products in the marketplace. Finally, they would like to prevent false 
or misleading indications in trade that suggest endorsement or linkage with a 
community or tradition-based creations. 
</p>
<p>Some IP tools can and have been used, with varying levels of success, to address 
some of these concerns. The next paragraphs focus on the use of trade mark 
law. The trade mark law system can provide protection against offensive and 
deceptive uses of indigenous names, signs and symbols, and has the ability to 
prevent third parties from using the signs.

</p>
<p>3. Trade Mark Protection Against Offensive 
and Deceptive Use
</p>
<p>To be registered as a trade mark, a sign must satisfy the criteria of registrability 
which are laid down by the law. Some signs may be subject to absolute bars 
to registration and therefore be inherently unregistrable. These absolute bars 
exclude from registration signs that are contrary to public order or morality 
and may therefore be considered offensive to sections of the community, such as 
indigenous groups, and signs that are deceptive.
</p>
<p>(a) Offensive Marks
</p>
<p>The concepts of &lsquo;contrary to morality&rsquo; or &lsquo;contrary to public order&rsquo; are very 
broad, and require a value judgement to be made by trade mark registries. 
Offence may relate to words and/or images, and to matters of race, sex, religious 
beliefs, general matters of taste and decency, or, in our case, cultural offence. 
There are examples in various jurisdictions of stakeholders attempting to use 
absolute grounds to prevent the registration of trade marks containing offensive 
imagery and text. In New Zealand, the Trade Marks Act was amended in 2002 
to take into account cultural offensiveness during the trade mark registration 
process. Under the New Zealand Trade Marks Act 2002, a trade mark application 
can be denied on grounds of cultural offence to significant sections of the 
community, and in particular to Māori.16 In addition, the Act provides for the 
creation of an advisory committee to help the Commissioner of Trade Marks 
assess the potential offensiveness of trade marks. In the United States, a trade 
mark may be refused registration if it consists of matter that may disparage, or 
falsely suggest a connection with, persons, living or dead, beliefs, or national 
symbols, or bring them into contempt or disrepute.17
</p>
<p>(b) Deceptive Marks
</p>
<p>If the trade mark applied for seems to suggest that the good or service has an 
indigenous origin, where such origin would be a significant factor for the average 
consumer, and this is not actually the case, the trade mark must be objected. 
The prohibition will apply to marks which, though distinctive, contain some

</p>
<p>kind of suggestion or allusion that is inaccurate. The risk of deception must, 
however, be a real one, and fanciful trade marks will be accepted even though 
they might be deceptive.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that trade mark law will not prevent the offensive or deceptive 
use of indigenous names, signs and symbols where the user does not seek to 
register a trade mark,18 nor will it prevent the registration of indigenous names, 
signs and symbols by third parties where the signs are not considered offensive 
or deceptive.
</p>
<p>4. Trade Mark Registration to Prevent Others 
from Using the Sign
</p>
<p>Holders of TCEs may also register indigenous names, signs or symbols to remove 
them from the field of trade and business, and prevent them from being used 
by third parties. 
</p>
<p>In Canada, the First Nations peoples have registered a series of petroglyphs 
(ancient rock painting images) as &lsquo;official marks&rsquo;19 to prevent their improper use 
by third parties. They wanted to protect the petroglyphs from unauthorised 
reproduction and commodification on commercial items such as T-shirts, 
jewellery and postcards. The petroglyphs have special religious significance to 
the members of the First Nation Snuneymuxw people, who considered such 
uses offensive. Once the petroglyphs were registered as official marks, the 
Snuneymuxw were able to ask local shops to cease selling items that reproduced 
the registered images without permission. Members of the Snuneymuxw First 
Nation subsequently indicated that local merchants and commercial artisans 
did stop using the petroglyph images, and that the trade mark registration, 
accompanied by an education campaign to make others aware of the significance 
of the petroglyphs to the Snuneymuxw First Nation, had been very successful.20
</p>
<p>18 In situations where the a third party does not seek to register a trade mark, it may be possible to use 
unfair competition laws or passing off to prevent competitors from misrepresenting their goods as to the 
source or quality, i.e. to prevent them from suggesting that they originate from a community or are authentic/
genuine goods.
19 &lsquo;Official marks&rsquo; are special types of marks under section 9 of the Canadian Trade-Marks Act which 
prohibit the adoption, in connection with a business, of any badge, crest, emblem or mark which has been 
adopted or used by a public authority. In turn, a &lsquo;public authority&rsquo; is defined as any entity which operates 
under a significant degree of government control and whose activities benefit the public as opposed to 
profiting private interests. Aboriginal groups and native organisations which meet these criteria are eligible 
to qualify as public authorities.

Knowledge, WIPO Doc WIPO/GRTKF/IC/4/7 (2002), annex II, 1.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>154
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the defensive use of trade marks may require an 
amendment to the trade mark legislation of countries in which the commercial 
use of trade marks is mandatory. Furthermore, in some countries, national 
legislation requires that only legitimate businesses may file for trade mark 
registration. Such a requirement would also impose an amendment.
</p>
<p>The trade mark system does not offer a comprehensive system of protection, 
as it would be prohibitively expensive to register all names, signs and symbols 
associated with a community&rsquo;s TK and TCEs. It would also be unreasonable and 
unrealistic to consider, or to aim for, a blanket prohibition on the use of all 
words and imagery with an indigenous connotation. 
</p>
<p>5. Branding by the Holders of TCEs
</p>
<p>Brands are multi-faceted tools that can also be used to the advantage of the 
holders of TCEs for the purpose of identification, authentication, protection and 
commercial exploitation of their own products. In particular, where issues of 
livelihood, reward and profitability are prominent motivators for the creation 
of cultural expressions, the use of marketing strategies and IPRs can be very 
valuable. 
</p>
<p>The recipe for a successful business is one that uses quality products, a 
distinctive brand and an effective marketing strategy. The essence of branding 
lies in its capacity to foster the sales of a product by creating an emotional 
link with its consumers. This should in turn be combined with an effective 
marketing strategy that will create demand for the product. These key elements 
are often coupled with other important factors, such as raw materials, financial 
capital, good distribution networks and special skills.21
</p>
<p>From an IP perspective, successful branding can involve the use of legal tools such 
as trade marks, certification and collective marks, and geographical indications 
(GIs), each operating according to their own sets of rules and pursuing related 
yet distinct objectives of protection. The following paragraphs will examine 
each of these IPRs in turn.
</p>
<p>(a) Trade Marks
</p>
<p>Trade marks are signs which distinguish goods or services of one undertaking 
from those of other undertakings,22 and convey information about the source 
</p>
<p>21 See ITC and WIPO, &lsquo;Marketing Crafts and Visual Arts: The Role of Intellectual Property. A Practical 
Guide&rsquo; (ITC and WIPO, Geneva, 2003) 13.
22 TRIPS Agreement, art 15(1).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7. The Branding of Traditional Cultural Expressions: To Whose Benefit?
</p>
<p>155
</p>
<p>or trade origin of the goods or services in respect of which they are used. In 
addition to their distinguishing function, trade marks have an advertising 
function. They play a pivotal role in a company&rsquo;s branding and marketing 
strategies, contributing to the definition of the image and reputation of the 
company&rsquo;s products in the eyes of consumers. The image and reputation of a 
company create trust, which is the basis for establishing a loyal clientele and 
enhancing a company&rsquo;s goodwill. Finally, they provide information about, 
amongst other things, the quality of the goods and services. Consumers need 
this information to make informed purchasing decisions. Trade marks provide 
an incentive for companies to invest in maintaining or improving the quality of 
their products to ensure that products bearing their trade mark have a positive 
reputation. Consumers who are satisfied with a product are likely to buy or use 
that product again.
</p>
<p>The trade mark system can help indigenous communities benefit from the 
branding of their TCEs, and protect their economic interests in those TCEs by 
allowing the registration of distinctive indigenous names, signs or symbols. 
Trade mark registration, combined with an appropriate marketing strategy, 
can enable indigenous communities to differentiate their products, and build 
a brand image and reputation. This can increase consumer recognition of TCEs 
and the commercial benefits for holders of TCEs, as the addition of a trade mark 
on a good increases its value. However, it should be noted that there are costs 
associated with the registration of a trade mark: for example, in relation to the 
registration and renewal fees, the enforcement of rights and the implementation 
of a marketing strategy.
</p>
<p>(b) Geographical Indications
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Geographical indications&rsquo; (GIs), as defined in Article 22(1) of the Agreement 
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) 
are indications23 which identify a good24 as originating25 in the territory of a 
</p>
<p>23 Under the TRIPS Agreement, a geographical indication is any &lsquo;indication&rsquo; pointing to a given country, 
region or locality. This differs from the definition of appellations of origin under the Lisbon Agreement, 
which provides that appellations of origin are necessarily &lsquo;geographical names&rsquo; of a country, region or locality. 
Although Article 22(1) does not provide what form indications can take, it is accepted that an indication is 
not expressly limited to the name of a place. A word or a phrase, for example, may serve as a GI without 
necessarily being the name of a territory and so may &lsquo;evoke&rsquo; the territory. For example, &lsquo;Basmati&rsquo; is known 
as an indication for rice coming from the Indian sub-continent, although it is not a place name as such. In 
addition, while a word may be an indication, other types of symbols, such as pictorial images, icons or emblems 
(for example, the symbol of the Eiffel Tower to designate French products) may also serve as identifiers. See 
UNCTAD&ndash;ICTSD, Resource Book on TRIPS and Development (Cambridge University Press, 2005) 289.
24 Whereas appellations of origin designate a product, the name of which is usually the same as the appellation 
of origin, it is well established that GIs, for the purpose of TRIPS, apply to any &lsquo;good&rsquo;, be it natural, agricultural, 
agri-industrial or manufactured, in respect of which an appropriate geographical link is made. See J Audier, TRIPS 
Agreement Geographical Indications (Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 2000) 16.
25 GIs identify a good &lsquo;originating&rsquo; in the territory of a member, or a region or locality in that territory. 
This should be understood as referring to goods that must be mined, grown or manufactured in that territory.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>156
</p>
<p>member, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation 
or other characteristic26 of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical 
origin.27 In other words, under the TRIPS definition, GIs communicate important 
information on: (a) the name of the product; (b) the area of geographical origin of 
the product; and (c) its given quality, reputation or other characteristics which 
are essentially attributable to that geographical origin.
</p>
<p>Article 22(2) of the TRIPS Agreement establishes the general standard of 
protection that must be available for all GIs. It provides that &lsquo;legal means&rsquo; must 
be provided to interested parties to prevent the use of GIs which mislead the 
public as to the geographical origin of the goods. It also requires that legal means 
be provided to prevent use which constitutes an &lsquo;act of unfair competition&rsquo; 
within the meaning of Article 10 bis of the Paris Convention. However, while 
it is mandatory for member states to provide protection to GIs, they are free 
to determine the appropriate method of protection when implementing the 
provisions of the Agreement within their own legal system and practice.28 Over 
the past decade, a variety of different legal concepts have been used to protect 
GIs at the national and regional levels. They include, in particular, laws of unfair 
competition and passing off, protected appellations of origin and registered GIs, 
collective and certification marks, and administrative schemes of protection.29 
The choice of a protection mechanism or a combination of systems of protection 
will usually depend on the legal tradition and historical and economic conditions 
of the jurisdiction concerned. However, the differences between these systems 
will have a bearing on important questions, such as conditions of protection, 
entitlement to use and scope of protection.
</p>
<p>26 Under TRIPS, &lsquo;quality, reputation or other characteristics&rsquo; of a good can each be a sufficient basis for 
eligibility as a GI, where they are &lsquo;essentially attributable&rsquo; to the geographical origin of the good in question. 
The word &lsquo;attributable&rsquo; seems to suggest an objective criterion. However, while this might be possible for 
a quality or characteristic, reputation suggests a subjective element. Indeed, the reference to quality refers 
to physical characteristics of the good. On the other hand, the reference to reputation makes clear that the 
identification of a particular objective attribute of the good is not a prerequisite to conferring protection. 
It is enough that the public associates a good with a territory because the public believes the good to have 
desirable characteristics. Indeed, GIs, like trade marks, may be built up through investment in advertising. 
The drawback is that the public may be deceived as to the quality of goods and their territorial link through 
false or misleading advertisement. See UNCTAD&ndash;ICTSD, above n 23, 290.
27 The words &lsquo;essentially attributable&rsquo; to the geographical territory are intended to establish the link 
between the product and the relevant territory. While a literal reading of &lsquo;territory&rsquo; would suggest that 
the link must be physical: that is, that the product must embody certain characteristics because of the soil 
conditions, weather or other physical elements in a place, the terms &lsquo;reputation&rsquo; and &lsquo;essentially attributable&rsquo; 
allow flexibility. Therefore, &lsquo;essentially attributable&rsquo; can be understood also to refer to human labour in the 
place or to goodwill created by advertisement in respect to the place. See UNCTAD&ndash;ICTSD, above n 23, 290-
291. This also seems to be confirmed by the drafting history of TRIPS. In the 1990 draft (Draft of 23 July 1990 
(W/76), para 2), the quality, reputation or other characteristic of the product had to be attributable to its 
geographical origin, including natural and human factors. The qualification &lsquo;natural and human factors&rsquo; did 
not, however, reappear in the final text of TRIPS, which uses the broader term of &lsquo;geographical origin&rsquo;. See 
D Gervais, The TRIPS Agreement, Drafting History and Analysis (2nd ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2003) 188-189.

<p>7. The Branding of Traditional Cultural Expressions: To Whose Benefit?
</p>
<p>157
</p>
<p>GIs have traditionally been associated with agricultural products, foodstuffs, 
wines and spirits. However, in recent years GIs have been said to be potentially 
useful in protecting indigenous knowledge. At the fifth session of the World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Intergovernmental Committee 
on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and 
Folklore (IGC), it was pointed out that some TCEs, such as handicrafts made 
using natural resources, may qualify as &lsquo;goods&rsquo; which could be protected by 
GIs.30
</p>
<p>TCEs can be tangible expressions in which culture is manifested or expressed, 
such as productions of art or handicrafts. They include, in particular, drawings, 
designs, paintings, carvings, sculptures, pottery, terracotta, mosaic, woodwork, 
metalware, jewellery, baskets, needlework, textiles, glassware, carpets, costumes 
and musical instruments. 
</p>
<p>These tangible expressions or &lsquo;handicrafts&rsquo; may qualify as goods which could be 
protected by GIs if they present the necessary qualities for GI protection.31 Such 
qualities would usually include a symbolic association between the handicraft 
or artisanal product and a particular culture which acknowledges the influence 
of tradition in its creation. Furthermore, these handicrafts would be produced 
either completely by hand or with the help of hand-tools or mechanical means, 
as long as the direct manual contribution of the craftsperson remains the most 
substantial component of the finished products. They would be produced 
using raw materials from sustainable resources, and their distinctive features 
could be utilitarian, aesthetic, artistic, creative, culturally attached, decorative, 
functional or traditional, or have a religious or social symbolism. Finally, the 
creative activity would occur within a small group or a community-based 
environment.32
</p>
<p>A number of common features can be identified between, on the one hand, GIs 
and the goods they relate to and, on the other, TCEs. They are (a) the communal 
element: while GIs identify a good that is produced by a number of different 
producers, TCEs are usually produced within a community; (b) the element 
of tradition: while GIs are often based on traditional formulae and processes, 
TCEs are produced according to traditional methods; (c) the element of time: the

</p>
<p>know-how attached to both GIs and TCEs is transmitted from one generation to 
the other; (d) the geographical link: while GIs are granted for products which 
have a relationship with the land, local resources or the environment, TCEs 
are generally linked to a specific place where a certain product is made, or to 
traditional methods or conditions used in a specific place for making a product, 
often using raw material from sustainable resources. In addition, while the value 
of a GI is linked to its origin, the value of TCEs is linked to the knowledge that 
a particular community from a particular region has produced it. 
</p>
<p>The GI system is therefore consistent with the nature of indigenous knowledge 
in that GIs work as a collective right and provide protection that is potentially 
unlimited in time, as long as the distinctive link between the goods and the 
place is maintained and the indication has not fallen into genericity. 
</p>
<p>There are many examples around the world of indigenous names, signs and 
symbols that have been registered as GIs. These include TALAVERA DE PUEBLA 
pottery and OLINAL&Aacute; handicrafts from Mexico; JABLONEC jewellery, glass 
and crystal from the Czech Republic; MADEIRA embroidery from Portugal; 
GORODETS paintings, ROSTOV enamel and KARGOPOL clay toys in the Russian 
Federation; and Mysore silk, Kashmir Pashmina and Pochampally Ikat in India.33
</p>
<p>While GIs do not directly protect the actual knowledge associated with TCEs, 
which remains in the public domain and is open to misappropriation, they can 
indirectly contribute to their protection in several ways. First, GIs protect the 
reputation or goodwill accumulated over time, and can safeguard a niche market 
segment. They can provide protection to TCEs against misleading and deceptive 
trading practices, and prevent third parties from using a protected GI on goods 
that do not originate from a given region and/or do not possess the requisite 
quality or characteristics. Secondly, GIs enable product differentiation. Where 
a product is successfully differentiated through the use of a GI, the market is 
segmented, and access to a specific market segment can be restricted to producers 
of products possessing the necessary quality, reputation or other characteristics, 
and who are carrying on their activity in the relevant geographical area. 
Thirdly, the registration of a GI can create value for the holders of TCEs and 
enhance the development of rural communities.34 For example, the registration 
of a GI has been shown to increase production output and land value, and the 
certainty afforded by legal protection can create opportunities for investment 
in a product and region. Fourthly, the registration of indigenous names, signs

<p>or symbols as GIs can help indigenous groups gain recognition for the cultural 
significance of their TCEs and preserve them for future generations. Finally, 
GIs provide information and educate consumers about the origin, quality and 
characteristics of the goods. 
</p>
<p>(c) Certification and Collective Marks
</p>
<p>Certification and collective marks are special types of marks. They inform 
the public about certain characteristics of the products or services marketed 
under the mark. Article 7 bis of the Paris Convention provides for the mutual 
obligation of registration and protection of collective marks in the countries 
of the Union.35 However, it leaves each country be the judge of the particular 
conditions under which a collective mark shall be protected, and provides that 
it may refuse protection if the mark is contrary to the public interest. Even 
though the Paris Convention refers only to collective marks, it is generally 
understood that the term also includes certification marks.36 Certification and 
collective marks can be indications of geographical origin. As such, they can 
be protected under the TRIPS Agreement. The TRIPS Agreement incorporates 
by reference a number of articles of the Paris Convention, including Article 7 
bis. As a consequence, collective marks which belong to associations and are 
serving as GIs are protected under TRIPS.37
</p>
<p>A certification mark is a mark which indicates that the goods or services in 
connection with which it is used are certified by the proprietor of the mark 
in respect of geographical origin, material, mode of manufacture of goods or 
performance of services, quality, accuracy, or other characteristics. In other 
words, it is an indication of the conformity of goods or services to particular 
standards, stipulated by the proprietor of the mark.
</p>
<p>35 As originally established in Paris in 1883, the Paris Convention made no provision for the protection 
of collective marks. However, at the Washington Conference of 1911, Article 7bis was introduced in the 
Convention. It was later amended at the London Conference of 1934. Article 7bis of the Paris Convention 
provides that: 
</p>
<p>The countries of the Union undertake to accept for filing and to protect collective marks belonging 
to associations the existence of which is not contrary to the law of the country of origin, even if such 
associations do not possess an industrial or commercial establishment.
</p>
<p>Each country shall be the judge of the particular conditions under which a collective mark shall be 
protected and may refuse protection if the mark is contrary to the public interest.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the protection of these marks shall not be refused to any association the existence of 
which is not contrary to the law of the country of origin, on the ground that such association is not 
established in the country where protection is sought or is not constituted according to the law of 
the latter country.

</p>
<p>Any person or entity that authorises traders to use a certification in relation 
to certain products or services may apply for a certification mark. However, 
the applicant must be considered competent to certify the products concerned. 
The owner of the certification mark is ultimately responsible for controlling 
its use and for ensuring that the mark is not used on non-compliant goods. 
The applicant must also supply a copy of the regulations governing the use 
of the certification mark, which must indicate who is authorised to use the 
mark, the characteristics to be certified by the mark, how the certifying body 
is to test those characteristics and supervise the use of the mark, the fees to 
be paid in connection with the administration of the certification scheme, and 
the procedures for resolving disputes. Unlike collective marks, certification 
marks are not confined to any membership. They can be used by anybody who 
complies with the standards defined by the owner of the certification mark.
</p>
<p>A collective mark is a mark which distinguishes the goods or services of 
members of an association which is the proprietor of the mark from those of 
other undertakings, without any requirement for certification of the goods 
or services. In most jurisdictions, applicants are required to supply a copy 
of the regulations governing the use of the collective mark. These generally 
indicate who is authorised to use the mark, the conditions of membership of 
the association, any conditions for use of the mark, as well as sanctions against 
misuse. The cost, duration and scope of protection applicable to collective 
marks are similar to those of ordinary trade marks. However, since the cost of 
registering a collective mark is divided among the members of the association, 
it becomes much cheaper for an individual member. This can be an attractive 
argument for indigenous and local communities for whom the cost of registering 
an ordinary trade mark to market their products or services could be dissuasive.
</p>
<p>An association of indigenous producers or craftspeople can register a collective 
mark and authorise its members to use it in relation to their products or services. 
In that way, a collective mark can be used as a tool to help them obtain consumer 
recognition and customer loyalty, and develop a joint marketing campaign for 
their products. Collective marks are often used to show membership of a union, 
association or other organisation. Membership as such may be an incentive to 
some customers to buy a product bearing the collective mark. In addition, a 
collective mark can have the function of informing the public about certain 
features of a product associated with it. Unlike certification marks, the proprietor 
association of a collective mark does not have to set standards to be met before </p>

</p>
<p>its members can use the mark. However, it may do so if it wishes. Consequently, 
collective marks may also perform a certification function.38 This is particularly 
relevant in countries that do not provide for registration of certification marks.39
</p>
<p>There are various examples, in a number of jurisdictions, of use of certification 
and collective marks to protect and promote TCEs. These have had varying 
levels of success. They include the toi ihotm certification mark in New Zealand,40 
the Alaska Silver Hand Program in Canada,41 and the Marca Colectiva FIEB42 
and the Aut&eacute;ntico Pemon43 certification marks in Venezuela, to name only a few.
</p>
<p>Certification and collective marks can be valuable tools for the protection and 
promotion of TCEs. They allow for collective use and can denote common 
</p>
<p>38 Note that there is a certain level of confusion between certification and collective marks. As Jeffrey 
Belson pointed out, during the first century of the registration system there was confusion over the respective 
roles of certification and collective marks, and this situation has not improved due to a proliferation and 
growing divergence of policy and law on certification and collective marks. For example, a mark may become 
a Community Trade Mark collective mark and a national domestically registered certification mark. Also, 
because there can be varying degrees of conflation, the usefulness and specificity of the information conveyed 
by a collective mark may at times be close to that of a traditional certification mark and at other times less so. 
See Belson, above n 37, 42-43.
39 As regards certification and collective marks, national laws for the registration of trade marks can be 
classified into three categories: (a) those which permit registration of certification marks only, in which case 
use of the marks is open to all who meet the standards; (b) those which permit registration of collective marks 
only, in which case collective marks may also perform a certification function. However, because they are 
registered as collective marks, their use is permitted only to members of the proprietor association, and (c) 
those which permit registration of both certification and collective marks. In this category also, collective 
marks may perform a certification function. See Dawson, above n 36.
40 Toi ihoTM is a registered certification trade mark used to promote and sell authentic, quality Māori 
arts and crafts, and to authenticate exhibitions and performances of Māori arts and artists. It is intended to 
certify that the arts and crafts are made by a person of Māori descent and to provide a mark of quality. It was 
developed and implemented in response to calls from Māori to assist them retain ownership and control of their 
taonga (treasures) and maintain the integrity of their art culture. While, overall, the introduction of the toi 
ihoTM mark has been beneficial to artists and consumers alike, the certification mark was disinvested in 2010. 
Some of the reasons for the disinvestment were that: (a) toi ihoTM no longer fitted in the strategic priorities 
of Creative New Zealand; (b) there was insufficient funding and resources to run the scheme appropriately; (c) 
the breadth of the scheme&rsquo;s design was too wide. Despite the disinvestment, artists have not been deregistered 
and the toi ihoTM scheme is currently in a transition phase. One possible plan for its future would be for a 
group of Māori artists to create a trust to take over the toi ihoTM mark. See Creative New Zealand, Statement 
on toi ihoTM (2009) &lt;http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/en/news/creative-new-zealand-statement-on-toi-iho&gt;
41 The Alaska Silver Hand Program is a certification mark that certifies the authenticity of Alaska Native art 
and guarantees consumers that items bearing the Silver Hand identification seal were handcrafted in Alaska 
by an Alaska Eskimo, Aleut, or Indian craftsperson or artist, and made wholly or in significant part of natural 
materials. See Alaska State Council on the Arts, Silver Hand Program and Permit Application &lt;http://www.
eed.state.ak.us/aksca/Forms/individuals/SH.pdf&gt;
42 The Marca Colectiva FIEB (Federation de Indigenas de Estado Bolivar) distinguishes goods and services 
manufactured or offered by indigenous people, associations or production centres affiliated to the Indigenous 
Federation of the Bolivar State. It demonstrates the material and spiritual bond between the goods and 
services manufactured or offered by the Bolivar State indigenous people, and the habitat and cultural 
background in which they have lived from ancestral times. See Grupo de Investigaci&oacute;n sobre, &lsquo;Politicas 
P&uacute;blicas de Propriedad Intelectual&rsquo; (Universidad de Los Andes, M&eacute;rida, Venezuela) &lt;http://www.cjp.ula.ve/

43 The Aut&eacute;ntico Pemon certification mark certifies and promotes indigenous handicrafts, indigenous 
artisans and the Pemon culture more generally. It includes the Aut&eacute;ntico Pemon certification mark, 
collaboration mark and certified merchandiser mark. See ibid.</p>

<p>indigenous origin. They do not confer a monopoly right, but they limit the class 
of people who can use a certain name, sign or symbol. The cost of registering 
and renewing a collective mark is divided among the members of the association 
and is consequently much cheaper than registering an ordinary trade mark. 
Similarly, marketing costs can also be shared by the members of the association. 
Finally, they provide protection that is potentially unlimited in time, provided 
the necessary steps are taken for their renewal.
</p>
<p>The registration of a certification or collective mark can help indigenous 
communities distinguish their TCEs, promote their art and artists nationally 
and internationally, and maintain the integrity of their culture. In addition, 
a certification or collective mark can be a valuable tool to help improve their 
economic position and ensure they get fair and equitable returns. Finally, these 
tools can be used by indigenous communities to raise public awareness and 
maximise consumer certainty as to the authenticity of the goods marketed 
under the mark. 
</p>
<p>Having said that, the effectiveness of a certification scheme depends on the way 
it is set up, implemented and policed. A successful certification scheme needs to 
gain the support of the stakeholders &mdash; that is, the indigenous communities &mdash; 
and the owner of the mark will need to engage in public education campaigns 
for the acceptance of the mark, so that the public, the relevant industry bodies 
and consumers become familiar with the characteristics that the certification 
scheme guarantees. Finally, where the certification or collective mark is also a 
quality mark, there needs to be an oversight of quality of the goods or services 
for which accreditation is sought.
</p>
<p>6. Concluding Comments
</p>
<p>The laws of trade marks, certification and collective marks, and GIs have not 
been designed, for the most part, with the protection of indigenous interests 
as an underlying policy goal. The utility of these laws as tools for holders of 
TCEs to protect their indigenous names, signs and symbols is therefore often 
coincidental.44 Although these legal tools may help them achieve some of their 
objectives, they will usually not provide a comprehensive system of protection. 
For example, as was highlighted above, even if the registration of a trade mark 
may prevent the registration of offensive and deceptive marks, it will not 
prevent the offensive and deceptive use of indigenous names, signs and symbols 
where the user does not seek to register a trade mark, and nor will it prevent

<p>the registration of indigenous names, signs and symbols by third parties 
where the signs are not considered offensive or deceptive. In the same way, 
the use of a certification mark or authenticity label will not, in itself, prevent 
the sale of imitation products in the marketplace. Further, when dealing with 
the protection and branding of TCEs, a distinction must be drawn between the 
protection of the actual knowledge and the protection of the indigenous names, 
signs and symbols associated with the TCEs. The systems of protection discussed 
above may protect the indigenous names, signs and symbols associated with the 
knowledge, but the actual knowledge is not protected, remains in the public 
domain and is open to misappropriation by third parties.
</p>
<p>Holders of TCEs should carefully plan how they will identify, protect and 
manage their IP assets. IP and marketing go hand in hand, so the use of IPRs to 
identify, authenticate, protect and exploit TCEs should form part of a planned 
and systematic marketing strategy. Similarly, IP assets are a basic requirement 
for a successful marketing strategy, as they can send messages about the product 
and help differentiate it from other products. </p>

<p>8. The Pacific Solution: The European 
Union&rsquo;s Intellectual Property Rights 
</p>
<p>Activism in Australia&rsquo;s and New 
Zealand&rsquo;s Sphere of Influence 
</p>
<p>Michael Blakeney
</p>
<p>1. Introduction
</p>
<p>This chapter describes the activities of the European Union (EU) in providing 
technical assistance to Pacific Island countries in relation to traditional knowledge 
(TK), and the implications for Australian and New Zealand development 
cooperation activities in what was hitherto regarded as their &lsquo;lake&rsquo;. Agriculture 
is the issue which has dominated Australia&rsquo;s and New Zealand&rsquo;s trade agenda, 
and intellectual property rights (IPRs), whether trade related or otherwise, are 
very much a subordinate issue. Both nations were foundation members of the 
Cairns Group of nineteen agricultural exporting countries which was formed in 
1986, at the time of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), to agitate for global agricultural trade reform. The Cairns Group 
has been forthright in criticising the European Community (EC), the United 
States and Japan as protecting their agricultural markets through a combination 
of high tariffs on agricultural imports and subsidies to their farm sectors. This 
condemns agricultural exporters in developing countries in Latin America, 
South East Asia and Oceania to &lsquo;the role of residual suppliers to their traditional 
markets&rsquo; and crowds them out of most other markets.1
</p>
<p>The 35th Cairns Group Ministerial Meeting at Punta del Este, Uruguay, from 19 
to 20 April 2010 conceded that the Doha Development Agenda must remain the 
top priority of World Trade Organization (WTO) members, but that the Cairns 
Group will continue to push for global trade reform in agriculture, which it 
perceived as critical to the development deliverables of the Uruguay Round.2 
In fact, the agriculture negotiations have been proceeding at a glacial pace and 
have not been assisted by the global financial crisis. An indication of Australia&rsquo;s

</p>
<p>ranking of negotiating priorities can be seen in its negotiation in 2007 of the 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States in which it was perceived as 
bargaining away IPRs for access to United States agricultural markets.3
</p>
<p>For the EU, on the other hand, the maintenance of agricultural protectionism 
does not seem to have abated, but it maintains a substantial IPRs agenda to 
underpin both its pharmaceutical and digital-based industries. Also, member 
states of the EU, such as France, Spain and Italy, have pioneered the use of 
geographical indications (GIs) to underpin agricultural niche markets. The EU 
played a significant role in having GIs included within the TRIPS Agreement. 
This inclusion was incomplete, as the articles concerned with GIs had a 
number of &lsquo;built-in agendas&rsquo; which envisaged further negotiations to finalise 
this subject. Thus, Article 24.2 required the TRIPS Council to conduct a 
review of the operation of the GIs provisions within the first two years of 
entry into force of the WTO Agreement. Article 23.4 provided that &lsquo;in order 
to facilitate the protection of geographical indications for wines, negotiations 
shall be undertaken in the Council for TRIPS concerning the establishment of a 
multilateral system of notification and registration of geographical indications 
for wines eligible for protection in those Members participating in the system&rsquo;, 
and under Article 24.1 members agreed &lsquo;to enter into negotiations aimed at 
increasing the protection of individual geographical indications under Article 
23&rsquo;. The EU, together with Switzerland, has played an active role in pressing for 
an expansion of the scope of the GIs provisions of TRIPS. Australia and New 
Zealand, on the other hand, have been active opponents of this expansion.
</p>
<p>The EU has also pursued its GIs agenda outside the TRIPS Council. In February 
2003, the EC proposed to the WTO&rsquo;s Committee on Agriculture that it &lsquo;claw 
back&rsquo; certain GIs which were being &lsquo;used by producers other than the right-
holders in the country of origin&rsquo;.4 The EC&rsquo;s approach to GIs in the context 
of the agriculture negotiations is complementary to the TRIPS negotiations. 
The EC explained that its objective was to negotiate &lsquo;specific commitments in 
order to guarantee fair market access opportunities for those wines, spirits and 
other agricultural and food-stuff products whose quality, reputation or other 
characteristics are essentially attributable to their geographical origin and 
traditional know-how&rsquo;.5 As a follow-up to this proposal, in September 2003 a 
preliminary list of products (wines, spirits, cheeses and ham) which fell into this 
category was notified to the Committee.6 The claw-back proposal was strongly 
opposed by the same countries that were opposed to GIs extension in the TRIPS

</p>
<p>Council. The EC sought to allay concerns by referring to the &lsquo;grand-fathering&rsquo; 
clause of Article 24.4, which would allow the use of protected GIs by producers 
in third countries, providing that they have done so for more than ten years 
prior to the signing of an amendment.7
</p>
<p>Within the Committee on Agriculture the view has been strongly pressed that GIs 
protection is a matter for the TRIPS Council because the agriculture negotiations 
focus on food products, whereas proposed negotiations under TRIPS would 
cover all products including agricultural products and handicrafts.8 Certainly 
the WTO documents concerning the negotiations on agriculture over the past 
five years make no reference to GIs.
</p>
<p>In urging their respective positions, both the EU and its antipodean opponents 
have sought to enlist third countries, particularly those in the large bloc of 
developing and least developed countries (LDCs), to their cause. However, as 
this chapter indicates, in the Pacific this rivalry has been played out in the field 
of traditional knowledge (TK) protection, which is perceived by Pacific Island 
countries as closer to their national interests.
</p>
<p>2. The Pacific Islands Perspective
</p>
<p>The Pacific Islands Forum9 is the key regional political organisation in the 
Pacific. Its annual meetings have mainly focused on regional trade and economic 
issues. The foundation members were: Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, 
New Zealand, Tonga and Western Samoa. They have since been joined by Niue, 
Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, the Republic 
of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau. New 
Caledonia and French Polynesia were granted associate membership in 2006. 
Current Forum observers include: Tokelau, Wallis and Futuna, American Samoa, 
Guam and the Commonwealth of Northern Marianas; Timor Leste has special 
observer status. 
</p>
<p>The 40th Forum, held in Cairns in August 2011, issued the Cairns Communiqu&eacute;, 
which included the Cairns Compact on Strengthening Development Coordination 
in the Pacific; a Call to Action on Climate Change, in advance of Copenhagen; 
agreement to commence negotiations on a new regional trade and economic 
agreement; and the hosting of meetings to strengthen protection and management

</p>
<p>of regional fisheries resources, and to improve energy security.10  The subsequent 
Forum, in Auckland, New Zealand, in September 2011 reaffirmed strong support 
for the Cairns Compact on Strengthening Development Coordination.
</p>
<p>The Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) is an umbrella 
agreement between the Pacific Islands members of the Pacific Islands Forum and 
Australia and New Zealand. The agreement which was signed at Nauru on 18 
August 2001, entering into force on 3 October 2002, established a framework for 
the future development of trade and economic relations across the Forum region 
as a whole. It envisaged a staged process of trade liberalisation, commencing with 
a free trade agreement in goods &mdash; the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement 
&mdash; among Pacific Island countries. Among other things, PACER provides for 
technical assistance to the Island country members in anticipation of future 
negotiations on a Forum-wide reciprocal free trade agreement (PACER-Plus). 
An underlying concern of the Forum Island countries is that the PACER-Plus 
agreement is being &lsquo;forced on them&rsquo; by the currently dominant regional powers, 
Australia and New Zealand.11 The Forum Island countries have fought to have 
established as an independent body the Office of the Chief Trade Adviser (OCTA) 
to provide advice and support for the negotiation of PACER-Plus. Australia and 
New Zealand have apparently sought to use their contribution to the funding of 
the OCTA to restrict the activities of that office.12 The tension between Australia 
and New Zealand on the one hand and the Forum Island states on the other 
has created an opportunity of influence for the EU, which has announced its 
intention of negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the 
Pacific Island states.13
</p>
<p>In July 2009, Papua New Guinea signed an interim EPA, followed by Fiji 
in December 2009. The situation of Fiji has also provided the EU with an 
opportunity to involve itself in Pacific affairs. On 2 May 2009, Fiji was suspended 
indefinitely from participation in the Pacific Forum because of the deteriorating 
human rights situation in the country. It remains outside the Pacific Forum. As 
one response, Fiji became the principal organiser of the Melanesian Spearhead 
Group (MSG), comprising Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and 
the Front de Lib&eacute;ration Nationale Kanak et Socialiste of New Caledonia. 
The MSG had been founded as a political gathering in 1983, but became an

<p>8. The Pacific Solution
</p>
<p>169
</p>
<p>international organisation on 23 March 2007. MSG members are the signatories 
of a preferential trade agreement between them. On the occasion of the 40th 
anniversary of the Pacific Islands Forum in September 2011, Fiji&rsquo;s military ruler, 
Frank Bainimarama, took the opportunity to organise a meeting with a number 
of Pacific Island states in Nadi. It was attended by the prime ministers of Papua 
New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, as well as the foreign ministers of 
Nauru and Timor Leste.14
</p>
<p>The exclusion of Fiji from the Pacific Islands Forum has caused Fiji and MSG 
members to look to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China to fund the construction of a 
Secretariat building in Vanuatu. And, as is mentioned below, the EU provided 
technical assistance to the MSG to allow it to promulgate in 2011 a collaborative 
agreement providing for the protection of TK and expressions of culture. 
</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that an assumption of the Pacific development 
cooperation programmes of the EU and of Australia and New Zealand is that 
WTO membership is a desirable objective for Pacific Island states. However, 
some of those states have begun to question whether this is indeed in their 
best interests. Vanuatu, which completed its WTO accession process in 2001, 
has been reported to have &lsquo;put it on hold&rsquo; because of the wide- ranging trade 
concessions it was required to make.15 Similarly, Samoa and Tonga are reported 
to be deterred by the trade concessions which they have been obliged to offer.16 
The EU initiatives in relation to TK and GIs, underpinned by its EPAs, can be 
seen as an attempt to demonstrate the advantages of WTO engagement for the 
Pacific Island states.
</p>
<p>3. An International TK Instrument
</p>
<p>The Pacific region has been a global pioneer of initiatives for the protection of 
TK. The first regional instrument dealing with the protection of TK was the 
Suva Declaration which was issued by the Regional Consultation on Indigenous 
Peoples&rsquo; Knowledge and Intellectual Property Rights, held in April 1995. The 
declarants committed themselves to raising public awareness of the dangers 
of expropriation of indigenous knowledge and resources; encouraging chiefs, 
elders and community leaders to play a leadership role in the protection 
of indigenous peoples&rsquo; knowledge and resources; and to incorporating the 
concerns of indigenous peoples to protect their knowledge and resources in

<p>legislation by including &lsquo;Prior Informed Consent or No Informed Consent&rsquo; 
(PICNIC) procedures, and excluding the patenting of life forms.17 The Suva 
Declaration called for the initiation of a treaty &lsquo;declaring the Pacific Region to 
be a life forms patent-free zone&rsquo; and for a moratorium on bioprospecting in the 
Pacific until appropriate protection mechanisms were in place. The final article 
of the Declaration called on France &lsquo;to stop definitively its nuclear testing in the 
Pacific and repair the damaged biodiversity&rsquo;.18
</p>
<p>Responding to a number of indigenous persons&rsquo; declarations calling for the 
protection of TK which had followed the Rio Earth Summit in 1992,19 the World 
Forum on the Protection of Folklore was convened by the World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO) and UNESCO in February 1996 in Phuket, 
Thailand, to explore issues concerning the preservation and protection of 
expressions of folklore. At that meeting the representatives of organisations of 
indigenous peoples called for the promulgation of an international convention to 
protect TK. In response, WIPO in its 1998&ndash;99 biennium instituted a schedule of 
regional fact-finding missions &lsquo;to identify and explore the intellectual property 
needs, rights and expectations of the holders of traditional knowledge and 
innovations, in order to promote the contribution of the intellectual property 
system to their social, cultural and economic development&rsquo;.20
</p>
<p>In a Note dated 14 September 2000, the Permanent Mission of the Dominican 
Republic to the United Nations in Geneva submitted two documents on behalf 
of the Group of Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean calling for the 
creation of a Standing Committee on access to the genetic resources and TK 
of local and indigenous communities. &lsquo;The work of that Standing Committee 
would have to be directed towards defining internationally recognized practical 
methods of securing adequate protection for the intellectual property rights 
in traditional knowledge.&rsquo;21 In 2000, WIPO established an Intergovernmental 
Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional 
Knowledge and Folklore (IGC). At its first session, held in Geneva from 30 April 
to 3 May 2001, IGC member states determined the agenda of items on which 
work should proceed, and prioritised certain tasks. Principal among these 
was &lsquo;the development of &ldquo;guide contractual practices,&rdquo; guidelines, and model 
intellectual property clauses for contractual agreements on access to genetic 
resources and benefit-sharing&rsquo;.22 This soft law approach to the protection of TK

<p>8. The Pacific Solution
</p>
<p>171
</p>
<p>continued for a number of years. In August 2004, the IGC began to consider 
the &lsquo;objectives&rsquo; and &lsquo;principles&rsquo; which should animate the protection of TK,23 
and this task has continued through all the subsequent sessions of the IGC.24 
A brief palpitation of enthusiasm on the international front was generated in 
October 2010, when the IGC identified its upcoming 17th session, to be held 
from 6 to10 December 2010, as the occasion for the first text-based discussion 
of the establishment of an international TK regime. The results of this session 
were not so exciting. An &lsquo;informal drafting group&rsquo; was set up to provide a 
text on traditional cultural expressions (TCEs) for the next meeting of the IGC 
scheduled for 9 to13 May 2011.25
</p>
<p>In relation to TK, matters were not as far advanced. An intersessional working 
group met from 21 to 25 February 2011 to discuss the latest draft of the Revised 
Objectives and Principles on TK. The report prepared by the working group 
for the May 2011 meeting of the IGC explained that &lsquo;the draft articles and 
comments, including specific texts suggested by experts, were noted ... and not 
adopted as such&rsquo;.26
</p>
<p>4. Pacific Regional TK Initiatives
</p>
<p>Two early Pacific initiatives for the protection of TK were: the 2001 Model 
Law on Traditional Biological Resources, Innovations and Practices, developed 
by the Pacific Islands Forum;27 and the Model Law on Traditional Knowledge 
and Expressions of Culture (TKEC), completed in 2002 and subsequently 
endorsed by the Pacific Community Ministers for Culture of the Secretariat 
of the Pacific Community (SPC) for adoption by member countries.28 Despite 
their promulgation, neither of these instruments was implemented by national 
legislation. Apparently, the Pacific Island countries were urged by Australia and 
New Zealand to await international developments at WIPO.
</p>
<p>The slow pace of these developments caused the Anglophone African countries 
at a diplomatic conference organised by the African Regional Intellectual

&lsquo;to better reflect the geographic location of its members in the north and south Pacific&rsquo;. Its members were: 
Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua 
New Guinea, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

</p>
<p>Property Organization (ARIPO) on 9 and 10 August 2010 in Swakopmund, 
Namibia, to promulgate a Protocol on the Protection of Traditional Knowledge 
and Expressions of Folklore. The Protocol is meant to &lsquo;protect creations derived 
from the exploitation of traditional knowledge in ARIPO member states against 
misappropriation and illicit use through bio-piracy&rsquo;.29 The African group of 
countries at WIPO have been in the forefront of agitation there to accelerate 
international negotiations for a TK instrument. The Swakopmund Declaration 
can be regarded as either a reflection of their appreciation of the realistic 
likelihood of an international solution or a means of accelerating the pace of 
developments at WIPO.
</p>
<p>In March 2007, at a high-level meeting of the executives of the Pacific 
Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) and the SPC, it was decided that lead agency 
responsibility relating to the Model Law would move from the SPC to the PIFS. 
As a first step, the PIFS convened a workshop in June 2007 to determine member 
countries&rsquo; technical assistance needs with regard to progressing the Model Law&rsquo;s 
implementation at the national level. The conclusions and recommendations of 
that workshop were subsequently endorsed by Forum trade ministers in August 
2007. A Traditional Knowledge Implementation Action Plan (&lsquo;Action Plan&rsquo;) was, 
in part, a response to member countries&rsquo; requests for technical assistance as 
conveyed to the PIFS at the workshop. Its overall objective was to assist the 
Forum Island countries in their efforts to establish a regional infrastructure for 
TK that would consist of a mutual recognition and enforcement regime founded 
on uniform national legal systems of protection. As a first step, the Action Plan 
would assist the Forum Island countries to develop policy and draft legislation 
based on the Model Law on TKEC and the Model Law on Traditional Biological 
Resources framework. Then, as a second step, a regional system of TK protection 
would be developed. 
</p>
<p>The Action Plan was developed with the technical assistance of the TradeCom 
Facility of the EU. Two EU projects were implemented as part of a broad 
programme of technical assistance. The first project provided technical 
assistance for the establishment of national systems of protection for TK in six 
of the member states of the Pacific Islands Forum, namely the Cook Islands, 
Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu.30 The terms of reference 
for the second project, concerning the formulation of a treaty for the reciprocal 
recognition of TK among the Melanesian Spearhead Group of countries (Fiji, 
Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu), recognised that

</p>
<p>... a global treaty for TK governance at international fora such as WIPO 
</p>
<p>...would present the best possible answer to the problem. However 
those processes are evolving slowly and are fraught with the political 
and diplomatic complexities of international negotiations. Running 
in parallel, a viable and faster alternative ... would be to consider 
reciprocal arrangements for recognition and enforcement between the 
MSG members ... While the focus for the MSG Secretariat at this time is 
clearly its own members, the MSG recognizes that ultimately the issue 
at hand is a global one and any future collective arrangement would not 
preclude other countries from the wider Pacific region to participate 
in the system. These developments would instruct and inform global 
treaty making processes currently taking place in institutions such as 
WIPO and possibly lead to engagement with other like-minded regions 
given the slow movements to conclude a global regime for TK at WIPO, 
WTO and CBD.31
</p>
<p>5. Australian, New Zealand and EU Negotiating 
Positions on TK
</p>
<p>The Pacific Island countries resort to EU assistance in relation to their TK 
protection agenda may derive from the respective negotiating positions of the 
EU, Australia and New Zealand in the various international fora considering this 
subject. Australia and New Zealand were two of only four countries (together 
with Canada and the United States) which originally voted against the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) which was 
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 13 September 2007. 
Some 143 member states voted in favour of UNDRIP, a non-binding text which 
sets out the rights of indigenous peoples to &lsquo;maintain and strengthen their 
own institutions, cultures and traditions, and to pursue their development in 
keeping with their own needs and aspirations&rsquo;. Article 31 of UNDRIP recognises 
the rights of indigenous peoples to maintain, control, protect and develop their 
intellectual property over their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and 
traditional cultural expressions. The opposition of Australia and New Zealand, 
Canada and the United States attracted considerable opprobrium and could 
not have been very encouraging for the Pacific Island countries pursuing an 
international TK regime.

</p>
<p>Senator Marise Payne explained in a speech in the Australian Senate on 10 
September 2007 the various reasons for the Australian Government&rsquo;s opposition 
to UNDRIP. She explained that &lsquo;as our laws here currently stand, we protect 
our Indigenous cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural 
expression to an extent that is consistent with both Australian and international 
intellectual property law, and we are not prepared to go as far as the provisions 
in the text of the draft declaration currently do on that matter&rsquo;.32 In other 
words, Senator Payne seemed to indicate that the Australian Government was 
opposed to any sui generis protection of TK. She also indicated the Australian 
Government&rsquo;s opposition to &lsquo;the inclusion in the text of an unqualified right of 
free, prior and informed consent for indigenous peoples on matters affecting 
them&rsquo; because the text did &lsquo;not acknowledge the rights of third parties &mdash; in 
particular, their rights to access indigenous land and heritage and cultural 
objects where appropriate under national law&rsquo;.33
</p>
<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s Māori Affairs minister, Parekura Horomia, was reported as 
criticising UNDRIP as little more than a wish list.34 On the other hand, the 
country&rsquo;s Māori Party co-leader Tariana Turia was very critical of the New 
Zealand Government&rsquo;s position in opposing a Declaration which promotes 
&lsquo;merely a minimum standard of human rights for Māori&rsquo;.35
</p>
<p>With the change of government in Australia, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd 
announced on 3 April 2009 Australian support for the Declaration.36 New 
Zealand followed suit on 19 April 2010, also after a change of government.37
</p>
<p>Within WIPO, the 18th session of the IGC met from 9 to 13 May 2011 in 
Geneva to consider the latest draft of the Revised Objectives and Principles 
for the Protection of Traditional Knowledge.38 Some perspective on the current 
negotiating positions of Australia and New Zealand can be gleaned from 
delegations&rsquo; submissions on this document.
</p>
<p>The Australian delegation considered that, without prejudice to any position 
on particular elements, the Objectives and Principles in Parts I and II should 
support and provide guidance to any suggested working text on the substantive

</p>
<p>provisions contained in Part III.39 It noted that &lsquo;the lack of agreement or 
consensus on elements of the Objectives and Principles made discussion of Part 
III very difficult&rsquo;.40 Specifically:
</p>
<p>With respect to part III, in general, it noted that references to &lsquo;Articles&rsquo; 
resembled draft treaty text and pre-empt discussion about the form 
and status of any international legal instrument which would ensure 
the protection of TK. It noted the lack of consensus on the need for a 
legally binding instrument, and called for further general discussion 
at an appropriate time on the adoption of prescriptive principles that 
focused on conferring legally enforceable rights in light of the core 
General Guiding Principle (g) &lsquo;respect for and cooperation with other 
international and regional instruments and processes&rsquo;.41
</p>
<p>This negotiating position would seem to be out of sympathy with the aspirations 
of the Pacific Island countries for a legally enforceable international TK regime. 
</p>
<p>The New Zealand delegation, together with those of Japan and Switzerland, 
suggested that &lsquo;in-depth examination of policy objectives and principles was 
the prerequisite for the discussion on the substantive provisions&rsquo;.42
</p>
<p>The submission of the delegation of the EU and its member states indicates a 
more sympathetic position. It suggested that the Policy Objectives &lsquo;had become 
overly long, detailed and complicated&rsquo;, and expressed the view that &lsquo;the aim 
of the objectives should be to set out an overarching statement of what the 
Committee thought this instrument should do and not how it should be done&rsquo;.43 
It agreed that there was a need to find a proper balance between the holders of 
TK and users in society at large, but that the proposed Objectives, Principles 
and substantive articles &lsquo;needed to respect the existing international regimes 
and in particular the IP regime&rsquo;.44 Finally, the delegation was of the opinion that 
the eventual protection of TK could not prevail in any way over the existing 
conventional IP regimes.45 This final submission will raise problems for those 
who consider that TK has a human rights content.46 Resolution 2000/7 of the 
United Nations Sub-Commission on Human Rights in Article 3 reminds all 
governments &lsquo;of the primacy of human rights obligations over economic policies 
and agreements&rsquo;. Governments are requested in Article 6 to integrate into their

<p>national and local legislations and policies &lsquo;provisions, in accordance with 
international human rights obligations and principles that protect the social 
function of intellectual property&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand, together with Canada, Norway and the United 
States, have taken a lead at the IGC in proposing in May 2010 the objectives, 
principles and substantive provisions for international legislation which might 
be promulgated on the protection of genetic resources.47 The IGC adopted this 
as a working draft and invited comments on it from other delegations. Chile&rsquo;s 
and Colombia&rsquo;s comments from the perspective of developing countries were 
that the proposals lacked both specificity and the crucial obligation of sharing 
benefits from the utilisation of others&rsquo; genetic resources.48
</p>
<p>In 2002, the EU had submitted to the TRIPS Council that the disclosure of origin 
of genetic resources involved in patent applications should be a mandatory 
obligation.49 This was reiterated by the EU in May 2005 in its submission 
to the IGC on the &lsquo;Disclosure of Origin or Source of Genetic Resources and 
Associated Traditional Knowledge in Patent Applications&rsquo;. It argued that &lsquo;there 
are good reasons for an obligation to disclose that an invention is directly based 
on traditional knowledge associated with the use of genetic resources&rsquo;.50 The 
African group of countries endorsed this EU proposal in its response to the 
Australia/New Zealand May 2010 submission to the IGC.51 The African group 
also proposed the principle that IPRs and obligations be clarified &lsquo;with respect 
to the protection of traditional knowledge, genetic resources and traditional 
cultural expressions and certainty and clarity for prior informed consent and 
fair and equitable benefit sharing&rsquo;.52
</p>
<p>In general it would seem that the negotiating positions taken by the EU on TK 
and genetic resources are closer to the interests of the Pacific Island countries 
than those taken by Australia and New Zealand. The EU does not have the 
complication of significant indigenous populations, such as the Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander peoples or Māori, who are calling for the protection of 
their TK.

</p>
<p>6. EU Technical Assistance
</p>
<p>The Pacific Island states are among the beneficiaries of the Partnership Agreement 
(&lsquo;Cotonou Agreement&rsquo;) between the members of the African, Caribbean and 
Pacific (ACP) group of states and the EU, signed 23 June 2000 and concluded 
for a twenty-year period from March 2000 to February 2020. Article 46 of the 
Cotonou Agreement recognises the need for parties &lsquo;to ensure an adequate and 
effective level of protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property 
rights, and other rights covered by TRIPS including protection of geographical 
indications&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>During 2010, the EU executed two IPR technical assistance projects in the 
Pacific. The first, entitled &lsquo;Technical Assistance to the Pacific Regional Action 
Plan for Traditional Knowledge Development&rsquo;, had as its specific objective the 
provision of technical assistance for the establishment of national systems of 
protection for TK and EC in six of the member states of the Pacific Islands Forum, 
namely the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu.53 
A second project provided technical assistance to study the &lsquo;Feasibility of a 
Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement Mechanism&rsquo; for TK expressions of 
culture between Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands: the so-called 
MSG countries.54
</p>
<p>Under the first project, national mapping of TK and EC was conducted in the 
target states; draft IPR laws and policies have been formulated for Fiji, Papua 
New Guinea and the Solomon Islands; and a collaboration treaty was drafted for 
the MSG states.55 The treaty was submitted to the 18th Melanesian Spearhead 
Group Leaders&rsquo; Summit in Suva on 31 March 2011, which &lsquo;agreed in principle 
pending decisions by members on the signing of the Treaty&rsquo;.56 The treaty was 
signed by the Governments of Fiji and the Solomon Islands in September 2011.57 
The Governments of Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu are currently undertaking 
in-country consultations on the treaty before signing it.
</p>
<p>The two EU projects concerned with TK were initiated as part of its assistance 
to be provided under the Cotonou Agreement, but interestingly TK is not a 
category of IPRs mentioned in the TRIPS Agreement. Another interesting 
feature of Article 46 of the Cotonou Agreement is that the only category of IPRs

<p>specifically mentioned is geographical indications (GIs). This is a category close 
to the heart of EU IPR interests, although it is something of a novelty for the 
Pacific Island countries. Given that the EU has not typically negotiated strongly 
for the protection of TK, its technical assistance to the Pacific Island countries 
in relation to TK might be regarded as the EU&rsquo;s price for garnering their support 
for its GIs agenda.
</p>
<p>Resort to technical assistance from the EU in relation to TK is also explained in 
part by the slowness of developments in this area at WIPO, and by the perceived 
lack of enthusiasm for this subject on the part of Australia and New Zealand, 
countries which have traditionally provided technical legal assistance to Pacific 
Island countries.
</p>
<p>7. International Negotiations on Geographical 
Indications and the EU&rsquo;s Agenda
</p>
<p>Much closer to the interests of the EU are the WTO negotiations on GIs. Article 
24.2 of the TRIPS Agreement requires the TRIPS Council to conduct a review 
of the operation of the GIs provisions within the first two years of entry into 
force of the WTO Agreement. The Council confined its initial review to the 
question of a multilateral register of geographical wine indications, as Article 
23.4 provided that &lsquo;negotiations shall be undertaken in the Council for TRIPS 
concerning the establishment of a multilateral system of notification and 
registration of geographical indications for wines eligible for protection in those 
Members participating in the system&rsquo;. Prior to the Ministerial Conference of 
the WTO held in Seattle in November 1999, a submission by Turkey proposed 
the extension of the multilateral register beyond wines and spirits.58 This was 
endorsed by the African group of countries which requested that the protection 
of GIs be extended &lsquo;to other products recognizable by their geographical origins 
(handicrafts, agro-food products)&rsquo;.59 This proposal was also taken up by Cuba, 
the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, India, Indonesia, 
Nicaragua, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Uganda and Venezuela. A proposal from Bulgaria, 
the Czech Republic, Egypt, Iceland, India, Kenya, Liechtenstein, Pakistan, 
Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Switzerland and Turkey was that the special protection 
for GIs in Article 23 be extended to products other than wines and spirits.60

<p>and spirits under TRIPS to all products, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, 
Guatemala, New Zealand, Paraguay and the United States sent a communication 
to the TRIPS Council on 29 June 2001.61 It pointed out that proposals had 
insufficiently addressed the costs and administrative burdens of this extension. 
However, Clause 18 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration 2001 included within 
the negotiating subjects of the Round the establishment of a multilateral register 
for wines and spirits, as well as the extension of GI protection beyond wines 
and spirits as part of the Doha Development Agenda.62 As will be seen below, 
both sets of negotiations have proceeded without any perceivable progress. It is 
in this context that the EU has looked to enlist the support of the Pacific Island 
states for its negotiating positions.
</p>
<p>In June 2005, the EC submitted a proposal to amend the TRIPS Agreement to 
provide global protection for GIs in a multilateral system of registration.63 This 
proposal sought to bring international protection for GIs into conformity with 
the EU, where a Community-wide system for their registration is considered an 
indispensable part of agricultural policy, serving both to preserve the incomes 
of small to medium-size producers and to guarantee the sustainability of the 
rural economy. Given that it possesses over 700 registered GIs,64 a sophisticated 
institutional infrastructure and technical prowess, the EU is exceptionally 
well placed to leverage the benefits of an expanded international system of 
GI protection. On the other hand, the United States and its supporters largely 
endorse the status quo, favouring voluntary multilateral registration and the 
choice of the means of protection &mdash; whether by special system or the established 
trade mark system &mdash; left to national discretion.

a view to completing the work started in the Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property

a multilateral system of notification and registration of geographical indications for wines and spirits by the 
Fifth Session of the Ministerial Conference. We note that issues related to the extension of the protection of 
geographical indications provided for in Article 23 to products other than wines and spirits will be addressed 
in the Council for TRIPS pursuant to paragraph 12 of this Declaration.&rsquo; 
63 The EC proposed amending Section 3 of the TRIPS Agreement with a view to extending the regime of 
protection today available for GIs on wines and spirits to GIs on all products (&lsquo;extension&rsquo;) and, in addition, a 
proposal for the inclusion of an annex to the TRIPS Agreement establishing a multilateral system of notification

<p>The EC submission set out provisions for a centralised register that would be 
compulsory and have legal effect.65 The EC proposal was aimed at preserving 
each WTO member&rsquo;s prerogative to determine whether a certain sign, indication 
or geographical name does indeed meet the TRIPS definition of a GI.66
</p>
<p>Opponents of the EC proposal &mdash; Australia, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, 
Ecuador, El Salvador, New Zealand and the US &mdash; took the position that the 
international protection of GIs is adequate as it stands, and that such a drastic 
development would serve only to undermine future gains in market access for 
non-European food and agricultural products.67 Concern was also expressed 
about the additional costs and administrative burdens of implementing a 
distinct system of GI protection in addition to the TRIPS obligations. These 
countries advocated a system of voluntary notification and registration, with no 
obligation to protect registered GIs. A revised communication from Argentina, 
Australia, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, 
El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, 
Nicaragua, Paraguay, Chinese Taipei, South Africa and the US proposed that the 
TRIPS Council should set up a voluntary system whereby notified GIs would 
be registered in a database. Those governments choosing to participate in the 
system would have to consult the database when taking decisions on protection 
in their own countries. Non-participating members would be &lsquo;encouraged&rsquo; but 
&lsquo;not obliged&rsquo; to consult the database.68
</p>
<p>Hong Kong, China proposed a compromise under which a registered term would 
enjoy a more limited &lsquo;presumption&rsquo; than under the EU proposal, and only in 
those countries choosing to participate in the system.69
</p>
<p>In July 2008, a group of WTO members called for a &lsquo;procedural decision&rsquo; to 
negotiate three intellectual property issues in parallel: these two GI issues 
and a proposal to require patent applicants to disclose the origin of genetic 
resources or TK used in their inventions.70 WTO members remain divided over

<p>8. The Pacific Solution
</p>
<p>181
</p>
<p>the proposal to negotiate the three subjects in parallel, with opponents arguing 
that the only mandate for the TRIPS Council is to negotiate the multilateral 
register. Under the chairmanship of Ambassador Trevor C. Clarke (Barbados) 
during 2008 and 2009, the Special Session of the TRIPS Council considered the 
various proposals, and the chairman identified as &lsquo;crucial&rsquo; the two issues of 
participation and consequences or legal effects of registration.71
</p>
<p>With respect to the issue of whether participation in the system should be 
voluntary or mandatory, some WTO members interpreted the mandate&rsquo;s 
reference to &lsquo;a multilateral system&rsquo; to mean that the system should apply to all 
members. Other members argued that the words &lsquo;those Members participating in 
the system&rsquo; mean that not all members are expected to participate. Ambassador 
Clarke encouraged members &lsquo;to continue searching for an acceptable solution 
that would determine a participation of Members in the Register that renders it 
a useful and meaningful tool in line with its purpose to facilitate protection&rsquo;.72 
With respect to the consequences or legal effects of registration, all members 
seem to accept an obligation to consult the information on the register and to 
take that information into account when making decisions regarding registration 
and protection of trade marks and GIs under their national procedures. 
However, views differ significantly as to how such information should be taken 
into account, what weight and significance should be given to it, and whether 
there should be a specific legal obligation to take the information into account. 
</p>
<p>Ambassador Clarke&rsquo;s successor as chairman of the Special Session of the Council 
for TRIPS, Ambassador Darlington Mwape (Zambia), announced upon assuming 
office that the specific negotiating mandate of the Special Session was limited 
to the negotiation of a register of GIs for wines and spirits.73 Ambassador 
Mwape circulated a work programme suggesting a list of &lsquo;Possible Elements for 
Developing Texts&rsquo; for the future register.74 Applying this structure, a drafting 
group developed a single draft composite text on the register.75 Ambassador 
Mwape reported that despite the fact that this text reflects both the current state 
of negotiations in the group and significant progress, views differed on whether 
it could be forwarded to the Trade Negotiations Committee by Easter 2011, the 
deadline set by the Director-General of the WTO for the conclusion of the Doha 
Round of negotiations.76

</p>
<p>Ambassador Mwape explained: 
</p>
<p>I have made strenuous attempts to resolve this and have offered to use 
my prerogative as Chair to improve textual compliance with the Special 
Session of the Council for TRIPS mandate. However, Members have 
been unable to engage constructively on this question and have instead 
insisted that the purely bottom-up and Member-driven nature of the 
text be scrupulously respected at this time.77
</p>
<p>His frustration would have been shared by the EU, given its desire to settle the 
issue of the multilateral register for its wines.
</p>
<p>In view of the global markets at stake in the agricultural and food-processing 
sectors, the United States and Australia became so concerned at the systematic 
discrimination its trade mark owners faced in enforcing their rights against 
European-registered GIs that it invoked the WTO dispute settlement procedure. 
On 18 August 2003, the United States and Australia had requested the 
establishment of a WTO dispute settlement panel to review the consistency of 
the EU Regulation 2081/92 with the rules of the TRIPS and GATT Agreements.78 
The US and Australia argued that the EU scheme for the protection of GIs failed 
to comply with TRIPS, principally because it was discriminatory in imposing 
additional registration obligations on non-EU nationals, and thus was in 
violation of the national treatment obligation which requires countries to treat 
foreigners in the same way as locals are treated. 
</p>
<p>The Panel Report in the dispute decided in favour of the US and Australia in 
relation to the national treatment argument.79 It recommended that the EU bring 
its regulation into conformity with the TRIPS Agreement by eliminating the 
additional registration requirements for foreigners. The EU Regulation was 
repealed and replaced by Council Regulation (CE) 510/2006 on the protection of 
GIs and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs.
</p>
<p>The current position of New Zealand on GIs protection can be gleaned from 
the text of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Partnership 
Agreement.80 It provides in Article 10.5 for the recognition of GIs for wines and 
spirits, those terms listed in Annex 10.A &lsquo;within the meaning of paragraph 1 of 
Article 22 of the TRIPS Agreement&rsquo;. The Agreement makes no reference to the

</p>
<p>extended protection for wines and spirits envisaged in Article 23 of TRIPS, and 
the terms contained in Annex 10A comprise only Chilean GIs, suggesting the 
reluctance of the other negotiating parties to embrace this form of protection.
</p>
<p>The current position of the United States (and probably of Australia) on GIs 
protection can be gleaned from the leaked draft negotiating text of the Trans 
Pacific Partnership negotiations.81
</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that despite the commitment of the EU to GIs, their 
utilisation seems to be limited to agricultural enterprises in France, Italy, Spain 
and Portugal. In 2006 the EC announced a review of its system for the protection 
of GIs, including an evaluation of trade marks as an alternative instrument for 
the protection of GIs.82 The subsequent &lsquo;Green Paper on Agricultural Product 
Quality&rsquo; of 2008 and &lsquo;Impact Assessment Report on Agricultural Product 
Quality Policy&rsquo; of 2009 endorsed the complementary roles of trade marks and 
GIs in protecting agricultural products.83
</p>
<p>8. The EU, GIs and the ACP Countries
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Article 46 of the Cotonou Agreement between the members 
of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states recognises the need 
for parties to ensure an adequate and effective level of protection for IPRs 
&lsquo;including protection of geographical indications&rsquo;. This obviously supports the 
EU&rsquo;s own negotiating priorities. In an endeavour to generate empirical evidence 
about the value of GIs for ACP countries, the EU has commissioned a project 
</p>
<p>to generate empirical evidence, based on country/sub-regional and 
product case studies, regarding the benefits that African members of 
the ACP Group can obtain from enhanced multilateral Geographical 
Indication (GI) protection as a basis for the African Group to engage in 
the Doha negotiations on the establishment of the multilateral register for 
wines and spirits and the proposed extension of protection to products 
other than wines and spirits under Article 23 of TRIPS.84

</p>
<p>The countries studied in January to March 2011 were: Cameroon, Gabon, Ghana, 
Nigeria and Senegal in West and Central Africa; and: Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda 
and Tanzania in East and Southern Africa.85
</p>
<p>The project was designed to produce &lsquo;a replicable methodology for analysing 
the dynamics of capturing economic value out of GIs; access to GI-protected 
products by local populations; the role of government in the GI framework; the 
costs of establishing and administering a GI regime in a country; and the costs 
of developing, registering and enforcing individual GIs&rsquo;.86 What the project 
established was that most of the countries surveyed had enacted GIs legislation 
but that it had not yet come into effect, with the result that industries were 
relying primarily on certification or collective trade marks to protect their 
geographical brands. However, a number of EU-funded projects are under way 
in Africa to build institutional competence to underpin GIs protection for Oku 
white honey and Penja white pepper from Cameroon; Dogon onions from Mali; 
and atti&eacute;k&eacute; and Korhogo cloth from C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire. The first country to protect 
GIs in Africa is Morocco, where argan oil and products of argan trees have been 
registered. 
</p>
<p>In February 2010, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy, who was formerly head 
of the EC&rsquo;s Directorate General of Trade, explained that &lsquo;the Doha Round will 
help level the playing field for Africa, correcting historical injustices in the 
world trade rule-book&rsquo;.87 He also said that &lsquo;African agriculture needs to become 
more efficient, and in that efficiency it needs to discover &ldquo;specialization&rdquo;&rsquo;. In 
other words, the WTO, in the same way as the EU, perceives that GIs are a useful 
adjunct to the promotion of agricultural trade.
</p>
<p>9. Protecting TK through GIs
</p>
<p>In the absence of an international regime to protect TK, existing categories of 
intellectual property have sought to be applied to its protection. As Panizzon 
and Cottier observed:
</p>
<p>Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Geographical Indications (GIs) share a 
common element insofar as they both protect accumulated knowledge 
typical to a specific locality. While TK expresses the local traditions of 
knowledge, GIs stand for specific geographical origin of a typical product 
</p>
<p>85 Industries studied were: Cameroon &mdash; Oku white honey; Gabon &mdash;Okoum&eacute; timber; Ghana &mdash; cocoa; 
Kenya &mdash; black tea; Mauritius &mdash; Demerara sugar; Nigeria &mdash; yams; Rwanda &mdash; coffee; Senegal &mdash; y&ecirc;tt de Joal; 
Tanzania &mdash; cloves.

</p>
<p>or production method. GIs and TK relate a product (GIs), respectively 
a piece of information (TK), to a geographically confined people or a 
particular region or locality.88
</p>
<p>Similarly, in its Review of Existing Intellectual Property Protection of Traditional 
Knowledge,89 the IGC Secretariat observed that: 
</p>
<p>Geographical Indications as defined by Article 22.1 of the TRIPS Agreement 
and appellations of origin, as defined by Article 2 of the Lisbon Agreement 
&hellip; rely not only on their geographical connotation but also, essentially, on 
human and/or natural factors (which may have generated a given quality, 
reputation or other characteristic of the good). In practice, human and/
or natural factors are the result of traditional, standard techniques which 
local communities have developed and incorporated into production. 
Goods designated and differentiated by geographical indications, be they 
wines, spirits, cheese, handicrafts, watches, silverware and others, are as 
much expressions of local cultural and community identification as other 
elements of traditional knowledge can be.90
</p>
<p>Three examples provided by the IGC Secretariat of traditional knowledge protected 
by geographical indications are: &lsquo;Cocuy the Pecaya&rsquo; liquor from Venezuela, and &lsquo;Phu 
Quoc&rsquo; fish sauce and &lsquo;Shan Tuyet Moc Chau&rsquo; tea, both from Vietnam.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kur and Knaak observe that:
</p>
<p>The indication for a product is the subject matter of this protection, 
not the product itself. For this reason tradition-based innovations and 
creations, as indicated in the WIPO Report on Fact-finding Missions on 
Intellectual Property and TK, cannot enjoy protection per se by means 
of geographical indications. The protection of GIs may apply only to 
signs indicating these innovations and creations.91
</p>
<p>This is unquestionably the case, but it has been pointed out that all GIs whether 
&lsquo;Champagne&rsquo; wine, &lsquo;Parma&rsquo; ham or &lsquo;Roquefort&rsquo; cheese, protect not only the use 
of the indication but also the innovations which stand behind the indication.92 
Indeed, one of the functions of trade marks is that they act as a warranty of 
quality as well as an indication of the source of a product.

</p>
<p>Kur and Knaak also reject the possibility that &lsquo;kava&rsquo; from the Pacific region 
and &lsquo;rooibos&rsquo; from South Africa could be protected as &lsquo;they are not GIs per se 
as they have no direct geographical meaning&rsquo;.93 This interpretation appears to 
overlook the jurisprudence on indirect GIs. For example, the European Court of 
Justice held &lsquo;feta&rsquo; to be a GI for cheese coming from Greece, even though there 
is no geographical place of that name,94 and the UK Intellectual Property Rights 
Commission suggested that &lsquo;Basmati&rsquo; might be registered as a GI to protect rice 
from India andPakistan.95 Thus, on the same basis, &lsquo;kava&rsquo; and &lsquo;rooibos&rsquo; might be 
taken as indirect indications of the places from which they come.
</p>
<p>Among the strengths of GI protection is that it might provide for protection of 
TK which is already in the public domain. For example, in relation to kava, the 
United States Patents and Trade Marks Office granted Natrol, Inc., a US-based 
company, a US patent for &lsquo;kavatrol&rsquo;, a dietary supplement composed of kava 
that serves as a general relaxant.96 Two German companies, William Schwabe 
and Krewel-Werke, obtained a patent for kava as a prescription drug for treating 
strokes, insomnia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.97 In France, L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al has patented the 
use of kava against hair loss.98 As these products are promoted on the basis 
of their derivation from kava, GIs may prove to be the second best option for 
protecting kava by acting as a substitute for patent protection of the TK related 
to the plant itself.99
</p>
<p>From 26 to 28 August 2010, the EU-ACP organised a regional workshops on 
the protection of GIs and TK in the Pacific. This meeting, held in Nadi, Fiji, 
replicated similar events organised by the ACP-EU in Douala, Cameroon; Cape 
Town, South Africa; and Port of Spain, Trinidad. A particular feature of the 
Nadi meeting was establishing the linkage between GIs and TK protection, 
including cultural products. Potential GI products in the Pacific region which 
were identified at the workshop included: fine mat weaving from Tonga, the 
Cook Islands and Tokelau; decorative weaving from Fiji; floor mats from Papua

<p>On the other hand, it has been forcibly pointed out by Susy Frankel that GIs 
are not co-terminous with TK, and it would be a mistake to assume that GIs 
protection could perform the same function as sui generis TK protection.100 
She observes that the French appellations des origins control&eacute;es system does 
not protect the TK of the producers of traditional products but protects only 
&lsquo;the name for use by those whom the associated bureaucracy deems merit 
worthy of its use&rsquo;.101 Also, it has been acknowledged that TK admits of dynamic 
development, whereas GIs are a static form of intellectual property fixed at the 
time of registration. Frankel asserts that GIs have been &lsquo;oversold as tools of 
development&rsquo;, since they are &lsquo;not in fact developmental in any innovative way, 
but are rather tools of maintaining the status quo&rsquo; and &lsquo;the creation of a GI is not 
going to suddenly open greater markets for the knowledge held and products 
produced by indigenous peoples&rsquo;.102 However, as has been pointed out above, in 
the absence of TK protection &mdash; an absence which may persist for many years, 
given the glacial pace of progress at WIPO &mdash; GIs are only to be regarded very 
much as a second best solution. Frankel&rsquo;s strictures are a useful warning against 
acceptance of the current unsatisfactory state of affairs.
</p>
<p>10. Conclusion
</p>
<p>Although this chapter seeks to argue that the EU&rsquo;s Pacific agenda in relation 
to technical assistance concerning TK should be observed through the EU&rsquo;s 
GIs spectacles, there is, of course, a much broader economic perspective which 
has to be taken into account. EU development cooperation is provided to the 
Pacific Island countries in the context of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement 
between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific states (ACP). The EU 
as an integrated regional entity prefers to deal with other regions wherever 
possible.103  This is probably because of its comparative advantage in regionalism 
and the greater efficiency of dealing with, for example, six sub-groups within the 
ACP rather than negotiating seventy-eight bilateral partnership agreements.104

<p>Any EU technical assistance must be viewed in the context of its regionalisation 
agenda. From 2008, a number of EPAs have been entered into between the EU 
and a number of groups of ACP countries. The EPAs will succeed the trade 
provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. By way of example, in the draft proposals 
with the Economic Community of West African States and Southern African 
Development Community, substantive obligations are proposed in the areas 
of copyright and related rights, trade marks, GIs, industrial designs, patents, 
plant varieties and IPR enforcement, in exchange for trade liberalisation and 
development assistance.
</p>
<p>Matters are not as far advanced in the Pacific. In July 2009, Papua New Guinea 
signed an interim EPA with the EU, and Fiji signed an interim EPA with the 
EU in December 2009. The details of these EPAs are yet to be worked out, but 
following the African precedents, they will probably include provisions dealing 
with IPRs, including GIs.
</p>
<p>Paralleling the EU&rsquo;s EPAs, Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) 
negotiations commenced in March 2010 in Melbourne, with the participation 
of Australia, Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, Peru, the United States and 
Vietnam. Malaysia joined at the third round of negotiations in October 2010. The 
second sentence of Article 10.5.1, which deals with GIs, provides that &lsquo;[s]ubject 
to domestic laws, in a manner that is consistent with the TRIPS Agreement, 
such terms will be protected as geographical indications in the territories of 
the other Parties.&rsquo; The footnote to this provision states, for greater certainty, 
&lsquo;the Parties acknowledge that geographical indications will be recognised and 
protected in Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore only to the 
extent permitted by and according to the terms and conditions set out in their 
respective domestic laws&rsquo;. Presumably, Australia and the United States are not 
yet willing to acknowledge the existence of GIs, or they take comfort from the 
fact that their GIs are already protected by certification and collective marks. 
</p>
<p>Article 10.3.3 of the TPP provides that subject to each party&rsquo;s international 
obligations, the parties affirm that they may &lsquo;(d) establish appropriate measures 
to protect traditional knowledge&rsquo;.</p>

<p>9. Do You Want it Gift Wrapped?: 
Protecting Traditional Knowledge in 
</p>
<p>the Pacific Island Countries 
</p>
<p>Miranda Forsyth
</p>
<p>The importance of customary law and customary institutions in the context of 
protecting the traditional knowledge (TK)1 of indigenous people is gradually 
being more widely recognised.2 However, translating this recognition into 
practice still seems a long way off, as very few countries have developed a 
protection framework that provides a role for customary institutions.3 The 
Pacific Island countries are currently in the process of moving forward with 
such an initiative, and their experiences offer important insights into the 
challenges associated with it. This chapter begins by discussing the TK agenda 
as it has been pursued in the region for the past decade, and in particular 
the development of the Regional Framework for the Protection of Traditional 
Knowledge and Expressions of Culture (2002), which has been cited as a best 
practice approach.4
</p>
<p>The Pacific Island countries have approached the protection of what may be 
called &lsquo;traditional cultural expressions&rsquo; separately from the protection of 
biological knowledge, innovations and practices,5 and as a result the scope of this 
</p>
<p>1 There are many definitions of TK in the academic and grey literature and draft legislation: see, for example, 
Antons&rsquo; summary in C Antons (ed), Traditional Knowledge, Traditional Cultural Expressions and Intellectual 
Property Law in the Asia-Pacific Region (Kluwer Law International, 2009) 1-4. For the purposes of this 
chapter the definition provided in the Model Law is adopted, namely: &lsquo;traditional knowledge includes any 
knowledge that generally (a) is or has been created, acquired or inspired for traditional economic, spiritual, 
ritual, narrative, decorative or recreational purposes; and (b) is or has been transmitted from generation to 
generation; and (c) is regarded as pertaining to a particular traditional group, clan or community of people; 
and (d) is collectively originated and held&rsquo;.
2 See Articles 18 and 31 of UNDRIP; Articles 8(j) and 10(c) of CBD; and the many references to customary law 
in the World Intellectual Property Organization&rsquo;s Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and 
Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore, The Protection of Traditional Cultural Expressions/ 
Expressions of Folklore: Revised Objectives and Principles (2010) &lt;http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/tk/en/

Community for the Protection of Traditional Cultural Expressions&rsquo; in Antons, above n 1, 109, 119. 
5 These are dealt with in the recent Model Law on Traditional Biological Knowledge, Innovations and Practices 
&lt;http://www.sprep.org/legal/documents/MLv11.doc4Apr_000.pdf&gt;  The separation between these two types 
of TK could be argued to be unhelpful and as undermining an attempt to view TK as holistically as possible.</p>

<p>chapter is limited to the TK that is found in songs, stories, oral traditions, visual 
and performing arts, ritual and cultural practices, and architectural forms.6 The 
chapter then builds the case that existing customary law and institutions are 
central to TK, and that this mandates the adoption of a pluralistic approach to 
the protection of TK. It then demonstrates that the current approach towards TK 
in the Pacific Island countries is not a truly (or deeply) pluralistic one, despite 
the many references to customary law and institutions in the legislation and 
policy documents. Moreover, it is based on a number of assumptions about the 
nature of customary law and the reach of state law and state institutions in 
the region that may not be valid. Following suggestions from academics such 
as Boyle7 and Drahos8 to look at the disadvantages as well as the advantages 
of extending the reach of any type of intellectual property protection, I then 
identify a number of problems that are likely to flow from an implementation 
of the current state-centric approach. In conclusion, the chapter outlines what 
a more pluralistic approach to the protection of TK in any jurisdiction would 
involve.
</p>
<p>The main aim of the chapter is to urge caution with moves towards the protection 
of TK and to stress the necessity of properly respecting the existing customary 
regulatory structure that almost certainly exists in every country in which TK 
is present. The protection of TK by the state, which inevitably involves the 
creation of new rights and owners of those rights, is not self-evidently a step 
forward for indigenous people, and even risks endangering the TK it sets out to 
protect. Boyle&rsquo;s caution that &lsquo;when you set up property rule in some new space, 
you determine much about the history that follows&rsquo;9 is thus equally as apposite 
in the TK context as in that of genes and databases.
</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I have already commented on the Model Law when it was 
first enacted in 2002.10 Although the law itself has not changed since, my views 
of it have altered radically in the intervening period. This is largely a result of 
the intensive study of customary law in Vanuatu undertaken in 2002 to 2008, 
a field with which I was unfamiliar when I first encountered the Model Law. 
This study11 and my understanding of the theory of legal pluralism inform the 
observations I make concerning customary law in this chapter.

<p>1. The Traditional Knowledge Agenda in the 
Pacific Island Countries
</p>
<p>The move to protect TK in the region has been proceeding in fits and starts for 
over a decade. A Symposium on the Protection of Traditional Knowledge and 
Expressions of Indigenous Cultures in the Pacific Islands held by the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1999 
concluded with a Declaration that recommended technical assistance and support 
for &lsquo;a homogeneous system of legal protection, identification, conservation and 
control of exploitation, of indigenous culture&rsquo;.12 This led to the production of 
the Model Law by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community in 2002.13
</p>
<p>The movement for protection of TK thus began at a very high policy level, 
and at the initiative of international and regional, rather than local, institutions 
and actors. Right from the start it is possible to identify a number of different, 
and arguably competing, aims for TK legislation, all covered by the amorphous 
term &lsquo;protection&rsquo;. Three main concepts associated with the term can be distilled: 
the conservation of TK in the face of pressures resulting from rapid social 
change; the misappropriation of TK; and the facilitation of commercialisation 
of TK by the TK holders themselves. All these different aims are present in 
the regional documents concerning TK, although to date there has been little 
acknowledgment of the fact that conservation of cultural heritage and traditions 
may well be incompatible with the establishment of a structure that facilitates 
their commercialisation.14 A similar conflation of aims was identified in Papua 
New Guinea by Kalinoe, who argues that the difficulty in finding a suitable 
model for protection may in part be because people have been misled &lsquo;into 
thinking that these matters can be comfortably housed together&rsquo;.15
</p>
<p>The Model Law was adopted by the Forum Trade Ministers in 2003. In many 
ways it follows the general contours established by the UNESCO-World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Model Provisions for National Laws 
on the Protection of Expressions of Folklore Against Illicit Exploitation and 
Other Prejudicial Actions (1985). It confers upon owners of TK the right to 
authorise others to exploit their TK, and to prevent others from exploiting it

<p>without their free, prior informed and full consent. It requires the authorisation 
to be in writing and to be approved by an expressly created national authority. 
Until 2009 there was little movement by individual countries in respect 
of implementing the law, but in that year the issue gained momentum with 
the creation of the Traditional Knowledge Implementation Action Plan 
(2009) (Action Plan).16 The Action Plan is being implemented by the Forum 
Secretariat working with the Trade Commission, WIPO, the Secretariat of the 
Pacific Community (SPC) and Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental 
Program, and is said to be based on a mandate of Forum Trade Ministers and the 
Forum Leaders&rsquo; directives in the Pacific Plan (2005).17 Perhaps not surprisingly, 
given the partners involved and the trade context in which it has developed, 
the Action Plan prioritises the commercialisation of TK over any other objective, 
stating &lsquo;Improved policy transparency, the creation of a supportive environment 
for private sector expansion and economic growth, and assuring accountability 
and good governance underpin the Action Plan.&rsquo;18 As of 2011, there were six 
countries drafting a national law based on the Model Law.19 Of these, the only 
publicly available draft is that of Palau, which produced a Bill in 2005, but this 
has not yet been passed by its legislature.20
</p>
<p>The Action Plan has a clear regionalisation agenda. A press statement refers 
to &lsquo;uniform national legal systems of protection&rsquo;21 and envisages a &lsquo;regional 
arrangement of mutual recognition and enforcement regime to protect and 
promote TK use&rsquo;.22 This regionalisation agenda is far more muted in the Model 
Law, which merely urges countries to adopt and adapt the Model as they see fit. 
It raises an important question about the expected reach of the legislation &mdash; or, 
to put it in another way, who is the intended target of the regulation? 
</p>
<p>To answer this it is necessary to examine the stated aims of the legislation. 
The Action Plan articulates the driving rationale as being that the &lsquo;continued 
exposure of Pacific TK to improper exploitation without due compensation 
demands that a regional approach be adopted as a matter of urgency while an 
international regime is being finalized&rsquo;.23 Leaving aside the fact that no empirical

<p>study is presented or cited to substantiate this belief, national or even regional 
legislation is unlikely to prevent this from occurring. With the exception of Fiji 
and possibly Samoa, the manufacturing capacity of most countries in the region 
is very limited, and therefore any mass production is likely to occur outside the 
jurisdictional limits of all the countries involved. The legislation must therefore 
primarily be considered in terms of its regulatory effects on the Pacific Islanders 
themselves, and their exceedingly small populations of non-indigenous citizens 
(except in Fiji). There is arguably thus little to be gained by working towards a 
uniform regional approach and, as discussed below, much to be lost from failing 
to take into account local differences across the region.
</p>
<p>This brief discussion has argued that the movement to protect TK in the region 
is currently largely driven by economic considerations and is being pursued 
in a state-centred way. The next section argues that a different approach, one 
that supports, rather than cuts across, customary institutions in regulating TK, 
would be preferable for the region.
</p>
<p>2. The Need for a Pluralistic Approach to 
Protection of TK
</p>
<p>To understand the importance of a pluralistic approach to TK, the centrality of 
customary law and institutions to TK must be appreciated. This section briefly 
discusses the nature of customary laws and institutions in the region, and 
then goes on to demonstrate their inter-relatedness with TK and the social and 
economic underpinnings of the communities to which they belong. As Drahos 
argues, &lsquo;systems are nested phenomena&rsquo;,24 and the customary law system in all 
countries is nested within particular economic and social systems. The third part 
of this section then argues that adopting a pluralistic approach to regulating TK 
would nurture the relationship between customary laws and institutions, even 
in the context of a nation state.
</p>
<p>(a) The Nature of Customary Laws and Institutions in 
the Pacific Island Countries
</p>
<p>Whilst it is extremely difficult to make any generalisation about a region 
as diverse as the Pacific Islands, it is true to say that despite the forces of 
colonisation, decolonisation and the creation of independent liberal nation 
states, every one of the Pacific Island countries continues to have an indigenous

</p>
<p>system of governance that exists largely independent of the state.25 This system 
is generally administered at a community level by traditional leaders, known as 
chiefs in some places and &lsquo;old men&rsquo; or &lsquo;big men&rsquo; in others. These leaders were 
traditionally responsible for regulating all aspects of the social and economic 
relationships in their communities, and today continue to be responsible for 
a great many of them, especially in areas least affected by the cash economy 
and the institutions of the nation state.26 This regulation is done through the 
use of established community norms (both explicit and implicit) and, perhaps 
more importantly, an autochthonous process of conflict management that varies 
across the region. This process is based on various principles, which vary from 
community to community and country to country, but are mostly restorative 
in nature and concerned with maintaining community peace. These principles 
are employed by the leaders, using various established procedures such as 
community meetings, to arrive at solutions that manage all community and inter-
community disputes, including those over TK. For example, an anthropologist 
working with the Zia people in Papua New Guinea observes:
</p>
<p>From my work, it seems clear that there are set systems, patterns, 
procedures and rules involved in dispersing certain property. Also there 
are types of information available. Information that is general, specific, 
magical, ritual, sacred, secret, spiritual, etc, which is processed in 
accordance with the rules, how that information relates to a possessor 
(could be a group, individual, spirit, gender related etc)&hellip;cultural 
property exists within flows of transactions that are as intricate and 
precisely executed as those of an ecosystem.27
</p>
<p>The system as a whole is dynamic and driven by the needs of a particular 
dispute or event, rather than by concerns to lay down a prescriptive normative 
framework. In other words, customary law, including that concerning TK, is 
continually evolving and is in many ways an ongoing dialogue about the way 
things should be done in the community, mediated by the customary leaders. 
</p>
<p>It is also true to say that in every country in the region these customary 
institutions are under a great deal of pressure as a result of both rapid social 
change in the region over the past several decades and the challenges of 
competing state governance structures.28 Customary laws and institutions are

to name a few.

</p>
<p>thus just as vulnerable to extinction as other aspects of TK, and hence strategies 
for their reinforcement must be considered at the same time as protection of TK 
for the reasons discussed below.
</p>
<p>(b) The Centrality of Customary Laws and Institutions 
to TK
</p>
<p>Customary law and institutions currently regulate entitlements to TK, but TK 
and customary law are linked in an even more fundamental way. Thus, while 
traditional leaders, institutions and laws are central to social and economic 
relations in the Pacific Island countries, TK is the very &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; with which those 
social and economic relations are woven (and that dreams are made of &mdash; see 
below). For example, TK is crucial in determining leadership status, agricultural 
practices, navigation and trade routes, ceremonial practices, rights to land and 
land use, spiritual beliefs, healing practices, social organisation, concepts of 
belonging and exchange networks. Du Plessis and Fairbairn-Dunlop argue:
</p>
<p>The indigenous knowledge systems of the Pacific incorporate technical 
insights and detailed observations of natural, social and spiritual 
phenomena, which in turn are used to validate what is important in life 
&mdash; what sustains people and what connects them to particular places 
and spaces, and is crucial to their identity&hellip; In Pacific communities, 
knowledge is communally made, sanctioned, shared and used with 
the aim of achieving the good life for all members &mdash; however this is 
defined.29
</p>
<p>Even the development of new knowledge is rooted in communal sources. Thus 
Lindstrom observes:
</p>
<p>Islanders do not explain their production of songs or other new 
knowledge in terms of a knower&rsquo;s individual talent, genius or creativity. 
Local epistemology seeks authorities and not individual authors&hellip;the 
Tannese intimate that they are repeating truths told by their fathers, 
whispered by spirits when intoxicated by kava, or revealed by ancestors 
in dreams.30
</p>
<p>TK is often intimately bound up with social organisation in a particular 
community because access to it may be possessed only by certain members of 
that community. For example, knowledge about a particular ancestor-creator 
may be limited to people of certain status in a particular community. Thus, 
Whimp, in a study of Papua New Guinea, observes:
</p>

100-111.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>196
</p>
<p>At least in some Papua New Guinea societies, the value of knowledge, 
for example, is inversely related to the number of people who possess it. 
The more people who know something, the less significant it is assumed 
to be. Restricting access to knowledge can reinforce cultural identity 
and strengthen social hierarchies and inequalities.31
</p>
<p>The exchange of TK is also important to the maintenance and development of 
social networks. Busse and Whimp argue that &lsquo;the primary purpose and result of 
gift exchanges are to establish and maintain relations between persons making 
such exchanges&rsquo;32 and that &lsquo;the power of gift exchanges to create enduring social 
relationships lies precisely in the fact that the objects given are not completely 
alienated&rsquo;.33 The fruitful exchange of TK, which also stimulates the production 
of new TK, is facilitated in part by the decentralised nature of the customary 
laws and institutions that regulate it today.
</p>
<p>Many anthropologists have commented upon the difficulty of divorcing the 
materiality of objects from their immateriality in this region. Jolly argues that 
&lsquo;the materiality of these objects [so-called primitive art] could not be so easily 
divorced from immateriality, the meanings, the ideas, the relations, the values, 
the agency with which they were endowed by their creators, users and original 
spectators&rsquo;.34 Bolton, for example, sees woven pandanus mats &lsquo;not as objects 
but as the materialisation of relations, as animated agents, like persons; their 
importance is &ldquo;not what they mean, but what they do&rdquo;&rsquo;.35
</p>
<p>This discussion of the nature of TK and of customary norms has at least two 
important ramifications for the protection of TK. The first is that neither TK nor 
customary norms can sensibly be separated from the social processes in which 
they have been developed, although this is often what Western reforms such 
as the Model Law attempt to do. A holistic approach is therefore necessary &mdash; 
one that sees TK in what Sillitoe calls &lsquo;a wider cultural context&rsquo;.36 The second 
is that it is difficult to boil down the multiple links and resonances that TK has 
within the community of which it is a part to a single &lsquo;right&rsquo; that is &lsquo;owned&rsquo; by a 
clearly defined group of people. Moreover, there can be all sorts of ramifications 
flowing from unauthorised access to TK that can only be dealt with by the

</p>
<p>community leaders. These observations suggest that it is unwise to equate 
customary entitlements to access to TK with &lsquo;ownership&rsquo;37 and that the best 
people to regulate access to TK are the customary leaders themselves.
</p>
<p>(c) Weak and Deep Legal Pluralism
</p>
<p>The aim of this section is to demonstrate that recognition of the centrality 
of customary law and customary institutions to TK dictates the adoption of 
a deep pluralist approach to TK. Such an approach involves the construction 
of a framework that supports the relevant customary institutions and allows 
them room to operate by themselves, rather than subsuming them within a 
state structure. This approach can be contrasted with so-called &lsquo;weak&rsquo; legal 
pluralism, where customary norms are removed from their institutional context 
and applied by the state system.38 In other words, deep legal pluralism involves 
the co-existence of legal orders with different sources of authority, whereas in 
weak legal pluralism there is only one legal order (the state) drawing upon two 
different bodies of norms.39 As Griffiths observes, &lsquo;[T]hese two perspectives give 
rise to different strategies for dealing with customary law namely whether to 
work for recognition of customary law within the state national legal system, or 
whether to claim recognition for it outside this system.&rsquo;40
</p>
<p>To date, these two different types of approaches have not been clearly 
differentiated in much of the literature concerning TK. The result is that weak 
legal pluralism is often being advocated as the appropriate way to recognise 
customary law and institutions. For example, Pigliasco argues: &lsquo;The question 
that arises is not whether or not the sanctions of customary law are applicable 
to outsiders, but rather the extent to which the rights relating to cultural 
expressions &mdash; as granted by custom to certain traditional custodians &mdash; are 
recognized by national legislations, and thus could be enforced.&rsquo;41 Kruk 
similarly states: &lsquo;Customary law would remain an effective method of protecting 
traditional knowledge only insofar as it is recognised and applied in national 
legal systems by the courts.&rsquo;42 He advocates attempts &lsquo;to recognize formally 
the legal status of customary law in the legal system and then to improve on 
the current methods of ascertaining and applying rules relating to traditional

<p>knowledge&rsquo;.43 Antons also observes that &lsquo;stronger recognition of customary law 
principles could be very helpful in resolving some of the issues surrounding 
traditional knowledge&rsquo;, and then states: &lsquo;The big question is, however, how to 
integrate them into the state legal system.&rsquo;44 The error of this type of approach 
is in assuming it is possible to take customary norms out of their context and 
have them applied by a foreign system. As discussed above, norms, procedures 
and knowledge are interwoven in a complex and dynamic way, at least in the 
Pacific Island countries and probably in most indigenous legal systems, meaning 
that an exercise such as that which Pigliasco and Kruk advocate is not possible.
</p>
<p>There are some who take a broader view, particularly indigenous scholars and 
anthropologists. For example, Solomon argues in a Māori context that there 
is a &lsquo;need to give priority to the strengthening and development of existing 
customary law systems, which reflect and nourish the underlying values of 
the relevant cultures and associated biodiversity&rsquo;.45 Whimp also argues: &lsquo;In 
considering laws to explicitly protect rights in intellectual property, it is critical 
that Papua New Guinean ideas about ownership, property, knowledge, and 
creativity are taken into account if those laws are to reflect the contemporary 
social and political contexts in which they will be applied.&rsquo;46 Most recently the 
International Institute for Environment and Development has recommended that 
customary law and customary authorities should be central to the development 
of protection systems.47 However, to date no one has articulated how this can be 
done in practice. An attempt is made to do this in the last part of this chapter.
</p>
<p>3. A Pluralistic Analysis of the Model Law and 
Action Plan 
</p>
<p>This section uses the theory of legal pluralism discussed in the preceding section 
to analyse the extent to which the Model Law and associated initiatives support 
customary law and institutions both procedurally and substantively. To date, 
academic commentary on the Model Law has been positive and has praised the Model 
Law&rsquo;s extensive references to customary law.48 My analysis below is more critical.

</p>
<p>On a procedural level, the TK initiative in the region has been almost entirely 
state focused. The top-down approach outlined in the Action Plan emphasises the 
drafting of legislation as an initial step, and envisages community consultation 
as occurring only significantly down the track. Even then, the community 
consultation is not seen primarily as a way of developing the framework along 
with the community leaders, but rather as an opportunity for TK owners to 
&lsquo;understand the implications of the Model Law and the effect of subsequent 
proposed legislation on their resources&rsquo;.49 The exploration of a possible role 
for customary laws and practices is regarded as only a &lsquo;medium-term period&rsquo; 
activity.50 This state-centred approach is also supported by various official 
statements. For example, the Director of the Institute of Fijian Language and 
Culture states that in Fiji &lsquo;We have a legal consultant who is finally working 
with this national law which will come into effect in 2010. So we hope that the 
law will also be taken down to the grassroots people, the owners and custodians 
of ICH in consultations, so their views will be heard and that the law will be 
amended accordingly.&rsquo;51 The problem with this approach is that it is significantly 
more difficult to alter a law once it has been drafted or even enacted than it is at 
the policy development stage: by then the general contours of the framework are 
fixed and there is relatively little room to negotiate. A far preferable approach 
would be to conduct research into the customary institutions and laws involved 
as a first step, and to consult widely amongst TK holders and customary leaders 
before drafting any laws. Ironically, the Action Plan refers to the importance of 
adopting a &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;52 and holistic approach53 while outlining the opposite.
</p>
<p>On a substantive level, at first and even second and third glances, the Model 
Law appears to create a central role for both customary law and customary 
institutions. The decisions concerning access are delegated to TK holders, 
and responsibilities given to customary institutions to, for example, decide 
ownership. However, a close analysis demonstrates that it is not a truly 
pluralistic law. It establishes a system and a value structure that are predicated 
upon certain views of TK, customary law and the type of protection that is 
important, and assumes that TK holders and customary institutions will just 
slot into them. The misfit between the aim of the legislation to be sensitive to 
customary law and the reality that it is not sensitive to it arises because the 
legislation is based upon a view of both TK and customary law as inert, so that 
clearly defined chunks of content can be removed from their context and still

<p>make sense. However, as we have seen above, both are dynamic, amorphous and 
interactive. To demonstrate these points, this section now discusses four ways 
the Model Law refers to customary law and institutions.
</p>
<p>(a) The Distinction Between Customary and Non-
customary Use
</p>
<p>The Model Law draws a distinction between customary and non-customary 
use, and intends to regulate only the latter. However, it is no simple matter to 
determine what is meant by &lsquo;customary use&rsquo;, given the constantly changing 
nature of custom. The legislation defines customary use as &lsquo;use of traditional 
knowledge or expressions of culture in accordance with the customary laws 
and practices of the traditional owners&rsquo;.54 This does not, however, make it 
clear whether permission to use the TK following the custom of the relevant 
community is required, or if the use must be permitted by the custom of the 
relevant community. If it came to a dispute about this issue, it would be a matter 
for the courts rather than the customary institutions to decide, as they have 
prima facie jurisdiction over all disputes concerning state legislation. Lacking 
the flexible processes that underpin customary institutions, the courts could 
answer this question only by looking at precedents established by customary 
laws in the past. The consequence of this provision is that the Act is in effect 
making a division between traditional and new uses of TK, and mandating the 
involvement of the state in the latter. 
</p>
<p>These arguments may be better followed in the context of an example drawn 
from one of the very few court cases in the region that involves TK: the &lsquo;Nagol 
jump&rsquo; dispute in Pentecost, one of the islands that comprise the country of 
Vanuatu. The facts of this case are set out in the Supreme Court&rsquo;s judgment,55 but 
the essentials can be summarised as follows. 
</p>
<p>The Nagol jump is an important tradition in a number of villages on South 
Pentecost.56 It involves men jumping from a specially constructed high tower 
to which they are tethered by vines tied to their ankles. Ideally, the vines are 
exactly the right length for the men neither to crash to their death nor be jerked 
back violently into the tower. In 1992 a group of men from South Pentecost 
(group X) decided that they were not adequately profiting from the tourism that 
has come from the Nagol jump, so proposed performing the jump on another 
island, Santo. They started negotiations with the relevant chiefly council,

of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific, 1994) 131, 141.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>201
</p>
<p>and the head of the council agreed that the jump could be done for the three 
following years, provided the National Council of Chiefs (NCC) agreed. The head 
of the council then went to the capital, Port Vila, to negotiate with the NCC. In 
his absence a number of the group decided to go ahead without waiting for his 
return. They were warned by customary leaders not to do so, but refused to 
listen. When they got to Santo they were met by the relevant chiefs there and 
told to pay a fine and to return to Pentecost to start discussions. Group X then 
applied to the Supreme Court for a declaration that their constitutional rights 
had been breached.57
</p>
<p>So, is taking the jump to Santo customary use or not? According to the judgment, 
the Nagol had been performed outside Pentecost on two previous occasions for 
particular reasons. Arguably, therefore, taking it to Santo was not completely 
without precedent and could still be regarded as a customary use. On the 
other hand, it could be argued that it was a non-customary use, as the proper 
procedures for applying for it to be taken to Santo were not followed, and its 
historical association with Pentecost means its performance there is central to 
its very rationale.58 This example demonstrates that there is not always a clear 
distinction between customary and non-customary use, and that customary 
institutions are able to deal in a fair and innovative way with new uses of TK. 
It also suggests the need to be careful before transferring jurisdiction over 
such disputes to the state or creating new avenues for &lsquo;appealing&rsquo; and hence 
undermining decisions made by customary authorities (as occurred in the 
example case). 
</p>
<p>(b) Determining Ownership
</p>
<p>It can be assumed that ownership is likely to be controversial in many cases, 
especially if there is the real or imaginary prospect of a windfall gain. One has 
only to look at the bitter disputes that have accompanied the return of land to 
customary &lsquo;owners&rsquo; when countries become independent and the distribution 
of royalties from resource developments across Melanesia to visualise the 
</p>
<p>57 They claimed that their rights under sections 5(1)(g), (h), (i) and (k) were breached. These are the rights 
to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of movement, and equal treatment 
before the law. The court found there was no relevant law applicable and therefore it was necessary to follow 
section 47(1) of the Constitution, requiring the court to determine the matter according to &lsquo;substantial justice&rsquo; 
and if at all possible in conformity with custom. His Honour then ordered that the Nagol jumping should 
return to Pentecost and that any future decision for it to leave Pentecost should only occur with the majority 
consent of the custom owners taken on a vote. This appears never to have occurred and the Nagol jump has 
remained in Pentecost. This case is in many ways a success, as the state legal system was able to reinforce the 
customary system. However, it was largely dependent upon the proclivities of the particular judge as there 
was no guiding law, and his Honour imposed a requirement on the movement of the Nagol (the requirement 
of a vote) that was uncalled for by the customary leaders and to an extent cut across their authority over the 
matter.
58 See Jolly, above n 34.</p>

</p>
<p>202
</p>
<p>potential difficulties involved in determining rights to certain aspects of cultural 
heritage.59 As with land, the problems of determining the limits of entitlement 
to TK claims are compounded by the movement of communities as a result of 
missionisation, plantation labour, epidemics and, more recently, urban drift.60 
The potential complexities of ownership can be illustrated by Lindstom&rsquo;s 
description of rights to kava in Vanuatu: 
</p>
<p>[i]ndividuals (and their families and lineages) may claim overlapping 
rights to this or that kava variety, and would deny common cultural 
heritage. There are also (chiefly) titled versus untitled, and male versus 
female, claims to use and exchange kava. On the island of Tanna, for 
example, certain families have the right to consume specially grown 
and decorated kava tapunga at festivals celebrating boys&rsquo; circumcisions. 
Overlapping claims to this sort of kava by scattered families across the 
island would be difficult to adjudicate. Any sui generis patent system 
that awarded general rights to kava to all ni-Vanuatu, or to the state, 
also could spark opposition from individuals, regions, kin-groups, and 
classes jealous of their particular kava claims.61
</p>
<p>By introducing the concept of &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; of TK by a finite group of people 
whose rights are backed by the state, the Model Law is therefore introducing a 
new and almost certainly troublesome concept into the regulation of TK in the 
region. The fact that it recognises that there may be communal or individual 
ownership does not avoid the difficulties that are likely to arise in determining 
the membership of the ownership group.
</p>
<p>Under the Model Law, once a request to the cultural authority (CA) is made by 
a prospective user of TK, the CA is responsible for identifying the owners of the 
TK. This must be done by publishing a copy of the application in a newspaper 
and, if appropriate, on the radio or television.62 The owners then have twenty-
eight days to advise the CA of their claim. Then if the CA &lsquo;is satisfied that it has 
identified all the traditional owners&rsquo; it must make a written determination.63 
There are no criteria to assist it in determining what standard of satisfaction is 
required. The only requirement is that the CA note down the parties who have 
advised they are the owners, and make a written decision and then publish

</p>
<p>it. This determination then provides a conclusive defence for any user of TK 
if the traditional owners specified in the determination have given their prior 
informed consent to the use.64 This means that there is no effective way for 
contesting owners to appeal the CA&rsquo;s decision about ownership. 
</p>
<p>If the CA is not satisfied it has identified all the owners, or if there is a 
dispute, the CA &lsquo;must refer the matter to the persons concerned to be resolved 
according to customary law and practice or such other means as are agreed to 
by the parties&rsquo;.65 This is the closest the legislation comes to deep pluralism, 
and is clearly a step in the right direction. However, very clear thinking and 
development with the relevant customary institutions and leaders will be 
needed at the national implementation stage. It is not enough to create a new and 
controversial concept, and then to delegate responsibility for resolving claims to 
it to customary authorities without prior consultation. It is especially unfair to 
require customary authorities to deal with such claims within the presumably 
limited timeframe set down in the legislation. If the experiences of customary 
land tenure in the region are anything to go by, these are going to be particularly 
thorny issues that could generate a great deal of internal community conflict. 
Customary institutions must therefore be properly supported in preparation for 
such responsibility.
</p>
<p>If the CA is satisfied that no owners can be identified or no agreement has been 
reached on ownership within the period set out in the legislation, it may take 
the somewhat draconian measure of making a determination that the CA is 
the traditional owner.66 The only guidance given about whether or not the CA 
should make this decision is to consult with the relevant Minister. The CA is 
then free to enter into an agreement with the prospective user or not, with no 
guidance provided as to what should drive the decision-making (such as, for 
example, the views of the ownership contestants). The only limitation on the 
CA&rsquo;s power is that any benefits arising under the agreement must be used for 
traditional cultural development purposes. It is interesting that the possibility 
of holding them in trust until ownership is determined is not an option. This is 
the approach that has been taken in the Palau legislation, and seems preferable.67 
In other respects, however, the Palauan approach to ownership is far more 
unreasonable: the legislation provides that all the TK in Palau belongs to the 
state until ownership is proven otherwise.68

</p>
<p>(c) Requirement of State Assent for Use of TK by a 
Pacific Islander
</p>
<p>The Act is unclear about what rights a member of a community of traditional 
owners has with regard to TK. It appears that a member of the TK-holding 
community needs to get the prior informed consent of the other members of the 
community if he or she wants to use the TK in a way that is non-customary. Thus, 
the explanatory memorandum (EM) notes, &lsquo;if [a] person intends to perform [a 
dance from his/her community] in a non-customary way, for example performing 
the dance in non-customary costumes and with non-customary music, the 
person must obtain the prior and informed consent of the traditional owners as 
set out in Part 4&rsquo;. This explanation also seems to suggest that &lsquo;customary use&rsquo; is 
synonymous with &lsquo;traditional use&rsquo; as discussed above.
</p>
<p>To make matters more complicated, it is not enough to get the prior informed 
consent of all the owners. It is also necessary to involve the state &mdash; at the 
bare minimum, by advising the CA that the potential user has sought the prior 
informed consent of the other traditional owners, filling out a copy of the 
proposed user agreement, submitting it to the CA for advice, and providing a 
copy of the signed authorised user agreement to the CA no more than twenty-
eight days after the agreement comes into force.69 So if, for example, a group of 
school children wanted to perform a custom story from their village to a rap beat 
for their Christmas play, they would be required to go through this cumbersome 
process. Particularly in remote areas where the reach of the state is weak and 
communication difficult, this seems a ridiculously bureaucratic process, and one 
that is significantly disenfranchising of the local customary authorities whose 
decision is no longer sufficient.
</p>
<p>(d) Dispute Resolution
</p>
<p>Although section 33 states that the parties can always use customary law and 
practice to resolve disputes, customary law is not mandated as a primary forum 
and the customary institutions are not given any state enforcement powers. 
It therefore appears highly unlikely that customary law and practice will be 
able to be used in hotly contested cases, as disputes about forum are likely to 
undermine its authority.70 This is especially the case given the importance for 
the parties of meeting the statutory timeframe or else risking losing all to the 
CA.
</p>
<p>The above discussion demonstrates that the approach adopted to date by the 
Model Law is not truly pluralistic, despite the many references to customary 
</p>

<p>205
</p>
<p>law. At almost every turn, the state has been given a central role and customary 
institutions marginalised. Before discussing the problems that may arise from 
this, it is useful to reflect on why this approach has been adopted and to assess 
how much justification there is for it. The primary reason for its adoption is 
that customary institutions are perceived to be uncertain and difficult to access, 
whereas centralising control in the state has the apparent benefits of simplicity 
and efficiency. Thus a state-based system is seen to facilitate access to TK by 
outsiders.71 A legislative reform whose only objective is the commercialisation 
of TK by outsiders may therefore prioritise a state-based approach, but it may 
be only a short-term solution because it may lead to the undermining of TK 
itself. The state is also seen as being more responsible and capable of making 
decisions to benefit the population as a whole. However, the example of the 
Tongan state entering into an agreement with a multinational company to collect 
samples of blood from its population for gene research,72 and the high levels of 
government corruption in the region, show that the state is not necessarily to 
be implicitly trusted. Involvement of the state is also seen to be a safeguard 
against communities entering into unfair agreements with outsiders due to 
an imbalance in bargaining power. This is certainly a legitimate point, but 
safeguarding the communities against unfair contracts should be targeted with a 
great deal more precision than the current legislation does. Yet again this points 
to the necessity of clearly identifying the aims of the legislation, and perhaps 
separating competing aims into different pieces of legislation.
</p>
<p>4. Potential Problems Arising from the Lack of 
a Deep Pluralist Approach
</p>
<p>The preceding section demonstrated the lack of real engagement with customary 
institutions and law by the Model Law. This section discusses a range of problems 
that could arise if the legislation were implemented nationally in its present 
form. Drahos and Braithwaite remind us that this type of cost-benefit exercise is 
extremely important in the field of intellectual property, but that assessing the 
disadvantages of intellectual property protection is often overlooked while the 
advantages of greater levels of protection are emphasised.73 As a general point, it 
may be said that the approach currently adopted by the Model Law shares many 
of the characteristics of traditional intellectual property legislation. However,

<p>as Posey argues, such laws are &lsquo;inadequate and inappropriate for protection of 
traditional ecological knowledge and community resources&rsquo; because, inter alia, 
&lsquo;they simplify ownership regimes, stimulate commercialisation, are difficult to 
monitor and enforce, and are expensive, complicated and time-consuming.&rsquo;74
</p>
<p>(a) The New Framework Undermines Customary 
Institutions and Thus TK Itself
</p>
<p>The inter-relationship between customary institutions, TK, and the social and 
economic basis of communities has been discussed above. The very intrusion of 
the state into this field threatens these important relationships, as it introduces 
a competing source of authority. One of the chief concerns with the Model Law 
is that it puts the evolution of TK into the state&rsquo;s hands, because it is the state 
that is deciding the threshold questions about what is customary and what is 
not. It thus usurps a very important role for customary institutions: that of 
finding a path through the challenges of modernity whilst maintaining those 
traditional values that continue to be of importance to the local community. It 
also undermines customary institutions by requiring the involvement of the 
state (through the CA) in every non-customary use of TK by the community, 
thus again cutting across the authority of the local institutions. As mentioned 
above, existing customary institutions are fragile in the region, and there is a 
real possibility that challenges to their authority by the state may cause them 
to break down altogether. As I demonstrated in another study in the context 
of criminal law, where there are two competing sources of authority (state and 
customary) there is a great temptation to avoid the authority of each by using 
one to criticise the legitimacy of the other.75 The worst possible outcome would 
be for the new state structures to aid the disappearance of existing regulatory 
structures, but to be unable to provide an effective replacement due to the 
weakness of the state that characterises much of the region.
</p>
<p>(b) Fostering of Community Division
</p>
<p>There is a very great risk that the Model Law and other initiatives in the 
Action Plan, such as the creation of databases, may become a catalyst for 
internal conflicts. Claims over ownership of particular traditional practices, 
particularly where there is a hope of economic benefit, have the potential to 
cause considerable community tension. Strathern argues:

</p>
<p>207
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights seem a poor social register and may even set 
people against one another. If the identification of individual authors 
or inventors becomes problematic in light of traditional authorship and 
collective inventions, then the identification of individual property 
holders becomes problematic in the light of multiple claims. Even 
if a group can be identified, who belongs to the group? Who is the 
representative to speak on its behalf? What about power inequalities 
between different interests within the group?76
</p>
<p>The problem of disputes has already arisen in a database initiative in Fiji run 
by the Ministry of Indigenous Affairs. Reflecting on this programme, the 
Director of the Institute of Fijian Language and Culture notes that disputes by 
communities over ownership are an ongoing problem.77 Such considerations 
make it essential that clear avenues for dealing with such disputes are firmly in 
place. Unfortunately, as discussed above, this is an area where the Model Law is 
extremely unclear.
</p>
<p>The links between intellectual property and opportunistic behaviour recently 
outlined by Drahos also have application here.78 Thus, the monopolistic 
approach set up in the legislation, whereby one group wins absolute access 
over TK (without even a limited time period, as in Western-style intellectual 
property legislation), is likely to promote rent-seeking behaviour by the 
particular &lsquo;owners&rsquo; that will cause further divisions within society and restrict 
the traditional structures for the diffusion of TK. Moreover, by positivising TK 
by law and state bureaucracy, a number of well-known regulatory difficulties 
(for example, regulatory capture of patent offices) are potentially opened up, 
and these may be particularly problematic in developing countries because of 
weak and/or corrupt state institutions. 
</p>
<p>(c) Unreasonably Raised Expectations
</p>
<p>A related problem is that the push towards protecting TK may create unreal 
expectations of benefit amongst the local population. To an extent, this has 
already started. For example, the popular magazine Island Business stated: &lsquo;If 
one were to evaluate commercial potential beginning from the metaphysics 
to blood cells and going out to cultural expressions, flora and fauna, Pacific 
Islanders are sitting on a gold mine. They just don&rsquo;t fully comprehend it yet.&rsquo;79

</p>
<p>Strathern similarly comments: &lsquo;Intellectual property has suddenly become a 
topic of widespread international interest. Moreover, once articulated it rapidly 
catches the public imagination, and this is something to be taken into account 
in policy development.&rsquo;80
</p>
<p>There is a need to make sure there are realistic expectations about the probably 
modest amount of profit that TK commercialisation is likely to bring, following 
commentators such as Dutfield who have cautioned: &lsquo;it is important not to over-
estimate the economic potential of TK&rsquo;.81 It is likely that envisaged gains will in 
no way be comparable to the cultural richness that could be lost by interfering 
with the current dynamic tradition of community-based exchange and use of TK.
</p>
<p>(d) The Problem of TK Already in the Public Domain
</p>
<p>A question that has not been clearly addressed by the Model Law is how to 
deal with the problem of TK that has already spread from its ancestral location 
(if such can be located) and is being used in various places within a country or 
even outside the Pacific Island countries.82 The people from the Fijian island of 
Beqa, for example, claim that the firewalking ceremony known as vilavilairevo 
belongs to them, and they have already started a campaign to get it back (that 
is, stop it being performed by other groups).83 If it can be established that they 
are the &lsquo;owners&rsquo; of the ceremony, the Model Law would require that no one 
else will be able to perform it without the consent of the Beqa people.84 The 
effect of this (and similar situations) on the livelihood of countless tourist-based 
businesses throughout the Pacific, and the fierce disputes it would engender, 
are disturbing to contemplate. The only gain may be that preparing court cases 
will be a very good way of revitalising traditional knowledge, as exemplified 
by the &lsquo;Sawau Project&rsquo;, which was established to document the process and 
demonstrate its origin in Beqa.

82 It could be argued that attempting to regulate this is like trying to shut the paddock gate after the horse 
has bolted, although the example of the recent success some European countries have had in re-gaining 
protection for commodities such as cheese and wine through the movement for GIs and appellations of origin 
may contradict this. However, to achieve such successes, significant economic bargaining power is required.

84 Section 3 of the Model Law provides that it applies to TK that was in existence before the commencement 
of the Act.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9 . Do You Want it Gift Wrapped?
</p>
<p>209
</p>
<p>In Palau this issue is dealt with in the TK Bill by requiring all pre-existing non-
customary uses to be registered with the relevant Ministry within 180 days of 
the legislation taking effect. Then, commencing one year after the legislation 
has been in force, users of such TK are required to attach a label to objects that 
embody the TK, stating, &lsquo;This product includes elements of Palauan traditional 
knowledge or expressions of culture which have been used without the express 
guidance or approval of the traditional owner&rsquo; or to make a speech at the start 
of a performance to the same effect.85 It can be imagined how unpalatable this 
would be to the local tourist industry, and could be the reason the Bill has not 
as yet been promulgated.
</p>
<p>(e) Stifling of Internal Research, Use and 
Development of TK by TK Owners Themselves
</p>
<p>One of the greatest dangers is that the legislation and associated initiatives could 
impede the current dynamic exchange and development of TK. There is a risk 
that such an initiative will foster a commercialisation mentality in which people 
seek to guard &lsquo;their&rsquo; TK in order to profit from it in the cash economy. Dutfield 
observes that &lsquo;modern IPR [intellectual property rights] reflect, but also help to 
underpin (through the rewards they provide) a highly competitive winner-take-
all business ethos&rsquo;,86 and similar concerns arise in respect of the Model Law&rsquo;s 
determination of ownership by finite groups of people. Once again, the parallels 
with the social problems following the leasing of customary land and resources 
development in Melanesia are only too apparent. As mentioned above, if the 
free movement of TK between communities is impeded, this will diminish the 
cultural richness of the society as a whole and impede the evolution of TK. It 
is likely also to have negative impacts upon many aspects of people&rsquo;s livelihood 
which depend on the use of TK, such as primary health care and agriculture.87
</p>
<p>The legislation could also have a curtailing effect on research that is currently 
being conducted by both indigenous researchers and foreign scholars. For 
example, the Vanuatu Fieldworkers, a network of indigenous researchers 
established by the Vanuatu Cultural Centre, conduct research on a different 
aspect of TK within their own communities each year.88 If they are required to 
comply with the formalities of the legislation (and there is no reason why they 
should not, as conducting research is not a &lsquo;customary use&rsquo;), then this is likely 
</p>

87 Ibid, 142-143. Dutfield notes that the WHO has stated that 80 per cent of the world&rsquo;s population depends 
on traditional medicine for its primary healthcare and that TK is indispensable for its survival.

</p>
<p>210
</p>
<p>to have a stifling effect on this important initiative. Surely the most important 
aim of any TK initiative is to keep TK alive, and so any procedures that make it 
more difficult for local people to use it should be avoided? How can communities 
share TK and learn and innovate if they are always up against a state authority? 
Although it may be argued that the law will be only selectively enforced, and 
so groups such as the Vanuatu Fieldworkers would not be in danger, this is not 
satisfactory for a variety of reasons, including the fact that criminal sanctions 
may possibly be involved.89
</p>
<p>One of the particular problems in this regard is the enormously wide scope of 
the legislation: it aims to cover every conceivable type of TK and to provide 
rights over it in perpetuity. Whilst such an approach makes sense for certain 
types of TK, such as secret or sacred material, it appears unduly restrictive 
overall. A different approach is suggested by Dutfield, who states:
</p>
<p>Ideally the protectable subject matter should be defined in close 
consultation with the purported beneficiaries. Also, the broader the 
definition of TK, the more the rights provided should be limited in some 
way or another &hellip; to treat all conceivable categories of TK as deserving 
strong and/or permanent protection is unreasonable and would almost 
certainly go beyond what customary law indicates anyway.90
</p>
<p>In carrying out such a consultation, views of authors such as Boyle who 
demonstrate the importance of a wide public domain to generate new works 
should also be shared.91 There is no reason why the careful balancing of rights of 
users and rights of the public that lies at the heart of Western-style intellectual 
property protection should not also be of relevance in the context of TK. One 
possible way of avoiding some of the identified dangers would be to extend the 
moral rights provisions to commercial and non-commercial use, but otherwise 
to tailor the provisions much more narrowly to meet specific objectives, such as 
preventing one person gaining a commercial advantage at the expense of others.
</p>
<p>5. What Would a True Deep Pluralistic 
Approach Look Like?
</p>
<p>A review of the international literature on TK protection does not currently 
provide a shining example of a national model of protection based on respect 
and support for customary norms and institutions. Much of the literature is 
contextualised within an indigenous rights narrative wherein the indigenous

</p>
<p>population is currently suppressed by a dominant other &mdash; but this is not the 
case in Pacific Island countries. Given this rare ability to exercise rights from a 
position of power,92 the Pacific Island countries have a degree of liberty to shape 
a new approach to protection of TK that other indigenous groups may follow. Of 
course, this liberty is likely to be reduced as a result of multilateral and bilateral 
trade negotiations currently underway.93 The aim of this section is to outline a 
particular path that may be followed to arrive at such a model of protection.
</p>
<p>A true pluralist approach to the protection of TK would follow a bottom-up 
process, and would emerge following widespread consultations with community 
and customary leaders as a first step. This approach has the support of a recent 
global study into protecting and promoting TK, the editors of which state: &lsquo;There 
is general consensus that new approaches and measures (sui generis systems) that 
combine tools in an appropriate way need to be developed for the protection of 
TK at the national and international levels &hellip; These systems should be developed 
in close consultation with indigenous and local communities.&rsquo;94 The benefits of 
such an approach appear self-evident, but to date this step has been neglected 
in most TK initiatives around the world. Thus Dutfield comments on &lsquo;how rare 
it is for indigenous peoples and local communities to be consulted about new 
[TK] legislation&rsquo;.95 This consultation would address a number of preliminary 
questions such as the desire and need for greater protection of TK, and the types 
of support existing customary institutions require to meet the needs identified.
</p>
<p>As the substantive composition of the legal framework to emerge from such 
consultations cannot be known until those consultations have occurred, it is 
not possible to pre-empt it in any great detail. It is, however, possible to discuss 
and describe some of the principles that are likely to underpin any development 
emerging from such a process.
</p>
<p>(a) Customary Institutions Supported and Strengthened
</p>
<p>The empowering of customary institutions and leaders to develop their processes 
and norms for regulating use of TK, both within and without their community, 
is likely to be central to any new protection system. Thus Solomon argues in the 
context of Māori laws: &lsquo;First priority needs to be given to strengthening and 
protecting customary law systems, because of the important values inherent in 
those systems, which are critical to the maintenance of the cultures concerned.&rsquo;96

<p>Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; Innovation
</p>
<p>212
</p>
<p>Such a model would involve a decentralised, locally based decision-making 
structure with responsibility for determining questions of access and equitable 
benefit sharing, rather than a state-centred one as envisaged in the Model Law. 
Swiderska, in her work with the International Institute for Development, argues:
</p>
<p>The best way for communities to protect their knowledge and resources 
is at local level. Community-based natural resource management, 
together with secure land-tenure, can strengthen community control 
of TK and natural resources, maintain traditional knowledge, conserve 
biodiversity and improve livelihoods.
</p>
<p>She gives the example of the community-based Andean Potato Park that uses 
customary principles of reciprocity, equilibrium and duality to guide the 
management of the park at the local level.97 Peter &Oslash;rebech similarly argues that 
customs that develop customary law systems &lsquo;play a critical role in achieving 
viable social systems&rsquo;.98
</p>
<p>As part of this process it will be necessary to create space for discussions 
with customary leaders about the competing aims of conservation and 
commercialisation, and developing processes that are able to mediate between 
these different demands while retaining key cultural principles. This is best 
done by creating a dialogue that seeks to facilitate an informed engagement 
with the issues, and avoids using the language of &lsquo;theft&rsquo; and &lsquo;ownership&rsquo;. 
Pacific Islanders are extremely inventive, and many of their customary leaders 
are very wise and informed by deep understandings of their communities and 
the forces at play within them. There is therefore every chance that, given the 
opportunity, they will come up with solutions unexpected to an outsider but 
which will work for their community. For example, Geismar has illustrated how, 
through a judicious use of traditional beliefs and practices, a group of men from 
North Ambrym ensured that the market in carved wooden gongs (tam-tams) for 
which they are famous has remained effectively in their hands.99
</p>
<p>(b) Minimal State Intervention
</p>
<p>The state does have an important role to play in a truly pluralistic protection 
model, but it is as an advisor and facilitator, and not as a primary regulator. 
There are many useful functions the state can have, especially in regard to 
mediating between its citizens and outsiders who wish to use TK. The state may 
also need to develop processes by which it can assist local customary authorities 
in enforcing any decisions they have made concerning TK. In addition, it may

</p>
<p>also work on initiatives such as developing systems of certification marks for 
different communities. It also has an important role in small island states as 
a gatekeeper, making sure that the activities of researchers and developers 
are monitored and opportunities for exploitation minimised &mdash; for example, 
through a system of research permits as currently operate in Vanuatu and Fiji. 
Finally, the state could ensure that its import rules forbid the importation of 
goods embodying the TK of the country, thus ensuring that only citizens of the 
country can profit from making such objects.100
</p>
<p>(c) Diffuse Benefit Sharing from Use of TK
</p>
<p>A pluralist approach would encourage the benefits from TK being spread among 
as many communities and individuals as possible. This would be done by 
promoting the spirit of communal benefit that underlies TK in the Pacific Islands 
as a whole. For example, a land dispute in Vanuatu may traditionally have been 
resolved by allowing the &lsquo;losing&rsquo; party to remain on a part of the land that was 
under contestation, whereas a court-adjudicated approach would require the 
winner to take all.101 A similar approach is advocated by Swiderska, who argues 
that: &lsquo;Given that TK and genetic resources are often shared freely between 
communities, even across borders, collective rights, decision-making and 
benefit-sharing amongst neighbouring communities should be recognised.&rsquo;102
</p>
<p>(d) Promoting the Use of TK by Local Communities
</p>
<p>A central aim of a pluralist approach to protection is to facilitate access by local 
communities to their own TK, and to the TK of neighbouring communities, 
in accordance with reciprocal customary obligations. Any expensive or 
bureaucratic process that may work as an impediment to this should be avoided. 
The primary aim should be to use TK to improve the livelihoods of TK holders 
and communities through contributing to a rich cultural life, ecologically sound 
agricultural practices and primary health care. This approach is similar to that 
of the &lsquo;traditional economy&rsquo; advocated by Vanuatu MP Regenvanu, who argues 
that it is constantly overlooked by policy-makers but has in fact been the major 
source of resilience for Melanesian populations for thousands of years.103
</p>
<p>100 For example, if tam-tams were being made in Bali and shipped back to Vanuatu for sale in the tourist 
market, this would be prohibited by such restrictions.
101 Regenvanu states that in the traditional Melanesian economy &lsquo;everyone has access to land on which to 
make gardens for food and access resources, even people with no traditional claim over the land being used. 
However, the ill-considered alienation of land from the traditional economy in Vanuatu through leasehold 
titles, for example, is removing the means for ordinary people to be economically productive and enjoy food 
and social security.&rsquo; Regenvanu, above n 26, 5.

<p>6. Conclusion
</p>
<p>The aim of this chapter has been to suggest that the current move to protect TK 
in the Pacific Island countries is taking a wrong direction in giving the state 
such a central role, and in prioritising the commercialisation of TK over use of 
TK by local communities. The brakes need to be applied and a deeper reflection 
made into the issues through a process of widespread community consultation. 
The current initiative is proceeding as if TK is terra nullius, whereas in fact each 
country in the region has a sophisticated customary legal system in which TK 
is deeply embedded. This chapter suggests that the first step in any move to 
protect TK should be to enquire into this system, and to see if and how it could 
be empowered to meet the new challenges posed to TK by globalisation. One 
significant advantage of doing this is that it will also support the underlying 
social and economic structures that produce TK. On the other hand, a failure to 
do so may very well risk undermining the customary structures that have led to 
the extraordinary wealth of TK in the region in the first place.</p>
