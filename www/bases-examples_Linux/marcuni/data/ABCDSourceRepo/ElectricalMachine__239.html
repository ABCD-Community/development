<p>Preface
</p>
<p>This textbook is intended for undergraduate students of Electrical Engineering as
</p>
<p>their first course in electrical machines. It is also recommended for students prepar-
</p>
<p>ing a capstone project, where they need to understand, model, supply, control and
</p>
<p>specify electric machines. At the same time, it can be used as a valuable reference for
</p>
<p>other engineering disciplines involved with electrical motors and generators. It is
</p>
<p>also suggested to postgraduates and engineers aspiring to electromechanical energy
</p>
<p>conversion and having to deal with electrical drives and electrical power generation.
</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of textbooks on electrical machines, this book does not require
</p>
<p>an advanced background. An effort was made to provide text approachable to
</p>
<p>students and engineers, in engineering disciplines other than electrical.
</p>
<p>The scope of this textbook provides basic knowledge and skills in Electrical
</p>
<p>Machines that should be acquired by prospective engineers. Basic engineering
</p>
<p>considerations are used to introduce principles of electromechanical energy con-
</p>
<p>version in an intuitive manner, easy to recall and repeat. The book prepares the
</p>
<p>reader to comprehend key electrical and mechanical properties of electrical
</p>
<p>machines, to analyze their steady state and transient characteristics, to obtain
</p>
<p>basic notions on conversion losses, efficiency and cooling of electrical machines,
</p>
<p>to evaluate a safe operating area in a steady state and during transient states, to
</p>
<p>understand power supply requirements and associated static power converters, to
</p>
<p>comprehend some basic differences between DCmachines, induction machines and
</p>
<p>synchronous machines, and to foresee some typical applications of electrical
</p>
<p>motors and generators.
</p>
<p>Developing knowledge on electrical machines and acquiring requisite skills is
</p>
<p>best suited for second year engineering students. The book is self-contained and it
</p>
<p>includes questions, answers, and solutions to problems wherever the learning
</p>
<p>process requires an overview. Each Chapter is comprised of an appropriate set of
</p>
<p>exercises, problems and design tasks, arranged for recall and use of relevant
</p>
<p>knowledge. Wherever it is needed, the book includes extended reminders and
</p>
<p>explanations of the required skill and prerequisites. The approach and method
</p>
<p>used in this textbook comes from the sixteen years of author&rsquo;s experience in
</p>
<p>teaching Electrical Machines at the University of Belgrade.

</p>
<p>undergraduates as their first course in electrical machines. It is also suggested to
</p>
<p>postgraduates of all Engineering disciplines that plan to major in electrical drives,
</p>
<p>renewables, and other areas that involve electromechanical conversions. The book
</p>
<p>is recommended to students that prepare capstone project that involves electrical
</p>

</p>
<p>electrical motors and generators.
</p>
<p>Prerequisites
</p>
<p>Required background includes mathematics, physics, and engineering fundamentals
</p>
<p>taught in introductory semesters of most contemporary engineering curricula. The
</p>
<p>process of developing skills and knowledge on electrical machines is best suited for
</p>
<p>second year engineering students. Prerequisites do not include spatial derivatives
</p>
<p>and field theory. This textbook is made accessible to readers without an advanced
</p>
<p>background in electromagnetics, circuit theory, mathematics and engineering
</p>
<p>materials. Necessary background includes elementary electrostatics and magnetics,
</p>
<p>DC andAC current circuits and elementary skill with complex numbers and phasors.
</p>
<p>An effort is made to bring the text closer to students and engineers in engineering
</p>
<p>disciplines other than electrical. Wherever it is needed, the book includes extended
</p>
<p>reinstatements and explanations of the required skill and prerequisites. Required
</p>
<p>fundamentals are recalled and included in the book to the extent necessary for
</p>
<p>understanding the analysis and developments.
</p>
<p>Objectives
</p>
<p>&bull; Using basic engineering considerations to introduce principles of electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical energy conversion and basic types and applications of electrical
</p>
<p>machines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Providing basic knowledge and skills in electrical machines that should be
</p>
<p>acquired by prospective engineers. Comprehending key electrical and mechani-
</p>
<p>cal properties of electrical machines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Providing and easy to use reference for engineers in general.
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquiring skills in analyzing steady state and transient characteristics of electri-
</p>
<p>cal machines, as well as acquiring basic notions on conversion losses, efficiency
</p>
<p>and heat removal in electrical machines.
</p>
<p>vi Preface</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Mastering mechanical characteristics and steady state equivalent circuits for
</p>
<p>principal types of electrical machines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Comprehending basic differences between DC machines, induction machines
</p>
<p>and synchronous machines, studying and comparing their steady state operating
</p>
<p>area and transient operating area.
</p>
<p>&bull; Studying and apprehending characteristics of mains supplied and variable fre-
</p>
<p>quency supplied AC machines, comparing their characteristics and considering
</p>
<p>their typical applications.
</p>
<p>&bull; Understanding power supply requirements and studying basic topologies and
</p>
<p>characteristics of associated static power converters.
</p>
<p>&bull; Studying field weakening operation and analyzing characteristics of DC and AC
</p>
<p>machines in constant flux region and in the constant power region.
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquiring skills in calculating conversion losses, temperature increase and
</p>
<p>cooling methods. Basic information on thermal models and intermittent loading.
</p>
<p>&bull; Introducing and explaining the rated and nominal currents, voltages, flux
</p>
<p>linkages, torque, power and speed.
</p>
<p>Teaching approach
</p>
<p>&bull; The emphasis is on the system overview - explaining external characteristics of
</p>
<p>electrical machines - their electrical and mechanical access. Design and con-
</p>
<p>struction aspects are of secondary importance or out of the scope of this book.
</p>
<p>&bull; Where needed, introductory parts of teaching units comprise repetition of the
</p>
<p>required background which is applied through solved problems.
</p>
<p>&bull; Mathematics is reduced to a necessary minimum. Spatial derivatives and differ-
</p>
<p>ential form of Maxwell equations are not required.
</p>
<p>&bull; The goal of developing and using mathematical models of electrical machines,
</p>
<p>their equivalent circuits and mechanical characteristics persists through the
</p>
<p>book. At the same time, the focus is kept on physical insight of electromechani-
</p>
<p>cal conversion process. The later is required for proper understanding of conver-
</p>
<p>sion losses and perceiving the basic notions on specific power, specific torque,
</p>
<p>and torque-per-Ampere ratio of typical machines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Although machine design is out of the overall scope, some most relevant
</p>
<p>concepts and skills in estimating the machine size, torque, power, inertia and
</p>
<p>losses are introduced and explained. The book also explains some secondary
</p>
<p>losses and secondary effects, indicating the cases and conditions where the
</p>
<p>secondary phenomena cannot be neglected.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Field of application
</p>
<p>Equivalent circuits, dynamic models and mechanical characteristics are given for
</p>
<p>DC machines, induction machines and synchronous machines. The book outlines
</p>
<p>the basic information on the machine construction, including the magnetic circuits
</p>
<p>and windings. Thorough approach to designing electric machines is left out of the
</p>
<p>book. Within the book, machine applications are divided in two groups; (i) Constant
</p>
<p>voltage, constant frequency supplied machines, and (ii) Variable voltage, variable
</p>
<p>frequency machines fed from static power converters. A number of most important
</p>
<p>details on designing electric machines for constant frequency and variable fre-
</p>
<p>quency operation are included. The book outlines basic static power converter
</p>
<p>topologies used in electrical drives with DC and AC machines. The book also
</p>
<p>provides basic information on loses, heating and cooling methods, on rated and
</p>
<p>nominal quantities, and on continuous and intermittent loading. For most common
</p>
<p>machines, the book provides and explains the steady state operating area and the
</p>
<p>transient operating area, the area in constant flux and field weakening range.

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>This chapter provides introduction to electromechanical energy conversion and
</p>
<p>rotating power converters. This chapter explains the role of electrical machines in
</p>
<p>electrical power systems, industry applications, and commercial and residential
</p>
<p>area and supports the need to study electrical machines and acquire skills in their
</p>
<p>modeling, supplying, and control. This chapter also discusses notation and system
</p>
<p>of units used throughout this book, specifies target knowledge and skills to be
</p>
<p>acquired, and explains prerequisites. This chapter concludes with remarks on
</p>
<p>further studies.
</p>
<p>1.1 Power Converters and Electrical Machines
</p>
<p>Electrical machines are power converters, devices that convert energy from one
</p>
<p>form into another. They convert mechanical work into electrical energy or vice
</p>
<p>versa. There are also power converters that convert electrical energy of one form
</p>
<p>into electrical energy of another form. They are called static power converters.
</p>
<p>Some sample power converters are listed below:
</p>
<p>&bull; Power converters that generate mechanical work by using electrical energy are
</p>
<p>called electrical motors. Electrical motors are electrical machines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Power converters that use the electrical energy of direct currents and voltages
</p>
<p>and convert this energy into electrical energy of AC currents and voltages are
</p>
<p>called inverters. Inverters belong to static power converters, and they make use
</p>
<p>of semiconductor power switches.
</p>
<p>&bull; Electrical generators convert mechanical work into electrical energy. They
</p>
<p>belong to electrical machines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Power transformers convert (transform) electrical energy from one system of AC
</p>
<p>voltages into electrical energy of another system of AC voltages, wherein the
</p>
<p>two AC systems have the same frequency.

<p>1.1.1 Rotating Power Converters
</p>
<p>Electrical machines converting electrical energy to mechanical work are called
</p>
<p>electrical motors. Electrical machines converting mechanical work to electrical
</p>
<p>energy are called electrical generators. Mechanical energy usually appears in the
</p>
<p>form of a rotational movement; thus, electrical motors and generators are called
</p>
<p>rotational power converters or rotating electrical machines. The process of
</p>
<p>converting electrical energy to mechanical work is called electromechanical con-
</p>
<p>version. Different from rotational converters, power transformers are electrical
</p>
<p>machines which have no moving parts and convert electrical power of one system
</p>
<p>of AC voltages and currents into another AC system. The two AC systems have the
</p>
<p>same frequency, but their voltage levels are different due to transformation. This
</p>
<p>book deals with the rotating electrical machines, electrical generators and motors,
</p>
<p>whereas power transformers are dealt with by other textbooks.
</p>
<p>Electrical machines comprise current circuits made of insulated conductors and
</p>
<p>magnetic circuits made of ferromagnetic materials. The machines produce mechan-
</p>
<p>ical work due to the action of electromagnetic forces on conductors and ferro-
</p>
<p>magnetics coupled by a magnetic field. Conductors and ferromagnetic elements
</p>
<p>belong either to the moving part of the machine (rotor) or to the stationary part
</p>
<p>(stator). Rotation of the machine moving part contributes to variation of the mag-
</p>
<p>netic field. In turn, an electromotive force is induced in the conductors, which allows
</p>
<p>generation of electrical energy. Similarly, electrical current in the machine
</p>
<p>conductors, called windings, interacts with the magnetic field and produces the
</p>
<p>forces that excite the rotor motion. Unlike electrical machines, the power
</p>
<p>transformers do not involve moving parts. Their operation is based on electromag-
</p>
<p>netic coupling between the primary and secondary windings encircling the same
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit.
</p>
<p>1.1.2 Static Power Converters
</p>
<p>In addition to electrical machines and power transformers, there are power
</p>
<p>converters whose operation is not based on electromagnetic coupling of current
</p>
<p>circuits and magnetic circuit. The converters containing semiconductor power
</p>
<p>switches are known as static power converters or power electronics devices. One
</p>
<p>such example is a diode rectifier, containing four power diodes connected into a
</p>
<p>bridge. Supplied by an AC voltage, diode rectifier outputs a pulsating DC voltage.
</p>
<p>Therefore, a diode rectifier carries out conversion of AC electrical energy into DC
</p>
<p>electrical energy. Conversion of DC electrical energy into AC electrical energy is
</p>
<p>carried out by inverters, static power converters containing semiconductor power
</p>
<p>switches like power transistors or power thyristors. Static power converters are
</p>
<p>frequently used in conjunction with electrical machines, but they are not studied
</p>
<p>within this book.

<p>1.1.3 The Role of Electromechanical Power Conversion
</p>
<p>Electromechanical conversion has a key role in production and uses of electrical
</p>
<p>energy. Electrical generators produce electrical energy, whereas motors are the
</p>
<p>consumers converting a considerable portion of electrical energy into mechanical
</p>
<p>work, required by production processes, transportation, lighting, and other indus-
</p>
<p>trial, residential, and household applications. Thanks to electromechanical conver-
</p>
<p>sion, energy is transported and delivered to remote consumers by means of
</p>
<p>electrical conductors. Electrical transmission is very reliable, it is not accompanied
</p>
<p>by emissions of gasses or other harmful substances, and it is carried out with low
</p>
<p>energy losses.
</p>
<p>In electrical power plants, steam and water turbines produce mechanical work
</p>
<p>which is delivered to electrical generators. Through the processes taking place
</p>
<p>within a generator, the mechanical work is converted into electrical energy,
</p>
<p>which is available at generator terminals in the form of AC currents and voltages.
</p>
<p>High-voltage power lines transmit electrical energy to industrial centers and
</p>
<p>communities where power cables and lines of the distribution network provide
</p>
<p>the power supply to various consumers situated in production halls, transportation
</p>
<p>units, offices, and households. In the course of transmission and distribution, the
</p>
<p>voltage is transformed several times by using power transformers. Electrical
</p>
<p>generators, electrical motors, and power transformers are vital components of an
</p>
<p>electrical power system.
</p>
<p>1.1.4 Principles of Operation
</p>
<p>Electromechanical energy conversion can be accomplished by applying various
</p>
<p>principles of physics. Operation of electrical machines is usually based on the
</p>
<p>magnetic field which couples current-carrying circuits and moving parts of
</p>
<p>the machine. The conductors and ferromagnetic parts in the coupling magnetic
</p>
<p>field are subjected to electromagnetic forces. Conductors form contours and circuits
</p>
<p>carrying electrical currents. Flux linkage in a contour (called flux) can change due to
</p>
<p>changes in electrical current or due to motion. Flux change induces electromotive
</p>
<p>force in contours. The basic laws of physics determining electromechanical energy
</p>
<p>conversion in electrical machines with magnetic coupling field are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Faraday law of electromagnetic induction, which defines the relationship
</p>
<p>between a changing magnetic flux and induced electromotive force
</p>
<p>&bull; Ampère law, which describes magnetic field of conductors carrying electrical
</p>
<p>current
</p>
<p>&bull; Lorentz law, which determines the force acting on moving charges in magnetic
</p>
<p>and electrical fields
</p>
<p>&bull; Kirchhoff laws, which give relations between voltages and currents in current
</p>
<p>circuits and also between fluxes and magnetomotive forces in magnetic circuits
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.1.5 Magnetic and Current Circuits
</p>
<p>The process of electromechanical energy conversion in electrical machines is
</p>
<p>based on interaction between the magnetic coupling field and conductors carrying
</p>
<p>electrical currents. Magnetic flux is channeled through magnetic circuits made of
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic materials. Electrical currents are directed through current conductors.
</p>
<p>Magnetic circuits are formed by stacking iron sheets separated by thin insulation
</p>
<p>layers, while current circuits are made of insulated copper conductors. The three
</p>
<p>most important types of electrical machines, DC current machines, asynchronous
</p>
<p>machines, and synchronous machines are of different constructions, and they use
</p>
<p>different ways of establishing magnetic fields and currents. Rotating electrical
</p>
<p>machines have a nonmoving part, stator, and a moving part, rotor, which can rotate
</p>
<p>around machine axis. The magnetic and current circuits could be mounted on both
</p>
<p>stator and rotor. In addition to the magnetic and current circuits, electrical machines
</p>
<p>also have other parts, like housing, shaft, bearings, and terminals of current circuits.
</p>
<p>1.1.6 Rotating Electrical Machines
</p>
<p>Mechanical work of electrical machines can be related to rotation or translation.
</p>
<p>Majority of electrical machines is made of rotating electromechanical converters
</p>
<p>producing rotational movement and having cylindrical rotors, like the one shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1. Electrical machines creating linear movement are called linear motors.
</p>
<p>Linear motors are rather rare.
</p>
<p>Current circuits of a machine are called windings. They can be connected to
</p>
<p>external electrical sources or to electrical energy consumers. The ends of the winding
</p>
<p>are accessible as electrical terminals. In Fig. 1.1, terminals of kth winding are denoted
</p>
<p>by letters A and B. The electrical terminals permit electrical access to the machine.
</p>
<p>Since electrical machines perform electromechanical conversion, they have both
</p>
<p>electrical and mechanical accesses. Via electrical terminals, the machine can receive
</p>
<p>electrical energy from external sources or supply electrical energy to consumers in
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 Rotating electrical machine has cylindrical rotor, accessible via shaft. Stator has the form
of a hollow cylinder, coaxial with the rotor
</p>
<p>4 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the circuits which are external to the machine. When an electrical machine has N
</p>
<p>windings, the power at electrical access of the machine is given by (1.1):
</p>
<p>pe &frac14;
XN
</p>
<p>k&frac14;1
ukik: (1.1)
</p>
<p>Rotor is positioned inside a hollow cylindrical stator. Along rotor axis is a steel
</p>
<p>shaft, accessible at machine ends. Angular frequency of revolution of the rotor is
</p>
<p>also called the rotor speed, and it is denoted by Om. At one end of the shaft, shown
</p>
<p>on the right of Fig. 1.1, the electrical machine can deliver or receive mechanical
</p>
<p>work. The shaft makes mechanical terminal of the machine. It transmits rotational
</p>
<p>torque or simply torque of the machine to external sources or consumers of
</p>
<p>mechanical work. The torque Tem in Fig. 1.1 is created by the interaction of the
</p>
<p>magnetic field and electrical current. Therefore, it is also called electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque. In cases when the torque contributes to motion and acts toward the speed
</p>
<p>increase, it is called driving torque.
</p>
<p>An electrical motor converts electrical energy to mechanical work. The later is
</p>
<p>delivered via shaft to a machine operating as a mechanical load, also called work
</p>
<p>machine. The motor acts on the work machine through the torque Tem, while the
</p>
<p>work machine opposes the rotation by the load torque Tm. In the case when
</p>
<p>the driving and load torques are equal, angular frequency of the rotation Om does
</p>
<p>not change. Power delivered to a work machine by the electrical motor is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the product of the torque and speed:
</p>
<p>pm &frac14; OmTm: (1.2)
</p>
<p>An electrical generator converts mechanical work to electrical energy. It receives
</p>
<p>the mechanical work from a water or steam turbine; thus, power pm has a negative
</p>
<p>value. Rotational torque of the turbine Tm tends to set the rotor into motion, whereas
</p>
<p>the torque Tem, generated by the electrical machine, opposes this movement.
</p>
<p>By adopting reference directions shown in the right-hand side of Fig. 1.1, both Tem
and Tm have negative values. Variable pe, given by relation (1.1), defines the
</p>
<p>electrical power taken by the machine from external electrical circuits, i.e.,
</p>
<p>the power taken from a supply network. Since electrical generator converts mechan-
</p>
<p>ical work to electrical energy and delivers it to a supply network, the generator
</p>
<p>power pe has a negative value. The sign of these variables has to do with reference
</p>
<p>directions. Changing the reference directions for torques and currents in Fig. 1.1
</p>
<p>would result in positive generator torques and positive generator power.
</p>
<p>1.1.7 Reversible Machines
</p>
<p>Electrical machines are mainly reversible. A reversible electrical machine may
</p>
<p>operate either as a generator converting mechanical work to electrical energy or as
</p>
<p>a motor converting electrical energy to mechanical work. Transition from the
</p>
<p>1.1 Power Converters and Electrical Machines 5</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>generator to motor operating mode is accompanied by changes in the electrical and
</p>
<p>mechanical variables such as voltage, current, torque, and speed. The operating
</p>
<p>mode can be changed without modifications in the machine construction, with no
</p>
<p>changes in the current circuits, and without variations in the shaft coupling between
</p>
<p>the electrical machine and the work machine. An example of a reversible electrical
</p>
<p>machine is asynchronous motor. At angular rotor speeds lower than the synchro-
</p>
<p>nous speed, an asynchronous machine operates in the motor mode. If the speed is
</p>
<p>increased above the synchronous speed, the electromagnetic torque is opposed to
</p>
<p>motion while asynchronous machine converts mechanical work to electrical
</p>
<p>energy, thus operating in the generator mode.
</p>
<p>Reversible energy conversion is shown in Fig. 1.2. Direction from left to right is
</p>
<p>taken as the reference direction for the power and energy flow. Power pe at the
</p>
<p>electrical and pm at the mechanical terminal of the machine have positive values in
</p>
<p>the motor mode, whereas in the generator mode these values are negative. Energy
</p>
<p>conversion is accompanied by energy losses in the current circuits, magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits, and also mechanical energy losses as a consequence of various forms of
</p>
<p>rotational friction. Due to losses, the power values at the electrical and mechanical
</p>
<p>terminals are not equal. In the motor mode, the obtained mechanical power pm is
</p>
<p>somewhat lower than the invested electrical power pe due to conversion losses.
</p>
<p>In the generator mode, the obtained electrical power (�pe) is somewhat lower than
the invested mechanical power (�pm) because of the losses.
</p>
<p>1.2 Significance and Typical Applications
</p>
<p>Electrical energy is produced by operation of electrical generators. The produced
</p>
<p>energy is transmitted and distributed to energy consumers, mainly consisting of electri-
</p>
<p>cal motors which create controlled movement in work machines, whether household

<p>appliances, industry automation machines, robots, electrical vehicles, or machines
</p>
<p>in transportation systems.
</p>
<p>The role of electrical machines in the processes and phases of production,
</p>
<p>transmission, distribution, and application of electrical energy is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.3. A brief description is given for each individual phase:
</p>
<p>(a) Electrical energy can be obtained by using the potential energy of water
</p>
<p>accumulated in lakes; by using energy of coal, natural gas, or other fossil
</p>
<p>fuels; by using wind and tidal energy; by using nuclear fission, heat of under-
</p>
<p>ground waters, and energy of the sun; and by other means. These resources are
</p>
<p>the primary energy sources.
</p>
<p>(b) In electrical power plants, the primary energy is at first converted to mechanical
</p>
<p>work. By burning fossil fuels, or using thermal springs, or in a nuclear reactor,
</p>
<p>generated heat is used to evaporate water and produce overheated steam. The
</p>
<p>steam acts on the blades of a steam turbine which rotates at speed Om, creating
</p>
<p>rotational torque Tm. In hydroelectrical power plants, flow of water is directed
</p>
<p>to the blades of a hydroturbine. A turbine is also called primer mover.
</p>
<p>(c) The obtained mechanical power Pm &frac14; OmTm is delivered to electrical generator,
the electrical machine which converts mechanical work to electrical energy.
</p>
<p>(d) Synchronous machines from 0.5 to 1,000 MW are predominantly used as
</p>
<p>generators in electrical power plants. Stator of the generator has three stationary
</p>
<p>phase windings. The rotor accommodates an excitation winding which
</p>
<p>determines the rotor flux. This flux does not move with respect to the rotor.
</p>
<p>Since the rotor revolves, the magnetic field of the rotor rotates with respect to
</p>
<p>the stator windings. Therefore, the rotor motion causes variation of the flux in
</p>
<p>the stator phase windings. Due to variation of the flux, an electromotive force
</p>
<p>is induced in the stator phase windings. Consequently, an AC voltage u(t) is
</p>
<p>obtained at the stator winding terminals. When these terminals are connected to
</p>
<p>an external electrical circuit, AC currents i(t) are established in the stator phase
</p>
<p>windings. The machine is connected to a transmission network which takes the
</p>
<p>role of an electrical consumer. The AC currents in the phase windings are
</p>
<p>dependent on the electrical load connected to the generator via transmission
</p>
<p>network. Electrical power obtained at machine terminals is pe &frac14; &sum;ui. The
interaction of phase currents in the stator windings and magnetic field within
</p>
<p>the generator produces electromagnetic forces acting on the rotor which results
</p>
<p>in an electromagnetic torque Tem. This electromagnetic torque is a measure of
</p>
<p>mechanical interaction between the stator and the rotor. The electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque acts on both the rotor and the stator. The stator is fixed and cannot move.
</p>
<p>The rotor speed depends on the torque Tm, acting toward the speed increase, and
</p>
<p>the generator torque Tem, acting toward the speed decrease. In an electrical
</p>
<p>machine operating as a generator, the torque Tm is obtained by operation of
</p>
<p>the steam or a hydroturbine. This torque tends to start and accelerate the rotor.
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic torque Tem opposes the rotor movement. Mechanical
</p>
<p>power input is higher than the obtained electrical power due to power losses
</p>
<p>in the electrical machine. In addition to the losses within the generator itself,

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a part of the produced electrical energy is spent on covering consumption of the
</p>
<p>power plant itself. Contemporary electrical power plants are equipped with
</p>
<p>three-phase synchronous generators.1
</p>
<p>(e) The electrical power obtained at generator terminals is determined by the
</p>
<p>voltages and currents. The system of AC voltages at the stator terminals has
</p>
<p>the rms2 value from 6 to 25 kV, and frequency 50 Hz (60 Hz in some countries).
</p>
<p>A generator is connected to a block transformer, receiving the stator voltages on
</p>
<p>the primary side and providing the secondary side voltages compatible to the
</p>
<p>voltage level of the transmission power line.3 At present, these voltages range
</p>
<p>up to 750 kV, and introduction of voltages of 1,000 kV is being considered.
</p>
<p>(f) High-voltage power lines transmit electrical energy frompower plants to the cities,
</p>
<p>communities, industrial zones, and transportation nodes, wherever the consumers
</p>
<p>of electrical energy are grouped. Distribution of electrical energy is carried out by
</p>
<p>the lower voltage power lines. Factories and residential blocks are usually supplied
</p>
<p>by 10&ndash;20 kV power lines or cables. Power transformers 10 kV/0.4 kV reduce
</p>
<p>the line voltages to 400 V and phase voltage to 231 V, supplied to the majority
</p>
<p>of consumers. Transmission and distribution of electrical energy are accompanied
</p>
<p>by losses in power lines and also in the transmission and distribution power
</p>
<p>transformers.
</p>
<p>(g) Industrial consumers are using electrical motors for operating lathes, presses,
</p>
<p>rolling mills, milling machines, industrial robots, manipulators, conveyers,
</p>
<p>1At the end of nineteenth century, the production, transmission, distribution, and application of
</p>
<p>electrical energy were dealing with DC currents and voltages. Electrical power plantswere built in
</p>
<p>the centers of communities or close to industrial consumers, and they operated DC generators.
</p>
<p>Electrical motors were also DC machines. Both the production and application of electrical energy
</p>
<p>were relying on DCmachines, either as generators or as consumers &ndash; DCmotors. At the time, there
</p>
<p>were no power converters that would convert low DC voltage of the generator to a higher voltage
</p>
<p>which is more suitable for transmission. For this reason, energy transmission was carried out with
</p>
<p>high currents and considerable energy losses, proportional to the generator-load distance. Con-
</p>
<p>temporary transmission networks apply three-phase system of AC voltages. The voltage level is
</p>
<p>changed by means of power transformers. A block transformer transforms the generator voltages
</p>
<p>to the voltage level encountered at the transmission lines. A sequence of transmission and
</p>
<p>distribution transformers reduces the three-phase line voltage to the level of 400 V which is
</p>
<p>supplied to majority of three-phase consumers. The phase voltage of single-phase consumers
</p>
<p>is 231 V. By using the three-phase system of AC currents, it is possible to achieve transmission of
</p>
<p>electrical energy to distances of several hundreds of kilometers. Therefore, contemporary power
</p>
<p>plants could be distant from consumers.
2 &ldquo;Root mean square,&rdquo; the thermal equivalent of an AC current, the square root of the mean
</p>
<p>(average) current squared
3 In transmission of electrical energy by power lines over very large distances, greater than
</p>
<p>1,000 km, transmission by AC system of voltages and currents could be replaced by DC
</p>
<p>transmission, that is, by power lines operating with DC currents and voltages. At the beginning
</p>
<p>of a very long transmission line, static power converters are applied to transform energy of the AC
</p>
<p>system into the energy of the DC system. At the end of the line, there is a similar converter which
</p>
<p>converts the energy of the DC system into energy of the AC system. In this way, voltage drops
</p>
<p>across series impedances of the power line are reduced, and the power that could be transmitted is
</p>
<p>considerably increased.
</p>
<p>1.2 Significance and Typical Applications 9</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>mills, pumps for various fluids, ventilators, elevators, drills, forklifts, and other
</p>
<p>equipment and devices involved in production systems and processes.
</p>
<p>In electrical home appliances, motors are applied in air conditioners,
</p>
<p>refrigerators, washing and dishwashing machines, freezers, mixers, mills,
</p>
<p>blenders, record players, CD/DVD players, and computers and computer
</p>
<p>peripherals. Approximately 8% of the total electrical energy consumption is
</p>
<p>spent for supplying motors in transportation units like railway, city transport,
</p>
<p>and electrical cars.
</p>
<p>(h) In industrialized countries, 60&ndash;70% of the electrical energy production is
</p>
<p>consumed by electrical machines providing mechanical power and controlling
</p>
<p>motion in industry, traffic, offices, and homes. Therefore, it can be concluded
</p>
<p>that most of the electrical energy produced by generators is consumed by
</p>
<p>electrical motors which convert this energy to mechanical work. Electrical
</p>
<p>motors are coupled mechanically to machines handling mechanical work and
</p>
<p>power, carrying and transporting the goods, pumping fluids, or performing
</p>
<p>other useful operations. Most electrical motors draw the electric power from
</p>
<p>the three-phase distribution grid with line voltages of 400 V and line frequency
</p>
<p>of 50(60) Hz. If the speed of electrical motor has to be varied, it is necessary to
</p>
<p>use a static power converter between the motor terminals and the distribution
</p>
<p>grid. The static power converters are power electronics devices comprising
</p>
<p>semiconductor power switches. Their role is to convert the energy of line-
</p>
<p>frequency voltages and currents and to provide the motor supply voltages and
</p>
<p>currents with adjustable amplitude and frequency, suited to the motor needs.
</p>
<p>1.3 Variables and Relations of Rotational Movement
</p>
<p>Electrical machines are mainly rotating devices comprising a motionless stator
</p>
<p>which accommodates a cylindrical rotor. The rotor revolves around the axis
</p>
<p>which is common to both rotor and stator cylinders. Along this axis, the machine
</p>
<p>has a steel shaft serving for transmission of the produced mechanical work to an
</p>
<p>external work machine. There are also linear electrical machines wherein the
</p>
<p>moving part performs translation and is subject to forces instead of torques. Their
</p>
<p>use is restricted to solving particular problems in transportation and a relatively
</p>
<p>small number of applications in robotics.
</p>
<p>Position of rotor is denoted by ym, and this angle is expressed in radians. The first
derivative of the angle is mechanical speed of rotation, dym/dt &frac14; Om, expressed in
radians per second. Sign of Om depends on the adopted reference direction. It is
</p>
<p>adopted that positive direction of rotation is counterclockwise (CCW). Besides the
</p>
<p>rotor mechanical speed, this book also studies rotation of the magnetic field and
</p>
<p>rotation of other relevant electrical and magnetic quantities.
</p>
<p>Speed of rotation of each of the considered variables will be denoted by the
upper case Greek letter O, whereas the lower case Greek letter o will be reserved

<p>for denoting electrical angular frequency. Numerical values of the speed and
</p>
<p>frequency are usually expressed in terms of the SI system units, s�1, i.e., in radians
</p>
<p>per second. The value f &frac14; o/2p determines the frequency expressed as the number
of cycles per second, Hz. The rotor speed can also be expressed as the number of

</p>
<p>Torque Tem generated in an interaction of the magnetic field and the winding
currents is called electromagnetic torque. The electromagnetic torque produced by
</p>
<p>electric motors is also called moving torque or driving torque. Torque Tem is a
</p>
<p>measure of mechanical interaction between stator and rotor. A positive value of Tem
turns the rotor counterclockwise. The torque contribution of individual conductors
</p>
<p>is shown in Fig. 1.4. It is assumed in Fig. 1.4 that the field of magnetic induction B
</p>
<p>extends in horizontal direction. Electrical current in conductors interacts with the
</p>
<p>field and creates the force F which acts on the conductors in vertical direction.
</p>
<p>The force depends on the field strength, on the current amplitude, and on the length
</p>
<p>of conductors. The torque exerted on single conductor is determined by the product
</p>
<p>of the force F, acting on the conductor, and perpendicular distance of the vector F
</p>
<p>from the axis of rotation, also called the force arm. Figure 1.4 shows a contour
</p>
<p>subjected to the action of two coupled forces producing the torque Tem &frac14; FD,
where R &frac14; D/2 is the arm of the forces acting on conductors which are symmetri-
cally positioned with respect to the axis of rotation.
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic torque Tem is counteracted by the load torque Tm,
</p>
<p>representing the resistance of the mechanical load or work machine to the move-
</p>
<p>ment. In the case when the electromagnetic torque prevails, i.e., Tem &gt; Tm, the speed

<p>of rotation increases. Otherwise, it decreases. Variation of the speed of rotation is
</p>
<p>governed by Newton equation (1.4):
</p>
<p>J
dOm
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14; Ja &frac14; Tem � Tm: (1.4)
</p>
<p>Angular acceleration a &frac14; dOm/dt is expressed in radians per square second
[rad/s2] and can be calculated by Newton equation. In steady state, angular acceler-
</p>
<p>ation is equal to zero. Then, the electromagnetic torque Tem is in equilibrium with
</p>
<p>the load torque Tm.
</p>
<p>Moment of inertia J depends on the masses and shapes of all rotating parts.
In case of stiff coupling of the shaft of an electrical machine to rotational masses of
</p>
<p>a work machine, total moment of inertia J &frac14; JR + JRM is the sum of the rotor inertia
JR and inertia of rotating masses of the work machine JRM. Figure 1.5 shows a work
</p>
<p>machine coupled to an electrical motor. It is assumed that rotational masses of the
</p>
<p>machine have cylindrical shapes of radius R and mass m. Moment of inertia of a
</p>
<p>solid cylinder is determined by expression J &frac14; &frac12;mR2.
</p>
<p>Question (1.1): A work machine has rotational mass of the shape of a very thin
ring of radius R and mass m. Determine moment of inertia of the work machine.
</p>
<p>Answer (1.1): JRM &frac14; mR

<p>1.3.1 Notation and System of Units
</p>
<p>Throughout this book, instantaneous values of the considered variables are denoted
</p>
<p>by lower case letters (up, ip, pp &frac14; upip), whereas steady state values, DC values, and
root mean square values are denoted by upper case letters (Up, Ip, Pp &frac14; UpIp), in
accordance with recommendations of the International Electrotechnical Commis-
</p>
<p>sion (IEC). Exceptions to these recommendations are only notations of the force F,
</p>
<p>torque T, and speed of rotation O. Upper case letter T is used for denoting both
</p>
<p>instantaneous and steady state values of the torque since lower case letter t is often
</p>
<p>used to denote other relevant variables of power converters. Speed of rotation is
</p>
<p>denoted by the upper case Greek letter O, whereas lower case letter o denotes
</p>
<p>angular frequency. Both variables are expressed in radians per second, i.e., s�1.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Relevant vectors of rotating machines are represented in the cylindrical coordinate
</p>
<p>system. These are usually planar, since their z components are equal to zero.
</p>
<p>By introducing complex plane, each vector can be represented by a complex
</p>
<p>number with real and imaginary parts corresponding to the projections of the
</p>
<p>plane vector to the axes of the coordinate system.4 For example, voltage and current
</p>
<p>vectors are denoted by us and is. It should be noted that the stated quantities are not
</p>
<p>constants; thus, us and is are not voltage and current phasors. Namely, their real and
</p>
<p>imaginary parts can vary independently during transient processes. In steady state,
</p>
<p>quantities us and is, like other vectors represented in complex numbers, become
</p>
<p>complex constants and should be treated as phasors. In steady state, notation
</p>
<p>changes and becomes Us or Is. Stationary matrices can be denoted by [A] or A.
</p>
<p>All variables which can assume different numerical values are denoted by italic.
</p>
<p>Operators sin, cos, rot, div, mod, differentiating operator d, and others, as well as
</p>
<p>the measurement units, cannot be denoted by italic.
</p>
<p>Notation of vectors such as magnetic induction, magnetic field, force, and other
</p>
<p>vectors in equations is usual, ~B, ~H, ~F, etc. When these vectors are mentioned in the
text, the upper arrow is not used and the magnetic induction vector is denoted by B,
</p>
<p>magnetic field vector by H, force vector by F, etc.
</p>
<p>Within this book, coupled magnetic forces are called electromagnetic torque.
</p>
<p>In the introductory subjects of electrical engineering, forces acting on conductors in
</p>
<p>a magnetic field are called magnetic forces. The term magnetic torque is quite
</p>
<p>adequate, but the literature concerning electrical machines usually makes use of the
</p>
<p>term electromagnetic torque, so this term has been adopted in this book.
</p>
<p>International System of Units (SI), introduced in 1954, has been used in this
</p>
<p>book. The system has been introduced in most countries. A merit of the SI system is
</p>
<p>that it allows calculations with no need for using special scaling factors. Therefore,
</p>
<p>by applying the SI system, remembering and using dedicated multiplication
</p>
<p>coefficients are no longer needed. For example, calculation of work W made by
</p>
<p>force F, acting along path l, is obtained by multiplying the force and path.5 In the
</p>
<p>case of SI system, the work is determined by expressionW[J] &frac14; F[N]l[m], without
any need for introducing additional scaling coefficients because 1 J &frac14; 1 N � 1 m.
In the case when the force is expressed in kilograms, distance in inches or feet, the
</p>
<p>result Fl would have to be multiplied by a scaling factor in order to obtain the work
</p>
<p>in joules or calories. In the analysis of electrical machines, one should check
</p>
<p>whether the results are expressed in correct units. In doing so, it is useful to know
</p>
<p>relations between the basic and derived units. Some of the useful relations are

<p>4Representation of a plane vector by complex number is widely used in the technical literature
</p>
<p>concerning electrical machines. The vectors related to machine voltages and currents are also
</p>
<p>called space vector. Term polyphasor is also met. The complex notation is used here without any
</p>
<p>specific qualifier. A &ldquo;vector V,&rdquo; mentioned in the text, refers to the planar vector and implies that
</p>
<p>the unit vectors of the Cartesian coordinate system are formally replaced by the real and imaginary
</p>
<p>units.

</p>
<p>1.4 Target Knowledge and Skills
</p>
<p>Knowledge of electrical machines is a basis for successful activity of an electrical
</p>
<p>engineer. A large number of applications and systems, designed or used by an
</p>
<p>electrical engineer, contain one or more electrical machines. Characteristics of these
</p>
<p>applications and systems are usually determined by the performances of electrical
</p>
<p>machines, their dimensions, mass, efficiency, peak torque capability, and speed range,
</p>
<p>as well as control characteristics and dynamic response. For this reason, it is necessary
</p>
<p>to acquire the knowledge and skills to understand basic operation principles of
</p>
<p>electrical machines. Basic understanding of mechanical and electrical characteristics
</p>
<p>of electrical machines is required to specify and design their power supply and
</p>
<p>controls. The knowledge concerning the origin and nature of energy losses in electrical
</p>
<p>machines is required to specify and design their cooling and conceive their loss-
</p>
<p>minimized use.
</p>
<p>The most significant challenges in developing novel solutions are design of the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit and windings, resolving power supply problems, and devising
</p>
<p>control laws. Machines should be designed to have the smallest possible dimen-
</p>
<p>sions and mass, and to operate with low energy losses. At the same time, machines
</p>
<p>should be as cheap and robust as possible. At present, the power supply and controls
</p>
<p>of electrical machines are carried out by using static power converters and digital
</p>
<p>signal controllers. Some of the goals of generator control are reduction of losses,
</p>
<p>reduction of electromagnetic and mechanical stress of materials, as well as increas-
</p>
<p>ing the power-to-mass ratio, also called specific power. Motor control aims at
</p>
<p>achieving as high as possible accuracy and speed of reaching the torque and
</p>
<p>speed targets required for performing desired movement of a work machine.
</p>
<p>This book contains the basic knowledge concerning electrical machines neces-
</p>
<p>sary for future electrical engineers. The approach starts from the basic role and
</p>
<p>function of the machine. The characteristics of machine electrical and mechanical
</p>
<p>accesses (ports) are analyzed in order to define the mathematical model, equivalent
</p>
<p>circuits, and mechanical characteristics. This book deals with the elements of
</p>
<p>machine design, problems of heating and cooling, and also with specific imper-
</p>
<p>fections of magnetic circuits and windings. The depth of the study is suited for
</p>
<p>understanding the operating principles of main machine types, for acquiring basic
</p>
<p>knowledge on power supply topologies, and for comprehending essential concepts
</p>
<p>of machine controls. Rotational electromechanical converters are studied in this
</p>
<p>book, whereas the power transformers are omitted.
</p>
<p>14 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.4.1 Basic Characteristics of Electrical Machines
</p>
<p>Design, specification, and analysis of electrical machine applications require an
</p>
<p>adequate idea on the size, mass, construction, reliability, and losses. The basic
</p>
<p>knowledge of electrical machines is required for designing systems incorporating
</p>
<p>electrical machines and solving the problems of power supply and controls. Basic
</p>
<p>electrical machine concepts are also required for designing monitoring and protec-
</p>
<p>tion systems, designing servomotor controllers in robotics, and designing controls
</p>
<p>and protections for synchronous generators in electrical power plants. The knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of electrical machines is required in all situations and tasks likely to be put
</p>
<p>before an electrical engineer in industry, power generation, industrial automation,
</p>
<p>and robotics.
</p>
<p>1.4.2 Equivalent Circuits
</p>
<p>The torque and speed control of an electrical machine is performed by establishing
</p>
<p>the winding voltages and currents by means of an appropriate power supply. Design
</p>
<p>or selection of power supply for a given electrical machine requires establishing
</p>
<p>relations between the machine flux, torque, voltages, and currents. The steady
</p>
<p>state relations are described by a steady state equivalent circuit. The equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit is an electrical circuit containing resistors, inductances, and electromotive
</p>
<p>forces. At steady state, with constant speed and with the given amplitude and
</p>
<p>frequency of the supply, the equivalent circuit allows calculation of currents in
</p>
<p>the windings. Based upon the currents determined from the equivalent circuit, it is
</p>
<p>possible to calculate the steady state flux, torque, power of electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversion, and power losses.
</p>
<p>1.4.3 Mechanical Characteristic
</p>
<p>For the given voltage and frequency of the power supply, the calculation of the
</p>
<p>steady state values of the machine speed and torque requires the torque-speed
</p>
<p>characteristic of the work machine which is attached to the shaft and acts as
</p>
<p>mechanical load. The relation Tm�Om of the work machine is also calledmechani-
cal characteristic of the load, and it is expressed by the function Tm(Om). In a like
</p>
<p>manner, mechanical characteristic of the electrical machine is the relation between
</p>
<p>the electromagnetic torque Tem and the rotor speed Om in the steady state. It is
</p>
<p>possible to express the mechanical characteristic by function Tem(Om) and present it
</p>
<p>graphically in the Tem-Om plane. Determination of the mechanical characteristic can
</p>
<p>be carried out by using mathematical model of the machine. The steady state
</p>
<p>operating point is found at the intersection of the two mechanical characteristics,
</p>
<p>Tem(Om) and Tm(Om).
</p>
<p>1.4 Target Knowledge and Skills 15</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.4.4 Transient Processes in Electrical Machines
</p>
<p>The equivalent circuit and mechanical characteristics can be used for the steady
</p>
<p>state analysis of electrical machines, i.e., in the operating modes where the torque,
</p>
<p>flux, speed of rotation, currents, and voltages do not change their values,
</p>
<p>amplitudes, or frequencies. There are numerous applications where it is required
</p>
<p>to accomplish fast variations of the torque and speed of rotation. In these
</p>
<p>applications, it is necessary to have a mathematical representation of the machine
</p>
<p>which reflects its behavior during transients. This representation is called mathe-
</p>
<p>matical model. Deriving the mathematical model, one cannot start from the
</p>
<p>assumption that machine operates in steady state. For this reason, such model is
</p>
<p>also called dynamic model. Examples of electrical machine applications where the
</p>
<p>dynamic model has to be used are the controls of industrial manipulators and robots
</p>
<p>and propulsion of electrical vehicles. The motion control implies variations of
</p>
<p>speed and position along a predefined trajectory of a tool, work piece, vehicle, or
</p>
<p>an arm of an industrial robot. Whenever the controlled object falls out of the desired
</p>
<p>trajectory, it is necessary to assert a relatively fast change of the force (or torque) in
</p>
<p>order to drive the controlled object back to the desired path and annihilate the error.
</p>
<p>The task of the position (or speed) controller is to calculate the force (torque) to be
</p>
<p>applied in order to remove the detected position (or speed) discrepancy. The task of
</p>
<p>electrical motor is to deliver desired torque as fast and accurate as possible. In such
</p>
<p>servo applications, electrical motors are required to realize very fast changes of
</p>
<p>torque in order to remove the influence of variable motion resistances on the speed
</p>
<p>and position of the controlled objects. The analysis of operation of an electrical
</p>
<p>machine used as a servomotor in motion control applications requires thorough
</p>
<p>knowledge of transient processes within the machine.
</p>
<p>Another case where the mathematical model is required is the analysis of
</p>
<p>transient processes in grid-connected synchronous generators operating in electrical
</p>
<p>power plants. Sudden rises and falls of electrical consumption in transmission
</p>
<p>networks are caused by switching on and off of large consumers, or quite frequently
</p>
<p>by short circuits. They affect generators as an abrupt change of their electrical load.
</p>
<p>The analysis of generator voltages and currents during transients cannot be
</p>
<p>performed by using the steady state equivalent circuit. Instead, it is required to
</p>
<p>have a mathematical model depicting the transient phenomena within the machine.
</p>
<p>1.4.5 Mathematical Model
</p>
<p>The mathematical model is represented by a set of algebraic and differential
</p>
<p>equations describing behavior of a machine during transients and in steady states.
</p>
<p>The voltage balance equations express the equilibrium of voltage in the machine
</p>
<p>windings, and they have the form u &frac14; Ri + dC/dt. The change of the rotor speed is
determined by Newton differential equation J dOm/dt &frac14; Tem � Tm. Quantities such

<p>as J and R are parameters, while Om and C are variables describing the state of the
</p>
<p>machine (state variables). An electrical engineer needs the model of electrical
</p>
<p>machine for performing the analysis of the energy conversion processes, for the
</p>
<p>analysis of conversion losses, for designing of the machine power supply and
</p>
<p>controls, as well as for solving the problems that may occur during machine
</p>
<p>applications. For this reason, it is necessary to have a relatively simple and intuitive
</p>
<p>model so that it can present the processes and states of the machine in a concise and
</p>
<p>clear way. A good model should be thorough and concise outline of the relevant
</p>
<p>phenomena within the machine, suitable for making conclusions and taking
</p>
<p>decisions as regards power supply, controls, and use of the electrical machines.
</p>
<p>There are aspects and phenomena within the machine which are not relevant for
</p>
<p>problems under the scope because they influence operation of an electrical machine
</p>
<p>to a very limited extent. They are called secondary or parasitic effects, as they are
</p>
<p>usually neglected in order to obtain a simpler, more practical mathematical model.
</p>
<p>As an example, the energy density we &frac14; e E2/2 of electric field E within electrical
machines can be neglected. It is lower than the energy density of magnetic field
</p>
<p>by several orders of magnitude. In the process of modeling, other justifiable
</p>
<p>omissions are adopted in order to obtain a simplified model which still matches
</p>
<p>the purpose. For the problem under consideration, the most appropriate model is
</p>
<p>the simplest one, yet depicting all the relevant dynamic phenomena. Justifiable
</p>
<p>omissions of secondary effects lead to mathematical models that are less complex
</p>
<p>and more intuitive. With such models, it is easier to overview the main features of
</p>
<p>the system. The problem solving and decision-making process becomes quicker
</p>
<p>and straightforward.
</p>
<p>In electrical engineering, the model is usually a set of differential equations
</p>
<p>describing behavior of a system. Model of an electrical machine, or a transformer,
</p>
<p>can be reduced to the equivalent circuit describing its steady state operation. On the
</p>
<p>basis of the model, it is possible to determine the mechanical characteristic of
</p>
<p>the machine.
</p>
<p>1.5 Adopted Approach and Analysis Steps
</p>
<p>In general, the material presented in this book is intended for electrical engineering
</p>
<p>students. The basic knowledge of mathematics, physics, and electricity is practi-
</p>
<p>cally applied in studying electrical machines, by many students met for the very
</p>
<p>first time. The approach starts with general notion and then goes to detail. It allows
</p>
<p>the beginners to perceive at first the basic purpose, appearance, and fundamental
</p>
<p>characteristics of electrical machines. Following the introductory chapters, this
</p>
<p>book investigates operating modes in typical applications and studies equivalent
</p>
<p>circuits, mechanical characteristics, power supply topologies and controls, as well
</p>
<p>as the losses and the problems in exploitation. Later on, the focus is turned to details
</p>
<p>related to the three main types of electrical machines.
</p>
<p>1.5 Adopted Approach and Analysis Steps 17</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The attention is directed toward DC, asynchronous, and synchronous machines.
</p>
<p>In this book, other types of electrical machines have not been studied in detail.
</p>
<p>The problems associated with design of electrical machines are briefly mentioned.
</p>
<p>The winding techniques, magnetic circuit design, analysis of secondary phenom-
</p>
<p>ena, the secondary and parasitic losses, and construction details have been left out
</p>
<p>for further studies. The main purpose of this book is introducing the reader to
</p>
<p>the role of electrical machines and studying their electrical and mechanical
</p>
<p>properties in order to acquire the ability to specify their electrical and mechanical
</p>
<p>characteristics, to define their power supplies and control laws, and to design
</p>
<p>systems with electrical motors and generators.
</p>
<p>The study of electrical machines starts by an introduction to the basic principles
</p>
<p>of operation and with a survey of functions of electrical generators and motors in
</p>
<p>their most frequent applications. The analysis steps include the principles of
</p>
<p>electromechanical conversion and study the conversion process by taking the
</p>
<p>example of an electrostatic machine. Energy of the coupling electrical field is
</p>
<p>analyzed along with the process of energy exchange between the field, the electrical
</p>
<p>source, and the mechanical port. The study proceeds with the analysis of a simple
</p>
<p>electromechanical converter with magnetic coupling field. Construction of the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit and windings of the machine are followed by specification of
</p>
<p>conversion losses. Subsequently, rotational electromechanical converters with
</p>
<p>magnetic coupling are considered, along with the rotating electrical machines
</p>
<p>which are the main subject of this study. The basic notions and definitions include
</p>
<p>the magnetic resistances and circuits, concentrated and distributed windings,
</p>
<p>methods of calculating the flux per turn and the winding flux, and the expressions
</p>
<p>for the winding self-inductances, mutual inductances, and leakage inductances.
</p>
<p>Magnetomotive forces of the winding are explained and analyzed, as well as
</p>
<p>electromotive forces induced in concentrated and distributed windings. The mag-
</p>
<p>netic field in the air gap is analyzed and applied in modeling the electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversion in cylindrical machines. The electromagnetic torque and the power of
</p>
<p>electromechanical conversion are expressed in terms of flux vectors and magne-
</p>
<p>tomotive forces. The concept and creation of rotating magnetic field are detailed
</p>
<p>and used to describe the difference between direct current (DC) machines and
</p>
<p>alternating current (AC) machines. The mathematical model of a cylindrical
</p>
<p>machine with the windings having N coils is derived, along with the expressions
</p>
<p>for electrical power, mechanical power, and power losses in the windings, magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit, and the mechanical subsystem. The secondary phenomena that are usually
</p>
<p>neglected in the analysis of electrical machines are specified and explained. At the
</p>
<p>same time, some sample applications and operating conditions are named where
</p>
<p>the secondary phenomena cannot be excluded from the analysis.
</p>
<p>The introduction is followed by the chapters dealing with DC machines, asyn-
</p>
<p>chronousmachines (AM), and synchronousmachines (SM). Each chapter starts with
</p>
<p>basic description and the operating principles of the relevant machine, followed by
</p>
<p>the most significant aspects of its construction, description of its merits, the most
</p>
<p>frequent applications, and meaningful shortcomings. The expressions are derived
</p>
<p>18 1 Introduction</p>

<p>for the magnetomotive force, flux, electromotive force, torque, and conversion
</p>
<p>power. Mathematical model is derived for the machine under consideration, describ-
</p>
<p>ing its behavior during transient processes and providing the grounds for obtaining
</p>
<p>the equivalent circuits and mechanical characteristics. In the case of AC electrical
</p>
<p>machines, the modeling includes introduction of the three-phase/two-phase coordi-
</p>
<p>nate transformation (Clarke transform) and coordinate transformation from the
</p>
<p>stationary coordinate frame to the revolving coordinate frame (dq or Park
</p>
<p>transform).
</p>
<p>The equivalent electrical circuits of the machine are derived from the steady
</p>
<p>state analysis. They are used to calculate the currents, voltages, flux, torque, and
</p>
<p>power at steady states, where the supply voltage, the load torque Tm, and the speed
</p>
<p>of rotation are known and unchanging. The mathematical model is also used to
</p>
<p>obtain the mechanical characteristic which gives the steady state relation of the
</p>
<p>machine speed and torque delivered to the shaft. For each electrical machine,
</p>
<p>the operating regimes sustainable in the steady state are analyzed and formulated
</p>
<p>as the steady state operating area in the Tem-Om plane. Likewise, the transient
</p>
<p>operating area of the Tem-Om plane is defined, representing the transient operating
</p>
<p>regimes attainable in short time intervals.
</p>
<p>Particular attention is paid to conversion losses. The losses in the windings and
</p>
<p>magnetic circuits are analyzed in depth, along with heating of electrical machines
</p>
<p>and the methods of their cooling. The highest sustainable values of the current,
</p>
<p>power, and torque are defined and explored. These values and the highest sustain-
</p>
<p>able values of other relevant quantities are called the rated values.6 The need for
</p>
<p>operation in the region of field weakening is emphasized, and the relevant relations
</p>
<p>and characteristics are derived.
</p>
<p>The transient operating area is analyzed for DC and AC machines. It is derived
</p>
<p>from the short-term overload capabilities of mechanical and electrical ports of
</p>
<p>electrical machines. The analysis takes into account the impact of peak current
</p>
<p>and peak voltage capabilities of the electrical power supply on the machine
</p>
<p>transient performance. Basic information concerning the supply, controls, and
</p>
<p>typical power converter topologies used in conjunction with the electrical machine
</p>
<p>is given for DC, asynchronous, and synchronous machines.
</p>
<p>6The rated values are the highest permissible values of the machine currents, voltages, power,
</p>
<p>speed, and torque in a continuous service. Permanent operation with higher values will damage the
</p>
<p>machine&rsquo;s vital parts due to phenomena such as overheating. They are usually the result of
</p>
<p>engineering calculation, and they also represent an important property of the machine. The rated
</p>
<p>values are usually related to specified ambient temperature. Typically, the rated power is the
</p>
<p>maximum power the electrical machine can deliver continuously at 40�C ambient temperature.
The values written on the machine plate or in manufacturer&rsquo;s specifications are called nameplate or
</p>
<p>nominal values. The nominal and rated values are usually equal. In rare cases, manufacturer may
</p>
<p>have the reason to declare the nominal values lower than the rated values. Within this book, it is
</p>
<p>assumed that the nominal values correspond to the rated. They are denoted by a lowercase
</p>
<p>subscript n, such as in Un or In.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.5.1 Prerequisites
</p>
<p>Precondition to understanding analysis and considerations in this book, accepting
</p>
<p>the knowledge, acquiring the target skills, and solving the problems is the knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of mathematics, physics, and basic electrical engineering which is normally
</p>
<p>taught at the first year of undergraduate studies of engineering. It is required to know
</p>
<p>the basic laws of motion and practical relations concerning rotation and translation.
</p>
<p>Required background includes the steady state electrical and magnetic fields, the
</p>
<p>basic characteristics of dielectric and ferromagnetic materials, and elementary
</p>
<p>boundary conditions for electrostatic and magnetic fields. Chapter 2, Electromag-
</p>
<p>netic Energy Conversion, deals with the analysis of the energy and forces associated
</p>
<p>with electrostatic and magnetic fields in dielectrics, ferromagnetics, and air. Further
</p>
<p>on, analysis includes solving simple electric circuits with DC or AC currents.
</p>
<p>In addition, the analysis extends on the magnetic circuits involving magnetomotive
</p>
<p>forces (magnetic voltages), flux linkage, andmagnetic resistances. The basic laws of
</p>
<p>electrical engineering should be known, like Faraday law on electromagnetic induc-
</p>
<p>tion, Ampere law, Lorentz law, and Kirchhoff laws and similar. The study includes
</p>
<p>spatial distribution of the current, field, and energy. Therefore, coordinates in
</p>
<p>the Cartesian or in the cylindrical coordinate systems will be used along with the
</p>
<p>corresponding unit vectors. A consistent effort is sustained throughout this book to
</p>
<p>make the developments material accessible to readers not familiar with spatial
</p>
<p>derivatives, such as rotor (curl, rot) or divergence (div). Therefore, familiarity
with Maxwell differential equations is not inevitable. Instead of differential form
</p>
<p>of Maxwell laws, it is sufficient to know their integral form, such as Ampere law.
</p>
<p>The skill in handling complex numbers and phasors is required, as well as dealing
</p>
<p>with scalar and vector products of vectors. For determining direction of a vector
</p>
<p>product, one should be familiar with the right-hand rule. Also required are the
</p>
<p>abilities of representing and perceiving relations between three-dimensional objects,
</p>
<p>of identifying closed surfaces defining a domain, and of contours defining a surface
</p>
<p>and surface normals. Within this book, the problem solving involves relatively
</p>
<p>simple line and surface integrals and solution of first-order linear differential
</p>
<p>equations. An experience in reducing differential equations to algebraic equations
</p>
<p>by applying Laplace transform and the ability of performing basic operations with
</p>
<p>matrices and vectors are also useful.
</p>
<p>1.6 Notes on Converter Fed Variable Speed Machines
</p>
<p>This book has not been written with an intention to prepare a reader for designing
</p>
<p>electrical machines. The main goal is studying the electrical and mechanical
</p>
<p>characteristics of electrical machines from the user&rsquo;s point of view, with an intention
</p>
<p>to prepare a reader for selecting an adequate machine, for solving the problems
</p>
<p>associated with the power supply and controls, and for handling the problems that
</p>
<p>may appear during operation of electrical motors and generators. The specific

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>knowledge required for designing electrical machines is left out for further studies.
</p>
<p>The prerequisite for exploring further is a thorough acceptance of the knowledge and
</p>
<p>skills comprised within this book. The need for skilled designers of electrical
</p>
<p>machines is higher than before. Some of the reasons for this are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; During the last century, electrical machines were designed to operate from the
</p>
<p>grid, with constant voltages and with the line frequency. Development of static
</p>
<p>power converters, providing three-phase voltages of variable frequency and
</p>
<p>amplitude, permits the power supply of an electrical motor to be adjusted to
</p>
<p>the speed and torque. Most new designs with electrical motors include static
</p>
<p>power converters that convert the energy received from the grid into the form
</p>
<p>best suited to the actual speed and torque. The voltage and frequency can be
</p>
<p>adjusted to reduce the power losses while delivering the reference torque at
</p>
<p>given speed. Therefore, there is an emerging quest for electrical machines
</p>
<p>designed to operate in conjunction with static power converters and variable
</p>
<p>frequency power supply.
</p>
<p>&bull; Applications of electrical motors for propelling electrical vehicles or driving
</p>
<p>industrial robots often require the rotor speed exceeding several hundreds of
</p>
<p>revolutions per second, which requires the power supply frequencies of the order
</p>
<p>of f &gt; 500 Hz. Therefore, within contemporary servomotors and traction
motors, electrical currents and magnetic induction pulsate at the same frequency.
</p>
<p>Fast variation of magnetic field requires application of new magnetic materials
</p>
<p>and novel design solutions for magnetic circuits. The increased frequencies of
</p>
<p>electric currents demand new solutions for making the windings.
</p>
<p>&bull; Propelling industrial robots requires electrical motors having a fast response and
</p>
<p>low inertia. Therefore, it is required to design synchronous motors having
</p>
<p>permanent magnets in their rotors, with the rotor shape and size resulting in a
</p>
<p>low inertia and fast acceleration, such as a disc or a hollow cylinder with double
</p>
<p>air gap.
</p>
<p>&bull; An increased interest in alternative and renewable power sources requires design
</p>
<p>of novel synchronous generators, suitable for the operation in conjunction with
</p>
<p>wind turbines, tidal turbines, and similar. The speed and the operating frequency
</p>
<p>are variable, while in some cases, generators operate at a very low speed. At the
</p>
<p>same time, the inertia and weight of generators should be low, with the lowest
</p>
<p>possible power losses.
</p>
<p>&bull; Construction of thermal electric power plants with supercritical steam pressure
</p>
<p>enables design of a single block in excess of 1 GW. Mechanical power of the
</p>
<p>block, obtained from a steam turbine, is converted to electrical energy by means
</p>
<p>of a synchronous generator operating at the line frequency of 50 Hz. Designing
</p>
<p>generators of this high power demands application of new design solutions, new
</p>
<p>insulating and ferromagnetic materials, and new cooling methods and systems.
</p>
<p>The need to increase the production of electrical energy and the need to reduce
</p>
<p>the heat released to the environment can be alleviated by reducing the losses and
</p>
<p>increasing the energy efficiency � of electrical machines. The efficiency of
generators and motors can be increased by adequate control, but also by designing
</p>
<p>novel electrical machines and applying new materials in their construction.
</p>
<p>1.6 Notes on Converter Fed Variable Speed Machines 21</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.7 Remarks on High Efficiency Machines
</p>
<p>Reduction in power losses increases the energy efficiency of electrical machines
</p>
<p>and relieves the problem of their cooling. As all the machine losses eventually turn
</p>
<p>into heat, the loss reduction diminishes the heat emitted to the environment. The
</p>
<p>heat released by electrical machines is a form of environmental pollution, and it
</p>
<p>should be kept low. Considering the fact that industrial countries use more than 2/3
</p>
<p>of their electrical energy in electrical motors, the loss reduction in electrical
</p>
<p>machines has the greatest potential of energy saving. In addition, an efficient heat
</p>
<p>removal (cooling) often requires specific engineering solutions, increasing in this
</p>
<p>way the cost and complexity of the design. For these reasons, there is an increasing
</p>
<p>need for designing new, more efficient electrical machines and to devise their
</p>
<p>controls that would reduce the losses. Designing new solutions for electrical
</p>
<p>generators and motors requires a thorough basic knowledge on their operating
</p>
<p>principles, and it is bound to use novel ferromagnetic materials and new design
</p>
<p>concepts. One example is the use of permanent magnet excitation which eliminates
</p>
<p>the excitation winding and cuts down the rotor losses of synchronous machines.
</p>
<p>Besides, an efficient electromechanical conversion requires as well new solutions
</p>
<p>for the machine supply. Most of contemporary machines do not have a direct
</p>
<p>connection to the grid and do not operate with line-frequency voltages and currents.
</p>
<p>Instead, they are fed from static power converters which transform the grid supply
</p>
<p>to the form which is consistent with an efficient operation of the machine. Supply
</p>
<p>from a static power converter allows for the flux changes and selection of the flux
</p>
<p>level which results in the lowest power losses. Successful design of electrical
</p>
<p>machines supplied from static power converters requires a thorough knowledge
</p>
<p>on electrical and magnetic fields within the machine, as well as the knowledge on
</p>
<p>the energy conversion processes taking place within switching power converters.
</p>
<p>1.8 Remarks on Iron and Copper Usage
</p>
<p>On a wider scale, the energy efficiency of electrical machines includes as well the
</p>
<p>amount of energy consumed in the course of themachine production.Manufacturing
</p>
<p>of electrolytic copper and aluminum and making of laminated steel sheets require
</p>
<p>large amounts of energy. For this reason, the machine that uses fewer raw materials
</p>
<p>is likely to be the more efficient one. Construction of electrical machines has certain
</p>
<p>similarities with the construction of power transformers. In both cases, the appliance
</p>
<p>has a magnetic circuit and some electrical current circuits. Traditionally, magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits are made of laminated steel sheets, whereas electric circuits (windings) are
</p>
<p>made of insulated copper conductors. Both transformers and electrical machines are
</p>
<p>used within systems comprising energy converters, semiconductor switches,
</p>
<p>sensors, microprocessor control systems, and the associated software. The decisive
</p>
<p>factor which governs the price of the whole system is the iron and copper weight
</p>
<p>22 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>involved. Namely, production of semiconductor devices requires relatively small
</p>
<p>quantities of raw materials, such as the silicon ingot, some donor and acceptor
</p>
<p>impurities, and relatively small quantities of ceramic or plastic materials for the
</p>
<p>casing. Moreover, development, design, and software production costs have an
</p>
<p>insignificant contribution to the cost in series production. Therefore, it is significant
</p>
<p>to design and manufacture units and systems with reduced consumption of iron and
</p>
<p>copper. Reducing the quantities of rawmaterials can be accomplished in three ways:
</p>
<p>In the system design phase, the operating conditions of electrical machines
involved in the system can be planned so as to manufacture them with a reduced
</p>
<p>consumption of iron and copper.
</p>
<p>In the electrical machine design phase, it is possible to make the magnetic and
electric circuits in a manner that saves on raw materials. As an example, four-pole7
</p>
<p>machines make a better use of the magnetic circuit than two-pole machines.
</p>
<p>During the operation of electrical machine supplied from a static power
converter, it is possible to use the control methods that maximize the torque and
</p>
<p>power available from the given magnetic and electric circuits. In this way, there is
</p>
<p>an increase in the specific torque and specific power.8 Given the torque and power
</p>
<p>requirements, it is possible to design and make the electrical machine with less iron
</p>
<p>and less copper.
</p>
<p>Contemporary computer tools for design of electrical machines allow antici-
pation of their characteristics prior to making and testing a prototype. This
</p>
<p>facilitates and speeds up the design process. Moreover, it becomes possible to test
</p>
<p>several different solutions and approaches over a relatively short period of time.
</p>
<p>Most of the software packages make use of the finite element analysis (FEM) of
</p>
<p>electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and thermal processes. Designing with computer
</p>
<p>tools brings up the risk of inadvertent errors. The problems arise in cases when
</p>
<p>designer pretends that the tool performs the creative part of the job. A computer tool
</p>
<p>will give an output for each set of input data, whether the input makes sense or not.
</p>
<p>Therefore, a user has to possess certain experience in design, in order to interpret
</p>
<p>properly the obtained results and notice errors and contradictions. A conservative
</p>
<p>use of computer tools consists of using computer for quick completion of automatic
</p>
<p>tasks and calculations which the designer would have performed himself if he had
</p>
<p>sufficient time.
</p>
<p>7The operation of electrical machines involving multiple pairs of magnetic poles will be explained
</p>
<p>in chapter on asynchronous machines.
8 For the given electrical machine, specific torque is the ratio between the available torque and the
</p>
<p>mass (or volume) of the machine. Hence, it is the torque per unit mass (or volume). The same holds
</p>
<p>for the specific power. With higher specific torque (or power), electrical machine is smaller and/or
</p>
<p>lighter for the same task.

<p>Chapter 2
</p>
<p>Electromechanical Energy Conversion
</p>
<p>Electrical machines contain stationary and moving parts coupled by an electrical or
</p>
<p>magnetic field. The field acts on the machine parts and plays key role in the process
</p>
<p>of electromechanical conversion. For this reason, it is often referred to as the
</p>
<p>coupling field. This chapter presents the most significant principles of creating a
</p>
<p>force or torque on the machine moving parts. In all the cases considered, the force
</p>
<p>appears due to the action of the electrostatic or magnetic field on the moving parts
</p>
<p>of the machine. Depending on the nature of the coupling field, the machines can be
</p>
<p>magnetic or electrostatic.
</p>
<p>2.1 Lorentz Force
</p>
<p>Electrical machines perform conversion of electrical energy to mechanical work or
</p>
<p>conversion of mechanical work to electrical energy. The basic principles involved
</p>
<p>in the process of electromechanical conversion are presented in the considerations
</p>
<p>which follow.
</p>
<p>One of the laws of physics which is basic for electromechanical conversion is
</p>
<p>Lorentz law which determines the force acting upon a charge Q moving with a
</p>
<p>speed v in the electrical and magnetic fields:
</p>
<p>~F &frac14; Q~E&thorn; Q ~v� ~B

</p>
<p>: (2.1)
</p>
<p>In electrical machines, the operation is most often based on the magnetic
</p>
<p>coupling field. Conductors and ferromagnetic parts in a magnetic field are subjected
</p>
<p>to the action of electromagnetic forces. Magnetic induction B in (2.1) is also called
</p>
<p>flux density. Electrical current existing in the conductor is a directed motion of
</p>
<p>electrical charges. Therefore, (2.1) can be used to determine the force acting upon
</p>
<p>conductors carrying electrical currents.

<p>Figure 2.1 shows straight portion of a conductor of length l with electrical
</p>
<p>current i which is placed in a homogenous magnetic field with flux density B.
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic force F acting on the conductor depends on current i, conductor
</p>
<p>length l, flux density B, and angle between directions of the field and the conductor.
</p>
<p>In the example presented in Fig. 2.1, the conductor is perpendicular to the direction
</p>
<p>of the field. Applying the Cartesian coordinate system with axes x, y, and z, the
</p>
<p>vectors of magnetic induction B, conductor length, and force can be expressed in
</p>
<p>terms of the corresponding unit vectors.

</p>
<p>Since the vector B is orthogonal to the conductor, the module of the force vector
</p>
<p>is equal to F &frac14; l�B�i. Direction of the force is determined by the vector product.
The right-hand rule1 can be used to determine quickly the vector product direction.

<p>If the considered part of the conductor makes a displacement Dy along the axis
</p>
<p>y, corresponding mechanical work is DW &frac14; FDy. At a constant speed of motion
vy, the mechanical power assumes the value pm &frac14; Fvy. In the case when the force
acts in the direction of motion, power pm is positive, and the system operates as a
</p>
<p>motor, delivering mechanical work and power. Otherwise, the motion and force are
</p>
<p>opposed, power pm is negative, and the mechanical work is converted to electrical
</p>
<p>energy, while the system operates as a generator.
</p>
<p>1The right-hand rule requires thumb and forefinger to assume right angle. The middle finger
</p>
<p>should be perpendicular to both. Now, with forefinger alligned with vector l and middle finger
</p>
<p>alligned with B, thumb determines the direction of force. Alternatively, direction of any vector
</p>
<p>product can be determined by an imaginary experiment, where the first vector of the product (l in
</p>
<p>(2.2)) is rotated toward the second vector (B). Envisaging a screw that is turned by such rotation,
</p>
<p>the screw would advance along the axis perpendicular to l � B plane. The direction of the vector
product is determined by the advance of the (right) screw.

<p>In a conductor moving through a homogeneous magnetic field, induced
</p>
<p>electromotive force e depends on flux density B, speed of motion, and conductor
</p>
<p>length l. The product of the electromotive force e and current i is equal to the
</p>
<p>product of the force and speed (pm &frac14; Fvy), as shown later on. Assuming that energy
losses are negligible, the motor operation can be perceived as a lossless conversion
</p>
<p>of electrical power pe to mechanical power pm. The relevant powers are represented
</p>
<p>by derivatives of the electrical energy and mechanical work.
</p>
<p>2.2 Mutual Action of Parallel Conductors
</p>
<p>In the previous example, the case is considered of a conductor in a homogenous
</p>
<p>external magnetic field which exists due to the action of external current circuits or
</p>
<p>permanent magnets. Force acting on conductors also exists in the case when there is
</p>
<p>no externally brought field, but there are two conductors both conducting electrical
</p>
<p>currents.
</p>
<p>Magnetic field created by one of the conductors interacts with the current in the
</p>
<p>other conductor, according to the principle presented in Fig. 2.2. The result of this
</p>
<p>interaction is force acting on the conductor.
</p>
<p>When currents in the conductors have the same direction, the force tends to bring
</p>
<p>the conductors closer. In the case when directions of the currents are mutually
</p>
<p>opposite, the force tends to separate the conductors.
</p>
<p>In the case being considered, the force acting on parallel conductors is very
</p>
<p>small. If two very long and thin parallel conductors, each with current of 1A, placed
</p>
<p>at a distance d &frac14; 0.1 m are considered, one of the conductors will be found in the
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.2 (a) Magnetic field and magnetic induction of a straight conductor. (b) Force of attraction
between two parallel conductors. (c) Force of repulsion between two parallel conductors

<p>magnetic field created by the other conductor. The magnetic induction created by a

</p>
<p>2p � 0:1

</p>
<p>Since the magnetic field and magnetic induction are orthogonal to the conductor,
</p>
<p>the electromagnetic force acting on a part of the conductor 1m long is given by (2.4):
</p>
<p>F &frac14; l � B � I &frac14; 2 � 10�6N: (2.4)
</p>
<p>Magnetic circuits are discussed later in the book. They are made of ferromag-
</p>
<p>netic materials with high permeability m, and they direct the magnetic flux2 to paths
</p>
<p>with low magnetic resistance. The lines of magnetic field are concentrated into
</p>
<p>magnetic circuits in a way that resembles electrical current being contained in
</p>
<p>conductors and windings. In turn, there is a considerable increase of the flux density
</p>
<p>B, resulting in an increase in electromagnetic force and power of conversion, both
</p>
<p>proportional to B.
</p>
<p>2.3 Electromotive Force in a Moving Conductor
</p>
<p>A considerable number of electrical machines convert mechanical work to electrical
</p>
<p>energy, like synchronous generators in electrical power plants. Figure 2.3 shows the
</p>
<p>principle where mechanical work andmechanical power are used to obtain electrical
</p>
<p>energy and electrical power. The figure shows straight part of conductor of length l,
</p>
<p>moving along y-axis at a speed v. The conductor placed in a homogeneous magnetic
</p>
<p>field is moved by action of an external force Fs. Direction of vector B is opposite to
</p>
<p>direction of axis z.
</p>
<p>Motion of a conductor in magnetic field causes induction of electrical field Eind.
</p>
<p>Induced field strength can be measured by an observer moving together with the
</p>
<p>conductor and cannot be sensed by an immobile observer. The field strength can
</p>
<p>be calculated on the basis of (2.1), expressing the force acting upon a moving
</p>
<p>2 Flux is a scalar quantity having no direction. Flux through surface S is equal to the surface
</p>
<p>integral of the vector of magnetic induction B, also called flux density. Surface S is encircled by
</p>
<p>contour C; thus, the said surface integral is called flux through the contour. Flux through a flat
</p>
<p>surface S placed in a homogeneous external magnetic field depends on its position relative to the
</p>
<p>field. With the positive normal on S aligned with the direction of the vector B, the flux through S is
</p>
<p>equal toF &frac14; BS. Although the flux F is a scalar, it is inherently related to spatial orientation of the
surface S and/or the vector B. The flux vector is obtained by associating the spatial orientation (i.e.,
</p>
<p>direction) to the scalar F. In the given example, the spatial orientation is defined by the positive
</p>
<p>normal on S. Direction of the positive normal is determined by applying the right-hand rule to the
</p>
<p>reference circling direction for the contour C. The external magnetic field is the one which is not
</p>
<p>created by the electrical currents in the contour C.

<p>The force F acts on the moving charge Q due to its motion in homogeneous
</p>
<p>magnetic field. Notice in (2.5) that the same effect can be obtained by replacing
</p>
<p>the magnetic field with the electrostatic field of the strength Eind. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>induced electrical field can be determined by dividing force F by charge Q, which
</p>
<p>gives vector product of the speed and flux density B:
</p>

</p>
<p>It is of interest to determine the electromotive force e induced in the straight part
</p>
<p>of the conductor of length l. In general, the electromotive force induced in
</p>
<p>a conductor is determined by calculating the line integral of vector Eind between
</p>
<p>conductor terminals. Since the induced electrical field does not vary along
</p>
<p>the conductor, the line integral reduces to the scalar product of vectors l and Eind.

<p>In the present case, the conductor is aligned with x-axis, the magnetic field is in

</p>
<p>of the induced electrical field is collinear with the conductor (2.8); thus, the induced
</p>
<p>electromotive force is e &frac14; lvB. The sign of the induced electromotive force
e depends on the adopted reference direction of the conductor. In the present

<p>2.4 Generator Mode
</p>
<p>Terminals of the conductor shown in Fig. 2.3 could be connected to the terminals of
</p>
<p>an immovable resistor, forming in this way a closed current circuit containing the
</p>
<p>induced electromotive force e, interconnections, and resistor R. This circuit is
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 2.4. By neglecting the resistance and inductance of interconnections,
</p>
<p>the current established in the circuit is i &frac14; e/R. The moving conductor performs the
function of a generator, whereas resistor R is a consumer of electrical energy. Since
</p>
<p>direction of the current in the conductor corresponds to the direction of
</p>
<p>electromotive force, the conductor is a source of electrical power and energy.
</p>
<p>Existence of the current in the conductor creates force Fm which opposes the
</p>
<p>movement (2.2). The external force Fs acts in the direction opposite to Fm,
</p>
<p>overcoming the resistance Fm. It is of interest to analyze the operation of the system
</p>
<p>in Fig. 2.4 with the aim of establishing the relation between the invested mechanical
</p>
<p>power Fsv and obtained electrical power ei.
</p>
<p>The electromotive force e &frac14; lvB, induced in the conductor, is equal to the
voltage u &frac14; Ri, which appears across resistance R. The electromagnetic force
acting on the conductor, shown in Fig. 2.4, acts from right to left and is given

<p>By maintaining the movement, the external force Fs performs the work against
</p>
<p>magnetic force Fm and delivers it to the moving conductor. Transfer of the
</p>
<p>mechanical work to electrical work is performed through electromagnetic induc-
</p>
<p>tion. Electromotive force e, induced in the moving conductor, maintains the current
</p>
<p>i &frac14; e/R in the circuit and delivers electrical energy to the resistor.

induced electromotive force e develops power Pe &frac14; ei &frac14; i lvB &frac14; Pm and delivers
it to the rest of the electrical circuit. With Pe &frac14; e2/R &gt; 0, the considered system
converts mechanical work to electrical energy. In the course of this analysis, energy
</p>
<p>losses have been neglected; thus, there is equality between the input (mechanical)
</p>
<p>power and output (electrical) power (Pe &frac14; Pm).
Question (2.1): In the case when the resistor shown in Fig. 2.4 moves together with
the conductor, what will be the electrical current in the circuit?
</p>
<p>Answer (2.1): During a parallel movement of the conductor and resistor, equal
electromotive forces will be induced within each of them, thus compensating each
</p>
<p>other. Therefore, the electrical current will be equal to zero.
</p>
<p>2.5 Reluctant Torque
</p>
<p>Electromechanical energy conversion can be accomplished by exploiting the ten-
</p>
<p>dency of ferromagnetic material placed in a magnetic field to get aligned with the
</p>
<p>field and take position of minimum magnetic resistance. Figure 2.5 shows an
</p>
<p>elongated piece of ferromagnetic material of high permeability (mFe &gt;&gt; m0),
inclined with respect to the lines of magnetic field. The electromagnetic forces
</p>
<p>tend to bring the piece in vertical position where it will be collinear with the field.
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.5 Due to reluctant
torque, a piece of
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic material tends
</p>
<p>to align with the field, thus
</p>
<p>offering a minimum magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance
</p>
<p>2.5 Reluctant Torque 31</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In Fig. 2.5, it is assumed that the magnetic field exists owing to a permanent
</p>
<p>magnet. The moving part (rotor) of ferromagnetic material can rotate and will tend
</p>
<p>to take vertical position where magnetic resistance along the field lines (magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance along the flux path) is lower. When the rotor assumes vertical position,
</p>
<p>the flux passes from the magnet poles into the rotor whose permeability is high.
</p>
<p>The ferromagnetic rotor always tends to align with the field. The torque which
</p>
<p>appears in the considered (inclined) position tends to bring the ferromagnetic to
</p>
<p>vertical position. This torque is called reluctant, and the considered principle of the
</p>
<p>torque generation is called reluctant principle. This name stems from reluctance,
</p>
<p>also called magnetic resistance. Reluctant torque depends on changes in magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance due to spatial displacement of the moving part. The reluctant torque
</p>
<p>tends to bring rotor to position where magnetic resistance is minimal. The rotor can
</p>
<p>be connected to a work machine to deliver mechanical power.
</p>
<p>Question (2.2): What is the value of reluctant torque acting on the rotor when it is
in horizontal position?
</p>
<p>Answer (2.2): The reluctant torque tends to bring the rotor to the position of
minimal magnetic resistance. In horizontal position, magnetic resistance assumes
</p>
<p>its maximum value. A hypothetical shift of the rotor in any direction will lead to a
</p>
<p>decrease of magnetic resistance. Unless moved from horizontal position, there is no
</p>
<p>tendency to move the rotor in any direction, and the reluctant torque is equal to zero.
</p>
<p>In the considered case, there is an unstable equilibrium. Any movement of the rotor
</p>
<p>to either side would result in the reluctant torque which speeds up the initial
</p>
<p>movement.
</p>
<p>2.6 Reluctant Force
</p>
<p>Figure 2.6 shows a system where the reluctant force stimulates a translatory
</p>
<p>movement. Electromagnetic force acts on the piece of ferromagnetic material
</p>
<p>placed in a nonhomogeneous magnetic field. The force tends to bring the piece of
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic to the place where the flux density B is high.
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.6 The electromagnetic
forces tend to bring the piece
</p>
<p>of ferromagnetic material
</p>
<p>inside the coil
</p>
<p>32 2 Electromechanical Energy Conversion</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The coil shown in Fig. 2.6 is made of circular wound conductors carrying a DC
</p>
<p>current. This system of conductors (coil, winding, or bobbin) creates a magnetic
</p>
<p>field that extends along the coil and has maximum intensity inside the coil. Hence,
</p>
<p>the flux path goes through the cylindrical coil. A piece of mobile ferromagnetic
</p>
<p>material can be inserted in the coil or extracted from the coil.
</p>
<p>If the ferromagnetic piece is in the coil, the magnetic resistance (reluctance)
</p>
<p>along the flux path is low. When the ferromagnetic piece is outside the coil, the
</p>
<p>reluctance is high.
</p>
<p>Taking into account that the mobile part of ferromagnetic material tends to take
</p>
<p>position where the magnetic resistance is minimal, the force will appear tempting to
</p>
<p>bring the mobile piece of ferromagnetic material in the coil.
</p>
<p>2.7 Forces on Conductors in Electrical Field
</p>
<p>Thanks to the action of electrical field E, one can obtain force, power, and work
</p>
<p>from the setup shown in Fig. 2.7. In the space between two parallel, charged
</p>
<p>capacitor plates, there is an electrostatic field E. In the case when the distance
</p>
<p>between the plates is small compared to their dimensions, the field can be consid-
</p>
<p>ered homogeneous. Namely, the field lines are parallel, while the field strength does
</p>
<p>not change between the plates.
</p>
<p>The charges are distributed on the interior surfaces of the plates. The field
</p>
<p>between the plates acts on the surface charges by a force tending to bring the plates
</p>
<p>closer. Force F may cause the plates to move. If one of the plates shifts by Dx, a
</p>
<p>mechanical work FDx is achieved.
</p>
<p>Based on this principle, it is possible to operate electromechanical converters
</p>
<p>with electrical coupling field, also called electrostatic machines.
</p>
<p>2.8 Change of Permittivity
</p>
<p>Electromechanical conversion can be based on electrical force acting on a mobile
</p>
<p>part of dielectric material with permittivity (dielectric constant e) different from the
</p>
<p>permittivity of the environment. Figure 2.8 shows two charged plates and a mobile

</p>
<p>The piece of dielectric material of relative permittivity er &gt; 1 can move along a
horizontal direction. By moving to the left, it comes to position x &frac14; a, when it fills
completely the space between the plates. By moving to the right, the dielectric comes
</p>
<p>to position x &frac14; 0, when the space between the plates is completely filled by air. The
following analysis will show that an electrical force F acts on the piece of dielectric in
</p>
<p>position 0 &lt; x &lt; a, tempting to bring it into the space between the plates.
With voltage U across the plates, electrical field E in the space between the
</p>
<p>plates is E &frac14; U/d, where d is distance between the plates. The conductive plates
represent equipotential surfaces; thus, relation U &frac14; Ed applies in the air as well as
in the dielectric, while the strength of the electrical field is the same in both media.
</p>
<p>Electrical induction within the dielectric is D&frac14;ere0U/d, whereas in the air, it is
D&frac14;e0U/d. Total energy of the electrical field is given by (2.11), where S &frac14; ab

<p>It is possible to determine electrical force F by using the equivalent pressure on

<p>the surfaces separating the media of different nature. On the basis of a conclusion

<p>from electrostatics, electrical force acting on a dividing surface that separates the
</p>

</p>
<p>the equivalent pressure p &frac14; we1 � we2. The values we1 and we2 are specific

<p>Question (2.3): Determine the direction of force when the source is disconnected.
It should be noted that total chargeQ existing on the plates is then constant, whereas
</p>
<p>the voltage between the plates is variable depending on position of the dielectric.
</p>
<p>Answer (2.3): In the space between the plates, there is a homogeneous electrical
field. Conductivity 1/r of the metal plates is very high, and potential of all the points
</p>
<p>on one plate is the same. Therefore, voltage between the plates is U in the part filled
</p>
<p>by the dielectric as well as in the part filled by air. Since the field is homogeneous
</p>
<p>and orthogonal to the plates, product Ed is equal to voltage U; thus, electrical field
</p>
<p>E &frac14; U/d is the same in both air and the dielectric. Since permittivity of the

</p>
<p>Question (2.4): Consider a charged capacitor made of the plates shown in Fig. 2.8
and assume that the plates are not connected to the source. Is there any difference
</p>
<p>between E and D in the part filled by air and part filled by dielectric? Will the total
</p>
<p>energy be increased or decreased in the case that the dielectric is pushed further into
</p>
<p>the space between the plates?
</p>
<p>Answer (2.4): In the space between the plates, the electrical field E is equal in all
points, whereas the electrical induction D is er times higher in the space filled by
</p>
<p>dielectric compared to induction in the space filled by air. The spatial density of
</p>
<p>the field energy in the dielectric is wed &frac14; &frac12;ere0E2, and it is er times higher than the
density wea &frac14; &frac12;e0E2 in the air. Total field energy is weaVa + wedVd, where wea and
wed are the densities of field energy in the air and in the dielectric, whereas Va
and Vd are the volumes of the interelectrode space filled by air and dielectric.
</p>
<p>36 2 Electromechanical Energy Conversion</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When the piece of dielectric moves toward inside of the capacitor, volume Va
decreases, whereas volume Vd increases. Since wea &lt; wed, there are indications that
the total field energy increases. However, filling the space between the plates by
</p>
<p>dielectric material increases the equivalent capacitance C &frac14; Q/U, as it is propor-
tional to the permittivity of the dielectric material filling the space between the
</p>
<p>plates. Since the charge Q is constant, an increase in the capacitance will cause a
</p>
<p>decrease of the voltage. As a consequence, the fields E will reduce. Spatial density
</p>
<p>of the field energy depends on the square of the field strength. Therefore, it can
</p>
<p>be concluded that a deeper insertion of the dielectric reduces the total energy of the
</p>
<p>electrical field. These considerations can be verified by an analysis of the expres-
</p>
<p>sion for field energy We(x),

</p>
<p>which shows that in the case of a constant Q, total field energy decreases when the
</p>
<p>value of x rises, that is, when a piece of dielectric is pushed further into the space

<p>between the plates.

<p>2.9 Piezoelectric Effect
</p>
<p>Applying pressure on a crystal of silicon will induce charges on its surfaces and
</p>
<p>give rise to voltage between surfaces (Fig. 2.9). This phenomenon is known as
</p>
<p>piezoelectric effect. In a piezoelectric microphone, sound waves cause variable
</p>
<p>pressure of air against the surface of a crystal. As a consequence, variable forces act
</p>
<p>upon the crystal. A voltage which represents electrical image of the sound appears
</p>
<p>across the ends of the crystal. This voltage can be amplified and processed further.
</p>
<p>It is possible to manufacture a crystal with linear dependence between the
</p>
<p>voltage across the crystal and the applied force. Such crystal can be used for
</p>
<p>designing precise electronic scales (weight-measuring devices).
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.9 Variation of pressure acting on sides of a crystal leads to variations of the voltage
measured between the surfaces
</p>
<p>2.9 Piezoelectric Effect 37</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The inverse piezoelectric effect can be used in electromechanical conversion.
</p>
<p>If the surfaces of the crystal are covered by conducting plates connected to a
</p>
<p>variable voltage, a force varying in accordance with the variable voltage will
</p>
<p>appear. This effect can be used for creating very small displacements controlled
</p>
<p>by the applied voltage. If the connected voltage represents a record of sound,
</p>
<p>variations of the force will cause vibrations of the crystal surfaces and change the
</p>
<p>pressure of air against the surfaces, thus operating the piezoelectric loudspeakers.
</p>
<p>In a piezoelectric device, the crystal surface moves by a fraction of millimeter.
</p>
<p>Motors based on piezoelectric effect are used in motion control applications with
</p>
<p>very small displacements and with very high precision, such as positioning the
</p>
<p>reading heads in hard disk drives.
</p>
<p>2.10 Magnetostriction
</p>
<p>One of the principles applicable for electromechanical conversion is magnetostric-
</p>
<p>tion. In general, magnetization of ferromagnetic materials can change their shape and
</p>
<p>dimensions. This phenomenon is called magnetostriction. The length of the ferro-
</p>
<p>magnetic rod shown in Fig. 2.10 will change with the applied magnetic field. The
</p>
<p>effect gives a rise to a force. Multiplied by mechanical displacement, the force
</p>
<p>produces mechanical work. Yet, few electromechanical converters are based on
</p>
<p>magnetostriction because of rather small displacements and a poor power-to-weight
</p>
<p>ratio. Conventional electrical machines and power transformers usually have mag-
</p>
<p>netic circuits made of iron sheets, wherein magnetic field pulsates at the line
</p>
<p>frequency (50 Hz/60 Hz). The effect of magnetostriction causes magnetic circuits
</p>
<p>to vibrate.With themagnetostrictive forces proportional to the square of themagnetic
</p>
<p>field strength, the vibration frequency is twice the line frequency (100 Hz/120 Hz).
</p>
<p>These vibrations cause waves of variable air pressure and sound which are experi-
</p>
<p>enced as humming, frequently encountered with electrical equipment.
</p>
<p>The phenomenon reciprocal to magnetostriction is the change of permeability in
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic materials subjected to mechanical stress. Namely, the stress due to
</p>
<p>external forces will change magnetic properties of the material. When an external
</p>
<p>force is applied to an iron rod, the same magnetic field strength H will result in an
</p>
<p>increased magnetic induction (flux density) B. This phenomenon is called the Villari
</p>
<p>effect. By applying the described principle, it is possible to measure the stress in the
</p>
<p>elements of steel constructions such as the bridges or skyscrapers.

</p>
<p>Magnetic and Electrical Coupling Field
</p>
<p>Electromechanical conversion is based on forces and torques of electromagnetic
</p>
<p>origin. The force exerted upon a moving part can be the consequence of electrical or
</p>
<p>magnetic field. The field encircles and couples both moving and nonmoving parts of
</p>
<p>electromechanical converter. Therefore, the field is also called coupling field. In this
</p>
<p>chapter, some basic notions are given for electromechanical energy converters with
</p>
<p>electrical coupling field and converters with magnetic coupling field.
</p>
<p>3.1 Converters Based on Electrostatic Field
</p>
<p>Electromechanical conversion in electrostatic machines is based on electrical
</p>
<p>coupling field. The coupling field between moving parts is a prerequisite for electro-
</p>
<p>mechanical conversion. In an electrostatic machine, the field exists in the medium
</p>
<p>between mobile electrodes, and it causes electrical forces acting on the electrodes.
</p>
<p>Preliminary insight in electromechanical energy conversion based on the electrical
</p>
<p>field can be obtained by considering the sample machine shown in Fig. 3.1, resem-
</p>
<p>bling the capacitor with two parallel metal plates. In the case when the plates are
</p>
<p>considerably larger compared to the distance between them (S &gt;&gt; d2), the electrical
field between the electrodes is homogeneous and equal to E &frac14; U/d [V/m], where
U is the voltage between the electrodes. Electrical induction vector D [As/m2]
</p>
<p>is obtained by multiplying the vector of electric field E by the permittivity of
</p>
<p>the medium e0. The force acting on the plates depends on the charge stored in the
</p>
<p>capacitor. If it is possible to move one of the plates, then the product of this force and
</p>
<p>the displacement gives mechanical work. The mechanical work can be obtained at
</p>
<p>the expense of the field energy or of energy of a source connected to the plates.

<p>3.1.1 Charge, Capacitance, and Energy
</p>
<p>The electrical field in the interelectrode space is homogeneous. The field strength is
</p>
<p>determined by the ratio of the voltage and distance between the plates, E &frac14; U/d.
Electrical induction D is equal to the surface charge density Q/S. At the same time,
</p>
<p>the ratio D/E is determined by permittivity (dielectric constant) e0.

<p>3.1.2 Source Work, Mechanical Work, and Field Energy
</p>
<p>Figure 3.2 shows a charged capacitor havingmobile upper plate. It can be shown that
</p>
<p>by moving the upper plate downward, electrical energy is converted to mechanical
</p>
<p>work. The electric charge on the plates is of opposite polarity. Therefore, they are
</p>
<p>subjected to a force of attraction F. If the upper plate moves downward and gets
</p>
<p>closer to the lower plate by Dx, mechanical work FDx is obtained. During the move,
</p>
<p>there is a change in the energy We of the electrical coupling field. With the plates
</p>
<p>connected to the electrical source, the charge on the plates changes through an
</p>
<p>exchange of charges between the plates and the electrical source.
</p>
<p>Electric force F acting on one plate of the capacitor can be determined by
</p>
<p>applying the method of virtual works, also called virtual disturbance method. It is
</p>
<p>necessary to envisage a very small displacement Dx of the mobile plate toward
</p>
<p>the opposing plate. In such case, the direction of the force F corresponds to the
</p>
<p>direction of the hypothetical displacement Dx. The method of virtual works pro-
</p>
<p>ceeds with calculation of changes in the field energy and determines the work of the
</p>
<p>electrical source. The work DWmeh &frac14; FDx is made by the electric force F during
displacement Dx. The force can be calculated by dividing the work increment
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.2 A capacitor having mobile upper plate
</p>
<p>3.1 Converters Based on Electrostatic Field 43</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>DWmeh by the displacement Dx. The same virtual work method can be applied in
</p>
<p>cases when the mobile part of the electromechanical converter performs rotation.
</p>
<p>In such cases, the displacement Dx is replaced by the angular shift Dy, while the
</p>
<p>mechanical works DWmeh assume the form TemDy. The symbol Tem designates
</p>
<p>the torque generated by the electrical forces. The torque Tem acts upon the moving
</p>
<p>(revolving) part and affects its speed.
</p>
<p>A source of the constant voltage U, shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 3.2, can
</p>
<p>be connected to the plates by closing the switch. Reduction of the distance d between
</p>
<p>the plates increases capacitance C. While the source is connected, the voltage
</p>
<p>between the plates is constant. Due to an increase of the capacitance, the charge
</p>
<p>on the plates Q &frac14; CU increases. Therefore, the source supplies an additional
charge DQ. The work of the source is equal to DWi &frac14; UDQ, while the obtained
mechanical work is DWmeh &frac14; FDx. The work of the source increases total energy of
the system, that is, the sum of the electrical energy and mechanical work. With a
</p>
<p>constant voltage, the electrical energy is given by (3.4).
</p>
<p>In the next considerations, it will be shown that work of the source is divided in
</p>
<p>two equal parts, that is, DWe &frac14; DWmeh &frac14; &frac12;DWi.
If the switch in Fig. 3.2 is open, the source is separated from the plates, and the
</p>
<p>work of the source is equal to zero. Electrical charges on the plates cannot be
</p>
<p>changed, as well as the field D between the plates (Q &frac14; const., D &frac14; const.).
Therefore, the density of the field energy we &frac14; &frac12;D2/e0 remains unchanged.
</p>
<p>By reducing the distance between the plates, the volume of the region compris-
</p>
<p>ing the electrical field is reduced as well. Therefore, the total field energy DWe is
</p>
<p>also reduced. With the source separated from the system, reduction in the field
</p>
<p>energy yields the mechanical work DWmeh &frac14; �DWe. In the case of a constant
charge, the field electrical energy is given by (3.5):

<p>3.1.3 Force Expression
</p>
<p>The machines operating with the electrical coupling field are called electrostatic
</p>
<p>machines. Domain with the electrical field is filled with dielectric material. Dielec-
</p>
<p>tric is called linear if the vector of electrical inductionD is proportional to the vector
</p>
<p>E, D &frac14; eE. Electrostatic machine with linear dielectric is called linear machine.
The structure shown in Fig. 3.2 represents a linear electrostatic machine with
</p>
<p>negligible energy losses. Therefore, in the case with Q &frac14; const., the mechanical
</p>
<p>44 3 Magnetic and Electrical Coupling Field</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>work DWmeh &frac14; FDx is determined by DWmeh &frac14; �DWe, whereas in the case of a
constant voltage relation, DWmeh &frac14; +DWe &frac14; +&frac12;DWi applies. According to these
expressions, the force can be determined as partial derivative of the coupling field
</p>
<p>energy We with respect to coordinate x. This coordinate represents displacement of
</p>
<p>the mobile electrode along the motion axis of the system.
</p>
<p>In the case when the source is disconnected, the system in Fig. 3.2 has a constant
</p>
<p>charge, and the work of the source U is equal to zero. Applying the method of
</p>
<p>virtual works, the change in the field energy and the mechanical work are obtained

<p>If the source is connected, the voltage across the plates is constant. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the shift of the mobile electrode changes the capacitance C and the charge Q. The

<p>Question (3.1): Equation 3.7 gives force F acting on the mobile electrode in the
case when the source is disconnected, whereas (3.9) gives this force when the source
</p>
<p>is connected. Note that in both cases, the same result is obtained, proportional toQ2.
</p>
<p>Is it possible that the force acting on the mobile electrode does depend on source U
</p>
<p>being connected or disconnected? Provide an explanation.
</p>
<p>Answer (3.1): The electrical force acting on the mobile plate can be represented as
a sum of forces acting on electrical charges distributed over the plate surface.
</p>
<p>Individual forces are dependent on the density of electrical charge and the field
</p>
<p>strength in the vicinity of the plate. It is necessary to compare the force obtained
</p>
<p>with the source U connected to the force obtained with the source detached from
</p>
<p>the plates. If the plates accommodate the same electrical charge Q in both cases, the
</p>
<p>surface charge density remains the same. The surface charge density determines
</p>
<p>the electrical induction D. Therefore, in both cases, the electrical field strength
</p>
<p>E &frac14; D/e0 is the same. From this, it can be concluded that in both cases the same
force acts on the mobile plate.
</p>
<p>3.1.4 Conversion Cycle
</p>
<p>In the preceding section, it has been shown that the electromechanical conversion
</p>
<p>can be performed in two different modes. With the source disconnected, mechani-
</p>
<p>cal work DWmeh is obtained on account of the energy accumulated in the coupling
</p>
<p>field, DWmeh &frac14; �DWe. If the source is connected, the work of the source DWi is
divided in two equal parts, that is, DWe &frac14; DWmeh &frac14; &frac12; DWi. Graphical representa-
tion of electromechanical conversion is shown in Fig. 3.3. It is of interest to note
</p>
<p>that none of the two presented modes can last continuously.
</p>
<p>If the source is connected, the electromechanical conversion is performed by
</p>
<p>turning one part of the source work into mechanical energy, whereas the rest of the
</p>
<p>46 3 Magnetic and Electrical Coupling Field</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>source work increases the energy stored within the coupling field. The field energy
</p>
<p>We is dependent of the density we &frac14; &frac12;e0E2 and the volume of the domain where the
field exists. There is an upper limit to the field energy. The maximum strength of
</p>
<p>the electrical field is limited by the dielectric strength of the material. The maxi-
</p>
<p>mum electrical field in the air is Emax � 30 kV/cm. Exceeding the maximum field
strength leads to dielectric breakdown, wherein the electrical current passes through
</p>
<p>the dielectric material and creates an electrical arc. The breakdown results in
</p>
<p>destruction and permanent damage. Therefore, the field strength and the field
</p>
<p>energy density we have to be limited. The volume of the domain is also restricted
</p>
<p>and defined by the surface of the plates and the distance between them. Therefore,
</p>
<p>there is a limit We(max) to the field energy, and it cannot be exceeded. For this
</p>
<p>reason, it is not possible to withstand a permanent growth of the field energy.
</p>
<p>Hence, the operation where the source is connected cannot go on indefinitely.
</p>
<p>In the case when the source is not connected, mechanical work is obtained on
</p>
<p>account of the field energy. This energy decreases, and the operation would eventu-
</p>
<p>ally stop when the field energy is exhausted. Therefore, the operation where the
</p>
<p>source is disconnected cannot hold indefinitely.
</p>
<p>When the need exists for a continuous operation of an electromechanical
</p>
<p>converter, it is necessary to use concurrently both operating modes. Namely, they
</p>
<p>should be altered in cycles by switching the source on and off. An interval of
</p>
<p>operation when the source is connected (on) is followed by another interval when
</p>
<p>the source is disconnected from the converter (off). In such way, it is possible to
</p>
<p>provide mechanical work in a continuous manner while keeping the field energy
</p>
<p>from either reaching We(max) or dropping to zero. Hence, the process of electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical conversion is mostly performed in cycles. Cyclic exchange of the two
</p>
<p>operating modes is illustrated in Fig. 3.3. In rotating electrical machines, one
</p>
<p>conversion cycle corresponds to one revolution of the rotor (sometimes, one fraction
</p>
<p>of the rotor revolution).
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.3 One cycle of electromechanical conversion includes phase (a) when the plates of the
capacitor are disconnected from the source U and phase (b) when the plates are connected to
the source

<p>Question (3.2): Estimate the mechanical work obtained during one cycle with
electromechanical converter made of a plate capacitor with one mobile plate.
</p>
<p>The dimensions of the plates and minimum and maximum distances between the
</p>
<p>plates are known, while the maximum electrical field strength in the dielectric is
</p>
<p>Emax &frac14; 30 kV/cm.
Answer (3.2): The maximum work obtainable in one cycle is determined by the
maximum energy of the coupling field. The surface of the plates S, maximum
</p>
<p>distance between the plates d, and maximum energy density of the coupling field
</p>
<p>we &frac14; &frac12;e0Em2 are known. The mechanical work which can be obtained within one
cycle is DW &frac14; S d we(max).
Question (3.3): If a converter makes f cycles per second, estimate its average
power.
</p>
<p>Answer (3.3): Average power of the converter making f cycles per second is
Pa v &frac14; fDW &frac14; f S d we(max).
</p>
<p>3.1.5 Energy Density of Electrical and Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>The power of an electromechanical converter is dependent on the density of energy
</p>
<p>accumulated within the coupling field. A converter of given dimensions will have
</p>
<p>higher average power if its coupling field has a higher energy density. Given the
</p>
<p>converter power, dimensions and mass will be reduced for an increased density of
</p>
<p>energy. The power-to-size ratio is also called specific power. The considerations
</p>
<p>which follow show that electromechanical converters involving magnetic coupling
</p>
<p>field possess higher specific power compared to electrostatic machines.
</p>
<p>Themechanical work obtained within one cycle of electromechanical converter is
</p>
<p>dependent on the energy stored in the coupling field. The maximum amount of the
</p>
<p>field energy is dependent on the energy density and the volume of the converter.
</p>
<p>If two electrical machines of the same size are considered, the machine with higher
</p>
<p>density of the field energy will produce higher mechanical work within each conver-
</p>
<p>sion cycle. If the repetition rates of conversion cycles are the same for the two
</p>
<p>machines, themachine having higher energy density will have higher average power.
</p>
<p>The energy density of magnetic field exceeds by large the density of energy in
</p>
<p>electrical field. Permittivity (D/E) in vacuum is e0 &frac14; 8.85�10�12 � 10�11, whereas
permeability (B/H) amounts m0 &frac14; 4p�10
</p>
<p>�7 � 10�6. Therefore, the energy density
of magnetic field wm &frac14; m0H
</p>
<p>2/2 is considerably higher than the energy density of
</p>
<p>electrical field we &frac14; e0E
2/2. For this reason, electrical machines are mostly
</p>
<p>operating with magnetic coupling field.
</p>
<p>Density of energy accumulated in the coupling field depends on the square of the
</p>
<p>field strength. In air, electrical field is limited by dielectric strength, Emax � 30
kV/cm � 3MV/m. In electrical machines with magnetic field, the field is comprised
by magnetic circuit including air gaps and ferromagnetic materials such as iron.
</p>
<p>48 3 Magnetic and Electrical Coupling Field</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Magnetic inductance B in ferromagnetic materials is limited to Bmax &frac14; 1&ndash;2 T, thus
limiting the magnetic inductance achievable in air. Consequently, the maximum
</p>
<p>field strength H which can be met in electrical machines is close to Hmax � Bmax/
m0 � 1 MA/m. With e0 � 10
</p>
<p>�11 and m0 � 10
�6, the achievable energy density is
</p>
<p>much higher in the case of magnetic field. Considering two electromechanical
</p>
<p>converters of the same size, the converter operating with magnetic field could
</p>
<p>accumulate much higher energy in the coupling field (103&ndash;104 times) and propor-
</p>
<p>tionally higher average power of electromechanical conversion.
</p>
<p>3.1.6 Coupling Field and Transfer of Energy
</p>
<p>It is of interest to note that both the electromechanical energy conversion with
</p>
<p>magnetic coupling field and the conversion with electrical field involve both field
</p>
<p>vectors, electrical field vector E and magnetic field vector H. The exchange of
</p>
<p>energy between electrical and mechanical terminals of electrical machine implies
</p>
<p>that in the space surrounding the moving part of the machine, there is transfer of
</p>
<p>energy toward the moving part (motor) or from the moving part (generator). The
</p>
<p>energy transfer through the surrounding space is measured by Poynting vector.
</p>
<p>Hence, the energy streams through domain if the Poynting vector has a nonzero
</p>
<p>algebraic intensity. Poynting vector is equal to the vector product of the electrical
</p>
<p>and magnetic field. It represents the surface density of power, and it is expressed in
</p>
<p>W/m2. Surface integral of Poynting vector over a surface separating two domains
</p>
<p>represents the rate of energy transfer from one to the other domain (i.e., the power
</p>
<p>passed from one domain to another). The course and direction of Poynting vector
</p>
<p>indicate the course and direction of energy transfer. In the absence of either
</p>
<p>electrical field E or magnetic field H, Poynting vector is equal to zero; thus, no
</p>
<p>energy transfer is possible. Therefrom, the question arises on how do electrical
</p>
<p>machines with electrical coupling field acquire magnetic field H required for
</p>
<p>mandatory Poynting vector.
</p>
<p>In an electromechanical converter involving electrical coupling field which is at
</p>
<p>the state of rest, the magnetic field will be equal to zero and so will be Poynting
</p>
<p>vector. This is an expected situation since the power of electromechanical conver-
</p>
<p>sion is zero in the case when mobile parts of the converter do not move. Namely, the
</p>
<p>power is equal to the product of the force and speed of motion. At rest, although
</p>
<p>the electrical force may be present, the speed is equal to zero, thus resulting in zero
</p>
<p>mechanical power. If the considered converter is in the state of motion, its mobile
</p>
<p>part moves in the electrical coupling field. This leads to variations in the field
</p>
<p>strength E and the electrical induction D within the converter. The first time
</p>
<p>derivative of D contributes to the spatial derivative (i.e., curl) of magnetic field H.
</p>
<p>The second Maxwell equation expresses generalized Ampere law, and it reads
</p>
<p>rot ~H &frac14; ~J &thorn;
@~D
</p>
<p>@t
: (3.10)
</p>
<p>3.1 Converters Based on Electrostatic Field 49</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Since a nonzero spatial derivative of the field H exists, algebraic intensity of
</p>
<p>the vector H cannot be equal to zero at all points of the considered domain. The
</p>
<p>conclusion is that a certain magnetic field H exists in electrostatic machines in
</p>
<p>the state of motion. The field strength H is proportional to the speed of the machine
</p>
<p>moving parts. In conjunction with the field E, magnetic field H results in Poynting
</p>
<p>vector P &frac14; E � H.
The same considerations can be derived for an electromechanical converter
</p>
<p>based on magnetic coupling field. At rest, the magnetic field H exists in the
</p>
<p>converter, but the electrical field E and Poynting vector P are equal to zero. With
</p>
<p>P &frac14; 0, there is no flow of energy toward the mobile part of the machine, and the
mechanical power is equal to zero. This corresponds to the conclusion that
</p>
<p>the mechanical power at rest must be zero, as it is the product of the force and
</p>
<p>the speed. When the considered converter is in the state of motion, its mobile parts
</p>
<p>move in the magnetic coupling field. This leads to variations in the magnetic field
</p>
<p>H and the magnetic induction B within the converter. The first Maxwell equation
</p>
<p>expresses the Faraday law in differential form, and it reads
</p>
<p>rot ~E &frac14; �
@~B
</p>
<p>@t
: (3.11)
</p>
<p>Hence, the variation of magnetic induction B results in the spatial derivative
</p>
<p>(curl) of electrical field, which causes the appearance of the electrical field E within
</p>
<p>the converter and leads to nonzero values of the Poynting vector.
</p>
<p>3.2 Converter Involving Magnetic Coupling Field
</p>
<p>Electromechanical conversion in converters involving magnetic coupling field is
</p>
<p>possible by means of the field acting on the mobile windings and mobile parts made
</p>
<p>of ferromagnetic materials. In such converters, magnetic field is a precondition for
</p>
<p>electromechanical conversion of energy. It exists in the space between the station-
</p>
<p>ary and mobile parts of magnetic circuits and current circuits. The mobile parts can
</p>
<p>perform either linear or rotational movement.
</p>
<p>Forces acting on mobile parts are dependent on the magnetic induction and
</p>
<p>current in conductors. Mechanical work can be obtained on account of the field
</p>
<p>energy or work of the source which is connected to the current carrying conductors.
</p>

</p>
<p>magnetic field and a straight part of the conductor performing linear motion.

<p>the electrical energy, obtained from a constant voltage source U, is converted to

<p>mechanical work.Mobile conductor AB of length l1 touches fixed parallel conductors
</p>
<p>connected to the source U. The mobile conductor AB, fixed parallel conductors, and
</p>
<p>sourceUmake current circuit shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 3.4. The resistance
</p>
<p>of conductor AB can be neglected, whereas the sum of resistances of all remaining
</p>
<p>conductors in the current circuit is denoted by R.
</p>
<p>The source U causes the current i in the circuit. Direction of the current
</p>
<p>corresponds to the direction of vector l1 shown in Fig. 3.4 along conductor AB.
</p>
<p>The conductor is placed in an external1 homogeneous magnetic field of induction
</p>
<p>B. The electromagnetic force Fm acting on the conductor is determined by (3.12):
</p>
<p>~Fm &frac14; i ~l1 � ~B
� �
</p>
<p>: (3.12)
</p>
<p>Since vector l1 is orthogonal to the vector of magnetic induction, algebraic
</p>
<p>intensity of the force is equal to Fm &frac14; l1iB. The electromagnetic force in Fig. 3.4
is directed from left to right. It is assumed that the force makes the conductor move
</p>
<p>in the same direction at a speed v. The conductor is subjected to an external force
</p>
<p>Fex, which opposes this movement. In the state of dynamic equilibrium, accelera-
</p>
<p>tion of the conductor is zero, the speed of motion v is constant, and the sum of the
</p>
<p>forces acting on the conductor is equal to zero. Therefore, the algebraic intensities

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>While the conductor moves in magnetic field, the electromotive force eAB
is induced between its ends. Electrical field Eind induced in the conductor is
</p>
<p>determined by the vector product of the speed v and magnetic induction B. Since
</p>
<p>the vector of the induced field does not vary along the conductor, the electromotive
</p>
<p>force e &frac14; eAB can be calculated from (3.14):

</p>
<p>: (3.14)

<p>Vector of the induced electrical field is collinear with the conductor. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the electromotive force is equal to e &frac14; l1vB. The sign of the induced electromotive
force e &frac14; eAB is related to the adopted reference direction, shown in Fig. 3.4.
Positive value of the electromotive force, e &frac14; eAB &gt; 0, acts toward increasing
the potential at the conductor end A with respect to the potential at the end B.
</p>
<p>Current i &frac14; (U � e)/R exists in the circuit shown in the Fig. 3.4. At steady state,
time varying electrical current i(t) assumes a constant value I &frac14; (U � l1vB)/R.
Power of the source Pi &frac14; Ui &frac14; ei + Ri
</p>
<p>2 contains the component PAB &frac14; ei &frac14; l1vB
as well as the losses Pg&frac14;Ri
</p>
<p>2. The losses in conductors are caused by Joule effect, and
</p>
<p>they depend on the equivalent resistance and square of the current. The remaining
</p>
<p>power PAB is transferred to the moving conductor. By maintaining the movement,
</p>
<p>electromagnetic force Fm performs the work against external force Fex which is
</p>
<p>opposite to motion. Vectors of the force and speed of motion are collinear. There-
</p>
<p>fore, the mechanical power is equal to Pmeh &frac14; Fmv &frac14; l1ivB. Power Pmeh is the
output power of the electromechanical converter which converts electrical energy
</p>
<p>obtained from the source U to mechanical work. Since Pmeh &frac14; Fmv &frac14; PAB &frac14; ei &frac14;
l1vBi, distribution of the source power Pi can be described by expression
</p>
<p>Pi &frac14; Ui &frac14; ei&thorn; Ri
2 &frac14; Fmv&thorn; Ri
</p>
<p>2 &frac14; Pmeh &thorn; Ri
2: (3.15)
</p>
<p>Therefore, power from the source is divided in the thermal losses and mechanical
</p>
<p>power, the latter being the result of electromechanical conversion. The power
</p>
<p>delivered by the induced electromotive force e is equal to Pe &frac14; e(�i) &frac14; �ei &lt; 0.
Consequently, the electromotive force e behaves as a receiver, taking over the
</p>
<p>electrical power ei &frac14; l1vBi which is then converted to mechanical power Pmeh &frac14;
Fmv &frac14; ei. In the presented example, the mechanical power of the electromechanical
converter is equal to the product of the electromotive force and current. Equa-
</p>
<p>tion 3.16 in certain form is present in all electrical machines:
</p>
<p>ei &frac14; Fmv: (3.16)
</p>
<p>Joule losses are determined by the power Pg &frac14; Ri
2, and they are turned into heat.
</p>
<p>Conductors and other parts of the converter are heated. Compared to ambient
</p>
<p>temperature, their temperatures are increased. Due to elevated temperatures, these
</p>
<p>parts of the converter transfer their heat to the ambient by convection, conduction,
</p>
<p>or radiation. When the power of losses Pg becomes equal to the heat power
</p>
<p>transferred to the ambient, the temperature increase stops and the system enters
</p>
<p>the thermal equilibrium. Since the electromechanical converters are used for
</p>
<p>52 3 Magnetic and Electrical Coupling Field</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>converting electrical energy to mechanical work, it is necessary to keep the
</p>
<p>conversion losses as small as possible. Due to thermal losses, the coefficient of
</p>
<p>efficiency � of power converters is reduced. In addition, generated heat has to be
removed so that the converter does not become overheated. It is required, therefore,
</p>
<p>to have a corresponding solution for heat transfer and cooling. The losses can be
</p>
<p>reduced by decreasing the equivalent resistance R. However, reducing resistance by
</p>
<p>increasing the cross section of conductors leads to an increased consumption of
</p>
<p>copper, increasing in this way the cost, weight, and size of converters.
</p>
<p>The power converter shown in Fig. 3.4 can also run in generator mode. Direction
</p>
<p>of the current will be reversed and also direction of the electromagnetic force.
</p>
<p>In order to support the motion, direction of the external force Fex has to be changed
</p>
<p>as well. In generator mode, mechanical power is converted to electrical energy.
</p>
<p>Generator operation is analyzed in more detail in Sect. 2.4.
</p>
<p>3.2.2 Rotational Converter
</p>
<p>Electromechanical conversion is most frequently performed by using rotational
</p>
<p>machines, which convert electrical energy to mechanical work of rotational move-
</p>
<p>ment. An example of simple rotational converter is shown in Fig. 3.5. Contour
</p>
<p>ABCD is made out of copper conductors. It has dimensions D � L, and it rotates in
homogeneous external magnetic field B. The contour rotates clockwise around
</p>
<p>horizontal axis, shown in Fig. 3.5. The position of the contour is determined by
</p>
<p>angle ym, and it varies at the rate Om &frac14; dym/dt, where Om represents the angular

<p>speed in rad/s. At certain instant, the contour is in position ym &frac14; 0, when lines of
the magnetic field are parallel to surface S &frac14; D � L, surrounded by the contour.
Terminals of the contour are connected to power supply which provides the current
</p>
<p>I in the conductor.
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic force F1 acts on parts AB and CD of the conductive contour.
</p>
<p>These parts are of length L and are orthogonal to the magnetic field; thus, the force is
</p>
<p>determined by expression F1 &frac14; LIB. The electromagnetic force does not act on the
transversal parts BC andDAof lengthD, because the current in these parts is collinear
</p>
<p>with the magnetic field. At position ym &frac14; p/2, the transversal parts BC and DA are
subjected to the actions of forces in the direction of rotation, but the forces are
</p>
<p>collinear and of opposite directions; therefore, their actions are mutually canceled.
</p>
<p>The couple of electromagnetic forces in Fig. 3.5 creates the torque Tem &frac14; DF1.
Assuming that the contour rotates with angular frequency Om &frac14; dym/dt, the
developed mechanical power at the considered instant (t &frac14; 0, ym &frac14; 0) is equal
to Pmeh &frac14; TemOm &frac14; DLIBOm. Power Pmeh is the output power of the electrome-
chanical converter which converts the electrical energy obtained from the supply I
</p>
<p>to mechanical work.
</p>
<p>It is of interest to compare the obtained mechanical power with the electrical
</p>
<p>power taken from the source. Between terminals A1 and D1 of the constant current
</p>
<p>source I, there is voltage u &frac14; vA1 � vD1. The source is connected to the contour
ABCD, and the voltage is u &frac14; RI + dF/dt, whereF denotes the flux through surface
S encircled by the contour, while R denotes the equivalent resistance of the
</p>
<p>conductors making the contour. Reference direction of the flux is the direction of
</p>
<p>the positive normal n to surface S. This normal is in accordance with the direction
</p>
<p>of circulation along the contour ABCD, that is, the current in designated direction of
</p>
<p>circulation along the contour creates a magnetic field which is aligned with the
</p>
<p>normal n. In Figs. 3.5 and 3.6, the normal is denoted by vector n. The contour can
</p>
<p>rotate around horizontal axis; thus, the flux through the surface S depends upon
</p>
<p>the angle ym between the vectors of magnetic induction and the plane in which the
</p>
<p>surface S reclines.
</p>
<p>In accordance with the notation in Fig. 3.6, the angle ym is equal to zero at the
</p>
<p>position where the magnetic field is parallel to the surface S. In zero position, fluxF
</p>
<p>is equal to zero. When the contour makes an angular shift of ym, the normal n to
</p>
<p>surface S is shifted to position n1. Assuming that the external field is homogeneous,
</p>
<p>F can be represented by the expression F(ym) &frac14; Fmsin(ym) &frac14; Fmsin(Omt), where
Fm &frac14; BS is the maximum value of flux which is attained at position ym &frac14; p/2. By
using the obtained expression for the flux, the voltage across the terminals of the
</p>
<p>source is calculated as u &frac14; RI + OmFmcos(Omt). At position ym &frac14; 0, the power
delivered by the source I to the converter is given in (3.17):

</p>
<p>Therefore, the power of the source I is partially converted to mechanical power,
</p>
<p>whereas the remaining part accounts for conversion losses that are turned into heat

<p>due to Joule effect. At position ym &frac14; 0, the electromagnetic torque acting on the
contour is equal to Tem &frac14; FmI &frac14; Pmeh/Om. After the angle is shifted to ym, the arm
K of force F1 is shown in Fig. 3.6, and it is equal to K &frac14; (D/2)cosym. Therefore,
torque Tem varies as function of angle ym in accordance with (3.18):
</p>
<p>Tem &frac14; FmI cos ym: (3.18)
</p>
<p>Equations similar to (3.18) determine the electromagnetic torque of all rotating
</p>
<p>electrical machines. The analysis of operation of the converter shown in Fig. 3.5
</p>
<p>leads to the conclusion that the average value of the torque during one full revolu-
</p>
<p>tion is zero. This can be changed by insertion of additional contours or by changing
</p>
<p>the supply current, as will be elaborated in due course.
</p>
<p>By changing the direction of the current or direction of rotation, the electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical converter shown in Fig. 3.5 will operate in the generator mode of operation,
</p>
<p>converting mechanical work to electrical energy. Voltage and current of the current

<p>energy.

</p>
<p>(abbreviated CEMF), and it refers to the induced voltage that acts in opposition to the electrical
</p>
<p>current which induces it. BEMF is caused by changes in magnetic field, and it is described by Lenz
</p>
<p>law. The only difference between the electromotive force (EMF) and BEMF is the reference

<p>determines the sign of the induced electromotive force, as well as its connection
</p>
<p>in the equivalent scheme of the electric circuit; thus, it is useful to give the
</p>
<p>corresponding explanation and expressions for the induced electromotive force in
</p>
<p>both cases.
</p>
<p>Figure 3.7 shows the equivalent scheme of the mobile contour, fed from a
</p>
<p>constant current source via terminals A1 and D1. Character F denotes flux through
</p>
<p>the surface S encircled by the contour. Reference direction for the flux is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the normal on the surface S, denoted by n in Figs. 3.5 and 3.6.
</p>
<p>The normal n is aligned with the magnetic field created by the current I which
</p>
<p>circulates along the contour (ABCD) in designated direction. FluxF depends on the
</p>
<p>angle ym. Rotation of the contour in the direction indicated in Fig. 3.5 leads to a
</p>
<p>growth of the flux F that the external magnetic field makes through the surface S.
</p>
<p>The total magnetic flux through the surface S depends on the external magnetic
</p>
<p>field B, but it also changes with the current that circulates within the contour.
</p>
<p>Namely, the contour current creates a magnetic field of its own, and this field
</p>
<p>contributes to the total magnetic flux. The total flux can be expressed by F &frac14; LI +
BS sin(ym). The coefficient L defines the ratio between the fluxF and the current I in
</p>
<p>cases where the external magnetic field does not exist. The ratio L &frac14; F(I)/I is called
the self-inductance of the contour.
</p>
<p>Each change of the flux F induces an electromotive force in the contour. This
</p>
<p>electromotive force depends on the first time derivative of the flux. Under the action
</p>
<p>of electromotive force, a current appears in the contour. The intensity of this current
</p>
<p>depends upon the equivalent resistance of the circuit. In the case shown in Fig. 3.7,
</p>
<p>the contour is fed from a constant current source. The equivalent resistance of a
</p>
<p>constant current source is Req &frac14; 1; thus, presence of an electromotive force e1
does not cause any change of current. In the case when the contour is galvanically
</p>
<p>closed, that is, when terminals A1 and D1 are short-circuited or connected to a
</p>
<p>voltage source or a receiver of finite equivalent resistance, the presence of
</p>
<p>electromotive force e1 will cause a change of current and a change of flux.
</p>
<p>According to Lenz rule, electromotive forces are induced in coils due to changes
</p>
<p>in magnetic flux. Electrical currents appear as a consequence of induced electro-
</p>
<p>motive forces. Induced currents oppose to the flux change and tend to maintain the
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.7 Definition of reference direction for electromotive and back electromotive forces
</p>
<p>56 3 Magnetic and Electrical Coupling Field</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>initial flux value. Electrical current in a coil creates magnetic field and the flux
</p>
<p>which is proportional to the self-inductance of the coil. Direction of this self-flux is
</p>
<p>opposite to the original flux change. Hence, the induced electromotive force
</p>
<p>produces the current and the self-flux in direction that tends to cancel the original
</p>
<p>flux change. For that reason, induced electromotive forces are also called counter-
</p>
<p>electromotive forces or back electromotive forces.
</p>
<p>Considering the setup in Fig. 3.5, during rotation of the contour in the direction
</p>
<p>indicated in the figure, the flux due to external magnetic field rises. Electromotive
</p>
<p>force e1, given by (3.19), appears in the contour:
</p>
<p>e1 &frac14; �
dF
</p>
<p>dt
: (3.19)
</p>
<p>Since an increase of the flux results in e1 &lt; 0, a current appears opposite to
the direction of circulation along the galvanically closed contour ABCD. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the induced current creates its own magnetic field and the self-flux of the contour
</p>
<p>in the direction opposite to the indicated normal n. Total flux is equal to the sum
</p>
<p>of fluxes due to external field, which is growing, and the self-flux which is of nega-
</p>
<p>tive sign.
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic induction opposes to changes of the flux to the degree which
</p>
<p>depends on the circuit parameters. When the equivalent resistance of the circuit is
</p>
<p>Req &frac14; 1, the induced electromotive force does not cause any change in electrical
current which would have opposed to changes in the flux. In cases when the
</p>
<p>equivalent resistance of the contour is zero (Req &frac14; 0, the case of a superconductive
contour with short-circuited terminals), the phenomenon of electromagnetic induc-
</p>
<p>tion prevents any changes of flux. Since the voltage balance equation is given in
</p>
<p>(3.20)
</p>
<p>u &frac14; Ri� e1 &frac14; Ri&thorn;
dF
</p>
<p>dt
; (3.20)
</p>
<p>in conditions with u &frac14; 0 and R &frac14; 0, the flux cannot change due to dF/dt &frac14; 0.
Therefore, notwithstanding eventual changes in the external magnetic field, the
</p>
<p>total flux through a short-circuited superconductive contour is constant.
</p>
<p>For a contour fed from a constant current source, shown in Fig. 3.5, the equivalent
</p>
<p>schemes of the electrical circuit are shown in Fig. 3.7. For the reference direction of
</p>
<p>the induced electromotive force, it is possible to use e1 or e2, as indicated in Figs. 3.5
</p>
<p>and 3.7. If the reference direction e1 is chosen, the equivalent scheme (B) of Fig. 3.7
</p>
<p>applies, and algebraic intensity of the electromotive force is determined by (3.19).
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the equivalent scheme (A) and (3.21) apply. Quantity e2 &frac14; +dF/dt is
called back electromotive force or counter-electromotive force:

<p>Magnetic Circuit
</p>
<p>This chapter introduces and explains magnetic circuits of electrical machines. Basic
</p>
<p>laws and skills required to analyze magnetic circuits are reinstated and illustrated
</p>
<p>on examples and solved problems. The terms such as magnetic resistance, magneto-
</p>
<p>motive force, core flux, and winding flux are recalled and applied. Dual electrical
</p>
<p>circuit is introduced, explained, and applied in solving magnetic circuits. Basic
</p>
<p>properties of ferromagnetic materials are recalled, including saturation phenomena,
</p>
<p>eddy current losses, and hysteresis losses. Laminated magnetic circuits as the
</p>
<p>means of reducing the iron losses are explained and analyzed.
</p>
<p>One of the key operating principles of electromechanical converters based on
</p>
<p>magnetic field is creation of Lorentz force acting on a current-carrying conductor
</p>
<p>placed in the magnetic field. Magnetic field can be obtained from a permanent
</p>
<p>magnet or by using an electromagnet. Electromagnet is a system of windings
</p>
<p>carrying electrical currents that create magnetic field. It is useful in replacing the
</p>
<p>permanent magnets by coils carrying a relatively small electrical current. For
</p>
<p>the electromagnet currents to be moderate, it is necessary to employ magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits made of ferromagnetic material (iron), conducting the magnetic flux in a
</p>
<p>way similar to copper conductor directing electrical current. As the copper conduc-
</p>
<p>tor provides a low-resistance path to electrical current, so does the magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>provide a path to magnetic flux that has a low magnetic resistance. An example of
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit is shown in Fig. 4.1.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.1 shows a magnetic circuit made of iron, a ferromagnetic material with
</p>
<p>permeability m &frac14; B/H higher than that of the vacuum (m0) by several orders of
magnitude. This magnetic circuit has an air gap of size d. Within the gap, it is
</p>
<p>possible to place a conductor carrying current in order to obtain Lorentz force and
</p>
<p>accomplish electromechanical conversion of energy (the conductor is not shown in
</p>
<p>the figure). Magnetic flux within the magnetic circuit is created by means of the
</p>
<p>excitation winding with N series-connected contours, also called turns. Each turn
</p>
<p>encircles the magnetic circuit. Assuming that there are no losses and that the lines of

<p>the field are parallel, it is concluded that magnetic induction in iron (BFe) is equal to
</p>
<p>the magnetic induction in the air (B0). The strength of the magnetic field in iron is
</p>
<p>HFe &frac14; BFe/mFe, whereas in the air gap, it is equal toH0 &frac14; B0/m0. Since permeability
of iron is much higher, the magnetic field in iron will be considerably lower than the
</p>
<p>field in the air gap. Ampere law thus reduces to Ni &frac14; H0d, and the current required
for obtaining magnetic field H0 in the gap is equal to i &frac14; H0d/N.
</p>
<p>In order to obtain magnetic induction B in the air gap, it is necessary to establish
</p>
<p>the current i &frac14; Bd/(Nm0) in the excitation winding. Hence, the required excitation
current is proportional to the air gap d. An attempt to remove the iron part of the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit can be represented as an increase of the gap d to d + lFe, where lFe
is the length of the iron part of the magnetic circuit. The required current would
</p>
<p>increase 1 + lFe/d times. Since lFe &gt;&gt; d, removal of the iron would result in a
multiple increase of the excitation current and the associated losses. Therefore, it is
</p>
<p>concluded that the magnetic circuit is a key part of electrical machinery. It directs
</p>
<p>and concentrates the magnetic field to the region where the conductors move and
</p>
<p>the electromechanical conversion takes place. The presence of an iron magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit allows the necessary excitation to be accomplished with considerably
</p>
<p>smaller currents and lower losses.
</p>
<p>In the preceding section, an analysis of a simple magnetic circuit has been done.
</p>
<p>In the analysis, certain simplifications have been made. In order to analyze more
</p>
<p>complex magnetic circuits, a list of the basic laws and usual approximations to
</p>
<p>simplify the analysis is presented within the next section.

<p>4.1 Analysis of Magnetic Circuits
</p>
<p>Magnetic circuit is a domain where magnetic field is created by one or several
</p>
<p>current circuits or permanent magnets. The laws applicable for analysis of magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits are:
</p>
<p>&bull; The flux conservation law
</p>
<p>&bull; Generalized form of Ampere law
</p>
<p>&bull; Constitutive relation B(H) which describes a magnetic material
</p>
<p>4.1.1 Flux Conservation Law
</p>
<p>&thorn;
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>~B � d~S &frac14; 0: (4.1)
</p>
<p>Taking into account ferromagnetic properties of magnetic materials used in making
</p>
<p>magnetic circuits, a series of simplifications can be introduced in order to facilitate
</p>
<p>their analysis. One of the assumptions is that there is no leakage of magnetic lines
</p>
<p>outside magnetic circuit. Neglecting the leakage, it can be shown that the flux
</p>
<p>remains constant along the magnetic circuit. In other words, the magnetic flux in
</p>
<p>each cross-section of the magnetic circuit is the same. The flux in each cross-section
</p>
<p>is also called the core flux or the flux per turn, meaning the flux in a single turn of
</p>
<p>the winding encircling the magnetic circuit. The algebraic value of the flux in the
</p>
<p>cross-section is defined in accordance with the normal to the cross-section surface,
</p>
<p>and it is denoted by F. In most cases, magnetic circuit is encircled by a winding
</p>
<p>made of N series-connected turns having the orientation. Assuming that there is no
</p>
<p>flux leakage from the magnetic circuit, the flux in each turn is equal toF. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the flux of the winding isC &frac14; NF, with the same reference direction as for the flux
in one turn.
</p>
<p>The windings are connected in electrical circuits. The voltage across a winding
</p>
<p>is equal to u &frac14; Ri + dC/dt, where R is resistance of the series-connected turns, i is
winding current, while dC/dt is back electromotive force. It is of uttermost impor-
</p>
<p>tance to match the reference direction of the electrical circuit (current) with the
</p>
<p>orientation of the magnetic circuit (flux). As a rule, the reference normal for the flux
</p>
<p>is determined from the reference direction of the current by the right-hand rule.
</p>
<p>By applying the flux conservation law, it can be shown that the flux in one contour
</p>
<p>(turn) is equal to the flux through any other surface leaning on the same contour. This
</p>
<p>equality will be used to simplify calculation of the flux in the windings of cylindrical
</p>
<p>machines.
</p>
<p>Commonly used assumption is that the magnetic field is homogeneous over the
</p>
<p>cross-section of a magnetic circuit and that the length of any magnetic field line is
</p>
<p>equal to the length of the average representative line of the magnetic circuit.

<p>4.1.2 Generalized Form of Ampere Law
</p>
<p>Generalized form of Ampere law for fields with stationary electrical currents is
</p>
<p>given by (4.2). Contour c and surface S are shown in Fig. 4.2:

</p>
<p>Electrical currents in electrical machines are not distributed in space, but they
</p>
<p>exist in conductors forming the turns, windings, and current circuits. The conduc-
</p>
<p>tors are usually made of copper wires. With a layer of insulating material wrapped
</p>
<p>around wires, they do not have galvanic contact with other parts. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>current is directed along wires and does not leak away. Consequently, instead of a
</p>
<p>surface integral of current density J, one should use the sum of currents in the
</p>
<p>conductors passing through a surface S, respecting the reference direction deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the unit vector. Equation 4.2 thus takes the form (4.3):

</p>
<p>Field H and Induction B
</p>
<p>The relation between the vector of magnetic field H and magnetic induction B in
</p>
<p>individual parts of a magnetic circuit is determined by the properties of the
</p>
<p>magnetic material, and it is given by (4.4):

</p>
<p>In linear media, magnetic induction B is proportional to magnetic field H.
</p>
<p>Coefficient of proportionality is a scalar quantity m called magnetic permeability

<p>materials like iron, the characteristic B(H) is not linear. It is usually presented
</p>
<p>graphically or by the corresponding analytical approximation called the character-
</p>
<p>istic of magnetization. For small values of magnetic field, the magnetization
</p>
<p>characteristic of iron B(H) is linear and has the slope DB/DH which is several
</p>
<p>thousand times higher than the permeability of vacuum m0.

<p>4.2 The Flux Vector
</p>
<p>Flux through the contour of Fig. 4.2 is a scalar quantity. Flux through surface S,
</p>
<p>leaning on contour c, is determined by surface integral of the vector of magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B. In the analysis of electrical machines, flux through a contour is often
</p>
<p>considered as a vector. The flux vector is obtained by associating the course and
</p>
<p>direction with scalar F. The spatial orientation is obtained from the unit normal to
</p>
<p>surface S. In cases with several contours (turns) forming a winding where all of the
</p>
<p>contours share the same orientation, it is possible to define the flux vector of the
</p>
<p>winding. This flux has algebraic intensity ofC &frac14; NF while its course and direction
are determined by the unit normal to surface S. The winding can be made of series-
</p>
<p>connected contours (turns) with different spatial orientation. In such cases, the
</p>
<p>vector of the winding flux is obtained as a vector sum of flux vectors in individual
</p>
<p>contours.
</p>
<p>4.3 Magnetizing Characteristic of Ferromagnetic Materials
</p>
<p>Magnetic circuits of electrical machines and transformers are most frequently made
</p>
<p>of iron sheets. Iron is ferromagnetic material with magnetization characteristic B
</p>
<p>(H) shown in Fig. 4.3. The characteristic extends between the two straight lines.
</p>
<p>The line with the slope DB/DH &frac14; m0 describes magnetization characteristic of
vacuum, while the line with the slope mFe corresponds to the first derivative of
</p>
<p>the function B(H) at the origin. The abscissa of the B-H coordinate system is the
</p>
<p>external field H, which may be obtained by establishing a current in the excitation
</p>
<p>winding, while the ordinate is magnetic induction B existing in the ferromagnetic
</p>
<p>material.
</p>
<p>The magnetic properties of iron originate from microscopic Ampere currents
</p>
<p>within a molecule or a group of molecules. These currents make the origin of the
</p>
<p>magnetic field of permanent magnets and other ferromagnetic materials. The said
</p>
<p>currents are the cause of forces acting on ferromagnetic parts brought in a magnetic
</p>
<p>field. The presence of microscopic currents can be taken into account by treating
</p>
<p>4.3 Magnetizing Characteristic of Ferromagnetic Materials 63</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ferromagnetic materials as a vast collection of miniature magnetic dipoles, as
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 4.3. In the absence of external field H, the magnetic dipoles do not
</p>
<p>have the same orientation. They oscillate and change directions at a speed that
</p>
<p>depends on the temperature of the material. Therefore, in the absence of an external
</p>
<p>magnetic field, resulting magnetic induction in the material is equal to zero.
</p>
<p>With an excitation current giving rise to magnetic field H, magnetic dipoles turn
</p>
<p>in an attempt to get aligned with the field. Thermal motion of dipoles prevents them
</p>
<p>to stay aligned and makes them change the orientation. The higher the field H, the
</p>
<p>more dipoles get aligned to the field. As a consequence, resulting magnetic induc-
</p>
<p>tion takes the value B &frac14; mFeH which is much higher than the corresponding value
in vacuum (B &frac14; m0H). In this way, ferromagnetic materials help providing the
required magnetic induction B with much smaller excitation current.
</p>
<p>When magnetic induction reaches Bmax &isin; [1. . .2] T, all miniature dipoles get
</p>
<p>oriented in the same direction, aligned with the excitation field H. Any further
</p>
<p>increase of the field strength H cannot improve the orientation of dipoles, as there
</p>
<p>are no more disoriented dipoles. This state is called saturation of magnetic material.
</p>
<p>In the region of saturation, further increase of induction is the same as it would have
</p>
<p>been in vacuum, DB &frac14; m0DH. The saturation region is expressed in the right-hand
side of the curve in Fig. 4.3.

<p>4.4 Magnetic Resistance of the Circuit
</p>
<p>The role of magnetic circuit in electrical machines is to direct the lines of magnetic
</p>
<p>coupling field to the space where the electromagnetic conversion takes place. The
</p>
<p>magnetic induction and flux F in the magnetic circuit appear under the influence of
</p>
<p>current in the winding. The strength of the field H is dependent on the product Ni,
</p>
<p>where N is the number of turns in a winding while i is the electrical current. In a
</p>
<p>way, the value Ni tends to establish the fluxF in the magnetic circuit. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>ratio Ni/F is magnetic resistance of the circuit. A circuit having smaller magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance will reach the given flux with smaller currents. A magnetic circuit can
</p>
<p>have several parts, which can be made of ferromagnetic material, permanent
</p>
<p>magnets, nonmagnetic materials, or air. Air-filled parts of magnetic circuits are
</p>
<p>also called air gaps. It is of interest to determine magnetic resistance of a magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit comprising several heterogeneous parts.
</p>
<p>Magnetizing characteristics of ferromagnetic parts of magnetic circuit are non-
</p>
<p>linear and shown in Fig. 4.3. Operation of a magnetic circuit is usually performed in
</p>
<p>the vicinity of the origin of B(H) diagram. It is therefore justifiable to linearize the
</p>
<p>magnetization characteristics and consider that the permeability mFe of ferromag-
</p>
<p>netic (iron) parts is constant. In the linearized ferromagnetic circuits, nonlinearity of
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic material is neglected, and permeability of every part of the magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit is considered constant. In addition, it is assumed that there is no leakage of
</p>
<p>magnetic field outside magnetic circuit. The basic assumptions and steps in the
</p>
<p>analysis of linearized magnetic circuits are given by the following considerations.
</p>
<p>On the basis of (4.3), the line integral of magnetic field H along contour c,
</p>
<p>indicated in Fig. 4.4, is equal to the product Ni. Magnetomotive force F &frac14; Ni is
equal to the integral of the fieldH through the closed contour passing through all the
</p>
<p>parts of the magnetic circuit. Magnetomotive force F is a scalar quantity. Vector of
</p>
<p>the magnetomotive force is obtained by associating the spatial orientation to the
</p>
<p>scalar F &frac14; Ni. The orientation of the magnetomotive force F is determined by
the vector H. Both the orientations of F and H are related to electrical currents in
</p>
<p>the winding that encircles the magnetic circuit. In Fig. 4.4, vector of the magneto-
</p>
<p>motive force F is collinear with the normal nk related to the reference direction of
</p>
<p>the electric currents by the right-hand rule.
</p>
<p>Surface integral of magnetic induction over surface S is denoted by F and is
</p>
<p>called flux of the core or flux across the cross-section of the magnetic circuit or flux in
</p>
<p>one turn. Assuming that there is no leakage of magnetic field outside of the magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit, the line integral of the magnetic field H along contour c is equal Ni for every
</p>
<p>and each contour passing through the magnetic circuit. Since the basic assumption is
</p>
<p>that the lengths ofmagnetic lines are equal to the length of the representative average
</p>
<p>line of the magnetic circuit, it can be considered that the magnetic field is homoge-
</p>
<p>neous across each cross-section of the magnetic circuit. Thus, the flux through one
</p>
<p>turn is F &frac14; BS.Winding fluxC &frac14; NF represents the flux through the winding with
N series-connected turns.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A dual electrical circuit can be associated with the magnetic circuit, as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.5. In this circuit, electromotive force E causes the current i &frac14; E/R in resistance
R. Electromotive force E is equal to the integral of the external electrical field in the
</p>
<p>electrical generator. In magnetic circuit, magnetomotive force F produces the
</p>
<p>flux F &frac14; F/Rm. The flux F in magnetic circuit of magnetic resistance Rm is dual to
the electrical current i &frac14; E/R in electrical circuit of resistance R. For this reason, the
electrical circuit is an equivalent representation of the magnetic circuit and is
</p>
<p>therefore called dual circuit. A more detailed analysis can show that Kirchhoff
</p>
<p>laws can be applied to complex magnetic circuits in the same way they apply to
</p>
<p>electrical circuits.
</p>
<p>Magnetomotive force F can be considered as magnetic voltage of the considered
</p>
<p>contour c. By analogy with electrical circuit with i &frac14; E/R, the flux in magnetic
circuit is F &frac14; F/Rm, where Rm is resistance of the magnetic circuit or reluctance.
Therefore, the flux in a magnetic circuit is obtained by dividing the magnetomotive
</p>
<p>force Ni by the magnetic resistance Rm. This applies for linear magnetic circuits
</p>
<p>with constant permeability m, with no magnetic leakage, and with constant core flux
</p>
<p>along the whole magnetic circuit. The last condition stems from the law of conser-
</p>
<p>vation of magnetic flux. Quantities F, F, and Rm of a magnetic circuit are duals to
</p>
<p>quantities i, U, and R of the equivalent electrical circuit. Equation 4.8 represents
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohm law&rdquo; for magnetic circuit or Hopkins law.
</p>
<p>Magnetic resistance of a uniform magnetic circuit of length l, constant cross-
</p>
<p>section S, and permeability m is equal to Rm &frac14; l/(Sm). Magnetic circuit may consist
of several segments of different dimensions and different magnetic properties. The
</p>
<p>segments of magnetic circuits are usually connected in series. The equivalent
</p>
<p>magnetic resistance of the magnetic circuit can be obtained by adding the individual
</p>
<p>resistances of series-connected segments. For a magnetic circuit with n segments,
</p>
<p>the equivalent magnetic resistance can be determined by adding resistances Rmk &frac14;
lk/(Skmk), as shown in (4.9):

<p>The expression (4.9) assumes that the permeability m does not change within the
</p>
<p>same segment, that all the segments have the same flux per cross-section, and that
</p>
<p>the lengths of magnetic lines within each segment are equal to the average length of
</p>
<p>the segment. In cases when the cross-section S and permeability m vary continually
</p>
<p>along magnetic circuit, magnetic resistance is determined by (4.10), where c is
</p>
<p>oriented representative average line of the magnetic circuit. The cross-section S(x)
</p>
<p>and permeability m(x) are functions of variable x, which represents the path of
</p>
<p>circulation along the contour c, that is, the path along the average line of the circuit.
</p>
<p>Considering a tiny slice of the magnetic circuit having the length Dx, the cross-
</p>
<p>section S(x), and permeability m(x), it is reasonable to assume that S(x) � S(x + Dx)
and m(x) � m(x + Dx). Therefore, magnetic resistance DRm of the considered part
of magnetic circuit is equal to Dx/(Sm). The equivalent resistance of the magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit is obtained by adding resistances of all such parts of the magnetic circuit,
</p>
<p>resulting into integral (4.10). Equation 4.10 is in accordance with the formula for
</p>

<p>4.5 Energy in a Magnetic Circuit
</p>
<p>Energy of magnetic field is determined by integration of the spatial energy density

</p>
<p>in air, spatial density of magnetic energy is BH/2. In the case of a magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>with no leakage, magnetic field is present only within the circuit. Therefore, the

<p>Magnetic circuit can be divided into elementary volumes dV &frac14; Sdl, where S is
the cross-section of the magnetic circuit and dl is the length of the elementary
</p>
<p>volume, measured along the representative average line of the magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>(contour c). According to the flux conservation law, the flux is the same through any
</p>
<p>cross-section of the magnetic circuit. Therefore, the surface integral of magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B is equal to F on any cross-section of the circuit. The usual and well-
</p>
<p>founded assumption is that the magnetic field is homogeneous at every cross-
</p>
<p>section, namely, that the magnetic induction B across the cross-section does not
</p>
<p>change. Therefore, it can be concluded that magnetic induction B on each cross-
</p>
<p>section S isF/S. With dV &frac14; Sdl, the integral (4.12) can be simplified by substituting
wmdV by &frac12;FHdl. The vector H is collinear with the oriented element of contour dl.

<p>4.6 Reference Direction of the Magnetic Circuit
</p>
<p>Magnetic circuit can have more than one winding around the core. Figure 4.6 shows
</p>
<p>a magnetic circuit having two windings, N1 and N2. Winding flux arises in each of
</p>
<p>the windings. The two windings are coupled by the magnetic circuit. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>flux in each winding depends on both currents, i1 and i2. Reference direction of
</p>
<p>the winding flux is related by the right-hand rule to the reference direction of the
</p>
<p>4.6 Reference Direction of the Magnetic Circuit 69</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>current of the considered winding. Reference direction of fluxC1 is denoted by unit
</p>
<p>vector n1 in Fig. 4.5. This direction is in accordance with the adopted direction of
</p>
<p>circulation around contour c. The unit vector denoting this direction is the normal n.
</p>
<p>The adopted direction is called reference direction of the magnetic circuit. The flux
</p>
<p>intensity is determined by the product of the core flux and number of turns, thus
</p>
<p>C1 &frac14; N1F. The reference direction of the flux C2 in the other winding is denoted
by unit vector n2, and it is opposite to the adopted direction. Since the flux of the
</p>
<p>core F is defined as the flux though cross-section S in the direction of unit vector n,
</p>
<p>the flux in the second winding is negative, C2 &frac14; �N2F. Choice of the reference
direction of magnetic circuit can be arbitrary; therefore, in the analysis of circuits
</p>
<p>having several windings, each winding should be allocated reference direction
</p>
<p>according to the right-hand rule and compared with the reference direction of the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit.
</p>
<p>RelationsC1 &frac14; N1F andC2 &frac14; �N2F have been obtained under the assumption
that there is no leakage of magnetic field, that is, that the flux over cross-section is
</p>
<p>maintained constant. In the absence of leakage, flux in the turns of winding N1 is
</p>
<p>equal to the flux in the turns of winding N2; therefore, the ratio C1/C2 is equal to
</p>
<p>N1/N2, the ratio of the number of turns. The same holds for the ratio e1/e2 between
</p>
<p>the electromotive forces induced in the windings. In real magnetic circuits, a certain
</p>
<p>amount of flux is leaking away from the magnetic circuit. A small portion of flux in
</p>
<p>winding N1 can escape the core before arriving at winding N2. This flux is called
</p>
<p>stray or leakage flux of the first winding. In the same manner, the leakage flux of the
</p>

</p>
<p>70 4 Magnetic Circuit</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>second winding encircles the winding N2, but it leaks away from the core before
</p>
<p>reaching the winding N1. In the case when the leakage flux cannot be neglected,
</p>
<p>ratio│C1/C2│ deflects from N1/N2. Strength of magnetic coupling between two
windings is described by the coefficient of inductive coupling k � 1. In the absence
of leakage, the coupling coefficient is equal to 1. With k &frac14; 0.9, the relative amount
of leakage flux is 10%.
</p>
<p>4.7 Losses in Magnetic Circuits
</p>
<p>The energy accumulated in the field of electromechanical converters exhibits a cyclic
</p>
<p>change. Therefore, magnetic induction in magnetic circuits varies within conversion
</p>
<p>cycles. In AC current machines and transformers, magnetic induction has a sinusoidal
</p>
<p>variation. Variations of induction B in ferromagnetic materials cause energy losses.
</p>
<p>These can be divided into eddy current losses and hysteresis losses. Power of losses per
</p>
<p>unit mass is also called specific power or loss power density.
</p>
<p>4.7.1 Hysteresis Losses
</p>
<p>Variation of magnetic field in a ferromagnetic material implies setting in motion
</p>
<p>magnetic dipoles and changing their orientation. Rotation of magnetic dipoles
</p>
<p>requires a certain amount of energy. This energy can be estimated from the surface
</p>
<p>of hysteresis curve of the B &frac14; f(H) diagram. When induction B oscillates with a
cycle time (period) T, as shown in Fig. 4.7, the operating point in the B &frac14; f(t)
diagram runs along the trajectory called hysteresis curve. The energy consumed by
</p>
<p>rotation of dipoles within one cycle T is proportional to the surface encircled by the
</p>
<p>hysteresis curve swept by the (B-H) operating point. The origin of hysteresis losses
</p>

the magnetization characteristic exhibiting hysteresis (right)
</p>
<p>4.7 Losses in Magnetic Circuits 71</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is friction between neighboring magnetic dipoles in the course of their cyclic
</p>
<p>rotation. This internal friction causes consumption of energy which is converted
</p>
<p>into heat.
</p>
<p>Specific power losses due to hysteresis pH are proportional to operating
</p>
<p>frequency and to surface encircled by the hysteresis curve in the B-H plane. The
</p>
<p>energy lost in each operating cycle due to hysteresis in ferromagnetic material of
</p>
<p>volume V is
</p>
<p>WH &frac14; V
&thorn;
</p>
<p>H dB &frac14; V � SH; (4.15)
</p>
<p>where SH is surface encircled by hysteresis curve. With the operating frequency f,
</p>
<p>power loss due to hysteresis is
</p>
<p>PH &frac14; f V � SH: (4.16)

&frac14; f SH: (4.17)
</p>
<p>Surface of the hysteresis curve SH depends on the shape of the curve and peak
</p>
<p>values of the magnetic field Hm and induction Bm. The surface is proportional to the
</p>
<p>product BmHm. The peak values Hm and Bm are in mutual proportion. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the surface SH is also proportional to Bm
2. Therefore, the losses per unit volume can
</p>
<p>be expressed as
</p>
<p>pH1 &frac14; sH1 � f � B2m: (4.18)
</p>
<p>By introducing coefficient sH which is equal to the ratio of the coefficient sH1
and specific mass of ferromagnetic material, specific losses due to hysteresis per
</p>
<p>unit mass are
</p>
<p>pH &frac14; sH � f � B2m: (4.19)
</p>
<p>4.7.2 Losses Due to Eddy Currents
</p>
<p>Ferromagnetic materials are usually conductive. In parts of magnetic circuit that
</p>
<p>are made of conductive ferromagnetic, it is possible to envisage toroidal tubes
</p>
<p>of conductive material and to consider each of them a closed contour capable of
</p>
<p>carrying electrical currents. Variation of magnetic induction B changes the flux in
</p>
<p>such contours. As a consequence, electromotive forces are induced in such contours,
</p>
<p>72 4 Magnetic Circuit</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and they produce electrical currents that oppose to the flux changes. A number
</p>
<p>of conductive contours can be identified within each piece of ferromagnetic. There-
</p>
<p>fore, the change in magnetic induction causes spatially distributed currents which
</p>
<p>contribute to losses in magnetic circuits. Such currents are also called eddy currents.
</p>
<p>The losses associated to such currents are called eddy current losses.
</p>
<p>Figure 4.8 shows a piece of ferromagnetic material with oscillatory induction B
</p>
<p>of amplitude Bm and angular frequency o. Lines of magnetic induction are
</p>
<p>encircled by contour C which is at the same time the average line of the tube
</p>
<p>having cross-section SC and length lC. Since the tube is in a ferromagnetic material
</p>
<p>of finite conductivity s, it can be represented by a conductive contour with
</p>
<p>equivalent resistance RC &frac14; lC/(SCs). Changes in inductance B result in flux
changes. In turn, flux changes give rise to induced electromotive force in the

</p>
<p>Therefore, total losses in magnetic circuit due to eddy currents are proportional
</p>
<p>to the squared angular frequency and squared magnetic induction. Specific losses
</p>
<p>due to eddy currents are
</p>
<p>pV &frac14; sV � f 2 � Bm2; (4.22)
</p>
<p>where sV is coefficient of proportionality, dependent on the specific conductivity
</p>
<p>and specific mass of the material.
</p>
<p>Question (4.2): The cross-section of magnetic circuit is shown in Fig. 4.8.
Dimensions of these cross-sections are L � L &frac14; S. Magnetic induction B is equal
in all points of this cross-section and perpendicular to the surface S. Make an
</p>
<p>approximate comparison of eddy current losses at the point which is displaced
</p>
<p>from the center by L/2 and at the point which is displaced from the center by L/4.
</p>
<p>Answer (4.2): Eddy current can be estimated by considering two contours, the
larger one of radius L/2 and the smaller one with radius L/4. Specific eddy current
</p>
<p>losses, that is, the losses per unit volume, depend on the square of the induced
</p>
<p>electrical field Ei, pV ~ sEi
2. Induced electrical field can be estimated by dividing
</p>
<p>the induced electromotive force E of the contour by the length of the contour. The
</p>
<p>contour of radius L/2 has four times larger surface and, therefore, four times larger
</p>
<p>flux and electromotive force E. Its length is two times larger than the length of the
</p>
<p>small contour. Therefore, induced electrical field Ei along the larger contour has
</p>
<p>twice the strength of the induced electrical field along the small contour. Finally, the
</p>
<p>eddy current losses at the point further away from the center are four times larger.
</p>
<p>4.7.3 Total Losses in Magnetic Circuit
</p>
<p>The sum of specific losses due to hysteresis and due to eddy currents is given by
</p>
<p>(4.23). Specific losses pFe are expressed in W/kg units. With uniform flux density B,
</p>
<p>the loss distribution in magnetic circuit is uniform as well. In this case, total
</p>
<p>magnetic field losses in a magnetic circuit of mass m are PFe &frac14; pFem.

<p>determined by integrating specific losses over the volume of the magnetic circuit.
</p>
<p>4.7.4 The Methods of Reduction of Iron Losses
</p>
<p>Power losses in magnetic circuits of electromechanical converters reduce their
</p>
<p>efficiency. In addition, the losses are eventually turned to heat, and they increase
</p>
<p>temperature of the magnetic circuit. Overheating can result in damage to the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit or to other nearby parts of the machine. Therefore, it is necessary
</p>
<p>to transfer this heat to the environment. In other words, it is necessary to provide the
</p>
<p>means for proper cooling. Loss reduction simplifies the cooling system, increases
</p>
<p>conversion efficiency, and reduces the amount of heat passed to the environment.
</p>
<p>In iron sheets and other ferromagnetic materials used for making magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits of electrical machines and transformers, iron losses due to eddy currents
</p>
<p>prevail over iron losses due to hysteresis. Eddy current losses are larger than
</p>
<p>hysteresis losses by an order of magnitude. The losses can be reduced by taking
</p>
<p>additional measures in designing and manufacturing magnetic circuits, thus
</p>
<p>increasing the efficiency of electrical machines and preventing their overheating.
</p>
<p>By adding silicon and other materials of low specific conductivity into iron used
</p>
<p>for making magnetic circuits, specific conductivity of such an alloy is reduced. The
</p>
<p>increase of resistance RC of the eddy current contours reduces the amplitude of such
</p>
<p>currents (4.21) and reduces eddy current losses.
</p>
<p>Another approach to reducing eddy current losses is lamination, the process of
</p>
<p>assembling magnetic circuits out of sheets of ferromagnetic material. The sheets
</p>
<p>are oriented along direction of the magnetic field, in the way shown in Fig. 4.9.
</p>
<p>A laminar magnetic circuit is not made of solid iron, but of iron sheets which are
</p>
<p>electrically isolated from one another.
</p>
<p>Since the sheets are parallel with magnetic field, contours of induced eddy
</p>
<p>currents are perpendicular to the field. Electrical insulation between neighboring
</p>
<p>layers prevents eddy currents; thus, they can be formed only within individual
</p>
<p>layers. It can be shown that this contributes to a considerable reduction of eddy
</p>
<p>current losses.
</p>
<p>Iron sheets used for designing magnetic circuits of line-frequency transformers
</p>
<p>(50 or 60 Hz) and conventional electrical machines are 0.2&ndash;0.5 mm thick. Insula-
</p>
<p>tion between the sheets is made by inserting thin layers of insulating material
</p>
<p>(paper, lacquer) or by short-time exposure of iron sheets to an acid which forms a
</p>
<p>thin layer of nonconductive iron compound (salt).
</p>
<p>In contemporary electrical machines used in electrical vehicles, hybrid cars, and
</p>
<p>alternative power sources, the operating frequency may be in excess of 1 kHz.
</p>
<p>Magnetic circuits of such machines are made of very thin iron sheets (0.05&ndash;0.1 mm)
</p>
<p>or of amorphous strips based on alloys of iron, manganese, and other metals, as well
</p>

<p>as of ferrites. Ferrite is material obtained from molten iron alloy exposed to an
</p>
<p>increased pressure and fed to a nozzle with a very small orifice. Expanding at the
</p>
<p>mouth of the nozzle, the molten alloy is dispersed into small balls with diameter
</p>
<p>next to 50 mm. Short oxidation of these balls creates a thin layer of insulating oxide.
</p>
<p>Consequently, miniature balls fall into a cooling oil. By collecting them, one
</p>
<p>obtains a fine dust made of insulated ferromagnetic balls. Put under pressure
</p>
<p>(sintering), this dust becomes a hard and fragile material called ferrite. Magnetic
</p>
<p>properties of ferrites are similar to those of iron. At the same time, due to a virtual
</p>
<p>absence of eddy currents, the losses in ferrites are very low.
</p>
<p>4.7.5 Eddy Currents in Laminated Ferromagnetics
</p>
<p>Figure 4.10 shows one sheet of iron from the package which is used in making

<p>magnetic circuit. Thickness of the sheet is a. Magnetic induction B is directed along
</p>
<p>the sheet, and it changes in accordance with B(t) &frac14; Bmsinot, where Bm is amplitude
and o is angular frequency. Thickness a is very small compared to the height l of
</p>
<p>the sheet. Within the cross-section of the sheet, a contour C can be identified
</p>
<p>of width 2x. Since x � a/2, one can assume that x &lt;&lt; l. In Fig. 4.10, reference

<p>induction; thus, flux through the contour is
</p>
<p>F &frac14; �2 � x � l � Bm � sinot:
</p>
<p>The electromotive force in the contour is determined by the first derivative of the
</p>

</p>
<p>calculating the eddy current losses, the choice of reference direction does not
</p>
<p>influence the result of the calculation. The losses depend on the square of eddy
</p>
<p>currents, which in turn depend on e2. Since x &lt;&lt; l, the part of the contour integral
along short sides of the contour C can be neglected. Therefore, the induced

</p>
<p>Figure 4.9a shows a homogenous piece of ferromagnetic material which could
</p>
<p>be considered as one layer of thickness a &frac14; A. Starting from the assumption that
thickness of the considered part is considerably smaller than the height, it is

</p>
<p>The considered part of magnetic circuit can be made to consist of N mutually

electrical insulation between the ferromagnetic sheets is considerably smaller than
</p>
<p>a, it can be assumed that the cross-section of laminated magnetic circuit is filled
</p>
<p>with iron. Therefore, magnetic resistance of laminated magnetic circuit is equal to
</p>
<p>the resistance of magnetic circuit of the same shape, made of homogenous piece of
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic material, as shown in Fig. 4.9a. Equation 4.25 gives the eddy current
</p>
<p>losses P1Fe in one sheet (layer), whatever the size. It has been applied (4.26) to
</p>
<p>homogeneous magnetic circuit in Fig. 4.9a, which is considered as a single sheet

</p>
<p>Result (4.27) indicates that losses due to eddy currents in a part of magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit of given dimensions decrease N2 times if the ferromagnetic material is split
</p>
<p>into N insulated layers (sheets) of equal thickness oriented along the direction of
</p>
<p>magnetic field. In cases with variable magnetic field perpendicular to the iron
</p>
<p>sheets, the lamination does not reduce the eddy current losses. In addition, lamina-
</p>
<p>tion of a magnetic circuit does not reduce the losses due to hysteresis.
</p>
<p>In the case of a well-positioned laminar structure of magnetic circuit, losses due
</p>
<p>to eddy currents are proportional to the squared laminar thickness a, which leads to
</p>
<p>the conclusion that one should be using iron sheets as thin as possible. Conse-
</p>
<p>quently, the question arises, why not use the iron sheets thinner than 0.1 � 0.2 mm?
Thinner sheets are more difficult to cut and to assemble. At the same time, a
</p>
<p>decrease in thickness would reduce the equivalent cross-section of iron, decrease
</p>
<p>the peak flux, and increase the magnetic resistance. Namely, there is an insulating
</p>
<p>layer between the sheets, made of paper or nonconductive iron compounds. It is
</p>
<p>several tens of micrometers thick, and it exists on both sides of the sheets. Any
</p>
<p>further reduction of sheet thickness would reduce the amount of iron in the cross-
</p>
<p>section of magnetic circuit below reason.
</p>
<p>In magnetic circuits made of solid material where eddy currents are considerable,
</p>
<p>magnetic field does not have homogeneous distribution over the cross-section.
</p>
<p>An increase in operating frequency leads to significant eddy currents which, in
</p>
<p>turn, result in uneven distribution of magnetic induction B across the cross-section
</p>
<p>of the core. Namely, eddy currents create magnetic field which opposes to variations
</p>
<p>ofmagnetic induction in the core. Such an effect of eddy currents is more emphasized
</p>
<p>in the middle of the core, the region which is encircled by all the eddy current
</p>
<p>contours (see Fig. 4.9a). This phenomenon results in difference between magnetic
</p>
<p>induction in the center of the core and the induction at the peripheral regions.
</p>
<p>In magnetic circuits made of iron sheets, these effects are reduced considerably,
</p>
<p>and there is no significant difference in the field intensity across the cross-section of
</p>
<p>the core.

</p>
<p>Rotating Electrical Machines
</p>
<p>This chapter provides basic information on cylindrical machine. Typical machine
</p>
<p>windings are introduced and explained, along with the basic forms of magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits with slots and teeth. This chapter introduces common notation, symbols,
</p>
<p>and conventions in representing the windings, their magnetic exes, their flux, and
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force. Typical losses and power balance charts are explained
</p>
<p>and presented for cylindrical motors and generators. Calculation of the magnetic
</p>
<p>field energy in the air gap of cylindrical machines is given at the end of this chapter,
</p>
<p>along with considerations regarding the torque per volume ratio.
</p>
<p>Electrical machines are usually rotating devices creating electromagnetic torque
</p>
<p>due to the magnetic coupling field. The machines perform electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversion of energy; thus, they are called rotational converters. The stationary
</p>
<p>part of rotating machines is called stator. The mobile part which rotates is called
</p>
<p>rotor. The rotating movement of the rotor is accessible via shaft, which serves for
</p>
<p>rotor mechanical coupling to a work machine. The magnetic coupling field creates
</p>
<p>torque which acts on the rotor forcing it to rotation. The torque is the result of
</p>
<p>interaction of electromagnetic forces, and for this reason, it is called electromag-
</p>
<p>netic torque.
</p>
<p>5.1 Magnetic Circuit of Rotating Machines
</p>
<p>Electrical machines are mainly of cylindrical shape. Stationary part of the machine
</p>
<p>(stator) is mostly made in the form of a hollow cylinder which accommodates
</p>
<p>cylindrical rotor capable of rotating in its bearings with negligible friction. Both
</p>
<p>stator and rotor aremade of ferromagneticmaterial, and between them, there is an air
</p>
<p>gap. Along the rotor axis, there is a shaft which serves for transferring the electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic torque to a mechanical subsystem. The shaft protrudes out of the machine
</p>
<p>to facilitate the coupling to work machines. Both stator and rotor contain windings
</p>
<p>and/or permanent magnets which create the stator and rotor fields. By interaction of

<p>these fields, the electromagnetic torque is created, and it acts on the rotor and creates
</p>
<p>rotational movement. Figure 5.1 shows cross-section of the magnetic circuit of an
</p>
<p>electrical machine.
</p>
<p>5.2 Mechanical Access
</p>
<p>Rotating machines are connected via shaft to a load or a work machine. The rotor
</p>
<p>and shaft are rotating at the mechanical angular speed Om. The torque Tem is created
</p>
<p>by a couple of electromagnetic forces Fem which tend to move the rotor. The
</p>
<p>product of the torque Tem and speed of rotation Om gives the power of electromag-
</p>
<p>netic conversion Pem &frac14; TemOm. In cases when the torque acts in the direction of
rotation, power Pem is positive. Then, electrical energy is being converted to
</p>
<p>mechanical work; thus, the machine operates in the motor mode. Reference
</p>
<p>directions for the torque and speed are indicated in Fig. 5.2.
</p>
<p>The shaft represents mechanical connection, that is, mechanical access or
</p>
<p>mechanical output of the machine. It rotates at angular speed Om and does the
</p>
<p>transfer of electromagnetic torque Tem. In the case when the machine operates as a
</p>
<p>motor, the electromagnetic torque excites movement (Tem &gt; 0), while mechanical
load (load or work machine) resists to motion by an opposing torque, a torque of the
</p>
<p>opposite sign, denoted by Tm. In this operating mode, electromagnetic torque
</p>
<p>Tem &gt; 0 tends to accelerate the rotor, while the opposing torque Tm &gt; 0 tends to

</p>
<p>In general, electrical machine can be operated as a motor or as a generator.
</p>
<p>A motor performs electromechanical conversion of electrical energy to mechanical
</p>
<p>work; a generator performs conversion in the reverse direction. For a machine
</p>
<p>operating in motor mode, torque Tem is of positive sign, whereas in generator mode,
</p>
<p>the sign of the torque Tem is negative. Electrical generators have their rotor
</p>
<p>connected to a turbine which turns the rotor, supplying the mechanical power into
</p>
<p>the machine. Thus, the torque Tm assumes a negative value with respect to the
</p>
<p>reference direction shown in Fig. 5.2. Electromagnetic torque of the generator Tem
opposes this movement, and it also takes a negative value with respect to the
</p>
<p>reference direction. Considering adopted reference directions, power of electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic conversion Pem is negative, indicating that the machine converts mechan-
</p>
<p>ical work into electrical energy.
</p>
<p>5.3 The Windings
</p>
<p>In addition to magnetic circuits, which direct the magnetic field, electrical machines
</p>
<p>also have current circuits, also called windings, which conduct electrical current.
</p>
<p>The windings are made of a number of series connected, insulated copper
</p>
<p>conductors. In cylindrical machines, the conductors are positioned along the cylin-
</p>
<p>der axis (coaxially). By connecting a number of conductors in series, one obtains a
</p>
<p>winding. Two conductors connected in series and positioned diametrically consti-
</p>
<p>tute one contour or one turn. A machine could have a number of windings. They
</p>
<p>may be placed on both stator and rotor. Each winding has two terminals, which
</p>
<p>could be short circuited, open, or connected to a power source feeding the machine.
</p>
<p>By connecting them to a voltage or current source, electrical current is established
</p>
<p>in the windings. Terminals of the windings are electrical access (connection, input)
</p>
<p>of the machine. Current i in a winding having N turns creates magnetomotive force
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>of F &frac14; Ni. By dividing the magnetomotive force with magnetic resistance Rm, one
obtains flux F. Stator windings create stator flux, whereas rotor windings create
</p>
<p>rotor flux. There are machines where stator or rotor does not have windings, but
</p>
<p>the flux is created by permanent magnets.
</p>
<p>The resultant flux of themachine is obtained by joint action of themagnetomotive
</p>
<p>forces of the stator and rotor. Lines of the resulting field run through the magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit of rotor, air gap, and magnetic circuit of stator. Figure 5.3(A) shows the
</p>
<p>lines of magnetic field in the air gap. The figure shows the zone wheremagnetic lines

</p>
<p>1 Figure 5.3 shows an approximate shape of the lines of magnetic field in the air gap, which does
</p>
<p>not correspond to the air gap field of real machines. Electrical machines have magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>containing slots and teeth which are described in the following subsections. The presence of slots
</p>
<p>has an influence on the shape of the air gap field, making it relatively more complicated. In the
</p>
<p>hypothetical case when the magnetic circuit is of an ideal cylindrical shape and permeability of
</p>
<p>the ferromagnetic material is considerably higher than that of the air, the lines of magnetic field are
</p>
<p>perpendicular to the surface separating the air gap and the ferromagnetic material. It is of interest
</p>
<p>to envisage the surface that separates the air gap from the ferromagnetic material. The boundary
</p>
<p>conditions relate tangential components of magnetic field H on either side of this surface with
</p>
<p>surface electrical currents JS. With JS &frac14; 0, tangential component of magnetic field H in the air is
equal to tangential component of magnetic field in ferromagnetic material. Since BFe &lt; 1.7 T and
HFe &frac14; BFe/mFe � 0, tangential component of magnetic field in the air is close to zero. Thus, the
lines of magnetic field in the air gap are perpendicular to the surface separating the air gap and
</p>
<p>the ferromagnetic circuit.

<p>magnetic pole of the rotor. Diametrically opposed is the south magnetic pole.
</p>
<p>In the same way, the north and south poles of the stator can be identified. The
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque arises from the tendency of rotor poles to take place against
</p>
<p>the opposite poles of the stator.
</p>
<p>The right-hand side of Fig. 5.3 shows cross-section of the machine. Conductors
</p>
<p>of stator and rotor windings are marked by (C). The stator and rotor could have
</p>
<p>several windings. For clarity, individual windings are represented by the symbol
</p>
<p>marked by (E) in Fig. 5.3.
</p>
<p>Stator flux can be represented by a vector whose course and direction are
</p>
<p>determined by positions of its poles, while its algebraic intensity (amplitude) is
</p>
<p>determined by the flux itself, namely, by the surface integral of magnetic induction
</p>
<p>B. Rotor flux can be represented in the same way. In the following subsections, it
</p>
<p>will be shown that the electromagnetic torque is determined by the vector product
</p>
<p>of the two fluxes, that is, by the product of the flux amplitudes and the sine of the
</p>
<p>angle between them.
</p>
<p>5.4 Slots in Magnetic Circuit
</p>
<p>Magnetic circuits of the stator and rotor are made of iron sheets in order to reduce
</p>
<p>power losses. The iron sheets are laid coaxially. Each individual sheet has a cross-
</p>
<p>section of the form indicated in Fig. 5.4. A number of sheets are assembled and
</p>
<p>fastened, producing is such way magnetic core. Stator usually assumes the form of a
</p>
<p>hollow cylinder, whereas rotor is cylindrical, fitting in the stator cavity. Distance
</p>
<p>between the stator and rotor (air gap) can be from one to several millimeters.
</p>
<p>Windings of the machine consist of series connected, mutually insulated copper
</p>
<p>conductors. Conductors are insulated between each other, as well as from the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit and other parts of the machine. The conductors are insulated

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>by lacquer, paper, silicon rubber, or some other insulating material. The insulated
</p>
<p>copper conductors are placed in slots which are positioned coaxially (parallel to
</p>
<p>machine axis) along the inner side of the stator magnetic circuit or outer side of the
</p>
<p>rotor magnetic circuit. Examples of some of the slots are shown in Fig. 5.5. Shape of
</p>
<p>the cross-section of a slot is determined by the need for achieving a smaller or larger
</p>
<p>leakage flux as well as by the need for mechanical tightening of the conductors
</p>
<p>placed in these slots. The slots shown in Fig. 5.5 may have one or more conductors.
</p>
<p>In most cases, the stator slots may have conductors of two different phase windings.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 5.6, the cross-section of the stator magnetic circuit shows the axial
</p>
<p>grooves along the inner surface of the stator. These grooves are called slots. Part
</p>
<p>of the magnetic circuit between two neighboring slots is called tooth. The teeth are
</p>
<p>formed by cutting the same slot through all the iron sheets which are assembled
</p>
<p>when forming the magnetic circuit. After the sheets are arranged, one obtains a slot
</p>
<p>of trapezoidal, or oval, or of some other cross-section. The way the insulated
</p>
<p>conductors are placed in the slots is illustrated in Fig. 5.6, where the front side of
</p>
<p>the stator is shown as (F), size view of the stator is shown as (G), whereas the views
</p>
<p>(H) and (I) show 3D view of the stator with one section.
</p>
<p>One turn can be obtained by a series connection of conductors placed in different
</p>
<p>slots (A&ndash;B in Fig. 5.6). The two conductors making one turn can be placed in
</p>
<p>diametrical slots, but there are also turns where this is not the case. The two
</p>
<p>conductors which belong to one turn pass through the slots and get out of the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit at the rare side. At that point, they get connected by the end turns,
</p>
<p>denoted by A, C, and D in Fig. 5.6. Conductors that are placed in slots, the end turns
</p>
<p>(D), and front connections (C) between conductors are usuallymade of a single piece
</p>
<p>of insulated copper wire.
</p>
<p>The slots under consideration may hold more than one copper conductor. There-
</p>
<p>fore, several turns may reside in the same pair of slots. These turns are connected in
</p>
<p>series. In such way, one obtains a coil or a section (C&ndash;E in Fig. 5.6). To connect the
</p>
<p>turns in series, one section has the end turns at the front side of the stator (detail C) as
</p>
<p>well as at the rear side of stator (detail D).

<p>One section can have one or more turns connected in series. Onewinding can have
</p>
<p>one or more sections connected in series. Terminals of the winding can be connected
</p>
<p>to electrical source or electrical load. They represent electrical access to the machine.
</p>
<p>Electrical machines can have several windings in the stator and/or rotor.
</p>
<p>Flux of one turn is equal to the flux through the contour determined by the
</p>
<p>conductors of the turn. Flux of a turn is denoted by F, and it is equal to the surface
</p>
<p>integral of magnetic induction over the surface leaning on the contour. Flux of a coil
</p>
<p>having N turns is equal to NF.
</p>
<p>Question (5.1): Is magnetic induction in the teeth of higher or lower intensity
compared to the rest of the magnetic circuit? Why?
</p>
<p>Answer (5.1): Flux of the machine passes through magnetic circuit of the stator
and through magnetic circuit of the rotor. Within the iron parts of the circuit, there
</p>
<p>are no air gaps of high magnetic resistance. Passing toward the air gap, lines of
</p>
<p>magnetic field get through the teeth. The equivalent cross-section is then reduced,
</p>
<p>since the field is directed toward teeth and not toward slots, where magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance is much higher. Since the same flux now passes through a smaller
</p>
<p>equivalent cross-section, magnetic induction in the teeth is higher than the induc-
</p>
<p>tion in the other parts of magnetic circuit.

<p>5.5 The Position and Notation of Winding Axis
</p>
<p>Windings can be placed in stator, rotor, or in both parts of the machine, depending
</p>
<p>on the type of electrical machine. The main types of electrical machines are DC
</p>
<p>machines, asynchronous machines, and synchronous machines. Introductory
</p>
<p>remarks on windings of electrical machines are given in Sect. 5.3 &ldquo;The Windings&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>In synchronous and DC machines, the excitation flux can be accomplished by
</p>
<p>means of permanent magnets. In such cases, the number of windings is smaller
</p>
<p>since there is no excitation winding. Asynchronous and synchronous machines are
</p>
<p>also called AC machines, and they usually have three windings in the stator called
</p>
<p>the three-phase windings. When dealing with machines which have a large number
</p>
<p>of windings, it is not practical to include a detailed presentation of all these
</p>
<p>windings. Too many details and unclear presentations do not help drawing
</p>
<p>conclusions and making decisions. Instead, each of the windings can be denoted
</p>
<p>by a simple mark which defines its axis, that is, its spatial orientation.
</p>
<p>Axis of a winding is determined by direction of the lines of magnetic field
</p>
<p>created by the currents circulating in the winding conductors. In the preceding
</p>
<p>subsections, winding is defined as a set of several conductors placed in a slot,
</p>
<p>connected in series, and accessible via winding terminals which are connected to
</p>
<p>electrical sources or electrical receivers. One turn is series connection of two
</p>
<p>conductors placed in different, mostly diametrical slots. The conductors are
</p>
<p>connected by end turns at machine ends. Gathered together, they make a contour.
</p>
<p>Electromotive forces of the two conductors are added to make the electromotive
</p>
<p>force of the turn/contour. Flux created by current in one turn has direction perpen-
</p>
<p>dicular to the surface encircled by the contour. This normal on this surface defines
</p>
<p>spatial orientation of the turn. The turns making one winding can be distributed
</p>
<p>along machine perimeter and can be of different spatial orientation.
</p>
<p>In cases where all the turns that constitute winding reside in the same pair of
</p>
<p>slots, the turns share the same magnetic axis. Electrical currents in these turns create
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force and flux in the same direction. Such winding is called
</p>
<p>concentrated winding. The winding current in concentrated winding creates mag-
</p>
<p>netic field in the air gap. Lines of this field pass through the iron core, where
</p>
<p>intensity of the field HFe is very small due to high permeability of iron. In addition,
</p>
<p>lines of the field pass through the air gap twice, as shown in Fig. 5.7. Therefore,
</p>
<p>intensity of the field in the air gap can be determined from Ni &frac14; 2H0d. Magnetic
field created by the winding has two distinct zones in the air gap, one where the
</p>
<p>lines of magnetic field come out of the rotor, pass through the air gap, and enter
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit of the stator, and the other where the field is in the opposite
</p>
<p>direction. These zones are called magnetic poles. Positions of the poles are deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the direction of the field. This direction extends along the axis of the
</p>
<p>winding. For a concentrated winding with turns made of series connected diametri-
</p>
<p>cally positioned conductors, the axis of the winding corresponds to the axis of each
</p>
<p>individual turn. This axis is perpendicular to the surface encircled by diametrical
</p>
<p>conductors.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>While analyzing electrical machines, consideration of all conductors of all
</p>
<p>windings would be too complex and of little use. Therefore, the windings are
</p>
<p>represented by special marks, similar to those of the coils. Orientations of each
</p>
<p>mark should be such that it extends along the axis of the winding. Namely, direction
</p>
<p>of the mark should be aligned with the lines of magnetic field established by
</p>
<p>electrical current in the winding. The way of marking the axis of a winding is
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 5.7.
</p>
<p>Windings of electrical machines can be made in such way that one slot contains
</p>
<p>more than one conductor. Conductors placed in one slot do not have to belong to the
</p>
<p>same winding. In a three-phase machine, there are three separate stator windings,
</p>
<p>having a total of six terminals. One slot may contain conductors belonging to two or
</p>
<p>even three separate windings. Three parts of one stator winding are often called
</p>
<p>phases (three-phase windings).
</p>
<p>5.6 Conversion Losses
</p>
<p>Conversion process in electrical machines involves power losses in magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits, in windings, and in mechanical subsystem. Losses in magnetic circuits
</p>
<p>are a consequence of alternating magnetic induction in ferromagnetic materials, and
</p>
<p>it is divided in hysteresis losses and eddy currents losses. Losses due to eddy currents
</p>
<p>can be reduced by lamination. Laminated magnetic circuit is made of iron sheets
</p>
<p>separated by thin layers of electrical insulation. In such way, eddy currents are
</p>
<p>suppressed along with eddy current losses. Winding losses are proportional to
</p>
<p>the winding resistance and square of electrical current. Mechanical losses are
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.7 Notation of a winding and its axis
</p>
<p>5.6 Conversion Losses 89</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>consequence of resistance to rotor motion. They are caused mainly by friction in the
</p>
<p>bearings and air resistance in the air gap. When electrical machine operates in the
</p>
<p>steady state motoring mode, it takes the power PeM&frac14;SuiM from the electrical power
source. In motoring mode, it is convenient to assume the reference direction for the
</p>
<p>power PeM and current iM from the source toward the machine. During the process of
</p>
<p>electromechanical conversion, certain amount of energy is lost in magnetic circuit at
</p>
<p>the rate of PFeM, also called power losses in iron. In windings, energy is lost at the
</p>
<p>rate of PCuM, also called power losses in copper. Internal mechanical power which is
</p>
<p>transferred to the rotor is the product of electromagnetic torque and speed of
</p>
<p>rotation, TemOm. Themotion resistance caused by friction in the bearings and friction
</p>
<p>in the air results in mechanical losses PgmM. Power PmM &frac14; TemOm� PgmM &frac14; TmOm
is transferred via shaft to a workmachine. In the motor mode, the source power is the
</p>
<p>machine input, power PmM is the output, whereas the sum PFeM + PCuM + PgmM
determines the power of losses. Ratio � &frac14; PmM/PeM is the coefficient of efficiency,
and it is always less than one. The balance of power for an electrical machine
</p>
<p>operating in motoring mode is shown in Fig. 5.8.
</p>
<p>In the case when machine operates in generator mode, it converts mechanical
</p>
<p>work to electrical energy. The balance of power for the generator mode is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.9. Generator receives mechanical power PmG, obtained from a hydroturbine,
</p>
<p>an endothermic motor, or some other similar device.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 5.8, the mechanical power is considered positive if it is directed from the
</p>
<p>turbine toward electrical machine. In this case, the turbine is the source of mechani-
</p>
<p>cal power. With the reference directions for power and current adopted for motoring
</p>
<p>mode (Fig. 5.8), where the power is considered positive when being supplied from
</p>
<p>the electrical machine and being delivered to the work machine, then the mechanical
</p>
<p>power Pm in generator mode has a negative value. Therefore, the reference direction
</p>
<p>in generator mode is often changed and determined so as to obtain positive values of
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.8 Balance of power
of electrical machine
</p>
<p>in motoring mode

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>power PmG, received from the turbine, and a positive value of power PeG, supplied
</p>
<p>by the generator to electrical circuits and receivers, connected to the stator winding.
</p>
<p>The same reference direction is usually taken for the electrical current iG.
</p>
<p>Power PmG represents input to the generator, and it comes from the turbine or
</p>
<p>other source of mechanical power. Within the machine, one part of the input power
</p>
<p>is lost on overcoming motion resistances encountered by the rotor. By subtracting
</p>
<p>power PgmG from input power PmG, one obtains internal mechanical power which is
</p>
<p>converted to electrical power. One part of the obtained electrical power is lost in
</p>
<p>windings, where the copper losses are PCuG, and in magnetic circuit, where the iron
</p>
<p>losses are PFeG. The remaining power is at disposal to electrical consumers supplied
</p>
<p>by the generator. At the ends of stator winding, one obtains currents and voltages
</p>
<p>which determine the generated electrical power PeG &frac14; SuiG, which can be trans-
ferred to electrical consumers.
</p>
<p>The coefficient of efficiency can be increased by designing the machine to have
</p>
<p>reduced losses windings (copper losses) and magnetic circuit (iron losses). By
</p>
<p>increasing the cross-section of conductors, the resistance of copper conductors is
</p>
<p>decreased which leads to reduced copper losses. By increasing the cross-section of
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit, the magnetic induction decreases for the same flux. Consequently,
</p>
<p>the iron losses are smaller. On the other hand, this approach to reducing the
</p>
<p>current density and magnetic induction leads to an increased volume and mass of
</p>
<p>themachine. The specific power, determined by the ratio of the power andmass of the
</p>
<p>machine, becomes smaller as well. Therefore, for an electrical machine of predefined
</p>
<p>power, decreased current and flux densities lead to an increase in quantities of copper
</p>
<p>and iron used to make the machine. At the same time, dimensions of the machine are
</p>
<p>increased as well.
</p>
<p>Design policy of reducing the flux and current densities decreases the overall
</p>
<p>energy losses in copper and iron in the course of electrical machine service.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the overall effects of this design policy may eventually be negative.
</p>
<p>Namely, the increase in efficiency is obtained on account of an increased consump-
</p>
<p>tion of iron and copper. At this point, along with the energy spent during the
</p>
<p>operating lifetime of electrical machines, it is of interest to take into account
</p>
<p>the energy spent in their manufacturing. Production of the electrolytic copper,
</p>
<p>used to make the windings, requires considerable amounts of energy. The same
</p>
<p>way, production of insulated iron sheets for making magnetic circuits requires
</p>
<p>energy. Therefore, the energy savings due to reduced copper and iron losses are
</p>
<p>counteracted by increased energy expenditure in machine manufacturing.
</p>
<p>Choice of the flux and current density in an electrical machine is made in the
</p>
<p>design phase, and it represents a compromise. For machines to be used in short time
</p>
<p>intervals, followed by prolonged periods of rest, it is beneficial to use increased flux
</p>
<p>and current density. Increased copper and iron losses are of lesser importance, as
</p>
<p>the machines are mostly at rest. On the other hand, savings in copper and iron
</p>
<p>contribute to significant reduction in energy used in machine manufacturing.
</p>
<p>Contemporary electrical motors are fed from power converters which can adjust
</p>
<p>voltages and currents of the primary source to the requirements of machines. Among
</p>
<p>other things, the possibility of varying conditions of supply is used for the purpose
</p>
<p>of bringing a machine to the operating regime where power losses are reduced.

<p>5.7 Magnetic Field in Air Gap
</p>
<p>Between stator and rotor, there is a clearance, often called air gap. In Fig. 5.10, the
</p>
<p>air gap is denoted by (C). The clearance d is considerably smaller than diameter of
</p>
<p>the machine and ranges from a fraction of millimeter for very small machines up to
</p>
<p>10 mm for large machines.
</p>
<p>The permeability of ferromagnetic materials (iron) is very large. Since the flux
</p>
<p>through the air gap is equal to the flux through magnetic circuit, similar values of
</p>
<p>magnetic induction are encountered in both the air gap and iron. Since mFe &gt;&gt; m0,
the magnetic field H in iron is negligible. It can be assumed that the magnetic field
</p>
<p>H has a significant, nonzero value H0 only in the air gap (Fig. 5.11). The contour
</p>
<p>integral of the field H is reduced to the value given by (5.2) which relates the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force F to the line integral of magnetic field along the closed
</p>
<p>contour:

</p>
<p>Doubled value of the product H0d in (5.2) exists since the lines of magnetic field
</p>
<p>pass through the air gap twice, as shown in Fig. 5.11.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Since Ni &frac14; 2H0d, it is of significance to have smaller gap d. In this way, the
required field H0 can be accomplished with a smaller current in the windings and
</p>
<p>lower losses. However, there are limits to the minimum applicable air gap. The air
</p>
<p>gap must be sufficient to ensure that the stator and rotor do not touch under any
</p>
<p>circumstances. A finite precision in manufacturing mechanical parts and a finite
</p>
<p>eccentricity of the rotor as well as the existence of elastic radial deformation of the
</p>
<p>shaft in the course of operation prevent the use of air gaps inferior to 0.5&ndash;1 mm.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, there is a risk that the rotor could scratch the stator in certain operating
</p>
<p>conditions.
</p>
<p>5.8 Field Energy, Size, and Torque
</p>
<p>Cylindrical electrical machines based on magnetic coupling field develop the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque through an interaction of magnetic field with winding
</p>
<p>currents. The available electromagnetic torque can be related to the machine size.
</p>
<p>In addition, the available torque can be estimated from the energy of the magnetic
</p>
<p>field in the electrical machine.
</p>
<p>Cylindrical electrical machines based on magnetic coupling field have an immo-
</p>
<p>bile stator and a revolving rotor. The rotor is turning around the axis of cylindrical
</p>
<p>machine. The axis is perpendicular to the cross-section of the machine presented in
</p>
<p>Figs. 5.10 and 5.11. The measure of mechanical interaction of the stator and rotor is
</p>
<p>the torque. When the torque is obtained by action of the magnetic coupling field, it
</p>
<p>is called the electromagnetic torque. The torque is created due to the interaction of
</p>
<p>the stator and rotor fields. Magnetic fields of stator and rotor can be obtained either
</p>
<p>by inserting permanent magnets into magnetic circuit or by electrical currents in the
</p>
<p>windings. Left part in Fig. 5.3 illustrates the torque which tends to align different
</p>
<p>magnetic poles of the stator and rotor. In order to determine the relation between the

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>available torque and the energy accumulated in the coupling magnetic field, it is of
</p>
<p>use to summarize the process of electromechanical conversion, taking into account
</p>
<p>the cyclic nature of the process as well as the two phases in one conversion cycle.
</p>
<p>During the first phase, electromechanical converter is connected to the electrical
</p>
<p>source. The source supplies the energy which is split in two parts. One part
</p>
<p>increases the energy accumulated in the coupling field, while the other part feeds
</p>
<p>the process of electromechanical conversion. During the second phase of the
</p>
<p>conversion cycles, the electrical source is disconnected from the electromechanical
</p>
<p>converter, and the mechanical energy is obtained from the energy stored in the
</p>
<p>coupling field. In Fig. 5.12, marks Wi, Wmeh, and Wm denote energy of the source,
</p>
<p>mechanical energy obtained from the converter, and energy accumulated in the
</p>
<p>magnetic coupling field, respectively. The cycle of electromechanical conversion in
</p>
<p>converters with magnetic coupling field is analogous to the cycle of converters
</p>
<p>based on electrical coupling field, the later being described in Sect. 3.1.4, Conver-
</p>
<p>sion Cycle.
</p>
<p>In the case when the source is separated from machine windings (Fig. 5.12a), the
</p>
<p>voltage across terminals of the winding is u � NdF/dt &frac14; 0. Neglecting the voltage
drop Ri, the flux in a short-circuited winding is constant. In the absence of electrical
</p>
<p>source, mechanical work can be obtained only on account of the energy of the
</p>
<p>coupling field. Therefore, in such conditions, dWmeh &frac14; �dWm. This assertion can
be illustrated by example where a mobile iron piece is brought into magnetic field
</p>
<p>of a coil. A shift dx of the iron piece produces mechanical work dWmeh &frac14; Fdx,
where F is the force acting on the piece. Self-inductance of the coil L(x) is
</p>
<p>dependent on the position of the piece of iron, as the piece changes the magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance to the coil flux. In the case when this coil is separated from the source and
</p>
<p>short circuited, and resistance R of the coil is negligible, the first derivative of the

<p>If the electrical source is connected (Fig. 5.12b), electrical current in the winding
</p>
<p>is determined by the source current I. The current is constant, while the flux
</p>
<p>changes. Upon shift dx, the source delivers energy dWi &frac14; u I dt, where u &frac14; dC/dt
is the voltage across the coil terminals. Work of the source is given by (5.5):
</p>
<p>dWi &frac14; u I dt &frac14; I d C: (5.5)
</p>
<p>Since the coil current is constant, the corresponding increase of energy of the
</p>
<p>magnetic field can be obtained by applying (5.6):

<p>From the previous equation, it follows that work of the source is split to equal
</p>
<p>parts2 dWm &frac14; dWmeh &frac14; dWi/2. Expression for the force acting on the mobile piece
of iron in cases where the source is connected is F &frac14; &frac12; I2dL/dt, which corresponds
to expression (5.4), developed for the case when the source is disconnected and the
</p>
<p>coil is short circuited.
</p>
<p>Neither of the two described processes could last for a long time. If the source is
</p>
<p>disconnected permanently, the energy of the coupling field Wm is converted to
</p>
<p>2Distribution of the work delivered by the source corresponds to expressions dWm &frac14; dWmeh &frac14;
dWi/2 if the medium is linear, that is, if permeability m of the medium does not depend on the field
</p>
<p>strength. Then, the coefficient of self-inductance L(x) depends exclusively on the position x of the
</p>
<p>iron piece. Thus, ratio C/I does not depend neither on flux nor on the electrical current. Under the
</p>
<p>described conditions, the statements (5.5) and (5.6) are correct. Consequently, relations dWm &frac14;
dWmeh &frac14; dWi/2 hold as well. In cases when magnetic induction in iron reaches the level of
magnetic saturation, the characteristic of magnetization of iron B(H) becomes nonlinear. The
</p>
<p>saturation is followed by a drop in permeability m of the medium (iron). In such cases, inductance
</p>
<p>of the coil is a function of both position and flux, L&frac14;C/i &frac14; f(x,C). Consequently, the expression for
increase of the field energy would take another form. Subsequent analysis leads to the conclusion
</p>
<p>that with nonlinear medium, the work of the source is not to be split in two equal parts.

<p>source be permanently connected, one part of the source energy is converted to
</p>
<p>mechanical work, while the other part increases energy of the field. An increase in
</p>
<p>the field energy is followed by a raise in the magnetic field H and magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B. Magnetic induction in a magnetic circuit comprising iron parts cannot
</p>
<p>increase indefinitely. Accumulation of energyWm is limited by magnetic saturation
</p>
<p>in iron sheets, which limits magnetic induction to Bmax &lt; (1.7 � 2)T. Since neither
of the two phases in one conversion cycle cannot persist indefinitely, they have to
</p>
<p>be altered in order to keep the field energy within limits. Therefore, the electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical conversion is performed in cycles which include interval when the source
</p>
<p>is disconnected (left side of Fig. 5.12) and interval when the source is connected
</p>
<p>(right side of the figure). An interval when the source is connected must be followed
</p>
<p>by another interval when the source is disconnected in order to prevent an excessive
</p>
<p>increase or decrease of the energy accumulated in the coupling field.
</p>
<p>The expressions for electrical force given by (3.7) and (3.9) can be applied in the
</p>
<p>cases when the medium is linear, that is, when permeability m of the medium does
</p>
<p>not depend on the field strength.
</p>
<p>All electromechanical converters are operating in cycles. In the first phase,
</p>
<p>mechanical work is obtained from the source, while in the second phase, it
</p>
<p>comes from the energy accumulated in the coupling field. The cyclic connection
</p>
<p>and disconnection of the source does not have to be made by a switch. Instead, the
</p>
<p>electrical source can be made in such way to provide a pulsating or alternating
</p>
<p>voltage which periodically changes direction or stays zero for a certain amount of
</p>
<p>time within each cycle. In the case of an AC voltage supply, the cycle of electro-
</p>
<p>mechanical conversion is determined by the cycle of the supply voltage. The
</p>
<p>mechanical work which can be obtained within one cycle is comparable to
</p>
<p>the energy of the coupling field. In the example presented in Fig. 5.12, energy of
</p>
<p>the coupling field assumes its maximum value Wm(max) at the instant when the
</p>
<p>source is switched off. If the field energy is reduced to zero at the end of the cycle,
</p>
<p>then the mechanical work obtained during one full cycle is twice the peak energy
</p>
<p>of the field, Wmeh(1) &frac14; 2Wm(max). For rotating machines, one cycle is usually
determined by one turn of the rotor.3 Mechanical work obtained by action of the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque Tem during one turn is equal to the product of the torque and
</p>
<p>angular path (2pTem). Therefore, the electromagnetic torque of an electrical
</p>
<p>machine can be estimated on the basis of the peak energy accumulated in the
</p>
<p>coupling field.
</p>
<p>The relevant values of magnetic field H are exclusively those in the air gap. In
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic materials, the field H is negligible due to a rather large permeability.
</p>
<p>Therefore, energy of the coupling field is located mainly in the air gap.
</p>
<p>Product of the torque Tem and angular speed of rotation Om is the mechanical
</p>
<p>power which is transferred to work machine via shaft. In the case of a generator, the
</p>
<p>energy is converted in the opposite direction. Namely, mechanical work is

</p>
<p>Question (5.2): If dimensions of a machine and the peak value of magnetic
induction are known, estimate the electromagnetic torque which can be developed
</p>
<p>by this machine.
</p>
<p>Answer (5.2): Energy accumulated in the electromagnetic field is located mainly
in the air gap. Volume of the air gap is V &frac14; pLDd, where D is diameter of the
machine, L is axial length, and d is the air gap. Magnetic induction B in the air gap
</p>
<p>depends on electrical current in the winding. Lines of the magnetic field which pass
</p>
<p>through the air gap enter the ferromagnetic material. Usually, the ferromagnetic
</p>
<p>parts are made of iron sheets which make up the stator and rotor magnetic circuits.
</p>
<p>Therefore, induction in the air gap cannot exceed value Bmax � 1.7 T. Excessive
values of B would cause magnetic saturation in the iron sheets. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>density of energy accumulated in magnetic field in the air gap cannot exceed &frac12;
</p>
<p>Bmax
2/m0. The maximum energy of the coupling field can be estimated asWm(max) �

<p>&frac12; pLDdBmax
2/m0, while the electromagnetic torque of the machine can be estimated
</p>
<p>by dividing the obtained energy by 2p.

<p>Modeling Electrical Machines
</p>
<p>This chapter introduces, develops and explains generalized mathematical model of
</p>
<p>electrical machines. It explains the need for modeling, introduces and explains
</p>
<p>approximations and neglected phenomena, and formulates generalized model as a
</p>
<p>set of differential and algebraic equations.
</p>
<p>Working with electrical machines requires mathematical representation of the
</p>
<p>process of electromechanical conversion. It is necessary to determine equations
</p>
<p>which correlate the electrical quantities of the machine, such as the voltages and
</p>
<p>currents, with mechanical quantities such as the speed and torque. These equations
</p>
<p>provide the link between the electrical access to the machine (terminals of the
</p>
<p>windings) and the mechanical access to the machine (shaft). The two accesses to
</p>
<p>the machine are shown in Fig. 6.1, which illustrates the process of electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversions and presents the principal losses and the energy accumulated in mag-
</p>
<p>netic field. Equations of the mathematical model are used to calculate changes in
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque, electromotive forces, currents, speed, and other relevant
</p>
<p>variables. Besides, the model helps calculating conversion losses in windings, in
</p>
<p>magnetic circuits, and in mechanical parts of the machine.
</p>
<p>The set of equations describing transient processes in electrical machines
</p>
<p>contains differential and algebraic equations, and it is also called dynamic model.
</p>
<p>Operation of a machine in steady states is described by the steady state equivalent
</p>
<p>scheme, which gives relations between voltages and currents at the winding
</p>
<p>terminals, and by mechanical characteristic, which describes relation between the
</p>
<p>torque and speed at the mechanical access. In the following subsection, an intro-
</p>
<p>duction to the modeling of electrical machines is presented. Figure 6.1 presents a
</p>
<p>diagram showing power of the source Pe, mechanical power Pm, winding losses
</p>

</p>
<p>resistance losses), and energy of the coupling field Wm.

<p>6.1 The Need for Modeling
</p>
<p>A good knowledge of electrical machines is a prerogative for successful work of
</p>
<p>electrical engineers. Knowledge of the equivalent schemes in steady states and
</p>
<p>mechanical characteristics is required for selecting a machine which would be
</p>
<p>adequate for a particular application, for designing systems containing electrical
</p>
<p>machines, as well as for solving the problems which may arise in industry and power
</p>
<p>engineering. Knowledge of the dynamic model of electrical machines is necessary
</p>
<p>for solving the control problems of generators and motors, for designing protection
</p>
<p>and monitoring systems, for determining the structures and control parameters in
</p>
<p>robotics, as well as for solving the problems in automation of production, electrical
</p>
<p>vehicles, and other similar applications.
</p>
<p>In all cases mentioned above, one should know the basic concepts concerning the
</p>
<p>size,mass, construction, reliability, and coefficient of efficiencyof electricalmachines.
</p>
<p>Further on, a general model of electrical machines is presented in this section.
</p>
<p>Along with the model, common approximations made in the course of modeling are
</p>
<p>listed, explained, and justified. The main purpose of studying the general model is
</p>
<p>to determine the dynamic model for commonly used electrical machines and to
</p>
<p>obtain their steady state equivalent schemes and mechanical characteristics.
</p>
<p>The diagram shown in Fig. 6.1 presents power Pe which the electromechanical
</p>
<p>system receives from the source, power Pm which is transferred via shaft to the
</p>
<p>mechanical subsystem, losses in the electrical subsystem PCu, iron losses PFe, as
</p>
<p>well as the losses due to friction Pgm in the mechanical subsystem. It is necessary to
</p>
<p>develop corresponding mathematical model which describes the phenomena within
</p>
<p>the electromechanical converter shown in Fig. 6.1.
</p>
<p>What is a good model? How to obtain a good model?
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a model is a mathematical representation of the system
</p>
<p>which is under consideration. In most cases, less significant interactions are
</p>
<p>neglected, and then, a simplified representation is obtained, yet still adequate for
</p>
<p>the purposes and uses. In electrical engineering, a model is usually a set of
</p>
<p>differential equations describing behavior of certain system. In some cases, like
</p>
<p>steady state operation, these equations can be reduced to an equivalent electrical
</p>
<p>circuit (expressions replacement scheme, replacement circuit, and equivalent
</p>
<p>scheme are also used).

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The phenomena and systems of interest for an electrical engineer are usually
</p>
<p>complex and include some interactions which are not of uttermost importance and
</p>
<p>should not be taken into account. Considering gas pressure pushing the head of a
</p>
<p>piston in the cylinder of an endothermic motor, the action is the result of continuous
</p>
<p>collisions of a large number of gas particles with the surface of the piston. Strictly
</p>
<p>speaking, the force is not constant, but it consists of a very large number of strikes
</p>
<p>(pulses) per second. However, in the analysis of the torque which the motor transfers
</p>
<p>to the work machine, only the average value of the force is of interest. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>effects of micro strikes are neglected, and the force is considered to be proportional
</p>
<p>to the surface of the piston head and to the gas pressure in the cylinder.
</p>
<p>In electrical engineering, passive components, such as resistors, capacitors, and
</p>
<p>inductive coils (chokes), are very often mentioned and used. Strictly speaking,
</p>
<p>models of real chokes, capacitors, and resistors are more complex compared to
</p>
<p>widely accepted models that are rather simple. At high frequencies, influences of
</p>
<p>parasitic inductance and equivalent series resistance of a capacitor become notice-
</p>
<p>able. Under similar conditions, parallel capacitance of a choke cannot be neglected
</p>
<p>at very high frequencies. Similar conclusion can be made for a resistor. In a rigorous
</p>
<p>analysis, real components would have to be modeled as networks with distributed
</p>
<p>parameter. Yet the frequencies of interest are often low. At low frequencies,
</p>
<p>parasitic effects are negligible, and the well-known elements R, L, and C are
</p>
<p>considered as lumped parameter circuit elements described by relations Ri &frac14; u,
u &frac14; Ldi/dt, and i &frac14; Cdu/dt. Therefore, parasitic effects and distributed parameters
do not have to be taken into account when solving problems and tasks at low
</p>
<p>frequencies. In cases when all the parasitic and secondary effects are modeled, the
</p>
<p>considered RLC networks become rather complex, and their analysis becomes
</p>
<p>difficult. Drawing conclusions or making design decisions based upon too complex
</p>
<p>models becomes virtually impossible.
</p>
<p>Therefore, a good model is not the one that takes into account all aspects of
</p>
<p>dynamic behavior of a system, but the one which is simplified by justifiable
</p>
<p>approximations, thus facilitating and improving the process of making conclusions
</p>
<p>and taking design decisions, while retaining all relevant (significant) phenomena
</p>
<p>within the system. It is not possible to develop an analytical expression which
</p>
<p>would help in defining the relevance, but in making approximations, it is necessary
</p>
<p>to distinguish the essential from nonessential on the basis of a deeper knowledge of
</p>
<p>the system and material and through the use of experience. A tip to apprentices in
</p>
<p>modeling conventional electrical machines is to take into account all the phenom-
</p>
<p>ena up to several tens of kHz and to neglect the processes at higher frequencies.
</p>
<p>6.1.1 Problems of Modeling
</p>
<p>In the process of modeling, it is required to neglect insignificant phenomena in
</p>
<p>order to obtain a simple, clear-cut, and usable model. For successful modeling and
</p>
<p>use of the model, it is necessary to make correct judgment as regards phenomena
</p>
<p>6.1 The Need for Modeling 101</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>that can be neglected. If important phenomena are neglected or overlooked, the
</p>
<p>result of modeling will not be usable. Here, an example is presented which shows
</p>
<p>that taking correct decisions often relies on a wider knowledge of the considered
</p>
<p>objects and phenomena which is acquired by engineering practice.
</p>
<p>Consider a capacitor which consists of two parallel plates with a dielectric of
</p>
<p>thickness d in between. It is customary to consider that the field in dielectric is
</p>
<p>homogeneous and equal to E &frac14; U/d. If this capacitor is used in a system where its
high-frequency characteristics are not significant, it can be considered ideal and
</p>
<p>its interelectrode field homogeneous. Consider the case when a pulse-shaped
</p>
<p>voltage having a very large slope dV/dt is connected to the plates. At low
</p>
<p>frequencies, the capacitor can still be considered ideal since the simplification
</p>
<p>made cannot be of any influence to the low-frequency response. However, it is
</p>
<p>possible that a very high dV/dt values result in breakdown of dielectric, even in
</p>
<p>cases where the steady state field strength E &frac14; U/d is considerably smaller than the
dielectric strength. The term dielectric strength corresponds to the maximum
</p>
<p>sustainable electric field in dielectric, exceeding of which results in breakdown of
</p>
<p>the dielectric. High dV/dt contributes to a transient nonuniform distribution of
</p>
<p>electric field between the plates, with E &lt; U/d in the middle and E &gt; U/d next to
the plates. Namely, what actually happens in the process of feeding the voltage
</p>
<p>to the plates is, in fact, propagation of an electromagnetic wave which comes from
</p>
<p>the source and is directed by conductors (waveguides) toward the plates. The
</p>
<p>propagation of the electromagnetic wave continues in the dielectric; therefore,
</p>
<p>the highest intensity of the electric field is in the vicinity of the plates, whereas in
</p>
<p>the space between the plates, it is lower. Uneven initial distribution of the field is
</p>
<p>established within a very short interval of time, which is dependent on dimensions
</p>
<p>and is of the order of nanoseconds.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of this uneven field distribution, the process of an abrupt
</p>
<p>voltage rise (very high slope dV/dt) may lead to a situation when, for a short time,
</p>
<p>the field exceeds dielectric strength of the material in close vicinity of the capacitor
</p>
<p>plates, even in cases when E &frac14; U/d is very small. A breakdown results in destruc-
tion of the structure and chemical contents of the dielectric, but nevertheless, it has
</p>
<p>local character. The damaged zones of the dielectric are next to the plates, whereas
</p>
<p>toward inside the dielectric is preserved. However, if described incidents occur
</p>
<p>frequently (say 10,000 times per second), damaged zones tend to spread, and they
</p>
<p>change characteristics of the capacitor. Prolonged operation in the prescribed way
</p>
<p>eventually leads to dielectric breakdown between the plates, and it puts the capaci-
</p>
<p>tor out of service. Similar phenomenon occurs in insulation of AC motors fed from
</p>
<p>three-phase transistor inverters, commonly used to provide the so-called U/f fre-
</p>
<p>quency control. Three-phase inverters provide variable voltage by feeding a train of
</p>
<p>voltage pulses to the motor. The pulse frequency is next to 10 kHz. The width of the
</p>
<p>pulses is altered so as to obtain the desired change in the average voltage (PWM &ndash;
</p>
<p>pulse width modulation). The voltage pulses are of very sharp edges, with consid-
</p>
<p>erable values of dV/dt, and they bring up an additional stress to the insulation of the
</p>
<p>windings. Hence, certain high-frequency phenomena cannot be neglected when
</p>
<p>analyzing PWM-supplied electrical machines.

<p>The example considered above requires a deeper understanding of the process
</p>
<p>and is founded on experience. The knowledge required for thorough understanding
</p>
<p>of given example is not a prerequisite for further reading. However, it is of interest
</p>
<p>to recognize the need to enrich the studies by laboratory work, practice, written
</p>
<p>papers, and projects, acquiring in this way the experience necessary for a successful
</p>
<p>engineering practice. A successful engineer combines the theoretical knowledge,
</p>
<p>skill in solving analytically solvable problems, but also the experience in modeling
</p>
<p>processes and phenomena. In order to make the most out of the knowledge and skill,
</p>
<p>it is necessary primarily to use the experience and deeper understanding of the
</p>
<p>process of electromechanical conversion and reduce a complex system to a mathe-
</p>
<p>matical model to be used in further work.
</p>
<p>6.1.2 Conclusion
</p>
<p>A good model is the simplest possible model still representing the relevant aspects
</p>
<p>of the dynamic behavior of a system &ndash; process &ndash; machine in a satisfactory way.
</p>
<p>In the process of generating models, justifiable approximations are made in order
</p>
<p>to make a simple model suitable for recognizing relevant and significant phenom-
</p>
<p>ena, for making conclusions, and for taking engineering and design decisions.
</p>
<p>When introducing the approximations, care should be taken that these do not
</p>
<p>jeopardize the accuracy to the extent that makes the model useless.
</p>
<p>This book is the first encounter with cylindrical electromechanical converters
</p>
<p>with magnetic coupling field for a number of readers. Therefore, initial steps in
</p>
<p>machine analysis and modeling are made with certain approximations. Among the
</p>
<p>four principal approximations, the losses in magnetic circuits or iron losses are also
</p>
<p>neglected. Omission of these losses makes the basic models of electrical machines
</p>
<p>easier to understand. In most electrical machines, iron losses are marginalized by
</p>
<p>lamination, and the mentioned approximation is partially justifiable. It is necessary,
</p>
<p>however, to have in mind that at higher frequencies and larger magnetic induction,
</p>
<p>the iron losses can be considerable and should be taken into account in calculating
</p>
<p>the total losses and coefficient of efficiency, as well as in designing the corres-
</p>
<p>ponding cooling systems.
</p>
<p>6.2 Neglected Phenomena
</p>
<p>In the course of developing a model, it is justifiable to neglect less significant
</p>
<p>phenomena, the omission of which does not cause significant deviations of the
</p>
<p>obtained results. The four most common approximations are:
</p>
<p>&bull; The system is considered as a lumped parameter network.
</p>
<p>&bull; Parasitic capacitances are neglected.
</p>
<p>6.2 Neglected Phenomena 103</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; The iron losses are neglected.
</p>
<p>&bull; Ferromagnetic materials are considered linear
</p>
<p>6.2.1 Distributed Energy and Distributed Parameters
</p>
<p>Electrical machines are usually considered as networks with lumped parameters
</p>
<p>and represented by circuits comprising discrete inductances and resistances. Con-
</p>
<p>sidering actual L and C elements, the coil energy resides in spatially distributed
</p>
<p>magnetic field, while the capacitor energy resides in spatially distributed electrical
</p>
<p>field. It is well known1 that changes in magnetic field give a rise to induced
</p>
<p>electrical field and vice versa. The induced field is proportional to the rate of change
</p>
<p>of the inducting field, that is, to the operating frequency. Hence, a coil with an AC
</p>
<p>current is surrounded by magnetic field, but also with an induced electrical field, the
</p>
<p>strength of which depends on the operating frequency. Similar conclusion can be
</p>
<p>drawn for a capacitor. The presence of both fields contributes to parasitic capaci-
</p>
<p>tance of the coil and parasitic inductance of the capacitor.
</p>
<p>Lumped parameter approach neglects the spatial distribution of the coil and
</p>
<p>capacitor energy. It is assumed that both energies reside within discrete elements
</p>
<p>and that the amounts &frac12;Li2 and &frac12;Cu2 do not reside in space. The coils and capacitors
</p>
<p>are considered ideal, lumped parameter L-C elements. The adopted models are
</p>
<p>uL &frac14; Ldi/dt and iC &frac14; Cdu/dt, neglecting the secondary effects such as capacitance
of a coil or inductance of a capacitor. With the induced fields being proportional
</p>
<p>to the operating frequency, lumped parameter approach introduces a negligible error
</p>
<p>at relatively low frequencies that are in use in typical applications of electrical
</p>
<p>machines.
</p>
<p>One of the consequences of neglecting distributed energy and distributed
</p>
<p>parameters is concealing the energy transfer. In a lumped parameter network, a
</p>
<p>pair of conductors with electrical current i and voltage u transmits the energy at
</p>
<p>a rate of p &frac14; ui. This expression involves macroscopic quantities like voltage and
current and suggests that the energy passes through conductors. In reality, the
</p>
<p>energy is transmitted through the surrounding space with the presence of electrical
</p>
<p>and magnetic field.
</p>
<p>6.2.2 Neglecting Parasitic Capacitances
</p>
<p>For electrical machines operating on the basis of a magnetic coupling field, the
</p>
<p>effects of parasitic capacitances of the windings and the amounts of energy
</p>
<p>accumulated in the electrical field are negligible. Since the spatial density of
</p>
<p>1Consider Maxwell equations, such as rot ~E &frac14; �@~B=@t:
</p>
<p>104 6 Modeling Electrical Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>magnetic field is considerably higher than that of electrical field (mH2 &raquo; eE2), it is
</p>
<p>justified to neglect the capacitances between insulated conductors and capacitances
</p>
<p>between the windings and magnetic circuit.
</p>
<p>6.2.3 Neglecting Iron Losses
</p>
<p>It is considered that the losses due to hysteresis and losses due to eddy currents are
</p>
<p>considerably smaller compared to the power of conversion; thus, they can be
</p>
<p>neglected. Specific losses in ferromagnetic materials (iron losses) are dependent
</p>
<p>on magnetic induction and operating frequency and they can be represented by the
</p>
<p>following expression:
</p>
<p>pFe &frac14;
PFe
</p>
<p>m
&frac14; pH &thorn; pV &frac14; sH � f � Bm2 &thorn; sV � f 2 � Bm2:
</p>
<p>Since the losses due to eddy currents are dependent on squared frequency and
</p>
<p>squared magnetic induction, the iron losses are to be reconsidered in cases when
</p>
<p>electrical machine operates with elevated frequencies. In such cases, it is necessary
</p>
<p>to check whether neglecting the iron losses can be justified.
</p>
<p>6.2.4 Neglecting Iron Nonlinearity
</p>
<p>The characteristic of magnetization of magnetic materials is considered linear.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the effects of saturation of the ferromagnetic material (iron) are neglected.
</p>
<p>PermeabilityB/H is considered constant and equal to differential permeabilityDB/DH
</p>
<p>at all operating points of the magnetization characteristic. In applications where
</p>
<p>induction exceeds 1.2T, it is necessary to check whether this is justified.
</p>
<p>General model of electrical machine based onmagnetic coupling field is developed
</p>
<p>hereafter relying on the four basic approximationsmentioned above. It is assumed that
</p>
<p>the converter has N windings which can be either short-circuited or connected to a
</p>
<p>source. The windings are mounted on the rotor or stator.
</p>
<p>6.3 Power of Electrical Sources
</p>
<p>Figure 6.2 shows a converter having N magnetically coupled contours (windings)
</p>
<p>which could be either connected to a power source or separated from it and brought
</p>
<p>into short circuit. Windings of electrical machines can be fed from current or
</p>
<p>voltage sources. Real voltage sources have finite internal resistance (impedance),
</p>
<p>whereas current sources have finite internal conductance (admittance). With no loss
</p>
<p>in generality, in further text, it is assumed that electrical sources are ideal.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In windings connected to a current source, winding current is constant and

</p>
<p>the voltage balance in the winding is given by expression u &frac14; Ri + dC/dt &frac14; 0.
If resistance of the winding is negligible, then dC/dt &frac14; 0, and flux in the short-
circuited winding is constant. In the case where the winding terminals are connected
</p>
<p>to a voltage source, voltage of the source determines the change of flux (u� dC/dt).
Electrical power delivered by the sources to the electromechanical converter
</p>
<p>is determined by (6.1), where u and i are vector-columns with their elements being
</p>
<p>voltages and currents of individual windings. The expression for the power the
</p>
<p>sources deliver to the machine does not depend on whether the windings are
</p>
<p>connected to current sources and voltage sources or are short-circuited.

<p>for the current. Then, the force is eEMF &frac14; �dC/dt. Quantity �dC/dt is the electro-
motive force induced in the winding, as shown in Fig. 6.3, in the part denoted by (B).
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is possible to alter the reference direction and sign (e &frac14;
&thorn;dC/dt), as shown in the part (A) of Fig. 6.3. Quantity eCEMF &frac14; +dC/dt is the
counter-electromotive force induced in the winding.
</p>
<p>Approach (B) is used in majority of courses in Electrical Engineering
</p>
<p>Fundamentals and Electromagnetics, since it undoubtedly illustrates the circumstance
</p>
<p>that in each contour, the induced electromotive force and current are opposing the
</p>
<p>change of flux. For example in the case that intensity of the current decreases, flux
</p>
<p>through the contour decreases, and a positive value e &frac14; �dC/dt appears. Taking into
account that sign &thorn; is pointed downward, it is concluded that the induced
electromotive force supports current in the circuit opposing the change of flux.
</p>
<p>Approach (A) results in an equivalent scheme where the reference positive
</p>
<p>terminals of the voltage and electromotive force are pointed upward. Taking that
</p>
<p>e &frac14; &thorn;dC/dt, current in the circuit can be determined as ratio (u &ndash; e)/R. Defined in this
way, the electromotive force opposes the voltage; thus, it is called counter-
</p>
<p>electromotive force. Approach (A) is often applied when solving electrical circuits
</p>
<p>containing electromotive forces, as is the case of replacement schemes of electrical
</p>
<p>machines. The question of choice of the reference direction of the electromotive force
</p>
<p>is not of essential significance since the choice does not lead to essential changes in
</p>
<p>voltage balance equation in the winding. In the Anglo-Saxon, German, and Russian
</p>
<p>literatures, the approaches are different, which should confuse the reader. In practice,
</p>
<p>both approaches are accepted, provided that the adopted reference direction
</p>
<p>corresponds to the sign taken for the electromotive force (e &frac14; &thorn;/� dC/dt).
Electromotive force and counter-electromotive force induced in a contour are
</p>
<p>discussed further on, in Chap. 10, &ldquo;Electromotive Forces Induced in the Windings.&rdquo;

<p>where uk, ik, Rk, and Ck are the voltage, current, resistance, and flux of the kth
</p>
<p>winding, respectively. Flux Ck in kth winding is the sum of all the fluxes that pass
</p>
<p>through the winding, whatever the cause of relevant magnetic field. This flux is a
</p>
<p>consequence of the electrical current in kth winding itself, as well as the currents in
</p>
<p>other windings that are magnetically coupled to k-th winding. The part of the flux
</p>
<p>Ck caused by the current ik is equal to Lkkik. The coefficient Lkk is also called self-
</p>
<p>inductance of the winding. Self-inductance is expressed in H &frac14; Wb/A, and it is
strictly positive. In cases where the current in the winding ik is the only originator of
</p>
<p>magnetic field, the flux in the winding is Ck &frac14; Lkkik. Electrical currents in
remaining windings (Fig. 6.2.) can also contribute to the flux Ck. Current ij in the

<p>turns of the winding j changes the fluxCk proportionally to the coefficient of mutual
</p>
<p>inductance between windings k and j, Lkj. Parameter Lkj can be positive, negative, or

<p>zero. Spatial orientation of the two windings may be such that a positive current in

</p>
<p>Along the main diagonal of inductance matrix, there are self-inductances of
</p>
<p>individual windings, while the remaining coefficients residing off the main diago-
</p>
<p>nal are mutual inductances. Since Lij &frac14; Lji, the inductance matrix is symmetrical,
that is, L &frac14; LT.
</p>
<p>Elements of the inductance matrix can be variable. Variations of the self-
</p>
<p>inductances and mutual inductances can be due to relative movement of the moving
</p>
<p>parts of the electromechanical converter (rotor) with respect to the immobile parts
</p>
<p>(stator). Windings may exist in both parts; thus, the movement causes changes in
</p>
<p>relative positions of individual windings. For each winding, it is possible to define
</p>
<p>the winding axis (Sect. 5.5). Considering a pair of windings, rotation of one with
</p>
<p>respect to the other changes the angle between their axes. Consequently, their
</p>
<p>mutual inductance is also changed. The rotor motion can also change self-
</p>
<p>inductances. Self-inductance of a winding depends on the magnetic resistance Rm.
</p>
<p>Considering a stator winding, its flux passes through the stator magnetic circuit,
</p>
<p>passes through the air gap, and proceeds through the rotor magnetic circuit. There
</p>
<p>are cases where the rotor has unequal magnetic resistances in different directions.
</p>
<p>In such cases, the rotor motion changes the equivalent magnetic resistance Rm of
</p>
<p>the stator winding and changes the self-inductance of the winding. An example
</p>
<p>where movement changes self-inductance of the winding is given in Fig. 2.6,
</p>
<p>where the magnetic resistance decreases and self-inductance increases by inserting
</p>
<p>a piece of iron in the magnetic circuit of the coil.
</p>
<p>6.6 Leakage Flux
</p>
<p>With the current ik being the sole originator of magnetic field, the flux in kth
</p>
<p>winding is Ck &frac14; Lkk ik. One portion of this flux passes to other windings as well,
and it is called mutual flux. The remaining flux encircles only the kth winding

<p>and does not pass to any other winding. As this component, in a way, &ldquo;misses
</p>
<p>the opportunity&rdquo; to effectuate magnetic coupling, it is also called leakage flux.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.4 depicts the mutual and leakage fluxes of a system having two windings,
</p>
<p>one on stator and the other on rotor. The flux in one turn is denoted by F. Fluxes of
</p>
<p>individual windings are obtained by multiplying flux in each turn F by the number
</p>
<p>of turns.
</p>
<p>Self-inductances of the stator and rotor windings are equal to the ratio of the flux
</p>
<p>established due to the winding current and the current intensity. In other words,
</p>
<p>self-inductance is the ratio of the flux and current of the winding in cases where the
</p>
<p>flux does not get affected by external magnetic fields or by currents in other
</p>
<p>windings, but it is the consequence of the electrical current in the winding itself.
</p>
<p>In a system comprising a number of coupled windings, self-inductance of the
</p>
<p>considered winding can be determined by dividing the flux and current in
</p>
<p>conditions when all the remaining windings are with zero current. Self-inductances
</p>
<p>of practical windings are strictly positive, whereas mutual inductances could be
</p>
<p>negative. Mutual inductance of the stator and rotor windings determines the mea-
</p>
<p>sure of the contribution of stator current to the total flux of the rotor winding. Since
</p>
<p>LSR &frac14; LRS &frac14; Lm, the impact of stator currents on rotor flux is the same as the
impact of rotor currents on stator flux. By rotation, relative positions of the two
</p>
<p>windings may become such that positive current in one winding reduces the flux in
</p>
<p>the other, thus resulting in a negative value of the mutual inductance. For the system
</p>
<p>of windings shown in Fig. 6.4, the matrix of inductances is of dimensions 2 � 2.
Along the main diagonal of the matrix, there are positive coefficients of self-
</p>
<p>induction LS and LR. At the remaining places of the matrix are mutual inductances
</p>
<p>that may be positive, negative, or equal to zero, which is the case when the winding

<p>k &frac14; Lmffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
LSLR
</p>
<p>p :
</p>
<p>The coefficient k is a measure of magnetic coupling of the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>windings. In cases where the leakage flux is negligible, all of the flux is mutual,
</p>
<p>and it encircles both windings. In such cases, k &frac14; 1. As the leakage flux increases,
the mutual flux decreases as well as the coefficient k. In cases when the two
</p>
<p>windings do not have any mutual flux, k &frac14; 0. It is important to notice that k cannot
exceed 1.
</p>
<p>Relation between the mutual inductance Lm and coefficient k can be illustrated
</p>
<p>by the example where the stator and rotor windings have the same axis and the same
</p>
<p>number of turns N. If the magnetic resistance Rm is the same, the self-inductances
</p>
<p>are equal, LS &frac14; LR &frac14; N2/ Rm, while the mutual inductance is Lm &frac14; kLS &frac14; kLR.
Since k &lt; 1, mutual inductance is smaller than the self-inductance. With the
introduced assumptions, the difference,
</p>
<p>LgS &frac14; LS � Lm &frac14; &eth;1� k&THORN;LS
</p>
<p>is called leakage inductance of the stator, a measure of the leakage flux which
</p>
<p>encircles the stator winding and does not reach to the rotor winding. A stronger
</p>
<p>magnetic coupling between the windings means the higher coupling coefficient and
</p>
<p>the smaller leakage flux and leakage inductance. The example outlined above
</p>
<p>assumes that NS &frac14; NR. It is of interest to consider the leakage flux and leakage
inductance in the case when the windings have different magnetic circuits and
</p>
<p>different numbers of turns.

<p>6.7 Energy of the Coupling Field
</p>
<p>The coupling field has a key role in the process of electromechanical conversion.
</p>
<p>The energy obtained from the source can be accumulated in the coupling field and
</p>
<p>then taken from the field and converted to mechanical work. It is of significance
</p>
<p>to determine the relation between the energy of this field, winding currents, and
</p>
<p>112 6 Modeling Electrical Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>parameters such as the self-inductances and mutual inductances. Spatial density of
</p>
<p>energy accumulated in the coupling magnetic field is
</p>
<p>wm &frac14;
&eth;
</p>
<p>~H � d~B:
</p>
<p>In linear media, permeability m &frac14; B/H is constant. Therefore, the energy density
in the coupling field is equal to wm &frac14; &frac12;BH &frac14; &frac12;mH
</p>
<p>2. Total energy can be obtained
</p>
<p>by integrating the density wm over the domain where the field exists. The field
</p>
<p>energy can be expressed as function of electrical currents and winding inductances
</p>
<p>such as LS, LR, Lm, and similar. Mutual inductance between coils L1 and L2 is
</p>
<p>denoted by Lm or by L12 &frac14; Lm. For a system with two coupled windings, the field
energy is equal to f(i1, i2, L1, L2, L12) &frac14; &frac12;L1i1
</p>
<p>2 &thorn; &frac12;L2i2
2 + L12 i1 i2. A rigorous
</p>
<p>proof of this statement is omitted at this point. Instead, it is supported by
</p>
<p>considerations which indicate that the spatial integral of energy density wm
corresponds to f(i1, i2, L1, L2, L12). Spatial integration of the energy density involves
</p>
<p>the sum of minute energy portions &frac12;BH/dV comprised in infinitesimal volumes dV.
</p>
<p>Taking into account that dV &frac14; dS/dx, the problem can be reduced to calculating
integral (&frac12; BH) dS dx &frac14; &frac12; (B dS) (H dx). In general, integration of (BdS) results in
a flux, whereas integration of (Hdx) results in a magnetomotive force Ni, that is, in
</p>
<p>electrical current (ampere-turns). Therefore, the formula for the field energy
</p>
<p>contains members of the form Fi or Li2.

<p>For the considered system of N windings coupled in a magnetic field, it is required

<p>Equation 6.15 contains first time derivatives of the current i and inductance L.
</p>
<p>Variations in the matrix occur due to the relative motion of the rotor with respect to
</p>
<p>the stator. This motion leads to variation of mutual inductance between the rotor
</p>
<p>and stator windings. In certain conditions, rotor movement may cause variation of
</p>
<p>self-inductances of individual windings. Derivative of the current vector i in (6.15)
</p>
<p>is a vector whose elements are derivatives of the currents of individual windings.
</p>
<p>In cases where a winding is connected to an ideal current source which provides
</p>
<p>constant current, derivative of the winding current is zero. Derivative of a winding

<p>current can take nonzero values if the winding is short-circuited, or connected to an

<p>The part pwm of the power pe determines the increase in energyWm accumulated

<p>What remains of the source power is pe &ndash; pCu &ndash; pwm &frac14; pc. The remaining power pc
is converted to mechanical through electromagnetic processes involving

<p>chanical conversion or conversion power. In the motor mode (Fig. 5.8), reference

<p>6.9 Torque Expression
</p>
<p>Rotating electrical machine consists of a still stator and a moving rotor, both of
</p>
<p>cylindrical shapes having a common axis. The rotor is rotating relative to the stator
</p>
<p>with speed Om, and its position with respect to the stator is determined by angle ym
at each instant. Electrical machine has Nwindings, and some of them are positioned
</p>
<p>on the stator while the remaining ones are on the rotor. Since self-inductances and
</p>
<p>mutual inductances depend on relative position between the stator and the rotor,
</p>
<p>elements of the inductance matrix L are also functions of the same angle.
</p>
<p>Speed of rotation is
</p>
<p>Om &frac14;
dym
</p>
<p>dt
;
</p>
<p>and the inductance matrix can be represented by expression
</p>
<p>L &frac14; f 1&eth;t&THORN; &frac14; f 2&eth;ym&THORN;:
</p>
<p>The magnetic coupling field acts on both stator and rotor and creates electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic forces. Coupled forces create electromagnetic torque. Torque Tem acts
</p>
<p>upon rotor, while torque &ndash; Tem, of equal amplitude and opposite direction, acts upon
</p>
<p>stator. Since the stator is not mobile, it is only the rotor which can move. Torque Tem
is, via rotor and shaft, transferred to work machine or driving turbine.
</p>
<p>In motor mode, torque acts in the direction of movement. It tempts to increase
</p>
<p>the speed of rotation Om. Therefore, the power pC &frac14; TemOm is positive. The torque
Tem acts in the direction of motion. It is transferred to a work machine via shaft, and
</p>
<p>it tends to start up or to accelerate its movement.
</p>
<p>In generator mode, torque Tem is acting in the direction opposite to the move-
</p>
<p>ment; thus, the power pC &frac14; TemOm is negative. Negative value of the power of
electromechanical conversion indicates that the direction of conversion is changed,
</p>
<p>that is, mechanical work of the driving turbine is converted to electrical energy.
</p>
<p>Acting in the direction opposite to the movement, the torque Tem is, via shaft,
</p>
<p>transferred to the driving turbine and resists its rotation, tending to lower the speed
</p>
<p>of rotation.
</p>
<p>6.9 Torque Expression 117</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It is of interest to determine the expression for the electromagnetic torque. Since
</p>
<p>the power is equal to the product of the torque and speed, the conversion power of

<p>windings connected to ideal current sources. The winding currents are determined
</p>
<p>by the source currents and therefore constant. On the basis of (5.6), which applies in
</p>
<p>cases where magnetic field exists in linear medium, work of the source is evenly
</p>
<p>distributed between the mechanical work and the increase of the field energy; thus,

<p>ideal current sources. Therefore, the current intensities are constant. For this reason,
</p>
<p>the inductance matrix is the only factor in the above expression that may change as
</p>
<p>a function of angle ym. Therefore, the torque expression takes the form

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Question (6.3): Determine the course of change of the mutual inductance between
two windings, one of them being on the stator and the other on the rotor.
</p>
<p>Answer (6.3): Since the rotor revolves, angle ym between the stator and rotor
reference axes varies. Without the lack of generality, it can be assumed that the case
</p>
<p>ym &frac14; 0 corresponds to the rotor position where the magnetic axes of the two
windings are collinear. In such case, the lines of the magnetic field created by the
</p>
<p>stator winding are perpendicular to the surface delineated by the turns of the rotor
</p>
<p>winding. The part of the stator flux passing through rotor winding is at a maximum.
</p>
<p>Mutual inductance between the two windings is the highest for ym &frac14; 0. When the
rotor moves, angle between the field lines and the rotor surface is no longer p/2 but
</p>
<p>takes value of p/2�ym. Since the flux is determined by the sine of this angle,
variation of the mutual inductance is determined by function cos ym. Therefore,
</p>
<p>LSR &frac14; Lm cos ym.
Question (6.4): Give an example of a cylindrical machine with one of the stator
windings having the self-inductance that varies with the rotor position.
</p>
<p>Answer (6.4): Self-inductance of stator winding depends on the number of turns
and magnetic resistance. Resistance of the magnetic circuit consists of the resistance
</p>
<p>of the iron core of the stator, resistance of the magnetic circuit of the rotor, and
</p>
<p>magnetic resistance of the air gap, where flux from the stator magnetic circuit passes
</p>
<p>to the rotor magnetic circuit and vice versa. Magnetic circuit of the rotor is mainly
</p>
<p>cylindrical, and has a circular cross section. By removing some iron on the rotor
</p>
<p>sides, the cross section becomes elongated and resembles an ellipse. The elliptical
</p>
<p>rotor and cylindrical stator produce a variable air gap. Therefore, the flux extending
</p>
<p>along the larger rotor diameter will encounter magnetic resistancemuch smaller than
</p>
<p>the flux oriented along the shorter diameter of the elliptical rotor. For this reason, the
</p>
<p>stator fluxmeets a variablemagnetic resistance as the rotor revolves. In turn, the self-
</p>
<p>inductance LS &frac14; NS2/Rm is variable as well.
</p>
<p>6.10 Mechanical Subsystem
</p>
<p>Moving parts of a rotating electrical machine are magnetic and current circuits of
</p>
<p>the rotor, shaft, and bearings. Bearings are usually mounted on both shaft ends.
</p>
<p>They hold the rotor shaft firm and collinear with the axis of the stator cylinder.
</p>
<p>There are electrical machines having special fans built in the rotor for the purpose
</p>
<p>of enhancing the air flow and facilitate the cooling (self-cooling machines).
</p>
<p>In addition, rotor often has built-in sensors for performing measurements of the
</p>
<p>speed of rotation, position, and temperature of the rotor. In some cases, rotor may
</p>
<p>contain permanent magnets or semiconductor diodes. When modeling mechanical
</p>
<p>subsystem of an electrical machine, these details are not taken into account, and the
</p>
<p>rotor is modeled as a homogeneous cylinder of known mass and dimensions. Owing
</p>
<p>to the action of electromagnetic forces, torque Tem acts upon the rotor. The rotor is
</p>
<p>6.10 Mechanical Subsystem 119</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>connected via shaft to a work machine or a driving turbine. The shaft transfers the
</p>
<p>mechanical torque Tem.
</p>
<p>In the mechanical subsystem, there are losses due to friction and ventilation.
</p>
<p>A certain amount of energy is accumulated as kinetic energy in the rotating parts of
</p>
<p>the machine. For this reason, mechanical torque Tm existing at the shaft output is not
</p>
<p>equal to the electromagnetic torque Tem acting on the rotor. The power of electro-
</p>
<p>mechanical conversion pc is divided into the losses of mechanical subsystem,
</p>
<p>accumulation, and output power pm &frac14; TmOm, as shown in Fig. 6.5.
</p>
<p>6.11 Losses in Mechanical Subsystem
</p>
<p>Losses in mechanical subsystem consist of the energy required to overcome the
</p>
<p>resistance due to air friction experienced by the rotor and to overcome the friction in
</p>
<p>bearings, as well as the motion resistances of other nature and of secondary
</p>
<p>importance. Power losses in mechanical subsystem vary as a function of speed
</p>
<p>(Fig. 6.5). This variation may be a complex function of speed. Since the losses in
</p>
<p>mechanical subsystem are usually small, it is not of interest to introduce a complex
</p>
<p>model, but most often, the assumption is introduced that the friction torque is
</p>
<p>proportional to the speed and can be modeled by expression kFOm, resulting in
</p>
<p>the expression for power losses in the mechanical subsystem
</p>
<p>pgm &frac14; kFO2m: (6.20)
</p>
<p>This model of losses appears in a number of books and articles dealing with
</p>
<p>electrical machines. There are, however, electrical machines and applications
</p>
<p>where this model of losses in the mechanical subsystem is inadequate.
</p>
<p>Model of the losses in a mechanical subsystem, shown in Fig. 6.5, has been
</p>
<p>developed at the time when majority of electrical machines were mainly DC
</p>
<p>machines, which will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent chapters. Stator

<p>Accumulation of energy in the rotating masses is dependent on rotor inertia J. Rotor
</p>
<p>can be represented as a homogeneous cylinder of uniform specific mass in all its
</p>
<p>parts. With radius R and mass m, resulting moment of inertia is J &frac14; &frac12;mR2. Kinetic
energy Wk of a rotor with moment of inertia J and speed Om is Wk &frac14; &frac12; JOm2.
In order to increase kinetic energy, it is necessary to supply the power d(Wk)/
</p>
<p>dt &frac14; JOm dOm/dt. Therefore, increasing the speed of rotation involves adding an
amount of energy into revolving masses, while in order to slow down a speed
</p>
<p>of rotation, the energy should be taken away (by supplying a negative power).
</p>
<p>2Losses pFe in the magnetic field of the rotor of DC machines pFe belong to the losses in magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit, that is, to iron losses. Nevertheless, the motion resistance torque TFe arises due to losses
</p>
<p>pFe. It is of interest to emphasize that in AC machines having permanent magnets, motion
</p>
<p>resistance TFe also appears even in cases with no electric current in the windings. Motion
</p>
<p>resistance TFe does not belong to mechanical losses, since it is not caused by friction in the
</p>
<p>bearings nor friction with the air, but it is a specific electrical friction. There is, therefore, dilemma
</p>
<p>whether power pFe should be classified as motion resistance losses or losses in the magnetic field.
</p>
<p>If all the losses that oppose to motion and diminish the speed are classified as motion resistance
</p>
<p>losses, whether their cause is mechanical friction or not, then losses in the rotor magnetic circuit of
</p>
<p>DCmachines should be classified as motion resistance losses as well. Similar dilemma arises in the
</p>
<p>classification of the stator iron losses of synchronous machines having permanent magnets in their
</p>
<p>rotors.

<p>As a consequence of this, the torque Tm obtained at the shaft of the machine is
</p>
<p>smaller than electromagnetic torque Tem during acceleration intervals because one
</p>
<p>part of power pC and one part of the torque Tem &frac14; pC/Om are used to increase
kinetic energy of revolving masses. For the same reason, the torque Tm might

<p>In motor mode, the electrical machine acts on the work machine by the torque Tm
in order to support its motion. At the same time, the work machine reacts by the

<p>when electromagnetic torque prevails (Tem &gt; Tm &thorn; kFOm), the speed Om increases.
If Tem &lt; Tm &thorn; kFOm, the speed decreases. In steady state, electromagnetic torque

<p>In the case of the generator mode, when mechanical work is converted to electrical

<p>the torque Tm tends to support the motion. In such cases, torque Tm is obtained from

<p>The four above expressions define general model of a rotational electromechan-

</p>
<p>the four previously mentioned approximations. Among the approximations are the
</p>
<p>assumptions that ferromagnetic materials are linear and that iron losses are
</p>
<p>negligible.
</p>
<p>The inductance matrix is a nonstationary matrix. In general, elements of the
</p>
<p>matrix may be functions of the angle, time, as well as of the flux and current, which
</p>
<p>could change the self-inductances and mutual inductances due to nonlinearities in
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic materials and due to magnetic saturation. Within the following
</p>
<p>considerations, it is considered that the ferromagnetic material is linear and that
</p>
<p>126 6 Modeling Electrical Machines</p>
<p/>

<p>the inductance matrix and its elements are dependent only on the angle ym. This
</p>
<p>approximation is justified in the majority of cases and will not present an obstacle
</p>
<p>in understanding the operation of electrical machines and deriving their
</p>
<p>characteristics.
</p>
<p>It should be noted in 6.27 that the electromechanical conversion can be accom-
</p>
<p>plished only in cases where at least one element of the inductance matrix changes
</p>
<p>with the angle ym, either self-inductance of a winding or mutual inductance between
</p>
<p>two windings.
</p>
<p>In cases where an electrical machine has N windings, expression (6.25) contains
</p>
<p>N differential equations of voltage balance, expression (6.26) gives relation
</p>
<p>between the winding currents and corresponding fluxes, expression (6.27) gives
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque, and expression (6.28) is Newton differential equation
</p>
<p>defining the speed change. Therefore, the model contains N &thorn; 1 differential
equations and the same number of state variables.

<p>Single-Fed and Double-Fed Converters
</p>
<p>In this chapter, examples of single-fed and double electromechanical converters are
</p>
<p>analyzed and explained. In both cases, the torque changes are analyzed in cases
</p>
<p>where the windings have DC currents and AC currents of adjustable frequency.
</p>
<p>Revolving magnetic field created by AC currents in the windings is introduced and
</p>
<p>explained. Using the previous considerations, some basic operating principles are
</p>
<p>given for DC current machines, induction machines, and synchronous machines.
</p>
<p>Electrical machines where one or more self-inductances Lkk vary as a function of
</p>
<p>angle ym are usually called single-side supplied converters or single-fed machines.
</p>
<p>It is shown later that these machines may operate and perform electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversion in conditions where only the stator windings are fed from electrical
</p>
<p>source. It is also possible to envisage a single-fed electrical machine where only
</p>
<p>rotor windings are connected to the source, but this is rarely the case. There exist
</p>
<p>single-fed electrical machines having windings on the stator only, while the rotor
</p>
<p>contains no windings and has magnetic circuit with magnetic resistance which
</p>
<p>depends on the flux direction.
</p>
<p>Machines where one or more mutual inductances Lij change with angle ym
are called double-side supplied converters or double-fed machines. They have
</p>
<p>windings on both stator and rotor. Exception to this rule is synchronous machines
</p>
<p>with permanent magnets on the rotor and DC machines with permanent magnets
</p>
<p>on the stator, which will be considered later. The effect of permanent magnets on
</p>
<p>building the flux is equivalent to effects of windings with direct current mounted
</p>
<p>instead of magnets. Therefore, electrical machines with stator windings fed from
</p>
<p>electrical source and with permanent magnet on the rotor are classified as double-
</p>
<p>fed machines. The same holds for permanent magnet DC machines.
</p>
<p>In most cases, the windings of double-fed machine are fed from two different
</p>
<p>electrical sources; thus, there are electrical sources for the stator and the rotor. This
</p>
<p>two-sided power supply is the reason to call this type of machines double-fed
</p>
<p>machines.

<p>There are machines whose classification as single- or double-fed is not immediate.
</p>
<p>An example is induction machine, which is considered later in this book. Induction
</p>
<p>machine has windings on both stator and rotor. Neglecting the secondary and
</p>
<p>parasitic effects, it can be stated that self-inductances of the stator and rotor windings
</p>
<p>of an induction motor are constant, while mutual inductances vary as functions of
</p>
<p>angle, which may be the basis for classifying induction machines as double-fed
</p>
<p>machines. Nevertheless, only stator of an induction motor is fed from electrical
</p>
<p>sources, while rotor winding is short-circuited (squirrel cage), and it is not connected
</p>
<p>to any source. Since an induction motor is fed from the stator side only, it cannot be
</p>
<p>classified as double-fed machine. On the other hand, there exist induction machines
</p>
<p>with rotor winding which is separately fed, and these machines truly belong to
</p>
<p>double-fed machines. Similar dilemma appears when classifying synchronous
</p>
<p>machine to single-fed or double-fed group. Synchronous machine with permanent
</p>
<p>magnet on the rotor does not have any rotor windings. Therefore, it is difficult to
</p>
<p>determine a variable mutual inductance between the stator and rotor winding, as the
</p>
<p>rotor does not have any windings. On the other hand, a permanent magnet can be
</p>
<p>represented by a sheet of electrical currents or by a winding with direct current
</p>
<p>excitation. Thus, there is a basis for classifying permanent magnet synchronous
</p>
<p>machines as double-fed machines (Fig. 7.1).

<p>7.1 Analysis of Single-Fed Converter
</p>
<p>Figure 7.2 shows an elementary single-fed machine. The stator winding has N1
turns with equivalent resistance R1, fed from a current source i(t). Depending on
</p>
<p>variations of the flux and current, there is a voltage u1(t) across terminals of the
</p>
<p>winding. Magnetic circuit consists of the immobile stator part with magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance that is constant. It is considered that induction B1 in the stator is
</p>
<p>homogeneous on the magnetic circuit cross-section. Therefore, the flux F1 in one
</p>
<p>turn can be determined as B1S1, where S1 is the cross-section area of the stator.
</p>
<p>Rotor is revolving and its angular displacement from horizontal position is
</p>
<p>denoted by ym. Magnetic circuit of the rotor is made in such way that the magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance is dependent upon direction of the flux. The rotor is not cylindrical.
</p>
<p>Instead, it has salient poles. In the case when the rotor is in horizontal position, the
</p>
<p>stator flux passes through a relatively large air gap of very low permeability
</p>
<p>(denoted by A in Fig. 7.2). After passing through the air, the flux arrives in the
</p>
<p>rotor magnetic circuit which is made of high-permeability ferromagnetic material.
</p>
<p>Then, the flux leaves the rotor magnetic circuit (denoted by B in Fig. 7.2), passing
</p>
<p>again through the air and entering the stator magnetic circuit. The resulting resis-
</p>
<p>tance of the magnetic circuit is then relatively high. For vertically positioned rotor,
</p>
<p>resulting magnetic resistance is much lower. The field lines pass through a very
</p>
<p>small air gap, and the magnetic resistance is relatively low. Self-inductance of the
</p>
<p>stator winding is L1 &frac14; N12/Rm, where Rm denotes magnetic resistance across
the path of the stator flux. Since the magnetic resistance varies as function of
</p>
<p>angle, the self-inductance is also variable, fulfilling the requirements of electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical conversion.
</p>
<p>For the considered machine, the magnetic resistance is variable. Magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance is also called reluctance. For this reason, this type of machine is called
</p>
<p>reluctant machine, and the torque developed in this machine is called reluctant
</p>
<p>torque.

<p>7.2 Variation of Self-inductance
</p>
<p>Figure 7.2 shows single-fed converter with variable magnetic resistance. This
</p>
<p>converter has only one winding; thus, the inductance matrix has only one element,
</p>
<p>self-inductance of the stator winding L1(ym). Modeling the process of conversion
</p>
<p>requires the following function to be known:
</p>
<p>L1 ym&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
N21
</p>
<p>Rm ym&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>Magnetic resistance Rm is the ratio of the magnetomotive force F1 &frac14; N1i1 and
the flux in a single turn F1 &frac14; B1S1. Flux of the stator winding is C1 &frac14; N1F1.
In accordance with the adopted notation, flux of the core is also flux through the
</p>
<p>contour representing one turn, and it is denoted by F. On the other hand, winding
</p>
<p>flux is denoted by C. In a magnetic circuit of cross-section SFe having an air gap d
</p>
<p>and iron core where the intensity H of magnetic field is rather small, magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance is Rm &frac14; d/(m0 SFe).
Magnetic resistance Rm(ym) of the converter given in Fig. 7.2 has its minimum
</p>
<p>when the rotor is in vertical position. This occurs in the case when ym &frac14; p/2 or
ym &frac14; 3p/2. The magnetic resistance is at its maximum when the rotor is in horizon-
tal position. These are the cases with ym &frac14; 0 or ym &frac14; p, as shown in Fig. 7.3. During
the rotor revolution, magnetic circuit in Fig. 7.3 changes in a way that can be
</p>
<p>modeled assuming that the air gap is variable. It can be concluded that function
</p>
<p>Rm(ym) is periodic with the period of p. For this reason, function L1(ym) is also
</p>
<p>periodic and it has the same period. Actual variation of the self-inductance is
</p>
<p>dependent on the shape of the stator and rotor magnetic circuits.
</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the analysis and get to conclusions, function L1(ym) is
</p>
<p>approximated by the following trigonometric function:
</p>
<p>L1 ym&eth; &THORN; � Lmin &thorn;
Lmax � Lmin

minima and two maxima. Function L1(ym) can be represented in the form given

<p>7.3 The Expressions for Power and Torque
</p>
<p>It is of interest to determine the electromagnetic torque and power of electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical conversion of the single-fed converter presented in Fig. 7.2. In the case
</p>
<p>when the stator winding is connected to a current source i1(t), the energy
</p>
<p>accumulated in the magnetic coupling field is
</p>
<p>Wm &frac14;

L1&eth;ym&THORN; � i21:
</p>
<p>Since the winding is connected to the current source, the torque can be deter-
</p>
<p>mined as the first derivative of the field energy Wm. By using expression (7.1) for
</p>
<p>self-inductance L1(ym), the electromagnetic torque is determined by (7.2):

<p>Question (7.1): In the case when current i1 is constant, prove that in cases with the
rotor stopped at position ym &frac14; p/2, the rotor stays in stable equilibrium, while at
position ym &frac14; 0, the rotor is in unstable equilibrium.
Answer (7.1): Electromagnetic torque given by (7.2) is proportional to sin(2ym).
If the rotor is stopped at position ym &frac14; p/2, electromagnetic torque is equal to zero.
A hypothetically small displacement Dy in positive direction places the rotor in a
</p>
<p>new position where 2ym &frac14; p + 2Dy, where sin(2ym) &lt; 0. A negative torque arises,
tending to drive the rotor back to the previous position. In the case when the rotor
</p>
<p>makes a small move Dy to negative direction, a positive torque arises, tending to
</p>
<p>return the rotor to the previous position. In the case when the rotor is stopped at
</p>
<p>position ym &frac14; 0, the equilibrium is unstable. A hypothetically small movement Dy
in positive direction leads to creation of a positive torque, proportional to factor sin
</p>
<p>(Dym). Positive torque tends to increase the initial displacement and drive the rotor
</p>
<p>away from the initial position. The deviation is also cumulatively increased if a
</p>
<p>hypothetically small movement Dy is made in the negative direction.
</p>
<p>Question (7.2): Is it possible to accomplish a nonzero average value of the torque
using an alternating current of angular frequency os 6&frac14; Om?
Answer (7.2): On the basis of (7.4), nonzero average value of the torque can be
obtained also in the case when angular frequency of the current is os &frac14; �Om.

<p>7.4 Analysis of Double-Fed Converter
</p>
<p>A double-fed machine shown in Fig. 7.4 has windings on both moving and still
</p>
<p>parts. Stator has the magnetic circuit and winding with N1 turns having resistance
</p>
<p>R1. The current in the stator winding is i1(t), while the voltage u1(t) across terminals
</p>
<p>of the winding depends on variations of the flux and current. The rotor has
</p>
<p>cylindrical magnetic circuit and built-in rotor winding with resistance R2 and
</p>
<p>with electrical current i2(t). Depending on variations of the flux and rotor current,
</p>
<p>the voltage across terminals of the rotor winding is u2(t). Electromagnetic coupling
</p>
<p>between the stator and rotor is accomplished by variable mutual inductance.
</p>
<p>One part of the field lines representing the flux in the stator winding passes
</p>
<p>through magnetic circuit of the rotor and through rotor winding, and this part is
</p>
<p>7.4 Analysis of Double-Fed Converter 135</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>called mutual flux. Since the rotor is cylindrical, it gives the same magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance in all directions. It is therefore called isotropic. The air gap is constant;
</p>
<p>thus, rotation of the rotor does not cause any variation of magnetic resistance along
</p>
<p>the stator flux path. Therefore, the self-inductance of the stator winding is constant.
</p>
<p>For the particular form of the stator magnetic circuit shown in Fig. 7.4, it appears
</p>
<p>that the rotor self-inductance L2 would change in the course of rotor revolution. The
</p>
<p>variation of self-inductance is not the key property of double-fed converters.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the variation of L2 will be briefly explained for clarity. Direction of
</p>
<p>the rotor flux is determined by the position of the magnetic axis of the rotor
</p>
<p>winding, that is, by the angle ym. This angle determines the displacement between
</p>
<p>the rotor magnetic axis and the horizontal axis. As the rotor turns, the rotor flux is
</p>
<p>facing magnetic resistance which is dependent on the rotor position ym. Namely, for
</p>
<p>ym &frac14; p/2, the rotor flux is passing through a relatively small air gap and it enters the
magnetic circuit of the stator. When ym &frac14; 0, the rotor flux passes from the rotor
magnetic circuit into the surrounding airspace with permeability and high magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance. With ym &frac14; p/2, the path of the rotor flux through the air is shorter
compared to the rotor flux path through the air for ym &frac14; 0. Therefore, the magnetic
resistance and self-inductance of the rotor are both dependent on position ym.
</p>
<p>Variation of L2 is dependent upon the shape of magnetic circuit. Assuming that
</p>
<p>stator magnetic circuit is modified in such way that it firmly embraces the rotor
</p>
<p>cylinder, variation of inductance L2 would be smaller. In cases where both stator
</p>
<p>and rotor magnetic circuits are cylindrical (see Fig. 5.10.), the rotor self-inductance
</p>
<p>L2 remains constant and does not depend on the rotor position.
</p>
<p>In the subsequent analysis of the operation of a double-fed converter, variation
</p>
<p>of the rotor self-inductance as function of the shift ym is neglected, and it is assumed
</p>
<p>that L2 &frac14; const.

<p>7.5 Variation of Mutual Inductance
</p>
<p>Mutual inductance between the stator and rotor windings is dependent on the rotor
</p>
<p>position ym. When the rotor is in position where the rotor magnetic axis is horizon-
</p>
<p>tal, magnetic axes of stator and rotor windings are perpendicular. The lines of the
</p>
<p>stator flux do not affect the flux through the rotor turns, nor do the lines of the rotor
</p>
<p>flux contribute to the flux in the stator turns. Therefore, with the rotor axis in
</p>
<p>horizontal position, the mutual inductance L12 is equal to zero. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>in positions ym &frac14; p/2 and ym &frac14; 3p/2, magnetic coupling between the windings is
strong, magnetic axes of the two windings reside on the same line, and mutual
</p>
<p>inductance L12 reaches its maximum absolute value Lm. The sign of the mutual
</p>
<p>inductance depends on relative position between magnetic axes of the two
</p>
<p>windings. Physically, the question is whether the fluxes add or subtract. When
</p>
<p>magnetic axes are oriented in the same direction, a positive current in one winding
</p>
<p>tends to increase the flux in the other winding. Therefore, the mutual inductance is
</p>
<p>positive. In cases where magnetic axes of stator and rotor are in opposite directions,
</p>
<p>a positive current in one winding tends to decrease the flux in the other winding and
</p>
<p>the mutual inductance is negative. Variation of the mutual inductance with the rotor
</p>
<p>angle ym depends on the shape of magnetic circuit and also on the distribution of
</p>
<p>conductors making up the windings. In majority of cases, this inductance can be
</p>
<p>approximated by
</p>
<p>L12&eth;ym&THORN; &frac14; Lm sin ym:
</p>
<p>The inductance matrix expresses the total flux of the stator C1 and total flux of
</p>
<p>the rotor C2 in terms of the winding currents i1 and i2. Self-inductances L11 &frac14; L1
and L22 &frac14; L2 are positioned along the main diagonal of the matrix, while the
remaining matrix elements are equal to the mutual inductance between the two
</p>
<p>windings L12 &frac14; L21 &frac14; Lm sin ym, as illustrated in Fig. 7.5.

<p>expression which comprises the factor C1C2. On the other hand, since C1 &frac14; N1F1

<p>C1C2, or to the product of the fluxes in one stator and rotor turn, F1F2.
</p>
<p>7.6.1 Average Torque
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic torque in a double-fed machine is given in (7.8). When the rotor
</p>
<p>revolves at a constant angular speed Om, position of the rotor is ym &frac14; Omt + y0.
It can be assumed that at the instant t &frac14; 0, angle ym(0) &frac14; y0 gets equal to zero; thus,
position of the rotor is ym &frac14; Omt. If electrical currents in the windings are constant
(i1 &frac14; I1 i2 &frac14; I2), it can be concluded that the torque will changed according to cos
Omt, with the average value equal to zero. Therefore, a double-fed machine with
</p>
<p>constant (DC) currents in the stator and rotor windings produces electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque with average value equal to zero. Therefore, the average value of the
</p>
<p>conversion power is equal to zero as well. If one of the currents is variable, it is
</p>
<p>possible to synchronize its changes with the rotor revolution and obtain a nonzero
</p>
<p>average torque and power.
</p>
<p>Question (7.3): Assuming that the current of the other winding is constant,
i2 &frac14; I2, and that ym &frac14; Omt, determine the variation of current i1 which will give
the torque with nonzero average value.
</p>
<p>Answer (7.3): According to expression (7.8), the electromagnetic torque is deter-
mined by the product of functions cosOmt and i1(t). Product i1(t) cos Omt can have a
</p>
<p>nonzero average if i1 is an alternating current with the o1 equal to the rotor angular
</p>
<p>speed Om.
</p>
<p>7.6.2 Conditions for Generating Nonzero Torque
</p>
<p>The subsequent analysis proves that the electromagnetic torque of a double-fed
</p>
<p>machine with alternating currents in the stator and rotor windings may assume a
</p>
<p>nonzero average value, provided that the frequencies of currents and the rotor speed
</p>
<p>7.6 Torque Expression 139</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>meet certain conditions. The currents can be expressed in terms of their amplitude I,
</p>
<p>angular frequency o, and initial phase, i &frac14; I cos(ot�&rsquo;). When both the stator and
rotor currents have nonzero angular frequencies, they change periodically, as well
</p>
<p>as the stator and rotor fluxes. It is also possible to distinguish the case where one of
</p>
<p>the currents has its angular frequency equal to zero, o &frac14; 0. This actually means
that such current does not change, maintaining the value of i &frac14; I cos(&rsquo;). As a
matter of fact, o &frac14; 0 results in a DC current. The currents of the stator and rotor
may have different amplitudes, frequencies, and initial phases. Let the angular
</p>
<p>frequency of the stator current be o1, the angular frequency of the rotor current
</p>
<p>o2, the relevant amplitudes I1m and I2m, and the initial phases �&rsquo;1 and �&rsquo;2.
Instantaneous values of the winding currents are given by (7.9):
</p>
<p>i1 &frac14; I1m cos&eth;o1t� &rsquo;1&THORN;;
i2 &frac14; I2m cos&eth;o2t� &rsquo;2&THORN;: (7.9)
</p>
<p>By introducing these expressions into (7.8), one obtains the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque as
</p>
<p>Tem &frac14; i1i2Lm cos ym
&frac14; I1m cos&eth;o1t� &rsquo;1&THORN; � I2m cos&eth;o2t� &rsquo;2&THORN; � Lm cos ym :
</p>
<p>With ym &frac14; Omt, the torque Tem is a product of three periodic functions. By
introducing coefficient Kn &frac14; LmI1mI2m/4, this equation assumes the form
</p>
<p>Tem &frac14; Kn cos &eth;o1t� &rsquo;1 &thorn; o2t� &rsquo;2 &thorn; Omt&THORN;

&thorn; Kn cos&eth;o1t� &rsquo;1 � o2t&thorn; &rsquo;2 � Omt&THORN;: (7.10)
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic torque has the amplitude proportional to the mutual induc-
</p>
<p>tance and to the product of the amplitudes of thewinding currents (Lm I1m I2m &frac14; 4Kn).
Variation of the torque is determined by four cosine functions having different
</p>
<p>frequencies. Their frequencies can be expressed byo1 � o2 � Om. For the function
cos(ot�&rsquo;) to assume a nonzero average value, it is necessary that the angular
frequency o is equal to zero. Hence, for the expression (7.10) to have a nonzero
</p>
<p>average value, one of frequencieso1 � o2 � Om has to be equal to zero. Therefore,
conclusion is reached that a nonzero average value of the torque Tem is obtained in
</p>
<p>cases where the angular frequencies (o1 ando2) of electrical currents in the windings

<p>and the rotor speed Om meet one out of four conditions given in expression (7.11):

<p>7.7 Magnetic Poles
</p>
<p>Double-fed electrical machine has magnetic circuit where it is possible to observe
</p>
<p>two magnetic poles of the stator and two magnetic poles of the rotor. Position of the
</p>
<p>north magnetic pole of the rotor can be determined as a zone where the lines of
</p>
<p>magnetic field, created by electrical currents in the rotor windings, come out of the
</p>
<p>rotor magnetic circuit and enter the air gap. Similarly, one can define the south
</p>
<p>magnetic pole of the rotor, as well as the magnetic poles of the stator. Double-fed
</p>
<p>machine under the scope has two stator poles and two rotor poles. Since L12 &frac14; Lm
sinym, it can be concluded that one cycle of variation of the mutual inductance
</p>
<p>corresponds to one full mechanical rotation of the rotor.
</p>
<p>In due course, multipole machines will be defined and explained. The matter
</p>
<p>concerns electrical machines made to have more than one pair of magnetic poles.
</p>
<p>In most cases, the number of poles on the stator is equal to the number of rotor
</p>
<p>poles. A four pole machine has two north and two south poles on the stator and the
</p>
<p>same number of poles on the rotor. Such machine is said to have p &frac14; 2 pairs of
poles. In a four pole double-fed machine, mutual inductance varies as L12 &frac14; Lm sin
(pym) &frac14; Lm sin(2ym), thus making two cycles during one revolution of the rotor.
A nonzero average value of the torque is obtained in the case when � o1 � o2 �
pOm &frac14; 0, where Om denotes the mechanical angular frequency of the rotor motion.
</p>
<p>In this book, letter o denotes the angular frequencies of voltages and currents,
</p>
<p>while letter Om denotes the speed of rotor motion, also called mechanical angular
</p>
<p>speed. The former is often referred to as the electrical frequency o, while the later
</p>
<p>is called mechanical speed O. Therefrom, mechanical speed Om may have its
</p>
<p>electrical counterpart om &frac14; pOm.
Later on, revolving vectors are defined representing the spatial distribution of the
</p>
<p>magnetic induction B, magnetic field H, but also the voltages and currents in

<p>The expressions electrical frequency o and mechanical speed O will be better
</p>
<p>defined in the course of presentation, as well as the relation o &frac14; pO. For the time

<p>7.8 Direct Current and Alternating Current Machines
</p>
<p>The analysis of double-fed machines can be used for demonstration of the basic
</p>
<p>operating principles of DC machines, induction machines, and synchronous
</p>
<p>machines. The latter two are also called AC machines. These machines will be
</p>
<p>studied in the remaining part of the book. All three types of machines have windings
</p>
<p>on both stator and rotor. Rotation of the rotor changes mutual inductance between
</p>
<p>the stator and rotor windings.

<p>It has been shown that development of electromagnetic torque with nonzero
</p>
<p>average value requires the electrical stator frequency o1, electrical rotor frequency
</p>
<p>o2, and the rotor speed Om
1 to meet the condition o1 � o2 � om &frac14; 0.
</p>
<p>DCmachines have a DC current in the stator windings (o1 &frac14; 0), while in the rotor
windings they have an AC current. The angular frequency of the rotor currents is
</p>
<p>determined by the speed of rotation, o2 &frac14; pOm2.
Induction machines have alternating currents in stator windings and alternating
currents in rotor windings. According to (7.11), the sum of pOm
</p>
<p>3 and rotor fre-
</p>
<p>quency o2 has to be equal to the stator frequency o1. Therefore, pOm &frac14; o1�o2.
The rotor mechanical speed Om lags behind o1/p by o2/p. The rotor frequency
</p>
<p>o2 &frac14; o1�pOm of induction machines is also called slip frequency, as it defines the
slip of the rotor speed behind the value of o1/p, determined by the stator frequency
</p>
<p>and called synchronous speed.
</p>
<p>Synchronous machines have alternating currents in stator windings, while the rotor
conductors carry DC current. Since o2 &frac14; 0, condition (7.11) reduces to o1 &frac14; pOm.
Therefore, the rotor speed Om is uniquely determined by the stator electrical fre-
</p>
<p>quency, Om &frac14; o1/p. Hence, all the two-pole (p &frac14; 1) synchronous machines
connected to the three-phase grid with the line frequency of fs &frac14; 50 Hz make 50
turns per second, or 50�60 &frac14; 3,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). A four pole (p &frac14; 2)
synchronous machine supplied by fs &frac14; 60 Hz runs at 60�60/p &frac14; 1,800 rpm. Hence,
thesemachines run synchronouslywith the supply frequency and therefore their name.

<p>7.9 Torque as a Vector Product
</p>
<p>The principles of operation of DC machines, induction, and synchronous machines
</p>
<p>as well as the main differences between them are more obvious when the stator and
</p>
<p>rotor fluxes are represented by corresponding vectors. Electromagnetic torque can
</p>
<p>1 In cases where machine has p pairs of poles, the condition for torque development is o1 � o2
� pOm &frac14; 0. Notation Om is angular speed of rotor motion, hence mechanical speed. Angular
frequency om &frac14; pOm is electrical representation of the rotor speed. It defines the period Tom &frac14; 2
p/om which marks passing of north magnetic poles of the rotor against north magnetic poles of the
</p>
<p>stator. With p &gt; 1, this happens more than once per each mechanical revolution. In a machine with
p &gt; 1 pole pairs, angular distance between the two neighboring north poles is OmTom &frac14; 2p/p.
A four pole machine (p &frac14; 2) has two north and two south poles. Two north poles are at angular
distance of OmTom &frac14; 2p/2 &frac14; p. Therefore, any north magnetic pole of the rotor passes against
stator north pole twice per turn. In a two-pole machine (p &frac14; 1), starting from the north magnetic
pole, one should pass angular distance of OmTom &frac14; 2p/1 &frac14; 2p in order to arrive at the next
north pole, the very same pole from where one started. Namely, a two-pole machine has only one
</p>
<p>north magnetic pole and one south magnetic pole.
2 In a two-pole DC machine, the number of pole pairs is p &frac14; 1. Therefore, o2 &frac14; pOm &frac14; Om. With
p &gt; 1, the condition reads o2 &frac14; om &frac14; pOm.
3 In a two-pole induction motor, p &frac14; 1.

</p>
<p>the torque is obtained by multiplying the amplitude of the stator flux vector, the
</p>
<p>amplitude of the rotor flux vector, and the sine of the angle between the two vectors.
</p>
<p>A proof of this statement will be presented later on for all the machines studied in
</p>
<p>this book. Moreover, the electromagnetic torque developed by an electrical
</p>
<p>machine can be determined by calculating the vector product of:

<p>&bull; The stator and rotor magnetomotive force vectors (current vectors)

<p>&bull; The stator flux vector and the rotor magnetomotive force vector (current vector)
</p>
<p>&bull; The rotor flux vector and the stator magnetomotive force vector (current vector)
</p>
<p>Obtaining electromagnetic torque as vector product of the flux and current can
</p>
<p>be demonstrated by taking the example of a contour placed in an external, homo-
</p>
<p>geneous magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 7.6. The contour is made of a conductor
</p>
<p>carrying electrical current I. The conductor is shaped in the form of a flat rectangle
</p>
<p>of width D and length L, encircling the surface S &frac14; DL. In the considered position,
angle between the normal n1 on the surface plane and vector of magnetic induction
</p>
<p>is a. Angle a determines the electromagnetic torque acting on the contour.
</p>
<p>Magnetic momentum of the contour is a vector collinear with the normal n1 on
</p>
<p>the surface S surrounded by the contour. The orientation of the normal is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the direction of electrical current in the contour and the right-hand rule.
</p>
<p>The amplitude of the magnetic momentum m is determined by the product of the
</p>
<p>contour current I and the surface S,
</p>
<p>~m &frac14; I � S �~n1 (7.12)
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic torque acting on the contour is equal to the vector product
</p>
<p>of the magnetic momentum m and the magnetic induction B. The torque can be
</p>
<p>determined from (7.13). In Fig. 7.6, the torque vector extends in the axis of rotation
</p>
<p>of the contour, and its direction is determined from the coupled forces by the right-

</p>
<p>Flux through the contour is a scalar quantity. By associating the course and
</p>
<p>direction of magnetic induction B to the flux F, it is possible to conceive the flux
</p>
<p>vector. Magnetomotive force of the contour is a vector whose orientation is
</p>
<p>determined by the normal n1, which is collinear with the vector of magnetic
</p>
<p>momentum of the contour. Therefore, the value of expression (7.14) is determined
</p>
<p>by the vector product of the magnetomotive force vector and the flux vector. In a
</p>
<p>like manner, it can be shown that the electromagnetic torque of a cylindrical
</p>
<p>rotating machine is determined by the vector product of the magnetomotive force
</p>
<p>of the stator and the rotor flux. By rearranging the expressions, it is possible to
</p>
<p>express the torque as the vector product of the stator and rotor fluxes. It is also
</p>
<p>possible to express the torque in terms of stator and rotor magnetomotive forces or
</p>
<p>in terms of the stator flux and the rotor magnetomotive force.
</p>
<p>7.10 Position of the Flux Vector in Rotating Machines
</p>
<p>The stator flux vector and the rotor flux vector of an electrical machine have the
</p>
<p>spatial orientation which depends on electrical currents they originate from. A DC
</p>
<p>current in stator windings creates stator flux which does not move relative to the
</p>
<p>stator. A DC current in rotor windings creates rotor flux which does not move with
</p>
<p>respect to the rotor. In cases where rotor turns, such rotor flux revolves with respect
</p>
<p>to the stator at the rotor speed. It will be shown later that a set of stator windings
</p>
<p>with AC currents may produce stator flux vector which revolves with respect to the
</p>
<p>stator at a speed determined by the angular frequency of AC currents. More detailed
</p>
<p>definition of the flux per turn, flux per winding, and the method of representing flux
</p>
<p>as a vector are given in Chap. 4.
</p>
<p>The analysis which shows that the electromagnetic torque of a machine can be
</p>
<p>determined from the vector product of fluxes and magnetomotive forces is a part of
</p>
<p>the chapters dealing with DC and AC machines. Induction, synchronous, and DC
</p>
<p>machines differ inasmuch as they have DC or AC currents in stator and rotor
</p>
<p>windings.
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic torque of DC and AC machines can be determined on the
</p>
<p>basis of the vector product between the stator and rotor flux vectors. Provided
</p>
<p>with the stator flux per turn (FS), rotor flux per turn (FR), and with the angle Dy
</p>
<p>between the stator and rotor flux vectors, the electromagnetic torque can be
</p>
<p>calculated from the expression |FS � FR |&frac14; FSFRsin(Dy).
In cases when relative position of the two flux vectors varies according to the law
</p>
<p>Dy &frac14; ot, the electromagnetic torque will, according to (7.13), exhibit oscillations

<p>and change as (sinot). Average value of such torque is equal to zero. In order to
</p>
<p>create an electromagnetic torque with nonzero average, it is necessary that relative
</p>
<p>position between the stator and rotor flux vectors does not change. A constant
</p>
<p>displacement Dy is obtained in cases where both flux vectors are stationary with
</p>
<p>respect to the stator but also in cases where the two vectors rotate at the same speed
</p>
<p>and in the same direction, keeping their relative displacement Dy constant.
</p>
<p>A constant displacement Dy cannot be achieved in electrical machines that have
</p>
<p>DC currents in both stator and rotor windings. Namely, windings carrying DC
</p>
<p>current create a magnetomotive force and flux along the winding axis. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the flux caused by DC currents cannot move relative to the winding. Therefore, DC
</p>
<p>currents in stator windings create a stationary stator flux. DC currents in rotor
</p>
<p>windings create a rotor flux that does not move with respect to the rotor. With the
</p>
<p>rotor in motion, the rotor flux revolves at the rotor speed, moving in such a way
</p>
<p>relative to the stator flux. In these conditions, the angle Dy changes while the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque oscillates and has the average value equal to zero.
</p>
<p>In the considered case, the flux vectors are shown in Fig. 7.7. Stator flux FS does
</p>
<p>not move, while rotor flux FR revolves at rotor speed Om. With yCS &frac14; 0, the angle
Dy between the two vectors is function of the speed of rotor rotation Dy &frac14; �Om�t,
while variation of the torque is determined by function sin(�Om�t); thus, its average
value is zero. In order to accomplish a constant value of the angle between stator
</p>
<p>and rotor fluxes, both vectors have to be still or moving at the same speed. In any
</p>
<p>case, one of the windings, stator or rotor, has to create a magnetic field that revolves
</p>
<p>with respect of the originating winding. Although the principles of operation of the
</p>
<p>DC machines and induction and synchronous machines are yet to be explained and
</p>
<p>analyzed in detail, it is of interest to indicate the position of the stator and rotor flux
</p>
<p>vectors in these machines.
</p>
<p>A DC machine is shown in the part A of Fig. 7.8. Stator flux is represented by
vector FS. Flux FS is immobile, created by DC currents in the stator windings.
</p>
<p>Rotor flux is represented by vector FR. Flux FR is created by alternating currents
</p>
<p>in the rotor conductors. Usually, rotor winding has a large number of turns, but in
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.8a, it is represented by conductors P1 and P2. In these conductors, there is an
</p>
<p>alternating current with angular frequency ofo2&frac14;Om. During one turn of the rotor,
currents in conductors P1 and P2 make one full cycle of their periodical change,
</p>
<p>being positive during one half period and negative during another half period.
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.7 Change of angular
displacement between stator
</p>
<p>and rotor flux vectors in the

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It is assumed that the rotor revolves at the speed Om. Since the current in rotor
</p>
<p>conductors changes sign synchronously with rotor revolutions, the current in
</p>
<p>rotor conductor passing by the south magnetic pole of the stator will always be
</p>
<p>directed toward the spectator (	). In Fig. 7.8a, the rotor is in position where the
conductor P1 passes under the south magnetic pole of the stator.
</p>
<p>The preceding statement can be supported by the following discussion.
</p>
<p>In position of the rotor shown in Fig. 7.8a, conductor P2 is below the north magnetic
</p>
<p>pole of the stator and carries the current directed away from the spectator (
).
Having passed one half of the rotor turn, conductor P2 comes in place of the
</p>
<p>conductor P1, below the south magnetic pole of the stator. At the same time,
</p>
<p>direction of rotor current changes. Hence, in conductor P2, direction (
) changes
into (	). Therefore, direction of the current in the rotor conductor below the south
magnetic pole of the stator remains toward the spectator. It can be shown in a like
</p>
<p>manner that the rotor conductor passing by the north stator pole keeps the direction
</p>
<p>away from the reader (
).
Distribution of rotor currents described above does not move with respect to the
</p>
<p>stator. Rotor currents create magnetomotive force and flux which are immobile with
</p>
<p>respect to the stator. What remains unclear at this point is the way of supplying the
</p>
<p>rotor winding with alternating currents having an angular frequency equal to
</p>
<p>the rotor speed. This will be explained in more detail in the chapter dealing with
</p>
<p>DC machines.
</p>
<p>Under considerations, the AC currents in rotor conductors create rotor flux
</p>
<p>vector FR which revolves with respect to the rotor itself. The magnetic field
</p>
<p>which rotates with respect to the originating windings is called rotating or revolving
</p>
<p>magnetic field. Conditions to be met for AC currents to create rotating magnetic
</p>
<p>field will be explained in more detail in the chapter dealing with induction
</p>
<p>machines.
</p>
<p>In the course of rotation of the rotor in Fig. 7.8a, the rotor flux vector is still with
</p>
<p>respect to the stator and orthogonal to the stator flux vector, regardless of the speed
</p>
<p>and direction of rotation. For this reason, rotor magnetic field in a DC machine can
</p>
<p>be called halted rotating field.

<p>Induction machines have AC currents of angular frequency o1 in stator
conductors. In rotor conductors, there are AC currents with different angular
</p>
<p>frequency (o2). A simplified representation of an induction machine having one
</p>
<p>pair of magnetic poles (p &frac14; 1) is shown in Fig. 7.8b. By the previous example of a
DC machine, it is shown that AC currents in rotor conductors create rotor magnetic
</p>
<p>field and rotor flux vector which rotate with respect to the rotor. The speed of
</p>
<p>rotation of the flux vector with respect to the originating winding is determined by
</p>
<p>the angular frequency of the winding currents.
</p>
<p>In a like manner, stator flux FS in an induction machine rotates at a speed
</p>
<p>O1 &frac14; o1 with respect to the stator, while rotor flux FR rotates at a speed O2 &frac14; o2
with respect to the rotor. Since the rotor revolves at the speed4 Om &frac14; om, the
speed of rotation of rotor flux is Om + o2. Vector of the stator flux rotates at
</p>
<p>the speed of o1; thus, the speed difference between stator flux vector and rotor
</p>
<p>flux vector is o1 � Om � o2. According to (7.11) which gives the condition for
delivering the power and torquewith nonzero average values, the sumo1�Om�o2
must be equal to zero.
</p>
<p>On the basis of previous considerations regarding the operation of induction
</p>
<p>machines, the following conclusions can be drawn:
</p>
<p>&bull; The stator and rotor flux vectors rotate at the same speed. The speed of rotation
</p>
<p>of the magnetic field in induction machine is O1, and it is determined by the
</p>
<p>angular frequency o1 of the stator currents. In a two-pole machine, this speed is
</p>
<p>O1 &frac14; o1.
&bull; Angle Dy between the stator and rotor flux vectors is constant in a steady state.
</p>
<p>Machine provides electromagnetic torque proportional to sin(Dy), and it is
</p>
<p>constant in a steady state.
</p>
<p>&bull; Rotor of a two-pole machine revolves at the speed which is different than the
</p>
<p>speed O1 &frac14; o1 of the magnetic field. The speed difference o2 &frac14; o1 � Om is
called slip. Slip of a two-pole induction machine (p &frac14; 1) is equal to the angular
frequency of the rotor currents (o2).
</p>
<p>Synchronous machines have AC currents of frequency o1 in the stator windings
and a DC current in the rotor windings.5 The stator flux vector FS of a two-pole
</p>
<p>(p &frac14; 1) machine rotates at the speed O1 &frac14; o1 with respect to the stator, while the
rotor flux vector FR rotates at the same speed as the rotor, Om &frac14; om. A simplified
representation of a two-pole synchronous machine is shown in Fig. 7.8c. Genera-
</p>
<p>tion of the electromagnetic torque with a nonzero average value requires that
</p>
<p>relative position of the two flux vectors does not change. In other words, the
</p>
<p>angle Dy has to remain constant. For this reason, the rotor speed and the speed of
</p>
<p>4Example in Fig. 7.8b considers a two-pole machine having p &frac14; 1 pair of magnetic poles. Due to
o &frac14; pO and p &frac14; 1, mechanical speed (angular frequency) O corresponds to electrical speed
(angular frequency) o.

<p>revolving stator flux vector have to be the same. Therefore, the stator and rotor flux
</p>
<p>vectors of a synchronous machine rotate synchronously with the rotor. In a two-pole
</p>
<p>synchronous machine, angular frequency of stator currents has to be equal to the
</p>
<p>rotor speed. In machines having several pole pairs (p &gt; 1), this condition takes the
form o1 &frac14; pOm.
</p>
<p>7.11 Rotating Field
</p>
<p>The analysis carried out in the preceding subsection shows that the condition for
</p>
<p>developing an electromagnetic torque with a nonzero average value is that relative
</p>
<p>position Dy between the stator and rotor flux vectors remains constant. In DC
</p>
<p>machines, both fluxes are still with respect to the stator, while in AC machines,
</p>
<p>induction and synchronous, the two fluxes revolve at the same speed.
</p>
<p>With the rotor revolving at a speed Om, the angle Dy can remain constant
</p>
<p>provided that at least one of the two fluxes (FS or FR) revolves with respect to
</p>
<p>the winding whose magnetomotive force originates the flux. The magnetic field
</p>
<p>which rotates with respect to the originating winding is called rotating magnetic
</p>
<p>field. It will be shown later that creation of a rotating field in induction and
</p>
<p>synchronous machines requires at least two separate windings on the stator, also
</p>
<p>called phases or phase windings. With two-phase windings on the stator, the spatial
</p>
<p>displacement between the winding axes has to be p/2. The alternating currents in
</p>
<p>two-phase windings have to be of the same amplitude and the same angular
</p>
<p>frequency. The difference of their initial phases has to be p/2, the same as the
</p>
<p>spatial displacement between the phase windings. In this case, stator currents result
</p>
<p>in a rotating magnetic field. The amplitude of the stator flux and its speed of rotation
</p>
<p>can be changed by varying the amplitude and frequency of the stator currents.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, an introductory example is given, illustrating the generation of a
</p>
<p>rotating field by the stator with two-phase windings.
</p>
<p>Figure 7.9 shows two stator windings with their magnetic axes spatially
</p>
<p>displaced by p/2. Axes of the windings are denoted by a and b. The winding in
</p>
<p>axis a has the same number of turns as the winding in axis b. Both windings carry

</p>
<p>but their initial phases differ by p/2. Each winding creates a magnetomotive force
</p>
<p>along its own axis. Magnetomotive force amplitude depends on the current and the
</p>
<p>number of turns. The winding flux is proportional to the magnetomotive force and
</p>
<p>inversely proportional to magnetic resistance. If magnetic circuits of the stator and
</p>

<p>does not depend on the flux spatial orientation. For this reason, the magnetic

<p>resistance to the flux Fa is equal to the magnetic resistance to the flux Fb. With

<p>the fluxes Fa and Fb are obtained by multiplying the number of turns N by

<p>7.12 Types of Electrical Machines
</p>
<p>7.12.1 Direct Current Machines
</p>
<p>Electrical machines where the stator winding carries a DC current, while the rotor
</p>
<p>winding carries AC currents, and where the stator flux vector and the rotor flux
</p>
<p>vector do not move with respect to the stator are calledDC current machines. Stator
</p>
<p>windings of DC machines are fed by DC, direct current. Rotor conductors in such
</p>
<p>machines carry AC currents with the frequency determined by the speed of rotation.
</p>
<p>The power source feeding a DC machine does not provide AC currents and
</p>
<p>voltages, but instead it gives DC currents and voltages. The method of directing
</p>
<p>DC current from the power source into the rotor conductors involves commutator,
</p>
<p>mechanical device explained further on. The action of commutator is such it
</p>
<p>receives DC source current and feeds the rotor winding with AC currents, the
</p>
<p>frequency of which is determined by the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>Induction and synchronous machines have AC currents in their stator windings.
</p>
<p>The angular frequency o1 of these currents provides a rotating magnetic field.
</p>
<p>Therefore, these machines belong to the group of AC machines. The speed of
</p>
<p>rotation of the magnetic field is determined by the angular frequency o1. It is
</p>
<p>shown by the analysis of the structure in Fig. 7.9 that a system of two orthogonal
</p>
<p>stator windings could create magnetic field that revolves at the speed determined by
</p>
<p>the angular frequency of AC currents. Practical AC machines usually have a system
</p>
<p>of stator windings consisting of three parts, three phases, that is, three-phase
</p>
<p>windings. Magnetic axes of three-phase windings are spatially shifted by 2p/3.
</p>
<p>The initial phases of AC currents carried by the windings should be displaced by
</p>
<p>2p/3 in order to provide rotating field. Amplitude Im of AC currents determines the
</p>
<p>algebraic intensity of the flux vector, while the angular frequency o1 &frac14; oS
determines the speed of rotation OS of the magnetic field.
</p>
<p>7.12.2 Induction Machines
</p>
<p>In addition to AC currents carried by the stator windings, induction machines
</p>
<p>also have AC currents in the rotor conductors. Magnetic field created by the
</p>
<p>stator currents rotates at the speed O1 &frac14; o1, while the rotor field revolves at the
speed O2 &frac14; o2 with respect to the rotor. The speeds of rotation of the stator and
rotor flux vectors have been discussed in the previous section, where it is shown
</p>
<p>that the angular frequency of rotor currents, also called the slip frequency,
</p>
<p>corresponds to the difference between the angular frequency of stator currents
</p>
<p>and the rotor speed.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.12.3 Synchronous Machines
</p>
<p>Like induction machines, synchronous machines have a system of stator windings
</p>
<p>with AC currents creating magnetic field which revolves at the speed determined
</p>
<p>by the angular frequency of stator currents. Currents of the rotor winding of a
</p>
<p>synchronous machine are constant. They are supplied from a separate DC current
</p>
<p>source. Rotor current creates the rotor flux which does not move with respect to the
</p>
<p>rotor. Therefore, the rotor flux rotates together with the rotor and has the same speed
</p>
<p>Om. There are synchronous machines which do not have the rotor winding. Instead,
</p>
<p>the rotor flux is obtained by placing permanent magnets within the rotor magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit. It has been shown before that the torque generation within an electrical
</p>
<p>machine requires the angle between the stator and rotor flux vectors to be constant.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the stator flux vector of a synchronous machine has to rotate at the same
</p>
<p>speed as the rotor. In other words, the stator flux has to move synchronously with
</p>
<p>the rotor.
</p>
<p>Among these machines, each type has its merits, limitations, and specific field of
</p>
<p>application.
</p>
<p>Further analysis of electrical machines requires some basic knowledge on the
</p>
<p>machine windings, skills in analyzing the magnetic field in the air gap, and
</p>
<p>understanding the principles of rotating magnetic field.

</p>
<p>Magnetic Field in the Air Gap
</p>
<p>This chapter presents an analysis of the magnetic and electrical fields in the air gap
</p>
<p>of a cylindrical machine. It is assumed that the fields come as a consequence of
</p>
<p>electrical current in the windings. The magnetic field in the air gap is created by the
</p>
<p>currents in both stator and rotor, which generate the corresponding stator and rotor
</p>
<p>magnetomotive forces.
</p>
<p>Conductors of the stator winding are placed in the grooves made on the inner
</p>
<p>surface of the stator magnetic circuit, while conductors of the rotor winding are
</p>
<p>placed in the grooves made on the outer surface of the rotor magnetic circuit. The
</p>
<p>grooves are called slots, and they are opened toward the air gap (Fig. 8.1). Thus,
</p>
<p>the conductors are placed near the air gap.
</p>
<p>It is also assumed that conductors that make up a winding are many and that they
</p>
<p>are series connected. They are not located in the same slot. Instead, the conductors
</p>
<p>are distributed along the circumference of the air gap. Conductor density can be
</p>
<p>determined by counting the number of conductors distributed along one unit length
</p>
<p>of the circumference. To begin with, it is assumed that the windings are formed with
</p>
<p>sinusoidal distribution of conductor density. Namely, the number of conductors
</p>
<p>placed in the fragment R�Dy of the circumference (Fig. 8.2) is determined by the
function cosy, where the angle y determines the position of the observed fragment.
</p>
<p>When electrical currents are fed into the winding, they create a sinusoidal distributed
</p>
<p>current sheet, also called sinusoidally distributed current sheet. With these
</p>
<p>assumptions, the subsequent analysis determines expressions for radial and tangen-
</p>
<p>tial components of the magnetic field in the air gap, for magnetomotive forces of
</p>
<p>the stator and rotor windings, and for fluxes per turn and the winding fluxes. The
</p>
<p>subsequent passages also introduce the notation aimed to simplify the presentation
</p>
<p>of the windings, magnetomotive forces, and fluxes. At the same time, the energy of
</p>
<p>the magnetic field in the air gap and electromagnetic torque are calculates as well,
</p>
<p>the torque being a measure of mechanical interaction between the stator and rotor.
</p>
<p>Further on, relation between the torque and machine dimensions is analyzed.
</p>
<p>Eventually, conditions for creating rotating magnetic field in the air gap are studied
</p>
<p>and specified.

<p>8.1 Stator Winding with Distributed Conductors
</p>
<p>Electrical machines are usually of cylindrical shape. An example of the cross
</p>
<p>section of a cylindrical machine is shown in Fig. 8.1. The magnetic circuit is
</p>
<p>made of iron sheets in order to reduce iron losses. The sheets forming magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits of the stator and rotor are coaxially placed, and they have shapes shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.1. Stator has a form of a hollow cylinder. Rotor is a cylinder with slightly
</p>
<p>smaller diameter than the internal diameter of the stator. Distance d between the
</p>
<p>stator and rotor is of the order of one millimeter and is called air gap. The air gap is
</p>
<p>considerably smaller than radius of the rotor cylinder R, d � R. The sheets are
made of iron, ferromagnetic material with permeability much higher than m0; thus,
</p>
<p>the intensity HFe of magnetic field in iron is up to thousand times lower compared
</p>
<p>to the intensity H0 of magnetic field in the air gap. Therefore, HFe can be neglected
</p>
<p>in most cases. Due to d � R, the changes of H0 along the air gap d can be
neglected. For this reason, the value of the contour integral of magnetic field H in
</p>
<p>an electrical machine is reduced to the sum of products H0d, also called magnetic
</p>
<p>voltage drop across the air gap.
</p>
<p>Conductors of the stator and rotor are laid along the axis of the cylinder and
</p>
<p>placed next to the surface which separates the magnetic circuit and the air gap. They
</p>
<p>can be on both stator and rotor sides. Figure 8.2 shows conductors of the stator. The
</p>
<p>sign� represents a conductor carrying current away from the reader, while the sign
� represents a conductor carrying current toward the reader. One pair of conductors
connected in series makes up one contour or one turn. Conductors making one turn
</p>
<p>are usually positioned on the opposite sides of the cylinder, at an angular displace-
</p>
<p>ment of p (diametrically positioned conductors).
</p>
<p>The conductors are positioned along circumference of the cylinder so that their
</p>
<p>line density (number of conductors per unit length R�Dy) varies sinusoidally as
function of angular displacement y (i.e., cosy). In cases where the function cosy
</p>
<p>suggests a negative number, it is understood that the number of actual conductors is
</p>
<p>positive, but direction of the current in these conductors is changed (diametrically
</p>
<p>positioned conductors are denoted by � and �).
Line density of conductors in the stator winding, shown in Fig. 8.3, changes
</p>
<p>sinusoidally, and it can be modeled by function
</p>
<p>N0S y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; N

S max � cos y (8.1)
</p>
<p>Function NS
0 (y) gives the number of conductors per unit length along the internal
</p>
<p>circumference of the stator magnetic circuit. If a very small segment dy is consid-
</p>
<p>ered, the corresponding fraction of the circumference length is dl &frac14; R dy, while the
number of conductors within this fraction is

<p>density of conductors carrying current in the opposite direction (�) corresponds to
position y &frac14; p. According to Fig. 8.2, over the interval from y &frac14; �p/2 up to
y &frac14; p/2, there are conductors with reference direction �, while from y &frac14; p/2 up
to y &frac14; 3p/2, there are conductors with reference direction �.
</p>
<p>One pair of diametrically placed conductors (� and �) forms one turn or one
contour. The considered winding is obtained by connecting several turns in series.
</p>
<p>The total number of turns NT can be determined by counting conductors having

<p>8.2 Sinusoidal Current Sheet
</p>
<p>Electrical current in series-connected, spatially distributed stator conductors forms
</p>
<p>a current sheet on the inner surface of the stator cylinder. Current direction from the
</p>
<p>reader � extends in the interval �p/2 &lt; y &lt; p/2, while the direction toward the
reader � extends over the interval p/2 &lt; y&lt; 3p/2. Distribution of current over this
surface is shown in Fig. 8.2.
</p>
<p>The considered current sheet has the line density of surface currents dependent
</p>
<p>on the line density of conductors. The line density of the current sheet over the inner
</p>
<p>surface of the stator cylinder is denoted by JS(y), and it is function of the angular
</p>
<p>displacement y. It is determined by the density of conductors N0S(y) and the current
</p>
<p>strength in a single conductor. Since the stator winding is formed by connecting the
</p>
<p>conductors in series, all the conductors carry the same current i1(t), also called
</p>
<p>the stator current. Current through conductors is determined by the reference
</p>
<p>direction, shown in Fig. 8.2, and algebraic intensity i1(t) of the current supplied to
</p>
<p>the winding at the two winding ends, also called terminals. Line density of the
</p>
<p>surface currents is determined by (8.4):
</p>
<p>JS y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; N

S y&eth; &THORN; � i1 &frac14; N
</p>
<p>0
S max � i1&eth; &THORN; cos y (8.4)

0
S max � i1
</p>
<p>one obtains
</p>
<p>JS y&eth; &THORN; &frac14; JS0 cos y (8.5)
</p>
<p>Considering a small segment dy, the corresponding part of the circumference is
</p>
<p>dl &frac14; R dy, and the total current within this segment is
</p>
<p>di &frac14; JS y&eth; &THORN;R dy
</p>
<p>Electrical currents in axially placed conductors create magnetic field within the
</p>
<p>machine. By considering the boundary surface between the air gap and magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit made of iron (ferromagnetic), it can be noted that the magnetic flux entering
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic material from the air gap does not change its value; thus, the
</p>
<p>orthogonal components of magnetic induction B in the air (B0) and the ferromag-
</p>
<p>netic material (BFe) are equal. Since permeability mFe of the ferromagnetic material
</p>
<p>is considerably higher than permeability m0 of the air, it is justifiable to neglect the
</p>
<p>field HFe in the ferromagnetic material and consider that field H exists only in
</p>
<p>the air gap.
</p>
<p>8.2 Sinusoidal Current Sheet 157</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Question (8.1): In cases where current sheet density is zero, is it possible that the
tangential component of the field H exists in the air next to the inner surface of
</p>
<p>the magnetic circuit of the stator?
</p>
<p>Answer (8.1): It is necessary to consider magnetic field in the immediate vicinity
of the surface separating the air gap and magnetic circuit of the stator. In the
</p>
<p>absence of electrical currents, the tangential component of the magnetic field in
</p>
<p>the air must be equal to the tangential component of the magnetic field in iron. Since
</p>
<p>permeability of iron is so high that intensity of the field H in iron can be neglected,
</p>
<p>the tangential component of the field H in iron is considered to be zero.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the tangential component of the magnetic field in the air is zero as well.
</p>
<p>8.3 Components of Stator Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>It is required to determine the components of the magnetic fieldH created in the air
</p>
<p>gap by the sheet of stator currents. The air gap is of cylindrical shape; therefore, it is
</p>
<p>convenient to adopt the cylindrical coordinate system. The unit vectors of this
</p>
<p>system, indicating the radial (r), axial (z), and tangential (u) directions, are
</p>
<p>presented in Fig. 8.4. Axis (z) is directed toward the reader (�). For the purpose
of denoting individual components of the magnetic field, magnetic induction, and
</p>
<p>induced electrical field in the air gap, the following rules are adopted:
</p>
<p>&bull; Components of the field originated by the stator currents are denoted by super-
</p>
<p>script &ldquo;S&rdquo; (HS), while components of the field created by the rotor currents are
</p>
<p>denoted by superscript &ldquo;R&rdquo; (HR).
</p>
<p>&bull; Radial components of the field are denoted by subscript &ldquo;r&rdquo; (Hr), tangential by
</p>
<p>subscript &ldquo;y &rdquo; (Hy), and axial by subscript &ldquo;z&rdquo; (Hz).
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.4 Unit vectors

<p>components of magnetic
</p>
<p>field
</p>
<p>158 8 Magnetic Field in the Air Gap</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Thus, the radial component of the magnetic field created by the stator winding is
</p>
<p>denoted byHr
S, while the axial component of the magnetic field created by the rotor
</p>
<p>winding is denoted by Hz
R.
</p>
<p>8.3.1 Axial Component of the Field
</p>
<p>In electrical machines having magnetic circuits of cylindrical shape and with
</p>
<p>conductors positioned in parallel with the cylinder axis, that is, axis z of the
</p>
<p>cylindrical coordinate system, axial component of magnetic field is equal to zero.
</p>
<p>This statement can be confirmed by considering Fig. 8.5.
</p>
<p>Figure 8.5 shows the front and side views of closed rectangular contour C. It has
</p>
<p>the length L and the width a. The two longer sides of the contour are positioned
</p>
<p>along the axis z. The longer sides of the contour are denoted by� and� in the cross
section of the machine, shown on the left side in Fig. 8.5. One of the two sides (�)
passes through magnetic circuit of the stator which is made of iron. The axial
</p>
<p>component of magnetic field in iron is denoted by Hz(Fe). The other side of the
</p>
<p>rectangular contour (�) passes through the air gap. The axial component of
magnetic field in the air gap is denoted by Hz(A).
</p>
<p>In most general case, electrical machine may have electrical currents in all the
</p>
<p>three directions: radial, tangential, and axial. Tangential current would be
</p>
<p>represented by a circular path on the left side of the figure, while on the right side
</p>
<p>of the figure, their direction is from the observer into the drawing. Assuming that
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.5 Cross section (a) and longitudinal cross section (b) of a narrow rectangular contour C
positioned along axis z. Width a of the contour EFGH is considerably smaller than its length L.
</p>
<p>Signs � and � in the left-hand part of the figure indicate reference direction of the contour and do
not indicate direction of the magnetic field. Reference directions of the magnetic field are indicated
</p>
<p>in Fig. 8.2.

<p>the machine comprises conductors with electrical currents in tangential direction
</p>
<p>and that these conductors are placed on the inner side of the stator, they can be
</p>
<p>modeled as the current sheet with line density Jy, as shown in Fig. 8.5. Surface
</p>
<p>integral of Jy over the surface S which is encircled by the contour C is equal to
</p>
<p>the line integral of the magnetic field along the contour. Each of the four sides of the
</p>
<p>contour makes its own contribution to the integral. In cases where the course of

<p>the integral of the radial component of the magnetic field along sides FE and HG
</p>
<p>can be neglected; thus, the line integral along contour C is reduced to the integral
</p>
<p>along sides GF and EH:

</p>
<p>Since permeability of iron is very high and the magnetic induction in iron BFe
has finite value, the magnetic field strength HFe &frac14; BFe/mFe in iron is very low. It can
be considered equal to zero. Therefore, line integral along the contour shown in

<p>Fig. 8.5 is reduced to the integral of magnetic field along side EH:

<p>Electrical currents in rotating electrical machines exist in insulated copper
</p>
<p>conductors. These conductors are placed in slots, carved on the inner surface of
</p>
<p>the stator magnetic circuit and along the rotor cylinder. The slots extend axially, they
</p>
<p>are parallel to the axis of the cylinder and also parallel to z axis. Hence, in cylindrical
</p>
<p>electrical machines, only z component of electrical currents can exist. Thus, the
</p>
<p>density of tangential currents Jy is equal to zero. Therefore, the value of the integral
</p>
<p>of the axial component of the magnetic field along the side EH is also zero. Under
</p>
<p>assumption that Hz(A) remains constant, Jy &frac14; 0 proves that Hz(A) &frac14; 0. Yet, there is
no proof at this point that Hz(A) remains constant along the machine length.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The contour C can be chosen in such way that its length L is considerably smaller
</p>
<p>than the overall axial length of the machine. In such case, there are no significant
</p>
<p>variations of the field Hz(A) along the side EH, and the expression (8.6) assumes the
</p>
<p>value:

<p>H

<p>E
</p>
<p>Hz&eth;A&THORN; dl � Hz&eth;A&THORN;L (8.7)
</p>
<p>which leads to conclusion that Hz(A) &frac14; 0. There is also another way to prove that
the axial component of the field is equal to zero. Statement Hz(A) &frac14; 0 can be proved
even if the contour length L is longer and becomes comparable to the axial length of
</p>
<p>the machine. The integral in (8.6) is equal to zero for an arbitrary choice of points H
</p>
<p>and E, and this is possible only if the axial component of magnetic field in the air
</p>
<p>gap Hz(A) is equal to zero at all points along the axis z. This statement can be
</p>
<p>supported by the following consideration.
</p>
<p>The contour C (EHGF) can be slightly extended by moving the side FE into
</p>
<p>position F1E1, wherein the points E and E1 are very close. In such way, the contour
</p>
<p>C1 is formed, defined by the points E1HGF1. In the absence of electrical currents in
</p>
<p>tangential direction (Jy), the line integral of the field H along the contour C is equal
</p>
<p>to zero. The same holds for the contour C1. For the reasons given above, the line
</p>
<p>integral along the contour C reduces to the integral along the side EH, while the line
</p>
<p>integral along the contour C1 reduces to the integral along the side E1H. Both
</p>
<p>integrals are equal to zero. Therefore, the line integral of the field H along the side
</p>
<p>EE1 has to be equal to zero as well. The point E1 can be placed next to the point E,
</p>
<p>so that the changes in the field strength H from E to E1 become negligible. At this
</p>
<p>point, the line integral along the side EE1 reduces to the product of the path length
</p>
<p>EE1 and the field strength Hz(A) at the point E, leading to Hz(A) &frac14; 0. This statement
applies for arbitrary choice of points E and E1. This proves that the axial component
</p>
<p>of the magnetic field in the air gap is equal to zero. Notice that all the above
</p>
<p>considerations start with the assumption that the machine cylinder is very long and
</p>
<p>that the field changes at the ends of the cylinder are negligible.
</p>
<p>Magnetic circuit of electrical machines has the stator hollow cylinder and the
</p>
<p>rotor cylinder, both made of iron sheets. At both ends of the cylinder, the air gap
</p>
<p>opens toward the outer space. Considering the windings, each turn has two diamet-
</p>
<p>rical conductors. The ends of these conductors have to be tied by the end turns,
</p>
<p>denoted by D in Fig. 5.6. The end turns are found at both the front and the rare side
</p>
<p>of the cylinder. Electrical current in end turns extends in tangential direction. Due to
</p>
<p>the air gap opening toward the outer space and due to end turns, there is local
</p>
<p>dispersion of the flux at both ends of the machine in the vicinity of the air gap
</p>
<p>opening. Therefore, a relatively small z component of the magnetic field may be
</p>
<p>established toward the ends of cylindrical machines. Above-described end effects
</p>
<p>and parasitic axial field are neglected throughout this book. It should be mentioned
</p>
<p>that the above-mentioned effects should be considered in the analysis of machines
</p>
<p>with an unusually small axial length L and with diameter 2R considerably larger
</p>
<p>than the axial length L.

<p>8.3.2 Tangential Component of the Field
</p>
<p>The analysis carried out in this subsection determines the tangential component of
</p>
<p>the magnetic field Hy
S in the air gap, produced by electrical currents in the stator
</p>
<p>winding. Tangential component of the field is calculated in the air gap, next to the
</p>
<p>inner side of the stator. Namely, the observed region is close to the boundary
</p>
<p>surface separating the magnetic circuit of the stator and the air gap.
</p>
<p>Boundary conditions for the magnetic field at the surface separating two differ-
</p>
<p>ent media are studied by electromagnetic. In the case with no electrical currents
</p>
<p>over the surface, tangential components of vector H are equal at both sides of the
</p>
<p>surface. By considering the surface separating the stator magnetic circuit and the air
</p>
<p>gap (Fig. 8.6), it can be stated that tangential component of the magnetic field in
</p>
<p>iron is equal to zero (HFe &frac14; BFe/mFe). This is due to magnetic induction BFe in iron
being finite and permeability mFe of iron being very high. Therefore, it is possible to
</p>
<p>conclude that the tangential component of magnetic field Hy
S in the air, next to the
</p>
<p>inner stator surface, is equal to zero in all cases where the stator winding does not
</p>
<p>carry electrical currents.
</p>
<p>In the example considered above, the magnetic field in the air gap is analyzed as a
</p>
<p>consequence of the stator currents. Besides these currents, the machine can also have
</p>
<p>electrical currents in rotor conductors. With the stator currents equal to zero
</p>
<p>(JS &frac14; 0), the fieldHyS against the inner stator surface is equal to zero, notwithstand-
ing the rotor currents. Hence, the rotor currents do not have any influence on
</p>
<p>tangential component of the magnetic field in the air gap region next to the stator
</p>
<p>surface. Moreover, tangential components of magnetic field in the air gap are not the
</p>
<p>same against the inner surface of the stator and against the outer surface of the rotor.
</p>
<p>It is known that in close vicinity of a plane which carries a uniform sheet of
</p>
<p>surface currents with line density s, there is magnetic field of the strengthH &frac14; s /2,
wherein the field is parallel to the plane and orthogonal to the current, while the plane
</p>
<p>resides in air or vacuum. In cases where the surface currents exist in the plane
</p>
<p>separating high-permeability ferromagnetic material and the air, the field in the air is
</p>
<p>H &frac14; s. This statement can be proved with the help of Fig. 8.6. The figure shows the
plane separating a space filled with air (left) from a space filled by ferromagnetic
</p>
<p>material (right). The boundary plane carries a uniform current sheet of line density s.
</p>
<p>Closed contour EFGH is of the length L and width a, considerably smaller than the
</p>
<p>length. Line integral of the magnetic field along the closed rectangular contour is
</p>
<p>equal to Ls, and it sums all the currents passing through the contour. Since magnetic
</p>
<p>field in the ferromagnetic material is very low, the integral along side FG can be
</p>
<p>neglected. Because a �L, integral of the magnetic field along the closed contour is
reduced to the product of side HE length and the field strengthHA. Since Ls &frac14; LHA,
it is shown that the magnetic field strength in the air is equal to the line current
</p>
<p>density s. In the same way, it can be concluded that tangential component of the
</p>
<p>magnetic field Hy in the air gap of a cylindrical machine in the vicinity of the inner
</p>
<p>side of the stator will be equal to the line density of stator currents, while the fieldHy

<p>close to the rotor will be equal to the line density of rotor currents. First of the two
</p>
<p>statements will be proved by using Fig. 8.6.
</p>
<p>It is of interest to consider the closed contour EFGH, having very short sides EF
</p>
<p>and GH, with circular arcs FG and HE having roughly the same lengths RDy, where
</p>
<p>R is internal radius of the stator. Circular arc HE passes through ferromagnetic
</p>
<p>stator core, while circular arc FG passes through the air in the immediate vicinity of
</p>
<p>the stator inner surface.

<p>Line integral of the magnetic field along closed contour EFGH is equal to the
</p>
<p>sum of all currents flowing through the surface leaning on the contour. In the
</p>
<p>considered case, there are surface currents of the stator with line density JS(y).
</p>
<p>If a relatively narrow segment is considered, such that Dy � p, it is justified to
assume that the line current density JS(y) does not change over the arc FG, and the
</p>
<p>line integral of the magnetic field along the contour becomes

</p>
<p>Since the strength of the magnetic field in iron is very small and sides EF and GH
</p>
<p>are very short, the line integral along the closed contour reduces to the integral of
</p>
<p>the component Hy
S of the magnetic field in the air along the arc FG. With the
</p>
<p>assumption Dy � p, it is justified to consider that the field strength Hy
S does not

<p>On the basis of expressions (8.8) and (8.9), in the region close to the inner

<p>equal to the line current density of the stator current sheet:

<p>8.3.3 Radial Component of the Field
</p>
<p>Calculation of radial component of the magnetic field in the air gap relies on the line
</p>
<p>integral of the field along the closed contour EFGH shown in Fig. 8.8. Side EF of the
</p>
<p>contour is positioned along radial direction at position y &frac14; 0. It starts from the stator
magnetic circuit, passes through the air gap in direction opposite to the reference
</p>
<p>direction of the radial component of the field (inside-out), and ends up in the rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit. Side GH is positioned radially at y &frac14; y1. It starts from the
rotor magnetic circuit, passes through the air gap in the reference direction of the
</p>
<p>radial component of the field, and comes back into the stator magnetic circuit. The
</p>
<p>contour has two circular arcs, FG and HE. They have approximately equal length
</p>
<p>Ry1, and they pass through magnetic circuits of the rotor (FG) and stator (HE).
</p>
<p>Due to a very high permeability of iron, the strength HFe &frac14; BFe/mFe of the
magnetic field is negligible in these segments of the contour which pass through
</p>
<p>164 8 Magnetic Field in the Air Gap</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>iron. Therefore, it can be considered that the magnetic field exists only along
</p>
<p>segments EF and GH passing through the air gap. These segments are of length
</p>
<p>d, considerably smaller compared to the radius of the machine (d � R). It is thus
justified to assume that intensity of the radial component of the magnetic field along
</p>
<p>sides EF and GH in the air gap does not change along this short path d through the
</p>
<p>air gap. At position y &frac14; 0, the field strength is Hr
S(0), while at position y &frac14; y1,
</p>
<p>the field strength is Hr
S(y1). With these assumptions, line integral of the magnetic
</p>
<p>field along the contour (circulation) becomes
</p>
<p>&eth;
</p>
<p>C
</p>
<p>~H � d~l &frac14; &thorn;d � HSr &eth;y1&THORN; � d � H
S
r &eth;0&THORN;: (8.11)
</p>
<p>Negative sign in front of Hr
S(0) in the preceding expression indicates that the
</p>
<p>direction along the side EF of the contour is opposite to the reference direction for
</p>
<p>the radial component of the magnetic field, as defined in the cylindrical coordinate
</p>
<p>system.
</p>
<p>Circulation of vectorH along the closed contour EFGH is equal to the sum of all
</p>
<p>currents passing through the surface leaning on the contour, that is, to the integral of
</p>
<p>the surface currents of line density JS(y) between the limits y &frac14; 0 and y &frac14; y1
(8.12). By comparing Fig. 8.8 to Figs. 8.2 and 8.3, it can be concluded that the
</p>
<p>highest line density of the stator surface currents takes place at y &frac14; 0. The line
density of stator currents is determined by (8.1):

<p>In position y1, the radial component of the air gap magnetic field caused by the

</p>
<p>In order to calculate radial component of the field, it is necessary to determine
</p>
<p>the constant Hr
S(0).
</p>
<p>In cases when the stator currents are absent (JS0 &frac14; 0), expression (8.13) reduces
to Hr
</p>
<p>S(y) &frac14; HrS(0). With JS0 &frac14; 0, the field caused by the stator currents should be
zero as well. This can be proved by the following consideration. If constantHr
</p>
<p>S(0) is
</p>
<p>positive while JS0 &frac14; 0, radial component of the magnetic field in the air gap does not
change along the machine circumference, and it is directed from rotor toward stator.
</p>
<p>On these grounds, it is possible to show that constant Hr
S(0) has to be equal to zero.
</p>
<p>In courses on Electrical Engineering Fundamentals and Electromagnetics, it is
</p>
<p>shown that the flux of the vector B which comes out of a closed surface S must
</p>
<p>be equal to zero. An example of the closed surface S can be the one enveloping the
</p>
<p>rotor of an electrical machine. This surface has three parts, cylindrical surface
</p>
<p>passing through the air gap and the two flat, round parts at both machine ends,
</p>
<p>representing the bases of the cylinder. The flux of the vector B through the surface S
</p>
<p>is called the output flux, and it is calculated according to
</p>
<p>&thorn;
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>~B � d~S &frac14; 0
</p>
<p>Differential form of the preceding statement is

<p>div ~B &frac14; 0;
</p>
<p>and it represents one out of four Maxwell equations. Divergence is a spatial
</p>
<p>derivative of a vector which can be used for establishing the relation between the
</p>
<p>surface integral (2D) of the vector over a closed surface S and the space integral
</p>
<p>(3D) of the spatial derivative of the same vector within the domain encircled by the
</p>
<p>closed surface S. Therefore, the information on the divergence of vector B in
</p>
<p>domain V, encircled by surface S, can be used to calculate the output flux of the
</p>
<p>vector B:

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The law given by (8.14) can be used to prove that the constant Hr
S(0) equals
</p>
<p>zero. It is necessary to note a closed surface S of cylindrical form, enveloping the
</p>
<p>rotor in the way that the cylindrical part S1 passes through the air gap while the two
</p>
<p>flat round parts (basis) stay in front and at the rare of the rotor.
</p>
<p>Equation 8.7 shows that axial component of the magnetic field Hz in electrical
</p>
<p>machines is zero. Due to Bz &frac14; m0Hz in the air, the same holds for the magnetic
induction; hence, Bz &frac14; 0. As a consequence, the flux of the vector B through the
front and rear basis of the closed cylindrical surface S is equal to zero. In accor-
</p>
<p>dance with the law (8.14), the flux through the cylindrical surface S1 passing
</p>
<p>through the air gap must be equal to zero as well.
</p>
<p>Relation B &frac14; m0H connects the magnetic field strength H and the magnetic
induction B in the air. Since the permeability m0 does not vary, flux of the vector
</p>
<p>H through the cylindrical surface S1 residing in the air gap can be obtained by
</p>
<p>dividing the flux of vector B through the same surface by the permeability m0.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the flux of the vectorH through the same surface must be equal to zero as
</p>
<p>well as the flux of the vector B. In the case when JS0 &frac14; 0 and HrS(y) &frac14; HrS(0), the
flux of the magnetic field H through the cylindrical surface S1 is equal to 2pRL
</p>
<p>Hr
S(0), where R is the radius and L is the length of the machine, which completes
</p>
<p>the proof that constant Hr
S(0) in (8.13) has to be equal to zero. Having proved that
</p>
<p>Hr
S(0) &frac14; 0, one can obtain the expression for the radial component of the magnetic
</p>
<p>field in the air gap.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 8.8, position y1 of side GH of the contour EFGH is arbitrarily chosen.
</p>
<p>Therefore, all previous considerations are applicable at any position y1. Thus, it can
</p>
<p>be concluded that radial component of the magnetic field created in the air gap by
</p>
<p>the stator currents is equal to
</p>
<p>HSr &eth;y&THORN; &frac14;
JS0R
</p>
<p>d
sin y; (8.15)
</p>
<p>where the above expression defines the strength of the stator magnetic fieldHr at the
</p>
<p>position y within the air gap. The expression is applicable in cases where only the
</p>
<p>stator windings carry electrical currents and when these currents can be represented
</p>
<p>by surface currents with sinusoidal distribution around the machine circumference.
</p>
<p>Question (8.2): Consider a closed surface which partially passes through the air
and partially through ferromagnetic material such as iron. Is it possible to prove that
</p>
<p>the output flux of the field H though this closed surface is equal to zero? Is it
</p>
<p>possible to prove that the output flux of induction B through this closed surface is
</p>
<p>equal to zero?
</p>
<p>Answer (8.2): According to (8.14), the output flux of the vector of magnetic
induction through any closed surface S is equal to zero. This law is applicable in
</p>
<p>homogeneousmedia, where permeability does not change, but also in themedia with
</p>
<p>variable permeability, as well as the media comprising parts of different permeabil-
</p>
<p>ity. Therefore, the output flux of magnetic induction is also equal to zero through the
</p>
<p>closed surface passing through the air in one part and through iron in the other part.
</p>
<p>8.3 Components of Stator Magnetic Field 167</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Equation 8.14 deals with magnetic induction B. It is applicable to magnetic field H
</p>
<p>only in cases where the permeability m &frac14; B/H does not change over the integration
domain. Therefore, if surface S passes through media of different permeability, it
</p>
<p>cannot be stated that output flux of the vector H through a closed surface is equal
</p>
<p>to zero.

<p>8.4 Review of Stator Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>The subject of the preceding analysis is cylindrical electrical machine of the length
</p>
<p>L, with the rotor outer diameter 2R. The rotor is placed in hollow, cylindrical stator
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit so that an air gap d � R exists between the stator and rotor cores.
The magnetic field is created in the air gap by electrical currents in the stator
</p>
<p>winding. The stator windings have a sinusoidal distribution of their conductors
</p>
<p>along the circumference. Therefore, the stator currents can be replaced by a sheet of
</p>
<p>surface currents extending in axial direction, with a sinusoidal change of their
</p>
<p>density around the machine circumference. This current sheet is located on the
</p>
<p>inner side of the stator magnetic circuit, facing the air gap. The line density of
</p>
<p>the surface currents (8.4) is determined by the conductor density (8.1) and the
</p>
<p>electrical current i1 in stator winding. As a consequence of the stator magne-
</p>
<p>tomotive force, magnetic field is established in the air gap, with its axial, radial,
</p>
<p>and tangential components discussed above. Due to a very high permeability of
</p>
<p>iron, it is correct to assume that the magnetic field strength in iron is negligible.
</p>
<p>In cylindrical coordinate system, the axial component of the fieldH in the air gap
</p>
<p>is equal to zero, while the tangential and radial components are given by
</p>
<p>expressions (8.17) and (8.18):
</p>

<p>Question (8.3): Consider a cylindrical machine of known dimensions having the
stator winding with only one turn made out of conductors A1 and A2. Conductor A1

y &frac14; 0. The other conductor (A2) is at position y &frac14; p, and it carries current in

they are fed from a current source of constant current I0. Determine the radial

<p>component of magnetic field Hr
S(y) in an arbitrary position y. If the rotor revolves,
</p>
<p>what is the form of the electromotive force that would be induced in a single rotor
</p>
<p>conductor axially positioned on the surface of the rotor cylinder? What is the form
</p>
<p>of this electromotive force in cases where radial component of the stator field
</p>
<p>changes according to 8.18?
</p>
<p>Answer (8.3): It is necessary to envisage a contour which passes through both
stator and rotor magnetic circuits. This contour has to pass through the turn A1&ndash;A2,
</p>
<p>encircling one of the conductors. Such contour is passing across the air gap two
</p>
<p>times, both passages extending in radial direction. The circulation of the vector H
</p>
<p>(i.e., the line integral ofH around the closed contour) is equal to the current strength
</p>
<p>I0. Thus, the radial component of the magnetic field in the air gap is Hm &frac14; I0/(2d).
Direction of the radial field depends on the position along the circumference. Along
</p>
<p>the first half of the circumference, starting from the conductor A1 and moving
</p>
<p>clockwise toward the conductor A2, direction of the magnetic field is from the stator
</p>
<p>toward the rotor, while in the remaining half of the circumference, direction of the
</p>
<p>field is from the rotor toward the stator. Therefore, variation of the magnetic field in
</p>
<p>the air gap can be described by the functionHr
S(y) &frac14; Hm sgn(sin y). In the case when
</p>
<p>the rotor revolves at a speed O, position of the rotor conductor changes as y &frac14; y0
&thorn; Ot, where y0 denotes the position of the rotor conductor at t &frac14; 0. The
electromotive force induced in the conductor is e &frac14; LvB, where L is the length of
the conductor and v &frac14; RO is the peripheral velocity, while B &frac14; m0HrS is algebraic
intensity of the vector B around the conductor. Therefore, the change of the
</p>
<p>electromotive force is determined by the function Hr
S(y) &frac14; HrS(y0 &thorn; Ot). In the
</p>
<p>example given above, the electromotive force would change as sgn(sin (y0 &thorn; Ot).
In cases where the field Hr
</p>
<p>S(y) changes in a sinusoidal manner, the electromotive
</p>
<p>force induced in rotor conductors would be sinusoidal as well.

<p>The subject of the previous analysis was the magnetic field created by the stator
</p>
<p>winding. Figure 8.10 shows the lines of the radial field. The stator conductors are
</p>
<p>not shown in this figure, neither is the detailed representation of sinusoidally

<p>position of the maximum current density are denoted by placing symbols � and
�. The field lines shown in the figure correspond to sinusoidal change of the
magnetic field H and magnetic induction B along the machine circumference, in
</p>
<p>accordance with (8.18). The regions on the inner surface of the stator magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit with the highest density of the fields B andH are denoted as the north (N) and
</p>
<p>south (S) magnetic pole. In the region of the north pole of the stator magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit, the field lines come out of the stator core and enter the air gap, while in the
</p>
<p>zone of the south magnetic pole, the field lines from the air gap enter the ferromag-
</p>
<p>netic core (Fig. 8.9).

<p>The previous analysis and Fig. 8.10 represent the magnetic field produced by
</p>
<p>only one stator winding. An electrical machine has a number of stator and rotor
</p>
<p>windings. The resulting magnetic field comes as a consequence of several magneto-
</p>
<p>motive forces. The magnetomotive force of each winding creates the field
</p>
<p>represented by the field lines similar to those in Fig. 8.10. An effort of presenting
</p>
<p>several such fields in a single drawing would be rather difficult to follow, let alone
</p>
<p>getting useful in making conclusions and design decisions.
</p>
<p>In further analyses, the magnetic field produced by single winding can be
</p>
<p>represented in a concise way by introducing the flux vector of the winding.
</p>
<p>Magnetic flux is an integral of the vector B over the given surface S. The result
</p>
<p>of such integration is a scalar. Yet, the flux in an electrical machine is tied to the
</p>
<p>normal n on the surface S, and it depends on spatially oriented field of B. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the flux is also called directed scalar. Considering the magnetic field created by a

<p>single turn, it is possible to calculate the flux as a scalar quantity and to define the
</p>
<p>flux vector by associating the course and direction to the scalar value. In Sect. 4.4,
</p>
<p>the flux in a single turn is represented by the flux vector, wherein the spatial
</p>
<p>orientation and reference direction are determined from the normal to the surface
</p>
<p>S defined by the contour C, made out by the single-turn conductors.
</p>
<p>In most cases, a winding consists of a number of turns connected in series. All
</p>
<p>the turns may not share the same spatial orientation. Therefore, the normals on the
</p>
<p>surfaces, leaning on individual turns, may not be collinear. Hence, there is a need to
</p>
<p>clarify the course and direction of the winding flux. In cases where the winding is
</p>
<p>concentrated, all the conductors reside on only two diametrical slots, and all the turns
</p>
<p>have the same orientation. Therefore, their normals coincide and define the spatial
</p>
<p>orientation of the winding flux vector. Yet, the same approach cannot be applied in
</p>
<p>cases where the winding conductors and its turns are distributed along the machine
</p>
<p>circumference.
</p>
<p>The flux shown in Fig. 8.10 is created by the currents in conductors that are
</p>
<p>sinusoidally distributed along the inner surface of the stator. A pair of diametrical
</p>
<p>conductors constitutes one contour, that is, a single turn. The normals on individual
</p>
<p>turns are obviously not collinear. Yet, the winding flux can be represented by a
</p>
<p>vector1 collinear with the winding axis. Determination of the windings axes is

<p>1 Interpretation of magnetic flux as a vector can be understood as a convention and a very suitable
</p>
<p>engineering tool in the analysis of complex electromagnetic processes taking place in electrical
</p>
<p>machines. Nevertheless, magnetic flux is a scalar by definition. It may be called directed scalar, as
</p>
<p>it is closely related to the spatial orientation of relevant turn or winding, and it depends on the
</p>
<p>course and direction of the vector of magnetic induction. Magnetic flux C can be compared to the
</p>
<p>strength I of spatially distributed electrical currents, which describe the phenomenon of moving
</p>
<p>electrical charges. The following illustration shows spatial currents passing through the surface S
</p>
<p>which is leaning on the contour c:
</p>
<p>The vector of current density J gives direction of the current I through the contour. Its integral

<p>with spatially distributed conductors is presented further on.

<p>The flux vector is determined by its course, direction, and amplitude. The vector
</p>
<p>presented in the right-hand side of Fig. 8.10 represents the field of magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B, distributed sinusoidally over the air gap and shown in the left-hand
</p>
<p>side of the figure. Direction of the flux is determined by the course of the field lines,
</p>
<p>which start from the north magnetic pole (N) of the stator, pass through the air gap,
</p>
<p>enter into the rotor magnetic circuit, then pass for the second time through the air
</p>
<p>gap, and enter into the stator magnetic circuit in the region of the south pole (S).
</p>
<p>Direction of the flux is determined by direction of the magnetic field H and
</p>
<p>induction B.
</p>
<p>In linear ferromagnetic and in the air gap, the vectors B and H have the same
</p>
<p>course and direction due to B &frac14; mH. Spatial distribution of the field lines
representing magnetic induction B can be represented by the flux vector F. The
flux amplitude F and the magnetomotive force F are related by F &frac14; RmF, where Rm
is magnetic resistance encountered along the flux path, that is, magnetic resistance
</p>
<p>of the magnetic circuit. It is of interest to notice that the magnetomotive force F can
</p>
<p>be represented by vector F, which represents the spatial distribution of the field H.
</p>
<p>Due to B &frac14; mH, such vector is collinear with F, while its amplitude is F &frac14; RmF,
and it is equal to the circulation of the vector H along the flux path.
</p>
<p>The amplitude of the flux vector FS is the surface integral of the vector B over
</p>
<p>the surface leaning on one turn of the stator winding. It is possible to define the

<p>Question (8.4): Consider Fig. 8.10, where symbols � and � denote direction of
current in conductors of the stator winding. There are 2NT conductors, sinusoidally
</p>
<p>distributed along the machine circumference, all of them carrying electrical current
</p>
<p>I. Derive the expression for the maximum value of the radial component Hr
S of the

<p>(use the previously obtained expressions and the relation between the maximum
</p>
<p>line density of conductors NSmax and the total number of conductors, NT &frac14; 2
RNSmax, H &frac14; NTI/(2d)). Determine the amplitude of the stator magnetomotive
force F.
</p>
<p>Answer (8.4): It is necessary to determine the line integral of the field H along the
closed contour starting from the north pole of the stator, going vertically toward the
</p>
<p>south magnetic pole, and closing through the stator magnetic circuit. Circulation of
</p>
<p>the vector H is NTI &frac14; 2dH. Intensity of the magnetic field is Hmax &frac14; NTI/(2d).
Magnetomotive force F is equal to the circulation of the vector H, F &frac14; NTI.
</p>
<p>Question (8.5): Assume now that the number of stator conductors does not change
and that stator current is the same, but the conductors are grouped at the places
</p>
<p>designated by � and � in Fig. 8.10. Instead of being distributed, the conductors are
concentrated in diametrical slots. Such winding is called concentrated winding.
</p>
<p>What is, in this case, the value of the line integral of the magnetic field H? Are there
</p>
<p>any changes in the maximum intensity of the field H below the north and south
</p>
<p>poles? What is the amplitude of the stator magnetomotive force F?
</p>
<p>Answer (8.5): The magnetic field strength Hmax and the magnetomotive force F
are equal as in the preceding case, H &frac14; NTI /(2d), F &frac14; NTI.
</p>
<p>Question (8.6): Compare the field distribution H(y) for concentrated and
distributed winding.
</p>
<p>Answer (8.6): On the basis of the previous expressions, magnetic field of the
winding with sinusoidally distributed conductors has a sinusoidal distribution of
</p>
<p>the magnetic field in the air gap. In the case when the conductors are concentrated,
</p>
<p>radial component of magnetic field Hr
S(y) &frac14; Hm sgn(sin y) has a constant ampli-
</p>
<p>tude along the circumference, and its direction is positive over one half and

<p>negative over the other half of the circumference. In both cases, maximum intensity
</p>
<p>of the field is H &frac14; NTI /(2d).
</p>
<p>Question (8.7): Determine the flux through a contour made of two conductors
denoted by � and � in Fig. 8.10 in the case when the winding is concentrated and
has NT conductors. All conductors of the considered winding directed toward the
</p>
<p>2Total flux C of the stator winding with N turns, with sinusoidal distribution of conductors along
</p>
<p>circumference of the stator, andwith fluxFS in one of the turns is not equal toNFS because the fluxes

<p>of individual turns are not equal. Flux FS in a single turn (contour) is function of position y.

<p>reader are in position denoted by �. The remaining conductors of the opposite
direction are in position denoted by �.
</p>
<p>Answer (8.7): It is necessary to note that the magnetic field strength in the air gap
is H &frac14; &thorn;NTI/(2d) over the interval y &isin; [0. . .p] and H &frac14; �NTI/(2d) over interval
y&isin; [p. . .2p]. The flux through the contour is obtained by calculating the integral of
</p>
<p>the magnetic induction B over the surface leaning on the contour. Since the surface
</p>
<p>integral of magnetic induction over a closed surface is equal to zero (div B &frac14; 0),
the surface integral of B through all the surfaces leaning on the same contour is the
</p>
<p>same. Therefore, there is a possibility of selecting the proper surface that would
</p>
<p>facilitate the calculation. For the surface in the air gap, the expression for magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B is known. Over the interval [0. . .p], the magnetic induction in the air
</p>
<p>gap has radial direction and intensity B &frac14; &thorn;m0NTI/(2d). The surface leaning on the
contour can be specified by the semicircular banded rectangle which leans on
</p>
<p>conductor �, passes through the air gap over the arc interval [0. . .p], and leans
on conductor �, which is positioned at y &frac14; p in Fig. 8.10. The considered surface
has the length L, width pR, and surface area S &frac14; LpR. In all parts, the vector of
magnetic induction is vertical to the surface; thus, the flux through the surface, that
</p>
<p>is, the flux through the contour, is equal to F &frac14; BS &frac14; m0 pLR NT I /(2d).
</p>
<p>Question (8.8): Determine the flux of a contour consisting of two conductors
denoted by � and � in Fig. 8.8 in the case when the winding has a sinusoidal
distribution of conductors.
</p>
<p>Answer (8.8): It is necessary to note that in the zones of magnetic poles, at
positions y &frac14; p/2 and y &frac14; 3p/2, the magnetic induction in the air gap is equal to
the one in the preceding case (Bmax &frac14; &thorn;m0NTI/(2d)), but the field changes along the
circumference. As in the preceding case of Question 8.7, the flux through
</p>
<p>the contour can be obtained by calculating the surface integral of the magnetic
</p>
<p>induction over the semicircular banded rectangle of the length L and width pR,
</p>
<p>which passes through the air gap and leans on conductors � and �. The area of the
considered surface is S &frac14; LpR. The flux cannot be calculated as BmaxS, as the
magnetic induction exhibits sinusoidal changes over the surface. The flux through
</p>
<p>the contour is equal to the product BavS, where Bav is the average value of the
</p>
<p>magnetic induction in the air gap over the interval y &isin; [0. . .p]. It is well known
</p>
<p>that the function sin(y) has an average value of 2/p on the interval y &isin; [0. . .p].
</p>
<p>Therefore, Bav &frac14; 2/pBmax. The flux through the contour is F &frac14; BavS &frac14; m0 LR
NT I /d.
</p>
<p>Question (8.9): By using the results obtained in previous two questions, specify
how do the magnetomotive force of the winding and the flux in one contour change
</p>
<p>by converting a concentrated winding into winding with sinusoidal distribution of
</p>
<p>conductors. Are there any reasons in favor of using distributed windings?
</p>
<p>Answer (8.9): If the twowindings have the same current in their conductors and the
same number of conductors, the maximum strength Hmax of the magnetic field in
</p>
<p>the air gap of the machine and the magnetomotive force F &frac14; 2dHmax are the same.
</p>
<p>174 8 Magnetic Field in the Air Gap</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For the concentrated winding, the field strength retains the same value along the
</p>
<p>circumference, while for the distributed winding, the field varies in accordance with
</p>
<p>sin(y). For this reason, the flux in one turn is smaller for the distributed winding. The
</p>
<p>ratio of the fluxes in one turn obtained in two considered cases is 2/p. Even though
</p>
<p>the flux of the distributed winding is smaller, there are reasons in favor of using the
</p>
<p>windings with sinusoidally distributed conductors. It has to do with the harmonics of
</p>
<p>the induced electromotive force. With sinusoidal distribution of the conductors
</p>
<p>along the circumference, the electromotive force induced in the winding is sinusoi-
</p>
<p>dal, unspoiled with harmonics, andwith no distortion even in cases where the change
</p>
<p>of the magnetic field along the circumference is non-sinusoidal and when the
</p>
<p>function B(y) comprises significant amount of harmonics. In the later case, a
</p>
<p>concentrated winding will have an electromotive force waveform which resembles
</p>
<p>B(y). Therefore, a winding with sinusoidal distribution of conductors has the
</p>
<p>properties of a filter. A proof of this statement will be presented in Chap. 10.

<p>8.6 Components of Rotor Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>In addition to stator windings, electrical machines usually have windings on the
</p>
<p>rotor as well. Rotor could have several windings. The following analysis will
</p>
<p>consider magnetic field produced by one rotor winding. Conductors of the consid-
</p>
<p>ered winding are placed on the surface of the rotor magnetic circuit in the close
</p>
<p>vicinity of the air gap, in the way shown in Fig. 8.11. In this figure, the conductors
</p>
<p>directed away from the reader are denoted by �, while the conductors directed
toward the reader are denoted by �. One pair of diametrically positioned
conductors creates one turn of the rotor winding. These turns are connected in
</p>
<p>series and constitute a winding.
</p>
<p>The rotor conductors are positioned along the rotor circumference in the manner
</p>
<p>that their line density varies as a sinusoidal function of the angular displacement y.
</p>
<p>The function NR
0 (y) determines the number of conductors per unit length R�Dy. The
</p>
<p>argument of the function is the angle y, measured from the reference axis of
</p>
<p>the stator, denoted by (A) in Fig. 8.11, to the place on the rotor circumference
</p>
<p>where the conductor density NR
0 (y) is observed. The angle ym is also marked in the
</p>
<p>figure, and it defines the rotor displacement from the reference axis of the
</p>
<p>stator. When the rotor revolves at a constant speed Om, the rotor position changes
</p>
<p>as ym &frac14; y 0 &thorn; Omt, where y0 is the initial position. The reference axis of the rotor is
denoted by (B). On the rotor reference axis, the angle y is equal to ym. An arbitrary
</p>
<p>position (C) is shifted by y�ym with respect to the rotor reference axis. Since the
highest line density of the rotor conductors N0Rmax is at position y &frac14; ym, the
sinusoidal distribution of conductors can be described by function

<p>If the rotor winding carries electrical current i2, the magnitude of sinusoidally
</p>
<p>distributed sheet of the rotor currents is JR0 &frac14; N0Rmax i2.
In the case when a constant current i2 &frac14; I2 exists in the rotor conductors, the
</p>
<p>sheet of the rotor currents will create magnetic field in the air gap that would not
</p>
<p>move with respect to the rotor. The spatial orientation of such field is determined by
</p>
<p>the rotor position. By analogy with the stator field shown in Fig. 8.10, the north
</p>
<p>magnetic pole of the rotor is at position y &frac14; ym &thorn; p/2, the radial component of the
rotor field at y &frac14; ym is equal to zero, and the south magnetic pole of the rotor is at
y &frac14; ym�p/2. If the rotor does not move, position of the rotor magnetic poles does
not change. When the rotor revolves, the field created by the DC current in the rotor
</p>
<p>conductors rotates with respect to the stator. The speed of the field rotation is equal
</p>
<p>to the rotor speed. In this case, position of the north magnetic pole of the rotor is

<p>Question (8.10): Conductors of the stator and rotor are placed in close vicinity of
the air gap. What are the negative effects of positioning the rotor conductors deeper
</p>
<p>in the rotor magnetic circuit, further away from the air gap?
</p>
<p>Answer (8.10): The lines of the magnetic field of a single conductor placed deeper
into the rotor magnetic circuit would close through the ferromagnetic material,
</p>
<p>where magnetic resistance is lower, instead of passing through the air gap and
</p>
<p>encircling the stator conductors. In cases where the rotor conductor is placed deep
</p>
<p>into the iron magnetic circuit, far away from the air gap, the rotor magnetic field and
</p>
<p>flux exist mainly in the rotor magnetic circuit and they do not extend neither to the
</p>
<p>air gap nor to the stator winding. For this reason, there is significant reduction of
</p>
<p>magnetic coupling between the rotor and stator windings. In such cases, most of the
</p>
<p>rotor flux is the leakage flux, the part of the rotor flux which does not encircle
</p>
<p>the stator windings. With the electromechanical conversion process being based on
</p>
<p>the magnetic coupling, an increased rotor leakage greatly reduces the electromag-
</p>
<p>netic torque and the conversion power. On the other hand, the rotor leakage is
</p>
<p>reduced by placing the rotor conductors in rotor slots, next to the air gap. Magnetic
</p>
<p>field of such conductors passes through the air gap and encircles conductors of the
</p>
<p>stator, contributing to the magnetic coupling between stator and rotor windings.
</p>
<p>8.6.1 Axial Component of the Rotor Field
</p>
<p>It is proved in Sect. 8.3 that the axial component of the magnetic field is equal to
</p>
<p>zero in cylindrical machines with axially placed conductors. Since electrical
</p>
<p>currents exist in the conductors placed along z axis of the cylindrical coordinate
</p>
<p>system, there are no currents in tangential direction. As a consequence, the axial
</p>
<p>component of the magnetic field in the air gap is equal to zero. The analysis of
</p>
<p>circulation of the field along the contour shown in Fig. 8.5 shows that the axial
</p>
<p>component of the field in the air gap is equal to zero, notwithstanding the stator and
</p>
<p>rotor currents.
</p>
<p>8.6.2 Tangential Component of the Rotor Field
</p>
<p>Tangential component of the rotor magnetic field Hy
R is calculated in the air gap,
</p>
<p>next to the rotor magnetic circuit. The point of interest is in the air, and it resides on
</p>
<p>the boundary surface separating the rotor magnetic circuit and the air gap.
</p>
<p>The line integral of the magnetic field along the contour shown in Fig. 8.6 helps
</p>
<p>calculating the magnetic field in the vicinity of the boundary surface between the
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic material and the air gap. The tangential component of the field is
</p>
<p>determined by the line density of the surface currents in the boundary plane.
</p>
<p>Conclusions drawn from Fig. 8.6 can be applied to determining the tangential
</p>
<p>8.6 Components of Rotor Magnetic Field 177</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>field caused by the rotor currents. The field strength Hy
R is determined by the line
</p>
<p>current density JR(y) of the current sheet representing the rotor currents. This
</p>
<p>statement will be proved by using the example presented in Fig. 8.12.
</p>
<p>One should consider closed contour EFGH whose radial sides EF and GH are
</p>
<p>very short, while circular arcs FG and HE have approximately the same length RDy,
</p>
<p>where R is diameter of the rotor. Circular arc FG passes through the iron part of the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit, while circular arc HE passes through the air next to the rotor
</p>
<p>surface. Circulation of the vector of magnetic field along the closed contour EFGH
</p>
<p>is equal to the sum of all the currents passing through the surface leaning on the
</p>
<p>contour. In the considered case, there are rotor surface currents with line density
</p>
<p>JR(y). With Dy � p, it is justified to consider that the line current density does not
change along the circular arc HE; thus, the line integral of the magnetic field along
</p>
<p>the closed contour is equal to the product of JR(y) and the length of the arc HE:

</p>
<p>JR y&eth; &THORN;R d y � JR y&eth; &THORN; � R � Dy: (8.21)
</p>
<p>Since the sides EF and GH are very short, while the magnetic field in iron, along
</p>
<p>the arc FG, is very low, the line integral along the closed contour is reduced to the
</p>
<p>integral of the component Hy
R of the magnetic field in the air gap along the circular
</p>
<p>arc HE. With Dy � p, it is justified to assume that the field intensity Hy
R does not
</p>
<p>change along the considered arc, and the integral is reduced to

<p>direction of the tangential component of the stator field. For this reason, there is a

<p>8.6.3 Radial Component of the Rotor Field
</p>
<p>Radial component of the magnetic field in the air gap due to the rotor currents can
</p>
<p>be determined by calculating the line integral along the closed contour EFGH
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 8.13. The side EF of the contour extends in radial direction, at
</p>
<p>position y &frac14; ym, in the region with the maximum density of the rotor conductors
directed toward the reader. Position ym represents the angular displacement of the
</p>
<p>rotor, and it is measured with respect to the stator reference axis. The side EF of
</p>
<p>the contour starts from the stator magnetic circuit, it passes through the air gap in
</p>
<p>direction opposite to the reference direction, and it ends up in the rotor magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit. The side GH is directed radially at position y &frac14; y1. It starts from the
magnetic circuit of the rotor, passes through the air gap in direction aligned with
</p>

</p>
<p>the magnetic field caused
</p>
<p>by the rotor currents. Position
</p>
<p>ym corresponds to the rotor

<p>reference axis, while position
</p>
<p>y1 represents an arbitrary
</p>
<p>position where the radial

<p>component of the magnetic

<p>field is observed

<p>the reference radial direction, and it ends up in the stator magnetic circuit. The
</p>
<p>contour also comprises two circular arcs FG and HE of approximately the same
</p>
<p>length R(y1�ym), which pass through the magnetic circuits of the rotor and stator,
respectively. Since the magnetic field strength HFe in iron is very small, it can be
</p>
<p>assumed that the magnetic field has nonzero values only along the sides EF and GH,
</p>
<p>which pass through the air gap. At the same time, the air gap length is much smaller
</p>
<p>than the machine radius (d � R). Therefore, it is justified to assume that the radial
component of the magnetic field in the air gap does not exhibit significant changes
</p>
<p>along the sides EF and GH. With these assumptions, the circulation of the magnetic
</p>
<p>field along the contour becomes

</p>
<p>Circulation of the magnetic field along the closed contour is equal to the sum

<p>of all the currents passing through the surface encircled by the contour. In the
</p>
<p>case of the contour shown in Fig. 8.13, the sum of the currents passing through
</p>
<p>the contour is determined by calculating the integral of the line density JR(y) of

<p>For the purpose of deriving the radial component Hr
R(y1), it is necessary to
</p>
<p>determine the constant Hr
R(ym). In Sect. 8.3, where the calculation of the radial
</p>
<p>component of the stator magnetic field is carried out, it is shown that the average
</p>
<p>value of the radial component H(y) in the air gap must be equal to zero. The proof
</p>
<p>was based on the fact that the field of the vector of magnetic induction B cannot
</p>
<p>have a nonzero flux through a closed surface, such as the cylinder enveloping the
</p>
<p>rotor. Namely, div B &frac14; 0. Under circumstances, the same holds for the flux of the
vector H through the cylindrical surface passing through the air gap and enveloping
</p>
<p>the rotor. Therefore, the constant Hr
R(ym) in (8.26) must be equal to zero. Since the

<p>8.6.4 Survey of Components of the Rotor Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>In the preceding section, the air gap magnetic field caused by the rotor currents is
</p>
<p>analyzed, assuming that the rotor winding has axially placed conductors, wherein
</p>
<p>the conductor density changes along the circumference as a sinusoidal function,
</p>
<p>reaching the highest density at position ym, also called the reference axis of the rotor.
</p>
<p>With the electrical current i2 fed into the rotor conductors, the sheet of currents is
</p>
<p>formed on the rotor surface. The line density JR(y) of the surface currents exhibits
</p>
<p>the same sinusoidal change along the circumference as the density of the rotor
</p>
<p>conductors. The magnetic field is established in the air gap, while in iron, due to a
</p>
<p>very high-permeability mFe, the magnetic field HFe is negligible. In the cylindrical
</p>
<p>coordinate system, the axial component of the field H is zero, while the tangential
</p>
<p>and radial components are determined by the expressions (8.29) and (8.30):
</p>
<p>HRz &eth;y&THORN; &frac14; 0 (8.28)

sin&eth;y� ym&THORN; (8.30)
</p>
<p>The air gap d is considerably smaller than radius R of the machine; thus, the
</p>
<p>radial component of the field is much higher than the tangential component.
</p>
<p>Question (8.11): Consider a cylindrical machine of known dimensions, having the
same number of conductors on the stator and the rotor. It is known that each
</p>
<p>conductor of the stator has electrical current in direction �, while the rotor currents
across the air gap have the current of the same strength but in the opposite direction
</p>
<p>(�). Determine the magnetic field in the air gap.
</p>
<p>Answer (8.11): Since the air gap d is very small (d �R), the opposite conductors
of the stator and rotor are very close. Each stator conductor carrying the current
</p>
<p>in direction � has its counterpart across the air gap, the rotor conductor carrying
the current in the opposite direction �. The distance between the two is rather
small, d �R. For this reason, circulation of the magnetic field along the contour
EFGH, shown in Fig. 8.13, gets equal to zero, as the sum of electrical currents
</p>
<p>passing through the integration contour gets zero. Therefore, the radial compo-
</p>
<p>nent of the magnetic field is equal to zero across the air gap. Regarding tangential
</p>
<p>component, it should be noted that the opposite directions of the currents in stator
</p>
<p>and rotor conductors contribute to tangential components of vector H. This
</p>
<p>component is equal to the line density of the stator (or the rotor) sheet of surface
</p>
<p>currents.

<p>8.7 Convention of Representing Magnetic Field by Vector
</p>
<p>The subject of analysis in the preceding section was the magnetic field created by
</p>
<p>the rotor winding made out of series-connected conductors distributed sinusoidally
</p>
<p>along the rotor circumference. The left-hand part of Fig. 8.14 shows the lines of the
</p>
<p>radial field created by the rotor winding. The symbols � and � indicate positions
where the density of rotor conductors reaches its maximum. They also determine
</p>
<p>the reference axis of the rotor, which is perpendicular to the line� &ndash;� and which is
determined by the angle ym. The symbols� and� also indicate positions where the
line density of the rotor current sheet has its maximum. The magnetic field lines
</p>
<p>shown in the figure correspond to sinusoidal change of the magnetic field H along
</p>
<p>the air gap circumference. The area of the rotor surface where the field lines exit
</p>
<p>the rotor and enter the air gap is denoted as the north (N) magnetic pole. In a like
</p>
<p>manner, the south (S) magnetic pole is defined and marked as the area where the
</p>
<p>field gets from the air gap into the rotor. In central parts of magnetic poles, the field
</p>
<p>strength H and the magnetic induction B assume their maximum values.
</p>
<p>Magnetic field of the rotor winding can be represented in a concise way by
</p>
<p>introducing the vector of the rotor flux. Even though the flux is a directed scalar, it is
</p>
<p>possible to represent it as a vector by adding the course and direction to the scalar
</p>
<p>value.
</p>
<p>A flux vector is determined by its course, direction, and amplitude. Vector FR,
</p>
<p>shown in the right-hand side of Fig. 8.14, represents a sinusoidal distribution of the
</p>
<p>magnetic induction B, the field lines of which are shown in the left-hand side of
</p>
<p>the figure. Direction of the flux vector is in accordance with direction of the field
</p>
<p>lines of H and B &frac14; mH. The amplitude of the flux vectorFR is equal to the surface
integral of the vector B over the surface leaning on one turn of the rotor winding.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the flux vectorFR represents the flux in one turn. Alternatively, one can
</p>
<p>define the winding flux vector CR as the vector sum of all the fluxes in individual
</p>
<p>turns.

<p>Question (8.12): Behold the left side of Fig. 8.14 and the two rotor conductors
forming one rotor turn. Assume that these conductors are displaced several
</p>
<p>millimeters toward the stator and positioned across the air gap, on the inner surface
</p>
<p>of the stator magnetic circuit, while the electrical currents in these conductors
</p>
<p>remain the same. In the prescribed way, what used to be a rotor turn becomes a
</p>
<p>stator turn. Since the conductors denoted by � and � are now on the surface of the
stator magnetic circuit, the field created by the currents through these conductors
</p>
<p>becomes now the stator field. Sketch the field lines and compare them with the lines
</p>
<p>presented in the left-hand side of the figure. Denote positions of the north and south
</p>
<p>magnetic poles of the stator flux created by these conductors.
</p>
<p>Answer (8.12): Radial component of the magnetic field in the air gap will not
change by shifting the conductors. Direction of the tangential component of the
</p>
<p>field will change. Since radial component prevails over tangential component by an
</p>
<p>order of magnitude, it can be concluded that shifting the conductors will have no
</p>
<p>influence on the shape of the field lines. It is of interest to note that the north pole
</p>
<p>corresponds to the region where the magnetic field is directed from the magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit toward the air gap. In Fig. 8.14, the north pole of the stator is opposite to the
</p>
<p>south pole of the rotor.

</p>
<p>Energy, Flux, and Torque
</p>
<p>Magnetic field in the air gap is obtained from electrical currents in stator and rotor
</p>
<p>windings. Another source of the air gap field can be permanent magnets that may be
</p>
<p>placed within magnetic circuits of either stator or rotor. The stator and rotor fields in
</p>
<p>the air gap are calculated in the previous chapter. Interaction of the two fields incites
</p>
<p>the process of electromechanical conversion.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, expressions for the magnetic field in the air gap are used to
</p>
<p>calculate the field energy, to derive the energy accumulated in the magnetic field,
</p>
<p>and to calculate the electromagnetic torque caused by the interaction between the
</p>
<p>stator and rotor fields. In order to simplify the analysis, the flux linkages in one turns
</p>
<p>and the winding fluxes are represented by flux vectors. The concept of flux vector is
</p>
<p>introduced and explained along with magnetic axes of turns and windings. The
</p>
<p>torque expression is rewritten and expressed as the vector product of stator and rotor
</p>
<p>flux vectors. It is pointed out that continuous torque generation requires either stator
</p>
<p>or rotor windings to create the revolving magnetic field. This chapter ends with the
</p>
<p>analysis of two-phase windings systems and three-phase winding systems that
</p>
<p>create revolving magnetic field.
</p>
<p>9.1 Interaction of the Stator and Rotor Fields
</p>
<p>Electrical machines usually have windings on both stator and rotor. Currents
</p>
<p>through the windings create stator and rotor fluxes. There are machines which
</p>
<p>have permanent magnets instead of the stator or rotor winding. Magnetic field in
</p>
<p>the air gap has its radial and tangential components. The radial component is R/d
</p>
<p>times larger than the tangential. It determines the spatial distribution of the mag-
</p>
<p>netic energy of the field, as well as the course and direction of the field lines.
</p>
<p>The stator and rotor fields exist in the same air gap and the same magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit. They add up and make the resulting magnetic field and the resulting flux.
</p>
<p>Assuming that magnetic circuit is linear (m &frac14; const.), the resulting field is obtained
by superposition of stator and rotor fields. Namely, the strength of the resulting

<p>field is obtained by adding the two fields. The lines of the stator and rotor fields are
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 9.1, which presents the course and direction of relevant flux vectors
</p>
<p>and magnetic axes. It is assumed that both the stator and rotor have a number
</p>
<p>of sinusoidally distributed conductors. For clarity, Fig. 9.1 shows just a few
</p>
<p>conductors which denote distributed windings. Conductors S1 and S2 of the stator
</p>
<p>winding are placed in positions with the maximum density of the stator conductors.
</p>
<p>The normal of the stator turn S1&ndash;S2 is, at the same time, the magnetic axis of the
</p>
<p>stator winding. In the same way, the axis of the rotor winding is determined by
</p>
<p>the normal of the rotor turn R1&ndash;R2.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 9.1, direction of the stator field and flux is determined by normal nS of the
</p>
<p>stator turn S1&ndash;S2. This normal extends in direction shifted by p/2 with respect to
</p>
<p>position y &frac14; 0, where the density of the stator conductors reaches its maximum.
Direction of the rotor field and flux is determined by normal nR to the rotor turn
</p>
<p>R1&ndash;R2, which extends in direction shifted by p/2 with respect to position y &frac14; ym,
where the density of the rotor conductors reaches its maximum. For this reason,
</p>
<p>direction of the rotor flux is shifted by ym &thorn; p/2 with respect to position y &frac14; 0.
When the stator and rotor conductors have constant currents (DC currents), the
</p>
<p>stator flux vector remains in its position (vertical position in Fig. 9.1), while the rotor
</p>
<p>flux vector revolves along with the rotor. In this case, the angle between the two flux
</p>
<p>vectors is Dy &frac14; yS � yR &frac14; �ym, due to the rotor displacement of ym. In cases
where the stator and/or the rotor has two or more windings with alternating currents,
</p>
<p>the angle between the two flux vectors can be different than ym. Namely, a set of
</p>
<p>stator (rotor) windings with the proper orientation of their magnetic axes creates the
</p>
<p>magnetic field and the flux vector which revolve with respect to their originator.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For that to be achieved, the winding currents must have the appropriate frequency
</p>
<p>and the initial phases. Figure 7.9 shows an example where the two orthogonal stator
</p>
<p>windings with alternating currents create magnetic field which revolves with
</p>
<p>respect to the stator. In this case, position of the flux vector and the angular
</p>
<p>difference Dy between the two fluxes depend not only on the rotor position bus
</p>
<p>also on the supply frequency and the initial phase of the winding currents.
</p>
<p>Description and further analysis are facilitated by vector representation of the
</p>
<p>stator and rotor fields in the manner shown in Fig. 9.2. The field of the magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B can be represented by the flux vector, in accordance with conclusions
</p>
<p>presented in Sects. 4.4 and 5.5, as well as in Sect. 8.5, formulating the convention of
</p>
<p>vector representation of magnetic fields. Flux vector of one turn is obtained by
</p>
<p>associating the course and direction with scalar F. This course and direction is
</p>
<p>obtained from the unit vector of the normal to the surface encircled by the relevant
</p>
<p>turn. Figure 9.2 shows the flux vector of the turn S1&ndash;S2 and the flux vector of the
</p>
<p>turn R1&ndash;R2. These vectors represent the magnetic fields of the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 9.1. Scalar value FS represents the flux of the turn determined by the
</p>
<p>stator conductors S1&ndash;S2, placed in the region with maximum density of stator
</p>
<p>conductors. Vector FS has the course and direction obtained from the normal to
</p>
<p>the surface encircled by the turn S1&ndash;S2. The same way, scalar value FR represents
</p>
<p>the flux of the turn determined by the rotor conductors R1&ndash;R2, placed in the region
</p>
<p>with maximum density of rotor conductors. Vector FR has the course and direction
</p>
<p>obtained from the normal to the surface encircled by the turn R1&ndash;R2.
</p>
<p>By interaction of the stator and rotor magnetic fields, electromagnetic torque is
</p>
<p>created as a mechanical interaction between the stator and the rotor. Since the rotor
</p>
<p>can revolve, this torque can bring the rotor into rotation or change the speed of the
</p>
<p>rotor revolutions. The torque is created due to an interaction of the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic fields. Therefore, it is also called electromagnetic torque, Tem. Consider-

<p>ing the force of attraction between different magnetic poles, it can be concluded that
</p>
<p>the electromagnetic torque tends to move the rotor in a way that brings closer the
</p>
<p>north magnetic pole of the rotor and the south magnetic pole of the stator. The
</p>
<p>torque acts toward bringing the two opposite poles one against the other. In terms of
</p>
<p>the flux vectors, the electromagnetic torque tends to align the stator and rotor flux
</p>
<p>vectors. It will be shown further on that the electromagnetic torque can be expressed
</p>
<p>as the vector product of the stator and rotor flux vectors.

<p>Question (9.1): Assume that stator magnetic poles do not move with respect to the
stator. In addition, assume that rotor magnetic poles do not move with respect to
</p>
<p>the rotor. If the rotor revolves at a constant speed, what is the change of the torque
</p>
<p>acting on the rotor?
</p>
<p>Answer (9.1): In the considered case, the angle Dy between the flux vectors of the
stator and rotor is equal to the shift ym. If the rotor revolves at a constant speed,
</p>
<p>the variation of the created electromagnetic torque will be sinusoidal.
</p>
<p>9.2 Energy of Air Gap Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>It is of interest to determine the electromagnetic torque acting on the rotor and stator
</p>
<p>of a cylindrical machine. This torque can be determined as the first derivative of the
</p>
<p>energy accumulated in the magnetic (coupling) field in terms of the rotor displace-
</p>
<p>ment ym. On the basis of the equations given in Sect. 6.9, the increment of mechani-
</p>
<p>cal work dWmeh &frac14; Temdym is equal to the increment of energy of the magnetic field;
thus, the torque can be determined as the first derivative of the magnetic field energy
</p>
<p>in terms of the rotor shift ym, dWm/dym. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the
</p>
<p>energy of the magnetic field in terms of the rotor position, Wm(ym).
</p>
<p>The energy of the magnetic field can be calculated by integrating the density of
</p>
<p>the field energy wm over the entire domain where the magnetic field exists. The
</p>
<p>energy density wm is expressed in J/m
3, and it represents the amount of the field
</p>
<p>energy comprised within unit volume; thus, wm &frac14; DWm/DV &frac14; dWm/dV. Expres-
sion wm &frac14; &frac12; mH2 determines the density of the field energy in a linear medium,
where the magnetic permeability does not change. Therefore, the density of the
</p>
<p>field energy in the air gap is wm &frac14; &frac12;m0H2.
Magnetic field exists in the magnetic circuits of the stator and rotor which are
</p>
<p>made of iron, as well as in the air gap. Since the same magnetic flux which passes
</p>
<p>through the air gap gets into the stator and rotor magnetic circuits, magnetic
</p>
<p>induction in iron BFe and in the air gap B0 is roughly the same. The permeability
</p>
<p>of iron mFe is several orders of magnitude higher than the permeability of the air m0.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the magnetic field in iron HFe &frac14; BFe/mFe is negligible compared to the
fieldH0 in the air gap. The sameway, the density of the field energy in iron (&frac12;B
</p>
<p>2/mFe)
</p>
<p>is negligible when compared to the density of the field energy in the air gap (&frac12;B2/m0).
</p>
<p>For this reason, the overall energy of the magnetic field can be determined by
</p>
<p>integrating the density of the field energy (specific energy) over the whole domain
</p>
<p>of the air gap.
</p>
<p>In the expression for the field energy density wm &frac14; &frac12;m0H2, the symbol H
represents the strength of the resultant magnetic field in the air gap, namely, the
</p>
<p>sum of the stator and rotor fields. Since the tangential components of the magnetic
</p>
<p>field are negligible (d � R), the strength H of the resulting magnetic field in the air
gap is equal to the sum of radial components of the stator and rotor fields.

<p>It is important to recall that all previous considerations start with the assumptions

<p>that both stator and rotor windings carry DC currents; thus, the angleDy between the

As already mentioned, the stator and/or rotor may have several windings with

<p>9.3 Electromagnetic Torque
</p>
<p>The energy of the magnetic field in electrical machine shown in Fig. 9.1 is given by
</p>
<p>expression (9.4). Machine under consideration has one distributed winding on the
</p>
<p>stator and one distributed winding on the rotor. The windings carry constant (DC)
</p>
<p>currents. By using the expression for the field energy, it is possible to determine the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque.
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic torque is a measure of mechanical interaction between the
</p>
<p>stator and rotor. The torque of the same amplitude acts on both stator and rotor in
</p>
<p>different directions. Under conditions when the stator is fixed and does not move,
</p>
<p>the torque cannot make the stator turn. On the other hand, the rotor has the freedom
</p>
<p>to turn. Therefore, the torque can make the rotor revolve and/or it can alter the rotor
</p>
<p>speed. The angle ym denotes shift of the rotor with respect to the stator. Under
</p>
<p>circumstances, the angle ym also determines the shift between the two windings as
</p>
<p>well as the angle Dy between the stator and rotor flux vectors. Expression for
</p>
<p>the torque is Tem &frac14; &thorn;dWm/dym. It has positive sign due to the assumption that the
windings are connected to corresponding electrical power sources. Hence, consid-
</p>
<p>ered electrical machine acts as an electromechanical converter connected to the
</p>
<p>power source, hence the expression Tem &frac14; &thorn;dWm/dym. Moreover, it is assumed that
the stator and rotor windings are supplied from controllable current sources.
</p>
<p>Therefore, electrical currents in the windings do not depend on the rotor position
</p>
<p>ym. For this reason, the line densities of electrical currents JR0 and JS0 do not depend
</p>
<p>on the rotor position ym, and their first derivatives dJR0/dym and dJS0/dym are equal
</p>
<p>to zero. Under the circumstances, electrical currents do not change as the rotor
</p>
<p>moves by dym. For the purpose of calculating &thorn;dWm/dym, electrical currents can be
considered constant, resulting in Dy &frac14; �ym and cos(Dy) &frac14; cos(ym). Therefore,
expression for the electromagnetic torque becomes

</p>
<p>The sign of the obtained torque is negative. This means that the torque acts in
</p>
<p>direction which is opposite to the reference counterclockwise direction. In the
</p>
<p>preceding sections, electrical machine is presented in cylindrical coordinate system
</p>
<p>where z-axis is directed toward the reader (�). From the reader&rsquo;s viewpoint, the
reference direction of rotation around this axis is counterclockwise. The torque
</p>
<p>which supports the motion in counterclockwise direction can be represented as a
</p>
<p>vector collinear with z-axis. This association can be supported by the right-hand
</p>
<p>rule. The counterclockwise direction is adopted as the reference direction for the
</p>
<p>angular speed and torque. With that in mind, positive torque excites and supports
</p>
<p>the motion in counterclockwise (positive) direction. While the rotor revolves at a
</p>
<p>positive angular speed, a positive torque tends to increase the speed. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, torque of negative value excites and supports the motion in clockwise
</p>
<p>(negative) direction. While the rotor revolves at a positive angular speed, a negative
</p>
<p>torque tends to decrease the speed. The system in Fig. 9.1 tends to draw the north
</p>
<p>pole of the rotor toward the south pole of the stator and, hence, generates a negative
</p>
<p>torque, acting in clockwise direction.
</p>
<p>The torque in (9.7) is proportional to the product of the stator currents, the rotor
</p>
<p>currents, and the sine of the displacement ym. In the case under consideration, the
</p>
<p>stator and rotor currents are constant, DC currents. Therefore, position of the stator
</p>
<p>flux FS is determined by position of the stator. In other words, the stator flux does
</p>
<p>not move. At the same time, the position of the rotor flux FR is determined by the
</p>
<p>position of the rotor itself. Therefore, the stator and rotor flux vectors are displaced
</p>
<p>by ym. Hence, the torque is proportional to the sine of the angle between the two
</p>
<p>fluxes. With that in mind, there are good grounds for expressing the torque vector in
</p>
<p>terms of the vector product of the stator and rotor flux vectors. This statement will
</p>
<p>be proved in the subsequent sections.
</p>
<p>Question (9.2): Assume that the rotor is turning at a constant speed. What is the
average value of the torque in the case where the stator and rotor windings both
</p>
<p>have DC currents?
</p>
<p>Answer (9.2): The electromagnetic torque is a sinusoidal function of the angle
between the stator and rotor flux vectors. In cases with no change in the relative
</p>
<p>position of the two fluxes, this angle does not change, neither does the sine of
</p>
<p>192 9 Energy, Flux, and Torque</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the angle. Therefore, there are conditions for generating a constant, nonzero torque.
</p>
<p>If the angle between the two fluxes keeps changing at a constant rate, the electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic torque is sinusoidal function of time, and it has an average value equal to
</p>
<p>zero. In the given case, both windings have DC currents, and they generate the flux
</p>
<p>vectors which stay aligned with magnetic axes of corresponding windings. Since
</p>
<p>the rotor is turning, the rotor flux revolves with respect to the stator flux. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the average value of the torque will be equal to zero.
</p>
<p>9.3.1 The Torque Expression
</p>
<p>Equation (9.7) gives the electromagnetic torque of the electrical machine shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.1, whose windings carry DC currents. In all the cases where the windings
</p>
<p>have constant (DC) currents, position of the stator flux vector is determined by the
</p>
<p>position of the stator itself, while position of the rotor flux vector tracks the position
</p>
<p>of the rotor. Therefore, the angle Dy between the two vectors is equal to �ym.
In cases where the stator (or rotor) has a set of windings with alternating (AC)
</p>
<p>currents, position of the flux vector is not uniquely determined by position of the
</p>
<p>stator (rotor); it also depends on electrical currents in the windings. Under proper
</p>
<p>conditions, AC currents create rotating magnetic field, that is, the field which
</p>
<p>revolves with respect to the windings. Creation of rotating magnetic field is
</p>
<p>analyzed in detail in Section 9.9, Rotating magnetic field. It is of interest to
</p>
<p>calculate the electromagnetic torque in cases where the stator and/or rotor windings
</p>
<p>have AC currents and create rotating magnetic field.
</p>
<p>Starting from Figs. 9.1 and 9.2 and assuming that the windings carry DC
</p>
<p>currents, position of the stator flux vector yCS and position of the rotor flux vector

<p>The obtained expression shows that the torque is proportional to the product of

<p>amplitudes of the stator and rotor currents and to the sine of the angle between the
</p>
<p>stator and rotor flux vectors. The torque expression (9.8) holds notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>AC or DC currents in the machine windings. In order to show that the electromag-
</p>
<p>netic torque depends on the vector product of the stator and rotor flux vectors, it is
</p>
<p>necessary to probe further and clarify the relations between the single turn flux, the
</p>
<p>winding flux, and the amplitude of the flux vector.

<p>9.4 Turn Flux and Winding Flux
</p>
<p>In this section, some more detailed considerations concerning the winding flux and
</p>
<p>vector of the resultant flux are given.Algebraic intensity of the flux vector is calculated
</p>
<p>by relating the flux vector to the flux in one turn and the flux in thewinding. The goal of
</p>
<p>these efforts is to represent the electromagnetic torque as the vector product of the
</p>
<p>stator and rotor flux vectors.
</p>
<p>For the purpose of facilitating the analysis of electrical machines, directed
</p>
<p>scalars, such as magnetomotive forces and fluxes, can be represented by
</p>
<p>corresponding vectors. In Sect. 4.4, it is shown that the field of the vector of
</p>
<p>magnetic induction B can be represented by vector, thus defining the flux vector

<p>in a single turn (contour). In Sect. 5.5, the winding magnetic axis is introduced and
</p>
<p>defined, while Sect. 8.5 gives the convention of representing the magnetic field by
</p>
<p>vector. These results are used here to express the winding flux and the resultant flux.
</p>
<p>Magnetic field in electrical machines appears as a consequence of magnetomotive
</p>
<p>forces established by stator and rotor currents. An example of a machine having one
</p>
<p>stator and one rotor winding is given in Fig. 9.1. In this example, it is assumed that
</p>
<p>electrical currents in both windings are constant and that the magnetic circuit is
</p>
<p>linear. Not all of the conductors are shown in the Fig. 9.1. It is understood that a
</p>
<p>number of stator and rotor conductors are distributed along the machine circumfer-
</p>
<p>ence and that their line density changes in a sinusoidal manner. The stator magnetic
</p>
<p>field is caused by the stator currents and shown in the left of Fig. 9.1. The rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic field is caused by the rotor currents, and it is shown in the right. The
</p>
<p>resultant flux is obtained by superposition, that is, by adding the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>fields and fluxes. At any point in the air gap, it is possible to identify the vector of the
</p>
<p>magnetic induction BS created by stator currents and the vector of the magnetic
</p>
<p>induction BR created by rotor currents. Resultant magnetic induction BRes is equal to
</p>
<p>the vector sum BS &thorn; BR. The stator flux is calculated as a surface integral of the
vector BS, while the rotor flux is the surface integral of the vector BR. The resultant
</p>
<p>flux is the surface integral of the vector BS &thorn; BR. Therefore, the resultant flux vector
is the vector sum of the rotor flux vector and the stator flux vector.
</p>
<p>At this point, it is of interest to clarify the terms stator flux and rotor flux. Within
</p>
<p>further developments, the references to stator flux imply the flux created by
</p>
<p>magnetomotive forces of stator currents. In cases where the rotor does not have
</p>
<p>any electrical currents in its windings nor does it comprise permanent magnets, the
</p>
<p>only flux in electrical machine is the stator flux. In absence of rotor currents,
</p>
<p>magnetic inductance BR, created in the air gap by means of the rotor currents, is
</p>
<p>equal to zero. In such conditions, the resultant magnetic induction is equal to BS.
</p>
<p>The stator flux in one turn is determined by the surface integral of the vector BS over
</p>
<p>the surface S encircled by the turn. In the same way, all the developments within
</p>
<p>this book consider the rotor flux as the surface integral of the magnetic induction
</p>
<p>BR, wherein the induction BR is created by the rotor currents and corresponds to the
</p>
<p>resultant induction in cases where the stator currents are equal to zero. The resultant
</p>
<p>magnetic induction BRes &frac14; BS &thorn; BR exists in the machine with both the stator and
rotor currents. The resultant flux is the surface integral of the vector BRes.
</p>
<p>One can consider the term stator flux to be the flux in the stator winding, whatever
</p>
<p>the magnetomotive force incites the flux. Adopting this viewpoint, the stator flux can
</p>
<p>be created by the stator currents, by the rotor currents, or by the contemporary action
</p>
<p>of both currents. This meaning of the term is better explained by citing resulting
</p>
<p>stator flux, implying the resultant flux in the stator winding, caused by any
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force and whatever magnetic inductance. The same holds for the
</p>
<p>term rotor flux.
</p>
<p>Flux in one turn (contour) is determined as the surface integral of the vector of
magnetic induction B over the surface encircled by the contour. The reference
</p>
<p>direction to be respected in the course of integration is determined by the right-hand
</p>
<p>rule. Placing the right hand so that the four fingers point to direction � (Fig. 9.3),

direction of the contour flux. A positive current in the contour will create positive

<p>flux. The field lines would extend in the reference course and direction.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 9.3, one stator turn with conductors S1 and S2 has electrical current that
</p>
<p>creates magnetic field in the air gap. The arrows indicate the course and direction of

<p>the magnetic induction B in the air gap. The flux in the turn is determined by
</p>
<p>calculating surface integral of the vector B induction over the surface encircled
</p>
<p>by the turn S1&ndash;S2. There is a multitude of different surfaces that are all
</p>
<p>surrounded by the turn S1&ndash;S2. Due to divB &frac14; 0, the flux of the vector B on all
such surfaces has the same value. Therefore, the flux calculation can be performed
</p>
<p>by selecting the surface that leads to less difficulty in calculation of the surface
</p>
<p>integral. This surface may be a rectangle D � L, with one side being the diameter
S1&ndash;S2 and the other side being the axial length L of the machine. However,
</p>
<p>analytical expression for the magnetic induction B is unknown along the diameter
</p>

<p>turn S1&ndash;S2 is a part of the stator winding. It is connected in series with a multitude

<p>9.4.2 Flux in One Rotor Turn
</p>
<p>Preceding analysis calculates the flux in one stator turn. In a similar way, it is
</p>
<p>possible to obtain the flux in one rotor turn, namely, the flux in the contour R1&ndash;R2
</p>
<p>of the rotor winding (Fig. 9.1). In calculating the surface integral of the magnetic
</p>

</p>
<p>Calculation of the flux in one turn may be done in a shorter way, avoiding the
</p>
<p>integration. Magnetic inductance Br passes through the semicylindrical surface
</p>
<p>S &frac14; pRL in radial direction. In cases where the magnetic inductance BrS(y) does
not change over the interval y &isin; [0 .. p], the flux in one stator turn can be obtained
</p>
<p>by multiplying the inductance Br
S(y) &frac14; const. and the surface area pRL. Yet, in
</p>
<p>electrical machine with sinusoidally distributed conductors, magnetic inductance
</p>
<p>changes along the circumference. Both Br
S(y) and Br
</p>
<p>R(y) change as sinusoidal
</p>
<p>functions of the angle y. Notwithstanding variable magnetic inductance in the air
</p>
<p>gap, the surface integration can be avoided in all cases where the average value of
</p>
<p>Br(y) is known on one semicircle. The flux FS1 in the stator turn S1&ndash;S2 can be
</p>
<p>calculated as the product of the surface pRL of the semicylinder and the average
</p>
<p>value of the magnetic induction Br
S(y) over the interval y &isin; [0 .. p]. With Br
</p>
<p>S(y)
</p>
<p>&frac14; Bmax sin(y), the average value is p/2 times lower than the maximum value; thus,
Bav &frac14; (2/p) Bmax &frac14; 2m0RJS0/(dp). The result FS1 is obtained by multiplying the
average value Bav of the magnetic induction and the surface area S &frac14; pRL, and it is
in accordance with (9.9).
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the contours S1&ndash;S2 and R1&ndash;R2 have been selected so as
</p>
<p>to have their conductors placed in the regions with the highest density of
</p>
<p>conductors. The stator flux vector is shown in Fig. 9.1, and it coincides with the
</p>
<p>normal on the contour. Other turns have their conductors displaced with respect to
</p>
<p>S1&ndash;S2, and their normals are inclined with respect to the stator flux vector. Namely,
</p>
<p>the lines of the stator magnetic fields pass through the inclined turns at an angle
</p>
<p>other than p/2. Therefore, the flux in other turns is smaller than the flux in the turn
</p>
<p>198 9 Energy, Flux, and Torque</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>S1&ndash;S2. As the angular displacement of the turn with respect to S1&ndash;S2 increases
</p>
<p>toward p/2, the flux decreases.
</p>
<p>In the sameway, the rotor flux vector, shown in Fig. 9.1, coincideswith the normal
</p>
<p>to the contour R1&ndash;R2. Therefore, the flux in the turn R1&ndash;R2 has the maximum value
</p>
<p>of all rotor turns.
</p>
<p>The flux in turns that are inclined with respect to S1&ndash;S2 (R1&ndash;R2) is smaller
</p>
<p>compared to the values given by (9.9) and (9.10). It is shown hereafter that this flux
</p>
<p>depends on the cosine of the angle between the flux vector and the normal on the
</p>
<p>relevant turn. As an example, the flux is calculated in one stator turn with conductor
</p>
<p>� in position y &frac14; y1 and conductor � in position y &frac14; p &thorn; y1. The normal on the
considered turn is shifted by y1 with respect to the normal on the turn S1&ndash;S2.
</p>
<p>The fluxFS(y1) in the inclined turn is determined by calculating the surface integral
</p>
<p>of the magnetic induction (incited by the stator currents) over the semicylindrical

<p>surface reclining on the conductor � in position y &frac14; y1 and reaching the conductor

<p>Equation (9.11) shows that flux in the turn shifted by angle y1 is cosine function

<p>of the angle. When y1 &gt; p/2, the flux in this turn obtains negative value. With
y1 &frac14; p, the turn gets to positions S1 and S2, with directions � and � exchanged.
The flux in such turn reaches the same absolute value as the flux in the original turn
</p>
<p>S1&ndash;S2, but it has the opposite sign. In the same way, it can be shown that the flux
</p>
<p>created by the rotor currents in one rotor turn depends on the angle y2 between the
</p>
<p>normal on the considered turn (contour) and the vertical nR on the turn R1&ndash;R2
</p>
<p>(Fig. 9.1). The flux in the rotor turn FR(y2) is calculated from the surface integral of
</p>
<p>the rotor magnetic induction over the surface encircled by the conductor � in
position y &frac14; ym &thorn; y2 and the conductor � in position y &frac14; p &thorn; ym &thorn; y2 (9.12).

<p>9.4.3 Winding Flux
</p>
<p>Flux in a winding is the sum of fluxes in individual turns constituting the winding.
</p>
<p>A sample winding consisting of N series connected turns wound around a straight
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic bar is given in Fig. 9.4. Each turn of the sample winding has the same
</p>
<p>fluxF. Therefore, the total flux of the whole windingC is determined as the product
</p>
<p>of the number of turns N and the flux of one turn F; thus, C &frac14; NF. This is due to
the fact that the surfaces encircled by individual turns have equal areas while their
</p>
<p>normals are oriented in the same direction. A winding where all the turns have the
</p>
<p>same flux while their normals are collinear is called concentrated winding.
</p>
<p>Like the flux in one turn, the flux in a winding can be determined as surface
</p>
<p>integral of the magnetic induction over the surface reclining on the entire winding.
</p>
<p>While the surface encircled by one turn is easily identified, the surface of the
</p>
<p>winding is more difficult to identify. In Fig. 9.5, an attempt is made to illustrate
</p>
<p>the surface of a concentrated winding. The three turns making this winding consti-
</p>
<p>tute a complex contour. The shadowed area shows the surface encircled by the
</p>

<p>winding conductors. If distance between the turns is sufficiently small, it is justified
</p>
<p>to assume that the three turns have the same flux. Therefore, each of the lines of the
</p>
<p>considered magnetic field passes through the surface of the winding three times.
</p>
<p>With F designating the flux in one turn, the winding flux C is equal to NF &frac14; 3F.
In a cylindrical machine with distributed windings, the stator and rotor turns are
</p>
<p>distributed along the circumference. The stator conductors are placed in slots on
</p>
<p>the inner surface of the stator magnetic circuit, while the rotor conductors are
</p>
<p>placed in slots on the rotor surface facing the air gap. Two diametrical conductors
</p>
<p>constitute one turn, that is, one contour. A winding consists of a number of series
</p>
<p>connected turns. The winding flux is the sum of the fluxes in individual turns. The
</p>
<p>flux in one turn depends upon its relative position with respect to the magnetic field.
</p>
<p>In cases where the field lines are perpendicular to the surface of the turn, the flux in
</p>
<p>the turn has maximum value. The flux becomes zero in cases where the turn surface
</p>
<p>runs parallel with the lines of the magnetic field.
</p>
<p>It is proven that the flux in one turn is proportional to the cosine of the angle
</p>
<p>between the vector of magnetic induction and the normal on the turn surface. This
</p>
<p>normal is called magnetic axis of the turn. In Fig. 9.1, the normal is perpendicular to
</p>
<p>the straight line connecting the conductors � and �. Given the orientation of the
magnetic field, the flux F(y) in each turn can be determined in terms of its angular
</p>
<p>position y. Equations (9.11) and (9.12) provide the flux values for one stator and one
</p>
<p>rotor turn. They are expressed in terms of the angle between the normal of the
</p>
<p>relevant turn and the flux vector which represents the magnetic field.
</p>
<p>Since the turns that constitute one distributed winding have their axes oriented in
</p>
<p>different directions, their relevant fluxes will assume different values. For this
</p>
<p>reason, the total winding flux cannot be obtained by multiplying the flux in one
</p>

</p>
<p>In general, the winding flux is determined by adding all the contributions of
</p>
<p>individual turns. In cases where the winding is concentrated, the winding flux
</p>
<p>vector has an amplitude of C &frac14; NF. In cases where the winding is distributed
with the conductor line density of N0(y), the winding flux is determined by integra-
tion. The number of conductors within a tiny segment of angular width dy is
</p>
<p>dN &frac14; N 0 y&eth; &THORN;Rdy;
</p>
<p>where R is diameter of the machine. Each of the conductors positioned on the
</p>
<p>interval y&isin; [0 .. p] completes one turn with its diametrically positioned counterpart
</p>
<p>on the interval y&isin; [p .. 2p]. The flux in one turn is determined by the angle between
</p>
<p>the flux vector, representing the magnetic field and the axis of the turn. Eventually,
</p>
<p>the flux in one turn can be expressed in terms of the position y of the turn.

</p>
<p>Equation (9.13) can be used for calculation of the winding fluxes of both stator
</p>
<p>and rotor windings.
</p>
<p>An example of practical use of the (9.13) is calculation of the self-inductance of
</p>
<p>the stator winding. Self-inductance is coefficient that defines effect of winding
</p>
<p>currents on winding flux. In cases where the winding flux C does not have any
</p>
<p>external originator and exists due to the winding current I only, the self-inductance
</p>
<p>can be calculated as LS &frac14; C/I. Before using (9.13), it is necessary to calculate the
flux in one turn F(y). It is calculated as the surface integral of the magnetic
</p>
<p>induction Br
S in the air gap, wherein Br
</p>
<p>S denotes the radial component of the
</p>
<p>magnetic inductance created by the stator currents. Dividing the flux in the stator
</p>
<p>winding by the stator current I gives the self-inductance of the stator winding.
</p>
<p>Similar procedure can be used to determine the mutual inductance between the
</p>
<p>stator and rotor windings. The mutual inductance Lm defines the effect of the rotor
</p>
<p>currents on the flux in the stator winding. In cases where the rotor currents contribute
</p>
<p>to resultant magnetic induction in the air gap, they also change the resultant flux in
</p>
<p>the stator turns and, hence, the flux in the stator winding. The same coefficient
</p>
<p>defines the effects of the stator currents on the flux in the rotor winding. Calculation
</p>
<p>of Lm requires the previous procedure to be modified. When calculating the flux in
</p>
<p>one stator turn F(y), it is necessary to replace the magnetic inductance Br
S, created
</p>
<p>by the stator currents, by the magnetic inductance Br
R, created by the rotor currents.
</p>
<p>In this way, the value ofF(y) corresponds to the flux that the rotor currents establish
</p>
<p>in one stator turn. At that time, calculation of the stator flux according to (9.13)
</p>
<p>results in the flux created in the stator winding by action of the rotor currents.
</p>
<p>Dividing this value by the rotor current gives coefficient of mutual inductance
</p>
<p>between stator and rotor windings.
</p>
<p>To proceed, the flux in the stator winding of the electrical machine shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.1 is calculated by using (9.13), assuming that the magnetic field in the air gap
</p>
<p>is excited by the stator currents. Therefore, the magnetic field in the air gap is
</p>
<p>calculated assuming that the rotor currents are equal to zero. Distributed winding of
</p>
<p>the stator can be considered as a set of NT &frac14; NC/2 contours, where NC denotes the
number of conductors in the stator winding while NT is the number of turns.
</p>
<p>According to (8.2), the number of turns is equal to NT &frac14; 2R N0Smax, where N0Smax
is the maximum line density of the stator conductors, which exists at positions of
</p>
<p>conductors S1 and S2 in Fig. 9.1.
</p>
<p>In order to calculate the winding flux, it is necessary to calculate the flux in one
</p>
<p>turn. For a turn with conductor � in position y and with conductor � in position
p &thorn; y, the flux FS(y) is determined from (9.11):

NTFS1: (9.14)
</p>
<p>With p/4 &lt; 1, it is concluded from (9.14) that the flux in a distributed winding
is smaller than the flux in a concentrated winding having the same number of turns.
</p>
<p>A concentrated winding would be obtained by placing all the conductors in places
</p>
<p>S1 and S2 (Fig. 9.1). The flux in the concentrated winding is obtained by
</p>
<p>multiplying the number of turns NT and the flux in one turn FS1.
</p>
<p>9.4.4 Winding Flux Vector
</p>
<p>The winding flux can be represented by a vector denoting the course, direction, and
</p>
<p>amplitude of the flux. The winding flux vector can be obtained by adding the flux
</p>
<p>vectors representing the fluxes in individual turns. In cases where the flux vectors of
</p>
<p>individual turns have different orientations, it is necessary to determine their sum
</p>
<p>and find the course and direction for the flux vector of the winding.
</p>
<p>The convention of representing the flux in one turn by vector is presented in
</p>
<p>Section 4.4. The course and direction of the flux vector in one turn are determined
</p>
<p>from the normal to the surface reclining on the relevant turn. In Sect. 5.5, magnetic
</p>
<p>axis of a winding has been defined on the basis of the course and direction of the
</p>
<p>lines representing the magnetic field created by electrical currents in the winding
</p>
<p>itself. The course of the winding axis is determined by positions of magnetic poles
</p>
<p>created in the magnetic circuit due to the winding currents. The convention of
</p>
<p>representing the magnetic field of a distributed winding by flux vector is given in
</p>
<p>Sect. 8.5. Once again, the course and direction of the flux vector are determined
</p>
<p>from spatial orientation of the magnetic field, that is, from positions of the magnetic
</p>
<p>poles. Practical example of calculating the course and direction of the flux vector is
</p>
<p>given for the machine presented in Fig. 9.1. It starts with determining the spatial
</p>
<p>distribution of the magnetic field created by the currents in distributed winding.
</p>
<p>Direction of the winding flux vector is determined on the basis of direction of the

<p>field lines, while the course is determined by the magnetic poles, wherein the poles
</p>
<p>are identified as diametrically positioned zones of the magnetic circuit where the
</p>
<p>magnetic induction reaches maximum values. By using this procedure, magnetic
</p>
<p>fields of the stator and rotor have been represented by flux vectors given in Fig. 9.2.
</p>
<p>Derivation of the course of the flux vector and the magnetic axis of the winding
</p>
<p>can be performed otherwise, by vector addition of magnetomotive forces created by
</p>
<p>individual turns or by vector addition of their flux vectors. Figure 9.6 shows a stator
</p>
<p>winding comprising three turns, A1&ndash;A2, B1&ndash;B2, and C1&ndash;C2. The upper part of the
</p>
<p>figure shows individual vectors of magnetomotive forces for each turn. These
</p>
<p>magnetomotive forces are denoted by vectors FA, FB, and FC. They are determined
</p>
<p>by the normals of corresponding turns. Magnetomotive force FA would determine
</p>
<p>the course and direction of the resultant winding flux if the turns B and C did not
</p>
<p>exist. The resultant magnetomotive force FS of the stator winding comprising all the
</p>
<p>three turns is shown in the lower part of the figure. The vector of the resultant
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force is obtained by vector addition of FA, FB, and FC. Since each
</p>
<p>flux is determined by dividing the corresponding magnetomotive force by the
</p>
<p>magnetic resistance, the course and direction of the vector representing the flux in
</p>
<p>the winding are determined from the resultant magnetomotive force. As it is shown
</p>
<p>in the figure, the flux vector of the winding is collinear with the normal of the
</p>
<p>middle turn A1&ndash;A2.

<p>9.5 Winding Axis and Flux Vector
</p>
<p>Previous considerations provided details on determining the axis of a winding, the
</p>
<p>course of the flux vector in one turn, and the course of the flux vector in a winding
</p>
<p>comprising several turns. A brief survey of the conclusions is presented hereafter,
</p>
<p>aimed to be used in the subsequent considerations. The survey is illustrated by
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.7.
</p>
<p>The figure presents a distributed winding with sinusoidal change of the conductor
</p>
<p>line density. The maximum line density is reached at positions where the conductors
</p>
<p>A1 and A2 are placed. The maximum value FS1 of the flux in one turn is reached in
</p>
<p>the turn A1&ndash;A2.
</p>
<p>The course of the flux FS1 in the turn A1&ndash;A2 is determined by the normal nS1.
</p>
<p>The normal nS1 is a unit vector perpendicular to the flat surface reclining on the
</p>
<p>contour A1&ndash;A2.
</p>
<p>The course of the stator winding flux vectorCS is determined by the unit vector
</p>
<p>nS, representing the winding axis (magnetic axis of the winding). Therefore, in the
</p>
<p>case of a distributed winding with sinusoidal distribution of conductors, the flux
</p>
<p>vector and the winding axis have the same course and direction as the flux vector
</p>
<p>FS1 in the turn A1&ndash;A2, wherein the conductors A1 and A2 reside at positions where
</p>
<p>the conductor line density is maximum.

</p>

</p>
<p>field of the rotor in a cylindrical electrical machine with DC currents in both
</p>
<p>windings. Electromagnetic torque is generated by interaction of the two magnetic

<p>fields, and it is expressed by (9.7), where the angle ym represents the position of the
</p>
<p>rotor relative to the stator. With DC currents in the windings, the angle ym defines as
</p>
<p>well the angle between the stator and rotor flux vectors.
</p>
<p>In general, both stator and rotor may comprise several windings carrying DC or
</p>
<p>AC currents. Alternating currents may create rotating magnetic field which can be
</p>
<p>represented by a revolving flux vector. Such field revolves relative to the windings
</p>
<p>that give rise to the magnetomotive forces that originate the field. In cases where AC
</p>
<p>currents in the stator windings create rotating magnetic field, the orientation of the
</p>
<p>stator flux vector yCS depends on instantaneous values of electrical currents in
</p>
<p>the stator windings. In cases where AC currents in the rotor create rotating magnetic
</p>
<p>field, instantaneous values of the rotor currents determine the position of the rotor
</p>
<p>flux vector with respect to the rotor. Hence, the orientation of the rotor flux vector
</p>
<p>yCR with respect to the stator is determined by the rotor position ym and by
</p>
<p>instantaneous values of electrical currents in the rotor winding. Therefore, in
</p>
<p>general, the angle Dy &frac14; yCS � yCR between the stator flux vector and the rotor
flux vector is dependent on the rotor position ym and also on instantaneous values of
</p>
<p>electrical currents in the machine windings, as indicated in Fig. 9.8. On the basis

<p>Question (9.3): Expression for the torque (9.7) has the leading minus sign. Should
the torque of a negative value be expected in the case represented in Fig. 9.1? Why
</p>
<p>(9.15) does not include negative sign?
</p>
<p>Answer (9.3): The electromagnetic torque is determined by the function sin Dy,
where Dy is the angle equal to yCS � yCR. The angles yCS and yCR determine the
course of the stator and rotor flux vectors. In Fig. 9.1, courses of the two flux vectors
</p>
<p>are shown assuming that the windings carry a constant DC current. Then yCS &frac14; p/2,
while yCR &frac14; p/2 &thorn; ym, resulting inDy &frac14; �ym. In the considered case, the torque is
proportional to function sin Dy &frac14; �sin ym, which gives the minus sign in (9.7).
</p>
<p>9.7 Conditions for Torque Generation
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic torque can be calculated from the vector product of the flux
</p>
<p>vector FS1 and the flux vector FR1, wherein the former is created by the stator
</p>
<p>currents in the stator turn S1&ndash;S2 while the latter is created by the rotor currents in
</p>
<p>the turn R1&ndash;R2 (Fig. 9.1). The expression for the electromagnetic torque is given by
</p>
<p>(9.17). Equation (9.18) reformulates the expression by introducing the vector
</p>
<p>product of the stator flux vector and the rotor flux vector.
</p>
<p>The torque is proportional to the sine of the angle Dy between the relevant flux
</p>
<p>vectors. With DC currents in both the stator and the rotor windings, the stator
</p>
<p>flux does not move with respect to the stator while the rotor flux does not move with
</p>
<p>respect to the rotor. In this case, the stator flux is leading with respect to the rotor
</p>
<p>flux by Dy &frac14; �ym.
With the rotor revolving at a constant angular speed Om, and with the initial rotor
</p>
<p>position ym(0) &frac14; 0, the rotor position changes as ym(t) &frac14; Omt. Therefore, the angle
between the stator flux vector and the rotor flux vector is Dy &frac14; �ym &frac14; �Omt.
</p>
<p>208 9 Energy, Flux, and Torque</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Hence, electrical machine with both stator and rotor windings carrying DC current
</p>
<p>develops electromagnetic torque proportional to sin(Omt). The average value of this
</p>
<p>torque and the average value of the corresponding conversion power Pem &frac14; Tem Om
are both equal to zero. Therefore, an electrical machine with DC currents in the
</p>
<p>stator and in the rotor windings cannot provide an average power other than zero.
</p>
<p>A nonzero average value of the torque is obtained in cases where the angle Dy
</p>
<p>between the stator and rotor flux vectors is constant. For the given winding currents,
</p>
<p>the electromagnetic torque has the maximum value with Dy &frac14; p/2.
Condition Dy &frac14; const. cannot be achieved with both the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>windings carrying DC currents. It will be proven later on that at least one of the
</p>
<p>windings on either stator or rotor must have AC currents and create the revolving
</p>
<p>magnetic field. There are three distinct cases when the constraint Dy &frac14; const. is
fulfilled. These three methods of accomplishing constant relative position of the
</p>
<p>two flux vectors have been shown in Fig. 7.8. These examples are reinstated
</p>
<p>hereafter and explained again in terms of the flux vectors.
</p>
<p>It is of interest to notice that a nonzero average value of the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque is achieved only in cases where the angle Dy &frac14; yCS � yCR is constant.
Namely, the stator and rotor flux vectorsmust retain their relative position. Whether
</p>
<p>they revolve or stay firm, the angle between flux vectors representing the stator and
</p>
<p>rotor magnetic fields must not change. There are three cases where this condition is
</p>
<p>fulfilled:
</p>
<p>(a) Stator field is still with respect to stator. Rotor field rotates with respect to rotor
</p>
<p>in the opposite direction of rotation of rotor; thus, rotor field does not move with
</p>
<p>respect to stator.
</p>
<p>(b) Stator field rotates with respect to stator. Rotor field rotates with respect to
</p>
<p>rotor. Sum of rotor speed relative to stator and rotor field speed relative to rotor
</p>
<p>is equal to speed of rotation of stator field relative to stator.
</p>
<p>(c) Stator field rotates with respect to stator at speed equal to rotor speed. Rotor
</p>
<p>field does not move with respect to rotor.
</p>
<p>Generation of stator or rotor magnetic field which does not rotate with respect to
</p>
<p>originating windings can be done by one or more windings with DC currents.
</p>
<p>Generation of the field that revolves with respect to originating windings requires
</p>
<p>at least two windings of different spatial orientation and with AC currents of the
</p>
<p>appropriate frequency and initial phase. Conditions for creation of a rotating field
</p>
<p>have been discussed in the section devoted to rotating field.
</p>
<p>Case (a) corresponds to direct current machines (DCmachines), and it is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.8a. Vector of the stator flux does not move with respect to the stator because
</p>
<p>the stator conductors have constant DC currents. The torque generation requires the
</p>
<p>rotor flux to retain its relative position to the stator flux. This means that the rotor flux
</p>
<p>vector in Fig. 7.8a should not move either. For the rotor flux vector to remain still
</p>
<p>while the rotor windings revolve, electrical currents in rotor conductors should
</p>
<p>create magnetic field which rotates with respect to the rotor at the speed �Om.
In this case, the rotor revolves in positive direction at the speed&thorn;Om, while the rotor
flux revolves with respect to the rotor in the opposite direction. Therefore, the

<p>rotor flux remains still with respect to the stator. For the rotor windings to create
</p>
<p>revolving field, the rotor must have AC currents, the frequency of which is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the speed of rotation. Yet, DC machines are supplied from DC power
</p>
<p>sources. In order to convert DC supply currents into AC rotor currents, DCmachines
</p>
<p>have a mechanical commutator, device with brushes attached to the stator and
</p>
<p>collector attached to the rotor. Collector has a number of isolated segments,
</p>
<p>connected to the rotor conductors. When the rotor revolves, the segments slide
</p>
<p>under the brushes, altering electrical connections and changing the way of injecting
</p>
<p>the supply current into the rotor winding. In such way, commutator directs DC
</p>
<p>current of the electrical power source into rotor conductors in such way that the rotor
</p>
<p>conductors have AC currents. The frequency of these currents is determined by the
</p>
<p>speed of rotation. The commutator will be explained in more detail in the chapter on
</p>
<p>DC machines. Thanks to the commutator, the flux vector FR1 remains still with
</p>
<p>respect to flux vector FS1; thus, the angle Dy remains constant.
</p>
<p>Case (b) shown in Fig. 7.8b corresponds to asynchronous machines. Windings of
</p>
<p>the stator and rotor have AC currents of angular frequency os and ok, respectively.
</p>
<p>The stator flux vector rotates with respect to the stator at the speed Os, determined by
</p>
<p>the angular frequency os. The rotor flux vector rotates with respect to the rotor at the
</p>
<p>speed ofOk, determined by the angular frequency ok. Difference os � ok in angular
frequency determines the rotor speedOm. The flux vectors of the stator and rotor rotate
</p>
<p>at the same speed (Os). Consequently, their mutual position Dy does not change.
</p>
<p>Case (c) shown in Fig. 7.8c corresponds to synchronousmachines. There are rotor
</p>
<p>windings with constant DC currents producing the rotor flux. Alternatively, the rotor
</p>
<p>does not have any windings. Instead, there are permanent magnets mounted on the
</p>
<p>rotor. In either case, the rotor flux vector FR1 rotates at the same speed as the rotor
</p>
<p>does. The stator of the machine has a system of windings with two or more phases
</p>
<p>carrying AC currents. Angular frequency os of the stator currents creates the stator
</p>
<p>magnetic field which revolves at the speed Os, determined by the angular frequency
</p>
<p>os of the stator currents. In synchronous machines, the stator frequency ensures that
</p>
<p>the field rotates at the same speed as the rotor, that is, Os &frac14; Om. Therefore, the flux
vectors FR1 and FS1 rotate at the same speed, and their mutual position Dy does
</p>
<p>not change.

<p>Question (9.4): Derive the expression for the torque acting on a contour with
electrical current in a homogenous magnetic field, with the normal to the contour

<p>Answer (9.4): The electromagnetic torque Tem acting on the contour is equal to
I�B�S�siny. When the contour rotates at angular speed O while both the current and
magnetic inductance are constant, the torque varies according to function sin(O t),
</p>
<p>and its average value is zero. In cases where the magnetic induction is constant
</p>
<p>while the current i(t) &frac14; I sin(ot) changes with angular frequency o equal to the
speed of rotation O, the torque is proportional to (sin(ot))2 and has a nonzero
</p>
<p>average value. If the contour has a constant current I, nonzero average of the torque
</p>
<p>can be obtained in cases when the magnetic induction changes as B(t) &frac14; Bm�
sin(ot), where the angular frequency o corresponds to the speed of rotation O.
</p>
<p>9.8 Torque&ndash;Size Relation
</p>
<p>Expression for electromagnetic torque (9.16) shows that the torque is proportional
</p>
<p>to R3L, that is, to the axial length of the machine L and third power of its diameterD.
</p>
<p>Diameter and axial length are linear dimensions of the machine, and common
</p>
<p>notation l can be used for both. Therefore, the electromagnetic torque is propor-
</p>
<p>tional to fourth power of the linear dimensions l of the machine, T ~ l4. Volume of
</p>
<p>the machine is proportional to the third power of linear dimensions, V ~ l3. There-
</p>
<p>fore, the torque is proportional to T ~ V4/3.
</p>
<p>Electrical machines are made of iron and copper, materials of known specific
</p>
<p>masses.1 Therefore, the mass m of an electrical machine is determined by the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque for which it has been designed. The mass m and torque T
</p>
<p>are related by T ~ m4/3. As an example, a new machine with all the three
</p>
<p>dimensions doubled with respect to the original machine develops electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque increase 24 &frac14; 16 times.
Relation T ~ m4/3 can be verified in another way. It has been proven that the
</p>
<p>torque can be expressed as vector product of two flux vectors. The flux amplitude
</p>
<p>depends on the surface (S ~ l2) and magnetic induction (B &lt; Bmax), the latter being
limited by magnetic saturation of the ferromagnetic material and not exceeding
</p>
<p>1.5 . 1.7 Т. The product of two fluxes depends on the fourth power of linear dimension
</p>
<p>l. Hence, the product of stator and rotor flux vectors depends on l4. Hence, the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque available from electrical machine is proportional to l4.
</p>
<p>Power of electromechanical conversion in an electrical machine depends on the
</p>
<p>torque and speed of rotation O; therefore, P ~ V4/3O. Considering two machines
</p>
<p>with the same dimensions and different speeds, the one with the higher speed
</p>
<p>delivers more power. In cases requiring a constant power of electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversion P, while the speed of rotation of the electrical machine can be arbitrarily
</p>
<p>chosen, it is beneficial to select the machine with higher speed, resulting in a lower
</p>
<p>torque T &frac14; P/O and consequently smaller dimensions of the machine due to T ~ l4.
An example where the required load speed can be achieved with different machine
</p>

<p>9.8 Torque&ndash;Size Relation 211</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>speeds is the case where the load and the machine are coupled by gears. While
</p>
<p>designing the system, the gear ratio can be selected so as to result in a higher speed
</p>
<p>of the machine. This will reduce the size and weight of the machine.
</p>
<p>The torque expression (9.16) suggests that the torque is inversely proportional to
</p>
<p>the air gap width d. With constant stator and rotor currents, a decrease in the air gap
</p>
<p>results in an increase in electromagnetic torque. The expression suggests that the
</p>
<p>torque can be increased with no apparent limits, provided that the air gap d can get
</p>
<p>sufficiently small. This conclusion is incorrect as it overlooks the phenomenon of
</p>
<p>magnetic saturation. The expression for the torque has been derived as a result of an
</p>
<p>analysis wheremagnetic saturation in iron is neglected. The stator and rotor magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits are made of iron sheets of very high permeability mFe, making the magnetic
</p>
<p>field in iron HFe negligible. The torque expression (9.16) is based on such an
</p>
<p>assumption. It holds in all the conditions with no magnetic saturation in iron parts
</p>
<p>of themagnetic circuit.With excessive values ofBFe resulting inmagnetic saturation,
</p>
<p>the value of HFe cannot be neglected, and this invalidates the (9.16). The preceding
</p>
<p>analysis finds themagnetic inductionB0 in the air gap inversely proportional to the air
</p>
<p>gap d. Disregarding the slots, the magnetic induction in iron is roughly the same,
</p>
<p>BFe 	 B0. Therefore, progressive decrease of the air gap leads to increased magnetic
induction. As the magnetic induction B reaches Bmax &frac14; 1.5 .. 1.7 T, the iron gets
saturated, permeability mFe drops, and the magnetic field HFe assumes considerable
</p>
<p>value that cannot be neglected. At this point, (9.15) and the consequential results,
</p>
<p>obtained by neglecting saturation, are not valid and cannot be used.
</p>
<p>The air gap of electrical machines is designed to be as small as possible, in order
</p>
<p>to obtained the desired magnetic induction B0 with smaller electrical currents and,
</p>
<p>consequently, smaller copper losses. However, there are limitations of mechanical
</p>
<p>nature which prevent the air gap of smaller machines from getting much below one
</p>
<p>millimeter. The air gap of large electrical machines is at least several millimeters.
</p>
<p>A lower limit of the air gap is required to prevent the revolving rotor from touching
</p>
<p>the stator. Undesired touching and scratching can happen due to finite tolerances
</p>
<p>in manufacturing the stator and rotor surfaces. Elastic deformation of the shaft in
</p>
<p>radial direction can result in rotor touching the stator. These phenomena prevent the
</p>
<p>use of electrical machines with very small air gaps.
</p>
<p>Question (9.5): The expressions for the electromagnetic torque and power of
electrical machine give values inversely proportional to the air gap d. Based on
</p>
<p>these expressions, the power and torque can be increased with no apparent limits,
</p>
<p>keeping the electrical currents constant and reducing the air gap. There are reasons
</p>
<p>that invalidate such conclusion. Provide two reasons which indicate that such
</p>
<p>expectations are not realistic.
</p>
<p>Answer (9.5): The expression for the electromagnetic torque suggests that reduc-
tion of the air gap d results in higher torque and higher power of electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversion. Apparently, very high torque can be achieved with an adequate reduc-
</p>
<p>tion of the air gap.
</p>
<p>This conclusion overlooks the phenomenon of magnetic saturation. The torque
</p>
<p>expression comes from an analysis that starts with an assumption that the magnetic
</p>
<p>212 9 Energy, Flux, and Torque</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>field HFe in iron is negligible. This assumption holds only in cases where the flux
</p>
<p>density BFe does not reach the saturation limit of Bmax &frac14; 1.5 .. 1.7 T. Namely, given
a magnetomotive force Ni &frac14; 2Hd, the flux density B &frac14; m0Ni/(2d) grows as the air
gap decreases. As the flux density B reaches the saturation limit Bmax, any further
</p>
<p>increase of BFe is determined by expression DB &frac14; m0DH. In other words, differen-
tial permeability DB/DH of the saturated ferromagnetic material is close to m0.
</p>
<p>Considering the flux changes, magnetic saturation is equivalent to removing the
</p>
<p>iron parts of the stator and rotor magnetic circuits. Due to DB/DH 	 m0, saturated
iron behaves like air. Therefore, the magnetic saturation can be considered as a very
</p>
<p>large increase in the air gap. Therefore, the initial projections of the air gap
</p>
<p>reduction leading to large torque gains are not realistic. It is of interest to notice
</p>
<p>that most electrical machines are designed so as to get the most out of their
</p>
<p>magnetic circuits. For this to achieve, the flux density levels are close to saturation
</p>
<p>limits. Therefore, there is no margin to accommodate any further increase in B.
</p>
<p>Another reason that prevents the torque increase is the fact that the air gap cannot
</p>
<p>be decreased below certain limits, roughly 1 mm, imposed bymechanical conditions.
</p>
<p>9.9 Rotating Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>According to previous considerations, conditions for generating a nonzero average
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque include a constant relative position Dy of the stator and
</p>
<p>rotor flux vectors. In DC machines, both flux vectors remain still with respect to the
</p>
<p>stator. In alternating current machines, whether asynchronous or synchronous, both
</p>
<p>flux vectors rotate at the same speed.
</p>
<p>In order to meet the above condition and due to rotor revolution, at least one of
</p>
<p>the two fluxes (FS orFR) has to rotate with respect to the winding that originates the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force resulting in the relevant flux. The magnetic field which
</p>
<p>rotates with respect to the originating windings is also called rotating magnetic
</p>
<p>field. In this section, it is shown that rotating magnetic field requires a system
</p>
<p>with at least two separate windings with appropriate spatial displacement of their
</p>
<p>magnetic axes. Alternating currents in the windings should have the same fre-
</p>
<p>quency and amplitude. Their initial phases are to be different and should correspond
</p>
<p>to the spatial displacement of the magnetic axes. In this case, the system of
</p>
<p>windings creates magnetomotive force and flux that revolve at the speed deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the frequency of AC currents.
</p>
<p>9.9.1 System of Two Orthogonal Windings
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic torque is determined by the vector product of the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>flux vectors, and it depends on sine of the angle Dy between the two vectors.

</p>
<p>and/or rotor windings create rotating magnetic field.
</p>
<p>Figure 9.9 shows a stator with two windings, a and b. Each winding has N turns.
</p>
<p>The winding conductors could be either concentrated or distributed. Their construc-
</p>
<p>tion does not affect the subsequent analysis and conclusions. For brevity, it will be
</p>
<p>considered that windings a and b are concentrated. Flux in one turn of a concentrated
</p>
<p>winding is denoted by F. It is equal to the ratio of the magnetomotive force F &frac14; Ni
and the magnetic resistance Rm. Due to high permeability of iron, magnetic fieldHFe
can be neglected. Considering concentrated winding with electrical current i, the
</p>
<p>field strength in the air gap is obtained from relation Ni &frac14; 2dH0, while magnetic
induction B in the air gap is equal to B0 &frac14; m0H0. Surface S1 is encircled by one turn
of the considered concentrated winding. Assuming that the surface passes through
</p>
<p>the air gap, it represents one half of a cylinder and it has the surface area S1 &frac14; pLR.

magnetomotive force Fa &frac14; Nia is produced along the course and direction of the
unit vector a0. The flux in one turn is obtained by dividing the magnetomotive

<p>9.9.2 System of Three Windings
</p>
<p>In most cases, asynchronous and synchronous motors are fed from voltage sources
</p>
<p>providing a symmetrical three-phase system of voltages and currents. When
</p>
<p>operating as generators, the machines convert the mechanical work into electrical
</p>
<p>energy and produce a system of three-phase voltages available to electrical loads at
</p>
<p>the stator terminals. For this reason, the stator windings of asynchronous and
</p>
<p>synchronous machines usually have three phases. That is, there are three separate,
</p>
<p>spatially displaced windings on the stator. The three separate stator windings are
</p>
<p>called the phases and assigned letters a, b, and c. In three-phasemachines, the axes of
</p>
<p>the phase windings are spatially displaced by 2p/3. Figure 9.10 shows a machine
</p>
<p>with phase windings a, b, and c carrying sinusoidal currents of equal amplitudes Im,
</p>
<p>equal angular frequency os, and with difference in initial phases of 
2p/3. The
phase shift of the phase currents corresponds to the spatial displacement between
</p>
<p>the magnetic axes of the phase windings.
</p>
<p>The magnetomotive forces Fa, Fb, and Fc of the windings have amplitudes Nia,
</p>
<p>Nib, and Nic. Their orientation is determined by magnetic axes of respective
</p>
<p>windings, and their courses can be expressed in terms of unit vectors a0 and b0,

<p>Chapter 10
</p>
<p>Electromotive Forces
</p>
<p>Electromotive forces induced in windings of electrical machines are analyzed and
</p>
<p>discussed in this chapter. Analysis includes transformer electromotive forces
</p>
<p>and dynamic electromotive forces. The rms values, the waveforms, and harmonics
</p>
<p>are derived for concentrated and distributed windings. For real windings that have
</p>
<p>conductors distributed in a limited number of slots, the electromotive forces are
</p>
<p>calculated by introducing, explaining, and using chord factors and belt factors.
</p>
<p>Discussion includes design methods that suppress low-order harmonics in
</p>
<p>electromotive forces. This chapter concludes with the analysis of distributed
</p>
<p>windings with sinusoidal change of conductor density. Calculation of flux linkage
</p>
<p>and electromotive force in such windings shows that they achieve suppression of all
</p>
<p>harmonic distortions and operate as ideal spatial filters.
</p>
<p>Variation of the flux in the machine windings results in induction of
</p>
<p>electromotive forces, proportional to the first time derivative of the flux. The voltage
</p>
<p>balance in each winding is given by equation u &frac14; Ri + dC/dt, where u denotes the
voltage across the winding terminals, i is the electrical current in the winding, R is
</p>
<p>the winding resistance, while the flux derivative represents the induced
</p>
<p>electromotive force. In the introductory courses of electrical engineering,
</p>
<p>the electromotive force is calculated as the first derivative of the flux with a leading
</p>
<p>negative sign, e &frac14; �dC/dt. This convention indicates that the induced electro-
motive force and consequential change in electrical current oppose to the flux
</p>
<p>changes. Namely, in a short circuited winding (u &frac14; 0), the flux changes produce
the electromotive force which, in turn, gives a rise to electrical current which
</p>
<p>opposes to the flux changes. Adopting another convention has its own advantages
</p>
<p>as well. By defining the electromotive force e &frac14; +dC/dt, the current in the winding
is determined as the ratio of the voltage difference (u � e) and the resistance R. The
electromotive force defined as e &frac14; +dC/dt is opposed to the voltage. Therefore, it is
also called counter electromotive force. In this book, the latter convention has been
</p>
<p>adopted with e denoting +dC/dt and with the voltage balance in each windings being
</p>
<p>u &frac14; Ri + e.

<p>10.1 Transformer and Dynamic Electromotive Forces
</p>
<p>Electromotive forces are generated due to changes of the winding flux. The flux can
</p>
<p>change due to changes in electrical currents of the windings or due to motion of the
</p>
<p>rotor with respect to the stator. In cases where the flux changes take place due to
</p>
<p>motion, the consequential electromotive forces are called dynamic electromotive
</p>
<p>forces. In cases where the stator windings carry constant currents, dynamic
</p>
<p>electromotive force appears in the rotor winding which rotates with respect to
</p>
<p>stator. Constant stator currents create a stationary magnetic field which does not
</p>
<p>move with respect to the stator. One part of this flux encircles the rotor windings as
</p>
<p>well. The rotor flux caused by the stator current depends on the relative position
</p>
<p>between the stator and rotor. When the rotor moves, such rotor flux changes, and
</p>
<p>this leads to creation of a dynamic electromotive force.
</p>
<p>Electromotive force can also arise in cases with no rotor movement. If electrical
</p>
<p>current in stator conductors is variable, the flux created by the stator winding is
</p>
<p>variable as well. In part, the rotor flux is a consequence of stator currents. The
</p>
<p>amount of the rotor flux caused by stator currents is determined by the mutual
</p>
<p>inductance between the stator and rotor windings. Even with the rotor that does not
</p>
<p>move, the rotor flux varies due to variable electrical currents in the stator winding.
</p>
<p>As a consequence, an electromotive force is induced in the rotor winding. It is
</p>
<p>called transformer electromotive force. In a power transformer, alternating currents
</p>
<p>in the primary winding produce a variable flux which also encircles the secondary
</p>
<p>winding. Variable flux leads to the transformer electromotive force in the second-
</p>
<p>ary winding, providing the means for passing the electrical power from the primary
</p>
<p>to the secondary side.
</p>
<p>Electromotive force e &frac14; Ldi/dt, which appears in a stand-alone winding due to
variation of the electrical current i, is proportional to the coefficient L, the self-
</p>
<p>inductance of the winding. This electromotive force is called the electromotive
</p>
<p>force of self-induction.
</p>
<p>10.2 Electromotive Force in One Turn
</p>
<p>For the purpose of modeling electrical machines, it is necessary to calculate the
</p>
<p>electromotive force induced in concentrated and distributed windings. Figure 10.1
</p>
<p>shows an electrical machine with permanent magnets in the rotor magnetic circuit.
</p>
<p>The magnets are shaped and arranged in the way to create sinusoidal distribution of
</p>
<p>the magnetic induction in the air gap,
</p>
<p>B &frac14; Bm cos&eth;y� ym&THORN;: (10.1)
</p>
<p>Due to rotation of the rotor, the maximum induction Bm &frac14; m0Hm is reached at
position y &frac14; ym, where ym represents relative position of the rotor with respect to
</p>
<p>224 10 Electromotive Forces</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the stator. In the case when rotor revolves at a constant speed Om, position of the
</p>
<p>rotor changes as ym &frac14; Omt, and magnetic induction at the observed position y is
equal to
</p>
<p>B y; t&eth; &THORN; &frac14; Bm cos&eth;y� Omt&THORN;:
</p>
<p>The expression represents a wave of sinusoidally distributed magnetic field
</p>
<p>which moves along with the rotor. It is of interest to determine the electromotive
</p>
<p>force induced in one turn of the stator. This turn is shown in Fig. 10.1, and it is made
</p>
<p>of two diametrical conductors. Conductor denoted by
N
</p>
<p>is at position yN &frac14; 0,
while conductor denoted by
</p>
<p>J
</p>
<p>is at position yJ &frac14; p. The electromotive force in
the stator turn can be determined in two ways:
</p>
<p>1. By determining the first derivative of the flux encircling the turn
</p>
<p>2. By calculating and summing the electromotive forces of individual conductors
</p>
<p>10.2.1 Calculating the First Derivative of the Flux in One Turn
</p>
<p>First derivative of the flux in one turn determines the counter electromotive force
</p>
<p>which is induced in the turn. The flux encircling the turn exists due to action of the
</p>
<p>permanent magnets mounted on the rotor, which create magnetic field in the air gap.
</p>
<p>Spatial distribution of the magnetic induction in the air gap, along the rotor
</p>
<p>circumference, is described by expression (10.1). The flux in the considered turn
</p>
<p>is equal to the surface integral of the magnetic induction over any surface leaning
</p>
<p>on conductors
N
</p>
<p>and
J
</p>
<p>. In order to facilitate the calculation, one should select the
</p>
<p>surface which passes through the air gap; the expression B(y) is readily available.
</p>
<p>Such a surface is a semicylinder starting from conductor
N
</p>
<p>at position y &frac14; 0,
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.1 Rotor field is created by action of permanent magnets built in the magnetic circuit of the

<p>passing through the air gap in the upper part of the figure and ending up by leaning
</p>
<p>on conductor
J
</p>
<p>at position y &frac14; p. The selected semicylinder has length L and
diameter R&cedil; where L is length and R is diameter of the rotor. Area of the selected
</p>
<p>surface is
</p>
<p>S &frac14; L � R � p: (10.2)
</p>
<p>The flux in the turn is calculated as the surface integral of the magnetic
</p>
<p>induction, given by expression (10.1), over the selected surface, the semi cylinder.
</p>
<p>Since the magnetic field in the air gap is radial, the vectors of the field H and the
</p>
<p>magnetic induction B are perpendicular to the surface. The scalar product of vector
</p>
<p>B and the surface element dS, the latter aided with the unit normal on the
</p>
<p>semicylinder, becomes the product between the amplitudes of B and dS. Thus,
the expression for the flux obtains the form

<p>10.2.2 Summing Electromotive Forces of Individual Conductors
</p>
<p>It is possible to determine the electromotive force in one turn by summing the
</p>
<p>electromotive forces of individual conductors that make one turn. In the example
</p>
<p>presented in Fig. 10.1, the field of permanent magnets revolves with respect to
</p>
<p>the stator conductors. The peripheral speed of relative motion is v &frac14; ROm, where R
is the rotor radius and Om is the angular speed of the rotor. In the conductor denoted
</p>
<p>by
N
</p>
<p>, the electromotive force is
</p>
<p>e� &frac14; L � R � Om � Bm � cos Omt&eth; &THORN;:
</p>
<p>At position y &frac14; p, where the diametrical conductor
J
</p>
<p>is placed, the magnetic
</p>
<p>induction has the same amplitude and the opposite direction. For this reason, the
</p>
<p>electromotive force eJ induced in the conductor denoted by
J
</p>
<p>is of the opposite
</p>
<p>direction, eN &frac14; �eJ. The electromotive force in one turn is obtained by summing
the electromotive forces in individual conductors. One turn is formed by connecting
</p>
<p>the two conductors in series. The terminals of the turn are made available at the
</p>
<p>front side of the cylinder. The other ends of the conductors
N
</p>
<p>and
J
</p>
<p>are connected
</p>
<p>at the rear side of the cylinder. Therefore, when circulating along the contour made
</p>
<p>by the two conductors, the electromotive forces of conductors eN and eJ are
</p>
<p>summed according to e &frac14; eN � eJ. Finally, the electromotive force in one turn is
</p>
<p>e1 &frac14; 2 � e� &frac14; 2 � L � R � Om � Bm � cos Omt&eth; &THORN;: (10.6)
</p>
<p>According to expression (10.4), the maximum value of the flux in one turn is
</p>
<p>equal to Fm &frac14; 2LRBm, and the previous expression can be written as
</p>
<p>e1 &frac14; OmFm cos Omt&eth; &THORN;; (10.7)
</p>
<p>which is in accordance with (10.5).
</p>
<p>In the considered example, the induced electromotive forces are harmonic
</p>
<p>functions of time; thus, it is possible to represent them by phasors. Summing the
</p>
<p>electromotive forces eN and eJ can be represented by phasors, as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.3.
</p>
<p>10.2.3 Voltage Balance in One Turn
</p>
<p>The voltage balance within one turn is given by equation

<p>where e1 represents (counter) electromotive force. If the resistance R of the turn is
</p>
<p>sufficiently low, the voltage drop Ri can be neglected, and the electromotive force
</p>
<p>e1 is equal to the voltage across the terminals of the turn. Since the electromotive
</p>
<p>force is a sinusoidal function of time, its rms (root mean square) value is given by
</p>
<p>(10.9), where f is the frequency in Hz, that is, the number of rotor revolutions per

<p>10.2.5 Root Mean Square (rms) Value of Electromotive Forces
</p>
<p>The AC voltages and currents in electrical engineering are characterized by their
</p>
<p>rms value (root mean square). Sinusoidal voltages and currents are mostly
</p>
<p>described in terms of their rms value instead of their peak values. Root mean square
</p>
<p>(rms) value of an AC voltage corresponds to DC voltage that would result in the
</p>
<p>same power when applied to resistive loads. Namely, when an AC voltage with
</p>
<p>the rms value of U is applied to the resistance R, the power dissipated in resistive
</p>
<p>load will be P &frac14; U2/R. The same power is obtained when a DC voltageU is applied
across the same resistance. Therefore, the rms value of AC voltages is also called
</p>
<p>equivalent DC voltage. For sinusoidal voltages, their rms value is obtained by
</p>
<p>dividing their peak value by the square root of two. The rms value can be defined
</p>
<p>as well for periodic non-sinusoidal voltages. For a voltage that changes periodically
</p>
<p>with a period T, the rms value is calculated according to

<p>10.3 Electromotive Force in a Winding
</p>
<p>Electrical machines usually have a number of windings. Most induction and
</p>
<p>synchronous machines, also called AC machines, have their stator designed for
</p>
<p>the connection to a three-phase system of alternating voltages and currents. There-
</p>
<p>fore, most AC machines have three windings on the stator, also called phase
</p>
<p>windings. Some authors use the term stator winding to describe the winding system
</p>
<p>comprising three-phase windings.
</p>
<p>Each winding has one or more turns. Individual turns are connected in series.
</p>
<p>The ends of this series connection are usually made available at machine terminals.
</p>
<p>In this section, the electromotive force induced in a winding is calculated for
</p>
<p>concentrated and distributed windings. This electromotive force determines the
</p>
<p>voltage across the machine terminals.
</p>
<p>10.3.1 Concentrated Winding
</p>
<p>Conductors making a winding can be concentrated in two diametrically positioned
</p>
<p>grooves, constituting a concentrated winding. Since all the turns of a concentrated
</p>
<p>winding reside in the same position, they all have the same flux and the same
</p>
<p>electromotive force. The rms value of the electromotive force in one turn, made of
</p>
<p>two diametrically positioned conductors, is given by expression (10.12). For a
</p>
<p>concentrated winding with N turns, the rms value of the induced electromotive
</p>
<p>force is given by expression (10.14).
</p>
<p>10.3.2 Distributed Winding
</p>
<p>Windings are usually made by placing conductors in a number of equally spaced
</p>
<p>slots along the machine circumference. Individual turns are spatially shifted and
</p>
<p>have different electromotive forces. For this reason, the electromotive force
</p>
<p>230 10 Electromotive Forces</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>induced in a distributed winding is not equal to the product of the number of turns N
</p>
<p>and the electromotive force induced in one turn. The process of calculating the
</p>
<p>electromotive force of a distributed winding is explained in this section.
</p>
<p>The turns making a winding are often made of conductor pairs that do not have
</p>
<p>diametrical displacement. Namely, the two conductors making one turn may not
</p>
<p>have angular displacement of p. Displacement of the two conductors is also called
</p>
<p>pitch of the turn. With pitch lower than p, one obtains fractional-pitch turn or
</p>
<p>fractional-pitch coil.
</p>
<p>In distributed windings, conductors of a winding may be placed in several
</p>
<p>adjacent slots. A group of conductor is called a winding belt. In Fig. 10.2, a sample
</p>
<p>winding is depicted with three series-connected turns, 1A&ndash;1B, 2A&ndash;2B, and 3A&ndash;3B.
</p>
<p>Conductors 1A and 1B belong to one turn, and they are placed in the slots at an
</p>
<p>angular distance of a. With a &frac14; p, the conductors are diametrically positioned,
making a full-pitch coil. In the case when a &lt; p, conductors 1A and 1B reside on a
chord. In this case, turn 1A&ndash;1B is fractional-pitch turn.
</p>
<p>The electromotive force induced in a fractional-pitch turn is smaller than in the
</p>
<p>case of a full-pitch turn. The reduction is determined by a coefficient called chord
</p>
<p>factor.
</p>
<p>Conductors 1A, 2A, and 3A are placed in three adjacent slots which make a
</p>
<p>winding belt. In the same way, conductors 1B, 2B, and 3B are placed in other three
</p>
<p>adjacent slots. The electromotive forces induced in the turns 1A&ndash;1B, 2A&ndash;2B, and
</p>
<p>3A&ndash;3B are not equal due to spatial displacement of corresponding turns. Therefore,
</p>
<p>electromotive forces in individual turns do not reach their maximum value at the
</p>
<p>same instant. The spatial shift between magnetic axes of individual turns results in a
</p>
<p>phase shift between corresponding electromotive forces. For this reason, the peak and
</p>

conductors of a winding
</p>
<p>having fractional-pitch turns
</p>
<p>and belt distribution in m &frac14; 3
slots
</p>
<p>10.3 Electromotive Force in a Winding 231</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>rms value of the winding electromotive force is smaller than the product obtained by
</p>
<p>multiplying the number of turns (3) and the peak/rms value of the electromotive force
</p>
<p>in one turn. This reduction is determined by the coefficient called the belt distribution
</p>
<p>factor or belt factor. Calculation of the electromotive force of a distributed winding
</p>
<p>requires both the chord factor and the belt factor to be known.
</p>
<p>10.3.3 Chord Factor
</p>
<p>The expressions for electromotive force obtained so far are applicable to turns made
</p>
<p>of diametrically positioned conductors, namely, to full-pitch turns. There is a need
</p>
<p>explained later on requiring the two conductors making one turn to be placed at an
</p>
<p>angular distance smaller than p. The reason for applying fractional pitch may be the
</p>
<p>desire to shorten the end turns, the wires at machine ends that connect the two
</p>
<p>conductors in series hence completing the turn. In most cases, the fractional-pitch
</p>
<p>turns are used to reduce or eliminate the undesired higher harmonics that may
</p>
<p>appear in the electromotive force.
</p>
<p>As an example, one can start from the machine shown in Fig. 10.2 and assume
</p>
<p>that the spatial distribution of the magnetic inductance B(y) in the air gap is not
</p>
<p>sinusoidal. For the purpose of discussion, the function B(y) is assumed to be
</p>
<p>Bm1cos(y � ym) + Bm5 cos5(y � ym). Based upon that, the electromotive forces
eN and eJ induced in the conductors constituting one turn comprise the component
</p>
<p>at the basic angular frequency o &frac14; Om, but also the fifth harmonic at frequency of
5Om. In cases where conductors
</p>
<p>N
</p>
<p>and
J
</p>
<p>are positioned at angular distance p, the
</p>
<p>electromotive forces induced in them are of the same shape. The fundamental
</p>
<p>harmonic component of the electromotive force depends on Bm1. At the same
</p>
<p>time, higher harmonics of the magnetic induction determine the higher harmonics
</p>
<p>of the electromotive force. By connecting diametrically positioned conductors in
</p>
<p>series, the electromotive force at the fundamental frequency is doubled, but so is the
</p>
<p>unwanted electromotive force of the fifth harmonic.
</p>
<p>If the conductors are placed so that the angular distance between them is a &frac14; 4p/5,
there is a phase shift between the electromotive forces eN and eJwhich depends on
</p>
<p>the angular distance a. In the course of the rotor motion, the instant of passing of the
</p>
<p>north magnetic pole of the rotor against the stator conductor
J
</p>
<p>is delayed by
</p>
<p>Dt &frac14; a/Om with respect to the instant of passing of the same pole against the
conductor
</p>
<p>N
</p>
<p>. The electromotive force of conductor
J
</p>
<p>has angular frequency Om,
</p>
<p>and it is phase shifted by a with respect to the electromotive force of conductor
N
</p>
<p>.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 10.1, the angular distance between the two conductors making the turn is
</p>
<p>a &frac14; p. In Fig. 10.2, there are turns with a &lt; p. With a &frac14; p, electromotive forces in
conductors
</p>
<p>N
</p>
<p>and
J
</p>
<p>have the opposite sign. They are connected in series by the end
</p>
<p>turn which provides the current path between the ends of conductors at the same
</p>
<p>machine and. With such connection, the electromotive forces with opposite sign
</p>
<p>actually add up. For that reason, the electromotive force induced in a single turn in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.1 is two times larger than electromotive forces of individual conductors.
</p>
<p>232 10 Electromotive Forces</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Electromotive forces in individual conductors can be represented by phasors
</p>
<p>eN and eJ. With peripheral rotor speed of v &frac14; ROm, and with B(y) &frac14; Bm
cos(y � ym), both phasors have the same amplitude |eN| &frac14; |eJ| &frac14; e1 &frac14; LvBm,
where L denotes the axial length of the machine. The phasor of the electromotive
</p>
<p>force in the turn, shown in Fig. 10.3a, is obtained by summing the phasors eN and
</p>
<p>eJ, e &frac14; eN � eJ. With angular distance between conductors of a, eN &frac14; e1, eJ
&frac14; e1e�ja and (-eJ) &frac14; e1e�ja+jp. By placing the conductors at angular distance 4p/5,
phasors of electromotive forces eN and eJ are not be collinear, and this is illustrated
</p>
<p>in part (b) of Fig. 10.3.With respect to eN, electromotive force�eJ is phase shifted
by p/5. Therefore, the amplitude of the resulting electromotive force in one turn
</p>
<p>eN � eJ is slightly smaller than the sum of amplitudes LvBm of electromotive
forces in individual conductors.
</p>
<p>Phasor diagrams can be constructed for the fundamental harmonic but also for
</p>
<p>each of the higher harmonics. With B(y) &frac14; Bm1cos(y � ym) + Bm5 cos5(y � ym),
electromotive forces have the fundamental component of frequency Om and ampli-
</p>
<p>tude determined by Bm1 and the fifth harmonic of frequency 5Om and amplitude
</p>
<p>determined by Bm5. For the fifth harmonic of electromotive forces, the phase
</p>
<p>difference is multiplied by 5, as well as the frequency. Since 5 � p/5 &frac14; p, the
fifth harmonic of the electromotive force eN is in opposition with the fifth harmonic
</p>
<p>of the electromotive force (�eJ). Thus, they will be mutually canceled. Despite the
presence of the fifth harmonic in the spatial distribution of B(y), the electromotive
</p>
<p>force induced in the considered turn will not contain the fifth harmonic. One of the
</p>
<p>consequences of shortening the turn pitch is reduction of the first, fundamental
</p>
<p>harmonic of the electromotive force. The electromotive force in one turn formed by
</p>
<p>the fractional-pitch conductors can be determined from the phasor diagrams of

</p>
<p>Question (10.2): How do we place the conductors making one turn in order to
eliminate the seventh harmonic of the induced electromotive force? It is assumed
</p>
<p>that the spatial distribution B(y) comprises the seventh harmonic.
</p>
<p>Answer (10.2): By placing conductors at the angular distance of 6p/7 and by
making their series connections in the way that leads to adding of electromotive
</p>
<p>forces at the fundamental frequency, phasors of electromotive forces at the funda-
</p>
<p>mental frequency are shifted by p/7, while phasors of the seventh harmonic are
</p>
<p>shifted by p. Therefore, by summing the electromotive forces of the two
</p>
<p>conductors, the seventh harmonic is eliminated.

</p>
<p>Electromotive force induced in the turn made of conductors P1 and P2, shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.4, placed at angular distance a &lt; p is smaller than the electromotive force
induced in the turn P1&ndash;P3 which is obtained by connecting diametrically positioned
</p>
<p>conductors. Reduction of the electromotive force due to this fractional-pitch setting
</p>
<p>of conductors is determined by the coefficient kT called chord factor. The coeffi-
</p>
<p>cient kT can be determined by investigating the electromotive force induced in the

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the rms value of the electromotive force E1 induced in one of the conductors.
</p>
<p>Opposite to angle a/2 is the side BC of the length E1�sin(a/2). The rms value of
the electromotive force induced in the turn is represented by phasor DC. It has twice
</p>
<p>the length of the side BC, and it amounts 2E1 sin(a/2) &frac14; 2E1 kT. Therefore, due to
fractional pitch, the electromotive force in one turn is smaller than 2E1. Chord factor
</p>
<p>kT &frac14; sin(a/2) is in accordance with the result (10.18).
Within the subsequent sections, winding design methods are discussed that
</p>
<p>result in reduction of harmonic distortions of the electromotive force and even
</p>
<p>elimination of certain harmonics of lower order. These methods include placing
</p>
<p>conductors of one turn along chord instead diameter and arranging winding turns in
</p>
<p>belts. To facilitate calculation of electromotive forces induced in such windings,
</p>
<p>analysis results in coefficients called belt factor and chord factor.
</p>
<p>In Sect. 10.5, the electromotive force induced in ideal distributed winding is
</p>
<p>analyzed, proving that the induced electromotive force of this winding comprises
</p>
<p>only the fundamental harmonic, notwithstanding the non-sinusoidal distribution of
</p>
<p>the magnetic induction B(y) and non-sinusoidal waveforms of electromotive forces
</p>
<p>induced in individual conductors. Basically, an appropriate series connection of all
</p>
<p>the winding conductors can be envisaged so as to cancel all the harmonics in
</p>
<p>induced electromotive force except for the fundamental. The subsequent analysis
</p>
<p>will consider the winding with sinusoidal distribution of conductors along the
</p>
<p>machine circumference. With an ideal sinusoidal distribution of conductors, all
</p>
<p>the distortions in are canceled, resulting in a sinusoidal electromotive force of the
</p>
<p>winding. The winding then acts as a spatial filter, removing distortions in the spatial
</p>
<p>distribution B(y) and giving a sinusoidal electromotive force.

<p>10.3.4 Belt Factor
</p>
<p>Windings of practical machines are made by placing conductors in slots, axially cut
</p>
<p>grooves in the magnetic circuit. The stator and rotor have large numbers of slots.
</p>
<p>Figure 8.1 shows a cross section of the magnetic circuit of an electrical machine
</p>
<p>exposing the usual shapes of the slots and their number.
</p>
<p>One turn consists of the two diametrical conductors or the two conductors placed
</p>
<p>at the ends of the chord. On the other hand, a three-phase stator winding comprises
</p>
<p>three phases, three separate windings having their magnetic axes displaced by 2p/3.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the minimum number of slots contained by the stator magnetic circuit of
</p>
<p>a three-phase machine is 2 � 3 &frac14; 6. This number of slots is used in cases where
each of the phase windings is concentrated, that is, where all conductors in a
</p>
<p>winding are placed in two diametrical slots. The number of slots is usually higher
</p>
<p>than 6. One of the reasons for using higher number of slots is the problem associated
</p>
<p>with placing one half of all the conductors of one winding into only one slot. Such
</p>
<p>slot would have an extremely large cross section that is not practical for the
</p>
<p>machine construction. Thus, the conductors are usually distributed in a number of
</p>
<p>neighboring slots. In this way, a winding belt is formed. A belt comprises two, three,
</p>
<p>or more adjacent slots. Each slot of the belt can accommodate one or more winding
</p>
<p>conductors. In order to simplify further considerations, one may assume that
</p>
<p>each slot of the belt contains only one conductor. In cases where each slot has M
</p>
<p>conductors, all the subsequent conclusions hold, except for the electromotive forces
</p>
<p>amplitude which has to be multiplied by M.
</p>
<p>An example of a winding belt having conductors placed in three adjacent slots is
</p>
<p>presented in Fig. 10.6 The figure shows the cross section of such winding and
</p>
<p>phasor diagram showing relation between the electromotive forces induced in the
</p>
<p>individual windings. The turns 1A&ndash;1B, 2A&ndash;2B, and 3A&ndash;3B have full pitch, namely,
</p>
<p>these turns are made of diametrically positioned conductors. Phasors E1, E2, and E3
represent the electromotive forces of turns 1A&ndash;1B, 2A&ndash;2B, and 3A&ndash;3B, respec-
</p>
<p>tively. Angle g in Fig. 10.6 denotes the distance between the two adjacent slots. The
</p>
<p>spatial shift between the turns results in the phase shift g between electromotive
</p>
<p>forces induced in corresponding turns.
</p>
<p>Placing of conductors in winding belts allows elimination or reduction of higher
</p>
<p>harmonics in the induced electromotive force. Due to the spatial displacement
</p>
<p>between conductors, the electromotive forces in individual conductors are phase
</p>
<p>shifted, as explained in the preceding section discussing the chord factor. In cases
</p>
<p>where a winding belt ranges over m neighboring slots, the electromotive force of
</p>
<p>the winding can be determined according to equation

<p>turns, said turns comprising conductors placed in the adjacent slots. By using
</p>
<p>(10.19) and phasor diagram given in Fig. 10.7, it can be shown that distribution
</p>
<p>of conductors within the winding belts leads to elimination of certain higher
</p>
<p>harmonics in the induced electromotive force.
</p>
<p>10.3.5 Harmonics Suppression of Winding Belt
</p>
<p>According to (10.10), variation of the conductor electromotive force is determined
</p>
<p>by spatial distribution of the magnetic induction in the air gap. If the spatial
</p>
<p>distribution of magnetic induction contains a higher spatial harmonic of the order
</p>
<p>n, the time change of the electromotive force induced in a single conductor contains
</p>
<p>a higher harmonic of the order n. In a full-pitch turn, conductors are placed in
</p>
<p>diametri cally positioned slots, and the electromotive force is twice the electro-
</p>
<p>motive force of a single conductor. Therefore, the harmonic of the order n is present
</p>
<p>as well by the electromotive force of the turn.
</p>
<p>The electromotive force of the winding shown in Fig. 10.6 is equal to the sum of
</p>
<p>electromotive forces in spatially shifted turns 1A&ndash;1B, 2A&ndash;2B, and 3A&ndash;3B. It is
</p>
<p>possible to cancel higher harmonics by the proper selection of the angle g. Diagram

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>in Fig. 10.6b shows phasors E1, E2, and E3 which represent the fundamental
</p>
<p>harmonic of the electromotive forces in turns 1A&ndash;1B, 2A&ndash;2B, and 3A&ndash;3B. The
</p>
<p>phasors are shifted by angle g which represents the spatial shift of the two adjacent
</p>
<p>turns. Higher harmonics of the electromotive forces can also be represented by
</p>
<p>phasors. Harmonics of the order n are of the same amplitude in all considered
</p>
<p>turns, but their initial phases differ due to their space shift. The angular frequency
</p>
<p>is increased n times for the n-th harmonic. In adjacent conductors, the spatial shift g
</p>
<p>produces the phase delay for the n-th harmonic of ng. In the phase diagram
</p>
<p>representing n-th harmonics of the electromotive forces of the turns, phasors Е1n,
</p>
<p>Е2n, и Е3n are shifted by angle ng.
</p>
<p>If angle g in Fig. 10.6a is equal to 2p/(3�n), phasors on the n-th harmonic Е1n,
Е2n, и Е3n are shifted by 2p/3. Since amplitudes of these phasors are all equal, their
</p>
<p>phase diagram is represented by an equilateral triangle where the beginning of
</p>
<p>the first and end of the last phasor coincide. That is, the sum of the phasors of the
</p>
<p>n-th harmonic in all the three turns is equal to zero. Therefore, in cases where
</p>
<p>g &frac14; 2p/(3�n), harmonics of the electromotive force of the order n are eliminated.
In general, two winding belts making a winding may cover m consecutive slots
</p>
<p>each. The winding then consists of m turns connected in series. If the angle g equals
</p>
<p>2p/(m�n), the phase shift of the fundamental component of the electromotive force in
the adjacent turns is equal to 2p/(m�n), while the phase shift of the n-th harmonic is
2p/m. The electromotive force is induced in the winding with n-th harmonic
</p>
<p>obtained by adding m phasors, each representing the n-th harmonic in a single
</p>
<p>turn. These m phasors are of the same amplitude, with their initial phases shifted

</p>
<p>The last expression can be represented graphically. By addingm phasors mutually
</p>
<p>shifted by 2p/m, the end of the last phasor coincides with the beginning of the first
</p>
<p>one. The phasor diagram is represented by a polygon of m sides of equal length. The
</p>
<p>polygon is inscribed within the circle with phasors of the n-th harmonic in individual
</p>
<p>turns being the chords of the circle.
</p>
<p>Therefrom, one can conclude that the resultant electromotive force of the
</p>
<p>harmonic of the n-th order is equal to zero provided that the angle g equals
</p>
<p>2p/(m�n). In other words, the n-th harmonic can be eliminated provided that the
winding belt spans over m slots is placed at an angular distance of 2p/n.
</p>
<p>With the slots distributed in a belt, the fundamental component of the resultant
</p>
<p>electromotive force is slightly smaller than what would be the electromotive force
</p>
<p>in a concentrated winding. By using the diagram in Fig. 10.7, it can be noticed that
</p>
<p>the amplitude of the sum of phasors E1 &thorn; E2 &thorn; E3 is smaller than the sum of
individual amplitudes |E1| &thorn; |E2| &thorn; |E3|. This difference appears since the phasors
being added are not collinear. Factor kP is equal to the ratio

<p>In cases where the width of the winding belt is m &frac14; 3, the fundamental compo-
nent of the resultant electromotive force is obtained by adding three phasors, as

<p>Phasors E1, E2, and E3 are lying on a circle of radius R. For each of the isosceles

Question (10.3): Due to non-sinusoidal distribution of magnetic induction B(y),
the electromotive forces induced in conductors comprise higher harmonics. A
</p>
<p>winding of 3 turns consists of 6 conductors. The conductors are placed at angular
</p>
<p>distance of g &frac14; 24
. The resultant electromotive force measured at the winding
terminals does not have some of the higher harmonics that are present in
</p>
<p>electromotive forces of single conductor. What is the order of these harmonics?
</p>
<p>Answer (10.3): The resultant electromotive force of the harmonic of the order n is
equal to zero in cases where g &frac14; 2p/(m�n) or g &frac14; q�2p/(m�n), where q is an integer.
Since m &frac14; 3 and g &frac14; 2p/15, all harmonics of the order n &frac14; 5q are eliminated.
These are all the harmonics with the order n being an integer multiple of five.

<p>10.4 Electromotive Force of Compound Winding

<p>Windings are usually made by series connecting the fractional-pitch turns, namely,
</p>
<p>the turns made of conductors that are not diametrically placed, but reside at the ends
</p>
<p>of a chord. In addition, conductors of several turns are distributed in adjacent slots
</p>
<p>that make up one winding belt. For this reason, calculation of the fundamental (first)
</p>
<p>harmonic component in the electromotive force of the winding should include the
</p>
<p>belt and pitch factors. These factors are given by expressions

</p>
<p>where N &frac14; NC/2 is the number of turns, Bm is the maximum value of sinusoidally
distributed magnetic induction in the air gap, while L and R stand for the machine
</p>
<p>length and the rotor radius. Quantity f is the frequency of the induced electromotive
</p>
<p>forces. In the example given in Fig. 10.6, the frequency f is equal to the number of
</p>
<p>rotor revolutions per second.
</p>
<p>The preceding expression can be written in the form
</p>
<p>Erms &frac14; 4; 44kPkTNfFpm;
</p>
<p>where Fm
p &frac14; 2LRBm represents the maximum value of the flux which would have
</p>
<p>existed in a single full-pitched turn. In distributed windings with fractional-pitch
</p>
<p>turns, the quantity Fm
p is hypothetic, and expression (10.24) is more suitable.
</p>
<p>10.5 Harmonics
</p>
<p>The waveform of dynamic electromotive force is determined by distribution of the
</p>
<p>magnetic field in the air gap. In cases where the magnetic field H and induction B
</p>
<p>vary sinusoidally along the machine circumference, the electromotive force is a
</p>
<p>sinusoidal function of time, and it does not contain distortions and higher
</p>
<p>harmonics. The fundamental or basic frequency component is also called first
</p>
<p>harmonic. The term higher harmonics refers to any other harmonic of the order
</p>
<p>n &gt; 1. The presence of higher harmonics distorts the waveform and makes it non-
sinusoidal. The field in the air gap appears as a consequence of the magnetomotive
</p>
<p>forces created by electrical currents in conductors but also due to the presence of
</p>
<p>permanent magnets on the rotor. In both cases, one of the goals which is set up in
</p>
<p>the course of machine design is to achieve near-sinusoidal distribution of the
</p>
<p>magnetic field in the air gap, so as to obtain sinusoidal electromotive forces. This
</p>
<p>goal cannot be accomplished in full for a number of reasons. For one, conductors
</p>
<p>making the windings do not have sinusoidal distribution as they have to be placed in
</p>
<p>slots. Magnetic circuit of electrical machines usually has several tens of slots. Thus,
</p>
<p>there is a relatively small number of slots available for placing conductors. Electri-
</p>
<p>cal current in such conductors produces magnetomotive force and magnetic field in
</p>
<p>the air gap. Deviation from harmonic distribution of conductors leads to appearance
</p>
<p>242 10 Electromotive Forces</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>of higher spatial harmonics of the magnetic induction B(y) in the air gap. The
</p>
<p>presence of higher harmonics makes the spatial distribution of B(y) a non-
</p>
<p>sinusoidal function of the angle y. Similarly, permanent magnets built in the rotor
</p>
<p>cannot produce an ideal, sinusoidal distribution of the magnetic field, but they
</p>
<p>create magnetic field comprising higher spatial harmonics.
</p>
<p>With the magnetic field B(y) in the air gap and with the rotor rotating at the
</p>
<p>speed of Om, electromotive forces are induced in stator conductors, proportional to
</p>
<p>the magnetic inductance and the speed. In the conductor at position y &frac14; 0, the
induced electromotive force is E &frac14; ROmLB(0 � ym), and it can be written as
E &frac14; kB(0 � Omt). In cases when the spatial distribution B(y) contains the fifth
harmonic, magnetic induction at position y &frac14; 0 is
</p>
<p>B5 cos 5 y� ym&eth; &THORN; &frac14; B5 cos 5 0� ym&eth; &THORN; &frac14; B5 cos 5Omt&eth; &THORN;;
</p>
<p>thus, the fifth harmonic of the electromotive force induced in the conductor placed
</p>
<p>at y &frac14; 0 is
</p>
<p>E5 &frac14; ROmLB5 cos 5Omt&eth; &THORN;:
</p>
<p>Therefore, higher spatial harmonics of the function B(y) result in higher
</p>
<p>harmonics of the induced electromotive force.
</p>
<p>Higher harmonics of the electromotive force create electromagnetic disturbances
</p>
<p>and contribute to pulsations in electromagnetic torque. They increase the maximum
</p>
<p>and rms values of the electrical current with respect to the case with sinusoidal
</p>
<p>electromotive forces. As a consequence, power of losses in electrical machine
</p>
<p>increases. For this reason, the windings of electrical machines are designed and
</p>
<p>built with the aim of minimizing the influence of higher harmonics of the magnetic
</p>
<p>field to the induced electromotive forces. Most often, it is not possible to obtain an
</p>
<p>ideal, sinusoidal distribution of the magnetic field. For this reason, higher harmonics
</p>
<p>are reduced by the proper design of the windings.
</p>
<p>A winding consists of a number of conductors connected in series. In each
</p>
<p>conductor, induced electromotive force depends on the rotor speed and the magnetic
</p>
<p>inductance in the air gap. Whether sinusoidal or not, these electromotive forces
</p>
<p>are periodic, ACwaveforms with their frequency determined by the rotor speed. The
</p>
<p>initial phase of electromotive force induced in a conductor depends upon angular
</p>
<p>position of the slot where the conductor is placed. The electromotive force of the
</p>
<p>winding is the sum of phase-shifted electromotive forces of individual conductors.
</p>
<p>The conductors may be connected in the way that higher harmonics of the electro-
</p>
<p>motive force are in counter phase; thus, they will mutually cancel in the process of
</p>
<p>summing. The phase shift is further dependent upon the order n of harmonic, and this
</p>
<p>makes the process of harmonic elimination more involved. Namely, in cases where a
</p>
<p>winding is made in the way that one higher harmonic is canceled, it is possible that in
</p>
<p>the same process, the other higher harmonic is summed up and augmented.
</p>
<p>10.5 Harmonics 243</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Practical methods of designing the windings specify the way of placing individual
</p>
<p>conductors in various slots. In most cases, all the series-connected conductors along
</p>
<p>with their end turns are made of one single, uninterrupted wire. In such cases, the
</p>
<p>winding design provides a scheme or a map which indicates position and sequence of
</p>
<p>slots where the wire is to be inserted. The winding design relies on the fact that the
</p>
<p>most harm comes from the low-order harmonics. Therefore, most winding design
</p>
<p>schemes are focused on suppressing low-order harmonics.
</p>
<p>The waveform B(y) of the spatial distribution of magnetic induction is usually
</p>
<p>symmetrical with respect to the maximum Bm, and it does not contain even
</p>
<p>harmonics. Therefore, the induced electromotive forces could contain only odd
</p>
<p>harmonics. Moreover, the odd harmonics of the order 3n are not relevant either.
</p>
<p>This claim is briefly explained below.
</p>
<p>For star-connected three-phase windings, the sum of electrical currents is equal
</p>
<p>to zero (ia + ib + ic &frac14; 0). The fundamental components of electrical currents are
phase shifted by 2p/3, which drives their sum to zero. Considering harmonics of the
</p>
<p>order 3n (triplian), their mutual phase shift is 3n � 2p/3 &frac14; n � 2p; hence, they
have the same phase. Therefore, higher triplian harmonics in electrical currents
</p>
<p>cannot exist, as their sum would not be zero. Without the path for electrical
</p>
<p>currents, the higher triplian harmonics in electromotive forces are not relevant as
</p>
<p>they do not produce electrical currents. In a star connection, the electromotive force
</p>
<p>of the phase winding may comprise a triplian harmonic, but it cannot produce any
</p>
<p>electrical current. The phase of triplian harmonics of phase electromotive forces is
</p>
<p>equal due to 3n � 2p/3 &frac14; n � 2p. Therefore, the line voltage, being the difference
between the two phase voltages, will be free from triplian harmonics.
</p>
<p>For the above reasons, practical approaches to winding design are primarily
</p>
<p>focused on suppressing the fifth and seventh harmonic. Where possible, the next
</p>
<p>harmonics to be targeted are the eleventh and thirteenth.
</p>
<p>10.5.1 Electromotive Force in Distributed Winding
</p>
<p>Practical windings of electrical machines are formed by series connecting of the
</p>
<p>conductors placed in slots. Usually, there are several tens of slots, meaning that
</p>
<p>the conductors could be placed at one of several tens of discrete positions. Practical
</p>
<p>windings are designed to have spatial distribution of their conductors as close to
</p>
<p>sinusoidal as possible. Winding design techniques include the use of fractional
</p>
<p>pitch of conductors making one turn (fractional-pitch turns) in order to eliminate or
</p>
<p>reduce some of the higher harmonics. In addition, conductors of the winding
</p>
<p>are distributed in winding belts, comprising a number of adjacent slots, and this
</p>
<p>approach contributes as well to elimination or reduction of higher harmonics in the
</p>
<p>winding electromotive force. For this reason, further considerations are made in
</p>
<p>order to analyze the resultant electromotive force in windings with near-to-sinusoi-
</p>
<p>dal distribution of their conductors along the machine circumference.

<p>244 10 Electromotive Forces</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It will be shown hereafter that an ideal winding with sinusoidal distribution of
</p>
<p>conductors acts as a spatial filter which eliminates completely all the higher
</p>
<p>harmonics of the resulting electromotive force. In cases where the magnetic induc-
</p>
<p>tion B(y) in the air gap has a non-sinusoidal distribution along the machine
</p>
<p>circumference, electromotive forces in individual harmonics are non-sinusoidal as
</p>
<p>well, and they comprise higher-order harmonics. Notwithstanding distortions of B
</p>
<p>(y), the winding with sinusoidal distribution of conductors has a sinusoidal-induced
</p>
<p>electromotive force, free from higher harmonics and distortions. This statement will
</p>
<p>be proved at the end of this chapter. Hence, sinusoidal distribution of conductors is
</p>
<p>an ideal worth striving for. Yet, in practice, it cannot be accomplished since each
</p>
<p>machine has a relatively small number of slots. Therefore, electromotive forces in
</p>
<p>practical machines deviate from an ideal sinusoidal form due to the fact that higher
</p>
<p>harmonics are not completely eliminated.
</p>
<p>In the following considerations, the induced electromotive force is calculated for
</p>
<p>windings where distribution of conductors along the machine circumference is
</p>
<p>assumed to be perfectly sinusoidal. Analysis is focused on electrical machine
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 10.8.
</p>
<p>It has permanent magnets on the rotor. The magnets produce the magnetic
</p>
<p>inductance in the air gap with spatial distribution B(y). The function B(y) is non-
</p>
<p>sinusoidal, and it has higher harmonics. The machine under scope has a stator
</p>
<p>winding with conductors distributed along the inner surface of the stator magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit. It is assumed that each of these conductors can be placed at an arbitrary
</p>
<p>location and that the distribution of the conductors along the circumference is
</p>
<p>sinusoidal. It is going to be proved that in this case, the winding has an induced
</p>
<p>electromotive force that is sinusoidal, even though the field has a non-sinusoidal
</p>
<p>distribution in the air gap. The winding plays the role of a spatial filter which

<p>eliminates all harmonics induced in the electromotive force except for the first,
</p>
<p>fundamental harmonic. Fundamental harmonic of the function B(y) is the first
</p>
<p>member of series (10.25), the member with i &frac14; 1. It represents the first harmonic
of the spatial distribution of the magnetic field. The fundamental harmonic of the
</p>
<p>winding electromotive force is determined from the first harmonic of the distribution
</p>
<p>B(y) and from the angular frequency oS &frac14; Om. Exact expressions are calculated in
this section.
</p>
<p>In general, magnetic field in the air gap can be the consequence of the rotor
</p>
<p>currents or permanent magnets built in the rotor magnetic circuit. In both cases, the
</p>
<p>spatial orientation of the rotor magnetic field depends on the position of the rotor.
</p>
<p>When the rotor revolves at an angular speed ofOm, the rotor magnetic field revolves
</p>
<p>along with the rotor and has the same speed. As a consequence, electromotive forces
</p>
<p>are induced in stator conductors. On the basis of Fig. 10.8, distribution of magnetic
</p>
<p>inductionB(y) in the air gap is not sinusoidal. It contains higher harmonics, specified
</p>
<p>by the series (10.25). Calculation of the resultant electromotive force induced in
</p>
<p>the winding will be carried out with the aim of proving that it contains only the
</p>
<p>fundamental harmonic.
</p>
<p>Magnetic induction created by permanent magnets built in the rotor magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit can be described by function B(y � ym) &frac14; Bmsgn[cos(y � ym)]. Over the
interval � p/2 &lt; (y � ym) &lt; +p/2, the magnetic induction is equal to +Bm, while
for +p/2 &lt; (y � ym) &lt; +3p/2, the induction is�Bm. By expanding this function to
Fourier series, one obtains

</p>
<p>The function contains all odd harmonics, while even harmonics are equal to zero.
</p>
<p>The amplitude of specific harmonics decrease with their order, A ~ 1/(2n � 1). The
absence of even harmonics could have been predicted from the fact that the function
</p>
<p>B(y � ym) is symmetrical, B(x) &frac14; B(�x). The amplitude of the first harmonic is
equal to 4Bm/p.
</p>
<p>10.5.1.1 Flux in One Turn
</p>
<p>Calculation of the electromotive force induced in the stator winding requires the
</p>
<p>flux in the winding to be determined first. Then, the electromotive force can be
</p>
<p>found from the first derivative of the winding flux. Since winding consists of a
</p>
<p>number of series-connected turns, each one in a different position, the total flux is
</p>
<p>obtained by adding (integrating) fluxes in individual turns. First of all, it is neces-
</p>
<p>sary to determine the flux F(y) in one turn. It is assumed that the turn is made of
</p>
<p>conductors A and B. It is also assumed that the conductor A, denoted by
N
</p>
<p>, resides
</p>
<p>at position y, while the conductor B of the same turn, denoted by
J
</p>
<p>, resides at

<p>position y + p. The considered turn has full pitch. Conductors A and B are shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 10.9.
</p>
<p>Flux F(y) is equal to the surface integral of the vector of magnetic induction B
</p>
<p>over the surface Swhich is leaning on the conductors A and B of the considered turn
</p>
<p>(Fig. 10.10). The integral is calculated over the surface which lies in the air gap
</p>
<p>starting from conductor A up to conductor B. The integration surface passing
</p>
<p>through the air gap is selected because there is an analytical expression for the
</p>
<p>change of magnetic induction B in terms of the angle y. The reference direction is
</p>
<p>determined by the right-hand rule. The flux is determined by integrating the

<p>10.5.1.3 Flux of the Winding with Arbitrary Distribution of Conductors
</p>
<p>The previous calculation has been carried out in order to demonstrate that a winding
</p>
<p>with sinusoidal distribution of conductors acts as a spatial filter and removes all the
</p>
<p>higher harmonics from the electromotive force waveform. It is also of interest to
</p>
<p>derive the expression for the winding flux in a more general case, where distribution
</p>
<p>of conductors is described by an arbitrary function N0(y).
The first step in calculating the winding flux is getting the flux in the turn placed
</p>
<p>at position y. This flux is calculated according to expression (10.26),

</p>
<p>where function B(x) determines distribution of the magnetic induction in the air
</p>
<p>gap.
</p>
<p>The total flux is obtained by summing the fluxes of all individual turns. In the
</p>
<p>case of a distributed winding, this summing is performed by integration. In the case
</p>
<p>where line density of conductors is N0(y) &frac14; Nmcosy, the flux of the winding is

<p>10.5.2 Individual Harmonics
</p>
<p>The calculation carried out in this section is focused on deriving the electromotive
</p>
<p>force induced in the stator winding which has sinusoidal distribution of its
</p>
<p>conductors along the machine circumference. The electromotive force is deter-
</p>
<p>mined for the case where permanent magnets of the rotor generate the air gap field
</p>
<p>with non-sinusoidal distribution B(y), comprising higher harmonics. It is started
</p>
<p>with the expression for magnetic induction in the air gap (10.25), which contains
</p>
<p>the first, fundamental harmonic but also all odd harmonics. Since this non-
</p>
<p>sinusoidal distribution of the magnetic induction is symmetrical, the function
</p>
<p>B(y � ym) does not comprise even harmonics. In the considered case, the line
density of stator conductors is N0(y) &frac14; Nmcosy, while the variation of the magnetic
induction in the air gap is given in (10.25). This expression represents a develop-
</p>
<p>ment of the function B(y) into a series comprising only odd members. The first
</p>
<p>element of the series has i &frac14; 1, and it represents the fundamental harmonic of the
spatial distribution of magnetic induction. For i &gt; 1, elements of the series repre-
sent higher harmonics of the spatial distribution of the field. On the basis of
</p>
<p>expression (10.25), spatial harmonic of function B(y) of the order (2i � 1) is

<p>The same conclusion applies for the integral IA if i &gt; 1. Therefore, a nonzero value
of flux CS
</p>
<p>2i�1 exists only for the first (fundamental) harmonic, namely, for i &frac14; 1.
With any i &gt; 1, the integrand function is a sine wave with its period comprised an
integer number of times within the integration domain [�p/2 .. p/2).
</p>
<p>On the basis of the obtained results, it is concluded that a sinusoidal distribution
</p>
<p>of the winding conductors along the machine circumference prevents all the higher
</p>
<p>harmonics of B(y) from affecting the winding flux. For that reasons, the induced
</p>
<p>electromotive force of the winding remains unaffected by higher harmonics in B(y)
</p>
<p>waveform.
</p>
<p>Hence, sinusoidal distribution of conductors results in a winding which
</p>
<p>eliminates all the higher harmonics of the induced electromotive force, retaining
</p>
<p>only the fundamental harmonic.
</p>
<p>10.5.3 Peak and rms of Winding Electromotive Force
</p>
<p>On the basis of the obtained results, the following passages provide the expressions
</p>
<p>for the instantaneous, peak and rms values of the electromotive force induced in the
</p>
<p>considered stator winding. Expressions (10.37), (10.38), and (10.39) apply for
</p>
<p>windings with distribution of conductors N0(y) &frac14; Nm cosy and for distribution of
the magnetic induction in the air gap shown in Fig. 10.8 and described by (10.25).
</p>
<p>10.5.3.1 Suppression of Higher Harmonics
</p>
<p>Results obtained so far indicate that sinusoidal distribution of conductors eliminates
</p>
<p>higher harmonics of the electromotive force induced in a winding. In a winding with
</p>
<p>an ideal, sinusoidal distribution of conductors, a sinusoidal electromotive force is
</p>
<p>induced notwithstanding the higher harmonics in the spatial distribution of magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B(y). Any harmonic of the order (2i � 1) in the spatial distribution of B(y)
gives its contribution ofCS
</p>
<p>2i�1 to the total flux of the winding, and this contribution
is given in expression (10.35). For any i &gt; 1, contribution CS
</p>
<p>2i�1 is equal to zero.
Therefore, the winding performs the role of the spatial filter which eliminates
</p>
<p>the effects of higher harmonics of the spatial distribution of B(y), and it passes
</p>
<p>only the fundamental harmonic.
</p>
<p>10.5.3.2 Winding Flux
</p>
<p>Only the fundamental harmonic of distribution B(y) contributes to the winding flux.
</p>
<p>The winding flux is determined by the following equation:
</p>

<p>If the rotor revolves at a constant speed Om, position of the rotor varies according to

<p>the law ym &frac14; Omt. The flux in the stator winding is then a sinusoidal function of
time with angular frequency oS determined by the angular speed Om of the rotor.

<p>CS&eth;t&THORN; &frac14; 4BmNmLR2 � sinOmt &frac14; CSmax sinOmt:

<p>Question (10.4): Consider the electrical machine which is the subject of the
previous analysis, shown in Fig. 10.8. Assume that the number of conductors does
</p>
<p>not change but that they are concentrated at positions y &frac14; 0 and y &frac14; p. Determine
the shape and amplitude of the electromotive force induced in the stator winding.
</p>
<p>Answer (10.4): Electromotive force e1C &frac14; LvB(y) is induced, in each conductor,
where L is the machine axial length, B(y) is magnetic induction at angular position y
</p>
<p>of the conductor placement, while v &frac14; ROm is the peripheral rotor speed. The speed
v reflects the relative movement of conductors with respect to the field. The spatial
</p>
<p>distribution of magnetic induction B(y) is shown in Fig. 10.8. Therefore, a complex
</p>
<p>periodic electromotive force is induced with rectangular shape and with the period
</p>
<p>and frequency determined by the rotor speed. The conductors of the concentrated
</p>
<p>winding are placed at positions y &frac14; 0 and y &frac14; p. Since B(0) &frac14; �B(p), the
electromotive forces induced in diametrical conductors are of the opposite signs.
</p>
<p>The way of connecting a pair of conductors into one turn leads to subtracting of
</p>
<p>the respective electromotive forces. Subtracting the two values of the same ampli-
</p>
<p>tude and of the opposite sign results in electromotive force in one turn e1T which
</p>
<p>is twice larger than e1C. Hence, the electromotive force induced in one turn is equal
</p>
<p>to e1T &frac14; 2 e1C &frac14; 2 LROm B(0). For a concentrated winding with N turns, the
electromotive force of the winding is equal to ew &frac14; 2 NLROm B(0). It has the
shape of a train of rectangular pulses with an amplitude of
</p>
<p>emaxw &frac14; 2OmBmaxNkLR:
</p>
<p>Using the relations expressed in (10.25), the maximum value of the first harmonic
</p>
<p>of this train of rectangular pulses is 4/p times higher than the amplitude of the pulses.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the rms value of the first harmonic of the electromotive force induced in
</p>
<p>the concentrated winding is equal to

<p>Question (10.5): Consider electrical machine where permanent magnets on the
rotor create magnetic induction with sinusoidal distribution in the air gap, B(y) &frac14;
Bmcos(y � ym), where ym is displacement of the rotor with respect to the stator. The
stator winding has NT turns, hence 2NT conductors. The winding can be realized in
</p>
<p>two ways. The first way is forming a concentrated winding having conductors
</p>
<p>located at positions y &frac14; 0 and y &frac14; p. The other way of making the winding is to
have sinusoidal distribution of conductors, with the conductor density N0(y) &frac14;

</p>
<p>maximum value of the stator flux CS(ym) in both cases. Geometry of the machine

<p>is the same as the one considered in Question 10.4.

<p>Chapter 11
</p>
<p>Introduction to DC Machines
</p>
<p>Prior to commissioning the first electrical power stations, electrical energy was
</p>
<p>mostly obtained from batteries, chemical sources of electrical current. The batteries
</p>
<p>provide DC voltages and currents at their output terminals. It is for this reason that
</p>
<p>the first experiments and applications of electrical machines have been made with
</p>
<p>DC current electrical machines. Electrical engineers have studied the principles of
</p>
<p>operation of these machines and analyzed their characteristics, and they found the
</p>
<p>way of designing and manufacturing DC machines.
</p>
<p>At first, the processes of production, transmission, and application of electrical
</p>
<p>energy were based on DC voltages and currents. All the tasks of electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversion were employing DC machines. Electric power stations were built in
</p>
<p>close vicinity of industrial facilities, cities, and other major consumers of electrical
</p>
<p>energy. The energy obtained from water or steam turbines used to be converted to
</p>
<p>electrical energy by means of electrical machines providing DC voltages and
</p>
<p>currents, also called DC generators. At their output terminals, most DC generators
</p>
<p>produced DC voltages of several hundred volts. By using a pair of conductors,
</p>
<p>electrical power was transmitted over short distances of 1&ndash;2 km and delivered to
</p>
<p>consumers. Early consumers of electrical energy have been designed to operate
</p>
<p>with DC voltages and currents. Electrical lighting bulbs have been made to convert
</p>
<p>electrical energy into light, while DC motors have been producing controlled
</p>
<p>mechanical work put to use in production processes.
</p>
<p>Designing DC generators and motors for voltages in excess of 1,000 V involves
</p>
<p>technical difficulties that will be explained later on. As a consequence, DC
</p>
<p>generators and motors were manufactured and used for relatively low DC
</p>
<p>voltages U. Therefore, transmission and distribution of electrical power P involved
</p>
<p>very high currents due to I &frac14; P/U. Transmission of power of 1 MW required
electrical currents in excess of 1,000 A. Electrical conductors in transmission lines
</p>
<p>were designed with very large cross sections in order to reduce the line resistance R.
</p>
<p>Such transmission was accompanied with considerable losses (RI2) and large volt-
</p>
<p>age drops (RI). Higher transmission voltage U leads to lower line current I &frac14; P/U
and, hence, lower losses and lower voltage drop. Yet, at that time, the maximumDC

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>voltages available at generator terminals were rather limited. At the same time, there
</p>
<p>were no DC/DC power converters capable of transforming a low voltage, obtained
</p>
<p>from DC generators, into a high DC voltage, suitable for power transmission.
</p>
<p>Contemporary systems for production, transmission, and distribution of electrical
</p>
<p>energy make use of alternating currents (AC) with frequencies of 50 or 60 Hz.
</p>
<p>By using power transformers, a relatively low voltage produced by AC generators
</p>
<p>is increased to several hundreds of thousands of volts. Most AC transmission lines
</p>
<p>are three-phase, with line-to-line voltages of 110, 220, 400, or 700 kV. Electrical
</p>
<p>currents in transmission lines are therefore reduced, along with the losses and
</p>
<p>voltage drops. With P &frac14; 100 MW and Ul &frac14; 400 kV, the line current is lower than
150 A. In the vicinity of consumers, high voltage at transmission lines is transformed
</p>
<p>by means of power transformers and scaled down to the level suitable for consumers
</p>
<p>(220 V). A power transformer changes voltage level according to transformation
</p>
<p>ratiom &frac14; N1/N2, defined by the number of turns of primary and secondary windings.
DC voltage cannot be transformed by power transformers. Recent developments
</p>
<p>in power electronics over the past couple of decades resulted in high power, high
</p>
<p>voltage static power converters required for DC power transmission. These devices
</p>
<p>were not available at the wake of electrical power systems. Therefore, DC voltage
</p>
<p>across generator terminals in the early power stations used to be fed to transmission
</p>
<p>lines without any conversion. The same voltage was made available to electrical
</p>
<p>loads, connected by distribution lines. Low DC voltages at transmission lines
</p>
<p>resulted in large currents, large voltage drops, and heavy losses. In order to keep
</p>
<p>the losses and voltage drops relatively low, transmission of electrical power over
</p>
<p>DC lines was feasible only at short distances.
</p>
<p>Nowadays, electrical power generation, transmission, distribution, and consump-
</p>
<p>tion are based on AC voltages and currents. Processes of electromechanical conver-
</p>
<p>sion involve AC generators and motors. Therefore, the use of DC generators and
</p>
<p>motors is declining. DC electrical machines are being replaced by AC machines.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is of interest to study DC machines as the first electrical machines
</p>
<p>that were widely used. Moreover, their relatively simple model makes them suitable
</p>
<p>for introducing basic principles, notions, and characteristics of electrical machines.
</p>
<p>While studying DC machines within the following three chapters, the reader gets
</p>
<p>acquainted with mechanical characteristics, steady-state operating area, transient
</p>
<p>characteristics, steady-state equivalent circuits, dynamic models, analysis of losses,
</p>
<p>power supply and controls, and other tasks, problems, and phenomena involved with
</p>
<p>application of electrical machines.
</p>
<p>This chapter starts with description and principles of operation of DC motors and
</p>
<p>generators. Some basic information concerning the design of DC machines is
</p>
<p>presented as well. Analysis includes the operation of mechanical commutator, key
</p>
<p>component of DC machines, which converts DC currents into AC currents. This
</p>
<p>device receives DC current from electrical source and conducts them into rotor
</p>
<p>conductors. Due to mechanical commutation, rotor currents depend on rotor position.
</p>
<p>At constant speed, rotor conductors have AC current with their angular frequency
</p>
<p>determined by the speed. Some basic ways of forming the rotor winding and

<p>260 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>connecting the rotor conductors with the commutator are shown as well. This chapter
</p>
<p>ends with analytical expressions for electromagnetic torque and electromotive force.
</p>
<p>Mathematical model of the machine is developed within the next chapters,
</p>
<p>describing the machine behavior during transients. On the basis of the steady-
</p>
<p>state analysis, the equivalent circuit is introduced and explained. It allows calcula-
</p>
<p>tion of the current, flux, and torque of DC machine in the steady state, where the
</p>
<p>supply voltage and the rotor speed are constant and known. Within these chapters,
</p>
<p>mechanical characteristic is derived, expressing the steady-state relation of the
</p>
<p>speed and the torque. Losses in windings and magnetic circuits are analyzed
</p>
<p>along with processes of heating and the ways of heat removal (cooling). The
</p>
<p>maximum permissible steady-state current, power, and torque are introduced and
</p>
<p>explained, as well as the rated values of relevant. The field-weakening operation is
</p>
<p>introduced and explained, as well as relevant relations and characteristics. Transient
</p>
<p>and steady-state operating areas are determined from the torque-speed pairs attain-
</p>
<p>able during transients and in the steady state.
</p>
<p>11.1 Construction and Principle of Operation
</p>
<p>DCmachines consist of the stator magnetic circuit, rotor magnetic circuit, and rotor
</p>
<p>winding. The stator may have stator winding, called excitation winding, or perma-
</p>
<p>nent magnets. The stator flux is created either by permanent magnets in stator
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit or by DC currents in the stator winding. Currents in rotor
</p>
<p>conductors create the rotor magnetomotive force. In the preceding chapter, it has
</p>
<p>been shown that the vector product of two fluxes
</p>
<p>~Tem &frac14; k ~FR � ~FS
h i
</p>
<p>determines the electromagnetic torque of an electrical machine. Thus, the torque of
</p>
<p>a DC machine is determined by the vector product of the stator and rotor fluxes. The
</p>
<p>torque vector is collinear with the axis of the machine.
</p>
<p>11.2 Construction of the Stator
</p>
<p>The stator flux is called excitation flux, and it is obtained from direct electrical
</p>
<p>currents in the stator winding. The excitation flux can also be created by permanent
</p>
<p>magnets built in the stator magnetic circuit. The case when the excitation flux is
</p>
<p>obtained by the stator excitation winding is called electromagnetic excitation. Stator
</p>
<p>winding carries a direct current (DC) which creates stator magnetomotive force and
</p>
<p>stator flux. Since the stator carries a DC current, the stator flux does not move.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Instead of stator winding, DC machine can have permanent magnets built in the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit of the stator. Permanent magnets have significant remanent induc-
</p>
<p>tion Br even in cases with no external field H. With permanent magnets, stator flux
</p>
<p>is obtained without any need to build a stator winding. In Fig. 11.1, lines of the
</p>
<p>stator field start from the north magnetic pole and propagate toward the south
</p>
<p>magnetic pole, passing along their way through the rotor.
</p>
<p>11.3 Separately Excited Machines
</p>
<p>Many DC machines have excitation that does not change with rotor currents. These
</p>
<p>machines are called separately excited machines. They include DC machines with
</p>
<p>permanent magnets, where the rotor currents do not affect the excitation flux caused
</p>
<p>by the magnets. They also include DC machines with the stator excitation winding
</p>
<p>fed from a separate electrical source, decoupled from the rotor supply.
</p>
<p>In other types of DC machines, the stator excitation gets affected by the rotor
</p>
<p>currents. If the stator winding (i.e., the excitation winding) is connected in series
</p>
<p>with the rotor winding, the excitation current equals the rotor current. This type of
</p>
<p>electrical machine is called series excited DC machine or series DC motor. The
</p>
<p>excitation can depend on the rotor current in other ways. The excitation (stator)
</p>
<p>winding can be connected in parallel with the rotor winding. As the rotor voltage
</p>
<p>changes with the rotor currents, the excitation voltage and current would change
</p>
<p>with the rotor current as well. There are also DC machines where both series and
</p>
<p>parallel excitations are present.
</p>
<p>Separately excited DC machines are the main subject of the study within this
</p>
<p>chapter.

<p>11.4 Current in Rotor Conductors
</p>
<p>Rotor of DC machine has axially set conductors carrying electrical currents.
</p>
<p>Through interaction with magnetic induction of the excitation field, the rotor
</p>
<p>conductors are exposed to electromagnetic force. A couple of forces create mechan-
</p>
<p>ical torque that acts on the rotor and incites motion. Due to specific construction of
</p>
<p>DCmachines and the presence of mechanical commutator, which directs the electri-
</p>
<p>cal current into rotor conductors, direction of the current in conductors below the
</p>
<p>north magnetic pole (N) does not change. It remains the same despite the fact that
</p>
<p>the rotor revolves. Direction of the current in the conductors below the south pole (S)
</p>
<p>is opposite to the one in the conductors which are below the north pole.
</p>
<p>Conductors 1 and 2 are built in the rotor slots, and they revolve at the same speed as
</p>
<p>the rotor does. With rotor making one half turn (Fig. 11.2b), conductors 1 and
</p>
<p>2 exchange their places. In order to have a positive torque, it is necessary to change
</p>
<p>directions of the currents in conductors, as shown in the Figure. In conductor 1, the
</p>
<p>direction was � while it was in the zone of the north pole of the stator. When this
conductor comes to the zone of the south pole, it has to carry a current of direction� so
that the torque remains positive. Similar conclusion may be drawn for conductor 2.
</p>
<p>Conductors 1 and 2 constitute one contour (turn) of the rotor. When the rotor
</p>
<p>revolves at a speedOm, it makes one revolution each T &frac14; 2p/Om. For the purpose of
creating a torque which would not change sign but remain positive instead, current
</p>

ym &frac14; 0. Rotor conductor 1 in the zone of the north pole of the stator and conductor 2 below the
south pole of the stator. (b) Rotor shifted to position ym &frac14; p. Conductors 1 and 2 have exchanged
their places

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>through the considered contour should change sign synchronously with the rotor
</p>
<p>movement. The current should be positive during time interval T/2 &frac14; p/Om and
then negative during the next interval of T/2. Therefore, current in the rotor has to
</p>
<p>be periodic with the period T determined by the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>The ways of directing the rotor currents into conductors so as to obtain periodic
</p>
<p>electrical currents will be put aside at this time. By considering Fig. 11.2 and
</p>
<p>assuming that, notwithstanding the rotor motion, electrical current in rotor conduc-
</p>
<p>tor below the north pole retains direction �, while the conductor below the south
pole always has direction of the current �, the rotor magnetomotive force and flux
can be represented by vectors directed downward. On the other hand, vector of the
</p>
<p>stator field is horizontal, directed from left to right. It is concluded that the angle
</p>
<p>between the two fluxes is constant and equal to p/2, irrespective of the speed and
</p>
<p>direction of the rotor motion. This fulfills the optimal condition for creating
</p>
<p>constant torque.
</p>
<p>Considered pair of rotor conductors is in the region under the stator poles. Coupled
</p>
<p>forces producing positive torque act upon conductors 1 and 2 (Fig. 11.2a). This torque
</p>
<p>supports counterclockwise movement. The electromagnetic torque is determined by
</p>
<p>(11.1) where l is length of one conductor, B is magnetic induction in the zones of the
</p>
<p>stator magnetic poles, and D is rotor diameter.

</p>
<p>11.5 Mechanical Commutator
</p>
<p>Rotor currents in a DC machine are obtained from DC power sources. The source
</p>
<p>current is fed to a mechanical commutator. The rotating part of the commutator is
</p>
<p>called collector, while the stator part of the commutator has two carbon brushes
</p>
<p>usually designated by A and B. External power supply that feeds the rotor winding
</p>
<p>has its positive pole connected to the brush A and its negative pole to the brush B.
</p>
<p>Attached to the stator, the brushes do not move. The collector is fastened to the rotor
</p>
<p>shaft and rotates at the same speed as the rotor. Owing to this, the still carbon
</p>
<p>brushes, positioned diametrically, slide along collector ring. A collector ring is
</p>
<p>divided into a number of mutually insulated segments. The collector segments are
</p>
<p>called commutator segments or collector segments. The segments have electrical
</p>
<p>connection to rotor turns in the manner to be described later.
</p>
<p>DC current from an external DC source is fed to diametrically positioned
</p>
<p>brushes A and B. Immobile brushes lean on the collector segments, directing in
</p>
<p>this way current into the rotor conductors. When the rotor moves, the brushes slide
</p>
<p>from one pair of the collector segments to the next pair. As a consequence, a change
</p>
<p>264 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>occurs in distribution of electrical current in rotor conductors. The end result is
</p>
<p>that, notwithstanding the rotor motion, the rotor currents create the magnetomotive
</p>
<p>force vector FR12 which does not move with respect to the stator, as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.2. The rotor magnetomotive force gives a rise to the rotor flux, which does
</p>
<p>not move either.
</p>
<p>Mechanical commutator converts DC currents, obtained from the power supply
of the rotor winding, to periodic currents carried by rotor conductors. Frequency of
</p>
<p>these currents is determined by the speed of rotation. The role of the mechanical
</p>
<p>commutator is similar to that of static power converters called inverters, which
</p>
<p>employ power transistor switches and convert DC voltages and currents into AC
</p>
<p>voltages and currents. The change of voltages and currents in conductors of the rotor
</p>
<p>equipped with mechanical commutator is similar to the change of voltages and
</p>
<p>currents in a system comprising DC supplied inverter which feeds AC currents
</p>
<p>and supplies asynchronous or synchronous machines.
</p>
<p>In modern applications of electrical machines, DC machines with mechanical
</p>
<p>commutator are replaced by static power converters (transistor inverters) feeding
</p>
<p>asynchronous or synchronous machines, also called AC machines.
</p>
<p>The method of making of rotor winding as well as the method of connecting this
</p>
<p>winding to collector may be relatively involved. A detailed study of different
</p>
<p>methods of realization of rotor windings of DC machines is beyond the scope of
</p>
<p>this book. For the purpose of understanding the operation of mechanical commuta-
</p>
<p>tor, further discussion presents an analysis of some relatively simple examples,
</p>
<p>intended for illustration of basic functions of mechanical collector.
</p>
<p>11.6 Rotor Winding
</p>
<p>Figure 11.3 shows a rotor having only one turn. It is made of conductors 1 and 2
</p>
<p>connected in series. The conductors are in electrical connection with collector which
</p>
<p>has segments S1 and S2. Such collector can bemade from ametal cylinder by cutting
</p>
<p>it in two mutually insulated halves. The front end of conductor 1 is connected to
</p>
<p>segment S1, while the front end of conductor 2 is connected to segment S2. At the
</p>
<p>rear end of the rotor, the ends of conductors 1 and 2 are brought together by the end
</p>
<p>turn. Brushes A and B are connected to a current source supplying electrical current
</p>
<p>i(t). In the given position, brushes A and B lean on segments S1 and S2, respectively.
</p>
<p>Therefore, there is electrical contact between the brush and the segment that gets in
</p>
<p>touch with it. At position presented in the figure, current in conductor 1 has direction
</p>
<p>�, while current in conductor 2 has direction �. When the rotor moves by p,
conductors exchange their places. At the same time, the segments S1 and S2 change
</p>
<p>their places as well, as they are fastened to the rotor and revolve along with the rotor.
</p>
<p>Now conductor 1 gets under the south pole (left), but direction of the electrical
</p>
<p>current in this conductor is changed. Therefore, the electrical current in rotor con-
</p>
<p>ductor under the north pole retains direction �, while the current in rotor conductor
under the south pole retains direction �. Mechanical commutator insures that the
</p>
<p>11.6 Rotor Winding 265</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>current distribution under the stator poles remains the same for any position of the
</p>
<p>rotor, notwithstanding its relative motion.
</p>
<p>Current in each of conductors changes direction synchronously with the rotor
</p>
<p>motion. The commutator with its brushes and two-segment collector converts DC
</p>
<p>current of the source into periodic current in the rotor conductors. One revolution of
</p>
<p>the rotor corresponds to one period of alternating currents in rotor conductors. As a
</p>
<p>consequence, the observer at the stator side (i.e., the observer which does not move
</p>
<p>with respect to the stator) does not see any motion of the rotor magnetomotive
</p>
<p>force. Namely, the rotor conductors below the north magnetic pole, designated by N
</p>
<p>in Fig. 11.4, retain the current direction, while the conductors below the south pole
</p>
<p>S retain direction �. This distribution remains unaltered in spite of the fact that the
rotor and rotor conductors move.
</p>
<p>In practice, rotor winding has a number of turns evenly distributed along the rotor
</p>
<p>perimeter. The conductors are connected to respective segments of the collector.
</p>
<p>A collector ring may have a number of mutually insulated segments which are
</p>
<p>galvanically connected to two or more conductors. Current ia is fed to the rotor by
</p>
<p>means of a couple of carbon brushes which are in touch with the collector and which
</p>
<p>pass the electrical current to the segments. The commutator directs the current to the
</p>
<p>rotor conductors in such way that distribution of the rotor currents corresponds to
</p>
<p>the one shown in Fig. 11.4. Said distribution does not change notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>rotor motion. It should be noted that the rotor turns along with the rotor conductors.
</p>
<p>Due to the action of mechanical commutator, the rotor has alternating currents and
</p>
<p>they create the rotor current sheet which does not revolve but remains still with
</p>
<p>respect to the stator. In Fig. 11.4, direction of the rotor magnetomotive force and the
</p>
<p>rotor flux is vertical, irrespective of the rotor position. Therefore, the rotor flux
</p>
<p>remains still with respect to the stator, and the angle between the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>flux vectors is p/2. DC machines usually have a relatively large number of the rotor
</p>
<p>conductors and corresponding number of collector segments. Appearance of the
</p>
<p>rotor of a typical DC machine is shown in Fig. 11.5.

<p>Figure 11.6 shows the method of connecting rotor conductors to the collector
</p>
<p>segments for DC machine with 4 rotor slot, 4 collector segments, and 8 conductors.
</p>
<p>Given example is seldom seen in practice. The number of rotor slots is usually much
</p>
<p>higher. Yet, the case in Fig. 11.6 is selected as an introduction to making the rotor
</p>
<p>winding. Conductors P1&ndash;P8 are placed in slots. Each slot houses two conductors. The
</p>
<p>rotor is observed from the side where the mechanical collector is mounted on
</p>
<p>the shaft. The ends of conductors P1&ndash;P8 are connected as well on the rotor side
</p>
<p>opposite to mechanical collector, the rare side of the machine. This side is not visible.
</p>
<p>Therefore, relevant wire connections at the rare side are shown in the right-hand side
</p>
<p>of Figure 11.6 by dotted lines. Connected by rare side connections, conductors make
</p>
<p>four turns, P1&ndash;P2, P3&ndash;P4, P5&ndash;P6, and P7&ndash;P8. At the front side of the rotor, where the
</p>
<p>mechanical collector is mounted, wire connections are represented in the left-hand
</p>
<p>side of Fig. 11.6 by solid lines.

<p>Segment L1 of the collector is connected to conductors P8 and P1, segment L2 to
</p>
<p>conductors P2 and P3, segment L3 to conductors P4 and P5, and segment L4
</p>
<p>to conductors P6 and P7. Connections of the segments with relevant conductors
</p>
<p>are at the front side, represented by solid lines, while the connections of conductor
</p>
<p>ends at the rear side of the rotor are drawn by dotted lines. In the considered rotor
</p>
<p>position, brushes A and B are in touch with segments L1 and L3; thus, the current of
</p>
<p>the source ia is split in two parallel paths, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Each of the rotor
</p>
<p>conductors carries electrical current of ia/2.
</p>
<p>In all the conductors below the north magnetic pole of the stator, direction of
</p>
<p>electrical current is�, while in conductors below the south magnetic pole, direction
is �. If the rotor is turned by p/2, brush A comes in touch with segment L4, while
brush B touches segment L2. Connections between the conductors and segments
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 11.6 can be used to determine direction of currents in rotor conductors
</p>
<p>after the rotor moves. Due to rotation, conductors will change their position. At the

<p>268 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>same time, direction will change in some of them due to mechanical commutator.
</p>
<p>Finally, direction of currents in conductors below the north magnetic pole remains�
even after the rotor has moved, while in conductors below the south pole direction
</p>
<p>remains �. The way of making the rotor winding and connecting the segments
ensures that direction� is preserved in all conductors under the north magnetic pole,
notwithstanding the rotor motion. In every single conductor, direction changes and
</p>
<p>becomes� as the conductor passes from the zone under the north pole into the zone
below the south magnetic pole. In the course of rotation, the rotor conductors have
</p>
<p>alternating currents with frequency determined by the speed of rotation.
</p>
<p>Wiring diagram of the rotor current circuit can be presented in the manner shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 11.8. The figure shows the rotor with rather simple construction, having 4
</p>
<p>slots, 8 conductors, and mechanical commutator with 4 segments. Commutator
</p>
<p>allows creation of the rotor current sheet which does not rotate with respect to the
</p>
<p>stator, producing in this way vectors of the rotor magnetomotive force and flux
</p>
<p>which do not move with respect to the stator. The power supply to the rotor winding
</p>
<p>is shown in Figs. 11.6 and 11.7 as a constant current source connected to brushes A
</p>
<p>and B.
</p>
<p>In the course of the rotor motion, the brushes direct the current to collector
</p>
<p>segments and subsequently to the rotor conductors. As the rotor conductor moves
</p>
<p>below the north pole and passes under the south pole, direction of electrical current
</p>
<p>changes. For that reason, each rotor conductor has alternating current with a fre-
</p>
<p>quency determined by the speed of rotation. Observed from the stator side, distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of the rotor currents remains unaltered. Therefore, the rotor currents create a
</p>
<p>current sheet which does not move with respect to the stator. Rotor currents are
</p>
<p>shown by signs � and � in Fig. 11.7, and they create the rotor flux which
can be represented by the vector of vertical direction, standing at an angle of p/2
</p>
<p>with respect to the stator field. According to the right-hand rule, the rotor flux is
</p>
<p>directed downward.

<p>11.6 Rotor Winding 269</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.7 Commutation
</p>
<p>As shown in the previous example, the rotor conductors below the north magnetic
</p>
<p>pole of the stator have electrical current in direction �, while conductors below the
south magnetic pole have direction �. In the course of rotation, each of the rotor
conductors resides below north magnetic pole during one half turn and below the
</p>
<p>south magnetic pole under the second half turn. Therefore, direction of electrical
</p>
<p>current in each individual conductor changes with a frequency determined by the
</p>
<p>speed of rotation. Carbon brushes A and B are fastened to the stator, and they touch
</p>
<p>the segments of the collector, passing the DC current received from the power
</p>
<p>supply ia. During rotation, the brushes touch the segments which are below them at
</p>
<p>each particular instant. Hence, the segments slide under the brushes. Brush transi-
</p>
<p>tion from one segment to the next is followed by change in electrical current in rotor
</p>
<p>conductors attached to relevant segments. Directing DC current ia by collector
</p>
<p>action results in alternating currents in the rotor conductors. Transition of the brush
</p>
<p>from one segment to the other and consequential change in electrical current in
</p>
<p>rotor conductors is called commutation. In the course of transition, one brush
</p>
<p>touches two segments at the same time, bringing them into short circuit and short
</p>
<p>circuiting the rotor turns connected to relevant segments. The case when brush A
</p>
<p>simultaneously touches segments L1 and L2 is shown in Fig. 11.9.
</p>
<p>Advancing from position given in Fig. 11.8 in clockwise direction, toward
</p>
<p>position given in Fig. 11.9, the rotor moves by p/4. Since the brush A in Fig. 11.9
</p>
<p>makes a short circuit between segments L1 and L2, while the brush B makes a short
</p>
<p>circuit between segments L3 and L4, turns P1&ndash;P2 and P5&ndash;P6 are short-circuited
</p>
<p>during commutation. If the rotor makes further move by p/4 in the same direction, it
</p>
<p>arrives at position shown in Fig. 11.10. With respect to Fig. 11.8, the rotor position
</p>
<p>is changed by p/2 in clockwise direction, and now the brush A has contact with
</p>
<p>segment L2. Wiring diagram of Fig. 11.10 should be compared with the wiring
</p>
<p>diagrams in Figs. 11.6 and 11.7.
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.9 Short circuit of rotor turns during commutation
</p>
<p>270 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For the considered rotor, commutation repeats four times per each mechanical
</p>
<p>turn. It is necessary to analyze the problems associated with periodic short circuits of
</p>
<p>the rotor turns in the process of commutation. Starting from the scheme of placing
</p>
<p>the rotor conductors into slots, shown in Fig. 11.6, it is concluded that, during
</p>
<p>commutation shown in Fig. 11.9, the turns P1&ndash;P2 and P5&ndash;P6 get short-circuited.
</p>
<p>At the same time, conductors P1, P2, P5, and P6 pass through the zone between the
</p>
<p>stator magnetic poles, halfway between the north and south pole, where the radial
</p>
<p>component of magnetic induction is small and changes sign. The place where the
</p>
<p>short-circuited turns are found during commutation is shown in Fig. 11.11, where
</p>
<p>the remaining turns are omitted. Contribution of stator excitation to magnetic
</p>
<p>induction in the air gap is the highest in the middle of stator magnetic poles.
</p>
<p>At places where conductors P1, P2, P5, and P6 are found in Fig. 11.11, the radial
</p>
<p>component of magnetic induction is close to zero. Therefore, the electromotive
</p>
<p>forces induced in these conductors are close to zero. As a consequence, short
</p>
<p>circuiting these turns does not produce any significant short circuit currents.

<p>11.7 Commutation 271</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In practice, DC machines usually have considerably higher number of segments,
</p>
<p>rotor slots, and rotor conductors. Collector segments are then connected to rotor
</p>
<p>conductors in the manner explained later on. Whatever the number of segments, the
</p>
<p>process of commutation occurs when carbon brushes A and B pass from one
</p>
<p>collector segment to the other. The collector revolves along with the rotor, and its
</p>
<p>segments slide below the brushes at the speed determined by the rotor motion.
</p>
<p>The number of commutations during one mechanical turn of the rotor is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the number of segments, and there are usually several tens of them. In all
</p>
<p>versions of the rotor construction, collector segments are connected to rotor
</p>
<p>conductors. The latter are connected in series, and they form turns. Several series-
</p>
<p>connected turns can be made, and they are also called section. Hence, one part of the
</p>
<p>rotor winding is connected between each pair of neighboring segments, and this
</p>
<p>part can be a single turn or a multiple turn section. Whenever the brush touches
</p>
<p>two adjacent segments, considered part of the rotor winding gets short-circuited.
</p>
<p>The short circuit current between the adjacent segments is established through the
</p>
<p>brushes. The current depends on the electromotive force induced in the short-
</p>
<p>circuited turns and the equivalent impedance of these turns. For this reason, it is of
</p>
<p>uttermost importance to have a very low or none electromotive force in short-
</p>
<p>circuited windings. For that to achieve, DC machines are designed and made so
</p>
<p>that there is no electromotive force in the rotor turns while they get short-circuited by
</p>
<p>brushes. An electromotive force in a short-circuited turn would lead to short circuit
</p>
<p>currents through the brushes, sparking, electric arc, and eventually damage of both
</p>
<p>brushes and collector.
</p>
<p>Figure 11.11 illustrates the commutation process in a machine with 4 segments
</p>
<p>and 4 rotor slots. The turns brought into short circuit by the brushes are in the region
</p>
<p>between stator magnetic poles, where the radial component of the magnetic induc-
</p>
<p>tion has negligible values. The same effect should be accomplished in all DC
</p>
<p>machines. In machines having a large number of rotor segments, brushes may be
</p>
<p>wider and extend over two or more segments. In this case, several segments are
</p>
<p>brought into short circuit by one brush. All conductors belonging to short-circuited
</p>
<p>turns in the course of commutation have to be away from the stator magnetic poles,
</p>
<p>in the region between the poles, where the induction is negligible. The area between
</p>
<p>the magnetic poles is called neutral zone. This will be dealt with in the subsequent

<p>11.8 Operation of Commutator
</p>
<p>Mechanical commutator of DC machines performs the function of converting DC
</p>
<p>currents, supplied from DC power source via brushes, into periodic currents which
</p>
<p>exist in rotor conductors. Change of the current in rotor conductors is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.12b. Direction of this current changes synchronously with the rotor motion.
</p>
<p>Between the commutation intervals, denoted by shaded areas in the figure, the
</p>
<p>current ic is equal either to &thorn;ia/2 or �ia/2. The commutation intervals are relatively
</p>
<p>272 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>short with respect to the period. Thus, the shape of rotor currents is close to a train
</p>
<p>of rectangular pulses having amplitude ia/2. Rotor currents are not sinusoidal.
</p>
<p>Current ip in Fig. 11.12b is a symmetrical, periodic current with average value
</p>
<p>equal to zero.1
</p>
<p>Therefore, the commutator shown in Fig. 11.12a is a mechanical converter
</p>
<p>which converts DC currents to alternating currents (AC). Frequency of currents
</p>
<p>carried by rotor conductors is determined by the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>In cases where DC machine is used as generator, rotor is put to motion by means
</p>
<p>of driving torque obtained from a water turbine or steam turbine. Rotor conductors
</p>
<p>revolve in magnetic field created by stator excitation. Relevant magnetic induction
</p>
<p>is proportional to the stator flux. Electromotive forces induced in rotor conductors
</p>
<p>are proportional to magnetic induction and peripheral speed. Under the north pole,
</p>
<p>magnetic induction has opposite direction with respect to that under the south
</p>
<p>pole. For this reason, electromotive forces induced in conductors below the two
</p>
<p>poles have different signs. While the rotor turns, each rotor conductor passes below
</p>
<p>stator poles with a period determined by the rotor speed. Therefore, electromotive
</p>
<p>force induced in a single conductor changes periodically. Its average value is equal
</p>
<p>to zero while its frequency depends on the rotor speed. Sample electromotive force
</p>
<p>induced in one conductor due to rotor motion is shown in Fig. 11.12b. It is shown in
</p>
<p>following sections that AC electromotive forces in rotor conductors result in a DC
</p>
<p>electromotive voltage measured between brushes A and B. This AC/DC conversion
</p>
<p>of voltages takes place due to the action of mechanical commutator which adds
</p>
<p>the AC electromotive forces in individual rotor conductors in such way that a DC
</p>
<p>electromotive force appears between the brushes. Hence, the commutator acts as a
</p>
<p>rectifier.

<p>1 In a broader sense, it is possible to call it alternating current. Strictly speaking, only sinusoidal
</p>
<p>functions of time are understood as alternating currents, called sinusoidal or harmonic currents.

<p>11.9 Making the Rotor Winding
</p>
<p>For better understanding of DC machines and for studying the function of the
</p>
<p>mechanical commutator, this section studies a sample rotor winding with 8 slots
</p>
<p>and 8 conductors connected to mechanical commutator with 4 collector segments
</p>
<p>and two brushes. To facilitate understanding of the way the conductors are
</p>
<p>connected to the collector, it is necessary to present rotor winding in unfolded
</p>
<p>form, quite similar to unwrapping the rotor cylindrical surface and presenting it in
</p>
<p>the form of a flat rectangle. This presentation can be obtained by a thought experi-
</p>
<p>ment wherein the rotor cylinder is cut along the radius denoted by dotted line in
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.13a. It is necessary to imagine that the cylindrical rotor surface is being
</p>
<p>unfolded in the way shown in Fig. 11.13b. Finally, by bringing the cylindrical
</p>
<p>surface to a plane, unfolded form is obtained, given in Fig. 11.13c. Rotor conductors
</p>
<p>are shown on this unfolded drawing with magnetic poles of the stator shown on the
</p>
<p>top. It should be noted that conductors P1&ndash;P4 are shown under the north magnetic
</p>
<p>pole, as they are in Fig. 11.13a.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 11.15, the segments are denoted by L1&ndash;L4, while the conductors are
</p>
<p>denoted by P1&ndash;P8. Conductors P1&ndash;P4 carry electrical currents in direction �, and
they reside under the north stator pole. Conductors P5&ndash;P8 carry electrical currents
</p>
<p>in direction�, and they reside under the south stator pole. While denoting direction
of electrical currents, it is assumed that the reader is at the front side of the rotor,
</p>
<p>looking at the mechanical collector, as shown in Fig. 11.14. Sign � designates
electrical current directed from front part (collector) to the rear part of the rotor,
</p>
<p>while sign � designates electrical current directed from the rear part of the rotor
toward the front side and toward the reader.
</p>
<p>The four segments shown in the figure can be obtained by splitting a metal ring
</p>
<p>into four equal arcs and by putting electric insulation layers in between. The segments
</p>
<p>can also be presented in unfolded form, using the same approach (Fig. 11.15).
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the width of the unfolded drawing corresponds to the rotor
</p>
<p>circumference, namely, the unfolded drawing is 2p wide. One can also consider that
</p>
<p>the horizontal axis in Fig. 11.15 corresponds to angular change from 0 (left) to
</p>
<p>2p (right). Unfolded presentation in Fig. 11.15 shows the conductors, brushes, and
</p>
<p>collector segments. On the top is the position of the magnetic poles. The poles (N, S)

<p>and the brushes (A, B) do not move. In Fig. 11.15, the rotor motion can be envisaged
</p>
<p>as a parallel transition of conductors P1&ndash;P8 and segments L1&ndash;L4 toward left or right.
</p>
<p>At considered position, conductors P1&ndash;P4 are below the north magnetic pole.
</p>
<p>The brushes A and B touch the segments L1 and L3, respectively. When the rotor
</p>
<p>moves, there is relative movement of the collector segments and rotor conductors
</p>
<p>with respect to the stator. Magnetic poles of the stator and brushes are fastened
</p>
<p>to the stator, and they do not move. The effects of the rotor motion in Fig. 11.15
</p>
<p>are manifested as translation of the rotor conductors and collector segments.
</p>

B touch the segments L1 and L3

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Direction of such translation depends on the rotor speed. The rotor motion observed
</p>
<p>from the front side as CW (clockwise) moves the conductors and segments in
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.15 toward right.
</p>
<p>The figure presents the instant when brush A touches segment L1, while brush B
</p>
<p>touches segment L3. Conductors P1�P8 are drawn by thick lines while their internal
connections and connections to the segments are drawn by thin lines. The change in
</p>
<p>the line thickness is used to enhance clarity of the drawing, and it does not imply
</p>
<p>any change in the cross section of relevant conductors and wires. The dotted lines
</p>
<p>indicate connections effectuated at the rear side of the rotor and hence invisible from
</p>
<p>the front.
</p>
<p>Brushes A and B are connected to a source of constant current Ia. In the
</p>
<p>considered position, brush A touches segment L1 which is connected to conductors
</p>
<p>P1 and P4. Starting from brush A, the current splits in two parallel branches. Each of
</p>
<p>these branches carries one half of the source current, Ia/2.
</p>
<p>In the first branch, current Ia/2 passes to rotor conductor P1 and has direction
</p>
<p>from collector (front side) toward rear side of the rotor. At the rear side, conductor
</p>
<p>P1 is connected to conductor P6 by end turn which is marked by the dotted line.
</p>
<p>Direction of current through conductor P6 is toward the reader. Reaching the front
</p>
<p>side, conductor P6 gets connected to segment L2. In the present rotor position, the
</p>
<p>segment L2 is not connected to any of the brushes. Therefore, the current of P6 is
</p>
<p>passed to conductor P3, proceeding in direction from the front to the rear. At the
</p>
<p>rear side of the rotor, conductor P3 is connected to conductor P8 which carries
</p>
<p>current Ia/2 toward the collector and gets connected to the segment L3 and brush B.
</p>
<p>In the second branch, current Ia/2 passes through conductors P4 and P7, gets
</p>
<p>connected with the segment L4, continues through conductors P2 and P5, and ends
</p>
<p>up in the segment L3 and brush B. Hence, the two parallel branches meet at the
</p>
<p>segment L3, adding up into current Ia which passes to brush B and returns to
</p>
<p>the source. Taking into account positions of conductors given in Fig. 11.13, it can
</p>
<p>be concluded that the collector directs source current to rotor conductors in such
</p>
<p>way that all conductors below the north magnetic pole of the stator have electrical
</p>
<p>current Ia/2 directed from the front side (collector) to the rear side of the machine.
</p>
<p>All the conductors below the south pole have the current of the same intensity in the
</p>
<p>opposite direction, from the rear to the front.
</p>
<p>As the rotor turns, conductors P1&ndash;P8 and segments L1&ndash;L4 on unfolded drawing
</p>
<p>in Fig. 11.5 move toward left or right, while the brushes and the stator poles remain
</p>
<p>still. When the rotor moves by p/4 toward left, the brush A gets in touch with
</p>
<p>segment L2, while the brush B gets in touch with segment L4. At this new position
</p>
<p>of the rotor, distribution of currents in rotor conductors is given in Fig. 11.16.
</p>
<p>Conductors P3, P4, P5, and P6 are below the north pole of the stator. Direction of
</p>
<p>current in these conductors is from the reader toward the rear side of the rotor.
</p>
<p>Conductors P7, P8, P1, and P2 are under the south magnetic pole, and they carry
</p>
<p>currents in the opposite direction. By comparing this with the previous case
</p>
<p>(Fig. 11.15), it can be concluded that rotation of the rotor leads to variation of
</p>
<p>electrical currents in individual rotor conductors, but it does not change distribution
</p>
<p>of rotor currents observed from the stator side. In other words, irrespective of the
</p>
<p>276 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>rotor motion, currents in conductors below the north magnetic pole retain direction
</p>
<p>�, while currents in conductors below the south magnetic poles retain direction �.
In this way, rotation of the rotor does not change the course and direction of the
</p>
<p>rotor magnetomotive force and the rotor flux which remain unmoving with respect
</p>
<p>to the stator. Hence, the mechanical commutator insures that the rotor flux vector
</p>
<p>remains still with respect to the stator flux vector.
</p>
<p>Selecting one of rotor conductors and tracking the change in its electrical current as
</p>
<p>the rotor completes one mechanical turn, one comes to conclusion that the conductor
</p>
<p>has alternating current and that one mechanical turn corresponds to one period of the
</p>
<p>current. Hence, mechanical commutator can be envisaged as a device which converts
</p>
<p>DC source current Ia into an alternating current.
</p>
<p>The method of making the rotor winding is shown in Fig. 11.15. It starts by
</p>
<p>connecting the conductor P1 with the segment L1 at the front side of the machine
</p>
<p>and proceeds with putting an end turn at the rear side which connects P1 to P6. It is
</p>
<p>of interest to notice that the connection P1&ndash;P6 at the rear of the machine is realized
</p>
<p>by connecting the end of P1 to the fifth conductor to the right. Further on, the front
</p>
<p>side of the conductor P6 is connected to the segment L2, and this connection
</p>
<p>involves the front end of the conductor P3, the third to the left. The making of
</p>
<p>the winding proceeds in the same manner until all the conductors are connected. All
</p>
<p>the rear side connections are made by jumping to the fifth conductor to the right.
</p>
<p>All the front side connections are made by jumping to the third conductor to the left.
</p>

segment L2
</p>
<p>11.9 Making the Rotor Winding 277</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Besides, all the front side connections between the two conductors involve as well
</p>
<p>connection to one collector segment. It should be noted that the turns made in the
</p>
<p>prescribed way are fractional pitch turns. Full pitch turn would involve jumping to
</p>
<p>the fourth conductor (i.e., slot), whether to left or right.
</p>
<p>Explained is the basic principle of making the rotor winding. In practice, there
</p>
<p>are a number of schemes being used. Most DC machines have more than eight slots.
</p>
<p>The approach can be generalized. With rotor having 2N slots, connections at the
</p>
<p>rear side are made with conductor in (N &thorn; 1)-th slot to the right, while connections
at the collector side are made with conductor in (N � 1)-th slot to the left.
</p>
<p>One slot usually accommodates several conductors. Therefore, the process of
</p>
<p>making the rotor winding and connecting the winding to collector segments is more
</p>
<p>complicated than the one illustrated in Fig. 11.15. Instead of placing only one turn
</p>
<p>in two slots, it is possible to prepare a sectionmade of several turns and placing the
</p>
<p>two sides of this section in two slots. It is also possible to place two groups of
</p>
<p>conductors, each belonging to different sections, into the same slot. In such cases,
</p>
<p>the winding is said to have two layers. The way of connecting the rotor conductors
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 11.15 results in a lap winding. There are also other ways, such as
</p>
<p>wave windings.2
</p>
<p>Figure 11.17 shows the front view of the rotor which is also given in Fig. 11.15
</p>
<p>in its unfolded form. Signs � and � are associated with the rotor conductors. Full
lines marked by arrows show connections of rotor conductors at the front side.
</p>
<p>Dotted lines show the connections between rotor conductors at the rear side of the
</p>
<p>machine. Designation P1P6 next to the dotted line marks that this is connection
</p>
<p>between conductors P1 and P6 made at the rear side of the rotor. A comparison of
</p>
<p>this presentation with the one in Fig. 11.15 illustrates the merits of the unfolded
</p>
<p>scheme.
</p>
<p>11.10 Problems with Commutation
</p>
<p>By considering the example of a rotor winding having 8 conductors and 4 collector
</p>
<p>segments analyzed in the preceding section, it is concluded that at each instant,
</p>
<p>there are two parallel branches between brushes A and B. In each of them, there are
</p>
<p>4 conductors connected in series. Current in the rotor conductors is equal to one half
</p>
<p>of the current taken from the source which is connected to the collector brushes and
</p>
<p>which feeds the rotor winding.
</p>
<p>When brush A passes from segment L1 to segment L2, brush B passes from
</p>
<p>segment L3 to segment L4. Passage of brushes from one segment to another leads to
</p>
<p>changes of direction of electrical currents in individual rotor conductors. In the
</p>
<p>course of commutation, shown in Fig. 11.18, brush A makes a short circuit between

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>segments L1 and L2 while brush B makes a short circuit between segments L3 and
</p>
<p>L4. Owing to the short circuit between the adjacent collector segments, one rotor
</p>
<p>turn made of conductors P1 and P6 is short-circuited by the brush A, while the turn
</p>
<p>P2&ndash;P5 is short-circuited by the brush B.
</p>
<p>At position presented in Fig. 11.15, direction of electrical current in conductors
</p>
<p>P1 and P2 is �, while in conductors P5 and P6 direction of current is �. When the
rotor moves by p/2 and arrives at position presented in Fig. 11.16, direction
</p>
<p>of electrical current in conductors P1 and P2 is changed to �, while direction of
current in conductors P5 and P6 is changed to �. Therefore, during commutation,
direction of current is changed in those parts of the rotor winding which are short-
</p>
<p>circuited by the brushes. In Fig. 11.18, conductors of short-circuited turns are drawn
</p>
<p>by thicker lines.
</p>
<p>In the case where, at the same time, the electromotive force in turn P1&ndash;P6
</p>
<p>assumes significant value, a short circuit current will be established through the
</p>
<p>brush A, limited only by the impedance of the turn. In the same way, electromotive
</p>
<p>force in turn P2&ndash;P5 results in short circuit current through the brush B. The short
</p>
<p>circuit current is determined by the ratio of the electromotive force and the equiva-
</p>
<p>lent impedance of the short-circuited turns. Short circuit currents in the turns that

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>commutate increase the total currents in the brushes and, therefore, increase the
</p>
<p>current density at the contact surface between the brushes and the segments.
</p>
<p>Excessive overheating of the brushes can result in an electric arc between the
</p>
<p>brushes and the segments, as well as between the adjacent segments. Sparking and
</p>
<p>arc can result in accelerated ware of the brushes and eventual damage to the
</p>
<p>collector. If the commutation is inadequate, there is a permanent electric arc between
</p>
<p>the brushes and collector segments. In such case, the collector and brushes overheat.
</p>
<p>Sparking and arc produce considerable quantity of ionized particles in close vicinity
</p>
<p>of brushes. Particles of ionized gas created under the brush A adhere to the collector
</p>
<p>surface. Due to rotation, they get carried away toward the brush B. In cases where the
</p>
<p>commutation is severely impaired, the electric arc may extend between brushes
</p>
<p>A and B. In this state, called circular arcing, the brushes and the rotor power supply
</p>
<p>Ia are in short circuit. At the same time, the rotor winding gets short-circuited.
</p>
<p>Prolonged operation in this mode leads to permanent damage to the winding and to
</p>
<p>mechanical collector and presents a fire risk.
</p>
<p>Inadequate commutation leads to an increase of losses, damages collector and
</p>
<p>brushes, and may result in circular arcing and permanent damage to the machine.
</p>
<p>For this reason, it is significant that the electromotive forces in short-circuited turns
</p>
<p>are kept close to zero during their commutation (contours P1&ndash;P6 and P2&ndash;P5 in
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.18). In the position shown in this figure, relevant conductors are found
</p>
<p>between the stator magnetic poles in the neutral zones denoted by NZ. In the cross
</p>
<p>section of the machine, shown in Fig. 11.17, the neutral zones are in the upper part
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>of the rotor cylinder, at an angle of p/2 with respect to the brushes. The distance
</p>
<p>between the rotor and stator magnetic circuit is very large in the neutral zone. The
</p>
<p>radial component of the magnetic induction faces a very large magnetic resistance.
</p>
<p>At the same time, magnetomotive force of the stator excitation does not contribute
</p>
<p>to radial fields in the neutral zone. For this reason, it can be considered that radial
</p>
<p>component of magnetic induction in neutral zones is very small. With negligible
</p>
<p>magnetic induction, electromotive forces induced in rotor conductors passing
</p>
<p>through neutral zones are of little consequence as well. Therefore, the assumption
</p>
<p>is justified that electromotive forces in rotor turns involved in commutation process
</p>
<p>can be neglected.
</p>
<p>Cross section of the machine is shown in Fig. 11.19, along with the lines of the
</p>
<p>stator magnetic field. The lines come out of the north magnetic pole, pass through
</p>
<p>the rotor magnetic circuit, and enter the south magnetic pole of the stator. It is
</p>
<p>justified to assume that there are some lines of the field passing by the conductors
</p>
<p>which are located in the neutral zone. They extend in tangential direction which is
</p>
<p>collinear with the vector of the peripheral speed. Electrical field induced due to
</p>
<p>motion depends on the vector product of the speed and magnetic induction. As these
</p>
<p>two vectors are collinear, the vector product is equal to zero, as well as induced
</p>
<p>electrical field. In the absence of induced electrical field, electromotive force in
</p>
<p>relevant conductors is equal to zero. Hence, tangential component of the magnetic
</p>
<p>field in the neutral zone does not induce any electromotive force in rotor turns that
</p>
<p>are short-circuited by brushes in the course of commutation.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Conductors P3, P4, P7, and P8 are in the zones of magnetic poles, where
</p>
<p>significant component of the radial magnetic induction is present; thus, the induced
</p>
<p>electromotive forces in these conductors are proportional to the speed of rotation,
</p>
<p>magnetic induction, and length of the conductors. The conductors of the turn P3&ndash;P8
</p>
<p>are not below the same magnetic pole, and the electromotive forces induced in these
</p>
<p>conductors are of opposite directions. Yet, the way of connecting them in series
</p>
<p>(Fig. 11.18) leads to actual adding of their electromotive forces. Neglecting the
</p>
<p>voltage drop on resistances, the voltage which appears across segments L2 and L3
</p>
<p>is double the electromotive force induced in one conductor.
</p>
<p>Commutation without excessive short circuit currents and with no sparks
</p>
<p>requires that DC machine has sufficiently wide neutral zone between the stator
</p>
<p>magnetic poles where the magnetic induction is close to zero. The way of
</p>
<p>connecting the rotor conductors to the commutator segments must ensure that all
</p>
<p>the rotor turns involved by the commutation process and short-circuited by the
</p>
<p>brushes have their conductors in the neutral zone. The short circuit is created by
</p>
<p>the brushes during intervals when they touch two adjacent segments. Therefore,
</p>
<p>angular width of the stator magnetic poles should be less than p in order to allow for
</p>
<p>two neutral zones between the poles. As a consequence, one part of rotor conductors
</p>
<p>will always be in the neutral zone, where the magnetic induction has very low
</p>
<p>value. Increasing the width of neutral zones reduces the problems associated with
</p>
<p>commutation. At the same time, it reduces the number of rotor conductors which
</p>
<p>are encircled by the stator magnetic field and which contribute to the electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical conversion and torque generation.
</p>
<p>Question (11.1): In Fig. 11.18, short-circuited turns P2&ndash;P5 and P1&ndash;P6 contain the
conductors placed at the edges of neutral zones, in the vicinity of magnetic poles.
</p>
<p>Discuss the risk that, due to vicinity of magnetic poles, electromotive forces are
</p>
<p>induced in short-circuited windings.
</p>
<p>Answer (11.1): Figure 11.18 is drawn in the way that conductors P1, P2, P5, and P6
are at the edges of neutral zones, in the vicinity of magnetic poles. It is justified to
</p>
<p>expect that, at this position, the radial component ofmagnetic induction is higher than
</p>
<p>in themiddle of the neutral zone. Conductors P2 and P5make one turn which is short-
</p>
<p>circuited by the brush B (Fig. 11.18). They are laid at the edges of the north magnetic
</p>
<p>pole, symmetrically with respect to the pole. Vicinity of the magnetic pole contri-
</p>
<p>butes to an increased magnetic induction. Because of the symmetry, in positions
</p>
<p>where conductors P2 and P5 are placed, radial component of the magnetic induction
</p>
<p>has the same value. For this reason, the electromotive forces induced in conductors P2
</p>
<p>and P5 are of equal amplitude and direction. Conductors P2 and P5 are series
</p>
<p>connected and make short-circuited turn P2&ndash;P5. Connections of conductors P2 and
</p>
<p>P5 are such that their electromotive forces subtract and cancel. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>electromotive force of the turn P2&ndash;P5 in position shown in Fig. 11.18 is equal to
</p>
<p>zero. This is due to the fact that conductors P2 and P5 are symmetrical with respect
</p>
<p>to the north magnetic pole. In all cases where short-circuited conductors, such as P2
</p>
<p>and P5, come at the very edge of the neutral zone, in close vicinity of the stator
</p>
<p>magnetic poles, it is possible to have considerable electromotive forces induced
</p>
<p>282 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>in such conductors. Yet, their symmetrical placement with respect to the pole ensures
</p>
<p>cancelation of their electromotive forces. The electromotive force in short-circuited
</p>
<p>turn P2&ndash;P5 is equal to zero. The same conclusion can be drawn for conductors P1
</p>
<p>and P6.
</p>
<p>11.11 Rotor Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>Maintaining low intensities of the magnetic induction in neutral zones is hindered
</p>
<p>by the presence of the rotor magnetomotive force. Figure 11.19 shows a simplified
</p>
<p>presentation of the stator field, which propagates horizontally (a), and the rotor
</p>
<p>field, created by the current sheet, which propagates in vertical direction (b). It can
</p>
<p>be concluded that the rotor currents create the rotor flux which has its north and
</p>
<p>south poles in neutral zones, in the area comprising the rotor conductors involved in
</p>
<p>commutation and short-circuited by the brushes. The resultant magnetic field of the
</p>
<p>machine is the sum of the stator and the rotor field. It can be presented in the way
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 11.19c. The stator and rotor fluxes can be represented by the two
</p>
<p>mutually orthogonal vectors designated by FS and FR.
</p>
<p>Rotor of DCmachine is also called armature, owing to the appearance of the rotor
</p>
<p>conductors which are shown in Fig. 11.5b. In the relevant literature, the term induct
</p>
<p>is also used to designate rotor of DC machines. In rotor conductors, electromotive
</p>
<p>forces are induced, proportional to the angular speed of rotation and to the stator flux,
</p>
<p>hence the term induct.Electrical current Ia fed to the brushes is often called armature
</p>
<p>current while the voltage Ua between the brushes A and B is called armature
</p>
<p>voltage. The magnetomotive force and flux created by the rotor currents are called
</p>
<p>reaction of induct or armature reaction. The term reaction is used due to the fact that
</p>
<p>the rotor electromotive force comes as a consequence of the stator flux. At the same
</p>
<p>time, the rotor currents get affected by this electromotive force. Since the rotor
</p>
<p>currents create the rotor flux, such flux is considered to be a reaction to the excitation
</p>
<p>coming from the stator. In a way, the stator flux induces electromotive forces in rotor
</p>
<p>conductors and affects the rotor current. For this reason, the stator is also called
</p>
<p>inductor.
</p>
<p>The rotor flux (i.e., armature flux) is relatively small. The lines of the rotor field
</p>
<p>come out of the rotor magnetic circuit and enter a very large air gap in neutral
</p>
<p>zones. Therefore, the rotor flux passes through regions of very low permeability
</p>
<p>(mo) and very high magnetic resistance. For this reason, the value of magnetic
</p>
<p>induction in neutral zone is relatively small. Nevertheless, even a relatively small
</p>
<p>field in neutral zone may have undesirable influence on commutation. The presence
</p>
<p>of magnetic induction in neutral zone results in induced electromotive forces in
</p>
<p>rotor conductors passing through the neutral zone. These conductors are involved
</p>
<p>in the process of commutation. The turns made of such conductors are connected
</p>
<p>to adjacent collector segments, and they get short-circuited by the brushes. Short-
</p>
<p>circuited loop created in the prescribed way involves the rotor conductors, collector
</p>
<p>segments, and brushes. Induced electromotive forces create short circuit currents
</p>
<p>11.11 Rotor Magnetic Field 283</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>which may cause an electric arc at the contact between brushes and segments.
</p>
<p>For this reason, DC machines make use of additional elements intended to reduce
</p>
<p>magnetic induction in the neutral zones. DC machines may have compensation
</p>
<p>winding and auxiliary poles which are designed and made to suppress the armature
</p>
<p>reaction. They reduce magnetic induction in the neutral zone and ensure that
</p>
<p>commutation takes place with no sparks and no arcing.
</p>
<p>11.12 Current Circuits and Magnetic Circuits
</p>
<p>Structural elements of any electrical machine can be divided into magnetic and
</p>
<p>current circuits, the latter also called windings. In general, it is possible to identify
</p>
<p>four main items:
</p>
<p>&bull; Stator magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>&bull; Rotor magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>&bull; Stator current circuits
</p>
<p>&bull; Rotor current circuits
</p>
<p>Figure 11.20 shows cross section of a DC machine presenting basic elements of
</p>
<p>current circuits and magnetic circuits of DC machines. The figure does not show the
</p>
<p>commutator which is described in the preceding sections. The rotor magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>(A) contains an opening in the center, intended for the shaft, and it has axial slots
</p>
<p>along the perimeter. Parts of the stator magnetic circuit are the main poles (B), yoke
</p>
<p>(C), and auxiliary poles (D). Rotor current circuit (F) includes conductors which are
</p>
<p>laid in slots on the rotor. They are connected in the way described in the preceding
</p>
<p>sections. Stator current circuits comprise the excitation winding (G), compensation
</p>
<p>winding (E), and auxiliary poles winding (H). A more detailed description and
</p>
<p>functions of these elements will be presented further on.

<p>11.13 Magnetic Circuits
</p>
<p>The stator magnetic circuit contains the main poles, auxiliary poles, and yoke.
</p>
<p>The main poles direct the stator flux, also called excitation flux. Starting from the
</p>
<p>north magnetic pole of the stator, the flux passes through the air gap, goes through
</p>
<p>the rotor magnetic circuit, makes another passage through the air gap, enters the
</p>
<p>south magnetic pole of the stator, and then, via yoke, returns to the north pole.
</p>
<p>Within the stator magnetic poles, the flux does not change the course and direction;
</p>
<p>thus, the magnetic induction in the stator iron is constant. For that reason, there are
</p>
<p>no losses in iron. The stator magnetic circuit does not have to be laminated, that is,
</p>
<p>it does not have to be made by stacking iron sheets. Instead, it can be made of solid
</p>
<p>iron. The auxiliary stator poles are used to reduce the magnetic induction in the
</p>
<p>neutral zone, which will be explained later.
</p>
<p>The rotor magnetic circuit is of cylindrical shape. The rotor flux does not move
</p>
<p>with respect to the stator. It remains still with respect to the stator and the stator flux.
</p>
<p>The rotor revolves in magnetic field created by the stator and rotor windings. As a
</p>
<p>consequence, direction of the magnetic field relative to the rotor magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>varies as the rotor turns. Namely, observer that revolves with the rotor experiences
</p>
<p>revolving magnetic field. As the field pulsates with respect to the rotor magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit, there are eddy currents and iron losses in the rotor. The frequency of the
</p>
<p>field pulsations depends on the rotor speed. Variable magnetic field produces both
</p>
<p>hysteresis and eddy current losses in rotor iron. In order to reduce these losses, the
</p>
<p>rotor is built by stacking iron sheets (lamination). The shape of these sheets is given
</p>
<p>in Fig. 11.20. Along the rotor perimeter, there are slots where the rotor conductors
</p>
<p>are placed. At the center of the rotor sheets, there is a round opening intended for
</p>
<p>fastening the shaft. Cylindrical magnetic circuit of the rotor is formed by stacking a
</p>
<p>large number of iron sheets of thickness less than 1 mm.
</p>
<p>11.14 Current Circuits
</p>
<p>Current circuits of the stator include the excitation winding, compensation wind-
ing, and winding of the auxiliary poles. The excitation winding has Nf turns around
</p>
<p>the main poles. Excitation current creates the magnetomotive force of excitation
</p>
<p>Ff &frac14; NfIf. All the quantities and parameters related to the excitation winding have
the subscript f for field. Namely, the excitation winding provides the magnetic field
</p>
<p>of DC machine. Dividing the magnetomotive force by magnetic resistance of the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit, one obtains the stator fluxFf, also called excitation flux. This flux is
</p>
<p>equal to the surface integral of magnetic induction B over cross section of the main
</p>
<p>poles. At the same time, it is equal to the surface integral of the magnetic induction
</p>
<p>over the surface extending in the air gap below the main poles. In Figs. 11.19 and
</p>
<p>11.20, the excitation flux is directed from left to right and passes twice through
</p>
<p>the air gap of width d. By neglecting HFe and the magnetic voltage drop in iron, the
</p>
<p>11.14 Current Circuits 285</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>magnetic induction in the air gap below the main poles can be estimated as
</p>
<p>B &frac14; moNfIf/(2d). Therefore, one can change the excitation flux Ff by varying the
excitation current. In addition to excitation winding, stator has compensation wind-
</p>
<p>ing and winding of auxiliary poles.
</p>
<p>Compensation winding consists of conductors laid in slots made on the inner
side of the main poles of the stator. This winding is connected in such way that its
</p>
<p>conductors carry electrical current Ia/2, the same current that is carried by rotor
</p>
<p>conductors. Direction of the current in conductors pertaining to compensation
</p>
<p>winding is opposite to direction of rotor currents. Since conductors of the rotor
</p>
<p>winding and those of the compensation windings are in close vicinity, their magne-
</p>
<p>tomotive forces mutually cancel due to opposite directions of their electrical
</p>
<p>currents. Therefore, current in the compensation winding compensates and cancels
</p>
<p>the magnetomotive force of the rotor. This is done in order to reduce the magnetic
</p>
<p>induction in the neutral zone and to avoid short circuit currents in rotor turns
</p>
<p>involved in the process of commutation. The compensation winding cancels the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force of all the rotor conductors located under the main stator poles.
</p>
<p>This does not include all the rotor conductors, as some of them are found in neutral
</p>
<p>zones, away from the main poles. The magnetomotive force of these conductors is
</p>
<p>not fully compensated by action of the compensation winding. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>auxiliary poles are also built and placed against neutral zones with the purpose to
</p>
<p>restrain the magnetic induction in these zones. Auxiliary poles have corresponding
</p>
<p>winding.
</p>
<p>Winding of auxiliary poles has turns around the auxiliary poles magnetic core,
denoted by (D) in Fig. 11.20. The air gap below the auxiliary poles is considerably
</p>
<p>wider compared to the air gap below main magnetic poles. This is done to increase
</p>
<p>the magnetic resistance encountered by the armature reaction. Current in the
</p>
<p>winding of the auxiliary poles is made proportional to the rotor current. Direction
</p>
<p>of this current and the number of turns are adjusted to achieve compensation of the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force of the rotor which has not been compensated by action of
</p>
<p>the compensation winding. By joint action of the compensation winding and
</p>
<p>auxiliary poles, it is possible to control and suppress the magnetic induction in
</p>
<p>neutral zones, that is, below auxiliary poles. Essentially, the magnetic induction
</p>
<p>in the neutral zones should be reduced to a value close to zero. Detailed analysis of
</p>
<p>the process of commutation is not included in this book. Further study shows that
</p>
<p>the stress and ware of the brushes and collector segments is reduced in cases with
</p>
<p>linear commutation, where the current in short-circuited turns involved in commu-
</p>
<p>tation process varies from &thorn;Ia/2 to �Ia/2 in linear fashion. Prerequisite for linear
commutation is establishing magnetic induction in neutral zones which has a very
</p>
<p>small value that varies in proportion to armature current Ia. Detailed analysis of the
</p>
<p>process of commutation and method of designing the compensation winding and
</p>
<p>the winding of auxiliary poles are beyond the scope of this book.
</p>
<p>Rotor winding is formed by connecting rotor conductors which are placed in
corresponding slots to the collector segments in the manner prescribed earlier. With
</p>
<p>NR rotor conductors connected to segments, there are two parallel branches between
</p>
<p>brushes A and B at each instant, each branch having NR/2 conductors. As stated
</p>
<p>286 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>before, the rotor winding is also called armature winding, while current Ia, fed to
</p>
<p>the brushes from an external source, is also called armature current. The terms
</p>
<p>inductor (for the stator) and induct (for the rotor) are also in use, since the
</p>
<p>electromotive force in the rotor is induced due to the stator flux. Thus, excitation
</p>
<p>current If is also called inductor current, while armature current Ia is called induct
</p>
<p>current. The magnetomotive force of the rotor and the rotor flux can be represented
</p>
<p>by the vectors of vertical direction (Fig. 11.19d) and are called the magnetomotive
</p>
<p>force of induct, flux of induct but also reaction of induct or armature reaction. Term
</p>
<p>armature reaction can be explained by taking example of a DC machine operating
</p>
<p>as a generator. If the brushes A and B of the generator are connected to a resistive
</p>
<p>load, the armature current and current in the rotor conductors are obtained by
</p>
<p>dividing the rotor electromotive force by the equivalent resistance of the electrical
</p>
<p>circuit. Hence, the armature current is proportional to the induced electromotive
</p>
<p>force. The electromotive force is proportional to the rotor speed and to the inductor
</p>
<p>(stator) flux. As a consequence, the rotor currents, magnetomotive force, and flux
</p>
<p>are all proportional to the stator excitation. Therefore, the rotor current and flux are
</p>
<p>apparent reaction to the stator excitation, which brings up the term armature
</p>
<p>reaction.
</p>
<p>Question (11.2): Determine the excitation fluxFf of a DC machine. The excitation
current is If, the number of turns in the excitation winding is Nf, the axial length of
</p>
<p>the machine is L, the rotor radius is R, the main north pole of the machine is seen
</p>
<p>from the center of the rotor at an angle a, while the air gap under the main poles is d.
</p>
<p>Answer (11.2.): The excitation current creates magnetomotive force Ff &frac14; NfIf.
The excitation flux passes through the yoke and main poles, through rotor magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit, and it passes twice through the air gap under the main poles. Since magnetic
</p>
<p>field HFe in iron is negligible due to a very high permeability of iron, it is justified to
</p>
<p>assume that significant values of magnetic field H exist only in the air gap. There-
</p>
<p>fore, radial component of magnetic field in the air gap is H &frac14; Nf If /(2d). Radial
component of the magnetic induction in the air gap is B &frac14; moNfIf /(2d). Under
circumstances, magnetic induction under the main poles has a constant value.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the excitation flux is obtained multiplying the magnetic induction by
</p>
<p>the surface of the main poles. The surface of each main magnetic pole is S &frac14; aR�L.
Eventually, Ff &frac14; aR�L�moNfIf/(2d).
</p>
<p>Question (11.3): For the machine described in the previous question, it is known
that the rotor conductors carry electrical current Ia/2. There are 10 rotor conductors
</p>
<p>under the north pole of the stator and 10 conductors under the south pole of the
</p>
<p>stator. Calculate the electromagnetic torque of the machine.
</p>
<p>Answer (11.3): The vector of magnetic induction is of radial direction; it is
orthogonal to the conductor. The electromagnetic force acting on the straight
</p>
<p>conductor depends on the vector product of the magnetic induction B and the
</p>
<p>conductor length l. Thus, the force acts in tangential direction. Relevant vectors
</p>
<p>are perpendicular, and the force F &frac14; LBIa/2 acts on each of conductors. Contribu-
tion of each conductor to the total electromagnetic torque is T1 &frac14; RF &frac14; R LBIa/2.
</p>
<p>11.14 Current Circuits 287</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The electromagnetic force acts only upon the conductors below the main poles.
</p>
<p>Namely, there is no force on conductors in the neutral zone where magnetic
</p>
<p>induction has negligible values. Therefore, the electromagnetic torque is T &frac14; 20
T1 &frac14; 20�R�L�B�Ia/2.
Question (11.4): The machine described in the preceding questions rotates at a
constant speed of Om. Assume that the brushes are disconnected from the power
</p>
<p>supply and that the voltage between the brushes is measured by a voltmeter. If the
</p>
<p>rotor winding is made to have two parallel branches between the brushes, determine
</p>
<p>the voltmeter reading.
</p>
<p>Answer (11.4): The electromotive force is E1 &frac14; L�v�B, where v &frac14; R�Om is the
peripheral rotor speed. It is induced in conductors which are under the main stator
</p>
<p>poles. In neutral zones, magnetic induction is negligible, and the electromotive force
</p>
<p>induced in rotor conductors passing through neutral zones is very small and should
</p>
<p>not be taken into account. The rotor conductors are connected in series, and their
</p>
<p>electromotive forces add up. In Fig. 11.15, it is shown that all the conductors are split
</p>
<p>into two parallel branches. Series connection of conductors P1, P6, P3, and P8 has
</p>
<p>its ends connected to the brushes. At the same time, series connection of conductors
</p>
<p>P4, P7, P2, and P5 is connected between the brushes as well. Both branches with
</p>
<p>series-connected conductors are made in such way that the electromotive forces
</p>
<p>of individual conductors are added. The question concerns the machine having 10
</p>
<p>conductors under each of the stator magnetic poles. Therefore, the total number of
</p>
<p>conductors having electromotive force E1 is equal to 20. Since the conductors are
</p>
<p>split in two parallel branches, the electromotive force Ea is equal 10 E1, namely,
</p>
<p>10 L�R�Om�B.
</p>
<p>11.15 Direct and Quadrature Axis
</p>
<p>Stator flux is also called excitation flux, or flux of the inductor. Magnetic axis that
</p>
<p>corresponds to the excitation flux is called direct axis. Within previous figures, the
</p>
<p>direct axis is set horizontally. As a rule, direct axis is determined by the position of
</p>
<p>the main stator poles. In Figs. 11.19 and 11.20, the armature reaction is directed
</p>
<p>along vertical axis. The rotor current sheet has electrical currents in the left-hand
</p>
<p>side of the cross section, directed away from the reader. In the right-hand side of the
</p>
<p>cross section, the currents are of the opposite direction, toward the reader. For this
</p>
<p>reason, the rotor magnetomotive force and flux, also called the armature reaction,
</p>
<p>can be represented by vectors in vertical direction. The axis of the armature reaction
</p>
<p>is called quadrature axis.
</p>
<p>The stator auxiliary poles act along the quadrature axis, compensating the effects
</p>
<p>of the armature reaction. The same is the role of the compensation winding, whose
</p>
<p>conductors create a magnetomotive force along the lateral axis in the opposite
</p>
<p>direction of the reaction of induct. The purpose of the auxiliary poles and compen-
</p>
<p>sation winding is reducing the magnetic induction in the neutral zone, along the
</p>
<p>288 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>quadrature axis. The compensation winding cancels the magnetomotive force of the
</p>
<p>rotor conductors passing under the main poles, while the auxiliary poles are built in
</p>
<p>neutral zones where they affect the magnetic induction and electromotive force
</p>
<p>induced in the turns involved in the process of commutation. By joint action of the
</p>
<p>compensation winding and auxiliary poles, the neutral zone has very low values of
</p>
<p>the resultant magnetic induction. The flux vectors representing the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>windings are shown in Fig. 11.21. Quadrature axis flux of the rotor is compensated
</p>
<p>by the quadrature axis flux of the stator.
</p>
<p>11.15.1 Vector Representation
</p>
<p>The rotor flux of a DC machine is also called armature reaction and it is represented
</p>
<p>by the flux vector FR in Fig. 11.21. Along the quadrature axis there are vectors FAP
and FCW, which represent fluxes of auxiliary poles and compensation winding.
</p>
<p>Direct axis of the machine is set horizontally, while quadrature axis is vertical.
</p>
<p>Directions of fluxes FAP andFCW are opposite to direction of the rotor fluxFR. This
</p>
<p>is due to the need to reduce the magnetic induction in neutral zones, accomplishing
</p>
<p>in this way an efficient commutation. In other words, it is necessary to reduce the
</p>
<p>resultant flux along the quadrature axis. Ideally, the compensation winding and
</p>
<p>auxiliary poles completely eliminate the armature reactionFR, making the resultant
</p>
<p>flux along the quadrature axis equal to zero. As already stated, the compensation
</p>
<p>winding has conductors laid in the immediate vicinity of the rotor conductors, and
</p>
<p>they carry electrical currents of the same intensities but of opposite directions. The
</p>
<p>conductors are separated by a relatively small air gap; thus, the compensation
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.21 Vector representation of the stator and rotor fluxes. (a) Position of the flux vectors of
individual windings. (b) Resultant fluxes of the stator and rotor. (c) Resultant flux of the machine
</p>
<p>11.15 Direct and Quadrature Axis 289</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>winding efficiently cancels the magnetomotive force created by rotor conductors
</p>
<p>that are passing below the main poles. All the remaining rotor conductors are in
</p>
<p>neutral zones, between the main poles, out of the reach of the main poles, passing
</p>
<p>against the auxiliary poles. The action of the auxiliary poles is intended for further
</p>
<p>reduction of the magnetic field in neutral zones.
</p>
<p>11.15.2 Resultant Fluxes
</p>
<p>Figure 11.21a shows vectors representing the fluxes of individual stator and rotor
</p>
<p>windings. Part (b) of the figure shows the resultant flux vectors. The rotor has only
</p>
<p>one winding, the armature winding. Therefore, the resultant rotor flux is equal to
</p>
<p>the armature reaction FR. The stator has three windings, the excitation winding, the
</p>
<p>compensation winding, and the winding on auxiliary poles. The resultant stator flux
</p>
<p>FS is equal to the sum of the three fluxes: the excitation flux, the flux of compensa-
</p>
<p>tion winding, and the flux of auxiliary poles.
</p>
<p>11.15.3 Resultant Flux of the Machine
</p>
<p>Resultant flux of the machine is equal to the vector sum of the fluxes in all the
</p>
<p>windings of the machine. Therefore, the resultant flux vector of the machine is
</p>
<p>equal to the sum of the resultant stator flux FS and the rotor flux FR. In cases where
</p>
<p>fluxes FAP and FCW compensate the armature reaction in full, the resultant flux
</p>
<p>along the quadrature axis is equal to zero, while the resultant flux along the direct
</p>
<p>axis is equal the excitation flux Ff, as shown in Fig. 11.21c.
</p>
<p>Question (11.5): Figure 11.21 shows the case when the compensation winding and
auxiliary poles eliminate the rotor flux FR in full. By adding these two fluxes, one
</p>
<p>obtains the stator flux along the quadrature axis FAP + FCW which has the same
</p>
<p>amplitude as the rotor flux FR, but it has the opposite direction. For this reason,
</p>
<p>the total flux of the machine along the quadrature axis is equal to zero. From
</p>
<p>previous chapters, it is known that the electromagnetic torque of the machine is
</p>
<p>determined by the vector product of the stator and rotor fluxes. Does the fact that
</p>
<p>equivalent quadrature flux of the machine equals zero leads to conclusion that the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque of the machine is equal to zero as well?
</p>
<p>Answer (11.5): It is necessary to note that the electromagnetic torque depends on
the vector product of vectors FR and FS. Vector FR represents the flux created by
</p>
<p>all the rotor windings, while vector FS represents the flux created by all the stator
</p>
<p>windings. In the case of a DC machine, the rotor has only one winding, the
</p>
<p>armature winding, and the flux FR is equal to the armature reaction flux. The
</p>
<p>stator has three windings. Therefore, the vector FS represents the sum of the fluxes
</p>
<p>in these three stator windings, namely, the excitation winding, the compensation
</p>
<p>290 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>winding, and the winding of auxiliary poles. Electrical currents in conductors of
</p>
<p>the compensation winding and the winding of auxiliary poles create a quadrature
</p>
<p>component of the stator flux. In the considered case, the compensation winding and
</p>
<p>the winding of auxiliary poles create the flux along the quadrature axis which is of
</p>
<p>the same amplitude as the rotor flux but of the opposite direction. The sum of the
</p>
<p>fluxes created by the compensation winding and the auxiliary poles is �FR.
Therefore, the resultant flux of the machine in quadrature axis is equal to zero.
</p>
<p>It is necessary to notice that the resultant flux of the machine comes as the sum of
</p>
<p>the fluxes of all the machine windings, residing on both stator and rotor. Although
</p>
<p>the resultant flux along the quadrature axis is zero, there still exists the rotor flux
</p>
<p>along the quadrature axis. For that reason, there still exists the possibility for the
</p>
<p>machine to generate the electromagnetic torque. The torque is determined by
</p>
<p>the vector product of the stator and rotor flux vectors. It depends on flux vectors
</p>
<p>FR and FS, shown in Fig. 11.21b. The angle between these two flux vectors is not
</p>
<p>equal to p/2, but the sine of this angle has a non zero value. The torque is
</p>
<p>determined by the product of amplitudes FR and FS and the sine of the angle
</p>
<p>between them. Therefore, the torque assumes a nonzero value in the case under
</p>
<p>consideration. The torque can be calculated as the product of the direct component
</p>
<p>of the stator flux Ff and quadrature component of the rotor flux FR, both different
</p>
<p>than zero in the considered case. Therefore, despite the fact that the resultant
</p>
<p>quadrature flux of the machine is equal to zero, the electromagnetic torque of the
</p>
<p>machine is different from zero.
</p>
<p>11.16 Electromotive Force and Electromagnetic Torque
</p>
<p>Further study of DC machines requires the expressions for calculating the
</p>
<p>electromotive force and electromagnetic torque from the machine flux, current,
</p>
<p>and speed. For purposes of modeling, deriving the steady-state equivalent schemes,
</p>
<p>and constructing mechanical characteristics, it is necessary to derive the torque
</p>
<p>expression and the electromotive force expression for DC machines. The electro-
</p>
<p>motive force Ea in armature winding is also called the rotor electromotive force and
</p>
<p>denoted by Ea, and it can be measured between the brushes A and B in conditions
</p>
<p>where the armature current Ia is equal to zero (no load condition). The electromag-
</p>
<p>netic torque and electromotive force should be expressed in terms of the armature
</p>
<p>current, excitation flux, angular speed of the rotor, and the machine parameters.
</p>
<p>11.16.1 Electromotive Force in Armature Winding
</p>
<p>In each of the rotor conductors passing under the main poles of the stator, there is an
</p>
<p>induced electromotive force E1 &frac14; R�Om�B�L, where Om is angular speed of the
rotor, R is the rotor radius, L is length of the rotor cylinder, while B is the radial
</p>

<p>component of the magnetic induction under the main poles. In conductors passing
</p>
<p>through the neutral zone, there are no electromotive forces because magnetic
</p>
<p>induction in neutral zones is negligible.
</p>
<p>Conductors passing under the north magnetic pole have an electromotive force of
</p>
<p>the opposite sign with respect to conductors passing under the south magnetic pole.
</p>
<p>Therefore, as the rotor revolves, each conductor slides under opposite magnetic
</p>
<p>poles and has an electromotive force that changes its sign periodically, in synchro-
</p>
<p>nism with rotor mechanical turns. The frequency of the sign changes is determined
</p>
<p>by the rotor speed. An example of the change in electromotive force induced in a
</p>
<p>single conductor is given in Fig. 11.12b. The change of this electromotive force
</p>
<p>resembles a train of pulses. The pulse amplitude is E1 while the sign changes in
</p>
<p>synchronism with the rotor motion. The sign changes as the considered conductor
</p>
<p>leaves the region under the north magnetic pole of the stator and enters the region
</p>
<p>under the south pole. It is shown hereafter that connections of rotor conductors and
</p>
<p>collector segments results in adding individual electromotive forces and provides a
</p>
<p>DC voltage between the brushes A and B. In the prescribed way, the mechanical
</p>
<p>commutator converts the AC electromotive forces of individual conductors into DC
</p>
<p>voltage available between the brushes.
</p>
<p>Rotor conductors are divided in two parallel branches, and each of the branches
</p>
<p>is connected between the brushes. As the rotor revolves, individual conductors slide
</p>
<p>under the stator magnetic poles. At the same time, they pass from one of the
</p>
<p>branches to another. Namely, conductors do not appertain to any of the parallel
</p>
<p>branches for more than one half of the rotor mechanical turn. During the next half
</p>
<p>turn, the same conductor belongs to the other parallel branch. This occurs due to
</p>
<p>mechanical commutator and the process of commutation. Figure 11.23a shows
</p>
<p>wiring diagram of rotor conductors in rotor position given in Fig. 11.22, where
</p>

<p>the brush A touches the segment L1. The two parallel branches are connected
</p>
<p>between the brushes A and B. These branches are P1-P6-P3-P8 and P4-P7-P2-P5.
</p>
<p>The electromotive force induced in conductors belonging to each of these branches
</p>
<p>is added to produce Ea, the electromotive force of the armature (rotor) winding.
</p>
<p>This electromotive force is equal to voltageUa, measured between the brushes in no
</p>
<p>load condition, when the armature current is Ia &frac14; 0. In the position shown in
Figs. 11.22 and 11.23, the electromotive forces in conductors P1, P2, P3, and P4
</p>
<p>are of the same direction. These conductors pass under the north magnetic pole.
</p>
<p>Conductors P5, P6, P7, and P8 are passing under the south magnetic pole. In these
</p>
<p>conductors, the electromotive force has direction which is opposite with respect to
</p>
<p>the one induced in P1, P2, P3, and P4. When considering one of parallel branches,
</p>
<p>such as P1-P6-P3-P8, and taking into account the way of making their series
</p>
<p>connection in Figs. 11.22 and 11.23, it is concluded that electromotive forces of
</p>
<p>the four conductors are added, resulting in Ea &frac14; 4E1.
It is of interest to show that Ea is a DC quantity and that the rotor motion does not
</p>
<p>lead to variation of Ea sign. When the rotor turns by p/4 with respect to position in
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.22, the brushes A and B get in touch with segments L2 and L4, as shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 11.16. In this new position, conductors P3, P4, P5, and P6 pass below the
</p>
<p>north magnetic pole and therefore have their induced electromotive forces of
</p>
<p>the same direction. Conductors P7, P8, P1, and P2 pass below the south magnetic
</p>
<p>pole. Their electromotive forces have the opposite direction with respect to conduc-
</p>
<p>tors passing under the north pole. At the same time, distribution of conductors
</p>
<p>between the two parallel branches changes. According to Fig. 11.16, conductors P3,
</p>
<p>P8, P5, and P2 make one parallel branch, while conductors P6, P1, P4, and P7 make
</p>
<p>the other parallel branch. The figure shows that the conductors are connected in
</p>
<p>the way that their electromotive forces are actually added; thus, the electromotive
</p>
<p>force Ea remains equal to 4E1, with brush A being at the higher potential than brush
</p>
<p>B. In other words, a DC voltage exists between the brushes A and B, notwithstand-
</p>
<p>ing the rotor motion. This shows that the mechanical commutator has the role of a
</p>
<p>rectifier which converts the alternating electromotive forces into DC electromotive
</p>
<p>force Ea. This electromotive force is called rotor or armature electromotive force.

<p>If the brushes A and B are connected to an external resistor or other consumer of
</p>
<p>electrical energy which operates with DC currents, the machine shown in Fig. 11.23
</p>
<p>will run as a generator, supplying electrical energy to the consumer. It will be shown
</p>
<p>later that in such case, it is required to drive the rotor by an external torque obtained
</p>
<p>from a hydro turbine, steam turbine, or internal combustion motor. The armature
</p>
<p>winding then represents a voltage generator whose terminals are available at brushes
</p>
<p>A and B and which produces a DC voltage Ua. The equivalent voltage generator
</p>
<p>is shown in Fig. 11.23b. Under no load conditions, voltage between the brushes is
</p>
<p>equal to the electromotive force Ea &frac14; 4E1 &frac14; 4ROmBL. Internal resistance of the
equivalent voltage generator Ra includes resistance of the brushes A and B, resis-
</p>
<p>tance of rotor conductors connected in two parallel branches, and a relatively small
</p>
<p>resistance of collector segments. It can be determined by measuring resistance
</p>
<p>between the brushes in conditions where the rotor speed is equal to zero (Om &frac14; 0).
The electromotive force is then equal to zero, and the equivalent voltage source is
</p>
<p>reduced to internal resistance Ra. The value of Ra can be calculated for DC machine
</p>
<p>with eight rotor conductors, divided in two parallel branches with four conductor
</p>
<p>each, as shown in Fig. 11.23. If resistance of one rotor conductor is R1 while
</p>
<p>the equivalent resistance of the brushes and collector is DR, then the internal
</p>
<p>resistance of the equivalent source is Ra &frac14; 2R1 &thorn;DR. Previous considerations
show that the armature winding of DC machine can be represented by a voltage
</p>
<p>generator having no load electromotive force Ea and internal resistance Ra.
</p>
<p>11.16.2 Torque Generation
</p>
<p>It is required to determine relation between the electromagnetic torque, excitation
</p>
<p>flux, and armature current. The excitation flux from the main poles passes to the
</p>
<p>rotor magnetic circuit via air gap, where the magnetic induction is of radial
</p>
<p>direction. The surface separating internal side of the main pole from the air gap is
</p>
<p>of the form of a bent rectangle which represents a sector of the cylinder. The surface
</p>
<p>of this sector is S &frac14; WL, where L is length of the machine while W &frac14; aR is
the width of the main pole, measured along its internal side which faces the air
</p>
<p>gap. The width W is one section of the circle having the radius R. To an observer
</p>
<p>positioned at the rotor center, the surface S is seen at the angle a. Magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B in the air gap below the main poles is equal to the ratio of flux Ff and
</p>
<p>surface S. The current in rotor conductors is Ia/2, where Ia is the armature current,
</p>
<p>fed to the brushes from an external source. Figure 11.24a gives an unfolded scheme
</p>
<p>of the rotor winding and shows forces acting upon its conductors. Part (b) of this
</p>
<p>figure shows directions of electrical currents in rotor conductors, seen from the
</p>
<p>collector side. At the given position of the rotor, conductors P1, P2, P3, and P4
</p>
<p>are below the north pole and carry currents of direction �. Lines of the field of
magnetic induction come out of the main pole, denoted by N; they pass through the
</p>
<p>air gap, come across the rotor conductors, and enter the rotor magnetic circuit.
</p>
<p>In the considered zone below the north pole, the vector product of radial component
</p>
<p>294 11 Introduction to DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>of magnetic induction and coaxially directed current (�) gives tangential force,
denoted by F1. Below the south pole, direction of the current in conductors changes.
</p>
<p>At the same time, direction of the magnetic induction changes as well. It comes out
</p>
<p>of the rotor magnetic circuit, passes through the air gap, and enters the stator
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit (S). Change in directions of both the current and magnetic induc-
</p>
<p>tion results in tangential force F1 which retains its original direction and acts in
</p>
<p>counterclockwise direction.
</p>
<p>Individual forces contribute to electromagnetic torque. The arm of each force is
</p>
<p>equal to R. The torque contribution of each individual conductor is T1 &frac14; RF1 &frac14;
RL(Ia/2)B. Since the total number of conductors is 8, the electromagnetic torque is
</p>
<p>equal to Tem &frac14; 8RL(Ia/2)B &frac14; 2DLIaFf/S, where D, L, Ia,Ff, and S denote the rotor
diameter, axial length of the machine, armature current, excitation flux, and cross-
</p>
<p>section area of the main poles, respectively.
</p>
<p>11.16.3 Torque and Electromotive Force Expressions
</p>
<p>In this section, induced electromotive force of the armature winding Ea is expressed
</p>
<p>in terms of the rotor speed and the excitation flux. Further on, the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque Tem is expressed in terms of the excitation flux and the armature current.
</p>
<p>To begin with, it is necessary to establish relation between the magnetic induction
</p>
<p>in the air gap, excitation current, and the excitation flux.
</p>
<p>Figure 11.25 provides the form and dimensions of the main poles. The
</p>
<p>electromotive force and forces upon conductors depend on position where the
</p>
<p>conductors are located. Rotor conductors are positioned at the external surface of
</p>
<p>the rotor magnetic circuit; thus, it is necessary to determine magnetic induction in
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.24 (a) Forces acting upon conductors represented in an unfolded scheme. (b) Forces

<p>the air gap. The width d of the air gap is much smaller than the radius R of the rotor.
</p>
<p>Boundary conditions for magnetic field can be applied to the surface separating the
</p>
<p>air gap from the ferromagnetic material. According to boundary conditions, mag-
</p>
<p>netic induction on the air gap side of the surface is oriented in radial direction.
</p>
<p>As already shown, the cross-section S of themain poles isWL. VariableW &frac14; aD/2 is
the width of the main poles, while a is the angle covered by the main pole to an
</p>
<p>observer positioned at the rotor center. The excitation flux passes through the stator
</p>
<p>and rotor magnetic circuits where the magnetic field HFe is very small. The flux
</p>
<p>passes twice through the air gap; thus,

<p>The rotor comprises a total of NR conductors, but some of them are not under
</p>
<p>the main poles, and they pass through the neutral zone between the main poles. The
</p>
<p>remaining rotor conductors are in the zone of the main poles, within the reach of the
</p>
<p>magnetic induction Bf. In the neutral zone, the conductors are not subject to any
</p>
<p>force and no electromotive force is induced in them. The rotor conductors are
</p>
<p>evenly distributed along the machine perimeter. Below the north pole of the width
</p>
<p>W, there are NRW/(pD) rotor conductors. The same number of conductors is found
</p>
<p>below the south magnetic pole.
</p>

<p>radius of the rotor. Rotor conductors are connected in series in the way that the
</p>
<p>induced electromotive forces are added. Total number of conductors containing
</p>
<p>induced electromotive force is equal to the sum of conductors below the north and
</p>
<p>south poles, 2NRW/(pD). Since all rotor conductors are connected in two parallel

<p>Chapter 12
</p>
<p>Modeling and Supplying DC Machines
</p>
<p>In this chapter, mathematical model is developed for DCmachines with excitation
</p>
<p>windings and DC machines with permanent magnet excitation. The block dia-
</p>
<p>gram of the model is used to provide a brief introduction to the torque control.
</p>
<p>Steady-state equivalent circuits are derived and explained for armature and
</p>
<p>excitation windings. These circuits are used to introduce and analyze mechanical
</p>
<p>characteristic of separately excited DC machine and determine the steady-state
</p>
<p>speed. The chapter provides basic elements for the control of the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>Steady-state operation of DC generators is explained along with basic output
</p>
<p>characteristics. Typical applications of DC machines are classified on the basis of
</p>
<p>the speed and torque changes within the four quadrants of Tem&ndash;Om plane. On that
</p>
<p>ground, the basic requirements are specified for the power supply of the armature
</p>
<p>windings. The operation of switching power converter with H-bridge is briefly
</p>
<p>explained, along with the basic notions on pulse-width modulation (PWM). The
</p>
<p>impact of pulsed power supply on the machine operation is considered by study-
</p>
<p>ing the ripple of the armature current. The chapter closes with an overview of most
</p>
<p>common power converter topologies used in supplying DC machines.
</p>
<p>Analysis of electrical and mechanical characteristics of a DC machine is based
</p>
<p>on mathematical model. The model contains differential equations and algebraic
</p>
<p>relations describing transient processes in the machine. In DC electrical machines,
</p>
<p>the excitation flux is established along direct axis, while the rotor flux (armature
</p>
<p>reaction) appears along quadrature axis. The two axes are orthogonal, and the
</p>
<p>mutual inductance between the excitation winding and the armature windings is

<p>equal to zero.1 Namely, changes in excitation current do not have an immediate
</p>
<p>impact on the rotor flux. At the same time, changes of the rotor current do not affect
</p>
<p>the excitation flux. The absence of interaction between direct and quadrature axes
</p>
<p>makes the transient phenomena of these axes decoupled. Transients in armature
</p>
<p>winding do not affect2 the excitation winding. Hence, differential equation describ-
</p>
<p>ing the changes of the excitation flux and current does not have factors proportional
</p>
<p>to the rotor flux and the armature current. For this reason, mathematical model of
</p>
<p>DC machine is relatively simple and clear. The flux control loop is decoupled from
</p>
<p>the torque control loop, and their design and application are quite straightforward.
</p>
<p>The subject of modeling is a DC machine connected to the source ua, feeding the
</p>
<p>armature winding, and to the source uf, feeding the excitation winding. Connections
</p>
<p>of DC machine to electrical sources and mechanical load are shown in Fig. 12.1.
</p>
<p>Notations ua and uf are used in the figure since the winding voltages can be variable
</p>
<p>and change in time. In steady state, when the supply voltages are constant, these
</p>
<p>quantities are denoted by Ua and Uf. The shaft of the machine rotates at the angular
</p>
<p>speed of Om. Revolving masses of inertia J are accelerated or decelerated by
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque Tem and load torque Tm. Reference directions of the two
</p>
<p>torques are opposite, and they are shown in the figure.
</p>
<p>The analysis of transient phenomena in a DC machine presented here results in
</p>
<p>differential equations that make up the mathematical model. According to

<p>conclusions of the preceding section, the mathematical model includes:

<p>axes changes the operating point (B,H) on nonlinear magnetizing curve of ferromagnetic material,
</p>
<p>which affects magnetic resistance and flux in the other axis. Namely, the lines of the excitation flux

<p>Nonlinearity of magnetic circuit leads to coupling of the orthogonal axes in all cases where their

<p>saturation level is altered by the armature current, there is a change in magnetic resistance on

<p>the path of the excitation flux. Through this secondary effect, called cross saturation, the armature

<p>12.1 Voltage Balance Equation for Excitation Winding
</p>
<p>The magnetomotive force along quadrature axis is created by the rotor conductors,
</p>
<p>and it has no influence on the excitation flux. Therefore, instantaneous value of the
</p>
<p>flux cf in the excitation winding is cf &frac14; NfFf &frac14; Lfif. In further considerations,
instantaneous values of currents, flux linkages, and voltages are dealt with. There-
</p>
<p>fore, notation if is used, denoting the variables that change in time, such as the
</p>
<p>excitation current if(t). For brevity, further expressions are written by using repre-
</p>
<p>sentation such as if, without an explicit specification such as if(t), showing that
</p>
<p>the considered variable is a time-varying function.
</p>
<p>Coefficient of self-induction of the excitation winding is given by (11.6). The
</p>
<p>excitation winding has a finite electrical resistance Rf, and the voltage balance in
</p>
<p>this winding is expressed by the equation

<p>12.2 Voltage Balance Equation in Armature Winding
</p>
<p>Rotor winding has two parallel branches connected between the brushes A and B.
</p>
<p>The equivalent internal resistance of armature winding Ra &frac14; NRR1/4 + DR can be
measured between the brushes at standstill. The number of rotor conductors is NR,
</p>
<p>while R1 is resistance of a single conductor. The equivalent resistance of the
</p>
<p>commutator, including the brushes and collector, is denoted by DR. In addition to
</p>
<p>resistance, rotor (armature) winding has self-inductance La. Namely, the presence
</p>
<p>of electrical currents in rotor conductors creates magnetomotive force called
</p>
<p>armature reaction. Consequently, the rotor flux is created, inversely proportional
</p>
<p>to the magnetic resistance Rm. The magnetic resistance along the path of the rotor
</p>
<p>flux is relatively high, since the rotor flux passes through the neutral zone between
</p>
<p>the main poles, where the lines of magnetic field face a very large air gap.
</p>
<p>Inductance of the armature winding La is proportional to the square of the number
</p>
<p>of turns and inversely proportional to the magnetic resistance of the magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit containing the rotor flux. This magnetic resistance is significantly higher
</p>
<p>than the one encountered by the excitation flux. This is due to the fact that the
</p>
<p>excitation flux passes through a very small air gap d, while the armature reaction
</p>
<p>faces a very large air gap under the auxiliary poles. Smaller DC machines are
</p>
<p>made with no auxiliary poles at all, and they have even larger magnetic resistance
</p>
<p>in quadrature axis. In most DC machines, the number of turns in excitation
</p>
<p>winding is much larger than the number of turns in armature winding. As a
</p>
<p>consequence, armature inductance La is two or three orders of magnitude smaller
</p>
<p>compared to the inductance Lf of the excitation winding. In every coil, electrical
</p>
<p>current changes at the rate di/dt ~ u/L, proportional to the applied voltage and
</p>
<p>inversely proportional to the coil inductance. Therefore, the armature current in
</p>
<p>DC machines changes at a rate which is two or three orders of magnitude higher
</p>
<p>than the rate of change of the excitation current.
</p>
<p>Question (12.2): Determine the equivalent internal resistance Ra of armature
winding having a total of NR &frac14; 40 conductors. Resistance of each conductor is
0.1 O, while the equivalent resistance of the mechanical commutator with two

<p>brushes is equal to DR &frac14; 0.2 O. Determine the self-inductance of the rotor winding

<p>12.3 Changes in Rotor Speed

<p>In addition to modeling transients in the windings, which represent the electrical

<p>subsystem, it is necessary to model the mechanical subsystem of the machine and to
</p>
<p>derive differential equation describing changes in the rotor angular speed. The rotor
</p>
<p>is coupled to a work machine or a driving machine by means of its shaft. Equivalent
</p>
<p>inertia of all rotating parts is denoted by J. It comprises inertia of the rotor, shaft,

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>work machine, coupling elements, transmission elements, and of all the parts
</p>
<p>moving along with the rotor at speed Om. The rotor speed is affected by:
</p>
<p>&bull; Electromagnetic torque Tem
&bull; Friction torque kFOm
&bull; Load torque Tm
&bull; Inertial torque JdOm/dt
</p>
<p>According to notation presented in Fig. 12.1, reference direction for electromag-
</p>
<p>netic torque is positive, meaning that positive value of this torque acts in direction
</p>
<p>of increasing algebraic value of the rotor speed. Load torque Tm represents mechan-
</p>
<p>ical load of the work machine which resists to motion and affects the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>Reference direction of this torque is negative, meaning that positive value of this
</p>
<p>torque acts in the direction of reducing the algebraic value of the speed. Friction
</p>
<p>torque resists the motion in either direction; thus, it acts in the direction of reducing
</p>
<p>the speed absolute value. Inertial torque JdOm/dt represents the torque required to
</p>
<p>change the speed and provide the acceleration dOm/dt. Equation (12.8) expresses
</p>
<p>the balance of all the torque components mentioned above. As a matter of fact,
</p>
<p>(12.8) is Newton&rsquo;s second law of motion applied to rotation. Since the friction

<p>12.5 DC Machine with Permanent Magnets
</p>
<p>Figure 11.1 shows cross sections of DC machine with excitation winding on the
</p>
<p>stator and DC machine with permanent magnets on the stator. Excitation flux can
</p>
<p>be obtained by using a DC current If in excitation winding, which creates the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force and flux along direct axis of the machine. The machine can
</p>
<p>also be made without an excitation winding. Instead, permanent magnets can be
</p>
<p>inserted instead of main poles to provide the excitation flux. The advantage of
</p>
<p>having permanent magnets is the absence of the excitation winding. There is no
</p>
<p>need to have a separate power supply for the excitation winding. At the same time,
</p>
<p>the overall efficiency of the machine is increased due to absence of copper losses in
</p>
<p>the excitation winding. A disadvantage of DC machines with permanent magnet
</p>
<p>excitation is that the flux cannot be changed. The flux is defined by B(H)
</p>
<p>characteristics of the magnets and by the magnetic resistance of the magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit. Specifically, the flux is closely related to the remanent magnetic induction
</p>
<p>of permanent magnets. Hence, the permanent magnet excitation is not suitable for
</p>
<p>applications requiring variable flux. In machines with excitation winding, excita-
</p>
<p>tion flux can be varied by changing the excitation voltage and current.
</p>
<p>Mathematical model of DC machines with permanent magnets is obtained by
</p>
<p>removing one differential equation from the model derived in the preceding section.
</p>
<p>The flux Ff is constant and determined by characteristics of the magnet. Since a DC
</p>
<p>machine with permanent magnets does not have an excitation winding, the differ-
</p>
<p>ential equation describing the voltage balance in this winding is omitted.

<p>Excitation winding is a subsystem with excitation voltage at the input. The
</p>
<p>voltage is used as the control variable which determines the change of excitation
</p>
<p>current. The excitation current comes as a consequence or reaction to the excitation
</p>
<p>voltage. Therefore, the voltage is a control input, while the current is the output of
</p>
<p>the considered system. On the basis of the previous equation, the transfer function
</p>

the excitation winding ranges between 200 ms and 10 s. Variation of the armature

<p>The excitation voltage and armature voltage are inputs to the system. They are
</p>
<p>control variables that affect the state of DC machine. The armature current, excita-
</p>
<p>tion current, as well as the rotor speed are state variables of the considered dynamic
</p>
<p>system. The state variables are the reaction of the system to the external control
</p>
<p>variables. Variables such as the armature current, excitation flux, electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque, and the rotor speed are the system outputs.
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic torque Tem is equal to the product of the excitation flux, armature
</p>
<p>current, and constant km. Torque Tem represents input variable of the mechanical
</p>
<p>subsystem, that is, control force which determines variation of the rotor speed. Speed
</p>
<p>of rotation increases when Tem exceeds the sum of all torques resisting the
</p>
<p>movement. When the electromagnetic torque equals the sum of resisting torques,
</p>
<p>Tm &thorn; kFOm, the rotor speed remains constant. If Tem &lt; Tm &thorn; kFOm, the rotor speed
decreases. It should be noted that block (3) of the diagram corresponds to the friction
</p>
<p>torque kFOm. The friction torque is usually smaller than the rated torque by two
</p>
<p>orders of magnitude. Therefore, friction is often neglected, and the transfer function
</p>
<p>is represented by 1/(J�s).
</p>
<p>12.7 Torque Control
</p>
<p>Block (4) in Fig. 12.3 is denoted by R, and it does not belong to the mathematical
</p>
<p>model of DC machine. Connections of this block are made by dotted lines. This
</p>
<p>block illustrates the possibility of controlling the torque of the machine, which is
</p>
<p>discussed here. DC motors are often used in motion control applications, where
</p>
<p>they provide the means for controlling the speed and position of tools and
</p>
<p>workpieces in automated production lines. They are also used for running elevators,
</p>
<p>conveyors, and similar devices. In motion control tasks, electrical motors are used
</p>
<p>to provide a variable torque Tem which should be equal to the torque reference T
*,
</p>
<p>calculated within the motion controller which is not shown in the figure. The torque
</p>
<p>reference T*is determined so as to overcome the motion resistances and ensure
</p>
<p>desired speed and/or position. Its change depends on desired speed changes and on
</p>
<p>forces and torques resisting the motion. The torque Tem should be as close to the
</p>
<p>reference T* as possible. Torque control implies a set of actions and measures
</p>
<p>conceived to maintain the electromagnetic torque Tem at the desired reference value
</p>
<p>T*. In cases where the reference changes, controlled variable Tem should track these
</p>
<p>changes. The torque Tem is proportional to the product of the armature current and
</p>
<p>the flux. At the first glimpse, the torque control can be done either by changing the
</p>
<p>flux or by changing the armature current. Yet, only the later approach is used in
</p>
<p>practice. This is due to the fact that the flux changes are rather slow. Moreover, flux
</p>
<p>control is not available with DC machines having permanent magnet excitation.
</p>
<p>With DC machines having an excitation winding, the time constant of the armature
</p>
<p>308 12 Modeling and Supplying DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>winding ta is considerably smaller than the time constant of the excitation winding.
</p>
<p>While only slow variations of the flux are possible, the current ia can be changed
</p>
<p>quickly. Thus, regulation of the torque implies regulation of the armature current.
</p>
<p>The speed of the torque response is defined by the speed of response of the armature
</p>
<p>current. Starting from the voltage balance equation of the armature winding,
</p>
<p>variation of the current is determined by equation
</p>
<p>dia
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14; 1
</p>
<p>La
ua � Raia � Ea&eth; &THORN;: (12.10)
</p>
<p>Therefore, variations of the armature current can be accomplished by varying the
</p>
<p>armature voltage ua. For this reason, DC motors are supplied from static power
</p>
<p>converters, power electronic devices that provide variable armature voltage. For the
</p>
<p>purpose of current control, it is necessary to measure the armature current and
</p>
<p>compare it to the reference in order to establish the error Dia &frac14; i* � ia. If the
armature current is below the reference (Dia &gt; 0), armature voltage should be
increased in order to obtain dia/dt &gt; 0. From (12.10), it can be concluded that
increasing armature voltage leads to increasing armature current; thus, error Dia is
</p>
<p>reduced. In a like manner, if the current is too high (Dia &lt; 0), the voltage should be
reduced. The algorithm that calculates the control variable u* from the error Dia is
</p>
<p>called control algorithm. Device or block diagram which implements such algo-
</p>
<p>rithm is called regulator or controller. Regulator can often be described by transfer
</p>
<p>function. The error Dia is an input to the regulator, while the control variable u
* is
</p>

<p>Hence, design of the regulator structure and setting of its parameters are left out of

<p>12.8 Steady-State Equivalent Circuit
</p>
<p>It is of interest to analyze the steady-state operation of DC machines. In steady
</p>
<p>state, there are no changes in the rotor speed nor in electrical currents in the
</p>
<p>windings. During transients, instantaneous value of electrical current is denoted
</p>
<p>by i(t), while in steady state it is denoted by I. Steady state in excitation winding is
</p>
<p>defined by equation Uf &frac14; RfIf. This relation is represented by the equivalent circuit
</p>
<p>12.8 Steady-State Equivalent Circuit 309</p>

<p>given in the left-hand part of Fig. 12.4. The voltage balance equation of the
</p>
<p>armature winding is given by expression
</p>
<p>Ua &frac14; Ra � Ia &thorn; ke � Ff � Om:
</p>
<p>Therefore, the steady-state value of the armature current is Ia &frac14; (Ua � Ea)/Ra,
where Ua is the voltage fed to the brushes. This equation can be represented by the
</p>
<p>steady-state equivalent circuit given in the right-hand part of Fig. 12.4. The circuit
</p>
<p>can be used for determination of the current, torque, and power of a DC machine.
</p>
<p>Given the rotor speed and the excitation flux, one can calculate the electromotive
</p>
<p>force, find the difference Ua � Ea, determine the armature current Ia, and find the
torque and power. In cases where the voltage and current are known, the equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit can be used to calculate the electromotive force and determine the rotor
</p>
<p>speed according to expression Om &frac14; Ea/(keFf).
The voltage Ua between the brushes A and B in Fig. 12.4 is equal to
</p>
<p>Ua &frac14; RaIa + Ea. When DC machine is used as a motor, it is supplied from an
external source of DC voltage. This source is shown in Fig. 12.4. It has internal
</p>
<p>resistance Rm and no load voltage Um. With Rm � 0, the armature voltage Ua is
approximately equal to Um. Further on, whenever the armature voltage is supplied
</p>
<p>from an external source Um, it is assumed that Ua &frac14; Um.
Question (12.3): For a DC machine, it is known that keFf &frac14; kmFf &frac14; NRFf/(2p) &frac14;

</p>
<p>provides the load torque Tm. Machine runs in steady state, where the electromag-
</p>
<p>netic torque Tem is equal to the load torque Tm. The rotor speed is constant and equal
</p>
<p>toOm &frac14; 100 rad/s. The armature winding is fed from a voltage source Ua &frac14; 110 V.
Equivalent resistance of the armature winding is Ra &frac14; 1 O. (1) Determine the
electromagnetic torque, power delivered by the source, and power of electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical conversion. (2) Assuming that the rotor shaft is decoupled from the work
</p>
<p>machine, and a new steady state is reached, determine the rotor speed. (3) Assume
</p>
<p>that the rotor shaft is coupled to the work machine which maintains the rotor speed
</p>
<p>at Om &frac14; 100 rad/s, notwithstanding changes in electromagnetic torque Tem. If the
source voltage is reduced to 90 V, determine the electromagnetic torque and power
</p>
<p>of electromechanical conversion in new steady-state conditions.

<p>Answer (12.3):

</p>
<p>generator mode.
</p>
<p>12.9 Mechanical Characteristic
</p>
<p>Mechanical characteristic of a DC machine is a curve in Tem&ndash;Om plane which
</p>
<p>relates the torque and speed in steady-state operation, where the load torque Tm,
</p>
<p>the armature voltage Ua, and the excitation voltage Uf remain constant and do not
</p>
<p>change. It can be expressed either as Tem(Om) or as Om(Tem).
</p>
<p>The following considerations assume that a DC machine runs in the steady state.
</p>
<p>It has constant excitation flux and constant voltage Ua applied to the armature
</p>
<p>winding. In Fig. 12.5, it is shown that an external voltage source Um is connected
</p>
<p>to the brushes, providing the required armature voltage. The voltage balance equa-
</p>
<p>tion is Um &frac14; Ua &frac14; RaIa + keFfOm. In conditions where the armature current is
equal to zero, the electromotive force is equal to the supply voltage. Therefore,
</p>
<p>with Ia &frac14; 0, the rotor angular speed is O0 &frac14; Um/(keFf). In this condition, the
electromagnetic torque Tem is equal to zero as well. Therefore, the speedO0 is called
</p>
<p>no load speed. With constant supply voltage Um and with Ea &frac14; keFfOm &frac14; Um �
RaIa, any increase in armature current reduces the electromotive force. With con-
</p>
<p>stant flux, the electromotive force is proportional to the rotor speed. Therefore, an
</p>
<p>increase in armature current decreases the rotor speed. On the other hand, the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque Tem is proportional to the armature current. In steady-state
</p>
<p>conditions, Tem &frac14; Tm &frac14; kmFfIa. Hence, any increase in the load torque decreases
the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>The following considerations assume that DC machine runs in the steady state.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the rotor speed is constant; hence, J�dOm/dt &frac14; 0. With friction torque
being neglected, the load torque Tm is equal to the electromagnetic torque Tem.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the Newton equation reduces to Tem &frac14; Tm + kF�Om � Tm. Hence, in the
steady state and with no friction, the electromagnetic torque matches the load
</p>
<p>torque. Therefore, the armature current Ia &frac14; Tem/(kmFf) is proportional to the
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.5 Supplying
armature winding from a
</p>
<p>constant voltage source
</p>
<p>12.9 Mechanical Characteristic 311</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>load torque Tm. For that reason, an increase in the load torque Tm results in an
</p>
<p>increase of the armature current, hence decreasing the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>Previous considerations are drawn for steady-state operation of DC machine
</p>
<p>with constant supply voltages and constant load torque. They show that the rotor
</p>
<p>speed decreases with the load torque and, hence, with the electromagnetic torque.
</p>
<p>Steady-state relation of the speed and torque is called mechanical characteristic,
</p>
<p>and it can be represented by a curve in Tem&ndash;Om or Om&ndash;Tem plane. While the steady-
</p>
<p>state equivalent circuit relates the voltages and currents at electrical terminals of a
</p>
<p>DC machine, the mechanical characteristic relates the rotor speed and torque at
</p>
<p>the rotor shaft, wherein the shaft represents the mechanical access to the machine.
</p>
<p>The mechanical characteristic depends on the supply voltages and DC machine
</p>
<p>parameters. Variations in armature voltage Ua affect the no load speed O0 and alter
</p>
<p>the mechanical characteristic Tem(Om). Variation in excitation voltage changes the
</p>
<p>excitation current and flux, changing in such way the mechanical characteristic.
</p>
<p>Mechanical characteristic can be determined by starting from voltage balance
</p>
<p>equation for the armature winding, given in (12.6). Calculation of function Tem(Om)
</p>
<p>starts with Tem &frac14; kmFfIa. It is required to express the armature current in terms of
the rotor speed. From voltage balance equation Ua &frac14; RaIa + keFfOm, depicting the
voltage balance in armature winding in the steady state, the armature current is
</p>
<p>found to be
</p>
<p>Ia &frac14;
Um � Ea
</p>
<p>Ra
&frac14; Um � ke FfOm
</p>
<p>Ra

</p>
<p>and the electromagnetic torque is calculated according to expression

<p>&frac14; T0 � S � Om:
(12.11)
</p>
<p>Torque T0 &frac14; kmFfUm/Ra in (12.11) is start-up torque, the electromagnetic torque
developed by DC machine when the rotor is at standstill. If the rotor speed is zero,
</p>
<p>the induced electromotive force is zero as well, and the armature winding has start-
</p>
<p>up current I0 &frac14; Um/Ra. It will be shown later that the start-up current has very large
values which could damage the machine or power supply feeding the machine.
</p>
<p>In order to restrain the armature current to acceptable values, at low speeds, it is
</p>
<p>necessary to reduce the armature voltage. This can be accomplished by adjusting the
</p>
<p>power supply voltage Um according to the rotor speed. In cases where the power
</p>
<p>supply is not adjustable, it is necessary to connect a series resistor in order to increase
</p>
<p>the total resistance SR of the armature circuit and hence limit the current. Parameter
</p>
<p>S in expression (12.11) is the slope or the stiffness of mechanical characteristic.
</p>
<p>Slope S of mechanical characteristic Tem &frac14; T0 � SOm determines the ratio between
the torque change DTem and the speed change DOm. Large stiffness means that small
</p>
<p>variations of the rotor speed would result in large variations of the torque.
</p>
<p>312 12 Modeling and Supplying DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Similarly to electrical machines which have their own mechanical characteristic
</p>
<p>Tem(Om), work machines connected to the rotor shaft have mechanical characte-
</p>
<p>ristics Tm(Om) of their own, determining the change of the load torque with the rotor
</p>
<p>speed. Characteristic Tm(Om) is called load characteristic. Since the steady state is
</p>
<p>reached with Tm &frac14; Tem, the steady-state operating point in T&ndash;Om plane is at the
intersection of the two mechanical characteristics, the one of the electrical machine
</p>
<p>and the one of the load. In Fig. 12.6, the load characteristic is represented by a
</p>
<p>straight line L. There are two different mechanical characteristics of a DC machine
</p>
<p>shown in the figure, K1 and K2. The characteristics K1 and K2 are obtained for
</p>
<p>different supply voltages of the armature winding. If DC machine has characteristic
</p>
<p>K1, steady state is reached at point (T1, O1). With characteristic K2, steady state is
</p>
<p>reached at point (T2, O2). Therefore, it is possible to change mechanical character-
</p>
<p>istic of the machine and change the steady-state speed and torque by varying the
</p>
<p>armature supply voltage Um &frac14; Ua.
</p>
<p>12.9.1 Stable Equilibrium
</p>
<p>The equilibrium reached at the intersection of the two mechanical characteristics
</p>
<p>can be stable or unstable. When the operating point is displaced from the stable
</p>
<p>equilibrium by action of external disturbances, it returns to the same point after
</p>
<p>certain transient phenomena. The unstable equilibrium is retained only in the
</p>
<p>absence of disturbances. When the operating point is displaced from the unstable
</p>
<p>equilibrium, it does not return to the same point. An example of an unstable
</p>
<p>equilibrium is a ball positioned precisely at the peak of the hill. Left alone, it
</p>
<p>remains at the peak. Any disturbance would move the ball OFF the peak and make
</p>
<p>it roll all the way down the slope.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Stability of the steady-state operating point depends on the stiffness of the two
</p>
<p>mechanical characteristics. From the mechanical characteristic of DC machine
</p>
<p>Tem &frac14; T0 � SemOm and load characteristic Tm &frac14; T0m � SmOm, it can be concluded
that the speed change DOm results in the electromagnetic torque change of
</p>
<p>DTem &frac14; �SemDOm and the load torque change of DTm &frac14; �SmDOm. The influence
of parameters Sem and Sm on dynamic behavior of the system comprising one DC
</p>
<p>machine and one work machine can be studied by starting from the steady-state
</p>
<p>operating point where the DC machine runs at angular speed O1 and develops
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque T1, while the load machine resists to motion by the same
</p>
<p>torque,Tm &frac14; T1. In steady state, the speeddoesnot change, andNewton equation reads
</p>
<p>J
dOm
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14; Tem � Tm &frac14; T1 � T1 &frac14; 0:
</p>
<p>The system is susceptible to external disturbances that may produce small
</p>
<p>changes of the torque and speed. If a small variation of the rotor speed DOm occurs
</p>
<p>for any reason, the rotor speed becomes O1 + DOm, while the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque changes to T1 � SemDOm. At the same time, the load torque becomes
T1 � SmDOm. Since O1 is a constant, Newton equation becomes
</p>

&frac14; Sm � Sem&eth; &THORN;DOm: (12.12)
</p>
<p>With Sm � Sem &gt; 0, a positive value of DOm gives a positive value of the first
derivative d(DOm)/dt. Therefore, disturbance DOm will progressively increase. A
</p>
<p>negative disturbance DOm gives a negative value of the first derivative d(DOm)/dt.
</p>
<p>In this case, disturbance will progressively advance toward negative values of ever
</p>
<p>larger magnitude. Hence, the steady-state operating point with Sm � Sem &gt; 0 is
unstable. Namely, any disturbance, whatever the size and however small, puts the
</p>
<p>system into instability.
</p>
<p>With Sm � Sem &lt; 0, a positive value of DOm gives a negative value of the first
derivative d(DOm)/dt. Therefore, disturbance DOm will decrease and gradually
</p>
<p>converge toward zero, bringing the system to the original steady-state operating
</p>
<p>point. This dynamic behavior is called stable since the system returns to the initial
</p>
<p>steady state after being disturbed and moved from the equilibrium. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, systems that progressively move away from the initial state and do not return
</p>
<p>are called unstable.

<p>12.10 Properties of Mechanical Characteristic
</p>
<p>Mechanical characteristic of a DC machine is shown in Fig. 12.7, including the
</p>
<p>intersection with the abscissa and ordinate. The intersection with the ordinate
</p>
<p>represents no load speed O0. This speed is achieved when the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque is equal to zero. With zero torque, the armature current is equal to zero as
</p>
<p>well. In the absence of the voltage drop RaIa, the electromotive force keFfOm is
</p>
<p>equal to the armature voltage. On the basis of (12.11), no load speed is

</p>
<p>S
Tem: (12.17)
</p>
<p>Power supply of the armature winding has a finite internal resistance, as well as
</p>
<p>the conductors connecting the supply to the brushes. In addition, the armature
</p>
<p>circuit may have a resistor inserted in series with the purpose of reducing the initial
</p>
<p>current and initial torque. At the same time, series resistor may be used to alter the
</p>
<p>mechanical characteristic and change the rotor speed. In practice, total resistance in
</p>
<p>the armature circuit is higher than the equivalent resistance Ra of the armature
</p>
<p>winding and mechanical collector. For this reason, expressions (12.11), (12.14), and
</p>
<p>(12.16) should use SR instead of Ra. Notation SR represents the sum of all
</p>
<p>resistances in the armature circuit, namely, the sum of internal resistance of the
</p>
<p>power source, resistance of wiring and connections, inserted series resistances, and
</p>
<p>the equivalent resistance of the armature winding, collector, and brushes.
</p>
<p>12.11 Speed Regulation
</p>
<p>In cases without inserted series resistances, total resistance of the armature circuit
</p>
<p>SR is very small. In practice, resistance Ra of DC machines in conjunction with
</p>
<p>usually encountered armature currents Ia results in a voltage drop RaIa of only Ua/
</p>
<p>1,000 .. Ua/100, where Ua is the armature voltage in most common operating
</p>
<p>conditions. Hence, the value of Ra ranges from (Ua/Ia)/1,000 to (Ua/Ia)/100. There-
</p>
<p>fore, the slope S of the mechanical characteristic is relatively high. This means that,
</p>
<p>during variations of the torque, variations of the speed will be very small. From
</p>
<p>(12.17), a high value of the slope S of the mechanical characteristic ensures that the
</p>
<p>rotor speed has only slight changes and remains close to the no load speed.
</p>
<p>According to (12.13), no load speed is determined by the armature voltage
</p>
<p>Ua &frac14; Um. Therefore, the speed can be changed by varying the armature voltage.
</p>
<p>316 12 Modeling and Supplying DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In cases where the rotor speed is to be varied while the power source voltageUm is
</p>
<p>constant, the armature voltage and the speed can be changed by inserting a variable
</p>
<p>series resistance Rext in the armature circuit. In this way, the armature voltage is
</p>
<p>reduced to Ua &frac14; Um � RextIa, and this reduces the rotor speed. Insertion of a
variable series resistance is a simple but inefficient way of controlling the rotor
</p>
<p>speed. The power losses due to Joule effect in series resistance are proportional to the
</p>
<p>square of the armature current. More efficient way of controlling the speed is the use
</p>
<p>of power source that provides variable voltage Um. Continuous and lossless change
</p>
<p>of the armature voltage is feasible with static power converters that employ semi-
</p>
<p>conductor power switches.
</p>
<p>In conditions where Rext &frac14; 0, variation of the supply voltage Um changes the no
load speed and maintains the slope of the mechanical characteristic. Equation
</p>
<p>(12.16) proves that changes in Um do not affect the slope S of the mechanical
</p>
<p>characteristic. On the other hand, no load speed O0 is proportional to the supply
</p>
<p>voltage (12.13). By changing the supply voltage Um, a family of mechanical
</p>
<p>characteristics is obtained, all of them having the same slope. Supply voltage Um
determines the intersection of each of these characteristics with the Om axis of the
</p>
<p>Tem&ndash;Om plane, as shown in Fig. 12.8. As a matter of fact, changes in the armature
</p>
<p>supply voltage result in translation of the mechanical characteristic in direction of
</p>
<p>Om axis. Translation of the mechanical characteristic can be used to change the
</p>
<p>intersection with the load characteristic and, hence, change the running speed for
</p>
<p>the given load. In other words, the rotor speed can be changed by altering the
</p>
<p>armature supply voltage. In Fig. 12.8, mechanical characteristics K1, K2, K3, and
</p>
<p>K4 are given, each one obtained with different armature voltage. Characteristic K4 is
</p>
<p>obtained for the case when the armature supply voltage is equal to zero. This
</p>
<p>characteristic passes through the origin.
</p>
<p>Diagram in Fig. 12.8 is divided in four quadrants. In quadrant I, the rotor speed and
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque both have positive values. Their product represents the power
</p>
<p>of electromechanical conversion, and it has positive value in the first quadrant, where
</p>
<p>the electrical machine operates as a motor. In the second and fourth quadrants,
</p>
<p>direction of the electromagnetic torque is opposite to direction of the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>In these quadrants, torque and speed have opposite signs, and their product assumes a
</p>
<p>negative value. In these quadrants, the power of electromechanical conversion is
</p>
<p>negative, and the machine operates as a generator. In generator mode, electrical
</p>
<p>machine creates electromagnetic torque which resists the motion, namely, it brakes
</p>
<p>and acts toward decreasing the rotor speed. To keep the rotor running, generator
</p>
<p>requires water turbines, steam turbines, or other similar devices that provide the
</p>
<p>driving torque that runs the rotor and maintains the rotor speed. In the third quadrant,
</p>
<p>the machine operates in the motor mode, quite like in the first quadrant. The
</p>
<p>difference is that both torque and speed in the third quadrant are negative.
</p>
<p>The need for DC machines to operate in one or more quadrants depends upon the
</p>
<p>mechanical load or work machine used in actual application. A DC machine can be
</p>
<p>used to run a fan in a blower application. Direction of the air flow does not change.
</p>
<p>For that reason, DC motor runs in the same direction, without a need to change
</p>
<p>direction of the rotor speed. The air resistance produces the load torque which is
</p>
<p>12.11 Speed Regulation 317</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>opposite to the rotor speed. Hence, direction of the torque Tm &frac14; Tem does not
change either. Hence, a DC machine used in typical blower application operates
</p>
<p>in the first quadrant.
</p>
<p>A number of DC machines are used to control the motion of various parts, tools,
</p>
<p>objects, or vehicles. The motion is usually made in both directions. The speed has
</p>
<p>positive sign while moving in one direction and negative sign while moving in the
</p>
<p>other direction. Moreover, each motion cycle starts with an acceleration phase,
</p>
<p>where the speed increases, and ends with a braking phase, when the speed is
</p>
<p>decreased and brought back to zero (Fig. 12.10). In acceleration, the torque has the
</p>
<p>same direction as the speed, while in braking phase, the torque changes direction and
</p>
<p>acts against the speed. Hence, motion from one position to another involves the
</p>
<p>torque of both directions and the speed in only one direction. Coming back to
</p>
<p>the original position (Fig. 12.10) involves the speed of the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>Therefore, a forth-and-back motion requires the speed and torque changes with all
</p>
<p>the four possible combinations of signs, (Tem &gt; 0, Om &gt; 0), (Tem &lt; 0, Om &gt; 0),
(Tem &gt; 0, Om &lt; 0), and (Tem &lt; 0, Om &lt; 0). In other words, it is required to
accomplish the four-quadrant operation.
</p>
<p>Question (12.5): A work machine resists the motion by developing the torque
Tm &frac14; 0,001 O2. For a DC motor with independent excitation and with constant
excitation flux, the following parameters are known: Ra &frac14; 0.1 O, kmFf &frac14; 1 Wb,
and Ua &frac14; 100 V. Determine speed of rotation in steady state.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Answer (12.5):Steady-state values of the electromagnetic torque Tem and the load
torque Tm are equal. The steady-state speed corresponds to the intersection of the
</p>
<p>mechanical characteristic of the motor and the load characteristic. On the basis of
</p>
<p>(12.11), the electromagnetic torque is Tem &frac14; T0 � SOm. For the given parameters,
T0 &frac14; 1�100/0.1 Nm &frac14; 1,000 Nm, while S &frac14; 1�1/0.1 Nm�s/rad. Equation
Tem(Om) &frac14; Tm(Om) results in a quadratic equation in terms of Om. Positive solution
of this quadratic equation is 99.02 rad/s, which is the speed of the considered system
</p>
<p>at steady state.
</p>
<p>12.12 DC Generator
</p>
<p>DC machines can operate in the generator mode. If the rotor is put to motion by
</p>
<p>means of a steam or hydroturbine, the machine receives mechanical work which is
</p>
<p>converted to electrical energy. Mechanical power supplied to the shaft is the product
</p>
<p>of the rotor speed and the turbine torque TT which keeps the rotor in motion and
</p>
<p>maintains the speed. With rotor in motion, the electromotive force Ea &frac14; keFfOm is
induced in the armature winding, and it is available between the brushes. The voltage
</p>
<p>Ua can be used to supply DC electrical loads such as the light bulbs, heaters, and
</p>
<p>similar. The armature voltage of DC generator is often denoted by UG. With a
</p>
<p>resistive load connected between the brushes, the load current is established in
</p>
<p>direction which is opposite to the adopted reference direction of the armature current
</p>
<p>Ia. Respecting the reference direction of the armature current, electrical current in
</p>
<p>generator mode has negative sign. For this reason, analysis of DC generators is often
</p>
<p>made by assuming a new reference direction of the current, opposite to the one used
</p>
<p>in motoring mode. Equivalent circuit in Fig. 12.9 includes electrical current IG &frac14;
�Ia which circulates from brush B to brush A. Brush A represents positive pole of
the voltage supplied to electrical consumers. Starting from equation
</p>
<p>UG &frac14; Ua &frac14; RaIa &thorn; keFfOm;
</p>
<p>and introducing substitution IG &frac14; �Ia, one obtains
</p>
<p>UG &frac14; keFfOm � RaIG &frac14; Ea � RaIG; (12.18)
</p>
<p>which determines variation of the generator voltage as function of consumer current
</p>
<p>IG. Starting from (12.18), the current&ndash;voltage characteristic is obtained, given in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.9. No load voltage is equal to Ea. Slope DU/DI determines the voltage drop
</p>
<p>experienced by electrical consumers. The voltage drop DU is proportional to the
</p>
<p>consumer current. The slope DU/DI is equal to the armature resistance Ra. In cases
</p>
<p>when the electrical load is connected over long lines with considerable resistance,
</p>
<p>the slope DU/DI is equal to the sum of the armature resistance and the line
</p>
<p>resistances.
</p>
<p>12.12 DC Generator 319</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When supplying electrical consumers and loads operating with DC currents, it is
</p>
<p>of interest to keep the supply voltage constant. Due to the voltage drop DU caused
</p>
<p>by a finite resistance of the armature winding, the voltage across consumers
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.9 Voltage&ndash;current characteristic of a DC generator
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.10 Variations of the position, speed, and torque within one cycle
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>depends on the load current. In order to keep the voltage UG at the desired value
</p>
<p>notwithstanding the changes in electrical current, it is required to increase the
</p>
<p>electromotive force and maintain the voltage Ea � RaIG. In practical applications,
it is necessary to measure the voltage UG, to compare the measurement with the
</p>
<p>desired value, and then to adjust the excitation voltage and current in order to obtain
</p>
<p>the excitation flux which results in desired electromotive force. The voltage across
</p>
<p>the load UG &frac14; Ea � RaIG remains constant if the changes in the voltage drop RaIG
are matched and compensated for by contemporary changes of the electromotive
</p>
<p>force Ea. In the prescribed way, it is possible to achieve the voltage regulation of a
</p>
<p>DC generator.
</p>
<p>When a DC generator supplies resistive load which absorbs the current IG &gt; 0,
the armature current is then Ia &frac14; �IG &lt; 0. Since the armature current Ia is nega-
tive, the electromagnetic torque Tem is negative as well. With Tem &lt; 0, the electro-
magnetic torque resists the motion and acts against the rotor speed. In other words,
</p>
<p>DC machine provides a braking torque. Therefore, the power of electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversion Pem &frac14; TemOm is negative. This means that the mechanical work is being
converted to electrical energy. The generator receives mechanical work from a
</p>
<p>driving turbine by means of the shaft. The product of the driving torque TT of the
</p>
<p>turbine and the rotor speed represents mechanical power which is delivered to
</p>
<p>the machine. The torque TT acts in the direction opposite to the previously adopted
</p>
<p>reference direction for the load torque Tm. With reference directions shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.1, the generator mode implies Tem &lt; 0 and Tm &lt; 0.
</p>
<p>Question (12.6): A hydroturbine drives DC generator at angular speed of Om
&frac14; 100 rad/s. The parameters Ra &frac14; 1 O and kmFf &frac14; 1 Wb are known, while the
resistance of the load connected between the brushes is RL &frac14; 4 O. Determine the
voltage across the load, the torque TT &frac14; �Tem delivered to the rotor by the turbine,
the turbine power PT &frac14; TTom, and the power PG &frac14; UaIG delivered to the load.Why
is PT &gt; PG?
</p>
<p>Answer (12.6): Electromotive force of the generator is Ea &frac14; 100 V. Generator
current is IG &frac14; �Ia &frac14; 100 V/(1 O + 4 O) &frac14; 20 A. Voltage across the consumer is
80 V. The electromagnetic torque is �1�20 Nm &frac14; �20 Nm. The turbine torque
is TT &frac14; �Tem &frac14; 20 Nm. The turbine power is PT &frac14; 2,000 W. The power delivered
to the consumer is PG &frac14; 1,600 W. The difference RaIa2 &frac14; 400 W is converted to
heat in the rotor windings.
</p>
<p>12.13 Topologies of DC Machine Power Supplies
</p>
<p>Whether used as electrical motors or generators, DCmachines are often connected to
</p>
<p>static power converters. Variable speed applications require continuous voltage
</p>
<p>change of the power supply connected to the armature winding. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>DC voltages obtained from DC networks or batteries are mostly constant. Cases
</p>
<p>where a variable voltage DC load such as DC machine has to be connected to a
</p>
<p>12.13 Topologies of DC Machine Power Supplies 321</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>constant voltage source are frequently encountered. In such cases, it is necessary to
</p>
<p>use aDC/DC static power converter which conditions the armature voltage according
</p>
<p>to needs.Moreover, DCmachines are often supplied fromACmains. In these cases, it
</p>
<p>is necessary to use static power converter which converts constant AC voltages in
</p>
<p>adjustable DC voltage. Most common topologies of static power converters used
</p>
<p>in conjunction with DC machines are discussed in the following section.
</p>
<p>12.13.1 Armature Power Supply Requirements
</p>
<p>A DC motor takes electrical energy from power source, performs electromechani-
</p>
<p>cal conversion, and delivers mechanical work to the output shaft. Electrical motors
</p>
<p>are usually cylindrical rotating machines which deliver the driving torque to work
</p>
<p>machines by means of the rotor shaft and subsequent mechanical couplings.
</p>
<p>Mechanical power delivered to work machine is determined by the product of the
</p>
<p>driving torque and the speed of rotation.
</p>
<p>It is of interest to specify the required characteristics of the power source supply-
</p>
<p>ing the armature winding. A DC motor is mainly used for controlling the motion of
</p>
<p>tools, workpieces, semifinished articles, finished articles, packaging machines,
</p>
<p>manipulators, vehicles, and other objects. A typical motion cycle includes start
</p>
<p>from initial position, motion toward the targeted position, reaching the target and
</p>
<p>resting at the target position, and then turning back to the initial position. Represen-
</p>
<p>tative motion cycle is depicted in Fig. 12.10 by typical changes in the position ym,
</p>
<p>speed Om, and torque Tem in the course of moving from the start position to the target
</p>
<p>and coming back. In order to get a closer specification for the armature power supply,
</p>
<p>it is of interest to observe the torque and speed changes during this motion.
</p>
<p>Characteristic phases of the motion cycle are denoted by numbers 1 to 4. In
</p>
<p>phase 1, the torque has positive value, and it accelerates the motor, increasing the
</p>
<p>speed and initiating the motion toward target position. It is observed in Fig. 12.10
</p>
<p>that the desired speed is reached soon and then the torque reduces while the speed
</p>
<p>remains constant. In constant speed interval between the phases 1 and 2, the torque
</p>
<p>is very low. With constant speed and with no need to provide the acceleration
</p>
<p>torque JdOm/dt, the torque reduces to a very small friction, and it is considered as
</p>
<p>equal to zero. In phase 2, position ym gets close to the target position. For this
</p>
<p>reason, it is necessary to brake and reduce the speed. Negative torque is developed
</p>
<p>in order to reduce the speed to zero and eventually stop at the target position. In the
</p>
<p>course of coming back to the initial position, the speed and torque required in
</p>
<p>phases 3 and 4 are of the opposite direction compared to the speed and torque
</p>
<p>required in phases 1 and 2. It can be concluded that the motion cycle given in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.10 comprises the following four combinations of the speed and torque
</p>
<p>directions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Tem &gt; 0, Om &gt; 0 (phase 1)
&bull; Tem &lt; 0, Om &gt; 0 (phase 2)
</p>
<p>322 12 Modeling and Supplying DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Tem &lt; 0, Om &lt; 0 (phase 3)
&bull; Tem &gt; 0, Om &lt; 0 (phase 4)
</p>
<p>In the first and third phases, the electrical machine operates in motor mode,
</p>
<p>while in the second and fourth phases, it operates in generator mode. Hence,
</p>
<p>throughout the motion cycle depicted in Fig. 12.10, the operating point (Tem&ndash;Om)
</p>
<p>has to pass through all the four quadrants of the torque-speed plane. This can be
</p>
<p>used to specify the armature power supply and define the required voltages and
</p>
<p>currents. The torque Tem &frac14; kmFf Ia is determined by the armature current. Direc-
tion of the electromagnetic torque is determined by the sign of the armature
</p>
<p>current Ia. At the same time, the voltage drop RaIa is often neglected, and the
</p>
<p>armature voltage Ua is assumed to be close to the induced electromotive force
</p>
<p>Ea &frac14; keFfOm. Therefore, the sign of the voltage Ua is determined by direction of
the rotor speed. With Ua � keFfOm and Ia &frac14; Tem/(kmFf), the change of the
operating point in Tem&ndash;Om plane can be used to envisage the required voltages
</p>
<p>and currents in (Ia � Ua) plane. In this way, it is possible to specify the
characteristics of the power source intended for supplying the armature winding.
</p>
<p>From the previous conclusions and from relations Tem &frac14; kmFf Ia and Ua � Ea &frac14;
keFfOm, it can be concluded that, in the course of motion cycle depicted in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.10, the voltage and current of the armature winding change signs in the
</p>
<p>following way:
</p>
<p>&bull; Ia &gt; 0, Ua &gt; 0 (phase 1)
&bull; Ia &lt; 0, Ua &gt; 0 (phase 2)
&bull; Ia &lt; 0, Ua &lt; 0 (phase 3)
&bull; Ia &gt; 0, Ua &lt; 0 (phase 4)
</p>
<p>Therefore, the power source for supplying the armature winding should provide
</p>
<p>voltages and currents of both directions and in all the four combinations. These
</p>
<p>requirements are crucial for the topology of the static power converter intended for
</p>
<p>supplying the DC machine.
</p>
<p>There are applications of DC motors where the speed and torque do not change
</p>
<p>the sign. In these cases, the power source supplying the armature winding is more
</p>
<p>simple. In earlier mentioned example of a fan driver, the machine operates in the
</p>
<p>first quadrant, and armature winding can be supplied by a static power converter
</p>
<p>with strictly positive voltages and currents, Ia &gt; 0 and Ua &gt; 0.
</p>
<p>12.13.2 Four Quadrants in T&ndash;V and U&ndash;I Diagrams
</p>
<p>If a DC machine is used to effectuate the motion shown in Fig. 12.10, in different
</p>
<p>phases of this motion, it passes through all the four quadrants of the T&ndash;O plane.
</p>
<p>If direction of the excitation flux does not change, direction of the torque is
</p>
<p>determined by direction of the armature current, while direction of the electro-
</p>
<p>motive force is determined by direction of the angular rotor speed. Applying the
</p>
<p>12.13 Topologies of DC Machine Power Supplies 323</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>torque-current relation (Tem &frac14; kmFfIa) and the voltage-speed relation (Ua � Ea &frac14;
keFfOm), the quadrants of the T&ndash;O plane and the quadrants of the U&ndash;I plane can be
</p>
<p>shown by the common Fig. 12.11.
</p>
<p>12.13.2.1 I Quadrant
</p>
<p>The machine develops a positive torque and rotates in reference direction; thus,
</p>
<p>Tem &gt; 0 andOm &gt; 0. The armature voltage and current are positive due toUa � Ea
and Ea ~ Om and due to Ia ~ Tem &gt; 0. Power taken from the source is positive,
Pi &frac14; UaIa &gt; 0. Power of electromechanical conversion is also positive,
Pem &frac14; TemOm &frac14; EaIa &gt; 0. The machine operates in motor mode.
</p>
<p>12.13.2.2 II Quadrant
</p>
<p>The machine develops a negative torque, while the rotor speed is positive consid-
</p>
<p>ering the reference direction; thus, Tem &lt; 0 and Om &gt; 0. The armature voltage is
positive, but the current is negative. Power taken from the source is negative
</p>
<p>because the voltage and current do not have the same sign. Power of the electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical conversion is also negative because the direction of the torque and speed
</p>
<p>does not have the same sign. The machine operates in the generator mode; there-
</p>
<p>fore, it resists the motion and brakes.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.13.2.3 III Quadrant
</p>
<p>The machine develops a negative torque and rotates opposite to the reference
</p>
<p>direction; thus, Tem &lt; 0 and Om &lt; 0. The armature voltage and current are nega-
tive because Ua � Ea ~ Om &lt; 0, while Ia ~ Tem &lt; 0. Power taken from the source
is positive, Pi &frac14; UaIa &gt; 0. Power of the electromechanical conversion is also
positive, Pem &frac14; TemOm &frac14; EaIa &gt; 0. The machine operates in the motor mode.
</p>
<p>12.13.2.4 IV Quadrant
</p>
<p>The machine develops a positive torque and rotates opposite to the reference
</p>
<p>direction; thus, Tem &gt; 0 and Om &lt; 0. The armature current is positive, but the
voltage is negative. Power taken from the source is negative because the voltage
</p>
<p>and current do not have the same signs. Power of the electromechanical conversion
</p>
<p>is also negative because the torque acts in direction opposite to the speed. The
</p>
<p>machine operates in the generator mode. It resists the motion and brakes.
</p>
<p>12.13.3 The Four-Quadrant Power Converter
</p>
<p>Topology of the static power converter which is used for supplying armature
</p>
<p>winding of a DC machine supporting the motion cycle shown in Fig. 12.10 is
</p>
<p>presented in this section. Electrical circuit of the power converter is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.12. The basic requirements are described in previous section. The converter
</p>
<p>should supply the armature winding by variable voltages and variable currents in all
</p>
<p>four possible combinations of their polarities.
</p>
<p>In the left-hand part of the figure, E denotes a DC supply with constant voltage
</p>
<p>which feeds the static power converter. The voltage E is obtained either from a
</p>
<p>battery or a rectifier. The rectifier is a static power converter comprising diodes or
</p>
<p>other semiconductor power switches, and it converts electrical energy of AC
</p>
<p>voltages and currents to electrical energy of DC voltages and currents. It is supplied
</p>

the converter intended
</p>
<p>for supplying the armature

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>either from a single-phase or from a three-phase network. At the input of a rectifier,
</p>
<p>there are AC voltages and currents. Mains-supplied rectifier has the AC quantities
</p>
<p>at the line frequency (50 or 60 Hz). The rectifier performs AC/DC conversion and
</p>
<p>feeds the electrical energy in the form of DC voltages and currents. A diode rectifier
</p>
<p>provides the output DC voltage E which is proportional to the rms value of the AC
</p>
<p>voltages across the input terminals. Therefore, mains-supplied diode rectifiers
</p>
<p>cannot provide variable DC voltage E.
</p>
<p>Receiving the energy from the DC supply E, it is necessary to perform the
</p>
<p>conversion and provide variable armature voltage of both polarities, positive and
</p>
<p>negative. Solution which satisfies the needs is the bridge comprising four switches,
</p>
<p>S1, S2, S3, and S4. Within these preliminary considerations, the switches are
</p>
<p>considered to be ideal. This means that they do not carry any electrical current
</p>
<p>when turned OFF (open). At the same time, the voltage drop across the switch
</p>
<p>which is turned ON (closed) is considered negligible and equal to zero. This means
</p>
<p>that any switch in the state of conduction (closed) does not have any conduction
</p>
<p>losses. Moreover, it is also assumed that the processes of closing and opening
</p>
<p>the switch do not involve any losses. Hence, there are no commutation losses. The
</p>
<p>transients of changing the switch state are called commutation.
</p>
<p>12.13.3.1 Power Switches
</p>
<p>Real mechanical switches as well as semiconductor power switches carry a small
</p>
<p>amount of leakage current even when switched OFF. Besides, in their state of
</p>
<p>conduction (ON, closed), they have a small voltage drop across the switch. Hence,
</p>
<p>real switches do have a certain amount of conduction losses. Each process of
</p>
<p>turning ON or OFF a semiconductor power switch and each process of closing or
</p>
<p>opening a mechanical switch involve energy losses. The energy loss incurred in
</p>
<p>each commutation is multiplied by the number of commutations per second to
</p>
<p>obtain the commutation losses.
</p>
<p>Mechanical switches have contacts which close (get in touch) or open (get
</p>
<p>detached) in order to operate the switch. Turn-OFF commutation losses in mechan-
</p>
<p>ical switches arise due to an intermittent electrical arc which appears during
</p>
<p>separation of contacts. Even though the contacts are being detached, the current
</p>
<p>continues for a short while through an electric arc which breaks up in the space
</p>
<p>between contacts. The contacts are disengaged quickly, and the arc is very brief.
</p>
<p>Yet, it contributes to energy losses. Turn-ON commutation losses of mechanical
</p>
<p>switches arise due to electrical current being established prior to proper closing of
</p>
<p>the contacts, which contributes to the commutation losses.
</p>
<p>Contemporary static power converters feeding the armature winding do not use
</p>
<p>mechanical switches. Instead, semiconductor power switches are used, such as BJT
</p>
<p>(bipolar junction transistors), MOSFET (metal oxide field effect transistors), and
</p>
<p>IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistors). In semiconductor power switches, com-
</p>
<p>mutation losses arise due to phenomena of a different nature. Due to transient
</p>
<p>processes within semiconductor power switches, the change from the OFF state,
</p>
<p>326 12 Modeling and Supplying DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>characterized by u &frac14; E and i � 0, into the ON state, characterized by u � 0 and
i &frac14; Ia, a brief commutation interval Dtc exists where considerable voltage and
considerable current exist at the same time. Commutation time Dtc is different for
</p>
<p>BJT, MOSFET, and IGBT transistors, and it ranges from 100 ns up to 1 ms. The time
</p>
<p>integral of the ui product during the commutation interval represents the energy loss
</p>
<p>incurred during one commutation event. In both cases of mechanical and semicon-
</p>
<p>ductor switches, power of commutation losses is dependent on the energy loss of
</p>
<p>single commutation and on the number of commutations per second.
</p>
<p>By closing switches S1 and S4, the voltage +E is established between brushes A
</p>
<p>and B. By closing switches S2 and S3, the voltage�E is established between brushes
A and B. Therefore, the switching bridge shown in Fig. 12.12 provides voltages of
</p>
<p>both polarities. Current through the closed switches is equal to the armature current.
</p>
<p>As the armature current has both directions, the switches should be capable of
</p>
<p>conducting the current in both directions. According to previous considerations, the
</p>
<p>voltage and current direction depend on the quadrant where the operating point of
</p>
<p>the machine resides.
</p>
<p>12.13.3.2 Switching States
</p>
<p>Each of the four switches is closed (ON) or opened (OFF). Assuming that all the
</p>
<p>switches can be controlled independently, the number of switching states for
</p>
<p>the four switches is 24 &frac14; 16. When the switches are connected to the switching
bridge, shown in Fig. 12.12, the number of available switching states is reduced.
</p>
<p>Considering switches S1 and S2, the switching state S1 &frac14; S2 &frac14; ON would bring
the power sourceE into short circuit. At the same time, the switching state S1 &frac14; S2 &frac14;
OFF would leave no path for the armature current and cannot be used either. Hence,
</p>
<p>the branch (arm) S1&ndash;S2 has only two available switching states, and these are
</p>
<p>(S1 &frac14; ON, S2 &frac14; OFF) and (S1 &frac14; OFF, S2 &frac14; ON). The same holds for branch
S3&ndash;S4. With two branches (arms) and with two possible switching states in each
</p>
<p>branch, the number of distinct switching states for the entire switching bridge is four.
</p>
<p>The same conclusion regarding the number of possible switching states can be
</p>
<p>obtained by reasoning whether the number of switches being turned ON at any
</p>
<p>given instant should be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Considering the switching bridge in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.12, it has to be noted that the number of switches is turned ON 2 at each
</p>
<p>instant. First of all, it can be neither 4 nor 3. If the number of turned-ON switches is
</p>
<p>3, then either the branch S1&ndash;S2 or the branch S3&ndash;S4 would bring the source E into
</p>
<p>short circuit. The source E is either a battery or a diode rectifier, and it has a very
</p>
<p>small internal resistance. Therefore, turning ON of one entire branch would lead to
</p>
<p>very high current through the source and through the switches, leading very quickly
</p>
<p>to their permanent damage. On the other hand, the number of turned-ON switches
</p>
<p>cannot be less than 2. This is due to the fact that the switching bridge must provide
</p>

<p>providing the path for the armature current, it is necessary that one of the switches
</p>
<p>in branch S1&ndash;S2 and one of the switches in branch S3&ndash;S4 gets turned ON. The last
</p>
<p>statement confirms the hypothesis that the number of switches turned ON at each
</p>
<p>instant is 1 in each branch (arm) and 2 in the switching bridge as a whole.
</p>
<p>Available switching states for the bridge in Fig. 12.12 are given in Table 12.1.

<p>For each of the four switches, notation 0 represents the OFF state, while notation 1
</p>
<p>represents the ON state. The column on the right-hand side shows voltage ui

</p>
<p>The switching bridge shown in Fig. 12.12 makes use of semiconductor power
</p>
<p>switches. They are mostly power transistors applying BJT, MOSFET, or IGBT
</p>
<p>technology. The type of transistor to be used in static converter depends upon the
</p>
<p>operating voltage, operating current, commutation frequency, cooling conditions,
</p>
<p>required reliability, price, and also upon other factors. Each of transistor technologies
</p>
<p>has its advantages, disadvantages, and characteristic application area. The most
</p>
<p>frequently used notation for the mentioned transistors is given in Fig. 12.13.

<p>The outline of most salient features of contemporary semiconductor power switches
</p>
<p>is included so that the reader may have an overview of practical voltage drops,
</p>
<p>commutation characteristics, and switch control requirements. Further study of
</p>
<p>power electronics is out of the scope of this book.
</p>
<p>The state of power transistors is controlled by the third, control electrode. In BJT
</p>
<p>transistor, control electrode is called base. Positive base current brings the BJT
</p>
<p>power transistor in ON state, while ceasing the base current and exposing the base
</p>
<p>to negative voltage turns the transistor OFF. Switching of IGBT and MOSFET
</p>
<p>transistors is accomplished by varying the voltage of the control electrode called

<p>gates. The gate voltage of +15 V is larger than the threshold VT &isin; [+4 V .. +6 V],
</p>
<p>and it brings the transistor into conduction state (ON). Turning OFF is achieved by
</p>
<p>applying�15 V to the gate. Supplying the base current to large BJT transistors may
involve considerable amount of power, while the gate control of IGBT and
</p>
<p>MOSFET transistors is virtually lossless.
</p>
<p>All the three families of power transistors have very small currents while in OFF
</p>
<p>state. Their ON behavior is different. The voltage drop across power transistor in the
</p>
<p>state of conduction (ON) is rather small. Roughly, it varies between 100mV and 3V.
</p>
<p>Bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is turned ON by feeding the base which is suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently high current to bring the transistor to the state of saturation, when the voltage
</p>
<p>VCE &frac14; VBE � VBC across collector and emitter terminals is very small. Small BJT
transistors in the state of saturation may have VCE as low as 200 mV. Power BJT
</p>
<p>transistors have their internal voltage drops and may have the values of VCE
anywhere between 500mV and 1V. On the other hand, large-current BJT transistors
</p>
<p>have relatively low current gain b &frac14; IC/IB and require very large base current. For
that reason, most semiconductor power switches in BJT technology have two
</p>
<p>transistors connected in Darlington configuration where the voltage drop in ON
</p>
<p>state is VCE &frac14; 2VBE � VBC, ranging between 1.5 and 3 V.
The MOSFET and IGBT transistors are turned ON by applying +15 V to the
</p>
<p>gate. MOSFET transistors in ON state behave as a resistor and have voltage drop of
</p>
<p>RONIDS, where RON is the &ldquo;ON&rdquo; of the MOSFET channel. Transistors made for
</p>
<p>operating voltages below 100 V may have RON of only 1 mO, resulting in very low
</p>
<p>voltage drops. Therefore, these transistors are preferred choice for all applications
</p>
<p>with low operating voltages. Due to specific properties of power MOSFET
</p>
<p>switches, their resistance RON increases with the maximum sustainable voltages.
</p>
<p>Due to RON ~ U
2.5, transistor made to sustain twice the voltage would have 5.6 time
</p>
<p>larger resistance in ON state. For that reason, high-voltage MOSFET transistors are
</p>
<p>rarely used due to their large voltage drop. IGBT power transistors are developed as
</p>
<p>a hybrid of BJT and MOSFET technologies, combining positive characteristics of
</p>
<p>the both. Therefore, they are widely used and made available for voltages up to
</p>
<p>several kilovolts and currents above 1 kA.
</p>
<p>12.13.3.4 Freewheeling Diodes
</p>
<p>Electrical current in armature winding changes direction to provide both motoring
</p>
<p>and braking torques. Therefore, each of the switches has to be ready to conduct
</p>
<p>electrical currents in both directions. Power switches in Fig. 12.13 are mostly made
</p>
<p>with power transistors. Placing one power transistor in place of the switches S1, S2,
</p>
<p>S3, and S4 is not sufficient since power transistors operate with only one direction of
</p>
<p>current. When turned ON, bipolar transistor conducts the current that enters collec-
</p>
<p>tor and goes to emitter. An attempt to establish emitter current of opposite direction
</p>
<p>is of little use. Power transistors are suited for bidirectional currents. Any inverse
</p>
<p>current may result in significant losses and eventually damage semiconductor
</p>
<p>device. Therefore, the use of transistors with inverse current is not of interest in
</p>
<p>12.13 Topologies of DC Machine Power Supplies 329</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>static power converters. Transistors such as BJT, IGBT, and MOSFET are used to
</p>
<p>conduct electrical current only in one direction. For this reason, each of the switches
</p>
<p>S1.. S4 has one power transistor and one semiconductor power diode. Element
</p>
<p>denoted by (C) in Fig. 12.13 is a parallel connection of one bipolar transistor
</p>
<p>conducting in CE direction and one power diode conducting in EC direction. All
</p>
<p>the four switches shown in Fig. 12.12 are constructed in the prescribed way.
</p>
<p>Therefore, each of S1.. S4 switches should be considered as a parallel connection
</p>
<p>of one power transistor and one power diode.
</p>
<p>12.13.3.5 Available Output Voltages
</p>
<p>According to Table 12.1, a positive voltage across the armature winding is obtained
</p>
<p>by turning ON the switches S1 and S4. In this switching state, positive armature
</p>
<p>current circulates through power transistors within switches S1 and S4. Otherwise,
</p>
<p>with negative armature current, the current is established through power diodes
</p>
<p>within switches S1 and S4, connected in parallel with power transistors. Negative
</p>
<p>voltage across the armature winding is obtained by turning ON the switches S2 and
</p>
<p>S3. The same way as the previous, this switching state can be used for armature
</p>
<p>currents in both directions. There are also the switching states S1 &frac14; S3 &frac14; ON and
S2 &frac14; S4 &frac14; ON which provide the armature voltage ui &frac14; 0.
</p>
<p>The switching structure in Fig. 12.12 with four available switching states allows
</p>
<p>feeding the armature winding by voltages and currents of both polarities. Therefore,
</p>
<p>it is compatible with the need to operate DC machine in all the four quadrants in
</p>
<p>Tem&ndash;Om plane. Prescribed method cannot provide continuous change in armature
</p>
<p>voltage. Namely, there are only four available switching states, and they provide the
</p>
<p>output voltages of +E, �E, or 0. Hence, the armature winding can be supplied by
the voltage that assumes one of the three discrete values. Instantaneous value of
</p>
<p>the armature voltage cannot have a continuous change. On the other hand, the
</p>
<p>armature voltage can be supplied by the train of pulses. The change (modulation) of
</p>
<p>the pulse-width changes the average value of the armature voltage.
</p>
<p>Question (12.7): What are the switching states that provide armature voltage equal
to zero?
</p>
<p>Answer (12.7): By turning ON switches S2 and S4, armature voltage is made equal
to zero. Armature winding is short circuited also when switches S1 and S3 are
</p>
<p>switched ON.
</p>
<p>12.13.4 Pulse-Width Modulation
</p>
<p>According to analysis summarized in Table 12.1, the output voltage ui may have
</p>
<p>one of the three available values, +E, �E, or 0. It has been shown that application
of DC electrical motors requires continuous variation of the supply voltage.
</p>
<p>330 12 Modeling and Supplying DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The switching structure in Fig. 12.12 cannot produce continuous change of the
</p>
<p>output voltage. On the other hand, it is possible to devise a sequence of switching
</p>
<p>states that would repeat in relatively short periods called switching periods. Each
</p>
<p>switching state may have adjustable duration and provide the armature voltages +E,
</p>
<p>�E, or 0. Sequential repetition of discrete voltages +E,�E, and/or 0 would result in
an average voltage +E &gt; Uav &gt; �E. The voltage ui would assume the form of a
train of pulses of variable width. The width of the pulses would affect the average
</p>
<p>voltage Uav within each switching period. It is obvious, though, that variation of
</p>
<p>pulse width cannot result in continuous change of the instantaneous voltage. It is
</p>
<p>possible to change only the average value of the armature voltage within each
</p>
<p>switching period. Variation of pulse width is called pulse-width modulation.
</p>
<p>12.13.4.1 Armature Voltage Requirements
</p>
<p>In the areas of industrial robots, electrical vehicles, and in majority of applications
</p>
<p>involving motion control, there is a need for continuous variation of the speed of
</p>
<p>electrical motors. The steady-state armature voltage is equal to Ua &frac14; RaIa &thorn;
keFfOm. The voltage drop RaIa is usually much lower than the electromotive
</p>
<p>force. Windings of electrical machines are made to have small resistance, so as to
</p>
<p>reduce losses due to Joule effect and increase the efficiency. Therefore, it is justified
</p>
<p>to assume that Ua � keFfOm. With constant flux, the armature voltage is propor-
tional to the rotor speed. As the speed changes continuously, the voltage must have
</p>
<p>continuous changes as well. The available voltage sources are usually batteries or
</p>
<p>diode rectifiers with constant voltage E. There is a possibility to use a series
</p>
<p>resistance DR in the armature circuit and to reduce the voltage by DRIa. The
</p>
<p>rheostat approach to the voltage regulation allows the voltage Ua &frac14; E � DRIa to
be changes varying resistor DR. This regulation is not convenient as it has poor
</p>
<p>energy efficiency. It is accompanied by the losses due to Joule effect in the resistor.
</p>
<p>In cases where Ua &frac14; &frac12;E is required, one half of the input power is converted into
heat in series resistor DR, while the other half is transferred to DC machine.
</p>
<p>12.13.4.2 Pulse-Width Modulation
</p>
<p>Electrical machines are supplied by variable voltage from switching power supplies.
</p>
<p>An example of power supply based on switching bridge is shown in Fig. 12.12.
</p>
<p>It does not contain series resistors or similar elements which would bring in power
</p>
<p>losses. Neglecting rather small conduction and commutation losses incurred in
</p>
<p>power switches, the switching bridge in Fig. 12.12 is virtually lossless. According
</p>
<p>to Table 12.1, the switching state (S1 &frac14; S4 &frac14; ON and S2 &frac14; S3 &frac14; OFF) provides the
armature voltage Ua &frac14; +E, where E is DC voltage fed to the input terminals of
the switching bridge. The source E is often called primary source. If the switching
</p>
<p>12.13 Topologies of DC Machine Power Supplies 331</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>state is changed and the other diagonal is activated where (S1 &frac14; S4 &frac14; OFF and
S2 &frac14; S3 &frac14; ON), the armature voltage becomes Ua &frac14; �E. None of the two3 consid-
ered states allows continuous voltage variations. However, by fast, periodic change
</p>
<p>of switching states, the output voltage resembles a train of pulses. The width of such
</p>
<p>voltage pulses can be altered by changing the dwell time of corresponding switching
</p>
<p>states. The average voltage of the pulse train depends on the amplitude and width of
</p>
<p>individual pulses. By a continuous variation of the pulse width, it is possible to
</p>
<p>accomplish a continuous variation of the average voltage.
</p>
<p>12.13.4.3 Average Voltage
</p>
<p>If the armature voltage obtained at the output of the switching bridge changes
</p>
<p>periodically, intervals with S1 &frac14; S4 &frac14; ON are replaced by intervals when S2 &frac14; S3
&frac14; ON. Within one switching period T, the switching bridge assumes the first
switching state and then changes to the second switching state. The switching
</p>
<p>period is usually close to 100 ms. During one period, the switching state with
</p>
<p>diagonal S1&ndash;S4 turned ON is retained over the interval tON, where 0 &lt; tON &lt; T.
During the remaining part of the period, diagonal S2&ndash;S3 is turned ON. The form of
</p>
<p>the output voltage obtained across the armature winding is shown in Fig. 12.14. The
</p>
<p>average voltage within the period T is proportional to the pulse width tON:

</p>
<p>Fig. 12.14 Pulse-width modulation
</p>
<p>3There are two more switching states that provide Ua &frac14; 0. One of them is (S1 &frac14; S3 &frac14; ON and
S2 &frac14; S4 &frac14; OFF), while the other is (S2 &frac14; S4 &frac14; ON and S1 &frac14; S3 &frac14; OFF). They are not consid-
ered in further discussion, so as to keep the introduction to pulse-width modulation principles as
</p>
<p>simple as possible. It has to be noticed, though, that there exist practical reasons to use these zero-
</p>
<p>voltage states in practical implementation.
</p>
<p>332 12 Modeling and Supplying DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>By continuous variation of the pulse width over the range 0 &lt; tON &lt; T, the
average value of the output voltage varies from &ndash;E to +E. Since Ua � keFfOm,
variation of the pulse width tON can be used to change the rotor speed within the
</p>
<p>range �E/(keFf) up to +E/(keFf). Variation of the pulse width is called pulse-width
modulation (PWM). Switching bridge in Fig. 12.14 plays the role of a power
</p>
<p>amplifier whose operation is controlled by the variable tON. It provides the output
</p>
<p>voltage uiwith an average value determined by the pulse width tON. Whenever there
</p>
<p>is a need to make a continuous change of the armature voltage, this can be accom-
</p>
<p>plished by changing the pulse width tON in a continuous manner. The switching
</p>
<p>bridge allows variation of the voltage with almost no losses.
</p>
<p>12.13.4.4 AC Components of the Output Voltage
</p>
<p>In addition to the average value, the armature voltage depicted in Fig. 12.15 also has
</p>
<p>an AC component. The voltage shape is periodic, and it contains a number of
</p>
<p>harmonic components. The basic frequency component, that is, the one with the
</p>
<p>lowest frequency, has the period T and frequency f &frac14; 1/T. The period T is the time
interval comprising one positive voltage pulse and one negative voltage pulse.
</p>
<p>Repetition of such periods makes the pulse train providing the output voltage.
</p>
<p>Frequency f can be close to 10 kHz.
</p>
<p>DC machines require the armature voltage that can change continuously. The
</p>
<p>instantaneous value of the armature voltage does not satisfy this requirement, as it
</p>
<p>takes one of the two discrete values, either +E or�E. The voltage fed to the brushes
is pulse-shaped voltage which, in addition to the average value, comprises parasitic
</p>
<p>AC components. It is necessary to envisage the consequences of such AC
</p>
<p>components of the voltage and analyze whether the switching bridge is a suitable
</p>
<p>power supply for electrical machines. If the AC component of the supply voltage
</p>
<p>does not have any significant effect on the armature current, electromagnetic
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>torque, and the rotor speed, and it does not contribute to losses, then the operation of
</p>
<p>an electrical machine supplied by the pulse-shaped voltage corresponds to
</p>
<p>the operation of the same machine fed from an ideal voltage source providing the
</p>
<p>voltage ua(t) &frac14; (2tON � T)E/T which is pulse-free and does not have any AC
components.
</p>
<p>12.13.4.5 Low-Pass Nature of Electrical Machines
</p>
<p>The windings of electrical machines have certain inductance, determined by the
</p>
<p>number of turns and the magnetic resistance. Impedance of the winding to electrical
</p>
<p>currents of the angular frequency o is X &frac14; Lo. In cases where an AC voltage is fed
to the winding, the amplitude of AC electrical currents caused by such voltage
</p>
<p>decreases at elevated angular frequencies o. Therefore, at very large frequencies,
</p>
<p>the impact of AC voltages on armature current is negligible.
</p>
<p>Differential equation ua(t) &frac14; Raia(t) + Ladia(t)/dt + Ea describes transient pro-
cesses in the armature winding. Laplace transform can be applied to obtain the
</p>
<p>equation Ua(s) &frac14; RaIa(s) + sLaIa(s) + Ea(s) with complex images of voltages and
currents. The armature current is obtained as Ia(s) &frac14; (Ua(s) � Ea(s))/(Ra + sLa).
The function W(s) &frac14; 1/(Ra + sLa) represents transfer function of the armature
winding, and it describes the response of the armature current to changes in the
</p>
<p>armature voltage. The transfer function is obtained by dividing the complex images
</p>
<p>of relevant currents and voltages. Since the armature voltage is the cause while the
</p>
<p>armature current change is the consequence, the voltage is considered an input and
</p>
<p>the current an output. The function W(s) is used to establish the response of
</p>
<p>armature current to the excitation by armature voltage, wherein the latter comprises
</p>
<p>certain harmonic components. The ratio of currents I(jo) and voltagesU(jo) having
</p>
<p>certain angular frequency o &frac14; 2p/T is obtained by replacing s &frac14; jo in W(s):
</p>
<p>I jo&eth; &THORN;
U jo&eth; &THORN; &frac14; W jo&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>Ra &thorn; joLa
� 1
</p>
<p>joLa
: (12.20)
</p>
<p>At frequencies of the order of several kHz, it is justified to assume that Ra �
oLa; thus, the ratio of AC components of currents and voltages is determined as
</p>
<p>1/(Lao). Therefore, the voltage components at higher frequencies produce corres-
</p>
<p>ponding components of the armature current with rather small amplitude. At
</p>
<p>frequencies of the order of 10 kHz, reactance Lao is so high that the response of
</p>
<p>the armature current is negligible. Therefore, the pulsating nature of the supply
</p>
<p>voltage has no significant effect on the armature current. Therefore, for all practical
</p>
<p>uses, the presence of AC components in the armature voltage can be neglected.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the analysis of operation of DC machines fed from PWM-controlled
</p>
<p>switching bridge supplies can be simplified by modeling the switching bridge in a
</p>
<p>way that omits the high-frequency AC components. If the switching frequency
</p>
<p>f &frac14; 1/T is sufficiently high, the switching supply shown in Fig. 12.12 can be
</p>

</p>
<p>from AC components. By varying the pulse width tON, the voltage of such source is
</p>
<p>changed according to the law Uav &frac14; (2tON � T)E/T.
</p>
<p>12.13.5 Current Ripple
</p>
<p>In the preceding subsection, it is shown that, at sufficiently high frequencies f &frac14; 1/T,
it is justifiable to neglect the AC component of the train of voltage pulses fed to the
</p>
<p>armature winding. In this section, the changes of the armature current and voltage
</p>
<p>are analyzed by taking into account the high-frequency aspects. Moreover, electrical
</p>
<p>current of the primary source supplying the switching bridge is analyzed as well.
</p>
<p>In Fig. 12.12, the current of the source E is denoted by iu. These quantities are shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 12.16.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The voltage drop due to resistance Ra of the armature winding is neglected; thus,
</p>
<p>the current change is determined by the ratio of difference (ua � Ea) and induc-
tance La. In cases where the electromotive force Ea is equal to the supply voltage,
</p>
<p>there is no change of current. If these conditions persist, the system enters the steady
</p>
<p>state. When the armature winding is fed from a switching power supply feeding the
</p>
<p>voltage pulses of variable pulse width, the instantaneous value of the armature
</p>
<p>voltage assumes one of the two distinct states, either +E or &ndash;E. The power supply
</p>
<p>voltage gets equal to the electromotive force Ea only in the exceptional cases where
</p>
<p>Ea &frac14; +E or Ea &frac14; �E. In majority of cases, the electromotive force is smaller than
the supply voltage:
</p>
<p>Eaj j&lt; Ej j:
</p>
<p>Within each period T, the armature voltage +E is greater than the electromotive
</p>
<p>force during the interval tON, where the first derivative of the current is positive and
</p>
<p>the current linearly increases in accordance with (12.21). When the interval tON
elapses, the armature voltage �E is smaller than the electromotive force, which
leads to a linear decrease of the current during the interval T � tON. Figure 12.15
shows the equivalent circuit which contains the pulsating voltage source ui, induc-
</p>
<p>tance La of the armature winding, and electromotive force of the armature winding.
</p>
<p>Resistance of the armature winding is neglected. It is assumed that the electro-
</p>
<p>motive force remains constant within switching period T. The amplitude of arma-
</p>
<p>ture current oscillations is denoted by DI, and it is called current ripple. During each
</p>
<p>voltage pulse, the change of the current is linear, as determined by (12.21). In order
</p>
<p>to determine the amplitude of these oscillations DI, one starts from instant t1, shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 12.15, when a positive voltage pulse commences. At this instant, the
</p>
<p>armature current is ia(t1) &frac14; Iav � DI. Over the interval [t1 .. t2], the output voltage
of the switching supply is equal to ui &frac14; +E, and the current ia increases with
the slope (E � Ea)/La. The current change is linear, and it reaches the value of
ia(t2) at instant t2 &frac14; t1 + tON, which marks the end of the positive voltage pulse:

<p>Prolonged operation in the prescribed way implies a constant width tON and a

<p>constant average value Iav of the armature current. Under circumstances, this
</p>
<p>operation can be characterized as the steady state, notwithstanding the fact that the
</p>
<p>current exhibits periodic oscillations DI. In such state, the instantaneous values of
</p>
<p>the armature current at the end of each negative pulse must be equal. Therefore, at

<p>On the basis of (12.19), the previous expression represents the average value of

<p>of Ra � 0, the steady state in armature circuit is reached when the average value of
the supply voltage is equal to the electromotive force Ea. This steady state is
</p>
<p>represented in Fig. 12.15. The armature current oscillates around an average
</p>
<p>value which is maintained constant. The amplitude of oscillations DI depends on
</p>
<p>the switching frequency, supply voltage, and armature inductance.
</p>
<p>The ratio of the positive pulse width and period tON/T is calledmodulation index,

<p>The analysis shows that steady state in the armature circuit is established when

<p>the electromotive force and modulation index satisfy condition (2 m � 1)E &frac14; Ea.
Then, the average value of current does not change between the successive
</p>
<p>switching periods. The instantaneous value of the current oscillates around its

<p>average value with the period T and amplitude DI given in expression (12.26).
</p>
<p>The operating frequency of the switching bridge f &frac14; 1/T &frac14; o/(2p) determines the
frequency of oscillations of the armature current. The frequency f and angular
</p>
<p>frequency o &frac14; 2pf are called commutation frequency and also switching fre-
quency. When commutation frequency is sufficiently high, the current ripple is
</p>
<p>very small. Then, it is justified to neglect the AC component of the pulse-width-
</p>
<p>modulated train of pulses and consider that machine is fed from an ideal power
</p>
<p>source feeding a variable voltage Uav &frac14; (2 m � 1)E, determined by the modula-
tion index and free from AC components.
</p>
<p>A close estimate of the ripple can be obtained by considering only the voltage
</p>
<p>and current components at the switching frequency f &frac14; 1/T. The ratio between
the AC current of frequency o &frac14; 2p/T and the voltage of the same frequency is
determined by the inductance of the armature winding. Namely, |I(jo)/U(jo)| �
1/(Lao). Considering the train of voltage pulses where the values +E and �E repeat
with period T and with duration of the positive pulse tON &frac14; T/2, the amplitude of
the harmonic component of the frequency f &frac14; 1/T is V1 &frac14; (4/p)E. Corresponding
harmonic component of the armature current has the amplitude of I1 &frac14; V1/(Lao)
&frac14; (4/p)E/(2pLaf) &frac14; (2/p2) E/(Laf) � 0.2026 E/(Laf). This approach neglects har-
monic components at higher frequencies and overlooks the fact that the considered
</p>
<p>voltage does not change as a sinusoidal function. Instead, it is a train of pulses
</p>
<p>which comprises harmonic component at the frequency f &frac14; 1/T, but it also has
harmonic components at frequencies that are odd multiples of f.
</p>
<p>A more accurate estimate of the current ripple can be obtained by using
</p>
<p>expression (12.26). Ripple DI has the maximum value with modulation index of
</p>
<p>m &frac14; 0.5. In this case, the ripple is

</p>
<p>: (12.27)
</p>
<p>When using the above results, one should take into account that the preceding
</p>
<p>analysis assumes that the switching bridge in Fig. 12.12 uses only two switching
</p>
<p>states: the state with diagonal S1-S4 turned ON and the state with diagonal S2&ndash;S3
turned ON. In Table 12.1, there are two more available states, S1 &frac14; S3 &frac14; ON and
S2 &frac14; S4 &frac14; ON, which both produce the output voltage of zero. Control of the
switching bridge can be organized by using additional two states and inserting
</p>
<p>the time intervals when the voltage is equal to zero. In this case, the relevant
</p>
<p>expressions for tON time change as well as the definition of the modulation index.
</p>
<p>In cases where DC machine requires a positive armature voltage, the train of
</p>
<p>voltage pulses is made by sequencing +E and 0, providing an average value
</p>
<p>between these two values. Whenever a negative armature voltage is needed, the
</p>
<p>train of voltage pulses is made by sequencing �E and 0. More detailed analysis of
the pulse-width modulation technique is not studied in this book.
</p>
<p>Input current taken from the source by the switching bridge is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.16, and it is denoted by iu. This current depends on the instantaneous
</p>
<p>value of armature current ia and on the switching state. If diagonal S1&ndash;S4 is ON,
</p>
<p>338 12 Modeling and Supplying DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>positive terminal of the source E is connected to brush A through the switch S1,
</p>
<p>while negative terminal of the source is connected to brush B through the switch S4.
</p>
<p>Therefore, in this switching state, iu &frac14; ia. If diagonal S2&ndash;S3 is ON, iu &frac14; �ia. As a
consequence, the input current of the switching bridge has the shape of a train of
</p>
<p>pulses with an amplitude determined by the armature current and with the sign
</p>
<p>determined by the switching state of the bridge.
</p>
<p>Question (12.8): Determine the change and the amplitude of oscillations of the
armature current in the case when DC motor is supplied from the voltage shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.26, with Ea &frac14; 0 and Ra &frac14; 0 and with known La, T, and E.
Answer (12.8): Since the average voltage has to match the electromotive force,
duration of the positive voltage pulse is tON &frac14; T/2. During the first half period,
Ladia/dt &frac14; &thorn; E. Therefore, the current change is linear. The same applies for
the second half period. The amplitude of oscillations of the armature current around
</p>
<p>its average value is DI. Within the first half period, the current increases from
</p>
<p>�DI to + DI. The change is linear, dia/dt &frac14; 2DI/(T/2) &frac14; E/La, and therefore,
DI &frac14; ET/(4La).
Question (12.9): Control of the switching bridge of Fig. 12.12 is carried out by
keeping switch S4 permanently closed and switch S3 permanently open. At the begin-
</p>
<p>ning of period T, the switch S1 is turned ON. After the on time tON &frac14; mT elapses, the
switch is turned OFF. In the remaining part of the period T � tON, the switch S2 is
turned ON. The switching bridge is supplied from a constant voltage source E.
</p>
<p>Determine the average value of the output voltage, and find the expression for the
</p>
<p>current ripple.
</p>
<p>Answer (12.9): The output voltage ui is a periodic train of pulses that repeat with
period T. In the first part of each period, during interval tON, the instantaneous value
</p>
<p>of the output voltage is +E. During the remaining part of the period T � tON,
switches S2 and S4 are turned ON and the output voltage is equal to zero. The average
</p>
<p>value of the voltage is Uav &frac14; [(tON)�E + (T � tON) �0]/T &frac14; (tON/T)E &frac14; mE. The
current ripple is determined by repeating the calculation included in the previous
</p>
<p>analysis, starting with (12.23) and ending with (12.26). Compared to the previous
</p>
<p>analysis, where the instantaneous values of the output voltagewere +E and�E, in this
example, they are +E and 0. With this in mind, the armature current ripple is

<p>12.13.6 Topologies of Power Converters
</p>
<p>DC machines are to be supplied by continuously variable DC voltage. The voltage
</p>
<p>should be suited for the desired operating mode of the machine. The switching
</p>
<p>bridge in Fig. 12.12 illustrates the principle of operation of static power converters
</p>
<p>which allow lossless conversion of DC voltages and currents. Practical static

<p>converter may have other parts that are not shown in Fig. 12.12. It has electronic
</p>
<p>circuits that control the state of the power switches, microprocessor-based control-
</p>
<p>ler, auxiliary power supplies for electronic circuits, diode rectifier which converts
</p>
<p>the AC mains into DC voltage E, protection devices, communication devices, and
</p>
<p>other auxiliary parts. Primary source of electrical energy for supplying electrical
</p>
<p>machines is usually low-voltage distribution network with line-frequency AC
</p>
<p>voltages. The line frequency of AC distribution networks is 50 Hz. Three-phase
</p>
<p>connections have line-to-line voltages of 400 V rms. Low-power converters can
</p>
<p>be supplied from single-phase connection with phase voltage of 220 V rms. The
</p>
<p>voltages of AC distribution network do not correspond to the needs of DC
</p>
<p>machines. Therefore, it is necessary to use static power converters. Their task is
</p>
<p>to convert the electrical energy of AC voltages and currents to electrical energy of
</p>
<p>DC voltages and currents to be fed to the armature winding and the excitation
</p>
<p>winding. It is necessary to provide continuous change of DC voltages fed to the
</p>
<p>windings. In some cases, the primary source of electrical energy is a battery, and it
</p>
<p>gives a constant DC voltage. This is the case in autonomous vehicles and autono-
</p>
<p>mous devices and systems that do not have connection to AC mains. Batteries
</p>
<p>provide constant DC voltages that cannot be adjusted to meet the needs of DC
</p>
<p>machines. In such cases, it is necessary to use static power converter that converts
</p>
<p>constant DC voltage of the battery to variable DC voltage to be fed to the armature
</p>
<p>winding. The latter is continuously changed according to the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, DC machines can receive electrical energy from primary
</p>
<p>sources which include batteries, single-phase AC supplies, and three-phase AC
</p>
<p>supplies but also other voltage and current systems and forms. Primary source
</p>
<p>voltages are rarely compatible with the machine needs and therefore should be
</p>
<p>adjusted. For this reason, it is necessary to use static power converter between the
</p>
<p>primary source connections and the terminals of electrical machine. The role of
</p>
<p>static power converter is to convert the voltages and currents of the primary source to
</p>
<p>the form and amplitude required by the actual operating mode of electrical machine.
</p>
<p>Figure 12.17 shows a simplified scheme of a switching power converter with
</p>
<p>transistors, intended for feeding and controlling DC machines. This converter is
</p>
<p>often met in practice. Part (D) shows a switching bridge comprising four power
</p>
<p>transistors. The bridge is entirely the same as the one shown in Fig. 12.12 and
</p>
<p>analyzed previously. Each IGBT transistor has a diode in parallel, called freewheel-
</p>
<p>ing diode, aimed to conduct the switch currents in direction from emitter to
</p>
<p>collector. Diode rectifier, shown in part (A) of Fig. 12.17, converts three-phase
</p>
<p>system of AC voltages, provided from the mains, into DC voltage E. Part (B) of
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.17 contains a series inductance and parallel capacitor used for filtering the
</p>
<p>rectifier output voltage. This part of static power converter is called intermediate
</p>
<p>DC circuit or DC link. The voltage of the intermediate DC circuit is constant, and it
</p>
<p>represents the input voltage to the switching bridge, previously denoted by E.
</p>
<p>Part (C) contains an additional transistor switch which, as required, may be
</p>
<p>turned ON and thus connects a resistor in parallel to the capacitor. By turning ON
</p>
<p>this fifth transistor, DC link voltage appears across the resistor. The resistor current
</p>
<p>acts toward reducing the DC link voltage and converting a certain amount of energy
</p>
<p>340 12 Modeling and Supplying DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>into heat. This may be required when DC machine operates in the second or fourth
</p>
<p>quadrant, namely, when the torque and speed have opposite directions and the
</p>
<p>machine operates as a generator. In generator mode, the armature winding does not
</p>
<p>consume the electrical energy. Instead, it acts as a source and passes the energy
</p>
<p>back toward the switching bridge. In other words, the power flow changes and, in
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.17, it goes from the right to the left.
</p>
<p>In even quadrants, DC machine breaks and converts mechanical work into
</p>
<p>electrical energy. The energy obtained in this way is called braking energy, since
</p>
<p>it is obtained by deducting mechanical work and/or kinetic energy from the mechan-
</p>
<p>ical subsystem. Direction of the current in the circuit is reversed, and the switching
</p>
<p>bridge does not take the energy from the intermediate DC circuit anymore. Instead, it
</p>
<p>delivers power and supplies the current to the elements of the intermediate DC
</p>
<p>circuit. Due to the sign change of the average value of the current iu, this current is
</p>
<p>directed from the switching bridge to the DC link capacitor. Therefore, the voltage
</p>
<p>across DC link capacitor increases. The obtained energy cannot be returned to the
</p>
<p>AC mains. For this to achieve, direction of the rectifier current should be changed.
</p>
<p>Semiconductor diodes of the three-phase rectifier (A in Fig. 12.17) conduct the
</p>
<p>current from anode to cathode and cannot have the currents in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>Hence, the braking energy cannot return to the mains and remains in DC link circuit.
</p>
<p>The excess energy is accumulated in the capacitor, increasing its energy to
</p>
<p>WC &frac14; &frac12;CE2. Excessive increase of E may damage circuit elements. Therefore,
the process of accumulation of the braking energy has to be stopped. By turning the
</p>
<p>fifth transistor ON (C), a high-power resistor is connected in parallel to the interme-
</p>
<p>diate DC link circuit, and the excess of the braking energy is dissipated in the
</p>
<p>resistor. The elements used in the process are called braking device or dynamic
</p>
<p>braking device. In Fig. 12.17, dynamic braking device is denoted by (C).
</p>
<p>Static power converters with power transistors have advantageous characteristics
</p>
<p>compared to other solutions. Therefore, they are widely used. Their use is limited

<p>only by the voltage and current rating of the available power transistors. At present,
</p>
<p>commercially available transistors cover the voltages up to 6 kV and currents up to
</p>
<p>2&ndash;3 kA. Practical switching power converters with power transistors reach the
</p>
<p>power levels in excess of 1 MW, covering virtually all practical applications of
</p>
<p>DC machines.
</p>
<p>A couple of decades ago, at the end of the twentieth century, power transistor
</p>
<p>technology was sufficient for building switching power converters up to of several
</p>
<p>tens of kilowatts. At that time, there were no power transistors with sufficient
</p>
<p>voltage and current ratings to cover larger powers. In order to build large power
</p>
<p>static power converters, thyristors were used, four-layer semiconductor devices
</p>
<p>invented and put to practical use years before power transistors. Now and then,
</p>
<p>the voltage and current ratings of available thyristors exceed greatly the ratings of
</p>
<p>available power transistors. Yet, designing static power converters with thyristors is
</p>
<p>not an easy task. While power transistors can be turned ON or OFF at will,
</p>
<p>thyristors behave differently. They can be turned ON by gate pulses, but they
</p>
<p>cannot be turned OFF4 unless the anode-to-cathode current does not return to
</p>
<p>zero. For those reasons, electrical schematics of thyristor-based static power
</p>
<p>converters do not resemble the ones with power transistors.
</p>
<p>Characteristic topologies of thyristor converters for supplying large DC
</p>
<p>machines are shown in Fig. 12.18. Although the thyristor topologies are primarily
</p>
<p>of historical significance, one can encounter previously installed systems based on
</p>
<p>thyristor converters in industrial and other applications requiring controlled DC
</p>
<p>machines of large power.
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.18 Topology of converters with thyristors: Single phase supplied (left) and three phase

<p>4Thyristors have three electrodes. Their anode and cathode conduct the switch current, while the
</p>
<p>third electrode, the gate, serves as the control electrode. A small positive pulse of gate current turns

<p>ON the thyristor, provided that uAK &gt; 0. Conventional thyristor cannot be turned OFF by
operating the gate. There are gate turn-OFF thyristors made in such way that a very large spike
</p>
<p>of negative gate current may result in turn OFF. Yet, their use and the associated auxiliary circuits
</p>
<p>are rather involved. Therefore, their use is rather limited.

<p>Characteristics of DC Machines
</p>
<p>WorkingwithDCmachines requires the knowledge on their electrical andmechanical
</p>
<p>properties, parameters, and limitations. This chapter introduces and explains the
</p>
<p>concept of rated quantities and discusses the maximum permissible currents in
</p>
<p>continuous, steady-state service of DC machines. It also defines the safe operating
</p>
<p>area of DC machines in Tem&ndash;Om plane, both in steady-state operation and during
</p>
<p>transients. For the sake of readers that meet electrical machines for the first time,
</p>
<p>the concepts of rated1 current, rated voltage, mechanical characteristics, natural
</p>
<p>characteristics, rated speed, rated torque, and rated power are introduced and
</p>
<p>explained in this chapter. The need to use machines at higher speeds and with reduced
</p>
<p>flux is discussed and explained, introducing at the same time the constant flux
</p>
<p>operating region and the field-weakening operating region. The problems of removing
</p>
<p>the heat caused by the conversion losses are analyzed along with the performance
</p>
<p>restrictions imposed by temperature limits. Besides, an insight is given into possible
</p>
<p>short-term overload operation of DC machines. Principal conversion losses in DC
</p>
<p>machines are analyzed, discussed, and included in power balance. This chapter closes
</p>
<p>by discussing permissible operating areas in torque-speed plane. The steady-state safe
</p>
<p>operating area in Tem&ndash;Om plane is also called exploitation characteristics. It is
</p>
<p>introduced and explained along with the transient safe operating area, also called the
</p>
<p>transient characteristic. Discussion and examples within this chapter are focused on
</p>
<p>separately excited DC machines.
</p>
<p>1 In electrical engineering, the concept of rated voltages, currents, and other similar quantities is
</p>
<p>widely used. Considered quantities are usually the ones that contribute to thermal, mechanical,
</p>
<p>dielectric, or other stress that may have potential of damaging electrical machine, transformer, or
</p>
<p>other electrical device or to increase its ware and reduce the expected lifetime. The rated value is
</p>
<p>most usually set by the manufacturer as a maximum value to be used with the considered device.
</p>
<p>Continued operation with voltages and currents that exceed the rated values causes permanent
</p>
<p>damage to machine windings, magnetic circuits, or other vital parts. For some quantities such as
</p>
<p>electrical current, the rated value can be surpassed during very short intervals of time without
</p>
<p>causing damages. The rated values are usually set somewhat below the level that damages the
</p>
<p>device. This is done to allow a certain safety margin.

<p>13.1 Rated Voltage
</p>
<p>The winding rated voltage is the highest voltage that can be permanently applied to
</p>
<p>the winding terminals without causing breakdown or accelerated aging of electrical
</p>
<p>insulation. In some cases, the rated voltage can be briefly exceeded without causing
</p>
<p>any harm.
</p>
<p>Electrical insulation separates the winding conductor from the walls of the slot
</p>
<p>where the conductor is placed. In addition, the electrical insulation separates this
</p>
<p>conductor from other conductors. A loss of insulation leads to a short circuit
</p>
<p>between individual conductors, between the winding terminals, as well as between
</p>
<p>the winding and the magnetic circuit or the machine housing. Each of the accidents
</p>
<p>mentioned results in permanent damage and interrupts the operation of the
</p>
<p>machine. In most cases, it has to be sent to the workshop or repair service.
</p>
<p>The electrical field which exists in insulation is proportional to the supply
</p>
<p>voltage. The insulation is characterized by the rated voltage Un as well as by the
</p>
<p>breakdown voltage Umax.
</p>
<p>The breakdown voltage causes instantaneous damage of insulation. With break-
</p>
<p>down voltage applied, the electrical field strength in critical parts of the insulation
</p>
<p>material exceeds the dielectric strength of the material and destroys insulation.
</p>
<p>Cumulative ionization of otherwise nonconductive dielectric provides a virtual
</p>
<p>short circuit between two conductors, or between the winding terminals, or a short
</p>
<p>circuit between the winding and earthed metal parts of the machine.
</p>
<p>The rated voltage is lower than the breakdown voltage. Supplying the winding
</p>
<p>with a voltage which is higher than the rated but lower than the breakdown voltage
</p>
<p>does not necessarily lead to breakdown. Increased electrical field strength
</p>
<p>established with voltages above the rated lead to accelerated degradation and
</p>
<p>aging of the insulation material. This phenomenon reduces the expected lifetime
</p>
<p>of the insulation. Insulation aging is related to electrical, chemical, and thermal
</p>
<p>processes within dielectric materials. In most cases where the voltage is maintained
</p>
<p>within the limits of the rated voltage, expected lifetime of insulation materials and
</p>
<p>systems reaches 20 years. Continued operation with voltages exceeding the rated by
</p>
<p>8% may halve the insulation lifetime.
</p>
<p>13.2 Mechanical Characteristic
</p>
<p>Mechanical characteristic is function T(O) orO(T) which gives relation between the
</p>
<p>angular speed of rotation and electromagnetic torque in steady-state operating

<p>13.3 Natural Characteristic
</p>
<p>Natural characteristic is mechanical characteristic obtained in the case when all the
</p>
<p>voltages fed to the machine are equal to the rated voltages.
</p>
<p>13.4 Rated Current
</p>
<p>Rated current In is the maximum permissible armature current in continuous
</p>
<p>operation. Namely, it is the largest current that can be maintained permanently,
</p>
<p>which at the same time does not cause any overheating, damages, faults, or
</p>
<p>accelerated aging. In AC machines, the rated current implies the rms value of the
</p>
<p>winding current.
</p>
<p>Electrical currents in windings of electrical machine produce losses and develop
</p>
<p>heat, increasing the temperature of conductors and insulation. Current in the
</p>
<p>windings creates Joule losses which are proportional to the square of the current.
</p>
<p>The temperature of the machine is increased in proportion to generated heat.
</p>
<p>Increased temperature difference between the surface of an electrical machine and
</p>
<p>the environment gives a rise to heat transfer from the machine to the environment.
</p>
<p>The heat can be passed by conduction, convection, and radiation. Heat conduction
</p>
<p>takes place through the machine parts that are in touch with cold external solids such
</p>
<p>as the machine basis or flange. Heat convection relies on natural or forced streaming
</p>
<p>of air along the machine sides. Heat radiation is electromagnetic process caused by
</p>
<p>thermal motion of charged particles on the surface of electrical machine, and it
</p>
<p>depends on absolute temperature. The heat radiated from a warm machine to cold
</p>
<p>environment is larger than the heat absorbed by the machine due to radiation caused
</p>
<p>by the environment.
</p>
<p>When the surface temperature of electrical machine exceeds the temperature of
</p>
<p>the environment, the heat is transferred to the environment, and the machine is
</p>
<p>cooled. The power PT of the heat transfer defines how many joules of heat are
</p>
<p>transferred in each second. The processes of the heat transfer are nonlinear. Yet, for
</p>
<p>the range of temperatures encountered in operation of electrical machines, the power
</p>
<p>PT can be considered proportional to the temperature difference, PT &frac14; Dy /RT, where
RT is thermal resistance of an electrical machine with respect to the environment,
</p>
<p>proportional to the surface of the machine and characteristics of this surface. Power
</p>
<p>PT is expressed inW, temperature Dy in
oC, while thermal resistance RT is expressed
</p>
<p>in oC/W. The equilibrium is established when the machine temperature reaches the
</p>
<p>value that results in heat transfer PT which is equal to the total losses within the
</p>
<p>machine. Total losses of electrical machine are denoted by Pg. With PT &frac14; Pg,
machine temperature remains constant. The higher the losses in amachine, the higher
</p>
<p>the temperature reached in the steady state. Considering aDCmachine, an increase of
</p>
<p>armature current Ia increases Joule effect losses. They are proportional to I
2, and they
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>increase temperature of DC machine. Excessive temperature increase may damage
</p>
<p>some critical machine parts, such as the insulation of the windings.
</p>
<p>Electrical insulation is made of paper, fiberglass, lacquer, or other materials.
It separates copper conductors of machine windings from other conductive parts of
</p>
<p>machine, as well as from other conductors, thus preventing short circuits of the
</p>
<p>windings or their individual turns. The insulation can be damaged if temperature
</p>
<p>exceeds the maximum permissible limit for given insulating material. The insula-
</p>
<p>tion of thermal class A is damaged if the temperature exceeds 105 �C. For insulation
of class F, the temperature limit is 155 �C. Therefore, DC machine with class F
insulation would have higher permissible temperatures and higher rated current.
</p>
<p>When DC machine operates in steady state with the rated armature current, the
</p>
<p>losses are expected to heat the machine up to the temperature limit. With currents in
</p>
<p>excess to the rated, DC machine in continuous service would overheat. At the same
</p>
<p>time, temperature would exceed the limits and damage insulation or some other
</p>
<p>vital part of the machine. Other than insulation, there are other machine parts that
</p>
<p>are sensitive to elevated temperatures. Permanent magnets, ferromagnetic
</p>
<p>materials, and even the elements of steel construction of the machine could deteri-
</p>
<p>orate and fail due to excessive temperatures. Ferromagnetic materials lose their
</p>
<p>magnetic properties when heated up to Curie temperature. Permanent magnets
</p>
<p>could be permanently damaged (demagnetized) by overheating. The elements of
</p>
<p>steel construction such as the shaft and bearings could be damaged due to thermal
</p>
<p>dilatation, changes of steel properties, and failure in lubrication of the bearing at
</p>
<p>high temperatures.
</p>
<p>The rated current In is the highest armature current Ia in continuous service that
</p>
<p>does not cause any damage or fault and does not shorten the expected lifetime of the
</p>
<p>machine.
</p>
<p>13.5 Thermal Model and Intermittent Operation
</p>
<p>Conversion losses in an electrical machine lead to an increase of temperature of the
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit and windings. Machine is warmer than the environment, and it
</p>
<p>transfers heat to the environment. If the heat generated by the losses within the
</p>
<p>machine is equal to the heat transferred to the environment, the system is in steady-
</p>
<p>state conditions, and the temperature does not change. The temperature remains
</p>
<p>constant in cases where the heat generation remains in equilibrium with the heat
</p>
<p>emission. In other words, the heating has to be equal to cooling in order to achieve a
</p>
<p>constant temperature. The maximum permissible temperatures of vital parts of the
</p>
<p>machine are determined by endurance of the electrical insulation, magnetic circuit,
</p>
<p>windings, bearings, and housing. Variation of temperature in a machine is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by thermal resistance RT and thermal capacity CT, the two machine
</p>
<p>parameters discussed further on. The former determines the heat emission from
</p>
<p>the machine into the environment, while the latter determines the heat accumulated
</p>
<p>within the machine. If thermal capacity is sufficiently large, the machine can endure

<p>a short-term overload. In overload conditions, the current exceeds the rated, losses
</p>
<p>in the machine are increased, and the heat is generated in excess to the heat removed
</p>
<p>by cooling. Excess heat is accumulated in thermal capacity of the machine, and the
</p>
<p>temperature rises. With sufficiently large thermal capacity, the temperature does
</p>
<p>not reach the limits for significant interval of time. During that time, the armature
</p>
<p>current exceeds the rated value, but it does not cause any damage. Hence, depend-
</p>
<p>ing on thermal parameters of the machine and the current amplitude, an overload
</p>
<p>condition is permissible for certain interval of time. The impact of thermal resis-
</p>
<p>tance, thermal capacity, and power losses on temperature change is shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 13.1, which represents a simplified thermal model of an electrical machine.
</p>
<p>Electrical machines are made of copper, iron, aluminum, and insulating materials.
</p>
<p>Each material used in manufacturing electrical machines has its own specific heat.
</p>
<p>Specific heat represents the energy that raises by 1 �C the temperature of the unit
mass. By multiplying specific heat and mass of the part, one obtains thermal capacity
</p>
<p>of considered part, expressed in terms of J/�C. Based on the assumption that all parts
of the machine are at the same temperature, simplified thermal model is obtained and
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 13.1. Parameter CT of the thermal model represents the sum of thermal
</p>
<p>capacities of all machine parts. Total thermal capacity CT determines the heat which
</p>
<p>causes the machine temperature to increase of one degree, under condition with no
</p>
<p>heat being released into environment. The part of the loss power liable to the
</p>

</p>
<p>The remaining part of the loss power is transferred to the environment. When-
</p>

<p>power of heat emission to the environment, also called cooling power, assumes the

</p>
<p>Thermal resistance RT is expressed in

<p>conduction, and radiation. Thermal resistance depends on the surface area exposed
</p>
<p>toward the environment, on the airspeed, on properties of the surface which radiates

<p>the heat, and also on other circumstances and parameters. The change of the

</p>
<p>; (13.1)
</p>
<p>where the first factor describes the cooling power, while the second factor represents
</p>
<p>the rate of the heat accumulation in thermal capacity of the machine. The equation is
</p>
<p>derived under assumption that all the machine parts have the same temperature.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the equation resembles the one describing the voltage change
</p>
<p>in parallel RC circuit with resistor RT and capacitorCT, supplied from current source
</p>
<p>of the current Pg. Hence, thermal model of the machine of Fig. 13.1 is dual with the
</p>
<p>electrical RC circuit supplied from a current source. The voltage corresponds to
</p>
<p>the temperature increase Dy, while the current corresponds to the power of losses.
</p>
<p>In cases where Dy(0) &frac14; 0, and where the power of losses is represented by
Pg(t) &frac14; P1h(t), the temperature of the machine changes according to expression

<p>� �
</p>
<p>; (13.2)
</p>
<p>where t &frac14; RTCT is thermal time constant. The thermal time constant of small
electrical machines reaches several tens of seconds. Large machines may have
</p>
<p>their thermal time constants of several tens of minutes. Hence, the thermal pro-
</p>
<p>cesses within the machine are relatively slow. In Fig. 13.2, temperature change is
</p>
<p>presented for the case when the machine starts from the standstill, with the initial
</p>
<p>temperature equal to the ambient temperature. The operation proceeds with con-
</p>
<p>stant losses, and the temperature rises exponentially, according to the law given
</p>
<p>in (13.2). The temperature increase Dy approaches to the steady-state value
</p>
<p>Dy &frac14; PgRT after 3t .. 5t , where RT is the thermal resistance and t is the thermal
time constant.
</p>
<p>If power of machine losses changes due to variations of the current, torque, or the
</p>
<p>rotor speed, the machine temperature follows variations of power losses with certain
</p>
<p>delay, determined by the thermal time constant. Figure 13.3 shows temperature
</p>
<p>changes of an electrical machine having periodic changes of the armature current.
</p>
<p>The intervals with considerable armature current are followed by the intervals when
</p>
<p>the current is equal to zero. Former intervals are associated with losses, while the

<p>latter interval passes with no Joule effect losses. Presented operating mode is called
</p>
<p>intermittent mode. At steady state, temperature oscillates between yMAX and yMIN.
</p>
<p>In hypothetical prolonged no load conditions, the machine would reach the ambient
</p>
<p>temperature ya, that is, the temperature of the environment. The value of yMIN is
</p>
<p>higher than the ambient temperature ya. Assuming that the interval with the
</p>
<p>armature current is prolonged indefinitely, the temperature will reach the value
</p>
<p>y1 &frac14; ya &thorn;Dy &frac14; ya &thorn; Pg1�RT, where Pg1 &frac14; RaI12. The value of yMAX is lower than
y1. The power of losses Pg1 is shown in Fig. 13.3, and it corresponds to the
operation with armature current I1. In intermittent mode, this current can exceed
</p>
<p>the rated current and do no harm.
</p>
<p>With Ia &gt; In, power losses of Pg1 in continuous service cause the overheating.
Eventually, the machine temperature would reach y1 and damage some vital parts
of the machine. Nevertheless, the thermal capacity of the machine permits overload
</p>
<p>condition Ia &gt; In with higher loss power Pg1, but only for a short interval of time,
determined by the thermal time constant t &frac14; RTCT. Hence, any electrical machine
can withstand certain overload of limited duration. If such short time overloads are
</p>
<p>followed by intervals with no losses, the heat accumulated during overload pulses is
</p>
<p>released into ambient during prolonged intervals of time. With an adequate cooling,
</p>
<p>short time overloads can be repeated in the manner shown in Fig. 13.3. The
</p>
<p>overload intervals can be also followed by the intervals with loads that are suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently small to ensure a sufficient decrease in the machine temperature (cooling)
</p>
<p>before the next overload pulse.
</p>
<p>When the load torque and the machine current exhibit periodic changes, it is
</p>
<p>possible to identify load cycles that comprise one overload interval followed by an
</p>
<p>interval with reduced losses. If the period of the load cycling is shorter than the
</p>
<p>thermal time constant t, then the temperature oscillations yMAX � yMIN are rela-
tively small. With load cycle periods significantly shorter than t, the difference
</p>
<p>yMAX � yMIN becomes negligible. In such cases, the temperature increase Dy
depends on average losses within each load cycle. Notwithstanding periodic
</p>
<p>overloads, machine does not get damaged if the average power of losses does not
</p>
<p>exceed the rated loss power Pgn, permissible in continuous operation. Neglecting all
</p>
<p>the losses except the ones in the armature winding, the rated power of losses can be
</p>
<p>estimated as Pgn &frac14; RaIn2. The losses during the overload interval of the load cycle
may be considerably larger than the rated losses and yet maintain safe operation of
</p>
<p>electrical machine. The heat impulses generated during the overload intervals in

</p>
<p>Intermittent temperature rise yMAX � yMIN during overloads is inversely propor-
tional to the thermal capacity CT.
</p>
<p>Based on the performed analysis, it is concluded that the current of an electrical
</p>
<p>machine may exceed the rated current during short time intervals, provided that the
</p>
<p>overload intervals are much shorter compared to the thermal time constant of the
</p>
<p>machine. The overload pulses can come as a train, provided that the light load
</p>
<p>intervals in between secure sufficient cooling and sufficient drop of the machine
</p>
<p>temperature prior to arrival of the next pulse. With load that comes as a train of
</p>
<p>pulses, machine operation is safe if the repetition period is shorter than the thermal
</p>
<p>time constant, and provided that the average power of losses does not exceed the
</p>
<p>losses incurred with nominal current.
</p>
<p>Question (13.1): While operating with the rated load, the steady-state temperature
of an electrical machine is only slightly increased above the ambient temperature. Is
</p>
<p>it designed properly?
</p>
<p>Answer (13.1): No. Small steady-state operating temperatures show that the
power of losses within the machine is rather small. This means that there is plenty
</p>
<p>of room for increasing the current density and increasing the magnetic induction.
</p>
<p>The flux increase accompanied by the increase in the armature current raises the
</p>
<p>output torque and power. Hence, the machine under consideration can produce
</p>
<p>significantly higher torque and power compared to the power declared as the rated.
</p>
<p>Consequently, too much copper and too much iron are used to make the machine.
</p>
<p>Other than being more expensive, the machine is also larger and heavier. The same
</p>
<p>load requirements can be met by electrical machine of much smaller size and
</p>
<p>weight.
</p>
<p>Question (13.2): Electrical machine has not been used for a long time. After
turning on, the armature current reaches the value of 2In, twice the rated current.
</p>
<p>Prevailing losses are the winding losses. These are proportional to the square of the
</p>
<p>current. The iron losses can be neglected. The thermal time constant is 60s.
</p>
<p>Determine the longest permissible time the machine can be operated with 2In
with no damages.
</p>
<p>Answer (13.2): Permanent operation with twice the rated current produces the
power of losses which is four times larger than the rated power of losses. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the machine would heat up rather quickly. Theoretical value of the steady-state
</p>
<p>temperature in this mode is four times higher than the permissible temperature. The
</p>
<p>limit temperature is reached after t1, where 1 � exp(�t1/tT) &frac14; &frac14;. It follows that
t1 &frac14; 17.26 s.
Question (13.3): Electrical machine is loaded in such a way that every 10s a pulse
of armature current appears having the amplitude of 2In. This pulse is followed by
</p>
<p>an interval with no current. Prevailing losses in the machine are the winding losses,
</p>
<p>which are proportional to the square of the armature current, while the iron losses
</p>
<p>can be neglected. It is known that the thermal time constant is tT � 10s. Determine
</p>
<p>350 13 Characteristics of DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the longest permissible width of the armature current pulse which does not cause
</p>
<p>damages to the machine.
</p>
<p>Answer (13.3): Thermal time constant is significantly higher than the pulse period
(tT � 10 s). Therefore, temperature variations are slow, and the temperature
changes within the pulse period are insignificant. For that reason, it is possible to
</p>
<p>consider the average power of losses. With any periodic current i(t), the average
</p>
<p>power of Joule losses is calculated as

</p>
<p>thermal equivalent of periodic current i(t). A resistor with constant Ia(rms) will heat
</p>
<p>up very much the same as it does with periodic current i(t). If the rms value does not
</p>
<p>exceed the rated value In, the machine does not overheat. A pulse of amplitude 2In
that repeats every 10 s has the rms value of In provided that the pulse width is 2.5 s.
</p>
<p>13.6 Rated Flux
</p>
<p>Excitation fluxFf determines the current which has to be established in the armature
</p>
<p>winding so as to develop the desired torque, Ia &frac14; Tem/(kmFf). With higher values of
flux, one and the same torque is obtained with lower armature current, and this
</p>
<p>reduces the winding losses. Therefore, it is of interest to increase the flux in order to
</p>
<p>reduce the required armature current. The excitation flux is limited by magnetic
</p>
<p>saturation of the ferromagnetic material. If the region of saturation is reached, any
</p>
<p>further increase of the excitation current results in a very small change of the flux.
</p>
<p>While operating in saturation region, the only effect of increasing the excitation
</p>
<p>current is the increase in power of excitation winding losses RfIf
2. Magnetic satura-
</p>
<p>tion becomes pronounced at the knee of themagnetizing curveFf(If). The knee of the
</p>
<p>curve is the point where the initial, linear slope ends and the curve bends toward
</p>
<p>the abscissa, resulting in very small DF/DIf ratio. The flux at the knee point is
</p>
<p>denoted by Ffmax. Since any further increase of the excitation current is of little
</p>
<p>practical effect, the value Ffmax represents the maximum flux. This flux can be used
</p>
<p>in order to reduce the armature current Ia &frac14; Tem/(kmFf) required to achieve desired
torque Tem. Analysis performed in subsequent sections shows that, in certain
</p>
<p>operating conditions, the value ofFfmax cannot be used. An example is the operation
</p>
<p>at very high speeds, where the electromotive force keFfOmmust not exceed the rated
</p>
<p>voltage. In other cases, the flux Ffmax can be advantageously used, providing
</p>
<p>reduction in armature current. The knee point flux Ffmax is also called rated flux,
</p>
<p>and it is denoted by Fn.
</p>
<p>13.6 Rated Flux 351</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.7 Rated Speed
</p>
<p>Rotor speed of electrical machine influences electromotive force induced in the
</p>
<p>windings. Rated speed is defined as the rotor speed where electrical machine with
</p>
<p>rated flux has electromotive forces equal to the rated voltage. Hence, when the
</p>
<p>machine with rated flux accelerates from zero to the rated speed, the electromotive
</p>
<p>forces increase from zero up to the rated voltage.
</p>
<p>Electromotive forces should not exceed the rated voltage in order to avoid
</p>
<p>excessive voltage that could damage the insulation. Therefore, definition of the
</p>
<p>rated speed implies that the machine cannot exceed the rated speed yet maintaining
</p>
<p>the rated flux. In order to contain the electromotive forces between the rated limits,
</p>
<p>the flux has to be reduced as the speed goes beyond the rated speed.
</p>
<p>Considering a DC machine with rated excitation flux and with a negligible
</p>
<p>resistance Ra, the electromotive force Ea &frac14; keFnOm is induced, equal to the arma-
ture voltage Ua. At the rated speed, the electromotive force is equal to the rated
</p>
<p>voltage. Therefore, rated speed of DC machine is determined by relation
</p>
<p>On &frac14;
Un
</p>
<p>keFn
(13.3)
</p>
<p>Since the armature voltage should not exceed the rated value, the operation at
</p>
<p>speeds larger than the rated is possible only with a reduced flux. Otherwise, the
</p>
<p>electromotive force keFnOm would exceed the nominal voltage Un &frac14; keFnOn.
For small electrical machines, the voltage drop due to winding resistances cannot
</p>
<p>be neglected. Since Ua &frac14; RaIa &thorn; Ea, the difference between the armature voltage
and the electromotive force cannot be neglected. In such cases, definition of rated
</p>
<p>speed is made more precise, and it includes the voltage drop across the armature
</p>
<p>resistance. The rated speed can be defined as the one that results in rated voltage
</p>
<p>across the armature winding of electrical machine which operates with the rated
</p>
<p>flux and the rated current. In such conditions, the electromotive force is equal to
</p>
<p>Ea &frac14; keFnOn &frac14; Un � RaIn, while the rated speed is defined by expression
</p>
<p>On &frac14;
Un � RaIn
</p>
<p>keFn
: (13.4)
</p>
<p>13.8 Field Weakening
</p>
<p>Operation of DC machines may require changes in the excitation flux. One example
</p>
<p>is the operation at speeds above the rated speed. In order to keep the electromotive
</p>
<p>force within the limits of the rated voltage, the flux should be reduced so as to
</p>
<p>maintain the relation keFnOm &lt; Un. Flux reduction at high speeds is called field
weakening.
</p>
<p>352 13 Characteristics of DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In addition, there are cases when the flux reduction is beneficial even at speeds
</p>
<p>below the rated. When electrical machine runs with relatively low electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque, current is also low, as well as the power of losses in the winding. If at the
</p>
<p>same time the flux is kept at the rated value, the iron losses in the magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>become the principal conversion losses. In order to reduce the losses, it is necessary
</p>
<p>to reduce the flux. Lowering the flux increases the armature current required to
</p>
<p>develop desired torque, due to Ia &frac14; Tem/(kmFf). Operation with low Tem allows for
relatively large flux reduction without any significant increase in armature current.
</p>
<p>For this reason, flux reduction at light load condition reduces the conversion losses.
</p>
<p>13.8.1 High-Speed Operation
</p>
<p>The electromotive force induced in the winding determines the voltage across the
</p>
<p>winding terminals. Therefore, the electromotive force must not exceed the rated
</p>
<p>voltage. The rated flux, voltage and speed are related by Un � keFnOn. Therefore,
electrical machine running with the rated flux Fn has the electromotive force that
</p>
<p>reaches the rated voltage as the speed approaches the rated speed. Any increase of
</p>
<p>the speed above the rated would result in excessive voltages. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>excitation flux has to be decreased as the rotor speed goes beyond On. Hence,
</p>
<p>electrical machines can maintain the operating speed Om &gt; On, provided that the
flux is reduced so as to prevent the electromotive force from exceeding the rated
</p>
<p>voltage. For that to achieve, the flux should be varied according to the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>This change can be described by the function F(Om). Below the rated speed,
</p>
<p>F(Om) &frac14; Fn.
At speeds Om &gt; On, the electromotive force Ea &frac14; ke�F(Om)�Om is induced in
</p>
<p>the machine. Neglecting the armature resistance and assuming that Ea &frac14; Un, the
flux to be used beyond the rated speed is
</p>
<p>F Om&eth; &THORN; F&gt;Fnj &frac14;
Un
</p>
<p>keOm
: (13.5)
</p>
<p>From expression (13.3), which defines the rated speed, one obtains
</p>
<p>F Om&eth; &THORN; &frac14; Fn
On
</p>
<p>Om
; (13.6)
</p>
<p>which defines desired change of the flux at speeds above the rated speed. The flux is
</p>
<p>inversely proportional to the speed and varies according to 1/Om. Variation of the
</p>
<p>flux which is necessary at speeds beyond the rated speed is defined by (13.6).
</p>
<p>The operating region where the speed is higher than the rated speed is called
</p>
<p>field-weakening region. If machine operates at speeds below the rated speed, it is
</p>
<p>possible to have the rated excitation flux Fn. For this reason, the operating region
</p>
<p>where Om &lt; On is called constant flux region.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It should be noted that diagrams in Fig. 13.4. represent the change in available
</p>
<p>values or limit values, that is, the values that can be used at steady state without
</p>
<p>causing any damage to the machine. Hence, any value below these limits can be used
</p>
<p>as well. Due to thermal capacity of the machine, the instantaneous values of the
</p>
<p>current, torque, and power may exceed the limit values for a brief interval of time. At
</p>
<p>the same time, it is of interest to notice that presented diagram represents the absolute
</p>
<p>values. The torque, current, and power may also take negative values. Therefore,
</p>
<p>conclusions derived here are applicable to both motors and generators. Diagrams of
</p>
<p>Fig. 13.4 and the corresponding conclusions are applicable to any machine studied
</p>
<p>in this book, with exception of symbols which is slightly different for AC machine.
</p>
<p>13.8.3 Flux Change
</p>
<p>Abscissa of all the diagrams in Fig. 13.4 represents the rotor speed. At speeds below
</p>
<p>the rated speed, the excitation flux is maintained at themaximumvalue, which is also
</p>
<p>the rated value. As the speed exceeds the rated speed, the flux decreases according to
</p>
<p>hyperbola F(Om) &frac14; FnOn/Om. Machine can also use lower flux values, but they
cannot exceed the values shown by the curve F(Om).
</p>
<p>13.8.4 Electromotive Force Change
</p>
<p>The electromotive force varies according to the law Ea &frac14; ke�F(Om)�Om. Below the
rated speed, the flux is equal to the rated flux, and the electromotive force increases
</p>
<p>in proportion to the speed of rotation. In the region of the field weakening where
</p>
<p>Om &gt; On, the flux is inversely proportional to the rotor speed. If the speed
increases, the electromotive force remains constant and equal to the rated voltage.
</p>
<p>If the flux is below the value determined by (13.5), the electromotive force will be
</p>
<p>smaller than the rated voltage. In the region of field weakening, the flux F(Om) &frac14;
FnOn/Om has to be applied. If, at the same time, machine operates with very small
</p>
<p>torque and current, it is beneficial to reduce the flux even below the limit FnOn/Om,
</p>
<p>so as to reduce the iron losses.
</p>
<p>13.8.5 Current Change
</p>
<p>At steady state, the armature current must not exceed its rated value, Ia
2 � In2.
</p>
<p>The current can assume any value below the rated, |Ia| &lt; In. Exceeding the rated
value in continuous operation results in overheating and may damage magnetic
</p>
<p>and/or current circuits of the machine. For this reason, diagrams in Fig. 13.4
</p>
<p>indicate that the armature current applicable over long time intervals is limited by
</p>
<p>|Ia| &lt; In at all speeds.
</p>
<p>13.8 Field Weakening 355</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.8.6 Torque Change
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic torque is determined by the product of the flux and current. During
</p>
<p>long-term operation at speeds below the rated speed, the flux and current can hold
</p>
<p>their rated values. Therefore, in these conditions, available electromagnetic torque
</p>
<p>is Tn &frac14; kmOnIn, also called rated torque. At speeds above the rated speed, the flux
decreases according to expression FnOn/Om. Therefore, the available torque in the
</p>
<p>region of flux weakening is equal to T(Om) &frac14; TnOn/Om. The product of torque
which decreases with the speed and the speed results in a constant power. For this
</p>
<p>reason, the change of the available torque in the field-weakening mode is called
</p>
<p>hyperbola of constant power.
</p>
<p>13.8.7 Power Change
</p>
<p>Electrical power converted to mechanical power is equal to the product of the torque
</p>
<p>and the rotor speed. In constant flux region, at speeds below the rated, the available
</p>
<p>torque is constant, thus the available power increases proportionally with the speed.
</p>
<p>This region is also called the region of constant torque. In the region of field
</p>
<p>weakening, the power is equal to the rated power Pn &frac14; TnOn, since Pc &frac14; TemOm &frac14;
Om(TnOn/Om) &frac14; TnOn &frac14; Pn. Therefore, the available power in field-weakening
region is constant and equal to the rated power Pn. Another name for the field-
</p>
<p>weakening region is the region of constant power. Power Pn is called rated power.
</p>
<p>13.8.8 The Need for Field-Weakening Operation
</p>
<p>Applications of electric motors often require high values of electromagnetic torque
</p>
<p>at small speeds and small torques at high speeds. A DCmotor used for propulsion of
</p>
<p>electrical vehicles can serve as an example. While setting in motion a heavily
</p>
<p>loaded vehicle which has to manage a very steep slope, the motor has to deliver a
</p>
<p>very large torque. In such case, it is important to develop the torque required to get
</p>
<p>over the hill, while it is acceptable to operate the vehicle and the motor at a low
</p>
<p>speed. The same vehicle may have to move unloaded over prolonged, flat path,
</p>
<p>where the motion resistances are low, and where the motor delivers relatively small
</p>
<p>torque. At the same time, it could be required to complete such motion quickly, and
</p>
<p>this calls for high vehicle speeds and high rotor speeds.
</p>
<p>The first example requires high-torque, low-speed operation, while the second
</p>
<p>example calls for low-torque, high-speed operation. These requirements correspond
</p>
<p>to a hyperbola T(O) in T&ndash;O plane. The curve T(Om) &frac14; TnOn/Om is called hyperbola
of constant power. DC machines with permanent magnets cannot operate in the
</p>
<p>field-weakening mode. There are no practical ways to reduce the flux of the
</p>
<p>356 13 Characteristics of DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>magnets. Therefore, these machines cannot go beyond the rated speed. Hence, the
</p>
<p>constant power mode is inaccessible for this kind of DC machines. Whenever
</p>
<p>the need exists for such machines to provide the constant power at high speed,
</p>
<p>the problem cannot be solved on electrical side of the system. Instead, it is
</p>
<p>necessary to use mechanical coupling with variable transmission ratio. In cases
</p>
<p>when the electrical motor cannot increase the speed, as it has reached the rated rotor
</p>
<p>speed, transmission ratio of mechanical coupling can be changed so as to obtain
</p>
<p>higher load speeds with the same motor speed. Variable transmission ratio is used in
</p>
<p>road vehicles as well. Automobiles with internal combustion engines (ICE) are
</p>
<p>usually equipped with variable transmission gears. Torque-speed characteristics of
</p>
<p>internal combustion engines do not include constant power range hyperbola in T(O)
</p>
<p>plane. In order to provide for both the low-speed, high-torque operation and the
</p>
<p>high-speed, low-torque operation, it is necessary to change the transmission ratio of
</p>
<p>the gears that pass the ICE torque to the wheels. The use of electrical machines
</p>
<p>capable of providing constant power operation in field-weakening region removes
</p>
<p>the need for additional gears.
</p>
<p>13.9 Transient Characteristic
</p>
<p>The transient characteristic is the area in T(O) plane which comprises all T&ndash;O points
</p>
<p>attainable in short time intervals. That is, it is a collection of all the operating
</p>
<p>regimes the machine can support for a short while. Peak values of the torque which
</p>
<p>can be developed at a given speed depend on the excitation flux Ff(Om) and on
</p>
<p>the peak value of the armature current. In DC machines, instantaneous value of the
</p>
<p>current is limited by characteristics of mechanical commutator and on the maxi-
</p>
<p>mum current of the semiconductor power switches used to build the switching
</p>
<p>power converter that supplies the motor. An example of transient characteristic is
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 13.5.
</p>
<p>13.10 Steady-State Operating Area
</p>
<p>The steady-state operating area includes all the T-O points in T(O) plane where the
</p>
<p>machine can provide continuous service for a very long time. In the field-weakening
</p>
<p>region, the area is limited by the hyperbola of constant power, Tem(Om) &frac14; TnOn/Om,
while in the constant flux region the limit is Tem(Om) &frac14; Tn. An example of steady-
state operating area is shown in Fig. 13.5. Since operation of electrical machines
</p>
<p>includes all four quadrants, the steady-state operating area exists in all four
</p>
<p>quadrants as well.

<p>13.11 Power Losses and Power Balance
</p>
<p>For the purpose of getting a better insight into the process of electromechanical
</p>
<p>energy conversion in DC electrical machines, it is required to study the power flow
</p>
<p>and the power of losses in the machine. Power balance equation includes the factors
</p>
<p>such as the iron losses in magnetic circuits, Joule losses in windings (also called
</p>
<p>copper losses), and mechanical losses due to rotation, also called losses in mechan-
</p>
<p>ical subsystem.
</p>
<p>Losses in the compensation winding and the auxiliary poles windings are
</p>
<p>neglected, as these parts are not represented in each DC machine. While deriving
</p>
<p>the power balance, it is considered that the machine operates at steady state, with no
</p>
<p>variation of the armature current, excitation flux, torque, or the rotor speed. The
</p>
<p>power balance is shown in Fig. 13.6. The individual power components and losses
</p>
<p>are explained hereafter.
</p>
<p>13.11.1 Power of Supply
</p>
<p>The electrical sources feed the excitation and armature windings and supply the
</p>
<p>electrical power to the machine. The electrical power is Pf &thorn; Pa &frac14; UfIf &thorn; UaIa &frac14;
RfIf
</p>
<p>2 &thorn; (RaIa2 &thorn; EaIa).

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.11.2 Losses in Excitation Winding
</p>
<p>Due to Joule effect, the power of losses in the excitationwinding is converted to heat.
</p>
<p>It is equal to Rf If
2, and it is also referred to as copper losses in excitation winding.
</p>
<p>13.11.3 Losses Armature Winding
</p>
<p>Due to Joule effect, the power of losses in the armature winding is converted to
</p>
<p>heat. It is equal to Ra Ia
2, and it is also called copper losses in armature winding.
</p>
<p>13.11.4 Power of Electromechanical Conversion
</p>
<p>Power Pc &frac14; EaIa &frac14; (keFfOm)Ia &frac14; (kmFf Ia)Om &frac14; TemOm is power of the electro-
mechanical conversion. Electrical power EaIa is converted to mechanical power
</p>
<p>TemOm, and both of them are equal to Pc.
</p>
<p>13.11.5 Iron Losses (PFe)
</p>
<p>The iron losses depend on magnetic induction B and the frequency of its changes.
</p>
<p>Hence, the iron losses take place in those parts of the magnetic circuit where the
</p>
<p>magnetic field pulsates or revolves. On the other hand, in magnetic circuits where
</p>
<p>the magnetic field does not change neither its strength nor its orientation, the iron
</p>
<p>losses are equal to zero.
</p>
<p>Fig. 13.6 Power balance
</p>
<p>13.11 Power Losses and Power Balance 359</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In DC machines, the stator has the excitation winding with DC currents. Alter-
</p>
<p>natively, permanent magnets are used instead of the excitation winding. In both
</p>
<p>cases, consequential magnetic field within the stator magnetic circuit does not
</p>
<p>change and, hence, does not produce the iron losses.
</p>
<p>The rotor of a DC machine revolves in magnetic field of the excitation winding.
</p>
<p>Therefore, magnetic induction revolves relative to the rotor magnetic circuit. The
</p>
<p>frequency of changes of magnetic induction depends on the rotor speed. Due to
</p>
<p>magnetic induction changes, there are iron losses due to hysteresis and losses due to
</p>
<p>eddy currents. The iron losses have not been taken into account while developing
</p>
<p>the mathematical model. Yet, it is of interest to include them in the power balance
</p>
<p>equation. They are dependent on the square of the excitation flux, which determines
</p>
<p>magnetic induction. In addition, the losses are dependent upon the speed of rotation,
</p>
<p>because the field pulsates with respect to the iron sheets with a frequency which is
</p>
<p>equal to the angular speed of the rotor. The iron losses within the rotor are denoted
</p>
<p>by PFe. They exist even in cases when the armature winding is disconnected and
</p>
<p>does not have any current.
</p>
<p>The energy that accounts for these losses comes through the shaft, from the
</p>
<p>mechanical subsystem. When DC machine operates as a motor, braking torque
</p>
<p>TFe &frac14; PFe/Om is subtracted from the electromagnetic torque Tem, reducing
the torque passed to the work machine. Creation of the torque TFe can be explained
</p>
<p>in terms of joint action between the eddy currents in rotor iron and the excitation
</p>
<p>field that passes through the rotor. The torque TFe resists the motion in both
</p>
<p>directions of rotation.
</p>
<p>13.11.6 Mechanical Losses (PF)
</p>
<p>In the process of rotation, one part of the energy is spent on overcoming the friction
</p>
<p>in bearings and the air resistance.2 The rotor ends are supported by ball bearings
</p>
<p>which carry the rotor weight and provide support. The bearings are made in such
</p>
<p>way that the rotor can revolve freely. The friction between bearings and the rotor is
</p>
<p>very low, and it has a minor contribution to the machine losses. In the course of
</p>
<p>rotation, the rotor surface slides with respect to the air at certain peripheral speed,
</p>
<p>creating in such way the air resistance. Electrical machines could have their own
</p>
<p>cooling, provided by fixing a fan to one end of the rotor shaft. In the course of
</p>
<p>rotation, the fan creates an axial component of airstream which helps in removing
</p>
<p>the heat and provides better cooling of the machine. In this case, the air resistance is
</p>
<p>significantly higher. Besides the air resistance of the rotor, fan-cooled machines
</p>
<p>also have the losses due to the braking torque of the fan.
</p>
<p>2Resistance of the air can be modeled by expression Tair &frac14; kairOm2. If the air resistance prevails
among internal motion resistances, corresponding power is proportional to the third degree of the
</p>
<p>rotor speed, that is, Pair &frac14; kairOm3.
</p>
<p>360 13 Characteristics of DC Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.11.7 Losses Due to Rotation (PFe + PF)
</p>
<p>The sum of all the losses caused by rotation is called rotation losses, notwithstand-
</p>
<p>ing whether specific loss is of electrical or mechanical nature. Considering DC
</p>
<p>machines, losses due to rotation are equal to PFe &thorn; PF. Friction in the ball bearings,
the air resistance, and the braking torque TFe due to the iron losses
</p>
<p>3 belong to the
</p>
<p>internal motion resistances, namely, to phenomena that resist the rotation and
</p>
<p>originate from the electrical machine alone. The sum of internal motion resistances
</p>
<p>is often modeled by an approximate expression TF &frac14; kFOm.
The iron losses are due to hysteresis and eddy currents. The angular frequency
</p>
<p>om of the pulsation of magnetic induction in the rotor magnetic circuit is deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the rotor speed Om. For DC machines considered since,
4 om &frac14; Om. Since
</p>
<p>the power of iron losses in the rotor is PFe &frac14; kVom2 &thorn; kHom, the corresponding
braking torque is TFe &frac14; kVom &thorn; kH. The losses due to hysteresis are usually much
lower than the eddy current losses, thus TFe � kV om. Braking torque TFe due to
eddy currents in rotor magnetic circuit of DC machines corresponds entirely to the
</p>
<p>model TF &frac14; kFOm, but this is not the case with the air resistance torque which
depends on (Om)
</p>
<p>2. If torque TFe prevails, it is then justified to consider that the sum
</p>
<p>of motion resistances gets proportional to the speed. In this case, corresponding
</p>
<p>power of losses due to rotation is modeled by expression PF &frac14; kFOm2.
</p>
<p>13.11.8 Mechanical Power
</p>
<p>Electrical machine delivers to work machine mechanical power Pm. Mechanical
</p>
<p>power is obtained by subtracting the losses due to rotation from the power of
</p>
<p>electromechanical conversion. Mechanical power is equal to Pm &frac14; TmOm &frac14; Pc �
PFe � PF &frac14; TemOm � TFeOm � kFOm2. This power is delivered to the work
machine via shaft. The work machine resists the motion by the torque of the same
</p>
<p>magnitude (Tm &frac14; Pm/Om), acting in the opposite direction.
Question (13.4): Consider a DC machine having rated flux and the armature
current Ia &frac14; 0. The machine rotates at a constant, rated speed On. The torque
required for maintaining the rotation is provided by a driving machine coupled via
</p>
<p>shaft. Power of conversion Pc &frac14; EaIa is equal to zero. Are there any losses in the
</p>
<p>3Losses in the rotor magnetic circuit and their place in the power balance are different in DC,
</p>
<p>asynchronous, and synchronous machines.
4Namely, DC machines analyzed in this chapter have two magnetic poles of the stator (and two
</p>
<p>magnetic poles of the rotor). Hence, they have one pair of magnetic poles. Electrical machines
</p>
<p>with multiple pole pairs are described in the subsequent chapters. DC machines with p &gt; 1 pairs of
magnetic poles and with the rotor speed of Om have the angular frequency of the magnetic
</p>
<p>induction pulsations of om &frac14; pOm.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>rotor? Is there any torque acting on the rotor? Describe behavior of the rotor in the
</p>
<p>case that the coupling with the driving machine is broken.
</p>
<p>Answer (13.4): The rotor revolves in the magnetic field of the stator excitation.
Relative motion of the field with respect to the rotor magnetic circuit gives a rise to
</p>
<p>losses due to hysteresis and eddy current within the rotor iron sheets. Eddy currents
</p>
<p>that exist in the rotor interact with the magnetic field created by excitation winding.
</p>
<p>Therefore, minute forces are generated, resulting in torque TFe that acts against the
</p>
<p>motion. The torque which resists the motion is equal to TFe &frac14; PFe/On, where PFe
are the iron losses in the rotor. In order to keep the rotor spinning, this torque has to
</p>
<p>be fed from the driving machine. If the shaft is not coupled to the driving machine,
</p>
<p>the rotor would, due to the braking torque, gradually slow down. The losses in iron
</p>
<p>of the rotor would heat the rotor on account of its kinetic energy &frac12; JOn
2.
</p>
<p>13.12 Rated and Declared Values
</p>
<p>The rated parameters of DC machines have been defined in the preceding section.
</p>
<p>Rated current is the highest permissible current in continuous service that does not
</p>
<p>cause any damage or failure of DC machine. Rated voltage is the highest voltage
</p>
<p>which can be maintained permanently without causing breakdown or accelerated
</p>
<p>aging of electrical insulation. In similar way, the rated levels have been defined for
</p>
<p>the remaining variables. Rated value of each quantity should be understood as the
</p>
<p>highest acceptable value to be used in continuous service. Rated quantities are
</p>
<p>characteristics of the considered electrical machine or its vital parts.
</p>
<p>In addition to the rated quantities, the concept of declared quantities is frequently
</p>
<p>encountered as well. Declared values are equal to or lower than the rated values.
</p>
<p>They are usually written on the plate affixed to the machine and/or presented in
</p>
<p>catalogue data concerning the machine. Declared quantities are specified by the
</p>
<p>manufacturer. By specifying a declared quantity, the manufacturer gives a warranty
</p>
<p>that the machine can bear it during permanent operation without damage. For that
</p>
<p>reason, they cannot be higher than the rated quantities. A declared quantity can be
</p>
<p>lower than the rated. Manufacturer can intentionally give declared quantity which is
</p>
<p>lower than the rated. There could be commercial reasons for such derating.
</p>
<p>An example to that is the case when manufacturer has large-scale production of
</p>
<p>100-kW machines and receives request to deliver only one 90-kW machine.
</p>
<p>Manufacturing of a single machine is very expensive. Therefore, he would find no
</p>
<p>economic interest to make and deliver a single machine of 90 kW. Instead, manu-
</p>
<p>facturer takes one machine of 100 kW and affixes a plate declaring it as 90-kW
</p>
<p>machine. In doing so, the manufacturer gives a warranty that the machine can
</p>
<p>develop 90 kW during permanent operation and disregards the fact that the actual
</p>
<p>power can be higher.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.13 Nameplate Data
</p>
<p>Basic data concerning an electrical machine are written on its nameplate. In
</p>
<p>addition to declared speed and power, declared values are also given for current,
</p>
<p>voltage, and torque. A plate may contain the following data:
</p>
<p>&bull; Declared current of armature winding (In)
</p>
<p>&bull; Declared current of excitation winding (Ifn) (optional)
</p>
<p>&bull; Declared voltage of armature winding (Un)
</p>
<p>&bull; Declared voltage of excitation winding (Ufn) (optional)
</p>
<p>&bull; Declared speed of rotation
</p>
<p>&bull; Declared torque
</p>
<p>&bull; Declared power
</p>
<p>&bull; Declared power factor (for AC machines)
</p>
<p>&bull; Method of connecting three-phase stator winding (for AC machines)
</p>
<p>Declared speed is usually expressed in revolutions per minute [rpm]. Thus
</p>
<p>nn[rpm] &frac14; On[rad/s]&middot;(30/p). Declared speed is related to the declared operating
conditions. When the declared operating conditions correspond to the rated,
</p>
<p>declared speed is equal to the rated speed.
</p>
<p>The rated speed of DC generators corresponds to the speed when the generator
</p>
<p>with rated flux operates with rated current and provides rated voltage to electrical
</p>
<p>loads. Generator current produces voltage drop R
а
IG which is subtracted from
</p>
<p>the electromotive force. Since Un &frac14; keFnOn &thorn; RaIa &frac14; keFnOn � RaIG, the rated
speed of the generator results in electromotive force Ea &frac14; Un &thorn; RaIn. Therefore,
On &frac14; (Un &thorn; RaIn)/keFn.
</p>
<p>The rated speed of DCmotors corresponds to the speed when themotor with rated
</p>

Question (13.5): For generator of known parameters Un &frac14; 220 V, In &frac14; 20 A,
Ra &frac14; 1 O, and keFn &frac14; 1 Wb, determine the rated speed.
Answer (13.5): Rated speed of the generator is On &frac14; (Un &thorn; RaIn)/keFn &frac14; 240

Question (13.6): For motor of known parameters Un &frac14; 110 V, In &frac14; 10 A, Ra &frac14; 1
O, and keFn &frac14; 1 Wb, determine the rated speed.
Answer (13.6): Rated speed of the motor is On &frac14; (Un � RaIn)/keFn &frac14; 100 rad/s,
corresponding to nn &frac14; 955 rpm.

<p>Analysis of electrical machines mostly assumes that the rated speed is the ratio

<p>of the rated voltage and flux, On � Un/(keFn). This definition neglects the voltage
drop RaIa. The ratio Un/(keFn) gives the speed that results in electromotive force

<p>equal to the rated voltage, provided that DC machine has rated excitation.
</p>
<p>Disregarding the voltage drop, one obtains the rated speed as Un/(keFn), while the

<p>In all analyses and calculations where resistance Ra is neglected or it is

<p>Induction Machines
</p>
<p>The operating principles of induction machines and basic data concerning
</p>
<p>constructions of their stator and rotor are presented in this chapter. This chapter
</p>
<p>includes some basic information regarding construction of induction machines.
</p>
<p>Discussed and described are the stator windings, the rotor short-circuited cage
</p>
<p>winding, and slotted and laminated magnetic circuits of both stator and rotor.
</p>
<p>Fundamentals on creating the revolving magnetic field are reinstated for the
</p>
<p>three-phase stator winding. Basic operating principles of an induction machine
</p>
<p>are illustrated on simplified machine with one short-circuited rotor turn. The torque
</p>
<p>expression is developed and used to predict basic properties of mechanical charac-
</p>
<p>teristic. For the purpose of studying the electrical and mechanical properties
</p>
<p>of induction machines, corresponding mathematical model is developed in
</p>
<p>Chap. 15 and used within the next chapters. Chapter 16 deals with the steady-
</p>
<p>state operation, steady-state equivalent circuit and relevant parameters, mechanical
</p>
<p>characteristics, losses, and power balance. Variable speed operation of induction
</p>
<p>machines is discussed in Chap. 17, with analysis of constant frequency-supplied
</p>
<p>induction machines and introduction and analysis of variable frequency-supplied
</p>
<p>induction machines, fed from PWM-controlled three-phase inverters.
</p>
<p>14.1 Construction and Operating Principles
</p>
<p>Induction machines have stator comprising three-phase windings. Magnetic axes
</p>
<p>of the three phases are spatially shifted by 2p/3. If the stator phase windings have
</p>
<p>sinusoidal currents of the same amplitude and the same angular frequency oe, and
</p>
<p>at the same time their initial phases mutually differ by 2p/3, then the magnetic
</p>
<p>field within the machine revolves, maintaining the same amplitude. The speed
</p>
<p>of the field rotation is determined by the angular frequency oe of the source
</p>
<p>voltage. When an induction machine is fed from a network of industrial frequency
</p>
<p>f &frac14; 50 Hz, the field rotates at the speed of 100p rad/s. The rotor of an induction
machine has a short-circuited cage winding. If the rotor revolves at the same

<p>speed as the field does, they move synchronously, and there is no relative
</p>
<p>displacement between the two. In this case, there is no change of the flux in the
</p>
<p>rotor winding, and no electromotive force is induced. For that reason, there is no
</p>
<p>current in the rotor short-circuited winding. The speed of rotation of the magnetic
</p>
<p>field is called synchronous speed, and it is denoted by Oe. In the case when the
</p>
<p>difference Oslip &frac14; Oe � Om exists between the speed of the field Oe and speed of
the rotor, there is a change of flux in the rotor. An electromotive force is induced,
</p>
<p>and the electrical current is established in short-circuited rotor windings, which
</p>
<p>are usually made as squirrel cage. The frequency of rotor currents oslip depends
</p>
<p>on the speed difference Oslip, also called slip speed. The angular frequency oslip is
</p>
<p>called slip frequency. In machines with two magnetic poles (i.e., with p &frac14; 1 pair
of poles), oslip &frac14; Oslip. Joint action of the rotor currents and the stator field results
in electromagnetic torque Tem. This torque tends to bring the rotor into synchro-
</p>
<p>nism with the field. In the case when Oslip &frac14; Oe � Om &gt; 0, the torque tends to
increase the rotor speed and to bring the rotor closer to synchronism with the
</p>
<p>rotation of the field.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>rotor slots which, in the considered rotor, are not straight but are set obliquely. The
</p>
<p>rotor conductors are short circuited by aluminum rings (17) at the front and rear
</p>
<p>sides of the rotor cylinder. The aluminum rings (17) are extended to winglets
</p>
<p>intended to create an airstream for cooling. The stator conductors (26) are made
</p>
<p>of copper and covered by electrical insulation. They are laid in the slots of the stator
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit (13). At the rear side of the motor, the shaft may be equipped with
</p>
<p>a fan (23) that creates an airstream along the external sides of the housing. This
</p>
<p>method of assisting the heat transfer is called self-cooling. The self-cooling is
</p>
<p>not suitable for the motors rotating at high speeds, where the fan would create
</p>
<p>significant losses and acoustic noise.
</p>
<p>14.2 Magnetic Circuits
</p>
<p>The voltages and currents in the stator windings of an inductionmachine have angular
</p>
<p>frequencyoe. Electromotive forces induced in the rotor have angular frequencyoslip,
</p>
<p>and they cause electrical currents of the same frequency in short-circuited rotor
</p>
<p>winding. The flux and magnetic induction of the stator vary at angular frequency
</p>
<p>oe. Induction machines operated from the mains have angular frequencyoe equal to
</p>
<p>100p. The flux and magnetic induction of the rotor have angular frequencyoslip. For
</p>
<p>induction machines of several kW, the slip frequency is of the order of 1 Hz. Hence,
</p>
<p>magnetic induction pulsates with respect to the stator magnetic circuit at the line
</p>
<p>frequency. It also pulsates with respect to the rotor magnetic circuits at lower
</p>
<p>frequency. In order to reduce iron losses due to eddy currents, both stator and rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuits are laminated, that is, they are made of iron sheets. The shape of
</p>
<p>these sheets is shown in Fig. 14.2.
</p>
<p>By stacking iron sheets, cylindrical magnetic circuits of the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>are obtained. The stator magnetic circuit is a hollow cylinder. The rotor cylinder
</p>
<p>is placed axially within the stator. The two parts are separated by the air gap.

induction machine
</p>
<p>14.2 Magnetic Circuits 367</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>On the internal surface of the stator magnetic circuit, there are axial slots facing
</p>
<p>the air gap. The same way, the outer surface of the rotor has axial slots facing the
</p>
<p>air gap. The slots are used for placing conductors that constitute stator and rotor
</p>
<p>windings. The stator slots comprise copper conductors. In most cases, they have a
</p>
<p>round cross section. The stator conductors can be isolated by resin. They are
</p>
<p>connected so as to make three stator coils, also called three phases or three parts
</p>
<p>of the stator winding. The rotor slots are mostly filled by aluminum bars, often
</p>
<p>made by casting which consists of pouring liquid aluminum into the rotor slots.
</p>
<p>These bars are short circuited by the front and rear aluminum rings, forming in
</p>
<p>this way short-circuited rotor winding called squirrel cage. A cross section of
</p>
<p>the machine, shown in Fig. 14.3, indicates positions of conductors with respect to
</p>
<p>the magnetic circuits.
</p>
<p>Figure 14.4 shows the shape of rotor conductors and the short-circuiting rings. To
</p>
<p>visualize the rotor cage, it is assumed that the magnetic circuit is removed.
</p>
<p>Similarity to the cage and the circumstance that the turns are short circuited gave
</p>
<p>the name cage rotor. Sometimes, machines having aluminum-cast short-circuited

<p>rotors are called squirrel cage rotor machines. In high-power machines, where it is
</p>
<p>significant to increase the energy efficiency, rotor conductors are made of copper
</p>
<p>bars. Copper has lower specific resistance compared to aluminum, which reduces
</p>
<p>specific and total losses in the rotor cage.
</p>
<p>Rotor conductors have their electrical insulation made differently. An electrical
</p>
<p>contact between the rotor bars, cast into the rotor slots, and iron sheets that constitute
</p>
<p>the rotor magnetic circuit gives a rise to sparse electrical currents that can jeopardize
</p>
<p>performances of the machine. These currents can be avoided by applying an acid
</p>
<p>solution to internal surfaces of the rotor slots before casting the aluminum bars or by
</p>
<p>making the inner surfaces nonconductive in some other way. The insulation layer
</p>
<p>created in this way separates aluminum bar from the magnetic circuit and prevents
</p>
<p>any uncontrollable currents. Exceptionally, the rotor of induction machine can have
</p>
<p>a three-phase winding made of round, insulated copper wire, in the way quite similar
</p>
<p>to the one used in manufacturing the stator winding. In such cases, the three rotor
</p>
<p>terminals are made available to the user. Such rotor is also calledwound rotor, and it
</p>
<p>is briefly explained within the next paragraphs. It has been used prior to deployment
</p>
<p>of three-phase, variable frequency static power converters. Wound rotor machines
</p>
<p>are rarely met nowadays, as a vast majority of induction machines have a cage rotor.
</p>
<p>Prescribed method of manufacturing the rotor cage is rather simple, and it
</p>
<p>does not require high-precision processing nor any special technologies or materials.
</p>
<p>Manufacturing of the rotor of DC machine is considerably more involved and
</p>
<p>complicated. It requires mechanical commutator, device that requires rather precise
</p>
<p>production process and which contains a number of different materials.
</p>
<p>Compared to DC machines, induction machines have a number of advantages.
</p>
<p>They include rather simple manufacturing procedure, robustness, higher specific
</p>
<p>power DP/Dm, lower mass and volume, as well as possibility to operate at
</p>
<p>considerably higher rotor speeds compared to DC machines. Therefore, induction
</p>
<p>machines are the most widespread machines nowadays. Absence of the brushes and
</p>
<p>collector eliminates the maintenance and prolongs the lifetime. Robust construction
</p>
<p>of induction motor results in an improved reliability, which is usually expressed by
</p>
<p>the mean time between failures (MTBF).
</p>
<p>Over the past century, most induction machines were operated from the mains,
</p>
<p>namely, supplied by AC voltages of fixed amplitude, having the line frequency.
</p>
<p>These machines were mostly running with constant speed. Speed regulation was
</p>
<p>possible only with wound rotor.
</p>
<p>With recent developments in the area of power converters, semiconductor power
</p>
<p>switches, digital signal processors (DSP), and digital controls of power converters
</p>
<p>and drives, it is possible nowadays to design, manufacture, and deploy reliable and
</p>
<p>affordable systems based on induction motors supplied from static power converters
</p>
<p>providing variable frequency AC voltages. Variable frequency supply allows for
</p>
<p>efficient and reliable operation of induction machines over wide range of speeds.
</p>
<p>Digitally controlled induction motors are frequently used as the torque actuators in
</p>
<p>motion control systems.

<p>14.3 Cage Rotor and Wound Rotor
</p>
<p>In addition to short-circuited rotor, it is possible to encounter wound rotor induction
</p>
<p>machines with slip rings used for external access to the rotor winding. Induction
</p>
<p>motors with wound rotors have been used at times when there was no possibility to
</p>
<p>change the amplitude and frequency of the stator voltages. The stator used to be fed
</p>
<p>from the mains, with the amplitude and frequency which could not be changed.
</p>
<p>At that time, there were no suitable static power converters capable of converting
</p>
<p>the electrical energy of line-frequency voltages and currents into the energy
</p>
<p>of variable frequency voltages and currents. Under these conditions, application
</p>
<p>of induction machines with wound rotors was used to alter the rotor speed of
</p>
<p>line-frequency-supplied inductions machines. Today, the use of wound rotor
</p>
<p>motors is declining, and the use of squirrel cage motors is prevailing.
</p>
<p>Part (a) in Fig. 14.5 shows a short-circuited cage rotor of induction machine. Part
</p>
<p>(b) shows a wound rotor which has a three-phase winding similar to that of the
</p>
<p>stator. The three-phase windings are usually star connected, while the remaining
</p>
<p>three terminals of the rotor winding are connected to metal rings called slip rings,
</p>
<p>mounted at the front end of the machine. When the motor is in service, there are
</p>
<p>sliding brushes pressed against the rings, providing electrical contact and making
</p>
<p>the rotor terminals accessible to external uses. Sliding brushes are elastic
</p>
<p>metal-graphite plates which slide, as the rotor revolves, along peripheral surface
</p>
<p>of the rings. By connecting three external resistors to the rotor circuit, the
</p>
<p>equivalent resistance of the rotor circuit changes, and this alters the mechanical
</p>
<p>characteristic of the motor, allowing for desired speed changes.
</p>
<p>The need for applying wound rotor machines has disappeared along with the
</p>
<p>appearance of static power converters which allow continuous change of the supply
</p>
<p>frequency and, hence, continuous change of the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>14.4 Three-Phase Stator Winding
</p>
<p>Stator of induction machines has three-phase windings, namely, three separate coils
</p>
<p>making the system of stator windings. Each phase winding has two terminals.
</p>
<p>The three-phase windings can be star connected or delta connected. Star connection
</p>
<p>Fig. 14.5 (a) Cage rotor. (b) Wound rotor with slip rings
</p>
<p>370 14 Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is denoted by Y and delta connection by D. With star connection, one terminal of
</p>
<p>each phase winding is connected to three-phase AC source, while the other phase
</p>
<p>terminals are connected to a common node. This common node is called star point.
</p>
<p>With the star point having no other connections (floating), the sum of the
</p>
<p>three-phase currents must be equal to zero at every instant, ia(t) + ib(t) + ic(t) &frac14; 0.
Most star-connected stator windings have their star point floating. Exceptionally,
</p>
<p>some large-power, high-voltage1 induction machines may have their star point
</p>
<p>connected.2
</p>
<p>In some cases, phases of the three-phase stator winding are connected to delta
</p>
<p>connection, wherein the three-phase windings are connected into triangle, restricting
</p>
<p>the phase voltages by ua(t) + ub(t) + uc(t) &frac14; 0. For the given power rating, delta
connection has lower current in stator conductors with respect to star connection.
</p>
<p>Therefore, delta connection is advantageously used in electrical machines with
</p>
<p>exceptionally low stator voltages, such as the motors in battery-fed traction drives,
</p>
<p>where the stator current is very large.
</p>
<p>There are advantages of star connection which make it more frequently used.3
</p>
<p>Without the lack of generality, it is assumed throughout this book that the stator
</p>
<p>phases are star connected.
</p>
<p>Magnetic axes of the stator phase windings are spatially shifted by 2p/3, as shown
</p>
<p>in Fig. 14.6. Desired magnetic field within three-phase induction machines is
</p>
<p>established by establishing the phase currents of the same amplitude Im and the
</p>
<p>same angular frequencyoe. Their initial phases have to be shifted by 2p/3, the angle
</p>
<p>that corresponds to the spatial shift between magnetic axes of the three phases. With
</p>
<p>prescribed currents in the phase windings, magnetic field is established in magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits and the air gap of the machine. The field revolves at angular speedOe &frac14; oe.4
The phase currents of the same amplitude and frequency, and with the initial phase
</p>
<p>1Voltages in excess to 1 kV are called high voltages. The termmedium voltage is also in use, and it
</p>
<p>refers to lower end of high voltages and corresponds to voltages from 1 up to 10 kV. The upper
</p>
<p>limit of medium voltages is not strictly defined. There are also terms very high voltages and
</p>
<p>ultrahigh voltage, both lacking a clear definition.
2High-voltage induction machines have an increased insulation stress. Due to transient phenom-
</p>
<p>ena, floating star point may have considerable overvoltages. In some cases, star point of high-
</p>
<p>voltage machines is grounded by means of impedance connected between the star point and the
</p>
<p>ground.
3The sum of the phase voltages of delta-connected phase windings is equal to zero, ua(t) +
</p>
<p>ub(t) + uc(t) &frac14; 0. Practical AC machines have imperfect, nonsinusoidal electromotive forces that
include harmonics such as the third, which has the same initial phase in all the three-phase windings.
</p>
<p>This is the property of all 3nth harmonic, also called triplian harmonics. Within the three phases of
</p>
<p>the stator winding, the waveforms of a triplian harmonics have the same amplitude and phase.
</p>
<p>Therefore, with star connection, triplian harmonics cannot produce any current due to ia(t) + ib(t) +
</p>
<p>ic(t) &frac14; 0. On the other hand, delta connection provides the circular path for triplian harmonics of the
stator current. With delta connection, any distortion in electromotive forces that results triplian
</p>
<p>harmonics contributes to circular currents which compromise the operation of induction machine by
</p>
<p>increasing losses.

<p>In Fig. 14.6, the phase windings are denoted by coils. Each of the three coil signs
</p>
<p>represents one phase winding. The phase windings have their conductors distributed
</p>
<p>in a number of stator slots along themachine circumference, next to the inner surface
</p>
<p>of the stator magnetic circuit. It is understood that conductor density has sinusoidal
</p>
<p>change along the air-gap circumference, as shown in Fig. 14.7. In this figure, the coil
</p>
<p>sign denotes the winding and lies on its magnetic axis. Shortened representation of
</p>
<p>phase windings places a coil sign instead of introducing a number of distributed
</p>
<p>conductors. These signs are used for clarity. An attempt to represent all the three
</p>
<p>phases by drawing their individual conductors would result in a drawing which is of
</p>
<p>little practical value.
</p>
<p>Magnetomotive force of phase winding has an amplitude determined by the
</p>
<p>phase current, while the corresponding vector extends along the magnetic axis of
</p>
<p>the winding. The winding flux vector has the same direction. Hence, the winding
</p>
<p>represented by coil symbol has the magnetomotive force and flux vectors directed
</p>
<p>along the axis indicated by the symbol of coil that represents the winding.

<p>14.5 Rotating Magnetic Field
</p>
<p>Each phase winding creates a magnetomotive force along the magnetic axis of the
</p>
<p>winding. Amplitudes of magnetomotive forces Fa, Fb, and и Fc are dependent on
</p>
<p>currents ia(t), ib(t), and ic(t). Vector sum of these magnetomotive forces gives
</p>
<p>the resultant magnetomotive force of the stator Fs (Fig. 14.8). The quotient of the
</p>
<p>vector Fs and magnetic resistance Rm gives the stator flux vector. The lines of the
</p>
<p>stator flux pass through the air gap and encircle the rotor magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>(Fig. 14.9). Passing through aluminum cast, short-circuited rotor turns, the stator
</p>
<p>flux contributes to the rotor flux. The coefficient of proportionality is determined by
</p>
<p>the mutual inductance Lm between the stator winding and the rotor cage. In cases
</p>
<p>when the rotor revolves in synchronism with the field (Om &frac14; Oe), there is no change
of the rotor flux. Therefore, maintaining the synchronism, the rotor electromotive
</p>
<p>force is equal to zero as well as the rotor current.
</p>
<p>When the rotor speed is lower than the synchronous speed (Om &lt; Oe), the rotor
is lagging with respect to the field. The speed difference Oslip &frac14; Oe � Om &gt; 0 is
called slip speed. For the observer residing on the rotor, in the frame of reference of
</p>
<p>short-circuited rotor cage, the stator flux revolves with relative speed of Oslip,

</p>
<p>magnetic field. They have one north magnetic pole and one south magnetic pole. These machines
</p>
<p>are called two-polemachines, and they have p &frac14; 1 pair of magnetic poles. Machines with multiple
pairs of magnetic poles will be explained as well. As an example, distribution of magnetic field in
</p>
<p>the air gap may have two north and two south magnetic poles. The number of pairs of poles is
</p>
<p>denoted by p. It will be shown later that the magnetic field created by AC currents of angular
</p>
<p>frequency oe rotates at angular frequency Oe &frac14; oe/p. Therefore, for two-pole machines, angular
frequency oe is equal to the angular speed of rotation Oe.

<p>slip oslip is rather small, the rotor current is approximately equal to e/R. Joint action
</p>
<p>of the magnetic field and currents in rotor conductors creates electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque which tends to bring the rotor into synchronism with the field. Namely, in
</p>
<p>cases where Oe � Om &gt; 0, the torque acts upon the rotor so as to increase the rotor
speed Om and bring it closer to the synchronous speed Oe.

<p>14.6 Principles of Torque Generation
</p>
<p>Principle of operation of an induction machine can be explained by using
</p>
<p>Fig. 14.10. Represented flux Fm revolves at the synchronous speed Oe. It is
</p>
<p>assumed that the rotor revolves at the speed of Om &lt; Oe, meaning that the rotor
is lagging behind the flux by the amount of slip,
</p>
<p>oslip &frac14; Oslip &frac14; Oe � Om&gt;0 (14.2)
</p>
<p>Angle yslip between the flux vectorFm and the rotor is equal to the integral of the
</p>
<p>slip; thus, it increases gradually. The figure shows only one short-circuited contour
</p>
<p>of the rotor in order to explain the principle of the torque generation. The flux
</p>
<p>within the rotor contour changes with the angle yslip,
</p>

</p>
<p>t
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>Oslip dt (14.3)
</p>
<p>Angle between the reference axis of the contour and the flux vector is yslip + p/2.
</p>
<p>The part of the stator flux which encircles the rotor contour is equal to
</p>
<p>FRm &frac14; �Fm � sin yslip: (14.4)
</p>
<p>The total rotor flux includes the effects of rotor current which contribute to the
</p>
<p>rotor flux in proportion to the coefficient of self-inductance LR. In the course of
</p>
<p>gaining an insight into the operating principles, these effects are neglected for the
</p>
<p>time being. This assumption is justified by the fact that with relatively low slip
</p>
<p>frequencies, the reactance LRoslip can be neglected. Hence, it is considered instead
</p>
<p>that the mutual flux FRm &frac14; �Fm�sin(yslip) corresponds to the total rotor flux FR.

</p>
<p>14.6 Principles of Torque Generation 375</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Thus, the electromotive force induced in the rotor winding is proportional to the
</p>
<p>flux Fm and to the slip frequency oslip
</p>
<p>e &frac14; dFR
dt
</p>
<p>&frac14; �Fm � Oslip cos yslip (14.5)
</p>
<p>In steady state, yslip &frac14; Oslipt. Therefore, rotor current is an AC current. Its
amplitude is inversely proportional to the rotor impedance R + joslipL. For small
</p>
<p>values of slip, resistance R is considerably higher than reactance oslipL. Hence, the
</p>
<p>rotor current iR is approximately equal to e/R ~ Fmoslip

<p>RR
cos yslip (14.6)
</p>
<p>In the case under consideration, iR &gt; 0. Direction of the rotor current
corresponds to direction shown in Fig. 14.10. Validity of this conclusion is checked
</p>
<p>by the following reasoning. Since the fluxFm advances with respect to the rotor, the
</p>
<p>flux in the rotor contour in Fig. 14.10 changes its value. It increases in direction
</p>
<p>opposite to the reference direction nR.
</p>
<p>The induced electromotive force in short-circuited rotor turn and the consequen-
</p>
<p>tial rotor current have direction opposite to the change of the flux, wherein the flux
</p>
<p>change is the origin of the electromotive force. Hence, direction of the rotor current
</p>
<p>pretends to establish the flux which opposes to the original flux change. With
</p>
<p>reference directions as shown in Fig. 14.10, the rotor current causes the flux change
</p>
<p>which is directed downward. The rotor current varies in proportion to function cos
</p>
<p>(yslip) &frac14; cos(y0 + oslipt). It is an AC current of frequency oslip. In rotors with
multiple turns, AC currents create the flux which revolves with respect to the
</p>
<p>rotor at the slip speed of Oslip &frac14; oslip/p. With the rotor running at the speed of
Om, the speed of the rotor flux rotation with respect to the stator is equal to
</p>
<p>Om + Oslip &frac14; Om + (Oe � Om) &frac14; Oe. Hence, the stator and rotor flux vectors of
induction machine revolve in synchronism, at the same speed of Oe, determined by
</p>
<p>the supply frequency oe. In steady state, the stator and rotor flux vectors maintain
</p>
<p>their relative position.
</p>
<p>14.7 Torque Expression
</p>
<p>Joint action of the magnetic field and rotor currents creates the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque which tends to bring rotor into synchronism with the field. Simplified
</p>
<p>structure in Fig. 14.10 can be used to derive some basic relations between the
</p>
<p>torque, flux, and the slip frequency.
</p>
<p>In the region of the rotor conductor denoted by
J
</p>
<p>, there is radial component of
</p>
<p>the magnetic induction equal to Bm�cos(yslip), where Bm is the maximum induction
in the air gap. This analysis assumes that the air-gap flux is created primarily by the
</p>
<p>376 14 Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>stator currents and that the induced rotor currents have a negligible effect on the
</p>
<p>magnetic inductance in the air gap. Magnetic induction assumes the maximum
</p>
<p>value of Bm in the air-gap regions along the flux vector Fm. In other directions, its
</p>
<p>value is smaller, and it changes according to the expression for sinusoidal distribu-
</p>
<p>tion of the radial component of magnetic induction in the air gap. Hence, for the air-
</p>
<p>gap region displaced by Dy from direction of the vector Fm, magnetic inductance
</p>
<p>assumes the value of B &frac14; Bmcos(Dy). Electrical current of the rotor is equal to
iR &frac14; Fm�oslip�cosyslip/RR. The force acting on the conductor denoted by
</p>
<p>J
</p>
<p>is equal
</p>
<p>to the product LiRB, where L is the axial length of the machine. An equal force is
</p>
<p>acting on the conductor denoted by
N
</p>
<p>. Direction of both forces is positive with
</p>
<p>respect to the reference tangential direction. Direction of the current in the second
</p>
<p>conductor is changed. Direction of the magnetic induction is also changed. In the
</p>
<p>region of conductor
N
</p>
<p>, magnetic field comes out of the stator magnetic circuit,
</p>
<p>passes through the air gap, and enters into the rotor magnetic circuit.
</p>
<p>Expression Fm &frac14; (2/p)BmpRL &frac14; 2BmRL relates flux Fm to the maximum value
of magnetic induction Bm. In this expression, R &frac14; D/2 is the radius of the rotor
cylinder. Therefore, the expression for magnetic induction obtains the form
</p>
<p>B &frac14; k1 � Fm cos yslip &frac14; Bm cos yslip (14.7)
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic torque is equal to
</p>
<p>Tem &frac14; DL iRB &frac14; DL
Fmoslip cos yslip
</p>
<p>RR
Bm cos yslip (14.8)

<p>� (14.9)
</p>
<p>Therefore, the torque delivered by an induction machine is directly proportional
</p>
<p>to the slip frequency and to the square of the flux. It is inversely proportional to the
</p>
<p>rotor resistance.
</p>
<p>Question (14.1): In the case considered above, the torque is proportional to
cos2(yslip) &frac14; cos2(y0 + oslipt). Therefore, the torque pulsates from zero up to twice
the average value. Is it possible to alter the structure of Fig. 14.10 so as to obtain a
</p>
<p>constant, ripple-free torque?
</p>
<p>Answer (14.1): By adding another short-circuited contour on the rotor, shifted by
p/2 with respect to the existing one, the torque pulsations can be suppressed. The
</p>
<p>torque acting on conductors of the second contour will be proportional to sin2(yslip).
</p>
<p>When added to previously obtained torque, proportional to cos2(yslip), the sum of
</p>
<p>the two becomes Tem &frac14; Fm2oslip/RR &frac14; const.

</p>
<p>Modeling of Induction Machines
</p>
<p>This chapter introduces and explains mathematical model of induction machines.
</p>
<p>This model represents transient and steady-state behavior in electrical and mechan-
</p>
<p>ical subsystems of the machine. Analysis and discussion introduces and explains
</p>
<p>Clarke and Park coordinate transforms. The model includes differential equations
</p>
<p>that express the voltage balance in stator and rotor windings, inductance matrix
</p>
<p>which relates flux linkages and currents, Newton differential equation of motion,
</p>
<p>expression for the air-gap power, and expression for the electromagnetic torque.
</p>
<p>The model development process starts with replacing the three-phase machine with
</p>
<p>two-phase equivalent. Namely, the three-phase voltages, currents, and flux linkages
</p>
<p>are transformed in two-phase variables by appropriate transformation matrix which
</p>
<p>implements 3F/2F transform, also called Clarke coordinate transform. Two-phase
</p>
<p>model is formulated in stationary coordinate frame. The drawbacks and difficulties
</p>
<p>in using this model are the rationale for introducing and applying Park coordinate
</p>
<p>transform, which results in the machine model in synchronous dq coordinate frame.
</p>
<p>Necessary techniques and procedures of applying and using coordinate transforms
</p>
<p>are explained in detail, including representation of machine vectors by complex
</p>
<p>numbers. The operable model of induction machines is obtained in dq coordinate
</p>
<p>frame which revolves synchronously with the stator field. The merits and practical
</p>
<p>uses of the model in dq frame are explained at the end of the chapter.
</p>
<p>15.1 Modeling Steady State and Transient Phenomena
</p>
<p>The work with induction machines requires a sound knowledge of their behavior
</p>
<p>and principal characteristics. From the electrical access point, it is of interest to find
</p>
<p>relations between steady-state voltage and currents, so as to obtain an equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit of the machine, representing the steady-state operation. At the same time, it
</p>
<p>is important to study the torque&ndash;speed relations at the mechanical access of the
</p>
<p>machine.

<p>Analysis of induction machines at steady state is based on mechanical
characteristics and steady-state equivalent circuit. Mechanical characteristic of
</p>
<p>an induction machine gives relation between steady-state values of the electromag-
</p>
<p>netic torque and the rotor speed. The mechanical characteristic is dependent on the
</p>
<p>frequency and amplitude of the stator voltage. Therefore, any change in stator
</p>
<p>voltage will affect the mechanical characteristic. At steady state, the voltages and
</p>
<p>currents are sinusoidal quantities of constant amplitude and frequency. For that
</p>
<p>reason, they can be represented by appropriate phasors.1 Relations between
</p>
<p>voltages and currents can be presented by equivalent circuit. A steady-state equiv-
</p>
<p>alent circuit is a network consisting of resistances and reactances which serves for
</p>
<p>calculation of phasors of the stator and rotor currents in conditions with known
</p>
<p>supply conditions and specified rotor speed.
</p>
<p>Working on problems of supplying and controlling induction machines
requires a good knowledge of the dynamic model. This model comprises differen-
</p>
<p>tial equations and algebraic expressions relating the machine variables and
</p>
<p>parameters during transient processes and also in the steady state. Relation between
</p>
<p>the voltages and currents during transients is given by differential equations
</p>
<p>describing the voltage equilibrium in the windings, also called voltage balance
</p>
<p>equations. The voltage balance equations describe the electrical subsystem of
</p>
<p>induction machine. The mechanical subsystem is described by Newton differential
</p>
<p>equation of motion. The set of differential equations and expressions describing
</p>
<p>behavior of the machine is called mathematical model or dynamic model.
</p>
<p>In further considerations, the analyses of electrical and mechanical subsystems
</p>
<p>of induction machines are presented and explained, resulting in dynamic model.
</p>
<p>This model includes transforms of the state coordinates, also called coordinate
</p>
<p>transforms. They facilitate the analysis of transient processes in both synchronous
</p>
<p>and induction machines. Dynamic model is usually mostly used for transient
</p>
<p>analysis and for solving control problems, but it can also be used to resolve steady
</p>
<p>states. Starting from dynamic model, one can obtain the steady-state relations;
</p>
<p>mechanical characteristics; relations between voltages, currents, fluxes, torques,
</p>
<p>and speed in the steady state; as well as the steady-state equivalent circuit.
</p>
<p>The readers with no interest in transient processes in induction machines and
</p>
<p>with no need to deal with problems of supply and control do not have to study
</p>
<p>dynamic model of induction machine. Such readers could skip entire Chap. 15
</p>
<p>which develops mathematical model and deals with transient processes. The
</p>
<p>steady-state equivalent circuit can be also determined by using analogy with a
</p>
<p>transformer, as shown in Sect. 16.6. The analyses of steady-state equivalent circuits
</p>
<p>and the study of mechanical characteristics of induction machines can be continued
</p>
<p>in Chap. 16.
</p>
<p>1 Phasor is a complex number which represents a sinusoidal AC voltage or current. The absolute
</p>
<p>value of phasor corresponds to the amplitude, while the phasor argument determines the initial
</p>
<p>phase of considered voltages and currents. Phasors can be used to represent other quantities that
</p>
<p>have sinusoidal change in steady state, such as the magnetomotive forces and fluxes.

</p>
<p>1. The effects of distributed parameters are neglected.
</p>
<p>2. The energy of electrical field is neglected along with parasitic capacitances.
</p>
<p>3. The iron losses are neglected.
</p>
<p>4. Magnetic saturation is neglected along with nonlinear B(H) characteristic of
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic materials.
</p>
<p>In the case when a machine has N windings, expression (15.1) contains N
</p>
<p>differential equations of voltage balance, expression (15.2) provides relation
</p>
<p>between the winding currents and their fluxes, expression (15.3) gives the electro-

<p>15.3 Three-Phase and Two-Phase Machines
</p>
<p>Most induction machines have a three-phase stator winding. Stator AC currents
</p>
<p>create the vector of magnetomotive force FS &frac14; Fa &thorn; Fb &thorn; Fc. This vector has a
radial direction within the machine, and it does not have any axial component.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it resides in the plane defined by radial and tangential unit vectors of
</p>
<p>cylindrical coordinate frame. The same plane can be represented by rectangular
</p>
<p>coordinate system of two orthogonal axes, hereafter denoted by a and b. In order to
</p>
<p>represent the vector in the a&ndash;b coordinate system, directions of axes a and b are
</p>
<p>defined by their corresponding unit vectors a0 and b0.
</p>
<p>While the machine has three-phase windings, spatially displaced by 2p/3,
</p>
<p>relevant vector will be displayed in a&ndash;b coordinate system. Therefore, there is a
</p>
<p>need to express the orientation of the magnetic axes of individual phases in terms of
</p>
<p>unit vectors a0 and b0:

<p>the vector which revolves at the speed Oe &frac14; oe and maintains the amplitude
FSm &frac14; 3/2 NIm. Modeling three-phase winding encounters certain difficulties.
One of them is the fact that the phase currents are not independent variables.
</p>
<p>They are restrained by relation ia &thorn; ib &thorn; ic &frac14; 0, which comes from the circum-
stance that the windings are star connected. For delta connection, this problem has
</p>
<p>different nature. Namely, the sum of the phase voltages of delta-connected winding
</p>
<p>is equal to zero. Considering star-connected winding, conclusion is drawn that only
</p>
<p>two out of three stator currents are independent variables. Therefore, in all differ-
</p>
<p>ential equations, the current ic has to be replaced by (�ia�ib), making the equations
clumsy and difficult to work with. In addition, angular displacement between the
</p>
<p>magnetic axis of the phase windings is 2p/3, resulting in nonzero values of mutual
</p>
<p>inductances. An increased number of nonzero elements in the inductance matrix
</p>
<p>increases the number of factors in voltage balance equations, making them more
</p>
<p>involved and less intuitive. On the other hand, hypothetical two-phase machine can
</p>
<p>be envisaged with only two currents and zero mutual inductance. The mathematical
</p>
<p>model of an induction machine is more simple if considered machine has two-phase
</p>
<p>windings on the stator, one of them oriented along unit vector a0 and the other
</p>
<p>oriented along unit vector b0. The stator winding has only two electrical currents, ia
and ib, and they are independent. Due to orthogonal magnetic axes of the windings,
</p>
<p>their mutual inductance is zero, simplifying a great deal the voltage balance
</p>
<p>equations.
</p>
<p>In a two-phase machine with stator windings oriented along unit vectors a0 and
</p>
<p>b0, the mathematical model becomes more usable because the winding currents
</p>
<p>correspond to projections of the magnetomotive force vector on the axes a and b.
</p>
<p>Namely, the magnetomotive force component along the axis a is Fa &frac14; Nia, which
is also projection of the vector FS on axis a. The magnetomotive force component
</p>
<p>along the axis b is Fb &frac14; Nib, equal to projection of the vector FS on axis b. The
same conclusions can be derived for the flux vector. The flux in the phase winding a
</p>
<p>is equal to the projection of the flux vector FS on the axis a. Correspondence
</p>
<p>between the phase quantities and projections of relevant vectors on axes a and b
</p>
<p>facilitates understanding and using the two-phase model.
</p>
<p>One and the same magnetomotive force can be obtained with both three-phase
</p>
<p>and the two-phase windings. The three-phase system of phase windings of Fig. 15.1
</p>
<p>can be replaced by the two-phase system of phase windings, given in Fig. 15.2.
</p>
<p>On the basis of (15.8) and assuming that the number of turns is unchanged
</p>

<p>Thought experiment of removing a three-phase winding from induction

<p>three-phase machine. Consequently, the stator flux vector FS/Rm would be the
</p>
<p>same as well. Moreover, the same flux and speed would result in the same
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque. Namely, in addition to the same flux amplitude and
</p>
<p>speed Oe and with the same rotor speed, the rotor would have the same slip
</p>
<p>frequency, electromotive forces, and currents as the original three-phase machine.
</p>
<p>This thought experiment results in the following conclusion: The operation of
</p>
<p>three-phase induction machine would not change if the three-phase winding is
</p>
<p>replaced by the two-phase winding, provided that the latter provides the same
</p>
<p>stator magnetomotive force. In other words, neither flux nor torque or power of
</p>
<p>the machine is changed by replacing the three-phase winding by the two-phase
</p>
<p>equivalent, provided that the magnetomotive force remains invariant. This con-
</p>
<p>clusion will be used further on.
</p>
<p>Question (15.1): Starting from the described thought experiment, where three-
phase winding system is replaced by two-phase winding system and where the
</p>
<p>number of turns Nabc in each phase of the former is equal to the number of turns Nab
in each phase of the latter, compare the phase voltages of the two. Is it possible to
</p>
<p>make a two-phase equivalent of the original machine that would have different
</p>
<p>voltages and currents? (See Fig. 15.2).
</p>
<p>Answer (15.1): One should recall that the maximum value of the electromotive force
induced in one turn is e1 &frac14; oeFm, while the maximum value of the winding
electromotive force is e &frac14; oeCm, while the voltage balance equation for the phase a
is ua &frac14; Raia &thorn; dCa/dt � dCa/dt &frac14; �oe sin(oet)Cm. Assumption is that both the
original three-phase machine and the equivalent two-phase machine have the same
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force, flux, torque, and power. Therefore, the stator flux is in both cases
</p>
<p>of the same amplitude, and it revolves at the same speed. For that reason, the
</p>
<p>electromotive force induced in one turn is unchanged. Since the number of turns in
</p>
<p>eachphasewinding is the same, the voltagesuabc anduab are of the same amplitude, and
</p>
<p>they have the same rms values. Notice that the ratio u/i changes as the original machine
</p>
<p>is replaced by the equivalent. This ratio has dimension of impedance. Although the
</p>
<p>voltages are proven to be the same, electrical currents iab of the two-phasemachine have
</p>
<p>their amplitude and rms value larger than currents iabc by 50% (see (15.9)).
</p>
<p>Generally, a three-phase stator winding can be replaced by a two-phase stator
</p>
<p>winding with Nab &frac14; mNabc turns. In such cases, phase voltages of the two-phase
equivalent would be uab &frac14; m uabc. The magnetomotive force FS would remain
unaltered provided that electrical currents of the two-phase equivalent are obtained
</p>
<p>according to iab &frac14; (3/2) � (iabc/m). Hence, the right-hand side of (15.9) should be
divided by m.
</p>
<p>* * *
</p>
<p>Although the two-phase equivalent of induction machine is simple, unambiguous,
</p>
<p>and intuitive, induction machines are nevertheless manufactured, deployed, and used
</p>
<p>as three-phasemachines with three-phase windings on the stator. Magnetic axes of the
</p>
<p>stator phases are displaced by 2p/3. There are practical advantages of the three-phase
</p>
<p>systems over the two-phase systems which resulted in the former being widely used.
</p>
<p>15.3 Three-Phase and Two-Phase Machines 385</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Considering the number of conductors required to connect an inductionmachine to the
</p>
<p>grid, a three-phase stator winding gets connected to the mains by three lines (wires).
</p>
<p>The three line-to-line voltages have the same rms value, 0.4 kV for mains supplied
</p>
<p>low-voltage machines. At steady state, each of the three supply lines has the line
</p>
<p>current of the same rms values. The number of conductors in the high-voltage
</p>
<p>transmission lines is also three. Hypothetical two-phase system does not have the
</p>
<p>same advantages.
</p>
<p>Question (15.2): A two-phase induction machine is fed from two voltage sources
having the voltages of the same amplitude, phase shifted by p/2. It is necessary to
</p>
<p>connect these sources to the machine and use only three supply lines (i.e., three
</p>
<p>wires). Determine the voltages between the conductors, and compare the rms values
</p>
<p>of their line currents.
</p>
<p>Answer (15.2): A two-phase machine can be fed from the two voltage sources by
using four wires to connect each end of the two supplies (and there are two of them) to
</p>
<p>the winding terminals a1, a2, b1, and b2 of the two-phase system. It is possible to
</p>
<p>reduce the number of wires (lines) by using one and the same return path for the two
</p>
<p>windings. The two return lines, say a2 and b2, can bemerged and replaced by a single
</p>
<p>line a2b2. Then, the number of conductors can be only three. Yet, in this case, the
</p>
<p>currents in these three lines would not have the same amplitude. The current in the
</p>
<p>return conductor a2b2 is ia(t) &thorn; ib(t) &frac14; (3/2) Im(cosoet &thorn; sinoet). It has 20.5 times
higher amplitude and rms value than the current in remaining two lines. This asym-
</p>
<p>metry exists in line voltages as well. The voltage between the line a1 and the return
</p>
<p>conductor a2b2 corresponds to the phase voltage Ua. The voltage between the line
</p>
<p>b1 and the return conductor a2b2 corresponds to the phase voltage Ub and has the
</p>
<p>same amplitude as the previous one. On the other hand, the voltage between
</p>
<p>conductors a1 and b1 is equal to Ua � Ub, and it has 20.5 times higher amplitude.
* * *
</p>
<p>Uneven voltages and currents in three-wired two-phase systems are one of the
</p>
<p>reasons it never had any wider practical use. The complexity in wiring such system
</p>
<p>is considerable, since the line conductors cannot be exchanged. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>equal voltages and currents of the three-phase, three-wire system make the connec-
</p>
<p>tion process much easier. Connection of the three-phase induction machine to the
</p>
<p>three-phase mains is much easier since all the wires have the same rms value of
</p>
<p>electrical current and the same rms value of their line-to-line voltages. The worst
</p>
<p>consequence of making a random connection is the possibility that the machine
</p>
<p>would rotate in wrong direction.2 Nowadays, all the power lines and distribution
</p>
<p>networks operating with line frequency AC voltages are symmetrical three-phase
</p>
<p>2When this is the case, it is sufficient to exchange any two of the three connections for the machine
</p>
<p>to change direction and revolve correctly. The two line conductors to be exchanged can be
</p>
<p>arbitrarily chosen. It is an understatement that this action must be performed in no voltage
</p>
<p>conditions.

<p>systems. Therefore, even AC machines, such as induction machines and synchro-
</p>
<p>nous machines, are made with three-phase stator windings. For the purposes of
</p>
<p>modeling and analysis, three-phase machines are represented by their two-phase
</p>
<p>equivalent, so as to achieve clear and usable models, equivalent circuits, and other
</p>
<p>mathematical representations of machine.
</p>
<p>15.4 Clarke Transform
</p>
<p>A three-phase machine can be represented by its two-phase equivalent (Fig. 15.3).
</p>
<p>If the two-phase equivalent produces the same magnetomotive force FS as the
</p>
<p>original machine, then the equivalent machine has the same flux, torque, and
</p>
<p>power as the original three-phase machine. Invariant magnetomotive force is
</p>
<p>obtained provided that the two-phase equivalent has the number of turns Nab and
</p>
<p>currents ia(t) and ib(t) that result in the same amplitude and spatial orientation of the
</p>
<p>vector Fs. In cases where Nab &frac14; Nabc, respective stator currents are related by (15.9).
It is not necessary to actually make the two-phase equivalent in order to use the
</p>
<p>benefits of the two-phase model. Instead, mathematical operation similar to (15.9)
</p>
<p>can be applied to all the relevant variables. This operation is, as a matter of fact,
</p>
<p>coordinate transform suited to provide the user with a simple, clear, and intuitive
</p>
<p>model. Relation between the original variables (iabc, uabc, Cabc) and their
</p>
<p>transformed counterparts, the two-phase equivalents (iab, uab, Cab), is called
</p>
<p>coordinate transform, and it is expressed by relations similar to (15.9). In the
</p>
<p>considered case, the three-phase/two-phase transform is applied, named Clarke
</p>
<p>transform after the author.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the actual state of each system subject to analysis or control
</p>
<p>is described by state variables. The set of state variables uniquely defines the state
</p>
<p>of dynamical system. Putting aside the usual approximations, the set of state
</p>
<p>variables provides enough information about the system so as to determine its
</p>
<p>further behavior. A state variable cannot be expressed in terms of other state
</p>
<p>variables. As an example, only two out of the three-phase currents in a three-phase
</p>

</p>
<p>15.4 Clarke Transform 387</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>winding are the actual state variables, as the third one is determined from the sum
</p>
<p>of the other two.
</p>
<p>The benefit of coordinate transform can be demonstrated by a simple example.
</p>
<p>State of an object that moves in three-dimensional space can be described by
</p>
<p>coordinates x, y, and z in the orthogonal Cartesian coordinate system, as well as
</p>
<p>by the fist derivative of these coordinates dx/dt, dy/dt, and dz/dt, representing the
</p>
<p>speed. On the other hand, an observer may have a need to concerning distance r,
</p>
<p>elevation &rsquo;, and azimuth y in spherical coordinate system. Coordinates x, y, and z
can be expressed in terms of spherical coordinate system r, &rsquo;, and y. The function
which translates one set of coordinates into another set is called coordinate trans-
</p>
<p>form. Differential equations of motion can be written by using either the first or the
</p>
<p>second set of coordinates. The first set of equations would be called model in x&ndash;y&ndash;z
</p>
<p>coordinate system, and the second model in spherical coordinate system. Modeling
</p>
<p>the system in Cartesian or spherical coordinate system resembles looking into the
</p>
<p>windowed room through one or the other window. The room remains the same,
</p>
<p>but the image representing the room changes. Generally, selection of another
</p>
<p>coordinate system reflects only the observer viewpoint and does not have any
</p>
<p>impact on the object or system to be modeled. Selection of the appropriate
</p>
<p>coordinate system and corresponding transform of the state variables may have
</p>
<p>significant impact on mathematical model. Such model becomes simple, clear,
</p>
<p>and more intuitive, facilitating decision making regarding control and exploita-
</p>
<p>tion of the system. The model in Cartesian coordinate frame is more suitable when
</p>
<p>modeling an object that moves along the x axis, due to dy/dt &frac14; 0 and dz/dt &frac14; 0.
An attempt to represent the same motion in spherical coordinate frame results in
</p>
<p>rather involved changes in coordinates r, &rsquo;, and y. On the other hand, spherical
coordinate frame is more suited to describe rotation around the origin or radial
</p>
<p>motion. Similarly, a three-phase machine can be represented in the original, three-
</p>
<p>phase domain but also by its equivalent two-phase machine. The latter proves
</p>
<p>more suitable to study machine properties and characteristics and to specify and
</p>
<p>design supplies and controls.
</p>
<p>Electrical currents of the equivalent two-phase system which represents the
</p>
<p>three-phase winding are given by (15.10), which is the matrix form of (15.9).
</p>
<p>The matrix is multiplied by coefficient KI. In the case when the two-phase
</p>
<p>equivalent and the three-phase winding have the same number of turns, the
</p>
<p>value of KI &frac14; 1 is required to secure invariant magnetomotive forces FS. It should
be noted that a three-phase winding can be represented by a two-phase equivalent
</p>
<p>having different number of turns. In such case, for the vector of the stator
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force Fs to remain unchanged, coefficient KImust have a different

<p>The question arises whether the three variables such as ia, ib, and ic can be
</p>
<p>replaced by only two, ias and ibs. Due to ia &thorn; ib &thorn; ic &frac14; 0, only the two-phase
currents of the original machine are independent state variables, which provides the
</p>
<p>rational for the transform expressed by (15.10).
</p>
<p>15.5 Two-Phase Equivalent
</p>
<p>Transform of the state variables of an existing three-phase machine can be understood
</p>
<p>as a thought experiment which represents a three-phase machine by an imagi-
</p>
<p>nary two-phase machine. There is also possibility to actually replace an existing
</p>
<p>three-phase stator winding by a two-phase stator winding that provides the same
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force, flux, torque, and power as the original three-phase
</p>
<p>machine. It is of interest to compare the two induction machines that have the
</p>
<p>same behavior. One of them is the original three-phase machine, and the other is
</p>
<p>the two-phase equivalent. It is assumed that two-phase induction machine, called
</p>
<p>M2, has the same magnetic circuits and the same rotor as the original three-
</p>
<p>phase machine, M3. If the individual phases of M2 and M3 have the same
</p>
<p>number of turns, electrical currents in respective stator windings must corre-
</p>
<p>spond to the following relation:

</p>
<p>so as to provide the same magnetomotive force. With the same magnetomotive
</p>
<p>force and identical magnetic circuits, both machines have the same flux.
</p>
<p>Electromotive force in one turn is proportional to the flux and the angular frequency
</p>
<p>oe. Therefore, each turn in machines M2 and M3 has electromotive force of the
</p>
<p>same amplitude. With Nabc &frac14; Nab, electromotive forces induced in phases a, b, c, a,
and b have the same peak and rms values. With the assumption that the voltage drop
</p>
<p>Ri is negligible with respect to the electromotive force, conclusion is drawn that, in
</p>
<p>the considered case, the phase voltages uabc and uab have the same peak and rms
</p>
<p>values. Specifically, the voltage across the phase a of machine M3 has the same
</p>
<p>peak value as the voltage across the phase a of machine M2. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>considering (15.9), the peak and rms values of the phase currents iab are 3/2 times
</p>
<p>larger with respect to iabc currents. The above-mentioned considerations show that a
</p>
<p>three-phase machine can be converted into a two-phase machine by rewinding the
</p>
<p>stator, yet preserving the same magnetomotive force, flux, torque, and power.
</p>
<p>Maintaining the same number of turns, the phase voltages remain the same, while
</p>
<p>the phase currents increase by factor 3/2.

<p>15.5 Two-Phase Equivalent 389</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Common practice in applying coordinate transforms to electrical machines
</p>
<p>includes applying one and the same transformation formula to all the relevant
</p>
<p>variables, whether voltages, current, or flux linkages. Benefits of this approach
</p>
<p>will be discussed within subsequent chapters. For the example involving machines
</p>
<p>M2 and M3, the transformation matrix for electrical currents is given in (15.11).
</p>
<p>Applying the same formula to voltages, one obtains (15.12) which gives the phase
</p>
<p>voltage uas obtained by using the same three-phase to two-phase transform as the
</p>
<p>one used for currents:

<p>2
� uc
</p>
<p>2
&frac14; 3
</p>
<p>2
ua: (15.12)
</p>
<p>Apparent problem arises from the fact that the actual phase voltage uas of the
</p>
<p>rewound machine M2 does not correspond to the value obtained in (15.12). It
</p>
<p>seems that there is no way to actually make the equivalent two-phase machine
</p>
<p>unless the transformation matrices used for voltages are different than those used
</p>
<p>for currents. Further on, the answer to Question (15.3) proves the opposite. It
</p>
<p>shows that, with the proper choice of KI, it is possible to devise a three-phase to
</p>
<p>two-phase transform that corresponds to two-phase induction machine that can
</p>
<p>actually be made.
</p>
<p>Coordinate transforms do not have to correspond to actual physical systems in
</p>
<p>order to prove their usefulness in modeling. An example is Park transform,
</p>
<p>discussed and used in subsequent chapters, which proves very useful in deriving
</p>
<p>dynamic model and steady-state equivalent circuit and yet results in state variables
</p>
<p>that correspond to virtual electrical machine that cannot be made.
</p>
<p>Considered example includes the three-phase machine M3 which is transformed
</p>
<p>into two-phase equivalent M2. Machines M2 and M3 have identical magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit and the same number of turns per phase. The problem that arises with the
</p>
<p>machine M2 is that it has voltages that do not correspond to those obtained by
</p>
<p>applying the transform matrix (15.14) on the original voltages uabc. Notice that the
</p>
<p>currents are transformed according to (15.10), adopting KI &frac14; 1. Generally, the

</p>
<p>Therefore, with KU &frac14; KI &frac14; 1, the phase voltages and currents obtained by
applying the transform on machine M3 do not correspond to the voltages and
</p>
<p>currents actually measured on machine M2. On the other hand, coefficients KI
and KU do not have to be equal to 1. Other values can be applied as well. The only
</p>
<p>practical restriction is KI &frac14; KU, which maintains the ratio between the voltages and
currents and secures that all the impedances of the original machine retain their
</p>
<p>value after the transformation. Not even this restriction is obligatory, yet it is often
</p>
<p>390 15 Modeling of Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>imposed due to practical reasons. Assuming that the phase current is transformed
</p>
<p>according to (15.10), with KI &frac14; 1, while the voltages are transformed by using
KU &frac14; 2/3, the voltages and currents derived from the transform will correspond to
those measured on two-phase machine M2 which has the same number of turns per
</p>
<p>phase as three-phase original M3. Drawback of this approach is that the ratio of
</p>
<p>voltage and current of machines M2 and M3 will not be the same. Thus, proposed
</p>
<p>transform will affect the impedances. They will not be invariant. Parameter RS of
</p>
<p>the three-phase machine would have to be multiplied by 2/3 in order to get the
</p>
<p>parameter RS of the two-phase machine. Generally, impedances of the original
</p>
<p>three-phase machine should be multiplied by KU/KI in order to obtain impedances
</p>
<p>of the two-phase equivalent.
</p>
<p>Up to now, discussion was focused on devising a 3-phase to 2-phase transform
</p>
<p>that corresponds to physical prototypes M2 and M3. In general, transformed
</p>
<p>quantities can but do not have to correspond to a practical two-phase machine. It
</p>
<p>is acceptable to adopt KI &frac14; 1 and KU &frac14; 1 and obtain correct mathematical model.
This transform does provide the voltages that can be measured on M2, but it has the
</p>
<p>advantage of being impedance invariant. On the other hand, transform with KI &frac14; 1
and KU &frac14; 1 is not invariant in terms of power, namely, Pabc 6&frac14; Pab. Nonetheless,
such model can be advantageously used. The lack of power invariance has to be
</p>
<p>kept in mind and taken care of.
</p>
<p>Three-phase to two-phase transform with KI &frac14; KU &frac14; 2/3 is frequently encoun-
tered. It is impedance invariant, but it brings in the relation Pabc &frac14; 3/2 Pab. For
better understanding, before listing the properties of Clarke transform, the values of
</p>
<p>frequently used coefficients KI and KU will be described in brief.
</p>
<p>15.6 Invariance
</p>
<p>If Clarke transform preserves the ratio between voltages and currents of the three-
</p>
<p>phase original and the two-phase equivalent, it is invariant in terms of impedance. If
</p>
<p>the ratio between fluxes and currents remains the same, the transform is invariant in
</p>
<p>terms of inductance. If the expression for power Pab of the two-phase equivalent
</p>
<p>corresponds to the power of the original three-phase machine, then the transform is
</p>
<p>invariant in terms of power.
</p>
<p>It is necessary to point out that transforms which are not power invariant can be
</p>
<p>advantageously used, provided that the user of mathematical model respects the
</p>
<p>ratio Pabc &frac14; K�Pab.
First-time user of coordinate transforms may nurture doubts whether the mathe-
</p>
<p>matical model is correct, considering that it calculates apparently incorrect power
</p>
<p>due to Pabc 6&frac14; Pab. To resolve such doubts, it is important to recall that the state
variables obtained by using coordinate transform do not have to correspond to any
</p>
<p>machine that could be actually made. However, this does not minimize practical
</p>
<p>values of the mathematical model. As an example, one can start with mathematical
</p>
<p>model of a simple resistor, u &frac14; Ri. By performing coordinate transform u1 &frac14; 2u
</p>
<p>15.6 Invariance 391</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and i1 &frac14; 2i, one obtains the model having electrical power four times higher than
the actual resistor. However, this model is still useful. Given the current, one can
</p>
<p>calculate the voltage according to u1 &frac14; Ri1. The user should recall the power
invariance and calculate the actual power as u1i1/4. Representation of u1, i1 of a
</p>
<p>resistor does not represent real resistor, but it stands as a usable model.
</p>
<p>Most practical uses of Clarke transform retain the impedance invariance and the
</p>
<p>inductance invariance, while the lack of power invariance is often acceptable. This
</p>
<p>means that transforms of the currents, voltages, and fluxes are carried out by using
</p>
<p>the same transform matrix for all the variables. The transformation matrix is given
</p>
<p>in (15.13), while the coefficients for voltage and flux transform are given by

: (15.13)
</p>
<p>It is of interest to use (15.13) with KI &frac14; 1 and derive the phase currents of the
two-phase equivalent having the same number of turns (Nab &frac14; Nabc) as the three-
phase original. The three-phase winding with symmetrical set of phase currents
</p>
<p>ia(t) &frac14; Imcosoet, ib(t) &frac14; Imcos(oet &ndash; 2p/3), and ic(t) &frac14; Im cos(oet &ndash; 4p/3) can be
transformed by using KI &frac14; 1 and (15.13). The two-phase equivalent is obtained
with ia(t) &frac14; ia(t) � ib(t)/2 � ic(t)/2 &frac14; 3/2 Imcosoet and ib(t) &frac14; 30.5/2�(ib(t) �
ic(t)) &frac14; 3/2 Imsinoet. Hence, the two-phase equivalent has phase currents shifted
by p/2, which corresponds to the spatial shift between magnetic axes of
</p>
<p>corresponding windings.
</p>
<p>In addition to the phase currents, the voltages and fluxes should also be

<p>In general, coefficients KU and KC in the above expressions can be arbitrarily
</p>
<p>selected and do not have to be equal to KI. The choice KI &frac14; KU &frac14; KC has the
advantages that contribute to legibility and usability of mathematical model that
</p>
<p>results from transforms.
</p>
<p>392 15 Modeling of Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Selecting KI &frac14; KU, one obtains impedance invariant Clarke transform. Namely,
all the resistances, impedances, and other accounts where the ratio u/i appears
</p>
<p>remain unaltered by the transform. Hence, parameters such as RS retain their
</p>
<p>value even in ab coordinate frame. Deciding otherwise would create the need to
</p>
<p>scale all the impedances by the ratio KU/KI.
</p>
<p>Selection KI &frac14; KC results in inductance invariant Clarke transform. The self-
inductances, mutual inductances, and leakage inductances of all the windings
</p>
<p>remain unaltered by the transform. Hence, deciding otherwise would create the
</p>
<p>need to scale all the inductances by the ratio KC/KI.
</p>
<p>Selection KU &frac14; KC, relation between electromotive forces and fluxes, remains
e &frac14; dC/dt. Deciding otherwise would require the two-phase model to include
relations such as e &frac14; (KU/KC) dC/dt.
</p>
<p>Throughout this book, it is assumed that KI &frac14; KU &frac14; KC. Other choices are
rarely met in reference literature. They result in mathematical models that are
</p>
<p>correct but more difficult to use than the models obtained by invariant transform.
</p>
<p>The freedom of choice is often a problem. An example to that is the attempt to
</p>
<p>replace the original three-phase machine M3 by actual two-phase prototype M2,
</p>
<p>already discussed before. Considered is the case where the phase windings of both
</p>
<p>M3 andM2 have the same number of turns per phase,Nab &frac14; Nabc. Clarke transform
of the three voltages (ua, ub, uc) calculates the values (ua, ub) of the two-phase
</p>
<p>equivalent. In order to obtain the values of (ua, ub) that correspond to voltages
</p>
<p>actually measured on the machineM2, the coefficient KU has to be equal to 2/3. This
</p>
<p>conclusion is already explained, and it relies on the fact that both machines have the
</p>
<p>same amplitude of electromotive forces induced in single turn. Due to Nab &frac14; Nabc,
the phase windings of machines M2 and M3 have the same amplitudes of winding
</p>
<p>electromotive forces. With e � u, the same holds for the phase voltages as well.
Hence, for the Clarke transform to provide the same voltages (ua, ub) and currents
</p>
<p>(ia, ib) as the actual prototype M2, with Nab &frac14; Nabc, it is necessary to use KU &frac14; 2/3
and KI &frac14; 1. Correspondence between the obtained two-phase equivalent and the
actual machine M2 increases the user confidence. However, there are problems
</p>
<p>created by the choice KI 6&frac14; KU. The use of different transforms for voltages and
currents leads to different ratios u/i in abc and ab coordinate systems. In other words,
</p>
<p>transform is not impedance invariant. Parameters such as resistance R or reactance X
</p>
<p>have different values in abc and ab frames. Any transition from abc to ab frame
</p>
<p>requires impedances to be scaled by 3/2. This does not mean that the model is
</p>
<p>inaccurate, but it compromises clarity and augments the chances of making errors.
</p>
<p>Previous discussion demonstrates that the choice KU &frac14; 2/3 and KI &frac14; 1 results in
Clarke transform that provides two-phase voltage and currents in full correspon-
</p>
<p>dence with the actual two-phase machine M2. Yet, such transform is not impedance
</p>
<p>invariant, and it brings difficulties in using the model. For that reason, decision
</p>
<p>KI &frac14; KU &frac14; KC is used throughout this book, although it does not correspond to
voltages and currents of the machine M2.
</p>
<p>As a rule, while selecting transform of the state variables, it is considered that
</p>
<p>resistances (R) and inductances (L) should stay invariant. Therefore, invariability of
</p>
<p>impedances and inductances is set as a prerequisite. In other words, legibility and
</p>
<p>15.6 Invariance 393</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>usability of the model are considered more important than similarity to the actual
</p>
<p>two-phase prototype M2.
</p>
<p>In the analysis and modeling of electrical machines, all the transforms of the
</p>
<p>state variables are made so as to maintain the ratio of voltages, currents, and fluxes.
</p>
<p>In this way, transforms are impedance invariant and inductance invariant.
</p>
<p>&bull; The same voltage and current transform matrices result impedance invariability.
</p>
<p>&bull; The same flux and current transform matrices result in invariable self-
</p>
<p>inductances, mutual inductances, and leakage inductance.
</p>
<p>&bull; The same voltage and flux transform matrices maintain relation e &frac14; dC/dt. With
KU 6&frac14; KC, this relation becomes relation e &frac14; (KU/KC) dC/dt.
</p>
<p>Question (15.3): Is it possible to make an actual two-phase machine with Nab &frac14;
mNabc turns which has the same stator magnetomotive force Fs as the original three-
</p>
<p>phase machine and which has, at the same time, the voltages, currents, and fluxes
</p>
<p>which correspond to values obtained by Clarke transform performed with
</p>
<p>KU &frac14; KI &frac14; KC?
Answer (15.3): The actual two-phase equivalent of the original three-phase
machine must have the same magnetomotive force, flux, torque, and power as
</p>
<p>the original machine. A three-phase stator winding can be replaced by a two-
</p>
<p>phase winding having Nab &frac14; mNabc turns. Invariability of Fs requires that windings
of the two-phase equivalent carry currents iab &frac14; (3/2)�(iabc/m). At the same time,
the two-phase equivalent has the same electromotive force in a single turn and m
</p>
<p>times more turns per phase. Therefore, the phase voltages of the two-phase equiva-
</p>
<p>lent will be uab &frac14; muabc. Finally, with KU &frac14; KI, the ratio of voltages and currents
of the original machine (uabc/iabc) is equal to the ratio of voltages and currents of the
</p>
<p>two-phase equivalent (uab/iab). Summarizing the above statements,

</p>
<p>Hence, when three-phase machine is replaced by two-phase equivalent which

<p>has (3/2)0.5 times more turns per phase, the voltages and currents of the actual two-
</p>
<p>phase machine correspond to these obtained from the Clarke transform performed
</p>
<p>with leading coefficient of (2/3)0.5. This Clarke transform calculates the voltages,
</p>
<p>currents, and fluxes in ab domain by applying the same transformation matrices to
</p>
<p>the original voltages, currents, and fluxes in the abc domain. Hence, KU &frac14; KI &frac14;
KC &frac14; (2/3)0.5. This transform is invariant in terms of impedance, inductance,
magnetomotive force, torque, and power. The amplitude of fluxes in windings a

<p>and b, the amplitudes and rms values of corresponding voltages, and the amplitudes
</p>
<p>and rms values of currents are (3/2)0.5 times higher compared to the original

<p>394 15 Modeling of Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is the reason to avoid the Clarke transform with coefficient K &frac14; (2/3)0.5, notwith-

</p>
<p>Question (15.4): Prove that Clarke transform with KU &frac14; KI &frac14; KC &frac14; (2/3)0.5 is
invariant in terms of power.
</p>
<p>Answer (15.4): Without lack of generality, it is possible to assume that the
machine operates in steady state. Electrical power in each phase winding can be
</p>
<p>calculated as product of rms values of winding current, voltage, and power factor.
</p>
<p>For purposes of proving the power invariance, the latter can be considered constant
</p>
<p>or even equal to 1. Total power of the machine is obtained as the sum of individual
</p>
<p>phase powers. Consider a three-phase machine with rms values of the phase
</p>
<p>voltages and currents Uabc and Iabc; electrical power of the three-phase machine
</p>
<p>is found to be 3 UabcIabc. By applying Clarke transform with coefficients KU &frac14; KI
&frac14; KC &frac14; (2/3)0.5, one obtains currents and voltages in ab domain with amplitudes
(3/2)0.5 times higher. Therefore, the phase a power is equal to [(3/2)0.5Uabc]�[(3/
2)0.5Iabc] &frac14; 3/2 UabcIabc. The same power is obtained in phase b, resulting in total
power of 3UabcIabc, which confirms invariability in terms of power.
</p>
<p>Question (15.5): Prove that the application of Clarke transform with KU &frac14; KI &frac14;
KC &frac14; 1 is not invariant in terms of power but results in Pab &frac14; (3/2)Pabc.
Answer (15.5): Assume that voltages and currents of the three-phase machine are
known and equal to ua, ub, uc, ia, ib, and ic. By using expression (15.13) for the
</p>
<p>three-phase/two-phase transform, it is required to determine variables ua, ub, ia, and
</p>
<p>ib. By replacing the corresponding variables from the original abc domain in
</p>
<p>equation Pab &frac14; ua ia &thorn; ub ib, one obtains that Pab &frac14; (3/2)Pabc.
</p>
<p>15.6.1 Clarke Transform with K= 1
</p>
<p>In the case when KU &frac14; KI &frac14; KC &frac14; 1, the two-phase equivalent machine should
have the same number of turns in order to provide the same magnetomotive force.
</p>
<p>Transformed variables include 3/2 times larger amplitudes of voltages and currents.

<p>15.7 Equivalent Two-Phase Winding
</p>
<p>Preceding sections summarize the needs for representing a three-phase machine by
</p>
<p>its two-phase equivalent. Clarke 3F/2F transform is introduced and explained. The
</p>
<p>choice of transform coefficients is discussed, along with consequences in terms of
</p>
<p>impedance, inductance, and power invariance of the transform. In further analysis,
</p>
<p>the following 3F/2F transform is adopted and used.
</p>
<p>Clarke 3F/2F transform of voltages, currents, and fluxes is performed in a
</p>
<p>unified way, by using the same transform matrix for all the variables having the
</p>
<p>leading coefficient of K &frac14; 2/3. The symbol V in the expression (15.27) represents
voltage, current, or flux in one phase winding:

</p>
<p>As a consequence, the applied transform is invariant in terms of impedances and
</p>
<p>inductances. Therefore, parameters such as RS, RR, Lm, LS, and all other inductances
</p>
<p>and resistances retain their original values.
</p>
<p>The peak and rms values of variables in ab frame are equal to the peak and rms
</p>
<p>values of original abc variables. Identities ua(t) � ua(t), ia(t) � ia(t), and Ca(t) �
Ca(t) apply too.
</p>
<p>Selected transform with K &frac14; 2/3 provides ab variables that cannot be
reproduced by any actual two-phase prototype. Namely, it is not possible to make
</p>
<p>an actual two-phase stator winding which replaces the three-phase winding,
</p>
<p>provides the magnetomotive force, and has the stator voltages and currents which
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>correspond to the values obtained by the transform. Invariability of Fs requires
</p>
<p>Nab &frac14; 3/2 Nabc, which leads to uab &frac14; 3/2 uabc, owing to equal electromotive forces
induced in one turn. On the other hand, selected transform results in uab &frac14; uabc.
</p>
<p>Power of the two-phase equivalent Pab &frac14; uaia &thorn; ubib is equal to 2/3Pabc.
Namely, since phase quantities in ab domain have the same values as the original
</p>
<p>counterparts in abc domain, the power per phase is equal, resulting in Pab &frac14; 2/3
Pabc. While using the model, it should be recalled that numerical value Pab &frac14; uaia
&thorn; ubib should be multiplied by 3/2 in order to get the power of the original three-
phase machine. Therefore,
</p>
<p>Pabc &frac14;

Pab: (15.28)
</p>
<p>The question arises whether the model in ab frame with Pab &frac14; 2/3Pabc stands as
an adequate representation of the induction machine having 3/2 larger power. It has
</p>
<p>to be recalled that the coordinate transforms result in a mathematical model with
</p>
<p>variables that do not necessarily correspond to any actual machine. Any attempt to
</p>
<p>envisage a practical two-phase equivalent and to interpret the variables ua, ia, ub,
</p>
<p>and ib as voltages and currents of practical a and b windings may be helpful in
</p>
<p>understanding and using the model. Yet, the virtual machine in ab frame is actually
</p>
<p>a mathematical fiction, and therefore, relations such as Pab &frac14; 2/3Pabc do not
invalidate the model. Recall that any resistor with voltage u and current i can be
</p>
<p>represented by mathematical model u1 &frac14; Ri1, where the new voltage and current
are obtained by coordinate transform u1 &frac14; 2u and i1 &frac14; 2i. The model has electrical
power 4 times larger than the actual resistor and been used to represent the basic
</p>
<p>properties of the resistor. Due to lack of the power invariance of the transform
</p>
<p>V1 &frac14; 2 V, the user should recall to calculate the actual power as u1i1/4.
</p>
<p>15.8 Model of Stator Windings
</p>
<p>By applying Clarke transform, a three-phase machine can be represented by a two-
</p>
<p>phase equivalent. Axes of virtual phase windings aS and bS are still with respect to
</p>
<p>the stator. The axis aS is collinear with the magnetic axis of the phase winding a of
</p>
<p>the original machine. The model where the currents, voltages, and fluxes of the
</p>
<p>stator are represented by their aS and bS components is called model in stationary
</p>
<p>coordinate frame. Given the voltage, current, and flux vectors of the stator winding,
</p>
<p>their aS and bS components can be found as projections of relevant vectors on the
</p>
<p>axes of aS-bS coordinate frame.
</p>
<p>Figure 15.4 shows an induction machine represented by a two-phase stator
</p>
<p>winding and a two-phase rotor winding. Angle ym represents the rotor position,

<p>Omdt: (15.29)
</p>
<p>By reducing the three-phase stator to the two-phase equivalence, the model
</p>
<p>obtains two virtual stator windings, aS and bS, which create the magnetomotive
</p>
<p>force and flux along axes aS and bS of the still coordinate system called stationary or
</p>
<p>stator coordinate system. Currents and voltages of these windings are denoted by
</p>
<p>uaS, ubS, iaS, and ibS, in order to distinguish them from the rotor variables which are
</p>
<p>introduced later and which make use of subscript R.
</p>
<p>Question (15.6): Direction and amplitude of the vector of magnetomotive force of
the stator Fs are known. Determine currents iaS and ibS.
</p>
<p>Answer (15.6): The required currents are determined by projections of vector Fs
on axes aS and bS of the still coordinate system.
</p>
<p>15.9 Voltage Balance Equations
</p>
<p>Voltage equilibrium in three-phase winding is given by expressions comprising
</p>
<p>phase voltages ua, ub, and uc; phase currents ia, ib, and ic; and total flux linkages of
</p>
<p>the phase windings Ca, Cb, and Cc. The flux Ca in the phase winding a has
</p>
<p>component LSia, produced by the current in the same winding. Coefficient LS is
</p>
<p>the self-inductance of the stator winding. Other windings on stator and rotor may
</p>
<p>contribute to the fluxCa. Their contribution is proportional to electrical currents in
</p>
<p>those windings and also to the coefficient of mutual inductance. For winding
</p>
<p>denoted by x, the flux contribution is Laxix, where Lax is mutual inductance between
</p>
<p>the phase winding a and the winding x, while ix is the corresponding current. Phase
</p>
<p>windings have the same number of turns, the same resistance Ra &frac14; Rb &frac14; Rc &frac14; RS,

<p>and the same coefficients of self-inductance La &frac14; Lb &frac14; Lc &frac14; LS. For any windings,

</p>
<p>By applying Clarke transform which uses the same transformation matrix for the
</p>
<p>voltages, currents, and fluxes, the voltage balance equations can be transferred to
</p>
<p>aS&ndash;bS coordinate frame and expressed in terms of aS and bS projections of the
</p>
<p>voltage, current, and flux vectors. Quantities CaS and CbS are projections of
</p>
<p>the stator flux vector on axes aS and bS. They can be calculated by applying the
</p>
<p>three-phase/two-phase transform to the total fluxes of the phase windings Ca, Cb,
</p>
<p>andCc. Moreover, the transformation matrix can be applied to the whole right side
</p>
<p>of (15.30), obtaining in this way:

<p>uaS &frac14; RSiaS &thorn; dCaS=dt;

</p>
<p>The above equation represents the voltage equilibrium in the two-phase equiva-
</p>
<p>lent of the stator winding. In addition to modeling the stator, it is required to model
</p>
<p>the short-circuited rotor cage. Voltage equilibrium equations in the rotor circuit will
</p>
<p>complete the model of the electrical subsystem of the induction machine.
</p>
<p>15.10 Modeling Rotor Cage
</p>
<p>The rotor cage contains a relatively large number of conductors which are short
</p>
<p>circuited by the front and rear rings. An example of the rotor cage separated from the
</p>
<p>rotor magnetic circuit is shown in Fig. 15.5a. For rotor cage with NR &frac14; 28
conductors, it is possible to identify 14 short-circuited turns, each created by one
</p>
<p>pair of diametrically positioned conductors. Therefore, it is possible tomake amodel
</p>
<p>of the rotor comprising 14 short-circuited turns with mutual magnetic coupling, also
</p>
<p>coupled with aS and bS stator windings, as shown in Fig. 15.5b. However, such
</p>
<p>model would be of little practical value. Its inductance matrix will have dimensions
</p>
<p>16 � 16. Therefore, another approach is needed to model the rotor cage.
As the first step, it is of interest to observe the part (c) in Fig. 15.5 and assume
</p>
<p>that the rotor flux pulsates along the vertical axis. At this point, it is of interest to
</p>
<p>400 15 Modeling of Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>derive a model of the rotor cage that would reflect the induction of the rotor
</p>
<p>electromotive forces and currents in this particular case. The rotor conductors can
</p>
<p>be considered as a set of turns where the conductors making one turn are positioned
</p>
<p>symmetrical with respect to the vertical axis, as shown in Fig. 15.5c. With the
</p>
<p>assumption that pairs of rotor conductors which constitute one turn reside on the
</p>
<p>same horizontal line, and also assuming that there are no other connections between
</p>
<p>the turns, electrical currents in such turns would create the rotor flux along vertical
</p>
<p>axis. Under assumptions, they cannot make any flux in horizontal direction. There-
</p>
<p>fore, such rotor windings can be denoted by the symbol of coil placed on the vertical
</p>
<p>axis, as indicated in Fig. 15.5. This symbol represents the rotor turns that can be
</p>
<p>envisaged as one short-circuited rotor phase with vertical magnetic axis. For the
</p>
<p>time being, this approach overlooks the circumstance that the front and rear rings
</p>
<p>make a short circuit for all conductors. Assuming that an external stator flux
</p>
<p>pulsates along vertical axis, the flux within individual rotor turns would change,
</p>
<p>resulting in electromotive forces and consequential currents in short-circuited rotor
</p>
<p>turns. This thought experiment proved that the rotor winding connected according
</p>
<p>to the part (c) in Fig. 15.5 provides the short-circuiting effect of the rotor cage for
</p>
<p>vertical pulsations of the external flux. The rotor currents induced due to changes in
</p>
<p>the external flux act toward suppressing the flux changes. Namely, they contribute
</p>
<p>to the rotor flux in the direction opposite to the original flux change.
</p>
<p>However, the same setup cannot represent the short-circuiting effect of the rotor cage
</p>
<p>in caseswhere the changes of the external fluxhave their horizontal component. For flux
</p>
<p>pulsations along horizontal direction, there are no induced electromotive forces and no
</p>
<p>rotor currents since the only phase winding of the rotor has vertical magnetic axis.
</p>
<p>Hence, it does not react to changes in horizontal flux component. Recall that the setup in
</p>
<p>Fig. 15.5c reacts only to changes in vertical component of the flux. Therefore, the rotor
</p>
<p>model comprising only one short-circuited phase winding cannot serve as an accurate
</p>
<p>representation of phenomena occurring in short-circuited rotor cage.
</p>
<p>An actual rotor cage which is short circuited by the front and rare conductive
</p>
<p>rings exhibits its short-circuiting effects in arbitrary direction. As a matter of fact,
</p>
<p>Fig. 15.5 Modeling the rotor cage
</p>
<p>15.10 Modeling Rotor Cage 401</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the end rings provide the short circuit between all the rotor bars and make a short-
</p>
<p>circuited turnout of any pair of rotor bars. Thus, variation of the external flux in any
</p>
<p>arbitrary orientation induces electromotive forces and currents in rotor turns that
</p>
<p>have their magnetic axis aligned with the vector of the flux change. The rotor cage
</p>
<p>is symmetrical, and it has a number of conductors. For this reason, the cage can be
</p>
<p>modeled as a three-phase winding, with individual rotor phases being short
</p>
<p>circuited and shifted by 2p/3, as shown in Fig. 15.6a. It is also possible to model
</p>
<p>the rotor as a two-phase, short-circuited winding, as shown in Fig. 15.6b. Validity
</p>
<p>of the two-phase model of the rotor cage can be verified by considering an arbitrary
</p>
<p>variation of the flux and analyzing the rotor reaction. Variation of the external flux
</p>
<p>with an arbitrary orientation can be represented by two orthogonal flux components
</p>
<p>lying along horizontal and vertical axis, which correspond to magnetic axis of the
</p>
<p>representative two-phase winding. Since parameters like resistance and inductance
</p>
<p>of the phase windings are identical, the short-circuiting effect of the rotor is the
</p>
<p>same for both flux components. In both horizontal and vertical axis, the rotor reacts
</p>
<p>to the flux changes by induced electromotive forces and consequential rotor
</p>
<p>currents. Hence, the two-phase representation of the short-circuited cage provides
</p>
<p>the model of the rotor reaction which does not depend on spatial orientation of the
</p>
<p>external flux changes. Therefore, two-phase representation of short-circuited rotor
</p>
<p>cage is an adequate model of the rotor winding, whatever the number of rotor
</p>
<p>conductors, provided that all the conductors are the same and that they are equally
</p>
<p>spaced around the rotor circumference.3
</p>
<p>In the course of rotor motion, the rotor changes its position ymwith respect to the
</p>
<p>stator. Therefore, magnetic axes of the two-phase rotor winding change their
</p>
<p>relative positions with respect to magnetic axes of the stator winding. In
</p>
<p>Fig. 15.6 Three-phase rotor cage and its two-phase equivalent
</p>
<p>3The rotor winding cannot be represented by two-phase equivalent in cases when the rotor cage is
</p>
<p>damaged. If one or more conductors are broken or disconnected from the short-circuiting rings, the
</p>
<p>rotor reaction to flux changes will be different in some directions. These cases are out of the scope
</p>
<p>of this book.

<p>Fig. 15.4, the rotor axes are denoted by aR and bR. The voltages in short-circuited
</p>
<p>phases of the rotor are equal to zero; hence, uaR &frac14; ubR &frac14; 0. The rotor currents iaR
and ibR represent electrical currents induced in the rotor cage, and they create the
</p>
<p>rotor magnetomotive force FR whose amplitude and direction depend on currents
</p>
<p>iaR and ibR but also on the rotor position ym. In the case when iaR &gt; 0 and ibR &frac14; 0,
the vector FR lies along aR axis. For a given vector FR, currents of the two-phase
</p>
<p>model of the rotor cage can be determined from projections of this vector on the
</p>
<p>rotor axes aR and bR. The coefficient of proportionality between these currents and
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force is determined by the number of turns of the two-phase model
</p>
<p>of the rotor cage. The rotor phases aR and bR are virtual phases, that is, they are
</p>
<p>mathematical fiction that represent the rotor cage. Therefore, the number of turns of
</p>
<p>such virtual windings can be arbitrarily chosen. It should be noted that the short-
</p>
<p>circuiting effect of the rotor cage can be modeled by two-phase equivalent with
</p>
<p>large number of turns made comprising conductors with a lower cross section but
</p>
<p>also with lower number of turns made of conductors with larger cross section, even
</p>
<p>with NR &frac14; 1. The original cage is aluminum cast, and it has one conductor per slot.
For convenience, it is frequently assumed that the two-phase equivalent winding
</p>
<p>representing the rotor has the same number of turns as the stator phases. In this
</p>
<p>manner, transformation of rotor variables to the stator side is implied, and all the
</p>
<p>rotor variables and parameters that appear in the model are already scaled by the
</p>
<p>appropriate transformation ratio NS/NR.
</p>
<p>15.11 Voltage Balance Equations in Rotor Winding
</p>
<p>Two-phase representation of the stator and rotor windings reduces the mathematical
</p>
<p>model of the electrical subsystem of an induction machine to a set of four coupled

<p>phase windings. One pair of phase winding resides on the stator and the other pair

where u, R, i, and C denote the voltage across terminals of the considered phase

<p>15.12 Inductance Matrix
</p>
<p>Electrical subsystem of an inductionmachine is described by 4 differential equations
</p>
<p>of voltage balance comprising 4 currents and 4 fluxes. Among these 8 variables,
</p>
<p>there are only 4 state variables. Namely, if electrical currents iaS, ibS, iaR, and ibR are
</p>
<p>promoted to the state variables, then the 4 fluxes CaS, CbS, CaR, and CbR can be
</p>
<p>expressed in terms of currents. Relation between the fluxes and currents is generally
</p>
<p>nonlinear, due to nonlinearity of ferromagnetic materials and magnetic saturations.
</p>
<p>Under assumptions adopted in modeling electrical machines, which include the
</p>
<p>assumption that ferromagnetic materials have linear B-H characteristic, the flux
</p>
<p>linkages and electrical currents are in linear relation, defined by the inductance
</p>
<p>matrix. For the induction machine under consideration, the inductance matrix is
</p>
<p>given by expression (15.33). Along themain diagonal of the inductancematrix, there
</p>
<p>are coefficients of self-inductances of the phase windings. Coefficient L11 &frac14; LS is
self-inductance of the stator winding aS. Given the magnetic resistance Rm of the
</p>
<p>stator flux circuit and the number of turns NS, self-inductance of the stator can be
</p>
<p>determined as L11 &frac14; L22 &frac14; LS &frac14; NS2/Rm. The stator phases have the same number
of turns. At the same time, the air gap does not change along the machine circum-
</p>
<p>ference, and therefore, the magnetic resistance is also the same. For that reason, both
</p>
<p>stator phases have the same self-inductance LS. Coefficients L33 &frac14; L44 &frac14; LR are
self-inductances of rotor phases aR and bR. Assuming that the rotor phase windings
</p>
<p>have the same number of turns as the stator phase windings, the difference in LS and
</p>
<p>LR depends on magnetic resistances encountered by the stator and rotor flux
</p>
<p>linkages. The field lines of the rotor flux pass through the same air gap as the lines
</p>
<p>of the stator flux. Therefore, magnetic resistance to the stator flux is approximately
</p>
<p>equal to the magnetic resistance to the rotor flux. Small difference between LS and LR
can be seen due to different leakage flux path and different leakage inductances:

<p>15.14 Magnetic Coupling
</p>
<p>Leakage flux of the stator and leakage flux of the rotor exist in different magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits, and they may have different magnetic resistances. For that reason, even the
</p>
<p>leakage inductances can be different.
</p>
<p>Gross part of the stator flux encircles both stator and rotor windings, but there are
</p>
<p>also some lines of magnetic field that encircle only the stator conductors. They do
</p>
<p>not cross the air gap and thus do not encircle the rotor conductors. These field lines
</p>
<p>belong to the leakage flux of the stator. Leakage flux of the stator is a smaller part of
</p>
<p>the stator flux FS &frac14; (LSiS)/NS. Leakage flux of the rotor is defined in similar.
Different shapes of the stator and rotor slots as well as differences in the shape
</p>
<p>and cross section of conductors may result in different magnetic resistances on the
</p>
<p>path of the stator and rotor leakage fluxes.
</p>
<p>406 15 Modeling of Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Magnetic resistance encountered on the path of the mutual flux is one and the
</p>
<p>same for both stator and rotor phase windings. In both cases, mutual flux passes
</p>
<p>through the air gap, where the gross part of the magnetic resistance is encountered.
</p>
<p>Besides, mutual flux encircles both stator and rotor windings, passing through teeth,
</p>
<p>yoke, and other parts of stator and rotor magnetic circuits. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>magnetic resistance encountered along the path of leakage flux component is likely
</p>
<p>to be different on stator and rotor. Namely, the leakage flux path includes the width
</p>
<p>of the slots, and these are likely to be different. In general, a narrower slot opening
</p>
<p>results in a smaller magnetic resistance for the leakage flux and a larger leakage
</p>
<p>inductance, while a wide slot opening leads to a small leakage inductance.
</p>
<p>In electrical machines, the power of electromechanical conversion and the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque depend on the magnetic coupling between the stator and
</p>
<p>rotor windings. Better coupling leads to more torque and power, hence the intention
</p>
<p>to keep the leakage as low as possible. Ideally, the coefficient of magnetic coupling
</p>
<p>of the stator and rotor k &frac14; Lm/(LSLR)0,5 should reach unity. The leakage flux is
proportional to difference 1 � k, and in this case, it reaches zero as well as the
leakage inductance coefficients LgS and LgR. Practical machines cannot be designed
</p>
<p>to achieve the coupling coefficient of 1. Such a coupling would require the
</p>
<p>conductors of the two windings to be next to each other, so as to prevent any
</p>
<p>leakage flux, and this is not feasible due to practical reasons. The stator and rotor
</p>
<p>have to be separated by air gap for mechanical and electrical reasons. In machines
</p>
<p>designed for operation with higher voltages, insulation of individual conductors and
</p>
<p>windings has to sustain high-voltage stresses. For this reason, insulation layers are
</p>
<p>thicker, as well as distances between individual conductors. With increased
</p>
<p>distances between corresponding conductors, the space for the leakage flux is
</p>
<p>enlarged as well as the leakage flux. Provisional values of the coupling coefficient
</p>
<p>in low-voltage electrical machines (400 V, 50 Hz) are k ~ [0.9 .. 0.98]. In machines
</p>
<p>designed to operate with high voltages, the values of the coupling coefficient could
</p>
<p>be considerably lower, even k &lt; 0.9.
</p>
<p>15.15 Matrix L
</p>
<p>Inductance matrix provides the link between the vector column with four total flux
</p>
<p>linkages and the vector column with four electrical currents. On the main diagonal,
</p>
<p>inductance matrix has the coefficients of self-inductances. Off the main diagonal, it
</p>
<p>has the mutual inductances. The mutual inductances describing magnetic coupling
</p>
<p>between stator and rotor phases are variable. They change in the course of motion.
</p>
<p>Neglecting the differences in magnetic resistances for stator and rotor flux
</p>
<p>linkages, the ratio LS/LR depends on the number of stator and rotor turns, L11 &frac14; L22
&frac14; LS &frac14; NS2/Rm, L33 &frac14; L44 &frac14; LR &frac14; NR2/Rm. Self-inductances are strictly positive,
while mutual inductances may assume negative values as well as positive. Mutual
</p>
<p>inductance Ljk determines the flux contribution brought into the phase winding k by
</p>
<p>15.15 Matrix L 407</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the current ij of the phase winding j. Magnetic coupling between the two windings is
</p>
<p>reciprocal, Ljk &frac14; Lkj; thus, the inductance matrix is symmetrical (L &frac14; LT). Mutual
inductance of orthogonal windings is equal to zero4; thus, L12 &frac14; L21 &frac14; L34 &frac14; L43
&frac14; 0. Coefficient L13 of the matrix represents mutual inductance of windings aS and
aR. Relative position of the considered windings changes as the rotor moves. With
</p>
<p>ym &frac14; 0, the windings are placed one against the other, and their magnetic axes
coincide. In this position, magnetic coupling peaks, and then current in one winding
</p>
<p>gives the highest change of flux in the other winding. With ym &frac14; p/2, considered
windings are orthogonal, and therefore, L13 &frac14; 0. With ym &frac14; p, positive current in
one winding gives negative flux in the other; thus, L13 &lt; 0. Variation of coefficient
L13 can be described by function L13(ym) &frac14; Lm cos(ym), where Lm &frac14; k (LSLR)0.5 is
the maximum value of L13, obtained in position ym &frac14; 0. Other coefficients of the
inductance matrix can be determined in a like manner. It should be noted that the
</p>
<p>matrix is not stationary. Some coefficients change with the angle ym &frac14; Omt. There-
fore, there is a nonzero derivative dL/dt. Recall at this point that the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque of electromechanical converter can be obtained as Tem &frac14; &frac12; iT (dL/dym)i.

<p>15.16 Transforming Rotor Variables to Stator Side
</p>
<p>Voltage balance equations for rotor windings are given in Sect. 15.9, and they
</p>
<p>comprise rotor currents iaR and ibR. The rotor currents are not directly accessible.
</p>
<p>They cannot be measured by accessing the rotor cage and inserting measurement
</p>
<p>devices. Moreover, the two-phase model replaces the rotor cage by an equivalent
</p>
<p>two-phase winding brought into the short circuit. Hence, the rotor currents iaR and
</p>
<p>ibR are not the currents flowing through the rotor bars but the currents of the two-
</p>
<p>phase equivalent which has replaced the cage. The short-circuiting effect of the
</p>
<p>cage can be modeled by the two-phase equivalent having large number of
</p>
<p>conductors of small cross-sectional area or small number of conductors of large
</p>
<p>cross-sectional area. Therefore, the number of turns in the two phases depicting the
</p>
<p>rotor can be arbitrarily selected, as explained in the following example.
</p>
<p>4This assumption is not valid for nonlinear magnetic circuits. Magnetic saturation contributes to
</p>
<p>so-called cross saturation in orthogonal windings, phenomenon where the flux in one of the
</p>
<p>windings changes the saturation level in common magnetic circuit and, hence, changes the flux of
</p>
<p>the other winding.
</p>
<p>408 15 Modeling of Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The magnetomotive force created by electrical currents of all the conductors
</p>
<p>placed in one rotor slot is equal to the sum of their currents. The slot may have only
</p>
<p>one conductor with current of 100 A or 100 conductors each carrying 1 A, and in
</p>
<p>both cases, the magnetomotive force will be 100 ampere-turns. This value
</p>
<p>corresponds to circular integral of magnetic field H along closed contour encircling
</p>
<p>the slot. Hence, the system with two-phase windings that models the rotor cage
</p>
<p>could have an arbitrary number of turns, as long as the product Ni of the rotor
</p>
<p>current and the number of turns equals the value created by the original short-
</p>
<p>circuited cage.
</p>
<p>The freedom in choosing the number of turns of the two-phase rotor equivalent is
</p>
<p>most frequently used to introduce NR &frac14; NS. Assuming that the rotor has the same
number of turns as the stator results in LS &frac14; NS 2/Rm &frac14; NR 2/Rm &frac14; LR and gives
Lm &frac14; k (LSLR)0,5 &frac14; kLS &frac14; kLR, while the leakage inductances of the stator and
rotor become LgS &frac14; LS � Lm &frac14; (1 � k)LS &frac14; (1 � k)LR &frac14; LgR. The obtained
expressions are based on the assumption that differences in magnetic resistances
</p>
<p>for the stator and rotor fluxes are negligible. This assumption is valid in most cases.
</p>
<p>The inductance matrix allows that each of the four flux linkages is expressed in
</p>
<p>terms of electrical currents. For example, the flux in phase a of the stator is
</p>
<p>Cas &frac14; Lsias &thorn; Lm cos ym iaR � Lm sin ymibR: (15.42)
</p>
<p>Question (15.7): Stator currents of an induction machine are iaS &frac14; ImS cosoet and
ibS &frac14; ImS sinoet, where oe &gt; 0 and rotor currents are iaR &frac14; ImR sinoxt and ibR &frac14;
ImR cosoxt having the angular frequency 0 &lt; ox &lt; &lt;oe. The machine operates at
steady state. By using (15.42) for flux CaS, determine the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>Answer (15.7): Currents iaS and ibS produce the stator magnetomotive force and
flux rotating in positive direction. Phase sequence of the given rotor currents is such
</p>
<p>that they create magnetic field which rotates relative to the rotor at the speed of
</p>
<p>ox &frac14; Ox in negative direction. In steady state, the rotor and stator fields revolve
synchronously. Therefore, it is concluded that om &frac14; ox &thorn; oe. The same conclu-
sion can be obtained from the expression for flux, CaS &frac14; LSImS cosoet &thorn;
LmImR(cosomt sinoxt � sinomt cosoxt) &frac14; LSImS cosoet � LmImR sin(omt-oxt).
The elements of this must have the same frequency in steady-state conditions
</p>
<p>since the stator and rotor variables rotate at the same speed oe, maintaining the
</p>
<p>relative positions unchanged. This condition is met in cases om � ox &frac14; +oe as
well as om � ox &frac14; �oe, that is, for the speeds of rotation om &frac14; ox &thorn; oe or
om &frac14; �oe &thorn; ox. According to the assumed conditions, 0 &lt; ox � oe, and the
solution is om &frac14; ox &thorn; oe. In this solution, the slip oslip &frac14; oe � om &frac14; �ox is
negative; hence, the rotor is rotating faster than the field. The machine operates in
</p>
<p>generator mode.
</p>
<p>Question (15.8): Starting from the inductance matrix of the system of windings aS,
bS, aR, and bR, prove that the torque is equal to Tem &frac14; (3/2) (CaS ibS � CbS iaS).
</p>
<p>15.16 Transforming Rotor Variables to Stator Side 409</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Answer (15.8): The electromagnetic torque is given by expression Tem &frac14; &frac12; iT[dL
(ym)/dym]i where L(ym) is the inductance matrix whose elements are dependent on
</p>
<p>position ym of the rotor with respect to the stator. Variable elements of the
</p>
<p>inductance matrix are L13 &frac14; L31, L14 &frac14; L41, L23 &frac14; L32, and L24 &frac14; L42, while the
remaining coefficients are constant and result in dLјк/dym &frac14; 0. The calculation can
be simplified because LT &frac14; L; thus, the result can be obtained by doubling the
contributions of coefficients L13, L14, L23, and L24. Finally, one obtains &frac12; i
</p>
<p>T[dL(ym)/
</p>
<p>dym]i &frac14; �Lmsinym iaS iaR � Lmcos(ym)iaS ibR &thorn; Lmcos(ym)iaR ibS � Lmsin(ym)ibR
ibS. The same result is obtained by starting from expression (CaS ibS � CbS iaS) and
introducing the replacement where the fluxes are expressed from the first and
</p>
<p>second row of the inductance matrix. In expression Tem &frac14; (3/2) (CaS ibS � CbS
iaS), coefficient 3/2 is the consequence of adopting the 3F/2F transform with
</p>
<p>KU &frac14; KI &frac14; KC &frac14; 2/3.
</p>
<p>15.17 Mathematical Model
</p>
<p>In subsequent considerations, mathematical model of induction machine is
</p>
<p>presented in terms of coordinates aS, bS, aR, and bR. The voltage balance equations
</p>
<p>and inductance matrix were defined already within previous sections. The model is
</p>
<p>completed by adding Newton equation and the torque expression Tem &frac14; (3/2)(CaS
ibS � CbS iaS). This set of differential equations and algebraic expressions
constitutes mathematical model of induction machine, based on previously adopted
</p>
<p>approximations. The model is summarized in (15.43), (15.44), (15.45), and (15.46).
</p>
<p>It can be used in its present form to predict dynamic behavior and steady-state
</p>
<p>properties of induction machines. For that to be achieved, it is sufficient to enter
</p>
<p>(15.43), (15.44), (15.45), and (15.46) into program for computer simulation of
</p>
<p>dynamic systems. Hence, developed model is the correct representation of behavior
</p>
<p>of induction machines. Yet, it has drawbacks that hinder further analytical
</p>
<p>considerations and introduce difficulties in drawing conclusions and deriving the
</p>
<p>steady-state characteristics.
</p>
<p>There could be specific situations where the given model cannot serve as an
</p>
<p>accurate representation of the inductionmachine. In caseswhere the iron losses cannot
</p>
<p>be neglected, or the magnetic saturation is emphasized, as well as in cases where the
</p>
<p>remaining two approximations do not hold, the model may give erroneous results. In
</p>
<p>such cases, the model has to be modified and upgraded so as to include the effects that
</p>
<p>were neglected in the first place. The four approximations that were adopted in
</p>
<p>modeling electrical machines are listed and explained in introductory chapters.
</p>
<p>The model contains aS and bS components of the stator variables, as well as aR
and bR components of the rotor variables. Equations (15.43), (15.44), and (15.45)
</p>
<p>remain unaltered whatever the choice of the leading coefficient K of 3F/2F trans-
</p>
<p>form. In (15.46), it is assumed that K &frac14; 2/3 is used. This choice is used throughout
the book, and it requires the ab power and torque to be multiplied by 3/2 in order to
</p>
<p>obtain the power and torque of the original.
</p>
<p>410 15 Modeling of Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It is of interest to recall that the choice of K has to do with selecting the number
</p>
<p>of turns Nab of the equivalent two-phase machine. As already shown, the choice
</p>
<p>Nab &frac14; (3/2)0.5 Nabc and K &frac14; (2/3)0.5 results in a two-phase equivalent which has
power, impedance, and inductance invariance. The two-phase equivalent is a
</p>
<p>mathematical fiction, and it does not have to be actually made. Yet, envisaging
</p>
<p>the variables iaS, ibS, iaR, and ibR as electrical currents of actual phase windings
</p>
<p>helps understanding the basic voltage, current, and flux vectors of the machine, and
</p>
<p>it helps using the model.
</p>
<p>Components of the voltage, current, and flux in the model are projections of the
</p>
<p>relevant vectors of the voltage, current, and flux on axes of coordinate systems
</p>
<p>aS&ndash;bS and aR&ndash;bR. Stator vectors are projected on axes aS and bS of stationary
</p>
<p>coordinate system, while rotor vectors are projected on axes aR and bR of coordinate
</p>
<p>system that revolves with the rotor.
</p>
<p>Complete model is summarized by (15.43), (15.44), (15.45), and (15.46). The
</p>
<p>symbol p in (15.46) represents the number of pairs of magnetic poles, discussed in
</p>
<p>Chap. 16. Preceding considerations assumed that p &frac14; 1, namely, that magnetic
field has one north pole and one south pole:

</p>
<p>The above model is an adequate representation of dynamic and steady-state behav-
</p>
<p>ior of induction machines, but it has drawbacks that make further uses more
</p>
<p>difficult. Such uses are the steady-state analysis, deriving equivalent circuits, and
</p>
<p>conceiving and designing control algorithms. The key problems with the model are:
</p>
<p>1. The presence of trigonometric functions in differential equations
</p>
<p>2. The state variables exhibiting sinusoidal change even in steady state

<p>The consequences of the above issues on clarity and usability of the model can
</p>
<p>be seen by considering the voltage balance equation. Further on, discussion will
</p>
<p>close by proposing further steps that should be taken to obtain a more clear and
</p>
<p>more intuitive model.
</p>
<p>By expressing the flux in terms of electrical currents and introducing the
</p>

<p>Presence of trigonometric functions in differential equations makes the
steady-state analysis more difficult. An attempt to derive a steady-state equivalent

<p>which simplifies greatly the steady-state relations and makes it more obvious.

<p>Applying Laplace transform to the previous equations, an algebraic expression is

</p>
<p>At steady state, electrical current ias exhibits sinusoidal change. Assuming that,
</p>
<p>for the sake of an example, all the electrical currents have the angular frequency o,
</p>
<p>the steady-state analysis implies that the operator s becomes jo, resulting in the

<p>following expression:

</p>
<p>source UaS, resistance RS, an inductance (LS � Lm) carrying current IaS, and an induc-
tance Lm carrying current (IaR &thorn; IaS). Considered example demonstrates that a set of
differential equations with constant coefficients provides the grounds for deriving an
</p>
<p>equivalent circuit that represent the machine in the steady state. The presence of
</p>
<p>trigonometric functions in voltage balance equations makes this impossible.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Sinusoidal change of state variables even in steady-state conditions brings in
more difficulties in steady-state analysis. At the same time, similar difficulties are
</p>
<p>encountered in designing control structures for the current, flux, and torque regula-
</p>
<p>tion. The models with state variables that remain unaltered in the steady state are
</p>
<p>simple to grasp. In their steady-state equations, all the time derivatives of the state
</p>
<p>variables disappear, and the remaining expressions are easy to understand and use.
</p>
<p>Yet, the present model does not have this possibility. The state variables of the
</p>
<p>model, such as ias, exhibit sinusoidal changes even in the steady state.
</p>
<p>Most mathematical models are usually formulated in such way that their state
</p>
<p>variables remain constant in the steady state. The time derivatives of these state
</p>
<p>variables are then equal to zero. In such cases, steady-state relations are obtained
</p>
<p>from differential equations by removing the time derivatives.
</p>
<p>Perpetual changes of state variables even in steady state make the control
</p>
<p>problems more difficult to solve. An example to that is the applications of electrical
</p>
<p>motors in industrial robots or autonomous vehicles, where the electrical motors are
</p>
<p>used for controlling the motion. For that to be achieved, it is necessary to regulate
</p>
<p>some relevant motor variables, such as the flux, torque, speed, and current. The term
</p>
<p>regulation implies:
</p>
<p>&bull; Definition of a desired reference value for the controlled variable (such as the
</p>
<p>phase current) that should be reached and maintained
</p>
<p>&bull; Measurement of the controlled variable (current) and calculation of the error,
</p>
<p>the deviation of the controlled variable from the desired value
</p>
<p>&bull; Performing control algorithm, calculation procedure or formula which receives
</p>

</p>
<p>When the reference value does not change, the steady-state error can be reduced

<p>control action is proportional to the integral of the error. Yet, this maintains the

<p>error at zero only for constant references. In cases when the reference value has

<p>5By using devices called actuators or amplifiers, control output can affect the system and change the

</p>
<p>control algorithm is usually implemented by programming digital signal controllers. Control

<p>variables are obtained in numerical form, as binary-coded digital words that reside within
</p>
<p>processor registers. On the other side, the actual control variable that has the potential to change
</p>
<p>the phase current is the voltage across the phase winding which may change within the range of
</p>
<p>�600 V. The executive organ is often a switching transistor which receives gating signals from the
digital signal controller.

<p>Namely, controlled variable would track the reference with a tracking error that
</p>
<p>depends on the rate of change of the reference. The presence of error can jeopardize
</p>
<p>the operation of the whole system.
</p>
<p>Induction machines have alternating currents in their phase windings. Hence,
</p>
<p>even in the steady state, the variables ias and ibs exhibit sinusoidal changes.
</p>
<p>Whenever there is a need to regulate stator currents of induction machine, con-
</p>
<p>trolled variables are variable even at steady state. This creates the need to transform
</p>
<p>the mathematical model in such way that the steady-state values of the state
</p>
<p>variables are constant and to use this model to formulate the control algorithm.
</p>
<p>Question (15.9): Is there an operating mode of an induction machine where the
frequency of stator currents is zero?
</p>
<p>Answer (15.9): Considering induction machines supplied from constant frequency
voltage sources, the frequency of the stator electrical currents is determined by the
</p>
<p>frequency of voltages fed to the stator winding. If induction machine is connected to
</p>
<p>the mains, the frequency of the stator current will be 50 Hz, irrespective of the rotor
</p>
<p>speed, torque, or power. For that reason, the stator currents may have different
</p>
<p>frequency only in cases when the induction machine is supplied from a variable
</p>
<p>frequency, variable voltage source such as the static power converter which uses
</p>
<p>semiconductor power switches and operates on pulse-width modulation principles.
</p>
<p>In this way, the stator winding can be supplied with a symmetrical system of three-
</p>
<p>phase voltages of variable amplitude and variable frequency.
</p>
<p>In further considerations, it is assumed that the supply voltage has variable
</p>
<p>frequency oe which can be adjusted to achieve desired operating mode. For two-
</p>
<p>pole machine, oe &frac14; Om &thorn; oslip, where Om is the rotor speed while oslip is the slip
frequency. Operating mode where DC current flows through the stator is the one
</p>
<p>where Om &frac14; �oslip, resulting in oe &frac14; 0. It should be noted that the slip frequency
is proportional to the developed electromagnetic torque. Therefore, the operating
</p>
<p>mode with oe &frac14; 0 is reached when the torque and speed of rotation are of different
signs. The rotor rotates at the speed which has the same magnitude as the slip
</p>
<p>frequency, but it has opposite sign. In one of such cases, the motor is stopped and
</p>
<p>develops the torque Tem &frac14; 0. In another example, the rotor revolves at�300 rpm, it
develops positive torque, and it has the rotor currents of 5 Hz.
</p>
<p>15.19 Model in Synchronous Coordinate Frame
</p>
<p>The problems of analysis and control based onmathematical model in a&ndash;b coordinate
</p>
<p>frame arise due to the fact that the state variables exhibit sinusoidal change even in
</p>
<p>the steady state. Namely, projections of the vectors of currents, voltages, and flux
</p>
<p>linkages on the axes of a&ndash;b coordinate frame change as sinusoidal functions even in
</p>
<p>steady state, with constant amplitude of magnetomotive force FS, constant flux, and
</p>
<p>constant rotor speed. This deficiency of the model can be removed by applying
</p>
<p>another transform of the state coordinates and replacing the existing state variables
</p>
<p>414 15 Modeling of Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>by the new ones. The new variables should be selected so that their values at steady
</p>
<p>state do not vary. The new coordinate transform should maintain the invariability in
</p>
<p>terms of impedance, inductance, and power. For that to be achieved, the same
</p>
<p>transformation matrix should be applied to all the variables, whether the currents,
</p>
<p>voltages, or flux linkages. The question arises about how to devise this new coordi-
</p>
<p>nate transform.
</p>
<p>15.20 Park Transform
</p>
<p>In the model of the machine which is formulated in stationary a&ndash;b frame, the stator
</p>
<p>currents iaS and ibS are projections of the vector of magnetomotive force FS &frac14; NS iS
on axes of the aS&ndash;bS coordinate system. The problem arises due to the fact that FS is
</p>
<p>a rotating vector. Its rotation with respect to a&ndash;b frame makes the projections iaS
and ibS variable. In steady state, they become sinusoidal function. In order to solve
</p>
<p>the problem, it is necessary to envisage a new coordinate system which is rotating at
</p>
<p>the same speed as the magnetomotive force FS. In this case, projections of this
</p>
<p>vector on new pair of axes do not change in the steady state, as the relative position
</p>
<p>between the revolving vector and the new frame does not change. The same
</p>
<p>conclusion applies for the voltage and flux vectors. Therefore, the new transform
</p>
<p>of the state coordinates should formulate the model of induction machine in a new
</p>
<p>coordinate system which revolves synchronously with the field.
</p>
<p>By adopting a synchronously rotating coordinate system having axes d and q,
</p>
<p>projections id and iq of the stator current vector iS &frac14; FS/NS on these new axes have
constant steady-state values. Therefore, by transforming all the stator quantities
</p>
<p>from the stationary aS&ndash;bS coordinate system to the synchronously rotating d&ndash;q
</p>
<p>coordinate system, a model of the stator winding is obtained where the relevant
</p>
<p>quantities have constant steady-state values.
</p>
<p>Transform implies a relation that expresses the variables of the d&ndash;q system
</p>
<p>(id and iq) in terms of the variables of the aS&ndash;bS coordinate system (iaS and ibS).
</p>
<p>Applying a coordinate transform does not introduce any change to the considered
</p>
<p>induction machine nor to its flux or torque. The transform merely represents a
</p>
<p>different point of view and represents one and the same actual systems by means of
</p>
<p>another mathematical representation. Therefore, no matter whether the mathemati-
</p>
<p>cal model is formulated in the stationary or in the synchronous coordinate frame, it
</p>
<p>must describe the same vectors of the magnetomotive force, flux, voltage, and
</p>
<p>current as well as the same torque, speed, and power of electromechanical conver-
</p>
<p>sion. Consequently, both the model in a&ndash;b frame and the model in d&ndash;q frame must
</p>
<p>have one and the same vector of the stator magnetomotive force FS. In other words,
</p>
<p>the vector FS created by currents iaS and ibS must have the same amplitude and
</p>
<p>spatial orientation as the vector FS created by id and iq, the stator currents
</p>
<p>transformed into d&ndash;q coordinate frame.
</p>
<p>Coordinate transform is essentially a mathematical operation, and it does not
</p>
<p>have to result in state variables that correspond to an actual, physical machine.
</p>
<p>15.20 Park Transform 415</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In many cases, it is not even possible to construct an induction machine that would
</p>
<p>have the voltages and currents that correspond to the ones obtained from coordinate
</p>
<p>transform. Yet, an attempt to represent the variables id and iq as electrical currents
</p>
<p>of a new, virtual stator winding may help understanding and using the new model.
</p>
<p>The new transform can be represented by removing the stator phase windings aS and
</p>
<p>bS and installing new stator phases d and q, with their magnetic axes lying along the
</p>
<p>d and q of the new coordinate frame, as shown in Fig. 15.8. These d&ndash;q windings
</p>
<p>cannot be actually made, so it is correct to call them virtual. Electrical currents id
and iq of these new virtual windings must result in the same vector FS as the
</p>
<p>previous, created by electrical currents in phases aS and bS.
</p>
<p>In the following figures and illustrations that involve the new d&ndash;q coordinate
</p>
<p>frame, new notation is introduced for the phase windings and electrical currents in
</p>
<p>d&ndash;q frame. The virtual stator windings are denoted by d and q, while the virtual
</p>
<p>rotor windings are denoted by D and Q. The stator currents in new coordinate frame
</p>
<p>are denoted by id and iq, while the rotor currents are iD and iQ. Components of
</p>
<p>electrical currents in d&ndash;q frame are equal to projections of current vectors on axes d
</p>
<p>and q. Should virtual windings d and q actually exist, the currents id and iq would
</p>
<p>result into the same vector of the stator magnetomotive force FS which actually
</p>
<p>exists in the original machine. Neither the stator nor the rotor could have their actual
</p>
<p>phase windings residing in the d&ndash;q frame. The only purpose of showing them in
</p>
<p>illustrations is to help visualizing the state variables which are obtained by rota-
</p>
<p>tional transform, such as id and iq, and also to facilitate the model analysis and use.

<p>15.21 Transform Matrix
</p>
<p>Relations of the rotational transform can be derived from the condition of invari-
</p>
<p>ability of the vector FS. In the preceding figure, the angle ye denotes the angular
</p>
<p>shift of the revolving axis d with respect to the still axis aS. Projection of the current
</p>
<p>component iaS on axis d is iaS cosye, while projection of current component ibS on
</p>
<p>the same axis is ibS sinye. Hence, projection of the vector FS/NS on axis d is equal to
</p>
<p>iaS cosye &thorn; ibS sinye. Considering d&ndash;q frame variables, the current iq produces the
component of FS in direction of the axis q, and it cannot contribute to d component
</p>
<p>of FS. Hence, the current id has to be equal to iaS cosye &thorn; ibS sinye in order to
achieve invariability of vector FS (Fig. 15.9). By summing projections of currents
</p>
<p>iaS and ibS on axis q, one obtains that current iq in virtual phase winding q must be
</p>
<p>equal to � iaSsinye &thorn; ibScosye. Park rotational transform is summarized by using
the matrix given by (15.47). Determinant of the transform matrix is equal to 1. By
</p>
<p>transforming any vector from stationary frame to synchronously rotating frame, one
</p>
<p>obtains the vector of the same amplitude as the original. By applying the same
</p>
<p>transform matrix to voltages, currents, and fluxes, one obtains the relevant variables
</p>
<p>in d&ndash;q coordinate system (ud, uq, id, iq,Cd,Cq). Proposed transform is invariable in
</p>
<p>terms of impedance, inductance, and power (det T &frac14; 1). Variables Cd and Cq
denote total flux linkages of the virtual stator windings in d and q axes.

<p>Question (15.10): Starting from expression uaS &frac14; RSiaS &thorn; dCaS/dt, is it possible

<p>and other variables of the d&ndash;q frame. The presence of unchanged stator resistanceRS is
</p>
<p>expected since the transform is invariant in terms of impedance. However, it cannot be
</p>
<p>stated that ud &frac14; RSid &thorn; dCd/dt. Namely, the voltage balance equation u &frac14; Ri &thorn; dC/
dt applies to any winding that actually exists or the winding that could actually be
</p>
<p>made. Relation u &frac14; Ri &thorn; dC/dt was used to model the voltage balance in aS&ndash;bS
coordinate frame. Although the original induction machine has three phases, the two-
</p>
<p>phase stator winding in aS&ndash;bS frame can be actually made. Therefore, the stator phase
</p>
<p>windings aS and bS can be considered as real windings. Thus, the voltage balance
</p>
<p>equation in aS&ndash;bS frame is u &frac14; Ri &thorn; dC/dt. On the other hand, the phase windings in
dq frame cannot bemade. The analysis performed later on proves that the voltage ud is
</p>
<p>not equal to RSid &thorn; dCd/dt. The actual voltage balance equations in dq frame,
describing the virtual voltages, will be derived by applying the transform matrix to
</p>
<p>equations uaS &frac14; RSiaS &thorn; dCaS/dt and ubS &frac14; RSibS &thorn; dCbS/dt.
</p>
<p>15.22 Transforming Rotor Variables
</p>
<p>It is beneficial to have both the stator and the rotor variables residing in the same
</p>
<p>frame of coordinates. For that to be achieved, it is necessary to apply rotational
</p>
<p>transform to the rotor variables and find their DQ equivalents.
</p>
<p>Park transform of the stator phase windings aS and bS results in two virtual stator
</p>
<p>phases in dq frame. In the same way, it is necessary to replace the short-circuited
</p>
<p>rotor cage by two virtual rotor phases residing in d&ndash;q coordinate system. For clarity,
</p>
<p>notation adopted hereafter implies that the stator variables have lower case
</p>
<p>subscripts dq, while the rotor variables have upper case subscripts DQ.
</p>
<p>It is necessary to explain the need for transforming the stator and rotor variables to
</p>
<p>the same, synchronously rotating, coordinate system. First of all, it should be recalled
</p>
<p>that the voltage balance equations in stationary a&ndash;b coordinate frame are difficult to
</p>
<p>cope with due to variable coefficients of differential equations. These variable
</p>
<p>coefficients come from variable elements in the inductance matrix, such as L13 &frac14;
Lmcos(ym). Some mutual inductances between stator and rotor phases are variable
</p>
<p>(15.48) due to change in relative position of the twowindings. In (15.45), this comes as
</p>
<p>a consequence of the aR&ndash;bR framemovingwith respect to the aS&ndash;bS frame. Themutual
</p>
<p>inductance between the two windings does not change as long as they maintain the
</p>
<p>same relative position. Hence, any pair of windings residing in the same coordinate
</p>
<p>frame, whether revolving or stationary, does not change relative position, and there-
</p>
<p>fore, they have constant mutual inductance. Transformation of rotor windings from
</p>
<p>aRbR frame to d&ndash;q coordinate frame can be depicted as removing the original aRbR
windings and replacing them with a pair of virtual rotor phases denoted by DQ,
</p>
<p>residing in the same d&ndash;q coordinate frame as the virtual stator phases denoted by dq.
</p>
<p>Now the stator dq windings do not move with respect to the rotor DQ windings.
</p>
<p>Therefore, all the self-inductances and all the mutual inductances are constant. The
</p>
<p>inductance matrix that corresponds to virtual windings in dq frame has constant
</p>
<p>418 15 Modeling of Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>elements. It will be shown later that, as a consequence, the voltage balance equations
</p>
<p>in dq frame do not have variable coefficients.
</p>
<p>In addition to obtaining a constant inductance matrix, transformation of the rotor
</p>
<p>variables to d&ndash;q system is also required in order to obtain a mathematical model
</p>
<p>where the rotor variables have constant steady-state values. The actual rotor cage
</p>
<p>has AC currents of angular frequency oslip &frac14; oe � om &frac14; oe � pOm. These
currents create magnetomotive force and flux of the rotor which revolve at
</p>
<p>the speed Oslip with respect to the rotor. With p &frac14; 1, their speed with respect to the
stator is Oslip &thorn; Om &frac14; oslip &thorn; om &frac14; oe. In other words, the rotor magnetomotive
force and flux vectors revolve at the same speed (in synchronism) with the stator
</p>
<p>vectors. Some phase and/or spatial shift among these variables may exist at steady
</p>
<p>state. Therefore, projections of the rotor variables on d&ndash;q do not vary at steady state.
</p>
<p>Hence, the actual rotor variables should be transformed to d&ndash;q coordinate frame.
</p>
<p>Rotational transform of the rotor variables is illustrated in Fig. 15.10. It should
</p>
<p>be noted that the product of the rotor currents and the number of rotor turns NR iaR
and NR ibR are equal to projections of the rotor magnetomotive force vector FR on
</p>
<p>axes aR&ndash;bR of the rotor coordinate system. The angular displacement between axes
</p>
<p>aR and aS is determined by the rotor position ym. Synchronously rotating d&ndash;q
</p>
<p>coordinate system leads by yslip with respect to the rotor; thus, its advance with
</p>
<p>respect to the stator is ye &frac14; yslip &thorn; ym.
Transformation matrix for the rotor variables is derived starting from invariabil-
</p>
<p>ity of the rotor magnetomotive force. Projection of the rotor phase current iaR on
</p>
<p>axis d is equal to iaR cosyslip, while projection of the rotor phase current ibR on the
</p>
<p>same axis is equal to ibR sinyslip. Therefore, the current of the virtual rotor winding
</p>
<p>D is equal to iD &frac14; iaR cosyslip &thorn; ibR sinyslip. Similarly, iQ &frac14; �iaR sinyslip &thorn; ibR
cosyslip. These relations can be written in matrix form, as shown in the (15.48). The
</p>
<p>same transformation matrix is applied to all rotor variables, resulting in voltages of
</p>
<p>virtual rotor windings uD &frac14; uQ &frac14; 0 and providing total flux linkages CD and CQ:

<p>15.23 Vectors and Complex Numbers
</p>
<p>Park transform relates coordinates of vectors in a&ndash;b coordinate system to
</p>
<p>coordinates of the same vectors in d&ndash;q coordinate system. All the voltages, currents,
</p>
<p>magnetomotive forces, and fluxes can be represented by vectors, either in ab frame
</p>
<p>or in dq frame. All the vectors have two components, being associated with two-
</p>
<p>phase windings. Projection of each voltage, current, or flux vector on one of the
</p>
<p>axes corresponds to voltage, current, or flux linkage in the phase winding residing
</p>
<p>on corresponding axis.
</p>
<p>With all the vectors residing in plane, it is possible to use complex notation in
</p>
<p>representing individual vectors. Namely, a vector can be represented by a complex
</p>
<p>number, with real and imaginary parts representing the projections of the vector on
</p>
<p>the two orthogonal axes. In this way, Park transform notation can be simplified, and
</p>
<p>the transformation matrix reduced to a complex number. As an example, the vector
</p>
<p>of the stator current can be expressed in terms of its aS component, directed along aS
axis, and its bS component, directed along bS axis. If aS axis is given attributes of the
</p>
<p>real axis and axis bS attributes of the imaginary axis, the aS&ndash;bS plane is interpreted
</p>
<p>as the complex plane, where the current vector is represented by complex number,
</p>
<p>~iabS &frac14;~a0iaS &thorn;~b0ibS ) iabS &frac14; iaS &thorn; j ibS:
</p>
<p>Similarly, considering the current vector in d&ndash;q system, axis d can be given
</p>
<p>attributes of the real axis, while axis q can be treated as imaginary axis, converting
</p>
<p>in this way d&ndash;q space into a complex plane, where the current is represented by the
</p>
<p>complex number idq &frac14; id &thorn; jiq. Complex notation of current vectors is not unique.
With axis d as real axis, the number idq is obtained, different than the complex
</p>
<p>number iab obtained with axis aS as real axis.

<p>Complex number idq &frac14; id &thorn; jiq is a compact way of representing the stator
current vector by representing the two state variables, id and iq, as a single complex
</p>
<p>number. The choice of real axis (d) and complex axis (q) is in accordance with the
</p>
<p>fact that axis q leads by p/2 and that imaginary unit j &frac14; exp(jp/2) represents the
phase shift of p/2. Complex notation idq acquires another significance in steady
</p>
<p>state. With id and iq remaining constant, the steady-state value of idq becomes a
</p>
<p>complex constant, phasor. The amplitude and argument of this phasor determine
</p>
<p>the amplitude and the initial phase of the stator current.

<p>15.24 Inductance Matrix in dq Frame
</p>
<p>By application of Park transform, the rotor and stator windings are transferred to
</p>
<p>synchronously rotating d&ndash;q system. The virtual stator windings are denoted by
</p>
<p>subscripts d and q, while virtual rotor windings are denoted by subscripts D and Q.
</p>
<p>Rotation of dq frame does not change relative position of stator and rotor virtual
</p>
<p>phases; thus, all coefficients of relevant inductance matrix remain constant. The
</p>
<p>flux of the stator winding d is determined by the first row of matrix, Cd &frac14; LSid &thorn;
LmiD. The mutual inductance is constant since windings d andD do not change their
</p>
<p>relative positions.
</p>
<p>Revolving frame has an angular speed Oe which is the same as the speed of the
</p>
<p>revolving field. The speed Oe is determined by the angular frequency of stator

<p>The stator and rotor windings are represented by virtual dq and DQ windings
</p>
<p>residing in dq frame. Their magnetic axes coincide, and they do not move relative to
</p>
<p>one another. Therefore, their mutual inductances do not change. The mutual

<p>Question (15.11): The electromagnetic torque acting on moving part of the system
which comprises several magnetically coupled contours is determined from the
</p>
<p>expression Tem &frac14; &frac12; iT(dL/dym)i, where L is the inductance matrix. Taking into
account the matrix given in (15.53), it is concluded that dL/dym &frac14; 0 which,
introduced into the torque expression, gives Tem &frac14; 0. Is this consideration correct?
Answer (15.11): Expression Tem &frac14; &frac12; iT(dL/dym)i has been derived starting from the
expression for the field energy and using the voltage equilibrium equations for actual
</p>
<p>physical windings. There is no proof that the same expression applies for the induc-
</p>
<p>tance matrix and electrical currents of virtual, inexistent windings. The torque expres-
</p>
<p>sion &frac12; iT(dL/dym)i can be used only with the inductance matrix L and electrical
</p>
<p>currents that correspond to actual physical windings. Hence, substitution of (15.53)
</p>
<p>into the torque expression is erroneous. Notice that the torque expression can be used
</p>
<p>in conjunction with ab variables. This is due to the fact that one can actually build a
</p>
<p>two-phase machine with ab windings which represents the original three-phase
</p>
<p>machine. Virtual windings such as d, q, D, and Q cannot exist in an actual machine.
</p>
<p>Yet, they are introduced as a means to understand and use Park rotational transform.
</p>
<p>Question (15.12): The self-inductance LS of the stator phase windings of a three-
phase machine and coefficient of magnetic coupling between the stator and rotor k
</p>
<p>are known. Determine the coefficients of inductance matrix for the winding system
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Answer (15.12): The inductance matrix in (15.53) is obtained by applying Clarke
3F/2F transform to the original three-phase machine and then applying Park
</p>
<p>rotational transform to the two-phase ab equivalent. The applied transforms are
</p>
<p>invariant in terms of inductance. Therefore, elements L11 and L22 of the matrix are
</p>
<p>equal to LS. Considering the rotor model, it is usually assumed that the short-
</p>
<p>circuited rotor winding has the same number of turns as the stator and that magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance along paths of the two fluxes is approximately equal; thus, LS &frac14; LR. The
coefficients of mutual inductance are equal to Lm &frac14; k(LSLR)0.5 &frac14; kLS.
</p>
<p>Successive application of Clarke and Park transforms results in the transform
</p>
<p>known as Blondel transform.

<p>15.25 Voltage Balance Equations in dq Frame
</p>
<p>Mathematical model of the electrical subsystem comprises the voltage balance
</p>
<p>equations, differential equations that express the equilibrium of the supply voltage,
</p>
<p>the voltage drops, and electromotive forces in actual phase windings. These
</p>
<p>equations can be transformed from ab frame to dq frame, synchronous with the
</p>
<p>revolving field. In ab stationary coordinate system, voltage equilibrium in the stator
</p>
<p>phase windings is given by
</p>
<p>uaS &frac14; RSiaS &thorn; dCaS=dt; ubS &frac14; RSibS &thorn; dCbS=dt: (15.54)
</p>
<p>Multiplication of the second equation by j and summing the two equations result
</p>
<p>in a single voltage balance equation with voltages, fluxes, and currents expressed as

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Therefore, voltage balance equations of virtual stator phases in dq frame do not
</p>
<p>have the form u &frac14; Ri &thorn; dC/dt. They contain an additional member which comes
as a consequence of Park transform. The above equation with complex numbers can
</p>
<p>be separated into real and imaginary parts, resulting in two scalar equations. The
</p>
<p>same procedure can be applied to the voltage balance equations of the rotor
</p>
<p>windings, but this time the angle ye is replaced by angle yslip. This is due to the
</p>
<p>fact that the angle between the original rotor coordinate system (aR&ndash;bR) and the
</p>
<p>target dq coordinate system is yslip &frac14; ye � ym. For the virtual rotor windings (DQ),

<p>15.26 Electrical Subsystem
</p>
<p>This section summarizes the model of the electrical subsystem of induction
</p>
<p>machine expressed in synchronous dq frame, where the state variables are con-
</p>
<p>stant in the steady state and where the inductance matrix of virtual windings has
</p>
<p>constant elements. This model is based on the four approximations adopted in
</p>
<p>modeling induction machines. They are detailed in introductory chapters, and
</p>
<p>they include:
</p>
<p>1. Neglected effects of distributed parameters.
</p>
<p>2. The energy of electrical field is neglected along with parasitic capacitances.
</p>
<p>3. Neglected are the iron losses.
</p>
<p>4. Magnetic saturation is neglected along with nonlinear B(H) characteristic of
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic materials.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the leading coefficient of Clarke transform, used to replace the three-
</p>
<p>phase original with the two-phase equivalent, is K &frac14; 2/3. For simplicity, further
considerations assume that the induction machine under consideration is two-pole
</p>
<p>machine where p &frac14; 1 and that electrical angular frequency o corresponds to
mechanical angular speed O, resulting in o &frac14; pO.
</p>
<p>The following equations give complete mathematical model of the electrical
</p>
<p>subsystem of an induction machine in the synchronously rotating dq coordinate
</p>
<p>system. The two voltage balance equations with complex variables are split into
</p>

</p>
<p>Answer (15.13): By using complex notation in vector representation, where CabS

<p>Chapter 16
</p>
<p>Induction Machines at Steady State
</p>
<p>In this chapter, steady state operation of induction machines is studied with the aim
</p>
<p>to derive the equivalent circuit and mechanical characteristic of induction machine.
</p>
<p>The steady state model is derived from the dynamic model, developed and
</p>
<p>explained in the previous chapter. The voltage balance equations at steady state
</p>
<p>are used to develop the steady state equivalent circuit of the machine with squirrel
</p>
<p>cage rotor. At the same time, the concept of the equivalent transformer is introduced
</p>
<p>to derive the same steady state equivalent circuit. The equivalent circuit is used to
</p>
<p>determine the steady state currents, torque, power, losses, and flux linkages. Typical
</p>
<p>resistances and inductances of the equivalent circuit are explained and discussed,
</p>
<p>along with typical experimental procedures for their measurement and estimation.
</p>
<p>The system of relative units is introduced and explained, along with benefits that
</p>
<p>come from its use. Characteristic examples are studied to develop skills in working
</p>
<p>with relative units and selecting the base quantities used in scaling the absolute
</p>
<p>values into relative values. The functions that approximate the mechanical charac-
</p>
<p>teristic of induction machine and typical mechanical loads are introduced and
</p>
<p>explained. Natural mechanical characteristic is analyzed along with the start-up
</p>
<p>mode, rated operation, and no load operation. Breakdown torque is studied and
</p>
<p>explained in both motor and generator modes. Stable and unstable equilibrium
</p>
<p>points on mechanical characteristic are discussed and explained. The influence of
</p>
<p>machine resistances and reactances on the start-up torque, breakdown torque,
</p>
<p>breakdown slip, and coefficient of efficiency is analyzed and explained. This
</p>
<p>chapter proceeds by summarizing energy losses in windings, magnetic circuits,
</p>
<p>and mechanical losses due to rotation. Calculation of steady state losses is
</p>
<p>explained on the basis of the steady state equivalent circuit. The losses are
</p>
<p>presented in the form of power balance chart drawn for induction machine that
</p>
<p>operates in motoring mode. Simplified power balance is derived by splitting the air-
</p>
<p>gap power into rotor losses and mechanical power, according to the relative slip s.
</p>
<p>This chapter ends with deriving power balance chart for induction generator and
</p>
<p>discussing generator operating mode of induction machines.

</p>
<p>If the rotor of an induction machine rotates at the speed of Om 6&frac14; Oe, different than
the synchronous speedOe, which determines the angular speed of the magnetic field,
</p>
<p>then the slip speed is Oslip &frac14; Oe � Om. The rotor speed changes during transients
and represents one of the state variables. At steady state, the rotor revolves at a
</p>
<p>constant speed. The slip speed Oslip determines the angular frequency of the rotor
</p>
<p>currents,oslip &frac14; pOslip. The ratio s &frac14; oslip/oe &frac14; Oslip/Oe is called relative slip. For
a two-pole motor fed from the mains with the line frequency of 50 Hz, the synchro-
</p>
<p>nous speed is 50 rev/s or 3,000 rpm (revolutions per minute). If the rotor revolves at
</p>
<p>2,700 rpm, the relative slip is s &frac14; 300/3,000 &frac14; 0.1. For inductionmotor with locked
rotor (the rotor which does not rotate), relative slip is s &frac14; 1.
</p>
<p>16.4 Losses and Mechanical Power
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic torque Tem acts on the rotor which revolves at the speed Om.
</p>
<p>Related mechanical power pmR &frac14; TemOm is also called internal mechanical
power. It is slightly different than the mechanical power pm &frac14; TmOm transferred
to the external mechanical load via shaft. The difference between pmR &frac14; TemOm
and pm &frac14; TmOm appears due to internal mechanical losses within induction
machines. These losses are the air friction, friction in the bearings, and other losses
</p>
<p>in mechanical subsystem of the machine. Therefore, electromagnetic torque Tem is
</p>
<p>different than the torque Tm which is passed to the work machine through the shaft.
</p>
<p>Detailed analysis of losses in induction machine is given in Sect. 16.24, along with
</p>
<p>the balance of power which is shown in Fig. 16.17.
</p>
<p>Mechanical power pmR differs from the air-gap power pd by the amount of losses
</p>
<p>in rotor winding and rotor magnetic circuit. Electrical currents in rotor bars create
</p>
<p>losses proportional to the square of the current, Ri2. Although the rotor bars are
</p>
<p>usually made of aluminum, losses in the cage are frequently called copper losses
</p>
<p>and denoted as PCu2. In addition to losses in the rotor windings, there are losses in
</p>
<p>the rotor magnetic circuit, denoted by PFeR. Rotor magnetic circuit is, like that of
</p>
<p>the stator, made of iron sheets. It contains magnetic field with sinusoidal change at
</p>
<p>angular frequencyoslip, creating losses due to hysteresis and eddy currents. The slip
</p>
<p>frequency oslip is much lower than the stator frequency oe; thus, it is justified to
</p>
<p>neglect iron losses in the rotor. This approximation is not justified for operating
</p>
<p>modes where the assumption oslip � oe does not hold, namely, where the relative
slip does not satisfy relation s � 1.
</p>
<p>One example where the rotor iron losses cannot be neglected is the case of where
</p>
<p>the induction motor with its rotor at standstill gets connected to the mains. This is
</p>
<p>the most common way of starting mains supplied induction motors. With locked

<p>rotor, Om &frac14; 0 and s &frac14; 1. The frequency of electrical currents in the rotor cage
corresponds to the line frequency as well as the frequency of changes of magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B within the rotor magnetic circuit.

<p>In steady state operation, the slip frequency is much lower than the line frequency.
</p>
<p>Therefore, iron losses in the rotor magnetic circuit are rather low. Total losses
</p>
<p>within the rotor are obtained by adding the rotor cage Joule losses to the iron loses
</p>
<p>in the rotor magnetic circuit. At steady state, mechanical power PmR is equal to
</p>

<p>Question (16.1): A two-pole induction motor is fed from the mains and operates at
steady state. It is known that the iron losses in stator magnetic circuit cannot be
</p>
<p>neglected. The losses in copper of the stator windings Pcu1, apparent power S which
</p>
<p>the motor takes from the mains, and phase delay &rsquo; of the current with respect to the
voltage are known. Determine the air gap and electromagnetic torque.
</p>
<p>Answer (16.1): In steady state, the average value of the rate of change dWm/dt of
the field energy is equal to zero. The air-gap power is Pd &frac14; S cos(&rsquo;) � PFe � Pcu1.
The electromagnetic torque is equal to Tem &frac14; pPd/oe &frac14; Pd/Oe, where oe is the
angular frequency of the mains.
</p>
<p>Question (16.2): A mains-fed induction machine rotates at the speed of 2,700 rpm.
Estimate the coefficient of efficiency of the machine.
</p>
<p>Answer (16.2): Relative slip is s &frac14; (3,000&ndash;2,700)/3,000 &frac14; 0.1. Neglecting losses
in the stator, one obtains that the useful power is close to 90% of input power, while
</p>
<p>the rotor losses account for 10% of the input power.

<p>variables such as the voltages, currents, or fluxes are projections of respective
</p>
<p>vectors on the axes of selected ab or dq coordinate system. With Park transform,
</p>
<p>dq coordinate system revolves in synchronism with the field. Therefore, all the
</p>
<p>variables in dq frame are constant in the steady state, and their first derivatives are
</p>
<p>equal to zero. The model in dq frame facilitates derivation of the equivalent circuit
</p>
<p>that represents the induction machine in steady state. The voltage balance equations
</p>
<p>are given in (15.57) and (15.58) in the form that uses complex representation
</p>
<p>of relevant vectors. Replacing the first time derivatives with zeros, the voltage
</p>
<p>balance equations are reduced to the formU &frac14; RI &thorn; joC. At steady state, complex
representations udq, idq, iDQ, Cdq, and CDQ of relevant vectors become
</p>
<p>complex constants; thus, they can be written as Us, Is, IR, Cs, and CR. These
</p>
<p>constants can be treated as phasors, as both quantity represent the amplitude and
</p>
<p>phase of variables that have sinusoidal change at steady state. They differ from
</p>
<p>common phasors1 by representing the vectors associated to three-phase winding
</p>
<p>system. At the same time, common phasors have the amplitude which corresponds
</p>
<p>to rms value of relevant sinusoidal variable, while the absolute value of complex
</p>
<p>numbers Us, Is, IR, Cs, and CR corresponds to maximum value of relevant sinusoi-
</p>
<p>dal variable. Namely, the absolute value of the phasor Is corresponds to maximum
</p>
<p>value of electrical currents ias(t) and ibs(t). On the other hand, these relations change
</p>
<p>if the leading coefficient K of Clarke transform is not 2/3. In general, the ratio
</p>
<p>between the rms value of the stator voltage and the absolute value Us &frac14; (Ud2
&thorn; Uq2)0.5 of complex constant Us is determined by coefficient K used in 3F/
2F transform. Considerations throughout this book assume that K &frac14; 2/3, which
results in the module of US equal to the peak value of phase voltages:

</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the analysis of steady state operation of induction machines,
</p>
<p>it is desirable to represent the voltage balance equations by the steady state equiva-
</p>
<p>lent circuit. There is, however, a problem in doing that. The stator equations
</p>
<p>comprise the angular frequency oe while the rotor equations have the frequency
</p>
<p>oslip. If both equations are to be represented by a unique circuit which makes the use
</p>
<p>of phasors to represent the voltage balance equations in the steady state, such circuit
</p>
<p>1Common use of phasor has to do with representing the variables with sinusoidal change by
</p>
<p>complex numbers, where the phasor amplitude represents the rms value of corresponding AC
</p>
<p>variable, while the phasor argument represents the initial phase. An example is the complex
</p>
<p>number V &frac14; V ∙ cos(&rsquo;) &thorn; j ∙ V ∙ sin(&rsquo;) which represents the AC variable v(t) &frac14; V ∙ sqrt(2) ∙ cos
(ot &thorn; &rsquo;).

equivalent of the rotor cage, whether aR-bR or D&ndash;Q, may have an arbitrary number

<p>of turns NR; the present analysis assumes that NR &frac14; NS. Much like with power
transformers, the sum of stator and rotor currents im &frac14; is &thorn; iR can be called and
treated asmagnetizing current. Now, one canwriteCR &frac14; LgRIR &thorn; LmIm,CS &frac14; LgsIs

<p>Steady state voltage balance equations for stator and rotor windings can be
</p>
<p>represented by the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 16.2. Voltage Us fed from the

the values obtained by applying the 3F/2F transform to the phase voltages ua, ub,

<p>and uc and then Park transform to obtain dq components. Phasors Is &frac14; Id &thorn; jIq and
IR &frac14; ID &thorn; jIQ determine the amplitudes and phases of the stator and rotor currents
at steady state. Resistance Rs and inductance Lgs represent the resistance and
</p>
<p>leakage inductance of the stator winding. Resistance RR and inductance LgR repre-
</p>
<p>sent the resistance and leakage inductance of the equivalent two-phase rotor
</p>
<p>winding that represent the rotor cage. Parameters RR and LgR are referred to the
</p>
<p>stator side. That means that the values of RR and LgR correspond to the equivalent
</p>
<p>two-phase rotor winding which has the same number of turns per phase as the stator
</p>
<p>windings, NS &frac14; NR. All further developments start with an assumption that the
rotor variables are referred to the stator side, namely, that short-circuited rotor cage
</p>
<p>is modeled by a pair of short-circuited windings aR and bR which have the same
</p>
<p>number of turns as the stator windings.
</p>
<p>Referring the rotor parameters to the stator side is similar to scaling the secondary

<p>circuit impedance of a power transformer to the primary side. With impedance Z2 of
</p>
<p>the secondary circuit, and with the transformation ratio of the power transformer
</p>
<p>m &frac14; N1/N2, the primary side equivalent of the secondary impedance becomesm2Z2.
With an induction motor, secondary winding of transformer is short-circuited rotor
</p>
<p>cage, while the stator phases represent the primary winding. Two diametrically
</p>
<p>positioned rotor bars can be considered as one-phase winding of the rotor. This
</p>
<p>phase winding has NR &frac14; 1 turns. Assume that resistance of this short-circuited turn
isR2 &frac14; 1mO and that the stator winding hasNS &frac14; 40 turns; the value RR of the rotor
resistance referred to the stator side becomes RR &frac14; 1 mO ∙ (NS/NR)2 &frac14; 1.6 O. The
assumption adopted in all the subsequent considerations is that the short-circuited
</p>
<p>cage is represented by a two-phase winding with NR &frac14; NS turns; thus, all rotor
variables are implicitly referred to the stator side.

<p>16.6 Analogy with Transformer
</p>
<p>The steady state equivalent circuit of induction machine can be determined by using
</p>
<p>the analogy with transformer, where the stator stands for primary winding of
</p>
<p>transformer, while the rotor represents short-circuited secondary. The stator of an
</p>
<p>induction machine has three-phase winding. Therefore, the analogy can be made
</p>
<p>with a three-phase transformer having short-circuited secondary.
</p>
<p>The difference in operation of an induction machine and a transformer is that the
</p>
<p>stator and rotor currents do not have the same angular frequency. The reason for that
</p>
<p>is the rotor motion. It is of interest to consider a two-pole inductionmachine supplied
</p>
<p>from symmetrical three-phase mains of the line frequency oe. Magnetic field of the
</p>
<p>machine revolves at the speed of Oe &frac14; oe. With locked rotor (Om &frac14; 0), the field
revolves at the same speed Oe with respect to both stator and rotor. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>angular frequency of electromotive forces induced in rotor cage is equal to the line
</p>
<p>frequency oe. The angular frequency of rotor electromotive forces and currents is
</p>
<p>also called slip frequency, and it is calculated asoslip &frac14; soe, where s &frac14; (Oe � Om)/
Oe is relative slip, which is equal to 1 in locked rotor conditions. Hence, in locked
</p>
<p>rotor conditions, an induction machine corresponds in full to a three-phase trans-
</p>
<p>former with short-circuited secondary windings. This situation changes when the
</p>
<p>rotor is set to motion and revolves at the speed Om &gt; 0. Since the rotor revolves in
the same direction as the field, the difference Oe � Om between the two speeds gets
smaller. Therefore, rotation of the field with respect to the rotor cage and conse-
</p>
<p>quential electromotive forces and currents has the frequency oslip &frac14; soe which is
smaller than the line frequency due to s &lt; 1. Due to rotor motion, inductionmachine
operates as three-phase transformer with short-circuited secondary which revolves
</p>
<p>with respect to the primary and, therefore, has the electrical currents of reduced
</p>
<p>angular frequency oslip &frac14; soe. The presence of different frequencies in stator and
rotor circuits is an obstacle to deriving an equivalent circuit that would represent the
</p>
<p>whole machine. Further considerations are directed to this aim.
</p>
<p>The resultant magnetomotive force and flux Cm in the air gap arise due to
</p>
<p>electrical currents of both the stator and rotor windings. The sum of the stator and
</p>
<p>rotor currents Im &frac14; IS &thorn; IR represents the magnetizing current, the same way as the
sum Im &frac14; I1 &thorn; I20 of the primary current I1 and secondary current I20 &frac14; (N2/N1)I2
represents the magnetizing current of the transformer. In transformers, I2
</p>
<p>0 &frac14; (N2/
N1)I2 represents the primary side equivalent of the secondary current, or the
</p>
<p>secondary current referred to the primary side. In induction machine model, the
</p>
<p>rotor cage is replaced by equivalent short-circuited winding with the same number
</p>
<p>of turns as the stator phases, thus NS &frac14; NR, which permits the magnetizing current
to be written as Im &frac14; IS &thorn; IR. Multiplying the magnetizing current by the number
of turns gives the resultant magnetomotive force in the machine, Fm &frac14; FS &thorn; FR,
which is the sum of the magnetomotive forces of the stator and rotor windings.
</p>
<p>Mutual flux is also called air-gap flux, it encircles both stator and rotor windings, it
</p>
<p>passes through the air gap, and it is calculated from expression Fm &frac14; Fm/Rm, where
Rm represents magnetic resistance and Fm is the mutual flux in one turn.
</p>
<p>16.6 Analogy with Transformer 435</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Mutual flux of the windingCm is obtained by adding up the mutual flux linkages
</p>
<p>of individual turns. With concentrated windings, where all the turns reside in the
</p>
<p>same place and, hence, have the same flux Fm, the winding flux is obtained as
</p>
<p>Cm &frac14; NNFm, where NN represents the number of turns. For windings with sinusoi-
dal distribution of conductors, individual turns do not reside at the same place and
</p>
<p>do not have the same flux. The winding flux is obtained by integration, as explained
</p>
<p>in introductory chapters, resulting in Cm &frac14; (p/4)NNFm. In the stator phase
windings of an induction machine, the flux has sinusoidal change at the angular
</p>
<p>frequency of the supply voltages. Mains supplied machines have the line frequency
</p>
<p>oe. The electromotive force induced in the stator windings due to rotation of the
</p>
<p>mutual fluxCm is ES &frac14; Um &frac14; joeCm. The voltageUm is calledmagnetizing branch
voltage, as it appears across the element Lm in Fig. 16.3. The voltage balance
</p>
<p>equation of the stator winding is US &frac14; RSIS &thorn; joeLgSIS &thorn; ES, and it is illustrated
in Fig. 16.3.
</p>
<p>Since NS &frac14; NR, the same mutual flux Cm exists in short-circuited rotor turns.
The mutual flux in rotor turns has sinusoidal change. The flux revolves with respect
</p>
<p>to the rotor at slip speed Oslip. Therefore, the frequency of the flux changes is oslip.
</p>
<p>The flux changes result in the rotor electromotive force ER &frac14; sUm &frac14; joslipCm. The
voltage balance equation of the rotor cage is UR &frac14; 0 &frac14; RRIR &thorn; joslip LgR IR &thorn; ER,
and it is shown in the Fig. 16.4.
</p>
<p>All the impedances of the rotor equivalent circuit in Fig. 16.4 can be divided by the
</p>
<p>relative slip s &frac14; oslip/oe, while maintaining the circuit topology and leaving all the
currents unchanged. Modified circuit will have the voltages divided by s as well as

<p>the impedances. Resistance of the rotor branch takes the value RR/s. Reactances
</p>
<p>oslipL obtain new values oeL due to oslip/s &frac14; oe. In this manner, a new numerical
value of the angular frequency becomes oe, which facilitates connecting the rotor
</p>
<p>and stator circuits (Figs. 16.3, 16.4). The voltages in the rotor circuit are increased 1/s
</p>
<p>times; thus, the electromotive force ER &frac14; sUm becomes equal to Um. After division
of impedances by the relative slip s, the rotor equivalent circuit becomes as shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.5.
</p>
<p>By connecting the equivalent stator circuit to the equivalent rotor circuit where
</p>
<p>the impedances are multiplied by 1/s, one obtains the equivalent circuit shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.6. It represents the steady-state relations of currents, voltages, and flux

<p>16.7 Torque and Current Calculation
</p>
<p>The rotor branch of the equivalent circuit comprises a speed-dependent resistance
</p>
<p>RR/s. Relative slip s &frac14; (Oe � Om)/Oe &frac14; oslip/oe depends on the rotor speed, which
results in changes of the resistance RR/s with the rotor speed. Therefore, electrical
</p>
<p>currents in branches of the equivalent circuit as well as the power depend on the
</p>
<p>rotor speed. The equivalent circuit can be used to find the relation between the rotor
</p>
<p>speed and the air-gap power. The air-gap power can be used to calculate the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque Tem &frac14; Pd/Oe at steady state and to determine mechanical
characteristic Tem(Om). In order to complete this task, it is necessary to analyze
</p>
<p>the equivalent circuit and calculate the steady state value of the air-gap power.
</p>
<p>Equation (16.2) expresses the air-gap power as function of flux linkages and
</p>
<p>currents in dq coordinate system. Variables in (16.2) can be related to the equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit in Fig. 16.6 due to US � RSIS &frac14; joeCS &frac14; joe(Cd + jCq).
Both the mathematical model and the equivalent circuit have been derived
</p>
<p>by neglecting the iron losses. At steady state, the source power is equal to (3/2)
</p>
<p>Re(US IS
*) &frac14; (3/2) (UdId &thorn; UqIq) &frac14; Pcu1 &thorn; Pd &frac14; (3/2)RsIs2 &thorn; Pd, where ampli-
</p>
<p>tude of phasor jIsj corresponds to the peak value of the phase current ia(t). By
careful examination of the equivalent circuit, it is possible to note that the source
</p>
<p>power Pe is partially spent on losses in the stator winding, while the remaining
</p>
<p>power Pe � (3/2)RsIs2 is dissipated across the resistance RR/s of the equivalent
circuit. Therefore, air-gap power Pd can be determined from the equivalent circuit
</p>
<p>as Pd &frac14; 3/2 (RR/s) IR2, where IR2 &frac14; ID2 &thorn; IQ2. The electromagnetic torque is

</p>
<p>Under assumptions, the rotor current IR has phase advance of p/2 with respect to

and Im
</p>
<p>2 � IR2, the amplitude of the stator current is approximately equal to the
amplitude of the rotor current, IR

electromagnetic torque is Tem &frac14; 3RRIS2/(2sOe), while approximate value of the air-
gap power is Pd &frac14; 3/2 (RR/s) IS2.
Question (16.3): The leading coefficient K of Clarke 3F/2F transform is equal to
2/3. Discuss the relation between the stator current IS and the phase currents iaS(t)
</p>
<p>and ibS(t). Relate the expression for the air-gap power Pd &frac14; 3/2 (RR/s) IS2 to the
expression uaia &thorn; ubib &thorn; ucic for the power of the three-phase winding system.
Answer (16.3): One of the properties of Clarke transform with K &frac14; 2/3 is that all
the variables have the same peak values in the original abc domain and in the two-
</p>
<p>phase aS�bS coordinate system. Therefore, if the rms value Irms of stator currents ia,
ib, and ic is known, then the peak value of phase currents iaS(t) and ibS(t) of the two-
</p>

</p>
<p>be determined by the following procedure:
</p>

<p>Value of electromagnetic torque is equal to the quotient of the air-gap power and
</p>
<p>the revolution speed of the magnetic field, also called synchronous speed and
</p>
<p>denoted by Oe. Considered so far are the two-pole induction machines, where the
</p>
<p>phase windings a, b, and c are spatially shifted by 2p/3. With phase currents ia, ib,
</p>
<p>and ic of the same amplitude and the same angular frequency oe and with initial
</p>
<p>phases displaced by 2p/3, two-pole induction machine has magnetic field which
</p>
<p>revolves at the speed of Oe &frac14; oe and which has two diametrical magnetic poles,
displaced by p. Every set of windings that creates magnetic field having one north
</p>
<p>pole and one south pole is called two-pole winding. There are ways to construct the
</p>
<p>winding system which creates magnetic field with multiple pairs of magnetic poles.
</p>
<p>With phase windings made of two or more part distributions along the machine
</p>
<p>circumference, it is possible to create magnetic field with two or more pole pairs. In
</p>
<p>general, stator winding could have 2p magnetic poles, where p determines the
</p>
<p>number of pole pairs. Induction machines analyzed so far have p &frac14; 1 pole pairs,
resulting in Oe &frac14; oe.
</p>
<p>Magnetic field of machines with multiple-pole pairs revolves slower than the
</p>
<p>field of two-pole machines. Synchronous speed in an induction machine with
</p>
<p>p &gt; 1 pairs of poles is equal to Oe &frac14; oe/p. A more detailed analysis of the
multipole machines and distribution of their magnetic fields will be carried out
</p>
<p>further on. Unless otherwise stated, it is assumed that induction machine under the
</p>
<p>scope is a two-pole machine (p &frac14; 1) withOe &frac14; oe, where the symboloe represents
electrical frequency of currents and voltages while Oe stands for the angular speed
</p>
<p>of the magnetic field. Notwithstanding the number of magnetic poles, the electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic torque is the quotient of the air-gap power and the angular speed of the

tion machine starting from the steady state equivalent circuit. The assumption

Answer (16.4): The electromagnetic torque is determined as the ratio of the air-gap

<p>16.9 Relative Values
</p>
<p>Absolute values of winding resistances and reactances X &frac14; Lo are expressed in
ohms. Parameter RS &frac14; 1 O alone does not provide the grounds to estimate the
voltage drop across the stator resistance, nor it helps judging on the stator copper
</p>
<p>losses. For that to achieve, other information, such as the rated voltage and the rated
</p>
<p>current are needed as well. Relative value of the stator resistance provides more
</p>
<p>information in this regard. The relative or normalized value of variables and
</p>
<p>parameters are dimensionless numbers obtained by dividing the absolute value by
</p>
<p>the base value. Hence, the base value is considered to be 100% or 1 per unit, also
</p>
<p>designated by 1 [p.u.]. Assuming that the base value for the machine impedances is
</p>
<p>ZB &frac14; 2 O, while the stator resistance is RS &frac14; 1 O, it is possible to find the relative
value of the stator resistance as rS &frac14; RS/ZB &frac14; 0.5 p.u. or 50%.
</p>
<p>442 16 Induction Machines at Steady State</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>To facilitate estimation of copper losses of the stator winding and the voltage
</p>
<p>drop across the stator resistance, the base value for the machine impedances is often
</p>
<p>selected as ZB &frac14; Zn &frac14; Un/In, wherein the rated values of the voltage Un and current
In of the electrical machine should be known. For a motor having Un &frac14; 220V,
In &frac14; 2.2A, and resistance RS &frac14; 1O, the relative value of the stator resistance is
rS &frac14; 0.01. In rated operating conditions, the voltage drop RSIn corresponds to 1% of
the rated voltage, while the copper losses correspond to 1% of the rated power.
</p>
<p>Whatever the size and type of electrical machine, the information on rS provides the
</p>
<p>grounds to estimate the relative value of the voltage drop and the relative value of
</p>
<p>the copper losses in the winding. The absolute value of RS cannot be used for the
</p>
<p>same purpose unless additional information on the machine is made available. As
</p>
<p>an example, the motor with the same resistance RS &frac14; 1O but with Un &frac14; 110V and
In &frac14; 22A has a quite large voltage drop RSIn, corresponding to 20% of the rated
voltage.
</p>
<p>The voltage drop and the copper losses in the stator winding are determined in a
</p>
<p>direct manner by the relative value of the stator resistance. This value is denoted
</p>
<p>either by rS or by RS
rel. If the base value of the impedance is determined from rated
</p>
<p>voltages and currents, ZB[O] &frac14; Zn[O] &frac14; Un[V]/In[A], relative value of the stator
resistance is equal to rS &frac14; RSrel &frac14; RS[O]/Zn[O]. Since rS &frac14; RSIn/Un &frac14; RSIn2/(UnIn)
&frac14; RSIn2/Sn, it can be concluded that relative value of the stator resistance rS &frac14; 0.01
indicates that the rated current causes a voltage drop across the stator resistance of
</p>
<p>1% of the rated voltage and that the copper losses of the stator amount 1% of the
</p>
<p>rated apparent power Sn. The base value of impedance is usually determined as the
</p>
<p>ratio of the rms values of the phase voltages and currents:

<p>Currents and voltages of the stator and rotor are normalized (made relative) on

<p>the basis of the rated values; thus, relative value of 1%, or 100%, corresponds to the

<p>In doing so, it is understood that the rms value of the voltage US gets divided by
</p>
<p>the rated rms valueUn. It is also possible to take the peak value of the stator voltage,
</p>
<p>but in this case, it should be divided by the peak value of the rated voltage. Thus, the
</p>
<p>rms value of 110V can be divided by the rated rms value of 220V, obtaining
</p>
<p>uS &frac14; 0.5. The same result is obtained by dividing the peak values of corresponding
voltages, 155.56/311.12 &frac14; 0.5.

<p>Relative value of the flux is obtained by dividing the amplitude of the flux vector
</p>
<p>by the flux base value CB. The amplitude of the flux vector is the flux of the
</p>
<p>corresponding winding. The base value CB is obtained by dividing the peak value
</p>
<p>of the rated voltage Un(max) and the rated angular frequency on. The flux base value
</p>
<p>is obtained from the voltage balance equation in the phase winding of the stator,
</p>
<p>ua &frac14; Raia &thorn; dCa/dt. Neglecting the voltage drop across the stator resistance, one
obtains ua &frac14; dCa/dt. Assuming that the flux has the peak value ofCS and that it has
sinusoidal change of the frequency ofoS, the peak voltage across the phase winding
</p>
<p>is US(max) &frac14; CSoS. Therefore, the base value CB is derived as Un(max)/on.
While the steady state voltages and currents are normalized to their rms values,
</p>
<p>the flux is referred to its peak, maximum value. The change of the flux in each phase
</p>
<p>winding is sinusoidal at steady state. Therefore, it is possible to define and use the
</p>
<p>rms value of the flux. Yet, this approach is seldom used. Further considerations
</p>
<p>assume that the stator and rotor fluxesCS and CR correspond to their maximum
</p>
<p>values. The peak value of the stator flux corresponds to the amplitude of the stator
</p>
<p>flux vector, and it is obtained asCS
2 &frac14; CaS2 &thorn; CbS2. The flux normalization is
</p>
<p>performed by dividing the absolute value with the base value CB, which
</p>
<p>corresponds to the maximum value of the flux in each phase winding of the machine
</p>
<p>that operates with rated voltages and with the rated frequency. The base valueCB is
</p>
<p>very close to the rated value Cn of the flux, which is, at the same time, the knee
</p>
<p>point of the magnetizing curve. There is a very small difference between the two,
</p>
<p>caused by the voltage drops that make the product onCn slightly lower than the
</p>
<p>peak phase voltage Un(max). This is due to a finite value of the voltage drop across
</p>
<p>the stator resistance RSIS which makes the electromotive force in the stator winding
</p>
<p>444 16 Induction Machines at Steady State</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>different than the winding voltage. As a consequence, the relative value of the rated
</p>
<p>fluxCn is slightly lower than 1. Hence, the peak stator flux of an induction machine
</p>
<p>operating in steady state under rated conditions is slightly lower than CB, resulting
</p>
<p>in Cn/CB &lt; 1.
Steady state peak values of flux linkages can be obtained from the steady state
</p>
<p>equivalent circuit in Fig. 16.6. If the voltage phasorUS has the absolute value which

<p>Relative value of the rotor speed is usually determined as Om
rel &frac14; omrel &frac14; Om/
</p>
<p>Oen &frac14; om/oen, where oen is the rated supply frequency while Oen is the rated
synchronous speed. This choice of the speed base value allows the slip s to be
</p>
<p>calculated as s &frac14; 1 � Omrel. On the other hand, with rated operating conditions,
normalized rotor speed is lower than 1 due to On &lt; Oe. The value On/OS &frac14; 1 � sn
is slightly lower than 1, and the difference is the rated relative slip, sn. Instead of
</p>
<p>selecting the rated synchronous speed Oen as the base speed, it is also possible to
</p>
<p>choose the rated speed On, slightly lower than the rated synchronous speed. In this
</p>
<p>case, the relative speed of rotation is determined as Om
rel &frac14; Om/On. The rated
</p>
<p>synchronous speed would be greater than one. This approach is rarely encountered,
</p>
<p>and the base speed is mostly selected to be the rated synchronous speed.
</p>
<p>Relative value of the electromagnetic torque is determined by dividing the
</p>
<p>absolute value (the value expressed in [Nm]) by the selected base value TB [Nm].
</p>
<p>For the base value of the torque, it is possible to select the rated torque Tn. This
</p>
<p>results in the rated torque having the relative value of 1 (100%). Taking the rated
</p>
<p>torque for the base value has certain shortcomings. The product Pn &frac14; TnOn
provides the rated output power of the machine. At the same time, Pn &frac14;
Sn∙cos&rsquo;n∙�n, where Sn is the rated apparent power, cos&rsquo;n is the power factor in
rated conditions, while �n is the rated efficiency. Hence, the choice TB &frac14; Tn
requires the rated efficiency and the rated power factor to be known and taken
</p>
<p>into account. Therefore, in most cases, the base value of the torque is chosen as
</p>
<p>TB &frac14; Sn[VA]/On[rad/s] &gt; Tn, where Sn &frac14; 3U(f)nI(f)n is the rated value of the appar-
ent power of induction machine, while On &frac14; on/p is the rated synchronous speed.
</p>

<p>Question (16.5): Prove that the relation cos(&rsquo;n) �n/(1 � sn) &lt; 1 holds for any
three-phase induction machine.
</p>
<p>Answer (16.5): For an induction machine that operates in rated conditions, the air-
gap power Pd is obtained by subtracting the stator copper losses and the stator iron
</p>
<p>losses from the source power, Pd &frac14; Pen � Pcu1 � PFe1. The air-gap power is
divided in two parts: the losses in the rotor windings snPd and the internal mechani-
</p>
<p>cal power PmR &frac14; (1 � sn)Pd which is converted from electrical to mechanical
form. This power is equal to PmR &frac14; Tem On. The torque Tem &gt; Tn is slightly higher
than the rated torque due to losses caused by friction and ventilation. Assuming that
</p>
<p>the stator copper losses Pcu1, the stator iron losses PFe1, and the losses due to
</p>
<p>friction and ventilation are negligible, relation between the input and output power
</p>
<p>reduces to Pn &frac14; Pen(1 � sn), while the efficiency becomes �n &frac14; (1 � sn). Taking
into account all the losses mentioned as negligible, it is concluded that �n &lt; (1 � sn).
At the same time, cos(&rsquo;n) &lt; 1; thus, the original statement has been proved. As
a consequence, relative value of the rated torque obtained by normalizing Tn with
</p>
<p>the base value of TB &frac14; Sn/Oen is less than one.

</p>
<p>The choice of the base value for the electromagnetic torque TB &frac14; Sn/Oen has the
consequence of Tn

one. As an example, the relative value of the torque at rated operating conditions
</p>
<p>may be equal to 0.9% or 90%. Advantages of choosing TB &frac14; Sn/Oen instead of
TB &frac14; Tn are more obvious from the expression which determines the relative torque

The vector product of the stator current and flux vectors, both with amplitude close

<p>KRM &frac14; 1 would require this angle to be p/2, which is not feasible in steady state
operation with rated supply and rated speed. The angle between the stator flux

</p>
<p>The steady-state angle between the two vectors is determined by the phase differ-
</p>
<p>ence between corresponding phasors, represented within the equivalent circuit. The
</p>
<p>phase of the stator flux is close to the phase of the magnetizing flux and, hence, the

<p>phase of the magnetizing current. Neglecting the rotor leakage inductance, the rotor
</p>
<p>current is leading by p/2 with respect to the magnetizing current. The stator current
</p>
<p>is the sum of the two, IS &frac14; Im &thorn; IR1. Therefore, it leads with respect to the flux by
an angle which cannot be p/2 due to Im 6&frac14; 0.

<p>Question (16.6): Estimate the angle between the stator flux and the stator current
of an induction machine at rated operating conditions. Use the equivalent circuit to
</p>
<p>find the phase difference between the flux phasor and the current phasor. In doing
</p>
<p>so, consider that the difference between the stator voltage and the voltage across
</p>
<p>magnetizing branch is negligible.
</p>
<p>Answer (16.6): Starting from steady state equivalent circuit, the estimate of the
angle can be obtained by neglecting the voltage drop across the stator series
</p>
<p>impedance (RS &thorn; joeLgS)IS. The voltage across magnetizing branch Um &frac14; joeCm
� US &frac14; joeCS is then approximately equal to the supply voltage; thus, the
magnetizing flux is considered approximately equal to the stator flux Cm � CS.
Stator current is equal to the sum of the magnetizing current Im and the rotor current
</p>
<p>IR1 &frac14; �IR. The initial phase and spatial orientation of the flux Cm � CS is deter-
mined by the initial phase of magnetizing current Im. The rotor current IR1 is equal
</p>
<p>to the voltage Um &frac14; joeCm divided by the rotor impedance (RR/s &thorn; joeLgR). The
slip s &frac14; sn is significantly smaller than 1; thus, RR/s � oeLgR. Therefore, the rated
value of the rotor impedance is mainly resistive, and the phase lagging of the
</p>
<p>current IR1 with respect to the voltage Um is relatively small. With tg(y) � y, this
phase lag is approximately equal to snoeLgR/RR rad. It can be concluded that the
</p>
<p>phase lead of the rotor current IR1 with respect to Im is somewhat smaller than p/2.
</p>
<p>With the stator and rotor currents significantly larger than the magnetizing current,
</p>
<p>the stator current IS &frac14; IR1 &thorn; Im will also lead with respect to Im and with respect to
the stator flux Cm � CS. This phase lead is close to p/2. It is larger in cases where
the magnetizing current is smaller, but it never reaches p/2.
</p>
<p>* * *
</p>
<p>Preceding analysis shows that during rated operating mode of an induction
</p>
<p>machine, the angle between the stator flux and current cannot reach the value of
</p>
<p>p/2. Therefore, the coefficient KRM of (16.20) is greater than 1. This coefficient can
</p>
<p>be expressed as function of &rsquo;n, �n, and sn. Coefficient KRM is required for the torque
normalization according to expression Tem
</p>
<p>rel &frac14; KRM (Cdrel∙iqrel � Cdrel∙idrel),
where the flux linkages and electrical currents are expressed in relative units.
</p>
<p>Calculation of KRM presents a difficulty as the values &rsquo;n, �n, and sn are machine
specific and they change from one machine to another. For this reason, preferred
</p>
<p>torque normalization does not use the base value of TB &frac14; Tn. Instead, the value of
TB &frac14; Sn/Oen is used.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of selecting TB &frac14; Sn/Oen, the formula that calculates the
relative torque in terms of relative flux linkages and relative currents becomes
</p>
<p>rather simple. This formula is developed in (16.21), where Un and In represent the
</p>
<p>rms values of the rated voltages and currents. The torque expression makes the use
</p>
<p>of dq variables Cd, iq, Cq, and id. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce relative
</p>
<p>values for the flux and current components in dq frame. With Clarke transform
</p>
<p>having the leading coefficient of 2/3, the peak values of the phase currents corre-
</p>
<p>spond to the amplitude of the stator current in dq frame, (id
2 &thorn; iq2)0.5. At the same
</p>
<p>time, the maximum value of the flux linkage in one phase corresponds to the
</p>
<p>amplitude of the flux in dq frame. Therefore, relative values of id and iq are

<p>The formula (16.21) does not make use of any coefficients such as KRM, 3/2, or p.
</p>
<p>The relative torque is obtained as the vector product of normalized stator current
</p>
<p>and normalized stator flux, both expressed in dq coordinate frame. Whenever the
</p>
<p>need appears to express the absolute torque, expressed in [Nm], the relative torque
</p>
<p>should be multiplied by TB &frac14; Sn/Oen, which makes all the analysis with TB &frac14; Sn/
Oen rather simple. The only disadvantage is the circumstance that the relative value
</p>
<p>of the rated torque is inferior to one, Tn
rel &lt; 1, that is, lower than 100%.
</p>
<p>The problem of selecting the base value for the torque of AC machines is
</p>
<p>different than the problem of selecting TB with DC machines. The input power to
</p>
<p>the armature winding of DC machines is equal to the product of the armature
</p>
<p>current and the armature voltage. This product does not have to be multiplied
</p>
<p>with the power factor cos&rsquo;, which is the case in AC machines. The absence of
power factor cos&rsquo; in DC machines makes the calculations of power and torque less
involved.

<p>16.11 Parameters of Equivalent Circuit
</p>
<p>The analysis of steady state equivalent circuit requires the knowledge of parameters

<p>RS, RR, LgS, LgR, and Lm. It is of interest to have a basic idea of their range and to
</p>
<p>learn about practical ways to measure relevant parameters and/or to calculate
</p>
<p>parameters from data declared on the machine nameplate.
</p>
<p>Stator resistance of a star-connected winding can be determined by connecting
two of the three stator terminals to a DC power supply. By measuring DC voltage
</p>
<p>between the terminals, one obtains the sum of voltage drops in two-phase windings,
</p>
<p>2RSIDC &frac14; UDC/IDC. Relative value of stator resistance RS is usually larger with
small machines, and it drops down as the machine power increases. With induction
</p>
<p>machines rated a couple of hundreds of Watts, relative value of RS is close to 10%.
</p>
<p>For induction machine in excess to 300 kW, relative value of the stator resistance
</p>
<p>can be as low as 0.1%.

<p>Question (16.7): What is the reason that makes the relative value of winding
resistances smaller for large power machines?
</p>
<p>16.11 Parameters of Equivalent Circuit 449</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Answer (16.7): In electrical machines, there are losses in magnetic circuits and in
current circuits, also called iron losses and copper losses. Specific power of iron
</p>
<p>losses is the iron loss per unit volume or unit mass of the magnetic circuit. It
</p>
<p>depends on magnetic induction Bm and frequency of the field changes in considered
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit. Considering two electrical machines with the same flux density
</p>
<p>(induction B) and the same frequency, then the specific power of iron losses has the
</p>
<p>same values in both machines. Therefore, the ratio of PFe1 and PFe2 is determined
</p>
<p>by the ratio of volumes of respective magnetic circuits V1f/V2f, or by the ratio of
</p>
<p>their masses m1f/m2f.
</p>
<p>Specific power of losses in copper is the amount of loss power per unit volume or
</p>
<p>unit mass, and it is dependent on current density [A/mm2] and specific conductivity
</p>
<p>s of the metal (copper) used to make the conductors. Considering two electrical
</p>
<p>machines with the same current density and with conductors made of the same
</p>
<p>material (copper), their specific power of copper losses is equal. The ratio of PCu1
and PCu2 is dependent on the quantity of the material used to make the windings,
</p>
<p>namely, the ratio PCu1/PCu2 is determined by the ratio of volumes V1Cu/V2Cu or mass
</p>
<p>m1Cu/m2Cu of the copper used in making respective windings.
</p>
<p>If one of the two machines has diameter which is two times larger and it has
</p>
<p>twice the length of the other, smaller machine, its volume is eight times larger
</p>
<p>(V ~ l3) than the volume of the smaller machine. At the same time, assumption is
</p>
<p>made that the two machines are similar and that both magnetic circuit and the
</p>
<p>windings of the larger machine are obtained by starting from relevant parts of the
</p>
<p>smaller machine and doubling their linear dimensions. Assuming that both
</p>
<p>machines have the same current density, the same induction Bm, and the same
</p>
<p>operating frequency f, then the power of losses of the larger machine is eight times
</p>
<p>higher.
</p>
<p>Losses of energy in the magnetic and current circuits of electrical machines
</p>
<p>generate heat which increases temperatures of the vital parts of the machine.
</p>
<p>Maintaining integrity and functionality of machine parts such as the electrical insula-
</p>
<p>tion of the windings, ferromagnetic materials, bearings, and other parts requires
</p>
<p>containing the machine temperature within safe limits. Excessive temperatures can
</p>
<p>cause permanent damage to vital parts of the machine. Therefore, it is necessary to
</p>
<p>provide cooling that removes excess heat and keeps the machine temperature within
</p>
<p>safe limits. At steady state, when the machine temperature sets to a constant value, the
</p>
<p>heat created by the conversion losses within the machine is equal to the heat removed
</p>
<p>by cooling. Different cooling methods such as convection, conduction, and radiation
</p>
<p>remove the amount of heat which depends on the temperature difference between the
</p>
<p>machine and the surrounding environment. The heat transfer is also proportional to the
</p>
<p>surface area of the machine parts getting in touch with the environment and also the
</p>
<p>contact area with the cooling fluids. The surface is proportional to S ~ l2. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the larger machine with doubled diameter and twice the axial length can be cooled
</p>
<p>with four times larger surface area than the smaller machine.
</p>
<p>It can be concluded that machines with l times larger linear dimensions have l3
</p>
<p>times higher losses, while their ability to remove heat is increased l2 times. Under
</p>
<p>circumstances, the temperature of the machine with l times larger linear dimensions
</p>
<p>450 16 Induction Machines at Steady State</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is going to increase l times. This statement relies on the assumption that the specific
</p>
<p>power of losses remains unaltered. The above consideration shows that larger
</p>
<p>machines require more efficient cooling methods and reduction of specific power
</p>
<p>of losses. For this reason, large machines are usually designed and made to have
</p>
<p>smaller values of magnetic induction Bm and smaller current densities in their
</p>
<p>windings. As a consequence, the windings are built of conductors with larger
</p>
<p>cross section, which results in smaller winding resistances. Therefore, relative
</p>
<p>value of the stator resistance is smaller for machines of larger power. It is necessary
</p>
<p>to note that the value RS
rel &frac14; 0.001, corresponding to machine of 1 MW, actually
</p>
<p>means that the copper losses in the stator winding have the power of 1 kW. Namely,
</p>
<p>the energy of 1,000 J is converted into heat in each second. Heat removal at rates of
</p>
<p>1,000 J per second may require forced cooling. Any further increase in RS would
</p>
<p>bring additional copper losses and result in an increase in the winding temperature
</p>
<p>that may damage electrical insulation.
</p>
<p>Ratio of the power of losses and cooling surface of smaller machines is much
</p>
<p>more favorable. Therefore, the problem of cooling is less emphasized, and there is
</p>
<p>no need to use more copper by increasing the cross section of conductors. For very
</p>
<p>small machines, relative values of RS in excess of 10% can be tolerated. This means
</p>
<p>that 10% of the rated power accounts for the copper losses, which introduces the
</p>
<p>question of energy efficiency. It is of interest to notice that many small electrical
</p>
<p>machines operate intermittently, such as the motors in hand dryers, and remain
</p>
<p>disconnected for most of the time. In such cases, the energy that has to be used to
</p>
<p>manufacture electrolytic copper required for the motor windings may be more
</p>
<p>significant than the energy lost in the copper losses during the machine lifetime.
</p>
<p>* * *
</p>
<p>Magnetizing inductance Lm determines the magnetizing current Im &frac14; IS &thorn; IR
which is required to achieve desired flux Cm &frac14; LmIm. With most induction
machines, magnetizing current Im is much smaller than the rated current. By
</p>
<p>analogy with power transformer, considering the stator as the primary winding
</p>
<p>and the rotor as the secondary winding, magnetizing current corresponds to no load
</p>
<p>current of the transformer, the current that circulates in primary winding when the
</p>
<p>secondary winding does not have any current. In the case when an induction
</p>
<p>machine is not coupled to mechanical load, the rotor revolves with no external
</p>
<p>resistance. The load torque TL is equal to zero. Internal mechanical losses such as
</p>
<p>the bearing friction and the air resistance are negligible in most cases. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the rotor revolves at the speed which is very close to the synchronous speed and the
</p>
<p>relative slip is s � 0. Impedance RR/s takes a very high value; thus, rotor current
can be neglected, and the rotor circuit can be considered open. The equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit of the induction machine reduces to a series connection of the stator
</p>
<p>resistance RS, the stator leakage inductance LgS, and the magnetizing inductance Lm.
</p>
<p>The experiment with an induction machine connected to the mains having the
</p>
<p>rated voltage and the rated frequency applies the rated supply to the stator windings.
</p>
<p>With shaft disconnected from any mechanical load or work machine, the rotor
</p>
<p>revolves at synchronous speed. Such experiment is called no load test. At steady

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>state, the stator current is equal to I0 &frac14; USn/(RS &thorn; joenLS). Neglecting the stator
resistance and the leakage inductance, one obtains LS � Lm � USn/(I0 oen).
</p>
<p>No load current of induction machines of small power is within range of 50&ndash;70%
</p>
<p>of the rated current. For high-power machines, no load current can be lower than
</p>
<p>20% of the rated current.
</p>
<p>Question (16.8): What is the reason that makes the relative no load current smaller
for high-power machines?
</p>
<p>Answer (16.8): High-power machines are designed to have smaller value of
magnetic induction Bm in their magnetic circuits. Cooling of high-power
</p>
<p>machines is more difficult. Therefore, they are designed to have smaller values
</p>
<p>of magnetic induction in iron parts and smaller current density in copper
</p>
<p>conductors. The slope DB/DH of the magnetizing characteristic of the ferromag-
</p>
<p>netic material (B&ndash;H curve) is higher in regions that are closer to the origin of the
</p>
<p>B&ndash;H plane. Consequently, magnetic permeability is higher, which reduces
</p>
<p>magnetic resistance RmFe of the iron parts of the magnetic circuit. Moreover,
</p>
<p>high-power machines have larger dimensions and more favorable ratio of the air
</p>
<p>gap d and machine diameter D. Due to smaller d/D ratio, the air-gap part of
</p>
<p>magnetic resistance is smaller. Smaller values of magnetic resistance result in
</p>
<p>higher values of inductance, which is inversely proportional to magnetic resis-
</p>
<p>tance due to L &frac14; N2/Rm. Self-inductance of the stator winding LS is proportional to
the ratio N2/Rm, while magnetizing inductance is slightly smaller due to Lm &frac14; kLS,
where coupling coefficient k is somewhat lower than one. It can be concluded that
</p>
<p>a lower magnetic resistance and improved d/D ratio of high-power machines
</p>
<p>result in higher relative values of their magnetizing inductance Lm and smaller
</p>
<p>relative values of their no load currents.
</p>
<p>* * *

NR is related to virtual, equivalent rotor winding which replaces the rotor cage.
</p>
<p>Therefore, in most cases, the stator and rotor leakage inductances can be considered

<p>equal,2 LgS � LgR. In cases where short-circuited rotor cage is represented by
equivalent rotor winding having the same number of turns as the stator, NS &frac14; NR,
all the rotor parameters are referred to the stator side without scaling due to the
</p>
<p>transfer ratio m &frac14; NS/NR &frac14; 1. Inductances of the stator and rotor are proportional
to squared number of turns and inversely proportional to magnetic resistance. The

</p>
<p>An approximate value of leakage inductances can be determined by the short-
</p>
<p>circuit test. During this test, the rotor of the induction machine is locked. It cannot
</p>
<p>move and its speed is equal to zero. During the test, the rotor motion is prevented by
</p>
<p>mechanical means. In locked rotor conditions, the relative slip is equal to one,
</p>
<p>s &frac14; 1. Impedance RR/s obtains relatively small value RR. By neglecting the
magnetizing current, the equivalent impedance of the motor becomes US/IS &frac14; RS
&thorn; RR &thorn; joeLgS &thorn; joeLgR. For machines with rated power in excess to 10 kW,
relative values of resistances RS and RR are very low, and they can be neglected.
</p>
<p>The leakage inductance is then determined as LgS � LgR &frac14; &frac12; US/(ISoe), where US
and IS are the rms values of the stator voltages and currents measured during the
</p>
<p>short-circuit test. With small machines, the winding resistance cannot be neglected.
</p>
<p>During the short-circuit test, it is necessary to determine the phase shift between the
</p>
<p>voltages and currents in order to distinguish between the real and imaginary parts of
</p>
<p>the short-circuit impedance ZK &frac14; RS &thorn; RR &thorn; joeLgS &thorn; joeLgR.
The short-circuit reactance oen(LgR &thorn; LgS) at rated conditions has the relative
</p>
<p>value that ranges from 0.05 up to 0.3. Smaller values are met in lower power low-
</p>
<p>voltage (400 V) machines, while higher values correspond to induction machines
</p>
<p>for medium voltages (6 kV) and powers of the order of 1 MW. In high-power and
</p>
<p>high-voltage machines, distances between conductors of stator and rotor windings
</p>
<p>are larger. Larger distances are necessary for the purposes of a more efficient
</p>
<p>cooling. At the same time, insulation between conductors has to withstand higher
</p>
<p>voltages, which contributes to an increased distance between conductors. As a
</p>
<p>consequence, the coupling coefficient k between stator and rotor windings is
</p>
<p>smaller, which increases leakage inductances due to LgS � LgR � (1 � k)LS:
</p>
<p>LgS &frac14; LS � Lm; LgR &frac14; LR � Lm: (16.22)
</p>
<p>The short-circuit reactance of an induction machine is approximately equal to
</p>
<p>the sum of the stator and rotor leakage reactances oen(LgR &thorn; LgS) &frac14; XgS &thorn; XgR.
A small difference between the actual short-circuit reactance Lgeoen and the sum of
</p>
<p>the stator and rotor leakage reactances exists due to a finite value of Lmoen.
</p>
<p>The actual value of the short-circuit reactance can be determined by considering
</p>
<p>equivalent transformer. The stator and rotor windings of an induction machine are
</p>
<p>coupled by magnetic field in the same way as the primary and secondary windings
</p>
<p>of a transformer. A short-circuited induction motor with RS, RR � oen(LgR &thorn; LgS)
is equivalent to a transformer with short-circuited secondary and with negligible
</p>
<p>winding resistances. The input (equivalent) inductance Lge &frac14; Xge/oen of a short-
circuited induction machine, also called the equivalent leakage inductance, can be
</p>
<p>calculated from the circuit in Fig. 16.7:

<p>The obtained expression is similar to the one for the input inductance Lu of a

<p>short-circuited transformer with known self-inductance of the primary winding
</p>
<p>(L1), self-inductance of the secondary winding (L2), and with mutual inductance
</p>
<p>M. This expression reads Lu &frac14; (L1L2 � M2)/L2. In the case when LgR � Lm, it can
be considered that (LgR &thorn; LgS) � Lge.
</p>
<p>Relative value of reactance Lgeoen is relatively small, within the range from 0.05
</p>
<p>up to 0.3. Relative value of the current is approximately equal to the ratio of the
</p>
<p>relative value of voltage and relative value of the short-circuit reactance. Therefore,
</p>
<p>by connecting the rated voltage to a short-circuited induction machine, one obtains
</p>
<p>currents which are much higher than the rated current. Due to high losses, operation
</p>
<p>of the machine with the locked rotor must be very short, in order to avoid undesir-
</p>
<p>able increase of temperature and damage of insulation. For this reason, the short-
</p>
<p>circuit test is usually performed with lower stator voltage, so as to achieve an
</p>
<p>acceptable stator current that would not damage the machine under the test. In the
</p>
<p>case when the short-circuit test is performed with the rated current (IS &frac14; 1 [p.u.]),
then the relative voltage across the winding is required to be US &frac14; Xge � 1. In the
case when the short-circuit experiment is performed with the rated voltage, the
</p>
<p>relative stator current is IS � 1/Xge and is much higher than the rated current. Even
the reactance obtained by the short-circuit experiment with rated voltage may be
</p>
<p>different from the reactance obtained by the short-circuit experiment performed
</p>
<p>with rated current. This difference can appear due to magnetic saturation which
</p>
<p>alters the magnetic resistance as well as the values of inductances. With very high
</p>
<p>stator currents, the leakage flux is high, and the magnetic induction B in the stator
</p>
<p>teeth may reach the saturation level. The teeth belong to the magnetic circuit of the
</p>
<p>leakage flux. Therefore, magnetic saturation of stator teeth reduces the leakage
</p>
<p>inductance and the leakage reactance. Similar conditions are met in the rotor circuit.
</p>
<p>During short-circuit test, the stator current is approximately equal to the rotor
</p>
<p>current IR1. Therefore, with large stator currents, the magnetic material on the
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>path of the rotor leakage flux reaches saturation, which leads to an increase of
</p>
<p>magnetic resistance and a decrease of the rotor leakage inductance. The short-
</p>
<p>circuit test with elevated currents demonstrates that the induction machine is a
</p>
<p>nonlinear system. Mathematical model and the equivalent circuit developed since
</p>
<p>describe the machine behavior provided that the modeling approximations are valid
</p>
<p>and that the machine operates with all the variables remaining reasonably close to
</p>
<p>rated conditions. In cases with very large currents, very large speeds, excessive slip
</p>
<p>frequencies, or excessive flux amplitudes, parameters of the steady state equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit cannot be considered constant. Moreover, even the steady state equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit may not be the adequate way to describe the machine behavior. Nonlinear
</p>
<p>phenomena in induction machines are intentionally kept out of this book.
</p>
<p>Resistance of the rotor winding referred to the stator side is denoted by RR.
Relative value of parameter RR is usually close to the relative value of RS. In low-
</p>
<p>power machines, relative RR is close to 10%, while for induction machines in excess
</p>
<p>to 1 MW, it could be as low as RR � 0.1%. In essence, the actual resistance of the
rotor bars can hardly be measured. Yet, parameter RR in the equivalent circuit could
</p>
<p>be determined from the equivalent circuit. With known US and IS, and with all the
</p>
<p>parameters of the equivalent circuit known, except for RR/s, it is possible to
</p>
<p>calculate the value of RR/s expressed in [O]. Provided that the rotor speed is
</p>
<p>available as well, one can calculate the relative slip and obtain precise value of
</p>
<p>the rotor resistance. The following considerations provide the means for finding a
</p>
<p>quick estimate of the rotor resistance.
</p>
<p>16.11.1 Rotor Resistance Estimation
</p>
<p>The rotor resistance RR can be calculated from the impedance obtained by the
</p>
<p>locked rotor test. This impedance is ZK � RS &thorn; RR &thorn; joeLgS &thorn; joeLgR. Taking the
real part of the locked rotor test and subtracting the stator resistance, it is possible to
</p>
<p>obtain the parameter RR which makes part of the short-circuit impedance. This
</p>
<p>value may be different than the resistance encountered by the rotor currents having
</p>
<p>the rated slip frequency. In the locked rotor test, the rotor currents have the
</p>
<p>line frequency, the same as the stator currents. At rated operating conditions, the
</p>
<p>frequency of rotor currents ranges from fslip ~ 0.5 to fslip ~ 5 Hz. Due to relatively
</p>
<p>large cross section of rotor conductors, the skin effect is emphasized even at the line
</p>
<p>frequency. The skin effect in rotor bars consists in pushing the rotor currents toward
</p>
<p>the air gap and reducing the currents deep in the rotor slots. This uneven distribution
</p>
<p>of currents leads to an increase in the rotor equivalent resistance at elevated
</p>
<p>frequencies. Therefore, the rotor resistance at fslip &frac14; 50 Hz, measured in the
short-circuit test, is considerably higher than the rotor resistance at rated slip
</p>
<p>frequency.
</p>
<p>Another way of estimating the parameter RR is based on determining the time
</p>
<p>constant of the rotor circuit, tR &frac14; LR/RR. The rotor time constant tR can be
</p>
<p>16.11 Parameters of Equivalent Circuit 455</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>determined from the voltage change between the two terminals of the stator
</p>
<p>winding. This voltage change has to be measured after disconnecting the machine
</p>
<p>from the mains. In this case, the voltage between the stator terminals reflects the
</p>
<p>changes of the induced electromotive force, proportional to the rotor flux. In the
</p>
<p>prescribed conditions, the flux decays with the time constant tR, which provides the
</p>
<p>grounds for RR estimation. Before commencing with measurement, induction
</p>
<p>machine should be running with no load (TL &frac14; 0), connected to the mains which
provides the rated voltage of the rated frequency. It is assumed that the machine
</p>
<p>accelerated up to the synchronous speed, that the steady state has been established,
</p>
<p>and that the torque, power, and slip are close to zero, while the magnetic circuits has
</p>
<p>the rated flux. At this point, a safe, isolated voltage probe3 should be connected
</p>
<p>between the two terminals of the stator windings, bringing the line voltage to a
</p>
<p>digital storage oscilloscope. Upon disconnecting the machine from the mains, the
</p>
<p>stator currents drop to zero. Considering the equivalent circuit, the stator contour
</p>
<p>remains open, while the remaining rotor current circulates through the magnetizing
</p>
<p>branch. Hence, the residual rotor current provides the magnetizing current and
</p>
<p>supports the flux. The short-circuited rotor cage opposes to any change of the flux,
</p>
<p>attempting to preserve the flux found at the instant of disconnecting the mains. The
</p>
<p>rotor counter electromotive forces and currents are induced to oppose to the flux
</p>
<p>change. It is of interest to study the change of the rotor current at the instant of
</p>
<p>disconnecting the mains. Considering the equivalent circuit prior to disconnection,
</p>
<p>the rotor current was close to zero, while the stator current was equal to the
</p>
<p>magnetizing current Im. Disconnecting the stator winding from the mains cuts the
</p>
<p>stator current down to zero,4 while the magnetizing current shifts into the rotor
</p>
<p>circuit. The rotor circuit is established due to short-circuited cage attempting to
</p>
<p>maintain the flux unaltered. Hence, although the machine is disconnected from the
</p>
<p>mains, the magnetizing flux is maintained by the rotor cage. Therefore, residual flux
</p>
<p>revolves within the machine at the rotor speed, which remains close to the synchro-
</p>
<p>nous speed. At first, there are no significant changes of the flux amplitude.
</p>
<p>Electromotive force Cmoe is induced in the stator windings. It has the amplitude
</p>
<p>close to the rated voltage, the frequency close to the supply frequency, and it can be
</p>
<p>measured between the open stator terminals. It is assumed that, in the absence of
</p>
<p>mechanical load, the rotor speed remains constant throughout the experiment.
</p>
<p>3The instant of opening the switch which connects the stator winding to the mains may result in
</p>
<p>transient overvoltages across the contacts being opened and across the voltage probe. Therefore, it
</p>
<p>is advisable to use the probe that withstands the voltages in excess to the rated voltages. With
</p>
<p>0.4 kV machines, a 10 kV probe would do. The probe has to be passed through the insulator which
</p>
<p>secures galvanic insulation between the motor terminals and the oscilloscope, where the later has
</p>
<p>to be connected to protective ground for safety.
4 It may take up to a couple of milliseconds to open the switch contacts and extinguish the electric
</p>
<p>arc between the opened contacts, which eventually brings the stator current to zero. The arcing
</p>
<p>cannot be avoided, and it is more emphasized when the leakage inductance is larger. As a matter of
</p>
<p>fact, the arcing burns the energy of the leakage flux,Wge ~ LgeiS
2. The switch opening time is very
</p>
<p>short compared to the machine dynamics, and it is neglected in the present discussion.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>By time, the amplitude of this electromotive force gradually decays. Since the stator
</p>
<p>circuit is open, the rotor current and, hence, the magnetizing current exist in the
</p>
<p>contour comprising three elements: Lm, LgR, and RR. Therefore, the current decays
</p>
<p>exponentially with the time constant determined by the ratio of inductance and
</p>
<p>resistance of the circuit, tR &frac14; LR/RR. As a consequence, the envelope of the induced
electromotive force drops according to the law exp(-t/tR). Therefore, by determining
</p>
<p>the envelope of the line voltage, the rotor time constant can be estimated as the time
</p>
<p>required for the amplitude to drop e times, that is, to reduce to some 37% of the
</p>
<p>initial value.
</p>
<p>There is also possibility to calculate an approximate value of RR from data
</p>
<p>available on the nameplate of the machine. Parameter RR can be estimated from
</p>
<p>the equivalent circuit by using the rated voltages and currents. It is necessary to
</p>
<p>make a series of assumptions regarding the equivalent circuit in rated conditions.
</p>
<p>By neglecting the stator resistance and magnetizing inductance, the equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit reduces to series connection of the equivalent reactance Lgeoen and
</p>
<p>rotor resistance RR/s. In rated operating conditions, the voltage across the resistance
</p>
<p>RR/s of the equivalent circuit is equal to (Un
2 � (InLgeoen)2)1/2. If relative values
</p>
<p>are used, thenUn &frac14; 1 and In &frac14; 1. Reactance Lgeoen has relative value ranging from
0.05 to 0.25. The phasor of the voltage drop across this reactance is orthogonal to
</p>
<p>the phasor InRR/s; thus, the voltage drop InLgeoen has no significant impact on the
</p>
<p>voltage across the resistance RR/s. With Lgeosn &frac14; 0.25 and Un &frac14; 1, the relative
value of the rotor voltage InRR/s is 97%. Therefore, it is justifiable to assume that the
</p>
<p>rotor voltage in rated conditions is close to 1 relative unit. With rated current in both
</p>
<p>stator and rotor windings, impedance RR/sn is equal to Un/In &frac14; ZB. On the basis of
introduced approximations, it follows that RR � snZB. In other words, relative value
of rotor resistance rR &frac14; RR/ZB is close to the rated value of relative slip sn. Hence,
from nameplate of an induction motor that comprise data In &frac14; 22 A, Ufn &frac14; 220 V
(Uln &frac14; 380 V), fn &frac14; 50 Hz, and nn &frac14; 2,700 rpm, an estimate of the motor parame-
ter RR is snZB &frac14; 1 O.

<p>The torque can be determined by using expression Tem &frac14; (3/2) (s/RR)(p/oe)US2,

</p>
<p>Question (16.9): Considering the torque expression where the peak value of the
phase voltage US is replaced by the rms value of the same voltage, should the
</p>
<p>coefficient 3/2 be replaced as well? What is the rms value of the phase voltage if
</p>
<p>the machine is connected to a low-voltage network?
</p>
<p>Answer (16.9): Coefficient 3/2 should be replaced by 3. The rms value of the phase
voltage is 220 V.

<p>16.13 Operation with Slip
</p>
<p>Introductory considerations discussing principles of operation of induction
</p>
<p>machines demonstrated that, at relatively small values of relative slip, the torque
</p>
<p>is proportional to the slip (14.9, Question 14.1). With two-pole machine where
</p>
<p>p &frac14; 1, the angular speed of the rotating field Oe, also called synchronous speed, is
equal to the angular frequency of the supply voltages oe. If the slip is small, the
</p>
<p>rotor speed is close to the synchronous speed. In such case, impedance RR/s is the
</p>
<p>largest of all impedances in the denominator of the torque expression (16.27).

</p>
<p>This corresponds to equation (15.3) of the introductory section discussing the
</p>
<p>operating principles of induction machines. Therefore, with low slip, the torque
</p>
<p>Tem &frac14; 3poslipCS2/(2RR) is proportional to the slip, proportional to the square of the
stator flux, and inversely proportional to the rotor resistance. It can be concluded
</p>
<p>that the mechanical characteristic of induction motor is linear in the region of small
</p>
<p>slip frequencies and that the rate of change (slope) is proportional to the ratio
</p>
<p>CS
2/RR.
</p>
<p>16.14 Operation with Large Slip
</p>
<p>Abscissa of the mechanical characteristic shows the rotor speed om &frac14; Om. The
same axis can be used to show relative slip, which is equal to zero for Om &frac14; Oe. At
the origin of the mechanical characteristic, whereOm &frac14; 0, relative slip is equal to 1.
</p>
<p>In the region of high slips, prevailing part of the impedance in denominator of
</p>
<p>the torque expression is the equivalent leakage reactance Lgeoe, which depends on
</p>
<p>the supply frequency. At the rated supply frequency, reactance Xge &frac14; Lgeoen has
relative value ranging 10% up to 25%. With Om &frac14; 0 and s &frac14; 1, the stator current is
approximately equal to IST &frac14; Us/Xge. It is called start-up current, and it reaches 4In
to 10In. As the machine accelerates, the speed Om increases and the slip s reduces.
</p>
<p>The stator current remains high and almost constant until the slip s reduces enough
</p>
<p>to make the impedance RR/s prevail over Xge. Hence, for a wide range of slip values,
</p>
<p>the stator current is close to Us/Xge, and it does not depend on the rotor speed.

<p>The torque is proportional to the square of the current and to the resistance RR/s. For
</p>
<p>this reason, in the region with high slip, the torque is inversely proportional to
</p>
<p>relative slip. By reducing the speed of rotation, relative slip increases while the

<p>torque decreases following hyperbolic law:

<p>The torque developed at speed of Om &frac14; 0 with slip s &frac14; 1 is called the start-up
torque. By applying the usual approximations, the start-up torque is obtained as
</p>
<p>TST &frac14; (3p/2) (RR/oe) (US/Xge)2, where US denotes the peak value of the phase
voltage, while oe is the angular frequency of the stator voltages.
</p>
<p>16.15 Starting Mains Supplied Induction Machine
</p>
<p>When an induction motor at standstill gets connected to the three-phase mains with
</p>
<p>line voltages of 400 V and line frequency of fe &frac14; 50 Hz, the start-up current
ISTrms � USrms/Xge appears, exceeding by far the rated current. The start-up torque
TST &frac14; (3p/2) (RR/oe) (US/Xge)2 is developed, accelerating the rotor and increasing
the speed Om. As the speed reaches the synchronous speed Oe, the relative slip
</p>
<p>gradually decreases as well as the stator current. Reduction of relative slip increases
</p>
<p>RR/s and reduces the rotor and stator currents. In the absence of load torque TL, the
</p>
<p>acceleration ends with the speed reaching the synchronous speed, while the stator
</p>
<p>current reduces to no load current I0rms � USrms/Xm, which circulates through the
magnetizing branch of the equivalent circuit.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If the starting torque is not sufficient to prevail over the load torque and friction,
</p>
<p>and the rotor does not start to move, the stator current ISTrms � USrms/Xge � 5In is
maintained. In this regime, the losses are significantly larger than the losses at rated
</p>
<p>condition. The copper losses in the stator winding are some 25 times larger than the
</p>
<p>copper losses at rated conditions. Therefore, the rise of the machine temperature is
</p>
<p>very fast. If such a state is not discontinued quickly, the insulation and other vital
</p>
<p>parts get overheated and permanently damaged.
</p>
<p>16.16 Breakdown Torque and Breakdown Slip
</p>
<p>Mechanical characteristic of induction machine is linear in the region where
</p>
<p>the rotor speed is close to the synchronous speed and the relative slip is small.
</p>
<p>With the rotor speed close to zero, and with the relative slip close to 1, the torque is
</p>
<p>inversely proportional to the slip. Between the two zones, mechanical characteristic
</p>
<p>exhibits a maximum, which corresponds to the highest torque obtained with given
</p>
<p>stator supply. The maximum value of the torque is called breakdown torque. The
</p>
<p>breakdown torque Tb can be determined from the torque expression, by finding
</p>
<p>extremum of the function f(s) &frac14; Tem(s). The slip value sb which results in the
maximum torque is called breakdown slip. Assuming that the stator resistance RS
is negligible, the breakdown slip is determined from expression

<p>First derivative of function Tem(s) is equal to zero for s &frac14; +sb &frac14; +RR/Xge and for
s &frac14; �sb &frac14; �RR/Xge. At the speed of Om &frac14; Oe(1 � RR/Xge), there is the maximum
torque Tem &frac14; &thorn; Tb in motoring mode, where the torque is positive and the speed is
somewhat lower that the synchronous speed. For negative value of s, at the speed of
</p>
<p>Om &frac14; Oe(1 &thorn; RR/Xge), there is the torque extremum Tem &frac14; �Tb in generator mode,
when the torque is negative and the rotor speed is somewhat higher than the
</p>
<p>synchronous speed. In Fig. 16.12, the breakdown slip sb is somewhat higher than
</p>
<p>the value encountered with most standard induction machines.
</p>
<p>The breakdown frequency ob &frac14; oesb &frac14; RR/Lge does not depend on the supply
frequency, and it is equal to the quotient of the rotor resistance and the equivalent
</p>
<p>leakage inductance. By introducing the substitution s &frac14; sb &frac14; RR/Xge and approxi-
mation RS � 0 in the torque expression, it is possible to calculate the breakdown
torque. Breakdown torque in the generator mode has the same amplitude but the
</p>
<p>opposite sign:

<p>Therefore, the breakdown torque is proportional to the square of the stator flux
</p>
<p>and inversely proportional to the equivalent leakage inductance. For this reason, the
</p>
<p>breakdown torque is higher for induction machines having higher coupling coeffi-
</p>
<p>cient k between the stator and rotor windings. In the process of designing induction
</p>
<p>motors which are started by connection to the mains, the choice of the coupling
</p>
<p>coefficient and equivalent leakage inductance is the result of compromise. Namely,
</p>
<p>smaller values of Lge give higher breakdown torque, which is desirable, but also
</p>
<p>higher starting current ISTrms � USrms/Xge, which is not desirable.

<p>that the stator resistance RS is negligible. In addition, it is assumed that the mutual

<p>is relatively simple because it requires the knowledge of only two parameters: the
</p>
<p>breakdown torque and the breakdown slip.
</p>
<p>Question (16.10): Compare the breakdown torque in motor and generator modes.
</p>
<p>Answer (16.10): According to Kloss formula, and also the formula for electro-
magnetic torque Tem(s) where the influence of the stator resistance RS is neglected,
</p>
<p>the breakdown torque in motor mode is equal to the breakdown torque in generator
</p>
<p>mode. The difference between the two appears only in the case when RS is not
</p>
<p>negligible, and it can be determined by solving the equivalent circuit while taking
</p>
<p>into account the resistance RS, obtaining the corresponding expression for the
</p>
<p>torque Tem(s), and finding the extremum of the function Tem(s). The same conclu-
</p>
<p>sion can be reached considering the impact of the voltage drop RSIS on the flux
</p>
<p>16.17 Kloss Formula 465</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>amplitude. Starting from the expression for the breakdown torque Tb &frac14; (3p/4)CS2/
Lge, which shows that Tb depends on the square of the stator flux, it is possible to
</p>
<p>conclude that the breakdown torque in motoring mode has a lower absolute value
</p>
<p>than the breakdown torque in generator mode. The phasor of the stator flux can be
</p>
<p>determined on the basis of expressionCS &frac14; (US � RSIS). In motor mode, the active
component of the current is directed from the source to the machine; thus, the
</p>
<p>voltage drop RSIS makes the stator flux somewhat lower than US/oe. In generator
</p>
<p>mode, direction of the current is altered, thus increasing the flux above the value of
</p>
<p>US/oe. Therefore, the absolute value of the breakdown torque in generator mode is
</p>
<p>higher than that in motoring mode.
</p>
<p>The maximum torque of the mechanical characteristic Tem(s) is called break-
</p>
<p>down torque since the operation with TL &frac14; Tem &frac14; Tb at the rotor speed of Om &frac14;
Oe(1 � sb) is prone to transition to the zone Om &lt; Oe(1 � sb) where the slope of
the mechanical characteristic DT/Do changes sign. Transition to the zone where
</p>
<p>Om &lt; Oe(1 � sb) and s &gt; sb leads to a progressive reduction of the rotor speed and
eventually brings the rotor down to zero speed.
</p>
<p>16.18 Stable and Unstable Equilibrium
</p>
<p>If the torque of work machine TL is constant, the breakdown torque and breakdown
</p>
<p>slip separate the mechanical characteristic in two parts. The part where s &lt; sb
results in stable equilibrium Tem &frac14; TL, while the part with s &gt; sb results in unstable
equilibrium Tem &frac14; TL. The analysis starts from Newton equation of motion:
</p>
<p>J
dOm
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14; Tem&eth;Om&THORN; � TL: (16.38)
</p>
<p>Figure 16.13 shows the regions of stable and unstable equilibrium. The initial
</p>
<p>assumption is that the load torque is constant. Point UE represents an operating
</p>
<p>point in the region of unstable equilibrium. If the rotor speed drops by DOm, as
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.13 Regions of the
stable and unstable
</p>
<p>equilibrium
</p>
<p>466 16 Induction Machines at Steady State</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>shown in the figure, the operating point moves from right to left and arrives at the
</p>
<p>point denoted by UE1, where the load torque TL remains unchanged, while
</p>
<p>the electromagnetic torque Tem(Om) decreases. It is of interest to notice that the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque Tem reduces as the operating point moves to left from
</p>
<p>the point UE. The first derivative of the speed is JdOm/dt &frac14; Tem(Om) � TL, and it
becomes negative at UE1, thus leading to further decelerations. The operating point
</p>
<p>moves progressively to the left and goes toward the origin. Hence, once disturbed,
</p>
<p>the motor will not return to point UE.
</p>
<p>In the same figure, point SE is the operating point in the region of stable
</p>
<p>equilibrium. If the speed of rotation reduced due to an external disturbance, the
</p>
<p>operating point moves from right to left, the load torque TL remains unchanged,
</p>
<p>while the electromagnetic torque Tem(Om) increases. Derivative of the speed is
</p>
<p>positive; thus, the operating point returns to the equilibrium state, which is the
</p>
<p>point SE.
</p>
<p>The breakdown torque is the highest achievable torque. Starting from no load
</p>
<p>point with s &frac14; 0, where TL &frac14; 0 and Om &frac14; Oe, gradual increase of the load torque
results in gradual decrease of the rotor speed. At the same time, the relative slip and
</p>
<p>the electromagnetic torque are increased until the electromagnetic torque does not
</p>
<p>reach the load torque. When the value Tem reaches the load torque TL, the point SE
</p>
<p>of stable equilibrium is reached. When the load torque reaches the value of the
</p>
<p>breaking torque Tb, the electromagnetic torque Tem increases as well, and the
</p>
<p>operating point in Tem&ndash;Om diagram (Fig. 16.13) reaches the breakdown point (Tb,
</p>
<p>Ob). Any further load torque disturbance leads to crossing the breakdown point of
</p>
<p>Tem(Om) characteristic. The operating point passes toward the left and enters the
</p>
<p>region of unstable equilibrium. In turn, this leads to progressive reduction of the
</p>
<p>rotor speed. Assuming that the load torque does not change with the speed and
</p>
<p>remains constant, the rotor decelerates toward zero speed; it changes direction of
</p>
<p>rotation and proceeds accelerating in the opposite direction. With reactive load
</p>
<p>torque which resists the motion in both direction, the rotor would decelerate to zero
</p>
<p>and eventually stop.
</p>
<p>16.19 Region Suitable for Continuous Operation
</p>
<p>Permanent operation of an induction machine is possible in the operating regions
</p>
<p>where the stator current does not exceed the rated current. In the cases where
</p>
<p>IS &gt; In, losses in the machine exceed the permissible level. In a prolonged opera-
tion with increased losses, the temperature of the machine exceeds the safe limits
</p>
<p>and causes permanent damages of the vital parts. The region where continued
</p>
<p>operation is permitted is shown in Fig. 16.14.
</p>
<p>At no load, the slip is close to zero and the stator windings have no load current
</p>
<p>I0 &frac14; USn/(RS &thorn; joenLS) which is considerably lower than the rated current.
Described operating point corresponds to the crossing of the mechanical character-
</p>

<p>down the rotor, increases the slip, decreases impedance RR/s, and causes the stator
</p>
<p>and rotor currents to increase. At rated slip s &frac14; sn, induction machine develops the
rated torque Tn, it rotates at the rated speed On &frac14; Oen(1 � sn), and the stator
windings have rated current In.
</p>
<p>In the case when the load torque TL becomes negative, it tends to accelerate the
</p>
<p>rotor, increasing the rotor speed above synchronous speed. The slip becomes
</p>
<p>negative, as well as the impedance RR/s, resulting in negative air-gap power and
</p>
<p>negative torque. The machine operates in generator mode and converts mechanical
</p>
<p>energy to electrical energy. At the slip which is equal to the negative rated slip,
</p>
<p>s &frac14; �sn, induction machine develops the torque �Tn; it rotates at the rotor speed
Oen(1 &thorn; sn) which is higher than the synchronous speed, while the stator windings
have rated current (In).
</p>
<p>At rated supply conditions, stator current is maintained within the rated limits for
</p>
<p>slips jsj � sn, that is, for speeds Oen(1 � sn) � Om � Oen(1 &thorn; sn). For small
power induction machines, the speed may deviate from the synchronous speed by
</p>
<p>
10% maintaining at the same time the stator current within the rated limit. For
medium- and high-power machines, permissible deviation of the rotor speed is less
</p>
<p>than 1%. Continued operation of induction machines is possible with stator currents
</p>
<p>that remain within the rated limits, jISj � In. According to Fig. 16.14, condition
jISj � In is met for the rotor speeds that remain in close vicinity of the synchronous
speed. Therefore, in order to accomplish continuous variation of the rotor speed, it
</p>
<p>is necessary to change its synchronous speed. This is achieved by varying the

<p>frequency of the stator voltages and currents, which is achieved by supplying the
</p>
<p>induction machine from a three-phase source providing variable frequency AC
</p>
<p>voltages.
</p>
<p>16.20 Losses and Power Balance
</p>
<p>One of the assumptions taken in modeling of electrical machines has been
</p>
<p>neglecting the losses in magnetic circuit, also called iron losses. These losses
</p>
<p>have one part proportional to B2f 2, caused by eddy currents, and the other part
</p>
<p>proportional to B2f, caused by hysteresis of the B(H) curve. The power balance
</p>
<p>discussed hereafter takes into account the iron losses as well.
</p>
<p>Within the rotor of an induction machine, there are variations of the magnetic
</p>
<p>induction at relatively low-slip frequency. Thus, the power of losses within the rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit is relatively small. Power of iron losses in the stator magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit is considerably higher since the magnetic field in the stator core varies at the
</p>
<p>frequency of the supply voltages oe. Besides iron losses and copper losses, the
</p>
<p>process of electromechanical conversion has the losses in mechanical subsystem.
</p>
<p>Mechanical losses include the motion resistances such as the air resistance and
</p>
<p>friction in bearings.
</p>
<p>16.21 Copper, Iron, and Mechanical Losses
</p>
<p>The most significant losses in an induction machine are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Copper losses in stator windings, RSIS
2
</p>
<p>&bull; Losses in rotor cage winding, RRIR
2
</p>
<p>&bull; Iron losses in stator magnetic circuit, sH fe Bm
2 &thorn; sV fe2 Bm2
</p>
<p>&bull; Iron losses in rotor magnetic circuit, sH fk Bm
2 &thorn; sV fk2 Bm2
</p>
<p>&bull; Mechanical losses due to rotation, kFOm
2
</p>
<p>Losses in copper of the stator winding are proportional to the square of the rms
</p>
<p>value of the stator current, Pcu1 &frac14; 3RS ISrms2.
The losses PFe1 in stator magnetic circuit are proportional to square of the
</p>
<p>magnetic induction, and they are dependent on stator frequency fe. If the eddy
</p>
<p>current losses prevail, the iron losses are proportional to the square of the stator
</p>
<p>frequency.
</p>
<p>Currents in rotor bars create losses which are proportional to the square of the
</p>
<p>rotor current, PCu2 &frac14; 3RRIRrms2. In addition to losses in the rotor winding, there are
also iron losses in the rotor magnetic circuit, where the magnetic field varies at the
</p>
<p>slip frequency oslip. The slip frequency oslip is much lower than the stator fre-
</p>
<p>quency. Therefore, the rotor iron losses are often neglected. Yet, there are operating
</p>
<p>modes where the rotor iron losses are considerable and cannot be neglected. One of
</p>
<p>16.21 Copper, Iron, and Mechanical Losses 469</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>them is the start-up mode, when the machine with the rotor at standstill gets
</p>
<p>connected to the mains and has the slip frequency of oslip &frac14; oe, contributing to
significant iron losses in the rotor magnetic circuit.
</p>
<p>Losses due to rotation are caused by friction in bearings, air resistance, and other
</p>
<p>phenomena in mechanical subsystem of the induction machine which oppose to the
</p>
<p>rotor motion. The torque due to the air resistance is proportional to the square of the
</p>
<p>rotor speed, while the corresponding power depends on the third power of the rotor
</p>
<p>speed. On the other hand, the sum of all the losses due to rotation is often modeled
</p>
<p>by an approximate formula PF � kFOm2, with the corresponding torque being
TF &frac14; kFOm. The friction torque TF is subtracted from the electromagnetic torque
Tem which is generated by electromagnetic forces. Thus, the torque available at the
</p>
<p>output shaft becomes Tm &frac14; Tem � TF, and it is somewhat lower than Tem.
</p>
<p>16.22 Internal Mechanical Power
</p>
<p>Electrical source connected to the stator windings supplies the input power Pe to
</p>
<p>the induction machine. At steady state, the input electrical power can be deter-
</p>
<p>mined on the basis of expression Pe &frac14; 3USrms ISrms cos(&rsquo;), where USrms is the rms
value of the phase voltages and ISrms is the rms value of the stator currents, while
</p>
<p>cos(&rsquo;) is the power factor. The power of losses Pcu1 &frac14; 3RSISrms2 represents the
copper losses in the stator windings, and it depends on the squared rms value of
</p>
<p>the stator currents. The losses in the stator magnetic circuit, also called the stator
</p>
<p>iron losses, are denoted by PFe1, and they depend on the stator frequency
</p>
<p>oe and the magnetic induction B. Considering that the stator flux depends on
</p>
<p>the magnetic induction in the stator iron, the stator iron losses can be expressed
</p>
<p>in terms of the squared amplitude of the stator flux. The air-gap power Pd &frac14; Pe
� Pcu1 � PFe1 is transferred from the stator to the rotor, and it passes through the
air gap. Electromagnetic torque Tem &frac14; Pd/Oe is obtained by dividing the air-gap
power by the speed of rotation Oe of the magnetic field, also called synchronous
</p>
<p>speed:
</p>
<p>Pd &frac14; Pe � 3RSi2Srms � PFe1 &frac14; TemOe: (16.39)
</p>
<p>The product of the electromagnetic torque Tem &frac14; Pd/Oe and the rotor speed Om
results in the internal mechanical power PmR. This power is slightly lower than the
</p>
<p>air-gap power, as the rotor does not revolve at the synchronous speed. The differ-
</p>
<p>ence between the air-gap power and the internal mechanical power covers the rotor
</p>
<p>losses, namely, the copper losses in the rotor and relatively small iron losses in the

<p>rotor:

</p>
<p>The rotor speed is lower than the synchronous speed by the amount of slip.
</p>
<p>Mechanical powerPmR created inside themachine is equal toPmR &frac14; TemOm. At steady
state,mechanical powerPmR is equal toTemOm &frac14; TemOe(1 � s) &frac14; (1 � s)Pd. There-
fore, the balance sPd is equal to the power of losses in the rotor, and these are the losses
</p>
<p>in the rotor windings Pcu2 and the losses in the rotor magnetic circuit PFe2. Since rotor
</p>
<p>frequency is relatively small, it is most often justified to assume that PFe2 � 0 and use
the expression sPd &frac14; PCu2.
</p>
<p>Useful mechanical power Pm &frac14; TmOm is different from internal mechanical
power PmR &frac14; TemOm by the amount of losses due to rotation. These are the losses
in mechanical subsystem, including the air resistance and friction in bearings.

<p>The equivalent circuit of induction machine shown in Fig. 16.16 is modified in

<p>to US � RSIS, and it is determined by product joeCS, which allows calculation of
the stator flux CS by finding US

<p>1/joe. In the case when variables jUSj, jISj, and jIRj
represent the rms values of voltages and currents, then the peak value of fluxC, that
</p>
<p>is, the amplitude of the flux vector is determined by calculating 20.5jCj. Voltage
Um &frac14; US1 � joeLgSIS is equal to joeCm, which allows calculation of magnetizing
flux Cm by calculating Um/joe. Voltage UR &frac14; Um &thorn; joeLgRIR is equal to joeCR,
which allows calculation of rotor flux CR by calculating UR/joe.

<p>16.24 Balance of Power
</p>
<p>Balance of power of an induction machine operating as a motor is presented in

</p>
<p>Pe &gt; Pd &gt; PmR &gt; Pm. Coefficient of efficiency in motor operating mode is � &frac14;
Pm/Pe.
</p>
<p>Useful mechanical power obtained at the output shaft is
</p>
<p>Pm &frac14; PmR � kFO2m: (16.42)
</p>
<p>If the stator copper losses, the stator iron losses, and the losses due to rotation are
</p>
<p>neglected, only the rotor winding losses are taken into account. The electrical
</p>
<p>power taken from the source, that is, from the mains is
</p>
<p>Pe � Pd � PCu2 &thorn; Pm &frac14; sPd &thorn; 1� s&eth; &THORN;Pd: (16.43)
</p>
<p>In generator mode, the machine receives mechanical power from the shaft.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the output power Pm &frac14; TmOm is negative, considering adopted reference
directions. In the above figure, it is assumed that positive power depicts the energy
</p>
<p>transfer from left to right. Indicated power amounts Pe, Pd, PmR, and Pm are
</p>
<p>negative in generator mode, and they are related by Pe &gt; Pd &gt; PmR &gt; Pm, that
is, jPej &lt; jPdj &lt; jPmRj &lt; jPmj.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Considering generator mode and adopting the reference power flow from right to
</p>
<p>left, negative values are omitted and the balance of power of the machine is more
</p>
<p>obvious. A generator is, via shaft, supplied by the input mechanical power Pm. By
</p>
<p>subtracting the losses of the mechanical subsystem, which are the losses due to
</p>
<p>rotation, one obtains the internal mechanical power which is converted to electrical
</p>
<p>power. The losses in the rotor windings and magnetic circuit are subtracted from the
</p>
<p>obtained electrical power (-PmR &gt; 0) to obtain the air-gap power (�Pob &gt; 0)
which is transferred to the stator. After subtracting the losses in stator copper
</p>
<p>and iron, one obtains the electrical power (�Pe &gt; 0) provided by the generator,
which can be transferred to consumers via three-phase network connected to the
</p>
<p>stator windings of the induction generator. Coefficient of efficiency in generator
</p>
<p>mode is equal to � &frac14; Pe/Pm. Induction generators are often used in small hydro-
electric power plant stations and wind power plants. When connected to the mains,
</p>
<p>induction generators have magnetic field that rotates at the synchronous speed of
</p>
<p>Oe &frac14; 2p ∙50/p. Mechanical power obtained from the water flow or from the wind
accelerates the rotor and makes it revolve at speeds which are higher than the
</p>
<p>synchronous speed. In this regime, relative slip is negative, as well as the equivalent
</p>
<p>resistance RR/s of the equivalent circuit. For this reason, electrical power absorbed
</p>
<p>by the machine from the network is negative, meaning that the machine actually
</p>
<p>supplies the network with electrical energy. This energy is obtained by converting
</p>
<p>the mechanical work into electrical energy.

<p>Variable Speed Induction Machines
</p>
<p>This chapter discusses the means for the speed change of induction machines.
</p>
<p>The speed regulation is required in both generators and motors. Induction machines
</p>
<p>that serve as generators in wind power stations revolve at variable speed. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the machine and the associated equipment must ensure conversion of mechanical
</p>
<p>work in electrical energy at variable speed. The machines used as motors often serve
</p>
<p>in motion control applications, where the speed changes in continuous manner.
</p>
<p>In the first part of this chapter, the means for altering the rotor speed of mains-
</p>
<p>supplied induction machines are discussed and explained. Possibilities are consid-
</p>
<p>ered to adjust the rotor speed of induction machines operating with constant
</p>
<p>frequency of stator voltages. The analysis considers changes in mechanical charac-
</p>
<p>teristic and the rotor speed due to variations of the voltage amplitude. Variation of
</p>
<p>the rotor resistance is studied as the means of changing the rotor speed of wound
</p>
<p>rotor induction machines. The impact of the number of magnetic pole pairs p on
</p>
<p>synchronous speed Oe and rotor speed Om is reinstated, and the change of the
</p>
<p>number of poles is looked upon as the means of changing the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>An introduction to electrical machines with multiple pole pairs is given by studying
</p>
<p>distribution of the magnetic field of an electrical machine with 2p &frac14; 4 magnetic
poles. The possibility of designing the stator winding so as to achieve the magnetic
</p>
<p>field with multiple pole pairs is studied on a sample winding that can be switched to
</p>
<p>produce either 2p &frac14; 2 poles or 2p &frac14; 4 poles. The expressions for synchronous
speed, rotor speed, and slip frequency are given as functions of the number of
</p>
<p>magnetic pole pairs. Discussion on constant frequency-supplied induction machine
</p>
<p>closes with establishing deficiencies, limitations, energy losses, and design
</p>
<p>problems arising in mains-supplied induction machines.
</p>
<p>The second part of this chapter deals with induction machines supplied from
</p>
<p>variable frequency sources such as the three-phase inverters with switching power
</p>
<p>transistors and pulse width modulation control. This chapter introduces basic
</p>
<p>aspects and problems of variable frequency supply. Operation of induction
</p>
<p>machines fed from variable frequency static power converter is introduced and
</p>
<p>studied. A short review of power converter topologies used for supplying induction

<p>voltage amplitude and frequency, suited to accomplish desired rotor speed and

<p>region. The basic approaches the torque, flux, and power control are outlined for an
</p>
<p>induction machine fed from a variable frequency static power converter. Family of
</p>

</p>
<p>explained. Based upon the study of operating limits of the machine and operating
</p>
<p>limits of associated three-phase inverter, steady state operating area and transient
</p>
<p>operating area are derived in T-O plane and studied for variable frequency operation
</p>
<p>of induction machines. The limits of constant power operation in field weakening
</p>
<p>mode are determined, explained, and expressed in terms of the machine leakage
</p>
<p>inductance. Finally, this chapter discusses the differences in construction and
</p>
<p>parameters of mains-supplied induction machines and inverter-supplied induction
</p>
<p>machines.
</p>
<p>17.1 Speed Changes in Mains-Supplied Machines
</p>
<p>In majority of applications of electrical machines, it is required to accomplish a
</p>
<p>continuous variation of the rotor speed. Some of examples are motion control tasks
</p>
<p>in production machines and industrial robots and propulsion tasks in electrical
</p>
<p>vehicles, fans, pumps, and similar.
</p>
<p>The rotor speed of induction machines is different from the synchronous speed
</p>
<p>by the amount of the slip. When an induction motor is supplied from the mains, the
</p>
<p>stator current is maintained within rated limits under condition that the slip remains
</p>
<p>relatively low, jsj � sn, namely, for the speed range Oen(1� sn) � Om � Oen(1 &thorn;
sn). Hence, continuous operation of mains-supplied induction machine is restricted
</p>
<p>to a rather narrow range of speeds. For medium- and high-power machines, the
</p>
<p>rated slip is lower than 1%; thus, the condition IS � In is maintained within the
range of speeds from 99% up to 101% of the synchronous speed. Operation at
</p>
<p>higher slip frequencies involves high losses and high currents in stator and rotor
</p>
<p>windings. The use of induction machine outside the zone where jsj � sn and IS � In
leads to an increase of the machine temperature. For this reason, continued service
</p>
<p>of induction machines is possible only with relatively small values of slip. There-
</p>
<p>fore, it is justified to conclude that the speed of rotation Om is close to the
</p>
<p>synchronous speed Oe. Synchronous speed Oe &frac14; oe/p is determined by the angular
frequency of the stator voltages oe, that is, by the frequency of electrical currents in
</p>
<p>stator windings. For two-pole machines, where the number of pole pairs p is equal
</p>
<p>to 1, the synchronous speed is equal to the angular frequency of the supply. For this
</p>
<p>reason, variation of the rotor speed of an induction machine requires a variable
</p>
<p>frequency of the stator voltages and currents. This can be accomplished by supply-
</p>
<p>ing the machine from a three-phase source of AC voltages having variable
</p>
<p>frequency. Most common solution to this is the three-phase inverter, a power
</p>
<p>converter which employs semiconductor power switches. Inverters are mostly
</p>
<p>476 17 Variable Speed Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>used in conjunction with three-phase diode rectifiers. Three-phase diode rectifiers
</p>
<p>are power converters supplied from the mains with line voltages of 400 V and line
</p>
<p>frequency of f &frac14; 50 or 60 Hz. The rectifier converts the AC line voltages into DC
voltage. This DC voltage is fed to the three-phase inverter, which converts the
</p>
<p>DC voltage into a set of three-phase AC voltage of variable frequency and variable
</p>
<p>amplitude. Finally, at the output terminals of the inverter, a three-phase system is
</p>
<p>available with frequency and voltage amplitude that can be changed to suit the
</p>
<p>needs of the induction machine. Contemporary inverters apply pulse width modu-
</p>
<p>lation control and make use of semiconductor switches such as bipolar transistors
</p>
<p>(BJT), MOSFET transistors, and IGBT transistors. Industrial use of such devices
</p>
<p>started in last decades of the twentieth century. At present, power converters using
</p>
<p>power transistors are standard industrial units for supplying induction machines and
</p>
<p>changing their speed (Fig. 17.10a).
</p>
<p>Induction machines have been in use for more than 100 years. During the first
</p>
<p>century of industrial use of induction machines, there were no semiconductor
</p>
<p>switches suitable for designing the three-phase inverters. Therefore, another kind
</p>
<p>of components, devices, and techniques was being devised and used to achieve
</p>
<p>continuous variation of the rotor speed of induction machines. Induction machines
</p>
<p>were supplied from the mains providing the voltages of industrial frequency,
</p>
<p>whether fe &frac14; 50 Hz or fe &frac14; 60 Hz. There were no ways of altering the supply
frequency and providing continuous change of the synchronous speed. Therefore,
</p>
<p>most induction machines were primarily used in constant speed applications.
</p>
<p>Particular procedures, methods, and devices were used in applications requiring
</p>
<p>variable speed operation, all of them conditioned and restricted by technology
</p>
<p>limits of the times. Traditional approaches to speed variations include:
</p>
<p>1. Variation of stator voltage
</p>
<p>2. Variation of rotor resistance
</p>
<p>3. Variation of the number of poles
</p>
<p>Besides, in some cases, induction motors were connected to mechanical load by
</p>
<p>means of transmission mechanism with gears or some other mechanical
</p>
<p>transducers. Using particularly suited transmission with variable transmission
</p>
<p>ratio, it was possible to change the load speed while the induction motor speed
</p>
<p>remained constant, close to the synchronous speed.
</p>
<p>In further text, the effects of the traditional approaches (1), (2), and (3) will be
</p>
<p>reviewed.
</p>
<p>17.2 Voltage Change
</p>
<p>With constant frequency supply, mechanical characteristic of an induction machine
</p>
<p>crosses the abscissa Om of Tem�Om plane at Om &frac14; Oe &frac14;2pfe/p, where Tem &frac14; 0
(Fig. 17.1). Upon loading, the slip increases and the speed decreases. In generator
</p>
<p>mode, where Tem &lt; 0 and oslip &lt; 0, the torque amplitude jTemj increases as the
</p>
<p>17.2 Voltage Change 477</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>rotor speed goes beyond Oe. The electromagnetic torque is proportional to the slip
</p>
<p>and also proportional to the square of the stator flux CS. In turn, the flux amplitude
</p>
<p>CS is proportional to the quotient of the stator voltage and the angular frequency,
</p>
<p>CS � US/oe.
Reduction of the stator voltage results in reduction of the flux. At the same time,
</p>
<p>the slope of the mechanical characteristic S &frac14; DT/Do is reduced as well. As a
consequence, the speed would exhibit larger reduction for the same torque. In the
</p>
<p>region of small slip, the electromagnetic torque varies according to the law
</p>
<p>Tem &frac14; koslipCS2/RR. Therefore, reduction of the flux CS causes an increase in the
slip speed oslip and reduction of the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>Speed can be changed by the voltage variations in a limited range. Namely,
</p>
<p>the speed can be varied within the range that does not exceed the breakdown slip sb.
</p>
<p>A consequence of the speed reduction by the slip increase is an increase of the rotor
</p>
<p>losses PCu2 � sPd, which may lead to increase of the machine temperature.
Variation of the rotor speed of an induction machine obtained by changing the
</p>
<p>amplitude of the supply voltage is seldom used. One possible use of the voltage
</p>
<p>control is in fan drives, where mechanical power is proportional to the third power
</p>
<p>of the rotor speed. It takes a relatively small change of the rotor speed to produce
</p>
<p>significant change of the torque and power. Hence, the speed regulation based on
</p>
<p>reduction of the stator voltage does not produce significant losses PCu2 � sPd since
the air-gap power Pd ~ Om
</p>
<p>3 reduces considerably even with relatively small drop in
</p>
<p>the rotor speed. For small fan drives with induction motors, voltage can be reduced
</p>
<p>by inserting variable resistors in series with the stator winding. The series connec-
</p>
<p>tion of the stator windings and variable resistors is fed from the mains with constant
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>voltages. An increase in series resistance reduces the voltage across the stator
</p>
<p>windings, increases the slip, and reduces the rotor speed. Disadvantage of this
</p>
<p>approach is the presence of Joule losses in series resistors.
</p>
<p>17.3 Wound Rotor Machines
</p>
<p>Most induction machines have the rotor winding made of cast aluminum, having
</p>
<p>the form of a cage with two short-circuiting rings. On the other hand, the rotor
</p>
<p>winding can be made in the same way as the stator winding by placing insulated
</p>
<p>copper conductors in the rotor slots and connecting these conductors in series, so as
</p>
<p>to make a star-connected three-phase winding. The three end terminals of such
</p>
<p>winding can be made available from the stator side. In most cases, the ends of the
</p>
<p>rotor winding are connected to three conductive rings that are fastened to the shaft
</p>
<p>and mutually isolated. These rings rotate with the shaft, but they are electrically
</p>
<p>isolated from the shaft too. From the stator side, there are three conductive brushes
</p>
<p>fastened to the stator and pressed against revolving rings. They touch the external
</p>
<p>surface of the rings and provide electrical contacts. The brushes slide along the
</p>
<p>circumference of the rings, which are also called slip rings. Induction machine with
</p>
<p>slip rings is also called wound rotor machine. The three brushes make the rotor
</p>
<p>winding ends available for stator side connections. A variable three-phase resistor
</p>
<p>can be connected to the brushes, providing the means for changing the equivalent
</p>
<p>resistance of the rotor circuit. The effects of inserting an external resistor into the
</p>
<p>rotor circuit are the same as the effects of hypothetical changes of the rotor
</p>
<p>resistance of the rotor with short-circuited cage. Variation of an externally
</p>
<p>connected three-phase resistor changes mechanical characteristic of the machine
</p>
<p>in the way shown in Fig. 17.2. Sample wound rotor machine is given in Fig. 17.3.
</p>
<p>When the brushes are brought into short circuit, the wound rotor is short-
</p>
<p>circuited. In such case, behavior of the machine and its mechanical characteristic
</p>
<p>are the same as with a squirrel cage induction machine. By way of slip rings and
</p>
<p>brushes, additional resistance Rext can be inserted in the rotor circuit, increasing in
</p>
<p>this way the value of equivalent rotor resistance RRe &frac14; RR &thorn; Rext which should
substitute RR in the steady state equivalent circuit.
</p>
<p>Considering the expression for the breakdown torque, it is concluded that
</p>
<p>Tb ~ CS
2/Lge. Hence, an increase in the rotor resistance RRe does not affect the
</p>
<p>value of the breakdown torque. On the other hand, the slope DT/Do of the
</p>
<p>mechanical characteristic is inversely proportional to the rotor resistance,
</p>
<p>Tem ~ koslipCS
2/RRe; thus, increasing the total rotor resistance RRe decreases the
</p>
<p>slope of the mechanical characteristic jDT/Doj. Breakdown slip sb &frac14; RRe/Xge is
proportional to the rotor resistance; thus, increasing the external resistor Rext
increases the breakdown slip in both motor and generator modes. Total effects of
</p>
<p>variation of the rotor resistance on mechanical characteristic are shown in Fig. 17.2.
</p>
<p>While breakdown torque remains unchanged, breakdown slip increases, while
</p>
<p>slope of the mechanical characteristic gradually decreases.
</p>
<p>17.3 Wound Rotor Machines 479</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The effects of the rotor resistance changes on the rotor speed are investigated by
</p>
<p>assuming that the load torque is constant as well as the supply frequency and the
</p>
<p>synchronous speed. In Fig. 17.2, the load characteristic becomes a horizontal line.
</p>
<p>The operating speed is obtained at the crossing of the load characteristic and the
</p>
<p>mechanical characteristic. It is observed in the figure that the intersection of the two
</p>
<p>characteristics occurs at lower speeds if the equivalent rotor resistance is larger.
</p>
<p>Hence, the rotor speed can be changed by changing the external resistor connected
</p>
<p>in the rotor circuit via slip rings and brushes. Continuous variation of the resistance
</p>
<p>enables continuous variation of the rotor speed. Unlike squirrel cage motors, wound
</p>
<p>rotor motors can operate with very large slips. When operating with slips in excess
</p>
<p>to the rated slip, the stator and rotor currents of the squirrel cage motors exceed the
</p>
<p>rated currents and result in overheating. An induction motor with wound rotor may
</p>
<p>operate with higher slip values. With elevated slip, resistance RRe/s of the rotor
</p>
<p>branch in the equivalent circuit is reduced, but the equivalent resistance RRe &frac14; RR
&thorn; Rext is increased due to external resistance, keeping the stator and rotor currents
within acceptable limits.
</p>
<p>A shortcoming of the described approach is poor efficiency caused by additional
</p>
<p>losses in the external resistor. The speed Om &frac14; Oe(1�s) is controlled in the way
which keeps synchronous speed Oe constant. The rotor speed Om is lowered on
</p>
<p>account of an increased slip s. With an increase in slip, the rotor losses sPd &frac14; PCu2
are increased as well. Increased losses PCu2 do not cause overheating of the
</p>
<p>induction machine, because significant part of these losses is dissipated in the
</p>
<p>external three-phase resistor. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the system is signifi-
</p>
<p>cantly reduced. Mains-supplied two-pole induction motor has the synchronous
</p>
<p>speed of ne &frac14; 3,000 rpm. In cases when the rotor speed is reduced to 1,500 rpm,

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>one half of the air-gap power is dissipated in the rotor circuit, while the other half is
</p>
<p>converted into mechanical power. The efficiency of this induction motor is
</p>
<p>lower than 50%. Poor efficiency is the consequence of a high value of sPd, also
</p>
<p>called slip power.
</p>
<p>Efficiency of an induction machine with wound rotor and external resistor is
</p>
<p>poor due to large slip power sPd which is converted into heat. Efficiency can be
</p>
<p>increased by recovering the slip power back to the mains. In the middle of the
</p>
<p>twentieth century, semiconductor diodes and thyristors suitable for industrial
</p>
<p>applications have been developed and put to use. Static power converters have
</p>
<p>been designed comprising diodes and thyristors. Connecting a static power con-
</p>
<p>verter to the rotor circuit, the slip power sPd is transferred to the diode rectifier,
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 17.4, which converts AC rotor currents to DC currents in the choke
</p>

</p>
<p>Development of power transistor suitable for building high-power inverters
</p>
<p>culminated in the last quarter of the twentieth century. It provided the means for
</p>
<p>supplying the induction machines with three-phase voltages of variable frequency.
</p>
<p>This allowed continuous change of synchronous speed as a viable way of
</p>
<p>controlling the rotor speed. Therefore, the need for wound rotor induction machines
</p>
<p>and cascade static power converters gradually declined.

<p>1 Slip rings&rsquo; access to the rotor winding can be used to take the slip power out of the rotor circuit, as
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 17.4. It is also possible to use the static power converter of different topology and to
</p>
<p>use it to supply the power to the rotor circuit. In this case, slip power and slip speed are negative,
</p>
<p>and the rotor revolves at the speed Om &gt; Oe. The two considered topologies are called
subsynchronous cascade and supersynchronous cascade. Over the past century, there were also
</p>
<p>applications of wound rotor induction machines with slip rings and a four-quadrant (reversible)
</p>
<p>static power converter in the rotor circuit. With four-quadrant rotor converter, wound rotor
</p>
<p>machine can operate with Om &gt; Oe as well as with Oe &gt; Om. Some early wind power solutions
were conceived with wound rotor induction generators and static power converter in the rotor
</p>
<p>circuit. The advantage of this approach is relatively low slip power which results in relatively low
</p>
<p>voltage and current ratings of semiconductor power switches. More recent wind power generators

<p>17.4 Changing Pole Pairs
</p>
<p>The rotor speed of a squirrel cage induction machine is close to the synchronous
</p>
<p>speed Oe &frac14; oe/p, where oe is the angular frequency of the power supply, while 2p
is the number of magnetic poles of the machine. The mains-supplied machines
</p>
<p>operate with constant stator frequency, and their synchronous speed cannot be
</p>
<p>varied.2 There is, however, a possibility to vary the number of poles 2p. For a
</p>
<p>two-pole machine with p &frac14; 1 and with f &frac14; 50 Hz, the synchronous speed is
ne &frac14; 3,000 rpm. By increasing the number of poles to 2p &frac14; 4, 6, or 8, one obtains
synchronous speeds of 1,500, 1,000, and 750 rpm, respectively. Hence, the syn-
</p>
<p>chronous speed as well as the rotor speed can be changed in discrete steps by
</p>
<p>altering the number of magnetic poles.
</p>
<p>It is of interest to discuss the number of magnetic poles in AC and DC machines.
</p>
<p>In DC machines, magnetic field is created by permanent magnets or by the excita-
</p>
<p>tion winding. The number of magnetic poles is determined by design of the
</p>
<p>machine, and it is equal to the number of main stator poles. For that reason, it
</p>
<p>cannot be changed during the operation. The number of magnetic poles in DC
</p>
<p>machines affects design and the construction of mechanical commutator, machine
</p>
<p>windings, and the form of magnetic circuits. For that reason, it is not possible to
</p>
<p>change the number of magnetic poles unless the whole construction of the machine
</p>
<p>is changed. In AC machines, magnetic field is created by electrical current in the
</p>
<p>stator windings. With suitable design of the stator windings, appropriate reconnec-
</p>
<p>tion of the stator phases can be used to change the number of magnetic poles.
</p>
<p>Hence, the synchronous speed of an induction motor as well as the rotor speed can
</p>
<p>be changed by altering the electrical connections of the stator phases.
</p>
<p>In many applications of electric drives, it is not required to accomplish a
</p>
<p>continuous variation of the rotor speed. Instead, it is sufficient to have two or
</p>
<p>three discrete values of the speed which can be selected as required. Then, the
</p>
<p>problem of regulation of the rotor speed can be solved by using an induction
</p>
<p>machine fed from a constant frequency source, under conditions that the number
</p>
<p>of poles can be varied. In the case of an induction machine, magnetic poles of the
</p>
<p>rotating field are not related to any particular part of the magnetic circuit. Instead,
</p>
<p>they rotate with respect to the stator and rotor magnetic circuits. The number of
</p>
<p>poles is dependent on distribution of electrical current in the stator slots. This
</p>
<p>distribution depends on the supply currents and on the method used to make the
</p>
<p>stator winding. So far, induction machines have been considered with two-pole
</p>
<p>magnetic field which has diametrically positioned north and south magnetic poles,
</p>
<p>as shown in the upper part of Fig. 17.5. The same figure also shows distribution of
</p>
<p>the stator currents which create magnetic field with two north and two south poles.
</p>
<p>In the lower part of Fig. 17.5, electrical currents in diametrically positioned
</p>
<p>conductors have the same direction. In one pair of diametrically placed conductors,
</p>
<p>2When the machine is supplied from an inverter with power transistors, the frequency of the
</p>
<p>supply can be varied. Consequently, the rotor speed can be varied too.

<p>direction is
J
</p>
<p>. The other pair of diametrically positioned conductors is displaced
</p>
<p>by p/2 with respect to the first pair, and it has electrical currents of the opposite
</p>
<p>direction
N
</p>
<p>. The magnetomotive force created by the system of four conductors
</p>
<p>comprises two zones where the lines of magnetic field pass from rotor to stator and
</p>
<p>two zones where the lines of magnetic field pass from stator to rotor. Therefore,
</p>
<p>stator currents in this example create magnetic field having two north poles and two
</p>
<p>south poles. This field is called a four-pole field. Magnetic field under consideration
</p>
<p>has four magnetic poles or two-pole pairs; hence, p &frac14; 2.
Example given in Fig. 17.5 shows that the three-phase windings with appropriate
</p>
<p>distribution of conductors can create a four-pole rotating magnetic field. On the
</p>
<p>left-hand side in Fig. 17.6, there is a three-phase stator winding with spatial
</p>
<p>displacement of 2p/3 between the phases, which creates a two-pole magnetic

<p>field in the air gap. A stator winding which creates a two-pole field is often called
</p>
<p>two-pole winding. The right-hand side of the same figure shows the method of
</p>
<p>forming a three-phase stator winding with magnetomotive force that creates a four-
</p>
<p>pole magnetic field in the air gap. Each of the phases a, b, and c is split into two
</p>
<p>sections, each with the same number of turns. The sections of the phase windings
</p>
<p>are spatially displaced by p, while the angle between the neighboring sections is
</p>
<p>p/3, which is one half of the spatial shift of a two-pole winding.
</p>
<p>Phase a of the four-pole stator winding consists of two diametrically positioned
</p>
<p>sections. The sections are connected in series; thus, the conductors of both sections
</p>
<p>carry the same current ia(t). The reference terminals of each of the sections are
</p>
<p>marked by dots. Convention of marking the reference terminal is the following:
</p>
<p>when the current enters the dot-marked terminal of the considered section, then the
</p>
<p>section creates the magnetomotive force and field which start from the rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit and propagate through the air gap toward the considered section.
</p>
<p>In the case when the two sections, actually the two halves a1 and a2 of the phase
</p>
<p>winding a, are connected in series and in such way that the phase current ia(t)
</p>
<p>enters the dot-marked terminals of both halves, magnetic field is created with two
</p>
<p>north and two south poles. Namely, at positions y &frac14; 0 and y &frac14; p, it creates the
field with lines that pass from the rotor to the stator. Due to flux conservation law
</p>
<p>(div B &frac14; 0), corresponding field lines must pass from the stator to the rotor at
positions y &frac14; p/2 and y &frac14; 3p/2. In this way, a four-pole field is created, the field
with two pairs of poles (p &frac14; 2), having two north magnetic poles and two south
magnetic poles. With phase currents ia(t), ib(t), and ic(t) that have sinusoidal
</p>
<p>change of the same amplitude and frequency, and which are phase shifted by
</p>
<p>2p/3, consequential magnetic field revolves at the speed determined by the supply
</p>
<p>frequency, and it does not change the amplitude. It can be shown that the speed of
</p>
<p>rotation Oe of the four-pole field is equal to one half of the supply frequency oe.
</p>
<p>From Fig. 17.6, it should be noted that one of the magnetic poles is against the
</p>
<p>section a1 at t &frac14; 0, when the phase current ia(t) &frac14; Im cos oet has the value
ia(t) &frac14; +Im. Corresponding magnetic pole is marked by an arrow ! which is
directed toward the section a1. The phase current ib(t) &frac14; Im cos(oet�2p/3) is
delayed, and it reached its maximum positive value at t1 &frac14; 2p/(3oe). Over the
interval 0 &lt; t &lt; t1, the considered magnetic pole is shifting from the section a1
toward the section b1, where it arrives at the instant t1. At t2 &frac14; 4p/(3oe), the phase
current ic(t) reaches its maximum value. Then the considered magnetic pole is
</p>
<p>placed against the section c1. At the end of one full period, at t3 &frac14; 2p/oe, the
maximum of ia(t) &frac14; +Im is repeated in the phase current ia(t). At the same time,
the magnetic pole being tracked reaches position against the section a2. During one
</p>
<p>period of voltages and currents (electrical period) T &frac14; 2p/oe, the phase change of
electrical currents is Dye &frac14; 2p, while the spatial displacement of the magnetic pole
is Dym &frac14; p. Therefore, the speed of rotation of the field is one half of the supply
frequency, Oe &frac14; oe/2.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the four-pole field shown in Fig. 17.6 has two diametri-
</p>
<p>cally positioned poles of the same polarity. During one period of variation of
</p>
<p>electrical variables, both poles shift by p; hence, they switch their places.

<p>In general, when stator windings are arranged to make a rotating magnetic field

<p>with 2p poles, the synchronous speed of the field rotation is Oe &frac14; oe/p. The torque
of multipole induction machines is determined on the basis of expression Tem &frac14;
Pd/Oe &frac14; pPd/oe, according to (17.3).
</p>
<p>By changing the number of magnetic poles, windings obtain a different number

<p>17.5 Characteristics of Multipole Machines
</p>
<p>Multipole machines (p &gt; 1) make better use of the copper and iron compared to two-
polemachines. There are applications of inductionmachineswhere selection of higher
</p>
<p>number of poles offers higher specific torque and power compared to the solutions
</p>
<p>involving two-pole machines. A rationale of these statements is presented here.
</p>
<p>It is known that one turn of the phase winding of two-pole machine is positioned
</p>
<p>diametrically at angular distance Dy� p. When one of these conductors is under the
north magnetic pole of the revolving field, the other is below the south pole. At the
</p>
<p>front and rear of the machine, the two conductors are connected by end turns. In
</p>
<p>two-pole machines, end turns are relatively long. Their length is one half of the
</p>
<p>machine circumference. Longer conductors contribute to increased consumption of
</p>
<p>486 17 Variable Speed Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>copper, higher resistance of the winding, and higher losses in copper. In multipole
</p>
<p>machines, conductors making one turn are placed at angular distance Dy � p/p,
which corresponds to the distance between the two magnetic poles. Length of the
</p>
<p>end turns in multipole machines is much shorter, which reflects favorably to
</p>
<p>the total mass of consumed copper, reduces winding resistance, and reduces
</p>
<p>power losses.
</p>
<p>Moreover, multipole machines make a more efficient use of ferromagnetic
</p>
<p>materials. Magnetic field lines pass from the zone of the north magnetic pole of
</p>
<p>the stator, pass through the air gap, enter the rotor magnetic circuit, pass through
</p>
<p>the air gap for the second time, and reach the zone of the south magnetic pole of the
</p>
<p>stator. Following that, the field lines pass through the stator yoke and return to the
</p>
<p>north pole. Passing tangentially along the stator perimeter, the field lines in a two-
</p>
<p>pole machine cover the angular distance of Dy � p. Passing tangentially, the field
lines do not pass through the zone where the stator slots are located. Instead, they
</p>
<p>pass through the outer part of the stator magnetic circuit called yoke. The yoke is
</p>
<p>required to reduce magnetic resistance on the flux path. On the other hand, the field
</p>
<p>passing through the yoke does not contribute to electromechanical conversion.
</p>
<p>Instead, it increases the iron weight and the total mass of the machine. In multipole
</p>
<p>machines, the path covered by the field lines between the two magnetic poles is
</p>
<p>shorter, and it is equal to Dy� p/p. Hence, the flux path through the yoke is shorter,
and the iron usage is improved.
</p>
<p>17.5.1 Mains-Supplied Multipole Machines
</p>
<p>Synchronous speed of mains-supplied machines is determined by the line frequency
</p>
<p>fe, and it is equal toOe &frac14; 2pfe/p. Their specific power depends on the number of pole
pairs. It can be determined by considering the relation between the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque and the size of the machine. It has been shown in the preceding sections that
</p>
<p>the available torque of the machine depends on its volume, resulting in proportion3
</p>
<p>Tem ~ V ~ D
2L, where D and L are diameter and axial length of the machine. With
</p>
<p>Tem &frac14; Pd/Oe &frac14; pPd/(2pfe), one obtainsV ~ pPd, namely, the size ofmains-supplied
multipole induction machine increases with the number of poles. Given the air-gap
</p>
<p>power Pd, dimensions of the machine are proportional to V ~ D
2L ~ pPd. In case
</p>
<p>where the power of the induction machine is predefined, its size is proportional to p.
</p>
<p>As an example, one can compare masses of standard induction motors with rated
</p>
<p>power of 1.1 kW, designed for the line voltage of US &frac14; 400 V and for the rated
frequency of f &frac14; 50 Hz. While two-pole motor has a mass of m � 8 kg, four-pole
motor has m � 13 kg, six-pole motor has m � 16 kg, and eight-pole motor has
m � 23 kg. Practical values of motor masses are different from prediction m � k∙p
owing to the effects that were neglected in the preceding analysis.
</p>
<p>3Electromagnetic torque depends on the fourth power of linear dimensions. Hence, Tem ~ V
4/3.

<p>17.5.2 Multipole Machines Fed from Static Power Converters
</p>
<p>In applications of induction machines fed from static power converters, it is
</p>
<p>possible to adjust the supply frequency and the synchronous speed according to
</p>
<p>needs. Static power converters are mostly transistorized inverters which use the
</p>
<p>pulse width modulation (PWM) to provide symmetric, three-phase system of
</p>
<p>voltages of variable frequency and variable amplitude. With the possibility of
</p>
<p>changing the stator supply frequency, the same synchronous speed Oe &frac14; oe/p can
be obtained with machines having different number of poles. Hence, there is a
</p>
<p>choice to select the number of poles in order to make a better use of the copper and
</p>
<p>iron. Two-pole machines have lower specific torque and lower specific power
</p>
<p>than equivalent four-pole and six-pole machines. In sample design where the
</p>
<p>induction machine is expected to run with the rotor speed Om, it is necessary to
</p>
<p>supply the stator voltages which create magnetic field which revolves at the speed
</p>
<p>of Oe � Om. One way to accomplish that is by selecting a two-pole machine and
setting the supply frequency to oe &frac14; Oe or by selecting a multipole machine
(p &gt; 1) and setting the supply frequency to oe &frac14; pOe. In both cases, the machine
has the same synchronous speed, develops the same electromagnetic torque, and
</p>
<p>gives the same power. With multipole machine (p &frac14;2, 3, or 4), specific power is
higher due to improved usage of iron and copper. Therefore, multipole induction
</p>
<p>machine is smaller and lighter. It should be noted that these advantages of
</p>
<p>multipole machines are lost in the case when the number of poles is extremely
</p>
<p>high. In such cases, stator frequencies oe &frac14; pOe are exceptionally high, and this
leads to a significant increase in iron losses. In designing magnetic circuits of
</p>
<p>induction machines operating with high frequencies, magnetic circuit cannot be
</p>
<p>made of iron sheets. Instead, ferrites or other special ferromagnetic materials have
</p>
<p>to be used.
</p>
<p>17.5.3 Shortcomings of Multipole Machines
</p>
<p>Angular frequency of the stator currents and voltages required for the given rotor
</p>
<p>speed depends on the number of poles, oe &frac14; pOe. With the target speed of Om �
Oe, the stator frequency is approximately equal to pOm. Hence, with inverter-
</p>
<p>supplied machines that have variable supply frequency, the same rotor speed can
</p>
<p>be achieved with lower number of poles 2p and lower supply frequency or with
</p>
<p>multiple pole pairs and higher supply frequency. It is known that losses in magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit due to eddy currents are proportional to the square of the frequency, while
</p>
<p>hysteresis losses grow linearly with the frequency. Therefore, specific iron losses in
</p>
<p>multipole machines are larger than specific losses in two-pole machine. In the
</p>
<p>process of the machine design, it is necessary to envisage adequate cooling or to
</p>
<p>reduce the peak value of the magnetic induction Bm in order to keep the losses
</p>
<p>within permissible limits.
</p>
<p>488 17 Variable Speed Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>With multipole machines, it is more difficult to achieve quasisinusoidal
</p>
<p>distribution of stator conductors. Stator winding is formed by placing conductors
</p>
<p>of the same reference direction
N
</p>
<p>under one magnetic pole and conductors of the
</p>
<p>opposite reference direction
J
</p>
<p>under the opposite magnetic pole. In two-pole
</p>
<p>machines, the width of magnetic poles is close to Dy � p. In multipole machines,
the width of magnetic poles is Dy � p/p. Therefore, conductors of the same
reference direction are placed within the angular interval Dy � p/p, p times
narrower than in the case of a two-pole machine. Conductors of the stator winding
</p>
<p>are placed in the stator slots. For a machine having NZ slots, there are a finite
</p>
<p>number of discrete locations where the conductors could be placed. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>conductors cannot have an ideal sinusoidal distribution. Instead, they are distributed
</p>
<p>into a finite number of slots in a way that creates an approximate, quasisinusoidal
</p>
<p>distribution. For multipole machines, the range of Dy �p/p comprises p times less
slots than the range Dy �p of two-pole machines. Hence, with p &gt; 1, it is even
more difficult to accomplish distribution of conductors which is close to sinusoidal.
</p>
<p>As a consequence, induced electromotive forces in multipole machines could have
</p>
<p>an increased amount of higher harmonics, increased cogging torque, and increased
</p>
<p>losses due to higher harmonics.
</p>
<p>Question (17.1): The torque of multipole induction machines is determined by
Tem &frac14; Pd/Oe &frac14; pPd/oe. Considered is an induction machine of axial length L and
diameter D. The stator windings can be made so as to create magnetic field with an
</p>
<p>arbitrary number of pole pairs p. Is it possible to increase the available torque by
</p>
<p>increasing the number of poles?
</p>
<p>Answer (17.1): For a given value of maximum induction Bmax and given value of
permissible current density in conductors, the torque available from an electrical
</p>
<p>machine is proportional to l4, the fourth power of linear dimensions, or V4/3, where
</p>
<p>V is the machine volume. Therefore, for the machine of given dimensions, the way
</p>
<p>of making the stator winding cannot have major impact on the available torque. In
</p>
<p>other words, the available torque does not depend on the number of magnetic poles.
</p>
<p>This conclusion can also be derived by representing the torque generation process
</p>
<p>as the interaction of electrical current in rotor bars with magnetic field created by
</p>
<p>the stator. Due to a limited current density, electrical current in rotor bars cannot be
</p>
<p>increased, and their limit is unaffected by the number of poles. Magnetic induction
</p>
<p>Bm is determined by the characteristics of iron sheets. Electromagnetic torque
</p>
<p>depends on electrical currents in rotor bars, magnetic induction, the rotor length,
</p>
<p>and radius. By neglecting the secondary effects, it can be concluded that the torque
</p>
<p>of an induction machine of given dimensions does not depend on the number of
</p>
<p>poles, namely, it does not depend on the method of making the stator windings.
</p>
<p>Question (17.2): A four-pole induction machine designed for mains supply of
3 � 400 V, 50 Hz, has the rated power Pn. The stator winding is removed from the
stator slots. New stator winding is made, designed for the same power supply
</p>
<p>conditions, producing two magnetic poles. Make an estimate of the rated power
</p>
<p>of the new machine.
</p>
<p>17.5 Characteristics of Multipole Machines 489</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Answer (17.2): The power is product of the rotor speed and the electromagnetic
torque. Rewinding a four-pole machine with a two-pole winding doubles the
</p>
<p>synchronous speed and, hence, the rotor speed. The torque depends on magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B and the sum of electrical currents in individual slots. Assuming that the
</p>
<p>flux density B in the air gap does not change much and that the current density
</p>
<p>remains the same, the two-pole machine will generate the torque comparable to the
</p>
<p>torque delivered by the original, four-pole machine. Hence, the two-pole machine
</p>
<p>has the potential of delivering 2Pn.
</p>
<p>Question (17.3): It has been shown that stator winding of an induction machine
can be wound so that it creates a rotating magnetic field with four or more magnetic
</p>
<p>poles. Does the number of poles influence the rotor construction?
</p>
<p>Answer (17.3): Rotor of a squirrel cage induction machine consists of a relatively
large number of bars which are short-circuited by conducting rings at both rotor
</p>
<p>ends, at the front and the rear. The electromotive forces and currents in short-
</p>
<p>circuited rotor contours depend on the speed of the rotor relative to the field, that is,
</p>
<p>on the slip speed Oslip &frac14; oslip/p and on magnetic induction in the air gap. Under the
north magnetic pole of the rotating field, induced rotor currents have one direction,
</p>
<p>while under the south magnetic pole of the rotating field, they are of the opposite
</p>
<p>direction. Therefore, the number of poles of the consequential rotor field is deter-
</p>

<p>17.6 Two-Speed Stator Winding
</p>
<p>Change in the synchronous speed of an induction machines and change in the rotor
</p>
<p>speed can be accomplished by changing the number of poles. In order to accomplish
</p>
<p>that, it is necessary to have the possibility of changing the stator winding so as to
</p>
<p>change the number of magnetic poles of the stator magnetomotive force. In
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.7, stator winding of an induction motor is shown with each of the
</p>
<p>three-phase windings made of two sections. Sections a1 and a2 of phase winding
</p>
<p>a are made to create magnetomotive forces of the same course but of opposite
</p>
<p>directions. With connection shown on the right-hand side of the figure, the stator
</p>
<p>winding creates a four-pole magnetic field. In the left side of the figure, direction
</p>
<p>of phase currents in sections a1, b1, and c1 is maintained, while direction of phase
</p>
<p>currents in sections a2, b2, and c2 is changed. In each phase, both sections create
</p>
<p>magnetomotive forces in the same direction, and they create two-pole
</p>
<p>magnetic field.
</p>
<p>The motion of the stator magnetomotive force vector during one third of the
</p>
<p>supply voltage period T &frac14; 1/fe is shown in Fig. 17.8 for two-pole and four-pole
configurations.
</p>
<p>Change of the rotor speed by means of changing the number of poles requires
</p>
<p>commutation of internal connections between the stator sections. This change is to

<p>be made in the course of the machine operation. In order to perform these changes,
</p>
<p>it is necessary to operate dedicated switches that make or break connections
</p>
<p>between individual sections and to achieve the winding configuration that results
</p>
<p>in desired number of poles and desired synchronous speed. The speed is usually
</p>
<p>changed automatically, in the absence of operator. Therefore, the state of the
</p>
<p>switches is controlled from a digital controller which issues command voltages.
</p>
<p>The need for a number of controlled switches makes the application relatively
</p>
<p>complex. In addition to that, additional shortcoming of the speed variation by
</p>
<p>changing the number of poles is discontinuous nature of this kind of control.
</p>
<p>Namely, the rotor speed cannot exhibit continuous change. Instead, one can select
</p>
<p>two or three discrete values of synchronous speed, and this is accomplished by
</p>
<p>connecting the stator windings in two or three configurations.

<p>Question (17.4): A two-pole induction machine designed for mains supply
develops the breakdown torque at the speed of nb &frac14; 2,000 rpm. The stator winding
is removed and a four-pole winding is built instead. Determine the speed where the
</p>
<p>four-pole machine develops the breakdown torque.
</p>
<p>Answer (17.4): Electromagnetic torque is equal to the ratio of the air-gap power
and synchronous speed. The air-gap power is the highest at the relative slip sb &frac14;
RR/(Lgeoe), that is, at the rotor frequency ofob &frac14; RR/Lge. Therefore, the breakdown
torque is developed at the rotor frequency that does not depend on the number of
</p>
<p>poles. Relative value of the breakdown slip is equal to sb &frac14; (ne�nb)/ne &frac14; 1/3. For
the two-pole machine, nb &frac14; 2,000 rpm, while for the four-pole machine, the speed
that results in the breakdown torque is nb &frac14; ne(1�sb) &frac14; 1,500(1�sb) &frac14; 1,000 rpm.

<p>17.8 Supplying from a Source of Variable Frequency
</p>
<p>Preceding sections discussed traditional approaches for changing the rotor speed of
</p>
<p>induction machines, specifically:
</p>
<p>&bull; Variation of the stator voltage
</p>
<p>&bull; Variation of the rotor resistance
</p>
<p>&bull; Variation of the number of poles

<p>Their drawbacks are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Difficult implementation
</p>
<p>&bull; High energy losses
</p>
<p>&bull; No possibility to achieve continuous speed change over a wide range
</p>
<p>Continuous speed variation over a wide range relies on power converters which
</p>
<p>make use of transistor switches. They operate on the basis of pulse width modula-
</p>
<p>tion and provide the possibility for continuous variation of the supply frequency,
</p>
<p>which results in continuous variation of the synchronous speed and, hence, the rotor
</p>
<p>speed. In this way, variable speed is obtained without the need to operate the
</p>
<p>induction machine with increased slip frequencies. Therefore, there is no increase
</p>
<p>in conversion losses due to the speed change. Moreover, there is no need to use
</p>
<p>wound rotor, slip rings, or any special design of induction machine. Subsequent
</p>
<p>sections provide a brief introduction to variable frequency supply of induction
</p>
<p>machines.
</p>
<p>17.9 Variable Frequency Supply
</p>
<p>It is of interest to investigate the nature of the stator voltages in variable speed
</p>
<p>induction machines. In phase a of the stator winding, the current is ia(t), and the flux
</p>
<p>is Ca(t). Assuming that the leakage flux is small, the flux of the phase winding a
</p>
<p>comes as a consequence of the rotating magnetic field. At the instant when the
</p>
<p>vector of the rotating field is aligned with the axis of the phase a, the flux Ca(t)
</p>
<p>reaches its maximum value Cm. With revolving field, the flux in phase a varies
</p>
<p>according to sinusoidal law. Phase voltage is equal to ua(t) &frac14; RS ia(t) &thorn; dCa(t)/dt.
The change of the phase voltage ua is shown in Fig. 17.9. Neglecting the voltage
</p>
<p>drop across the stator resistance, one obtains
</p>
<p>ua &frac14; ua �
dCas
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14; oeCm sin&eth;oet� &rsquo;&THORN;: (17.4)
</p>
<p>Slip of induction machines is relatively small; thus, the frequency of power
</p>
<p>supply is determined from the rotor speed, oe &frac14; pOe &frac14; p(Om &thorn; Oslip) � pOm.
Therefore, variation of the rotor speed requires the power supply for the stator

<p>winding which provides a three-phase system of voltages with variable frequency
</p>
<p>and variable amplitude (Cmoe). Continuous change in the rotor speed requires
</p>
<p>continuous change of the voltage amplitude and frequency. Therefore, PWM
</p>
<p>controlled three-phase inverters are required to provide continuous change of
</p>
<p>both the voltage amplitude Cmoe and the period Te &frac14; 2p/oe.
</p>
<p>17.10 Power Converter Topology
</p>
<p>Simplified schematic diagram of the power converter intended for supplying
</p>
<p>induction machines is given in Fig. 17.10a, along with the shape of the line voltage
</p>
<p>obtained at the output terminals (Fig. 17.10b). The change of the voltage across the
</p>
<p>output terminals comprises a train of voltage pulses. Averaged value of this pulse-
</p>
<p>shaped waveform has sinusoidal change with adjustable amplitude and frequency.
</p>
<p>Such waveforms are fed to the stator terminals of induction machines and used for
</p>
<p>supplying three-phase machines by voltages of variable frequency and amplitude.
</p>
<p>Converter topology includes a three-phase diode rectifier with six diodes, shown in
</p>
<p>the left side of the figure. It converts AC voltages and currents, provided from the
</p>
<p>three-phase AC mains, into DC voltages and currents across the parts LDC and CDC.
</p>
<p>These parts are placed in the middle of the converter, between the rectifier and the
</p>
<p>inverter, and they are called intermediate DC circuit, DC link, or DC bus. DC
</p>
<p>voltage E across the capacitor CDC is fed to the three-phase inverter, the switching
</p>
<p>structure which makes the use of six power transistors. Each transistor is used in
</p>
<p>switching mode, namely, it is either opened (off, iCE � 0) or closed (on, uCE � 0).
Transistor power switches are organized in three groups, called inverter phases or
</p>
<p>inverter arms. Each arm has two transistor switches, connected in series and
</p>

<p>attached between the plus rail and the minus rail of the DC bus. At each instant,
</p>
<p>only one switch in each arm is turned on. Turning on both switches would result in a
</p>
<p>short circuit across the DC bus circuit. Turning the upper switch on brings the
</p>
<p>output phase to the potential of positive DC bus rail. Turning the lower switch on
</p>
<p>brings the output phase to the potential of negative DC bus rail.
</p>
<p>17.11 Pulse Width Modulation
</p>
<p>By taking the negative rail of the DC link circuit for the reference potential, turning
</p>
<p>on of the upper switch results in phase voltage ua &frac14; +E, while turning on the lower
switch results in ua &frac14; 0. The same applies for the phase voltages ub and uc. Hence,
the phase voltages take discrete values u &isin; {0, +E}. At the same time, line-to-line
</p>
<p>voltages such as uab &frac14; ua�ub may take the values u &isin; {�E, 0, +E}. Hence, the
instantaneous value of the line voltage cannot be changed in continuous manner.
</p>
<p>Instead, it takes one of the three discrete values. However, a fast exchange of the
</p>
<p>switching states results in a train of pulses of variable width. The width of the
</p>
<p>voltage pulses affects the average value of the voltage waveform. A continuous

<p>change of the pulse width results in a continuous change of the average value of the
</p>
<p>voltage. With a fast sequencing of the available discrete values {�E, 0, +E}, the
line voltage becomes a train of pulses. The pulses are of variable width, and they
</p>
<p>can have either positive or negative value. Variation of the width of these pulses
</p>
<p>results in variation of the average line voltage. With sinusoidal change of the pulse
</p>
<p>width, behavior of the electrical machine supplied from the three-phase PWM
</p>
<p>inverter is very much the same as behavior of the same machine fed from an
</p>
<p>ideal voltage source with smooth, sinusoidal change of instantaneous voltages
</p>
<p>brought across the stator terminals.
</p>
<p>17.12 Average Value of the Output Voltage
</p>
<p>Power transistors in three-phase inverters commutate a number of times within each
</p>
<p>period of the supply voltage. The frequency of commutation fPWM of semiconductor
</p>
<p>power switches in a three-phase transistor inverter is usually close to 10 kHz or
</p>
<p>higher. Phase voltage ua(t) is a train of pulses that repeat each 1/fPWM. During each
</p>
<p>period T &frac14; 1/fPWM &frac14; 100 ms, the switching state where the upper switch is turned
on is maintained over time interval tON, where 0 &lt; tON &lt; T, while the switching
state where the lower switch is turned on is maintained during the rest of the period.
</p>
<p>The shape of the phase voltage is shown in Fig. 17.11. The average voltage within
</p>
<p>each commutation period T is proportional to the pulse width tON. When the
</p>
<p>potential of the negative rail of the DC link is taken as the reference potential, the
</p>
<p>phase voltage over the interval 0 &lt; t &lt; tON is equal to &thorn; E, while the voltage
during the remaining part of the period T is ua &frac14; 0. Continuous variation of tON

<p>17.13 Sinusoidal Output Voltages
</p>
<p>The width of the voltage pulses that constitute the phase voltage can be varied or
</p>
<p>modulated. Variation of the pulse width is called pulse width modulation (PWM).
</p>
<p>Starting from the expression ua
av &frac14; E(tON/T), desired average voltage uaav can be
</p>
<p>used to calculate the time tON, which determines the average value of the phase
</p>
<p>voltage within one switching period T &frac14; 1/fPWM.
In order to achieve variation of the average voltage value ua
</p>
<p>av(t), that is, to obtain
</p>
<p>the phase voltage that changes the average value in successive switching periods T,
</p>
<p>the pulse width tON should change as tON(t) &frac14; T uaav(t)/Е. As a matter of fact, it is not
correct towrite tON(t), as the pulsewidth assumes one discrete value in each switching
</p>
<p>period T. Namely, the pulse width over the period [nT..(n &thorn; 1)T] is determined by
discrete value tON(n) &frac14; T uaav(n)/Е. If fe &frac14; 50 Hz is the desired frequency of
the phase voltage, while&rsquo; is the initial phase, and the number 0 &lt; A &lt; 1 determines
the desired amplitude, the pulse width should be varied according to

</p>
<p>parameters fe and &rsquo;. Commutation frequency fPWM has to be considerably higher
than the desired frequency of the phase voltage, fe &lt; &lt; fPWM. In the expression for
ua
</p>
<p>av(n), there is a DC component of the voltage which is equal to E/2. This is the
</p>
<p>consequence of selecting the negative rail of the DC bus for the reference potential
</p>
<p>V0. By turning on the upper switchQ1 in Fig. 17.10a, the phase voltage ua is equal to
</p>
<p>E. With Q2 turned on, ua &frac14; 0. Other choices for reference potential result in
different values of the phase voltage ua.
</p>
<p>DC component in the phase voltages is equal in all three phases. It has no impact
</p>
<p>on the operation of the induction machine. Namely, the stator winding is connected
</p>
<p>to three-phase inverter by three conductors, and the operation of the machine is
</p>
<p>determined by line-to-line voltages. Line-to-line voltage uab is equal to ua-ub.
</p>
<p>Subtracting the two-phase voltages removes the DC components. It is of interest
</p>
<p>to point out that the choice of the reference potential is arbitrary one. Therefore, it
</p>
<p>cannot have an impact on the operation of the electrical machine. In order to
</p>
<p>confirm this statement, one can calculate the line voltage uab
av(t) as the difference
</p>
<p>between the phase voltages ua
av(t) and ub

<p>Digital implementation of the pulse width modulation implies that parameters A,

<p>fe, and &rsquo; are the numbers represented by binary record in RAM memory. They can
be adjusted to the needs of the actual operating regime of the induction machine.
</p>
<p>Within each period Te &frac14; 1/fe of phase voltages, there are a finite number of
pulses. The width of these pulses is modulated (changed) in the way to obtain
</p>
<p>sinusoidal change of the average value uav(t).
</p>
<p>The process of approximating sinusoidal change of the phase voltage by means

<p>of a finite train of pulse width-modulated impulses has similarities with the proce-

<p>dure of making distributed windings with quasisinusoidal distribution of conductors
</p>
<p>placed in a finite number of slots.
</p>
<p>17.14 Spectrum of PWM Waveforms
</p>
<p>Sinusoidal PWM is used to obtain a sequence of variable width pulses. Averaged
</p>
<p>pulses provide the phase voltages of the desired frequency fe. When the pulse width
</p>
<p>has sinusoidal change, according to expression tON(n) &frac14; (T/2) [1&thorn; Asin(2pfe nT�&rsquo;)],
the average values with each switching period T &frac14; 1/fPWM change according to
expression uav(n)�(E/2) &thorn; (E/2) A sin(2pfe nT�&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>The commutation frequency fPWM has to be considerably higher than the desired
</p>
<p>frequency of the phase voltage, fe &lt;&lt; fPWM, so as to obtain a smooth, gradual
change of average voltage between the successive switching periods T &frac14; 1/fPWM
and to obtain the operation similar to feeding the machine from an ideal source. The
</p>
<p>frequency fe of the phase voltages determines the synchronous speed, and it is called
</p>
<p>basic or fundamental. It ranges from several tens to several hundreds of cycles per
</p>
<p>second. The frequency fPWM is called commutation or switching frequency, and it

</p>
<p>influence on line voltages. The fundamental AC component at the basic frequency
</p>
<p>fe is the desired result, the voltage required across the stator terminals. It has
</p>
<p>adjustable amplitude and adjustable frequency. Assuming that the high-frequency
</p>
<p>content of the spectrum can be neglected, the three-phase inverter with PWM
</p>
<p>control can be regarded as the source of sinusoidal voltages with adjustable
</p>
<p>amplitude and adjustable fundamental frequency fe.
</p>
<p>Spectral component at the switching frequency fPWM &frac14; 1/T � 10 kHz is the
consequence of the pulsating nature of the three-phase inverter. Component of the
</p>
<p>voltage at the switching frequency has the amplitude determined by the DC link
</p>
<p>voltage E. Due to considerable amplitude, the effects of this frequency component
</p>
<p>cannot be neglected. The effects of the pulsed supply on an induction machine
</p>
<p>should be analyzed in order to establish the impact of pulsating voltage on the
</p>
<p>machine and verify whether this way of supplying the stator winding is acceptable.
</p>
<p>Subsequent discussion proves that the stator current, the electromagnetic torque,
</p>
<p>and the rotor speed of an induction machine, supplied from PWM controlled three-
</p>
<p>phase inverter, resemble the current, torque, and speed obtained with an equivalent
</p>
<p>source of smooth, sinusoidal phase voltages. Therefore, the operation with PWM

<p>power supply can be considered equivalent to the operation with an ideal source of

</p>
<p>The voltage balance in the phase winding a is given by the equation ua(t) &frac14; RSia(t)
&thorn; dCa/dt. The flux Ca can be represented as sum of the mutual flux Cma, which
passes through the air gap and encircles both stator and rotor windings, and the
</p>
<p>leakage flux of the stator winding, which is proportional to the leakage inductance
</p>

dCma/dt, where Lgia(t) is the leakage flux in the phase a of the stator winding.

<p>balance equation reduces to ua(t) &frac14; RSia(t) &thorn; Lgdia(t)/dt.
By applying Laplace transform on previous differential equation, one obtains
</p>
<p>complex image of the stator current, Ia(s) &frac14; Ua(s)/(RS &thorn; sLg). Function W(s) &frac14;
1/(RS &thorn; sLg) represents transfer function of the stator winding, which is the ratio of
the complex image of the stator current and the complex image of the stator voltage.
</p>
<p>Transfer functionW(s) provides the means to calculate the stator current response to
</p>
<p>excitation by the stator voltage of known amplitude and frequency. In the case of
</p>
<p>interest, the voltage excitation has the switching frequency fPWM. The function is
</p>
<p>obtained by neglecting slow-varying electromotive force; thus, it is applicable for
</p>
<p>calculating the response at frequencies as high as fPWM, but it cannot be used for the
</p>
<p>analysis of the machine response to lower excitation frequencies, such as the
</p>
<p>fundamental frequency fe.
</p>
<p>The ratio of the current and voltage at the frequency o &frac14; 2p/T &frac14; 2pfPWM is
obtained by introducing s &frac14; jo in function W(s); thus, the function assumes the
formW(jo) &frac14; 1/(RS &thorn; joLg). At switching frequencies of the order of several kHz,
it is justified to introduce the assumption RS &lt;&lt; oLg and to obtain relation jI(-
jo)/U(jo)j � 1/(Lgo). This expression shows that electrical machines behave as
low-pass filters. When exposed to high-frequency voltages, the stator current
</p>
<p>response to such excitation is smaller as the excitation frequency increases. In
</p>
<p>other words, low-frequency excitation has much larger impact on the stator currents
</p>
<p>than high-frequency excitation. At frequencies close to fPWM � 10 kHz, reactance
Lgo is so large that the voltage pulses have a very small influence on the stator
</p>
<p>currents. Typical change of the phase current of an induction machine supplied
</p>
<p>from three-phase PWM inverter is shown in Fig. 17.12.
</p>
<p>With pulsed supply, the phase voltages exceed the desired sinusoidal waveform
</p>
<p>during tON and then fall below during the reminder of the PWM switching period.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the stator currents oscillate around their mean values. These oscillations
</p>
<p>have the frequency of the switching bridge fPWM &frac14; 1/T &frac14; o/(2p). When the
switching frequency is sufficiently high, the amplitude of these oscillations is rather
</p>
<p>small, and their effect on the operation of the induction machine can be neglected.
</p>
<p>An estimate of the amplitude of oscillations of the stator current can be obtained by
</p>
<p>using expression jI(jo)/U(jo)j � 1/(Lgo). This expression is applicable for excita-
tion by sinusoidal voltages of the frequency o &frac14; 2p fPWM. The three-phase
switching inverter does not output sinusoidal waveforms at the switching fre-
</p>
<p>quency. Instead, it provides rectangular voltage pulses of the period 1/fPWM.
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the formula can be used to obtain a rough estimate of the stator current
</p>
<p>oscillations, also called ripple. In most cases, the current ripple amounts from 1% to
</p>
<p>5% of the rated current.
</p>
<p>Question (17.5): Induction machine of rated frequency fen &frac14; 50 Hz has an equiv-
alent leakage reactance xge &frac14; 20%. The machine is supplied from a three-phase
transistor inverter of the switching frequency fPWM &frac14; 10 kHz. Provide an estimate
of the stator current ripple that appears due to pulsed power supply.
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Answer (17.5): The amplitude of the pulses generated by the switching source and
supplied to the stator winding terminals is equal to the voltage E of the DC link
</p>
<p>circuit. Voltage E must be sufficient to provide the rated AC voltage at the inverter
</p>
<p>output. Hence, for the purpose of making an estimate, the DC link voltage can be
</p>
<p>assumed to have the relative value of E � 1. The leakage reactance Xge at the rated
frequency fen has relative value of xge &frac14; 0.2. The switching frequency is 200 times
higher than the rated frequency. Reactance is proportional to the frequency. At the
</p>
<p>switching frequency, the relative value of the reactance is xge(PWM) &frac14; xge(fPWM/fe)
&frac14; 40, that is, 4,000%. The ripple current comes as the quotient of the voltage,
having the relative value of 1, and the leakage reactance at the switching frequency.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the relative value of the current ripple due to pulsed supply is estimated
</p>
<p>as DI � 1/x
ge(PWM)
</p>
<p>&frac14;2.5%.
Question (17.6): Induction motor is supplied from a three-phase transistor inverter
with DC link voltage E and with the switching frequency of fPWM &frac14; 1/T. The speed
of rotation is equal to zero; thus, the electromotive force induced in the stator
</p>
<p>winding can be neglected. Resistance of the stator winding is also negligible. The
</p>
<p>leakage inductance Lge of the motor is known. It can be assumed that potential of
</p>
<p>the star point node is in between the positive and negative DC bus rails and it is
</p>
<p>chosen for the reference potential. Determine the shape and amplitude of
</p>
<p>oscillations of the stator current in the case when tON &frac14; T/2.
Answer (17.6): With reference potential point in between the DC bus rails, the
output phase voltage can be either &thorn; E/2 or �E/2. Having neglected the
electromotive force and the voltage drop across the stator resistance, the voltage
</p>
<p>balance equation reduces to ua &frac14; Lge dia/dt. During the first half of the period T,
that is, during the interval tON, the upper switch of the inverter phase a is turned on,
</p>
<p>thus Lge dia/dt &frac14; E/2. Therefore, the change of current is linear. Similar conclusion
applies for the second half of the period, when the voltage is ua &frac14; � E/2.
The current oscillates around its average value Iav with an amplitude of DI. During

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>first half of the period, it increases from Iav &ndash; DI to Iav &thorn; DI. In the second half
period, it slides back to Iav�DI. Hence, it changes by 2DI within each half period.
The change of the current is linear. Therefore, the slope dia/dt is equal to 2DI/(T/
</p>
<p>2) &frac14; (E/2)/Lge. From this expression, DI &frac14; ET/(8Lge).
</p>
<p>17.16 Frequency Control
</p>
<p>By varying the frequency of the stator winding power supply, one varies the
</p>
<p>synchronous speed Oe of induction machine. When operating with Tem &frac14; 0 and
s &frac14; 0, the rotor revolves at the synchronous speed, thus Om &frac14; Oe. Therefore,
continuous change of the supply frequency contributes to continuous change of
</p>
<p>the no load speed. Considering the mechanical characteristic Tem(Om), the stator
</p>
<p>supply frequency determines the intersection with the abscissa. For that reason, the
</p>
<p>frequency changes would affect as well the rotor speed of loaded induction
</p>
<p>machines. A family of mechanical characteristics obtained by varying the stator
</p>
<p>frequency is shown in Fig. 17.13.
</p>
<p>In addition to the no load speed, mechanical characteristic of an induction
</p>
<p>machine is also characterized by the breakdown torque, breakdown slip, and
</p>
<p>stiffness S &frac14; jDTem/DOmj. Breakdown slip Ob &frac14; pob &frac14; pRR/Lge is determined by
the machine parameters, and it does not depend on the power supply frequency. The
</p>
<p>breakdown torque Tb &frac14; (3p/4)CS2/Lge and the stiffness of the mechanical charac-
teristic S &frac14; kCS2/RR both depend on the square of the stator flux CS2. The ampli-
tude of the stator flux depends on the ratio of the power supply voltage and
</p>
<p>frequency. While operating with the rotor speeds lower than the rated speed On, it
</p>
<p>is desirable to maintain the rated flux, that is, the maximum flux that can be
</p>
<p>achieved within the machine. At high speeds, it is necessary to perform the field
</p>
<p>weakening and to operate with the flux inversely proportional to the speed. With
</p>
<p>Om &gt; On, the flux has to be reduced in order to maintain the stator voltage US
within the limits of the rated voltage Un.
</p>
<p>To achieve flux control, it is necessary to perform simultaneous change of the
</p>
<p>supply voltage and the supply frequency. Relation between the voltage, frequency,
</p>
<p>and flux is derived from the equivalent circuit. The voltage balance equation of the
</p>
<p>stator winding of an induction machine which operates at steady state is
</p>
<p>Us &frac14; RsIs &thorn; joe&eth;LgsIs &thorn;Cm&THORN;: (17.8)
</p>
<p>By neglecting the voltage drop across the stator resistance, voltage balance
</p>
<p>equation of the stator winding at steady state becomes US � joeCS &frac14; joeLgS &thorn;
joeCm &frac14; joeLgS iS &thorn; joeLmIm. The flux amplitude is determined by the ratio of the
maximum voltage and the supply frequency, CS�US/oe. When the stator voltages
are obtained from a three-phase transistor inverter, the frequency oe of the basic
</p>
<p>(fundamental) component determines the synchronous speed, while the quotient of
</p>
<p>the voltage amplitude and the angular frequencyoe determines the amplitude of the
</p>
<p>502 17 Variable Speed Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>stator flux. In DC machines, the excitation flux depends on electrical currents in a
</p>
<p>separate excitation winding, while the electrical power subject to electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversion is supplied through the armature winding. Hence, DC machines have
</p>
<p>two electrical ports, and these are the excitation winding terminals and the armature
</p>
<p>winding terminals. Induction machines are supplied from the stator side only.
</p>
<p>Hence, both the machine excitation and the electrical power subject to electrome-
</p>
<p>chanical conversion pass from the three-phase inverter into the stator winding
</p>
<p>terminals. The flux, torque, and power of induction machines all depend on the
</p>
<p>voltages supplied to the stator terminals.
</p>
<p>It is of interest to recall criteria for selecting the flux amplitude in various
</p>
<p>operating conditions. The torque developed in any electrical machine can be
</p>
<p>calculated as vector product of the flux and the current. Given the target torque
</p>
<p>Tem, electrical current required for the torque generation is proportional to the ratio
</p>
<p>Tem/CS, that is, it is inversely proportional to the flux. Lower currents are preferred
</p>
<p>as they lead to lower losses. Thus, it is beneficial to use higher values of the flux,
</p>
<p>whenever possible. With three-phase inverter supply, the flux is determined by the
</p>
<p>ratio of the voltage and the frequency,CS � US/oe. The flux can be increased up to
the valueCmax �Cnwhich marks the knee of the magnetizing characteristic shown
in Fig. 17.14.
</p>
<p>The flux values in excess toCmax result in saturation of the magnetic circuit. The
</p>
<p>difference between the air-gap flux (i.e., mutual flux) and the stator flux is considered
</p>
<p>negligible for the discussion in course. Therefore, with Cm � CS, the flux is deter-
mined by the magnetizing current imwhich circulates in the magnetizing branch of the
</p>
<p>equivalent circuit. This current is on the abscissa of the magnetizing characteristic
</p>

<p>Cm(im). When going above the knee point and entering the zone of magnetic satura-
</p>
<p>tion, which extends in the upper right of theCm(im) curve, any further increase of the
</p>
<p>flux is very small, and it requires considerable magnetizing current im. In all practical
</p>
<p>uses, the flux increase above the knee point is of little significance, as it requires
</p>
<p>significant increase in electrical current. Hence, with Cm &gt; Cn, a marginal flux
increment would require very high currents, accompanied by consequential copper
</p>
<p>losses. For this reason, the flux is maintained at the rated valueCn by keeping the ratio
</p>
<p>US/oe equal to Cn, unless other reasons and specific circumstances require the
</p>
<p>operation with reduced flux:

</p>
<p>17.17 Field Weakening
</p>
<p>Operation with US/oe &frac14; Cn is not always possible. At higher rotor speeds, it is
necessary to reduce the flux. In operation with Om &gt; On, it is necessary to increase
the stator frequency above the rated value. In order to keep the flux at its rated
</p>
<p>value, it is necessary to have the stator voltage of US &frac14; oeCn. With US/oe &frac14; Cn
and oe &gt; on, it is necessary to increase the stator voltage above the rated level.
</p>
<p>At steady state, the stator voltage must not exceed the rated value. Otherwise,
</p>
<p>electrical insulation of windings will be damaged. For this reason, three-phase
</p>
<p>inverters designed for the stator winding power supply are made to produce
</p>
<p>voltages within the range 0 &lt; US &lt; Un. It would not make sense to make the
power supply capable of providing the voltages that can cause damage to the
</p>
<p>machine. Therefore, three-phase inverters such as the one shown in Fig. 17.10
</p>
<p>cannot produce the output voltage which exceeds the rated voltage of the motor.
</p>
<p>Considering the operation above the rated speed, where US�Un and oe &gt; on, the
</p>

</p>
<p>504 17 Variable Speed Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>flux cannot be maintained at the rated level, and it has to be reduced. With the stator
</p>
<p>voltage equal to the rated value and, hence, constant, and with the operating
</p>
<p>frequency of the stator power supply in progressive rise, the flux of the machine
</p>
<p>is inversely proportional to the rotor speed. The expression describing the flux
</p>
<p>change at high speeds can be derived from the following discussion.
</p>
<p>With rated flux, the electromotive force in the machine is equal to oeCn. At the
</p>
<p>rated speed Om � On, the electromotive force reaches the rated voltage Un � onCn.
This discussion neglects the slip and overlooks the difference between the air-gap
</p>
<p>flux and the stator flux. With limited voltage, the rated flux cannot be maintained in
</p>
<p>operation above the rated speed. The highest sustainable voltage that is applicable
</p>
<p>to the stator terminals is the stator rated voltage Un. At speeds Om � Oe &gt; On, the
electromotive force must not exceed the rated voltage. For that to achieve, the flux
</p>
<p>must not exceed CS(oe) &frac14; Cn(on/oe). In this case, the electromotive force would
be equal to the rated voltage. At higher speeds, the flux is inversely proportional
</p>
<p>to the rotor speed and, hence, inversely proportional to the supply frequency,
</p>
<p>C ~ 1/o.
</p>
<p>For an induction machine supplied from the three-phase inverter, the stator
</p>
<p>voltage and frequency have to be changed in order to obtain desired rotor speed.
</p>
<p>Calculation of the stator voltage amplitude and frequency in terms of the rotor
</p>
<p>speed is described below.
</p>
<p>In operation below the rated speed, the stator frequency is oe &lt; on, the stator
voltage US � oeCn is proportional to frequency and lower than the rated voltage,
while the flux in the machine is constant and it has rated value:

</p>
<p>During operation at the speeds above the rated speed, stator voltage is
</p>
<p>maintained at rated value, which is the highest voltage available from the three-
</p>
<p>phase inverter. The stator frequency increases with the speed, and the flux decreases
</p>
<p>according to the lawC ~ 1/o. The machine operates in the field weakening regime:

</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is possible to envisage the family of mechanical
</p>
<p>characteristics obtained by frequency variation. In the following diagrams
</p>
<p>(Fig. 17.15) and expressions, legibility is helped by assuming that Om � Oe, as
well as oe � om &frac14; pOm. Hence, the subscript may be omitted due to assumption
o � oe � om.
</p>
<p>17.17 Field Weakening 505</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>At speeds below the rated speed, the ratio US/oe does not change, and the flux is
</p>
<p>constant. Consequently, all mechanical characteristics obtained for the supply
</p>
<p>frequencies oe &lt; on have the same value of the breakdown torque and the same
slope. By changing the supply frequency over the range of 0 &lt; oe&lt;on, a family of
mechanical characteristics is obtained having the same slope and the same break-
</p>
<p>down torque. The characteristics can be drawn by starting with natural characteris-
</p>
<p>tic, obtained with the rated frequency, and performing translation toward the origin
</p>
<p>of the T(O) diagram. At speeds above the rated speed, induction machine operates
</p>
<p>in field weakening regime. The stator voltage amplitude is maintained at the rated
</p>
<p>value, while the flux decreases according to the law CS(o) &frac14; Cn(on/oe). No load
speed of the resulting mechanical characteristics is determined by the stator supply
</p>
<p>frequency, Oe &frac14; oe/p. Since the breakdown torque Tb and the slope S are propor-
tional to the square of the flux, they decrease proportionally to the square of the
</p>
<p>speed, Tb ~ 1/o

</p>
<p>denoted by Tb(n). In field weakening region, the breakdown torque is Tb(oe) &frac14; Tb
(n)(on/oe)

<p>the speed and frequency, Tb ~ 1/o

</p>
<p>17.17.1 Reversal of Frequency-Controlled Induction Machines
</p>
<p>The rotor speed Om of induction machines is close to the synchronous speed Oe. In
</p>
<p>order to change direction of the rotor speed, it is necessary to change direction of
</p>
<p>the revolving field and invert the synchronous speed. In mains-supplied machines,
</p>
<p>changing the phase sequence results in Oe &frac14; -oe/p. Inverter-supplied machines can
be reversed without rewiring the phases.
</p>
<p>The power supply frequencyoemay take a negative value. The numberoe resides
</p>
<p>in RAM memory of digital controller, and it is used to calculate tON intervals
</p>
<p>according to expressions similar to (17.6). Entering a negative value for oe leads
</p>
<p>to generation of three-phase system of stator voltages which create magnetic field
</p>
<p>that revolves in the opposite direction. In such cases, the synchronous speed and the
</p>
<p>rotor speed change direction.

<p>Speed reversal by means of negative supply frequency does not require any
</p>
<p>change of the wiring. It is not necessary to exchange the two-phase conductors for
</p>
<p>the induction machine to change direction of rotation. It is sufficient to insert a
</p>
<p>negative value ofoe in the expression that calculates the pulse width tON(n) &frac14; (T/2)
[1+ Asin(oenT &ndash; &rsquo;)] of the voltage pulses created by the switching action of the
three-phase inverter. During the operation with oe &lt; 0, mechanical characteristic
is transferred to the second and third quadrant of the Tem-Om plane.

<p>17.18 Steady State and Transient Operating Area
</p>
<p>By varying the frequency and amplitude of the stator voltages, it is possible to
</p>
<p>achieve operation in all four quadrants of the Tem-Om plane. It is of interest to
</p>
<p>establish the steady state operating area, that is, the region of Tem-Om plane that
</p>
<p>encircles all of the operating points where the machine can operate permanently and
</p>
<p>with no damage. In a like manner, transient operating area contains the operating
</p>
<p>points that can be reached within short time intervals. Steady state operating limits
</p>
<p>of induction machine operating in the first quadrant are given in Fig. 17.16 and
</p>
<p>explained henceforth.
</p>
<p>Continuous operation of an induction machine at certain operating mode
</p>
<p>requires that the voltages and currents are within the rated limits. At the same
</p>
<p>time, the sum of the losses should be within the rated limits in order to avoid
</p>
<p>overheating and damage to the machine.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>During operation at speeds below the rated speed, the flux is maintained at the
</p>
<p>rated value. With rated currents in stator windings and with the rated flux, induction
</p>
<p>machine provides the rated torque Tn at the shaft. The rated torque is available in
</p>
<p>continuous service at all speeds where the stator frequency remains within the rated
</p>
<p>limits, joej � on.
In the field weakening region, the stator frequency exceeds the rated value,
</p>
<p>joej &gt; on. The flux varies according to the law CS(o) &frac14; Cn(on/o). For this
reason, the torque available in continuous service in the field weakening regime
</p>
<p>is inversely proportional to the rotor speed, that is, inversely proportional to the
</p>
<p>stator frequency. The torque available in the field weakening operation can be
</p>
<p>represented by expression

</p>
<p>which defines boundaries of the steady state operating area in the zone of higher
</p>
<p>speeds (Fig. 17.16).
</p>
<p>17.19 Steady State Operating Limits
</p>
<p>Steady state operating limits of relevant variables are shown in Fig. 17.17. Any value
</p>
<p>that does not exceed the limits is sustainable in continuous operation. The limits are
</p>
<p>given for the voltage, current, stator frequency, torque, flux, and power of an

<p>induction machine supplied from variable frequency, variable voltage source. For
</p>
<p>clarity of diagrams, it is assumed that O � Oe � Om. The region Om &lt; On below
the rated speed is called constant flux or constant torque region. The regionOm &gt; On
above the rated speed is called flux weakening region or constant power region.
</p>
<p>Diagrams in Fig. 17.17 represent the change of steady state operating limits for
</p>
<p>US, IS, Tem, P, andCS. Therefore, they comprise only the first quadrant with O &gt; 0.
However, the limits such as Tem(Om) apply to all the four quadrants of Tem-Om
plane. Namely, the same limits of the continuous service apply for both directions
</p>
<p>of the speed, and they are equally valid in motor operating mode as well as in
</p>
<p>generator operating mode. It is shown in the figure that the stator frequency
</p>
<p>oe increases proportionally to the rotor speed. By neglecting the slip, relation
</p>
<p>between the rotor speed and the stator frequency is oe � pOm. In constant flux
zone, at speeds lower than the rated speed, the ratio US/oe is kept constant. Upon
</p>
<p>reaching the rated speed, the voltage is maintained at the rated value. Further
</p>
<p>increase of the rotor speed gets the machine in the field weakening mode, where
</p>
<p>the voltage remains constant while the angular frequency of the power supply keeps
</p>
<p>increasing. This results in flux decrease. In the field weakening regime, the flux
</p>
<p>changes according to CS(o) &frac14; Cn(on/oe).
In constant flux region, the available torque is constant, while in field weakening
</p>
<p>region, the torque is limited by Tem(O) � Tn(On/Oe). The power available in
constant flux region (jOej � On) increases linearly with the speed. In field weaken-
ing, the available torque drops according to Tem ~ 1/O. Therefore, the power
</p>
<p>available in field weakening has a constant value, P(O) � OTn(On/O) &frac14; Pn.
For this reason, the field weakening region is called constant power region. By
</p>
<p>recognizing the secondary effects, which have been neglected in the first approxi-
</p>
<p>mation, it can be shown that the power available in the field weakening regime is
</p>
<p>somewhat higher than the rated power.4

<p>17.19.1 RI Compensation
</p>
<p>In the process of calculating the stator voltage, the voltage drop across the stator
</p>
<p>resistance has been neglected. For clarity, approximation US &frac14; RSIS &thorn; joeCS �
joeCS has been made. The stator resistance has a very low relative value. There-
</p>
<p>fore, this approximation does not introduce any significant error in calculations,
</p>
<p>provided that the rotor speeds are sufficiently high and that the electromotive force
</p>
<p>oeCS has the value significantly higher than the voltage drop RSIS. At very small
</p>
<p>speeds, where the electromotive force is comparable to the voltage drop RSIS, this
</p>

<p>4Due to flux decrease in the field weakening regime, the magnetizing current Im is lower than the

<p>If an induction machine operates at very small speed, the angular frequency is
</p>
<p>very small as well. Maintaining the rule that the stator voltage US is proportional to
</p>
<p>the supply frequency, the flux of the machine is obtained below the rated flux.
</p>
<p>Consider the case where the ratio U/f is retained even at very low speeds, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing the resistive voltage drop. The stator voltage is equal to US &frac14; oeCn.
Assuming that the mechanical load TL is close to zero, the machine operates with
</p>
<p>the slip of s &frac14; 0 and with IR &frac14; 0. With US &frac14; US, the stator current is equal to
IS &frac14; US/(RS &thorn; joeLS), and the stator flux is CS &frac14; LSIS &frac14; LS(US/(RS &thorn; joe LS)) &frac14;
Cn∙(jLSoe/(RS &thorn; joe LS)). In cases where oeLS &gt;&gt; RS, the stator flux amplitude is
equal to Cn, and it does not depend on the parameter RS. At very low speeds, the
</p>
<p>flux amplitude decreases due to the voltage drop RSIS.
</p>
<p>According to diagram US(O) in Fig. 17.17, the operating point Oe &frac14; oe/p &frac14;0
results in the stator voltage US &frac14; oeCn &frac14; 0. With US &frac14; 0 and RS 6&frac14; 0, the stator
flux is equal to zero as well. With low supply frequencies and with US &frac14; oeCn, the
actual stator flux is lower than the rated value. A low flux amplitude at very low
</p>
<p>frequencies reduces the start-up torque and has adverse effect on the operation of
</p>
<p>induction machines at low speeds. These effects can be reduced by changing the
</p>
<p>control law US &frac14; oeCn and increasing the supply voltage amplitude at low speeds
in the manner shown in Fig. 17.18.
</p>
<p>17.19.2 Critical Speed
</p>
<p>According to Fig. 17.17, induction machine operating in the field weakening region
</p>
<p>is capable of providing a constant rated power. This figure has been derived based
</p>
<p>upon certain assumptions. One of them is neglecting the difference between the
</p>
<p>stator flux and the air-gap flux, namely, neglecting the voltage drop across the
</p>
<p>leakage inductance. The leakage reactance is proportional to the supply frequency.
</p>
<p>At very high speeds, the operating frequency increases up to the levels where the
</p>
<p>leakage reactance cannot be neglected. Therefore, there is a limit to the constant
</p>
<p>power operation. The speed Ocr is the maximum speed where the machine is still
</p>
<p>capable of delivering the rated power. The operation above this speed is feasible but
</p>
<p>with a power lower than the rated power. The speed Ocr is called critical speed. It
</p>
<p>denotes the intersection of functions Ts(o) &frac14; Tn(on/o) and Tb(o) &frac14; Tb(n)(on/o)2.
An approximate value of the critical speed will be determined in the subsequent
</p>
<p>analysis. To keep the discussion simple, it is assumed that p &frac14; 1 and that electrical

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>frequencies o have the same values as the relevant speeds O. At the same time, the
</p>
<p>slip frequency and the slip speed are considered negligible (oslip &lt;&lt; oe, Oslip &lt;&lt;
Oe) allowing the rotor speed Om to be replaced with the synchronous speed Oe.
</p>
<p>The operation at a constant, rated power in the zone of field weakening requires
</p>
<p>the torque Ts(o) � Tn(on/o). The function Ts(o) delimits the steady state operating
limit for the torque. Namely, the curve Ts(o) expresses the maximum steady state
</p>
<p>torque at the given speed. The limit torque Ts(o) is obtained with rated stator
</p>
<p>current In. On the other hand, the envelope of breakdown torques varies according
</p>
<p>to the law Tb(o) � Tb(n)(on/o)2, where Tb(n) is the breakdown torque obtained at
the rated power supply conditions, with the rated flux. The function Tb(o)
</p>
<p>represents the maximum transient torque available at the given speed. This transient
</p>
<p>torque Tb can be maintained only for a short interval of time, as it requires the stator
</p>
<p>currents IS &gt; In, and therefore cause increased losses and temperature rise. The
function Ts(o) crosses the function Tb(o) at the speed ocr &frac14; on(Tb(n)/Tn).
</p>
<p>For speeds above ocr, the available breakdown torque Tb(o) is smaller than the
</p>
<p>torque Ts(o) � Tn(on/o) which is permissible in continuous service. Hence, the
transient torque limit falls below the torque limit in continuous service, which appears
</p>
<p>a contradiction. For the proper understanding, it is of interest to understand the
</p>
<p>difference between the functions Ts(o) and Tb(o). The curve Ts(o) represents
</p>
<p>the torque Ts which is available at the given speed of o provided that the current in
</p>
<p>the stator windings is IS &frac14; In. Hence, in a way, the curve Ts(o) represents the limit
IS &lt; In expressed in T(o) plane. It is of interest to notice that the torque values Ts(o)
are feasible only in cases where the stator current can actually reach the rated current.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the curve Tb(o) is the actual limit for the instantaneous torque. At
</p>
<p>the given speed o, the function Tb(o) provides the peak torque available from the
</p>
<p>induction machines of the given parameters. Above critical speeds, the curve Tb(o)
</p>
<p>provides the values of the breakdown torque available foro &gt; ocr. At the same time,
the values indicated by Ts(o) cannot be reached for speeds o &gt; ocr. At elevated
supply frequencies, the leakage reactance increases. With the stator voltage limited to
</p>
<p>the rated value andwith an increased leakage reactance, the stator current cannot reach
</p>
<p>the rated values. Hence, for the speeds o &gt; ocr, the stator current falls below In in
both transient and steady state service. This leads to situation where Ts(o) &gt; Tb(o).
</p>
<p>Induction machines with variable frequency supply can operate above critical
</p>
<p>speed, but their power will fall below the rated power. In this range of speeds, the
</p>
<p>available torque will drop proportionally to the square of the rotor speed, while
</p>
<p>the available power will drop proportionally the speed, P ~ 1/o. Transient and
</p>
<p>steady state operating limits of an induction machine are given in Fig. 17.19.

<p>17.20 Construction of Induction Machines
</p>
<p>Induction machines have been in use since the end of the nineteenth century. During
</p>
<p>the first hundred years of their application, the switching power transistors and other
</p>
<p>components required for variable frequency supply were not available. For that
</p>
<p>reason, induction machines were supplied from the mains, with the voltages having
</p>
<p>a constant, line frequency. Therefore, all the induction machines used in this period
</p>
<p>were designed and optimized for constant frequency operation. Starting up of the
</p>
<p>induction motors was performed by connecting them to a three-phase network of
</p>
<p>industrial frequency 50/60 Hz.
</p>
<p>17.20.1 Mains-Supplied Machines
</p>
<p>At start-up time, a mains-supplied induction motor has the rotor speed Om &frac14; 0 and
the stator voltages of the rated amplitude and frequency. The start-up current in the
</p>
<p>stator windings is IP � USn/Xge, where Xge � XgS &thorn; XgR is the equivalent leakage
reactance. Small values of the leakage reactance would result in high start-up
</p>
<p>17.20 Construction of Induction Machines 513</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>currents. A reactance of xge � 10% gives the start-up current which is 10 times
higher than the rated current. Such current results in the stator copper losses that
</p>
<p>exceed the losses under rated condition by 100 times. At the same time, large start-
</p>
<p>up currents result in considerable drop in the mains voltage and affect other
</p>
<p>electrical loads that are connected to the same line. The start-up mode of an
</p>
<p>induction motor lasts until the rotor speed comes close to the synchronous speed,
</p>
<p>where the relative slip s comes down and the impedance RR/s in the equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit obtains the value RR/s &gt; &gt; Xge, therefore causing the stator current to
decrease and come down to acceptable levels. The acceleration time depends on
</p>
<p>the load inertia J, and it can last from several hundreds of milliseconds up to several
</p>
<p>seconds. Losses in the windings during the start-up are proportional to the square of
</p>
<p>the initial current, and they cause a steep rise of the motor temperature. Therefore,
</p>
<p>the acceleration cannot last long. Unless the machine approaches the synchronous
</p>
<p>speed in a short time, it has to be disconnected from the mains in order to avoid
</p>
<p>dangerous temperatures and preserve the machine integrity. The start-up current is
</p>
<p>much higher than the rated current, and this may pose a problem for the
</p>
<p>installations, fuses, and cabling. Mains-supplied induction machines have to be
</p>
<p>designed to sustain large start-up currents without damage.
</p>
<p>In order to reduce the start-up current of mains-supplied induction machines, it is
</p>
<p>necessary to design such machines so as to provide higher leakage inductances. The
</p>
<p>leakage inductance is proportional to the ratio N2/Rm, where N is the number of turns
</p>
<p>of the relevant winding, while Rm is magnetic resistance along the path of the
</p>
<p>leakage flux. By reducing the magnetic resistance Rm, it is possible to increase the
</p>
<p>leakage inductance and leakage reactance. This would contain the start-up current
</p>
<p>of an induction machine. One of the ways to achieve this is the use of the semi-
</p>
<p>closed and closed slots in the rotor magnetic circuit (Fig. 17.20).
</p>
<p>Making the rotor slot opening toward the air-gap narrower reduces the magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance along the path of the leakage flux. With narrow top of the rotor slot, the
</p>
<p>leakage flux path through the air is made shorter, which reduces the magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance. An increase in the leakage inductance and reactance would decrease
</p>
<p>the start-up current. There are also side effects. An increase in leakage inductance
</p>
<p>reduces the breakdown torque, which is inversely proportional to the leakage
</p>
<p>reactance. In the process of designing an induction machine intended for constant
</p>
<p>frequency operation, the choice of leakage reactance is the result of a compromise.
</p>
<p>The final value should result in acceptable start-up currents, but it should not make
</p>
<p>an unacceptable reduction of the breakdown torque.

<p>At start-up of an induction motor supplied from the mains, it is necessary to
</p>
<p>develop the start-up torque TP as high as possible. This would prevail over the
</p>
<p>motion resistances TL and provide for acceleration. At start-up, the acceleration is
</p>
<p>equal to dOm/dt &frac14; (TP &ndash; TL)/J, and it strongly depends on the start-up torque. Higher
values of TP result in higher acceleration, resulting in short acceleration times, lower
</p>
<p>amount of heat caused by losses, and lower increase in temperature. Shortening the
</p>
<p>start-up reduces the thermal stress and extends the lifetime of the machine. The start-
</p>
<p>up torque TP &frac14; (3p/Oen)RRIP2 is dependent on the square of the start-up current, and
it is proportional to the rotor resistance RR. In order to increase the start-up torque, it
</p>
<p>is necessary to increase the rotor resistance RR. This can be accomplished by making
</p>
<p>the rotor bars with a smaller cross section or making them of materials with higher
</p>
<p>specific resistance, such as brass. However, an increase in the rotor resistance affects
</p>
<p>the steady state losses in the rotor windings. In rated operating condition, the copper
</p>
<p>losses in the rotor would be higher due to elevated resistance RR. This would reduce
</p>
<p>the coefficient of efficiency of the machine, increase the temperature, and eventually
</p>
<p>reduce the rated power. High efficiency during steady state regimes requires the
</p>
<p>rotor resistance to be as small as possible. At the same time, the need to maximize
</p>
<p>the start-up torque requires the use of rotor resistances as high as possible.
</p>
<p>This contradiction was resolved by making the rotor cage so as to obtain frequency
</p>
<p>dependence of the rotor resistance.
</p>
<p>The rotor winding can be designed so as to have a frequency-dependent resis-
</p>
<p>tance. Parameter RR can be made dependent on the frequency of the rotor currents,
</p>
<p>namely, on the slip frequency. In start-up mode, the slip frequency is high. It is
</p>
<p>equal to the line frequency due to the relative slip being equal to one. At steady
</p>
<p>state, the machine operates with the speeds that are close to the synchronous speed,
</p>
<p>and the slip frequency is very low, of the order to 1 Hz. The change in the slip
</p>
<p>frequency can be used to obtain variable rotor resistance that would suit the needs of
</p>
<p>mains-supplied induction machines.
</p>
<p>At start-up, it is necessary to have high values of RR in order to have a high start-
</p>
<p>up torque. Then, the frequency of the rotor currents is equal to that of the stator
</p>
<p>currents, fslip &frac14; fe &frac14; 50 Hz. Hence, it is necessary to make the rotor cage so that it
pays relatively high resistance to electrical currents of the line frequency.
</p>
<p>At steady state, the speeds are close to the rated value and to the synchronous speed.
</p>
<p>The frequency of rotor currents ismuch lower, and it is close to fslip ~ 1Hz. Equivalent
</p>
<p>resistance of the rotor cage at low frequencies should be as low as possible.
</p>
<p>By building a double cage, like the one shown in Fig. 17.21, the rotor winding can
</p>
<p>be made with frequency-dependent resistance. Low-resistance, large cross-sectional

<p>17.20 Construction of Induction Machines 515</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>bars made of copper or aluminum are placed deeper into the rotor magnetic circuit.
</p>
<p>This inner cage (B) has much smaller resistance to DC currents. Closer to the
</p>
<p>surface, there are brass bars of smaller cross section (A). Their resistance is much
</p>
<p>higher. At very low frequencies, such as the rated slip frequencies, the rotor current
</p>
<p>has a low-resistance path through the inner cage. At line frequency of 50 Hz, the
</p>
<p>inner cage reactance prevents the rotor circuits from passing through the inner cage.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the start-up current in the rotor circuit passes through the brass cage,
</p>
<p>which is closer to the air gap, which has a much higher resistance and therefore
</p>
<p>provides a higher start-up torque.
</p>
<p>It is of interest to notice that the leakage reactance of the inner cage is much
</p>
<p>higher than the leakage reactance of the brass cage. The figure shows the lines of the
</p>
<p>magnetic field of the leakage flux. The copper bars are encircled by a large number
</p>
<p>of field lines. For this reason, the leakage flux, leakage inductance, and leakage
</p>
<p>reactance are relatively high. The brass cage, placed much closer to the air gap, is
</p>
<p>encircled by a smaller number of field lines. Its leakage flux and leakage reactance
</p>
<p>are considerably smaller. At start-up, the frequency of rotor currents is fslip &frac14; fe
&frac14;50 Hz, which increases the values of rotor reactance Xg &frac14; Lg oslip &frac14; Lg oe. Due
to relatively high frequency, reactances of both cages prevail over resistances, and
</p>
<p>the impedance of each of the cages is mainly reactive, Xg &gt;&gt; RR. Since reactance
of the brass cage is considerably smaller, the rotor start-up current passes mainly
</p>
<p>through the brass cage, the cage with higher resistance. When the motor enters the
</p>
<p>steady state, the frequency of the rotor currents is considerably smaller, and it is
</p>
<p>close to fslip ~ 1 Hz. Therefore, the impedance of both cages is mainly resistive, as
</p>
<p>the resistances prevail over reactances, Xg &frac14; Lg oslip &lt;&lt; RR. Since the resistance
of the lower (copper) cage is considerably smaller, the rotor current at steady state
</p>
<p>passes mainly through the low-resistance copper bars.
</p>
<p>It can be concluded that the rotor currents in a double-cage rotor pass through the
</p>
<p>upper, brass cage during start-up, while they get shifted to the lower, copper cage
</p>
<p>during operation at steady state, where the speed is close to the synchronous speed
</p>
<p>and the slip frequency is low. In this way, the rotor resistance is made frequency
</p>
<p>dependent. At steady states close to rated operating conditions, equivalent rotor
</p>
<p>resistance is low, while during the start-up, equivalent rotor resistance is high.
</p>
<p>Manufacturing double cage increases complexity of the production process and
</p>
<p>increases the costs. Therefore, it is used mainly for machines with larger rated
</p>
<p>power and/or larger start-up torque requirements.
</p>
<p>The effects similar to those created by double cage can be obtained by designing
</p>
<p>rotor slots with an increased depth and decreased width. An example of such deep
</p>
<p>slot is shown in Fig. 17.22. The slot contains a rotor bar of rectangular cross section.
</p>
<p>With very low rotor frequencies, where the leakage reactances are of no impor-
</p>
<p>tance, the rotor current is distributed equally across the cross section of the rotor
</p>
<p>bar. The currents that pass at the bottom of the slot are encircled by a number of
</p>
<p>lines of the magnetic field, that is, by relatively large leakage flux. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, there are also currents next to the surface, facing the air gap. They are
</p>
<p>encircled by considerably lower number of field lines and have much smaller
</p>
<p>leakage flux.
</p>
<p>516 17 Variable Speed Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When the rotor bars have current of relatively high slip frequency, variable
</p>
<p>leakage flux creates electromotive force which opposes to electrical currents. The
</p>
<p>current passing through the upper part of the slot is encircled by a small leakage
</p>
<p>flux. Therefore, the reactive electromotive force for this current is smaller. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, the current passing through the lower part of the slot is buried into the
</p>
<p>rotor magnetic circuit, and it is encircled by a larger leakage flux. Thus, the reactive
</p>
<p>electromotive force for this current is much higher. It impedes the current flow and
</p>
<p>pushes the rotor current toward the air gap. An example of an uneven distribution of
</p>
<p>the rotor current is given in the right-hand side of the figure. Since the currents of
</p>
<p>relatively high slip frequency pass through a smaller part of the rotor bar cross
</p>
<p>section, the equivalent resistance of the rotor is increased. On the other hand, the
</p>
<p>current distribution at low slip frequencies is even, and the equivalent rotor resis-
</p>
<p>tance is much lower.
</p>
<p>17.20.2 Variable Frequency Induction Machines
</p>
<p>In previous section, different approaches to designing mains-supplied induction
</p>
<p>machines have been outlined. They were focus on resolving the problems of
</p>
<p>constant frequency induction machines. Most important problems include limiting
</p>
<p>the start-up current, providing sufficient start-up torque, and providing a satisfac-
</p>
<p>tory efficiency in steady state conditions.
</p>
<p>Modern induction machines are supplied from three-phase switching inverters
</p>
<p>which make use of power transistors. They produce three-phase voltage system of
</p>
<p>variable frequency and variable amplitude. Parameters of the power supply are
</p>
<p>suited to serve the target operating modes. The start-up of frequency-controlled
</p>
<p>induction machine does not imply a large start-up current. Instead, the stator
</p>
<p>frequency is reduced to the value close to the rated slip frequency, and the voltage
</p>
<p>amplitude is determined so as to produce the rated flux. In this way, development of
</p>
<p>the start-up torque does not require the stator currents that exceed the rated current,
</p>
<p>unless the motion resistances do exceed the rated torque. Hence, frequency-
</p>
<p>controlled induction machines are never exposed to rated voltage in locked rotor
</p>
<p>condition. Therefore, they do not need to have an increased leakage inductance,
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.22 A deep rotor slot
and distribution of rotor
</p>
<p>currents
</p>
<p>17.20 Construction of Induction Machines 517</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>since there is no need to limit the start-up current. Instead, they can be designed to
</p>
<p>have open slots of both stator and rotor magnetic circuits, which results in a smaller
</p>
<p>leakage flux, smaller leakage inductance, and larger breakdown torque. Example of
</p>
<p>an open slot is shown in Fig. 17.20b.
</p>
<p>In addition to higher breakdown torque, the advantage obtained by decreasing
</p>
<p>leakage inductance is the possibility to achieve faster changes of the stator current,
</p>
<p>which results in quicker torque changes. Since the electromagnetic torque of an
</p>
<p>electrical machine depends on electrical currents in the windings, the rate of change
</p>
<p>of the electromagnetic torque is dependent on the first derivative of the current,
</p>
<p>diS(t)/dt. The voltage balance equation in the stator winding can be represented by
</p>
<p>uS &frac14; RSiS &thorn; LgediS/dt &thorn; e. Therefore, the first derivative of the stator current
diS/dt &frac14; (uS &ndash; RSiS &ndash; e)/Lge is inversely proportional to the leakage inductance.
With lower leakage inductances, it is possible to achieve larger rate of change of the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque.
</p>
<p>Reduction of leakage inductance can also have negative consequences. Due to a
</p>
<p>finite number of slots carved into magnetic circuits and due to non-sinusoidal
</p>
<p>distribution of conductors, the windings of an induction machine contain
</p>
<p>electromotive forces that have higher harmonics. These harmonics cause electrical
</p>
<p>currents of the same frequency. The amplitude of such currents in rotor bars is
</p>
<p>directly proportional to the amplitudes of the relevant frequency component of the
</p>
<p>electromotive force, and inversely proportional to the winding impedance. The
</p>
<p>winding impedance at higher frequencies is determined primarily by the leakage
</p>
<p>reactance. For this reason, reduction of the leakage inductance leads to increased
</p>
<p>amplitudes of winding currents caused by higher harmonics, and increases the
</p>
<p>current ripple caused by the PWM supply. The adverse effects can be avoided by
</p>
<p>careful design of the rotor slots by shaping the stator and rotor magnetic circuits so
</p>
<p>as to reduce non-sinusoidal distribution of the field and to design the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>windings so as to reduce the electromotive forces induced due to distortions and
</p>
<p>higher harmonics.
</p>
<p>Question (17.8): Rotor bars are placed in slots which are separated by teeth. The
lines of the magnetic field are directed along the path of smaller magnetic resis-
</p>
<p>tance. Therefore, magnetic induction is high in rotor teeth and significantly lower in
</p>
<p>rotor slots. Conductors carrying rotor currents are placed in slots, where magnetic
</p>
<p>induction B is close to zero. Considering the force exerted on conductors, it depends
</p>
<p>on magnetic induction and electrical current. Apparently, this force is going to be
</p>
<p>very low. Explain the fact that, notwithstanding the abovementioned, induction
</p>
<p>machine does generate considerable torque.
</p>
<p>Answer (17.8): The torque generation can be represented as the result of forces
acting on conductors. With conductors placed in relatively deep slots, magnetic
</p>
<p>induction within the iron teeth exceeds by far the magnetic induction within
</p>
<p>aluminum-filled slots. Ratio of magnetic induction in slots and magnetic induction
</p>
<p>in teeth is close to m0/mFe. Therefore, only a very small force is acting on
</p>
<p>conductors. Instead, forces act on rotor surfaces that separate ferromagnetic
</p>
<p>materials, such as iron in magnetic circuits, from nonmagnetic materials, such as
</p>
<p>518 17 Variable Speed Induction Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>aluminum conductors or the air gap. They act on the surface walls between slots and
</p>
<p>teeth. The forces acting on the rotor teeth can be explained by using the concept
</p>
<p>called equivalent magnetic pressure.5 Calculation of spatial distribution of the
</p>
<p>magnetic field in relatively complex, three-dimensional structure such as the slotted
</p>
<p>rotor is rather involved. In most cases, it requires automated software tools. Once
</p>
<p>completed, this calculation provides the information on the equivalent magnetic
</p>
<p>pressure which is acting upon surfaces that separate iron from nonmagnetic
</p>
<p>domains. With the equivalent magnetic pressure readily available, the forces and
</p>
<p>torque can be calculated by performing surface integration along all the relevant
</p>
<p>surfaces. The outcome of such calculations is the torque value equal to the value
</p>
<p>obtained by assuming that the force LIB acts on each conductor and that magnetic
</p>
<p>field lines pass equally through slots as they do through teeth. The last assumption is
</p>
<p>equivalent to considering the machine where the rotor surface is smooth cylinder
</p>
<p>with no slots, while the rotor conductors reside in the air gap, attached to the rotor
</p>
<p>surface. In such hypothetical case, the expression F &frac14; LIB is more obvious.
</p>
<p>5Magnetic field creates forces acting on surfaces delimiting different domains. These forces can be
</p>
<p>described by introducing equivalent pressure p(N/m2). The force acting on surface S is equal to
</p>
<p>F &frac14; pS. The energy density of the magnetic field in the first domain, next to the boundary, is
w1 &frac14; m1 H12/2. Across the boundary, in the second domain, the energy density is w2 &frac14; m2 H22/2.
Equivalent pressure is equal to w1�w2.

<p>Synchronous Machines
</p>
<p>The following chapters study principles of operation, construction, mathematical
</p>
<p>model, and basic characteristics of synchronous machines. Along with induction
</p>
<p>machines, synchronous machines belong to the group of AC machines. Their
</p>
<p>operating principles are different. The rotor of induction machines revolves at the
</p>
<p>speed slightly lower than the synchronous speed, thus their name asynchronous
</p>
<p>machines. The rotor of synchronous machines revolves at the synchronous speed.
</p>
<p>In both induction and synchronous machines, revolving magnetic field is created
</p>
<p>by AC currents in the three-phase windings of the stator. The stator magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits and the stator windings of induction and synchronous machines are very
</p>
<p>much the same. In both cases, three-phase system of stator currents creates rotating
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force and rotating field of magnetic inductance. The field revolves
</p>
<p>at the speed which is determined by the angular frequency of the stator currents,
</p>
<p>also called power supply frequency. Synchronous machines and induction
</p>
<p>machines have different construction of their rotors. The rotor winding in most
</p>
<p>induction machines is a short-circuited cage made of aluminum bars which are
</p>
<p>placed in the rotor slots. Rotor in synchronous machines may have excitation
</p>
<p>winding or permanent magnets. The rotor with excitation winding is supplied
</p>
<p>with DC currents that create the rotor magnetomotive force and the rotor flux.
</p>
<p>Instead of excitation windings, rotor of synchronous machines may have permanent
</p>
<p>magnets built into the rotor magnetic circuit. In this case, the rotor does not have
</p>
<p>any windings.
</p>
<p>The principles of operation of induction machines have been described in
</p>
<p>Chap. 14. The rotor windings of an induction machine are short-circuited. When
</p>
<p>the rotor of an induction machine falls behind the revolving field by the amount of
</p>
<p>slip, the electromotive forces are induced in short-circuited rotor windings, and the
</p>
<p>rotor currents appear as a consequence. By joint action of the induced rotor currents
</p>
<p>and magnetic field, induction machine generates the electromagnetic torque, pro-
</p>
<p>portional to the slip. The torque generation process requires the rotor to revolve
</p>
<p>somewhat slower than the field, so that the revolving field advances with respect to
</p>
<p>the rotor by the amount of slip. Certain amount of slip is required in order to change
</p>
<p>the rotor flux and create electromotive forces and electrical currents in rotor bars.

<p>It has been shown in Chap. 14 that electromagnetic torque of an induction machine
</p>
<p>depends on the angular frequency of rotor currents oslip &frac14; oe-pOm, which is
determined by the rotor lagging with respect to revolving field. In rated operating
</p>
<p>conditions, the rotor of an induction machine does not rotate synchronously with
</p>
<p>the field. Therefore, induction machines are also called asynchronous machines.
</p>
<p>Rotor in synchronous machines is either an electromagnet or a permanent
</p>
<p>magnet. Position of the rotor flux is uniquely defined by the position of the rotor.
</p>
<p>In rated operating conditions, the rotor revolves synchronously with the stator field.
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic torque is proportional to the vector product of the stator and rotor
</p>
<p>flux vectors. The synchronous rotation of the rotor is the reason for this type of
</p>
<p>electrical machines to be called synchronous machines.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, basic operating principles of synchronous machines are
</p>
<p>introduced and explained. The torque generation is discussed for the machines
</p>
<p>with an excitation winding on the rotor and for the machines with permanent
</p>
<p>magnets. The construction of stator windings and stator magnetic circuit is rather
</p>
<p>similar to that of the induction machine. It is reinstated briefly, along with genera-
</p>
<p>tion of the revolving magnetic field of the stator winding. The rotor construction is
</p>
<p>explained in more detail. The available methods of supplying the DC excitation
</p>
<p>current to rotors with an excitation winding are introduced, explained, and
</p>
<p>discussed, including the sliding rings with brushes and the transformer with
</p>
<p>revolving secondary and rectifier circuit on the rotor. This chapter reviews most
</p>
<p>significant characteristics of permanent magnet materials. Two different ways of
</p>
<p>inserting permanent magnets into the rotor magnetic circuits are explained and
</p>
<p>discussed. Magnetic and electrical properties of synchronous machines with buried
</p>
<p>magnets and surface-mounted magnets are studied. In particular, the difference in
</p>
<p>self-inductance of the stator windings is discussed and explained for buried magnet
</p>
<p>machines and surface-mounted magnet machines.
</p>
<p>18.1 Principle of Operation
</p>
<p>Like induction machines, synchronous machines have AC currents in stator
</p>
<p>windings. Stator currents create the stator magnetomotive force FS which revolves
</p>
<p>at the speed Oe &frac14; oe/p, also called synchronous speed. The synchronous speed is
determined by the angular frequencyoe of stator currents and by the number of pole
</p>
<p>pairs p. The stator magnetomotive force creates the stator flux FS &frac14; FS/Rm, which
depends on magnetic resistance Rm. The fluxFS rotates at the same speed Oe as the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force. Rotor in synchronous machines may have permanent
</p>
<p>magnets built into magnetic circuit or excitation windings supplied by DC current.
</p>
<p>In both cases, the rotor flux FR has the course and direction determined by the rotor
</p>
<p>position. The flux vector FR rotates at the rotor speed Om. With Om &frac14; Oe, both the
stator flux vector FS and the rotor flux vector FR revolve at the same speed. They
</p>
<p>do not change their relative position and maintain the angle between the two vectors
</p>
<p>constant. The torque and power of electromechanical conversion are dependent on
</p>
<p>522 18 Synchronous Machines</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-0400-2_14">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-0400-2_14</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the vector product of the two flux vectors. The vector product depends on the angle
</p>
<p>between the two vectors. With Om &frac14; Oe, the two flux vectors do not change their
relative position. The electromagnetic torque is proportional to the product of the
</p>
<p>two flux amplitudes and to the sine of the angle between the two flux vectors. With
</p>
<p>constant flux amplitudes and constant relative position between the two flux
</p>
<p>vectors, the electromagnetic torque remains constant. The operation of synchronous
</p>
<p>machines and the torque development require synchronous rotation (Om &frac14; Oe) of
the stator field, created by the stator currents, and the rotor field, created by
</p>
<p>excitation winding or permanent magnets.
</p>
<p>18.2 Stator Windings
</p>
<p>Stator of a synchronous machine is very much the same as the stator of an induction
</p>
<p>machine. Current circuits on the stator side have three separate parts called stator
</p>
<p>phase windings or stator phases. Each phase is obtained by connecting a number of
</p>
<p>turns in series. Relevant conductors are distributed along the machine circumfer-
</p>
<p>ence and placed into slots. The stator slots are carved into the inner side of the stator
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit, facing the air gap. Distribution of stator conductors along the
</p>
<p>machine circumference is quasisinusoidal. That is, an attempt is made to achieve
</p>
<p>sinusoidal change of the conductor density along the circumference. Ideal sinusoi-
</p>
<p>dal distribution cannot be achieved due to a finite number of slots. Conductors
</p>
<p>cannot be placed in an arbitrary position. They have to be placed in one of the slots.
</p>
<p>Hence, there are a limited number of discrete locations for the placement of stator
</p>
<p>conductors. For this reason, sinusoidal distribution of stator conductors along the
</p>
<p>machine circumference cannot be achieved in full. Yet, the windings are made in
</p>
<p>such way that the distribution of conductors gets as close to sinusoidal as possible.
</p>
<p>Each of the three-phase windings has two terminals. One end of each phase winding
</p>
<p>is connected to the three-phase voltage source which supplies the stator windings.
</p>
<p>Stator terminals of synchronous generators may be connected to three-phase elec-
</p>
<p>trical loads. Remaining ends of the three-phase windings are wired together into the
</p>
<p>node called star point. This way of connecting the stator phases is called star
</p>
<p>connection. With the sum of the three-phase currents equal to zero, ia(t) &thorn; ib(t) &thorn;
ic(t) &frac14; 0, there is no need to connect the star point to the source; thus, no return line
is required. Most machines1 have their star points disconnected from the power
</p>
<p>1Electrical machines supplied the mains with line voltages U &lt; 1 kV are also called low-voltage
machines. Most low-voltage machines have star connected stator windings with floating star point.
</p>
<p>Namely, the star connection of the three phases is not connected to any other node. In most cases,
</p>
<p>the star point is even inaccessible, namely, it is not made available to the user. Machines with
</p>
<p>stator voltages in excess to 1 kV may have their star point connected to the neutral or to the ground
</p>
<p>by means of a series impedance. This connection reduces the overvoltage stress. In most cases, the
</p>
<p>impedance used for grounding the star point has a minor effect on the equation ia &thorn; ib &thorn; ic &frac14; 0.
</p>

<p>supply (floating). In some cases, the three phases of the stator winding are
</p>
<p>connected in triangle, and this way of connecting the phase windings is called
</p>
<p>delta connection. There is no star point in a delta connection.
</p>
<p>Each phase winding creates magnetomotive force which is determined by the
</p>
<p>number of turns of the phase winding and by the electrical current of the phase
</p>
<p>winding. Each phase winding with AC currents creates variable magnetomotive
</p>
<p>force. Currents ia, ib и ic in individual phases of the stator winding create
</p>
<p>magnetomotive forces Fa, Fb, and Fc. Corresponding magnetomotive force vectors
</p>
<p>are positioned along magnetic axis of each phase winding. Magnetic axes of the
</p>
<p>phases that make a two-pole winding system are displaced by 2p/3. Resulting stator
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force FS is obtained by vector summation of the three
</p>
<p>magnetomotive forces, Fa, Fb, and Fc, created by the three-phase windings.
</p>
<p>18.3 Revolving Field
</p>
<p>Magnetic axes of the stator phases as well as magnetomotive forces Fa, Fb, and Fc
are displaced in space by 2p/(3p), where p is the number of pairs of magnetic poles.
</p>
<p>The stator winding can be arranged so as to produce magnetic field with more than
</p>
<p>two magnetic poles. Example of four-pole stator winding has been explained in
</p>
<p>Chap. 17.
</p>
<p>Revolving magnetic field with two magnetic poles is established by AC currents
</p>
<p>in two-pole stator windings. With phase currents of the same amplitude Im and
</p>
<p>frequency oe, and with their initial phases displaced by 2p/3, a two-pole stator
</p>
<p>winding creates two-pole stator field which revolves at the speed Oe &frac14; oe/p &frac14; oe,
also called synchronous speed. With stator windings that create magnetic field with
</p>
<p>more than one pair of magnetic poles (p &gt; 1), the stator field revolves at the speed
Oe &frac14; oe/p.
</p>
<p>Magnetomotive forces of the three-phase windings are given in (Fig. 18.1),
</p>
<p>assuming that the currents have the same amplitude Im, the same angular frequency
</p>
<p>oe, and the initial phases mutually shifted by 2p/3. It is assumed that each phase
</p>
<p>winding has NS turns:

<p>and spatial orientation of the magnetomotive force created by three-phase stator
</p>
<p>windings is explained in Chap. 15. Considering (18.1), magnetic field revolves at
</p>
<p>the speed Oe &frac14; oe/p and maintains a constant amplitude.
Initial phase of stator currents determines the spatial orientation of the stator
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force FS at instant t &frac14; 0. At steady state, the vector FS in synchro-
nous machines has to revolve in synchronism with the rotor. The torque depends on
</p>
<p>the sine of the angle between the rotor flux vector and the vector FS of the stator
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force. When the stator field FS/Rm revolves in synchronism with the
</p>

<p>displaced by 2p/3. Amplitudes of magnetomotive forces Fa, Fb и Fc are determined
</p>
<p>by the phase currents ia(t), ib(t) и ic(t), and by the number of turns NS in each phase
</p>
<p>winding. The resultant magnetomotive force FS is the vector sum of
</p>
<p>magnetomotive forces of individual phases. The quotient FS/Rm of the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force and magnetic resistance Rm gives the vector of the stator
</p>
<p>flux FS. The flux F is the surface integral of the magnetic inductance B, and it
</p>
<p>represents the flux in one stator turn. The stator flux FS is the vector sum of flux
</p>
<p>vectors Fa/Rm, Fb/Rm, and Fc/Rm.
</p>
<p>The winding fluxC represents the flux of all the turns of the winding. It depends
</p>
<p>on the number of turns N. In cases where the winding is concentrated, all conductors
</p>
<p>of the winding are placed in two diametrical slots. Then, the winding flux C is the
</p>
<p>product of the flux F in one turn and the number of turns, C &frac14; NF.
In most cases, the stator conductors are distributed along the air gap circumfer-
</p>
<p>ence with a quasisinusoidal line density of conductors. Therefore, not all the turns
</p>
<p>of the phase winding are in the same place, and they do not have the same flux. The
</p>
<p>flux in individual turns depends on the position, and it is expressed as FS(y), where
</p>
<p>the angle y represents the position of the turn. The winding flux cannot be obtained
</p>
<p>by multiplying the flux in one turn by the number of turns. Instead, it has to be
</p>
<p>calculated by integration, as explained in introductory chapters. For the phase
</p>
<p>winding with quasisinusoidal distribution of conductors, with NS turns, and with
</p>
<p>the maximum value of the flux in one turn equal to Fm, the winding flux is
</p>
<p>determined by C &frac14; (p/4)NSFSm.
The stator flux revolves at the speed Oe, which is determined by the angular
</p>
<p>frequency of the stator phase currents. One part of the stator flux encircles the stator
</p>
<p>conductors, but it does not pass through the air gap and does not reach the rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit. This component of the flux is called leakage flux, and it has the
</p>
<p>same nature as the leakage flux described in chapters discussing induction machines.
</p>
<p>The remaining part of the stator flux passes through the air gap and reaches the rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit. This component is called mutual flux or air gap flux. Along with
</p>
<p>the contribution from the rotor, it makes up the total air gap flux of the machine.
</p>
<p>The electromagnetic torque is created by joint action of the stator and rotor flux
</p>
<p>vectors. Rotor of synchronous machine may have permanent magnets which create
</p>
<p>the rotor flux. There are also synchronous machines with an excitation winding on
</p>
<p>the rotor. DC currents in excitation winding create the rotor magnetomotive force
</p>
<p>and the rotor flux.
</p>
<p>The flux of the stator winding system comprising three-phase windings is
</p>
<p>defined in (18.2), where Rm is magnetic resistance and NS is the number of turns
</p>
<p>per phase. The stator flux vector is denoted by CS. It is obtained by dividing the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force FS by magnetic resistance, and it is shown in Fig. 18.3. The
</p>
<p>flux linkages of individual phases are denoted by Ca, Cb, and Cc, and they depend
</p>
<p>on the amplitude of the flux vector CS and its relative position with respect to
</p>

<p>18.4 Torque Generation
</p>
<p>With permanent magnets built into the rotor magnetic circuit, the rotor generates
</p>
<p>the flux which moves along with the rotor. The same way, the rotor with an
</p>
<p>excitation winding creates the rotor magnetomotive force and the rotor flux
</p>
<p>which moves with the rotor. Hence, the rotor flux vector has the position which is
</p>
<p>equal to position of the rotor. At the same time, the stator currents create the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force FS and the stator flux FS. For both stator and rotor flux
</p>
<p>vectors, corresponding magnetic poles are identified as the regions where the
</p>
<p>lines of magnetic field enter or exit the iron parts of magnetic circuit. Regarding
</p>
<p>the stator flux, position of corresponding magnetic poles is defined by direction of
</p>
<p>the revolving magnetomotive force FS, created by the stator currents. Magnetic
</p>
<p>poles of the rotor flux are defined by the rotor position. Electromagnetic forces tend
</p>
<p>to bring the opposite stator and rotor magnetic poles in close vicinity (Fig. 5.3).
</p>
<p>When the stator field rotates in such way that the north stator pole leads and remains
</p>
<p>ahead of the south rotor pole, there is a constant electromagnetic torque which tends
</p>
<p>to increase the rotor speed. Considering vectors shown in Fig. 18.4, the torque acts
</p>
<p>toward bringing the rotor flux CR closer to the vector FS. The torque can be
</p>
<p>expressed as the vector product between the stator magnetomotive force and the
</p>
<p>rotor flux:
</p>
<p>~Tem &frac14; kt~CR � ~FS:
</p>
<p>Developing constant torque and performing continuous electromechanical
</p>
<p>conversion require that relative position of the stator and rotor vectors remains
</p>
<p>unchanged. This condition is met when the rotor revolves at synchronous speed Oe,
</p>
<p>which is the angular speed of the stator field FS.

<p>Dividing the vector FS by the number of turns NS, one obtains the vector with
</p>
<p>course and direction of FS, and with the amplitude equal to the stator current. In
</p>
<p>further considerations, the vector FS/NS is called stator current vector. The torque
</p>
<p>can be expressed as the vector product of the rotor flux FR and the vector of
</p>
<p>the stator current, Tem &frac14; ktNS FR�iS &frac14; ktNS jFRjjiSj sin(x), where x denotes the
angle between the rotor flux vector and the stator current vector, while jiSj denotes
the amplitude of the stator current.

<p>values (jiSj, x). The amplitude of the stator current required to obtain desired torque
is lower when sin(x) is higher, and it reaches the minimum in cases where the
</p>
<p>relevant vectors are orthogonal. With x &frac14; �p/2 and with the smallest possible jiSj,
corresponding copper losses in the stator winding reach their minimum. Condition
</p>
<p>x &frac14; �p/2 provides the possibility to obtain the maximum torque for the given
current amplitude jiSj. In other words, it maximizes the torque-per-Ampere ratio
Tem/jiSj.
</p>
<p>In order to maximize the torque-per-Ampere ratio in synchronous machines, it is
</p>
<p>necessary to establish the phase currents ia, ib, and ic so as to obtain the stator

<p>magnetomotive force vector FS which is perpendicular to the rotor flux. Hence,
</p>
<p>whatever the rotor speed or position, the vector FS is to be locked to the rotor
</p>
<p>position, advancing with respect to the rotor flux by p/2. In such cases, the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque is determined by the amplitude of the stator current, Tem &frac14;

<p>permanent magnet synchronous machines used in motion control applications.
</p>
<p>These synchronous machines are also called synchronous servomotors, and they
</p>
<p>are distinguished by low inertia of the rotor and high ratio of the peak torque and the
</p>
<p>rated torque. In motion control applications, each synchronous servomotor is
</p>
<p>supplied from a separate three-phase inverter which supplies the motors with the

<p>phase currents required for generating the set torque. By using the current regulator
</p>
<p>with pulse width modulation control, the stator voltages are adjusted so as to obtain

<p>Question (18.1): Consider two induction machines with short-circuited rotor cage
and with the same dimensions of stator and rotor magnetic circuits. One of these is a
</p>
<p>two-pole induction machine while the other is a four-pole machine. The rotors of
</p>
<p>both machines are taken out of their stators. A new machine is made by inserting the
</p>
<p>rotor of the second machine into the stator of the first machine. Is it possible for the
</p>
<p>new machine to develop any torque?
</p>
<p>Answer (18.1): The torque development is based on interaction of the stator and
rotor magnetic fields. In order to obtain the electromagnetic torque, it is necessary
</p>
<p>that the rotor and stator fields have the same number of magnetic poles. Magnetic
</p>
<p>field of the stator of an induction machine is created by magnetomotive forces
</p>
<p>caused by electrical currents in the stator windings. The stator windings of the first
</p>
<p>machine generate a two-pole magnetic field, while the stator windings of the second
</p>
<p>machine create a four-pole magnetic field. The latter has two north magnetic poles
</p>
<p>and two south magnetic poles. In both machines, magnetic field of the rotor depends
</p>
<p>on the currents induced in the rotor conductors. The rotor currents appear as a
</p>
<p>consequence of electromotive forces induced in the rotor cage. Electromotive
</p>
<p>forces depend on magnetic induction in the air gap, and they also depend on the
</p>
<p>slip speed. The change in amplitude and direction of the rotor electromotive forces
</p>
<p>and currents reflects the change of the air gap inductance B. Therefore, the number
</p>
<p>of magnetic poles of consequential rotor flux is the same as the number of poles of
</p>
<p>the stator magnetic field. Hence, one and the same rotor creates a two-pole field
</p>
<p>while operating within a two-pole stator and a four-pole field when operating in a
</p>
<p>four-pole stator. Therefore, the machine made by combining the stator of the first
</p>
<p>machine with the rotor of the second machine will be capable of running as a proper
</p>
<p>induction machine, and it will develop the torque.
</p>
<p>Question (18.2): Consider two synchronous machines, each with permanent
magnet rotor. Bothmachines have equal dimensions of their rotor and statormagnetic
</p>
<p>18.4 Torque Generation 529</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>circuits. The first machine is a two-pole machine while the second is a four-pole
</p>
<p>machine. A new machine is made by inserting the rotor of the second machine into
</p>
<p>the stator of the firstmachine.Would this newmachine be able to develop any torque?
</p>
<p>Answer (18.2): Unlike induction machines, synchronous machines have the rotor
flux created by an excitation winding on the rotor or by permanent magnets build
</p>
<p>into the rotor magnetic circuit. With permanent magnet excitation, the number of
</p>
<p>magnetic poles depends on configuration of the permanent magnets. With an
</p>
<p>excitation winding, the excitation current is not induced from the stator side.
</p>
<p>Instead, it is provided from a separate source of DC current. The way of making
</p>
<p>the excitation winding determines the number of magnetic poles of the rotor field.
</p>
<p>Hence, with both permanent magnet excitation and with excitation winding, the
</p>
<p>number of magnetic poles of the rotor field of synchronous machines depends on
</p>
<p>the rotor design. In other words, the number of magnetic poles of the rotor field does
</p>
<p>not depend on the number of poles of the stator field, which was the case with
</p>
<p>induction machines. Synchronous machine operates properly and develops electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic torque only in the case when the stator and rotor have the same number of
</p>
<p>magnetic poles. A combination of a two-pole stator with a four-pole rotor would not
</p>
<p>develop any electromagnetic torque.
</p>
<p>18.5 Construction of Synchronous Machines
</p>
<p>Synchronous machines have stator with three-phase windings and rotor with either
</p>
<p>excitationwinding orwith permanentmagnets. The stator terminals are connected to a
</p>
<p>symmetrical system of three-phase voltages and currents. The stator currents create
</p>
<p>revolving magnetic field in the air gap of the machine. For the proper operation of
</p>
<p>synchronous machine, the stator field has to revolve at the same speed as the rotor.
</p>
<p>Electromagnetic torque is created from interaction of the two magnetic fields. Syn-
</p>
<p>chronousmachines can bemade in the formof discs or cylinders; they can have hollow
</p>
<p>rotor, and there are also linear synchronous machines which perform translation rather
</p>
<p>than rotation. Synchronous machines are mostly cylindrical machines (Fig. 18.5).
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.5 Stator magnetic circuit is made by stacking iron sheets
</p>
<p>530 18 Synchronous Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.6 Stator Magnetic Circuit
</p>
<p>Stator of cylindrical synchronousmachines is a hollow cylinder which accommodates
</p>
<p>the rotor. The main parts of the stator are magnetic circuit and current circuits, also
</p>
<p>called phase windings. Magnetic circuit is made of ferromagnetic materials, usually
</p>
<p>iron alloys, while the current circuits consist of insulated copper conductors.
</p>
<p>Stator of synchronous machines is entirely the same as the stator of an induction
</p>
<p>machine. Magnetic induction B in the stator magnetic circuit changes due to
</p>
<p>rotation of the magnetic field with respect to the stator core. Induction B varies
</p>
<p>with the frequency oe, which is the angular frequency of the stator currents.
</p>
<p>Variation of magnetic induction causes eddy current losses and hysteresis losses
</p>
<p>in conductive ferromagnetics. The losses due to eddy currents are proportional to
</p>
<p>the square of the frequency, while the losses due to hysteresis are proportional to the
</p>
<p>frequency. In synchronous machines supplied from the mains, magnetic induction
</p>
<p>in the stator magnetic circuit pulsates at the frequency of fe &frac14; 50 Hz (60 Hz). In
order to reduce losses in the stator magnetic circuit, it is made by stacking the iron
</p>
<p>sheets. The sheets are separated by a thin layer of electric insulation.
</p>
<p>The iron sheets are actually made of iron alloys comprising small quantities of
</p>
<p>manganese and other elements. Lamination of magnetic circuit does not reduce the
</p>
<p>hysteresis losses, but it suppresses the eddy currents and reduces the overall iron
</p>
<p>losses in magnetic circuit caused by the pulsation of magnetic induction. Since the
</p>
<p>magnetic field revolves with respect to the stator, magnetic induction in stator
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit changes direction. For this reason, it is essential for the iron sheets
</p>
<p>to have the samemagnetic properties in all directions. Such sheets are obtained by hot
</p>
<p>rolling of steel, and they are called hot rolled sheets. On the other hand, magnetic
</p>
<p>circuits used in power transformers have the field which is always directed along the
</p>
<p>same path. Therefore, it is important to have improved magnetic properties along the
</p>
<p>flux path, while the properties in directions perpendicular to the path are of lesser
</p>
<p>importance. In such cases, it is beneficial to use anisotropic2 material, optimized to
</p>
<p>provide a lowmagnetic resistance along the flux path. The sheets with such properties
</p>
<p>are obtained by cold rolling. Hence, the iron sheets used in power transformers
</p>
<p>are cold rolled sheets. Cold rolling results in reducedmagnetic resistance in direction
</p>
<p>of rolling, which should correspond to the flux path within power transformer.
</p>
<p>By stacking the sheets, one obtains a hollow cylinder with slots on the inner
</p>
<p>surface which faces the air gap. The slots are intended for placing conductors of the
</p>
<p>stator winding. Parts of the stator magnetic circuit between the slots are called teeth.
</p>
<p>The flux passing toward the air gap is directed through the teeth, made of iron of
</p>
<p>high-permeability and low magnetic resistance. The flux does not pass through the
</p>
<p>slots, where permeability is m0 and where magnetic resistance is high. Therefore,
</p>
<p>magnetic induction inside teeth is higher compared to the rest of the stator magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit, which results in increased teeth iron losses.
</p>
<p>2Anisotropic &ndash; having different properties in different directions. For example, anisotropic
</p>
<p>ferromagnetic may have different permeability in direction of axes x, y, and z.

<p>18.7 Construction of the Rotor
</p>
<p>The rotor of synchronousmachineswith permanentmagnets built intomagnetic circuit
</p>
<p>is shown in the part (A) of Fig. 18.6. Permanent magnets are ferromagnetic materials
</p>
<p>capable of providing the rotor flux without an excitation winding. Magnetizing char-
</p>
<p>acteristic B(H) of permanent magnets has a relatively high remanent induction Br. In
</p>
<p>absence of rotor windings, there is no rotor magnetomotive force F &frac14; NI; thus, there
are no external means to create and control the rotor flux but the permanent magnets.
</p>
<p>With sufficient remanent induction of permanent magnets, it is possible to achieve
</p>
<p>significant values of the rotor flux. By inserting permanent magnets into the rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit, the rotor flux is obtained in a lossless manner, without a need of
</p>
<p>making the rotor windings. This simplifies the machine construction, reduces the
</p>
<p>losses, and increases efficiency. One shortcoming of this solution is the lack of
</p>
<p>possibility to change the rotor flux. Without the flux control, the field-weakening
</p>
<p>operation of permanent magnet synchronous machines is virtually impossible.
</p>
<p>The part (b) of Fig. 18.6 shows the rotor with electromagnetic excitation. This rotor
</p>
<p>has an excitation winding with NR turns carrying DC current iR. The magnetomotive
</p>
<p>force of the excitation winding FR &frac14; NRiR determines the excitation fluxFR &frac14; NRiR/
Rm and the flux of the excitation windingCR &frac14; NRFR &frac14; (NR2/Rm)iR &frac14; LRiR. There is
a small amount of the rotor flux which encircles the excitation winding, but it does not

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>pass through the air gap and does not reach the stator magnetic circuit and the stator
</p>
<p>windings. This flux is called excitation leakage flux. Major part of the excitation flux
</p>
<p>encircles both the rotor and statorwinding; it contributes to themutual fluxCm and it is
</p>
<p>denoted by CmR. This flux is the bases for the process of electromechanical energy
</p>
<p>conversion and for creation of the electromagnetic torque.
</p>
<p>Magnetic core of the rotor with excitation winding may have salient poles, and
</p>
<p>one such case is shown in Fig. 18.6c. Salient pole rotors have a small air gap and a
</p>
<p>low magnetic resistance along the path of the excitation flux, while the air gap in
</p>
<p>direction perpendicular to the flux is larger, causing a larger magnetic resistance.
</p>
<p>Commonly used symbol that represents the rotor in figures and diagrams is
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 18.6d. Although it resembles a salient pole rotor, it is also used as a
</p>
<p>simplified representation of cylindrical rotors, such as the one in Fig. 18.6b, which
</p>
<p>have the same air gap and the same magnetic resistance along the circumference.
</p>
<p>Advantage of electromagnetic excitation over permanent magnet excitation is
</p>
<p>that the latter allows variation of the excitation flux by varying the excitation
</p>
<p>current iR. Shortcomings of this solution are increased losses and more complex
</p>
<p>construction of the machine, owing to the need to feed DC current iR to the winding
</p>
<p>which is mounted on the rotor. The excitation voltage uR supplied to the terminals
</p>
<p>of the excitation winding needs to be wired to an external DC source. This source is
</p>
<p>placed on the stator side, the side that does not move, while the excitation winding
</p>
<p>resides on the rotor which revolves with respect to the stator. This brings up the
</p>
<p>problem of passing the excitation current to the moving part of the machine (Fig. 18.7).
</p>
<p>18.8 Supplying the Excitation Winding
</p>
<p>Supplying the excitation winding can be performed by means of the slip rings
</p>
<p>fastened to the rotor shaft. The two terminals of the excitation winding can be wired
</p>
<p>to a pair of slip rings, both of them with mutual electrical insulation and insulated
</p>
<p>from the shaft. Two conductive brushes can be fastened to the stator and pressed
</p>
<p>against respective slip ring, providing in this way an electrical access to the
</p>
<p>excitation winding. While the rotor is in motion, the brushes slide against
</p>

<p>18.8 Supplying the Excitation Winding 533</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the rings and maintain electrical contact. DC current fed to the brushes passes to the
</p>
<p>slip rings and gets to the terminals of the excitation winding. Prescribed method of
</p>
<p>supplying the excitation winding from the stator side passes the DC current from an
</p>
<p>external source to the excitation winding. It works both with the rotor in motion and
</p>
<p>with the rotor at standstill. By changing the excitation voltage, the excitation
</p>
<p>current can be adjusted so as to provide the rotor flux that corresponds to desired
</p>
<p>operating mode of the machine.
</p>
<p>Large hydrogenerators that operate in hydroelectric power plants as well as
</p>
<p>turbogenerators that operate in thermal power plants have electromagnetic excita-
</p>
<p>tion that includes the excitation winding on the rotor. Electrical current in excitation
</p>
<p>winding is adjusted so as to obtain desired voltage across the stator terminals.
</p>
<p>The stator electromotive force determines the stator voltage. At the same time, the
</p>
<p>electromotive force is proportional to the rotor flux. Hence, the stator voltage of
</p>
<p>synchronous generators can be increased or decreased by changing the excitation
</p>
<p>current. Variation of generator voltages is required in order to compensate for
</p>
<p>variable voltage drops between the power plants and electrical consumers. As the
</p>
<p>consumption of electrical power at the consumer side increases, the generator load
</p>
<p>increases as well as the stator current. An increased current produces larger voltage
</p>
<p>drops in transmission lines, power transformers, and distribution cables. In order to
</p>
<p>keep the consumer voltages constant, it is necessary to increase the voltage of
</p>
<p>synchronous generators. This increase is required to compensate for the increased
</p>
<p>voltage drops in transmission and distribution. The goal is achieved by increasing
</p>
<p>the excitation current of synchronous generators.
</p>
<p>One shortcoming of the excitation system with slip rings is that the excitation
</p>
<p>current passes through the contact between the brushes and slip rings. The rotormotion
</p>
<p>makes the contact surfaces slide against each other. With unsteady electrical contact,
</p>
<p>electric arcmay app7ear in the course of rotation. Sporadic arcing presents the fire risk
</p>
<p>and increases electromagnetic interference. Besides, arcing and friction contribute to
</p>
<p>ware of the sliding rings and brushes. This in turn requires repairs and maintenance.
</p>
<p>Besides, the presence of slip rings increases the axial length of the machine.
</p>
<p>18.9 Excitation with Rotating Transformer
</p>
<p>The transfer of the excitation power to the rotor without mechanical contact can be
</p>
<p>accomplished by using a rotating transformer, the principles of which are depicted
</p>
<p>in Fig. 18.8. Primary winding of this transformer is on the stator side of the
</p>
<p>machine, along with one half of the transformer magnetic circuit. Both transformer
</p>
<p>parts are attached to the stator and do not move. The stator side of the
</p>
<p>transformer magnetic circuit has the shape of a ring. Along the circumference, a
</p>
<p>slot is carved into the inner surface of the ring, and the primary winding is placed
</p>
<p>into this slot. The other part of the transformer magnetic circuit is attached to the
</p>
<p>rotor shaft, and it moves with the rotor. It has the shape of a ring of a smaller
</p>
<p>diameter so that it fits into the stator part of the transformer magnetic circuit. A slot
</p>
<p>534 18 Synchronous Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>is carved into the outer side of this ring, and it houses the secondary winding of the
</p>
<p>rotating transformer. It is observed in Fig. 18.8 that conductors of primary and
</p>
<p>secondary windings of the rotating transformer have tangential direction. Namely,
</p>
<p>they are wound around the shaft. The circumstance that one part of the magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit rotates with respect to the other part does not preclude establishing the
</p>
<p>mutual flux of the transformer. This flux couples the primary and secondary
</p>
<p>windings and provides for customary transformer function of passing the electrical
</p>
<p>energy from the primary to the secondary side. The field lines that represent the
</p>
<p>mutual flux are shown in Fig. 18.8.
</p>
<p>Primary winding of the rotating transformer is supplied by an external source of
</p>
<p>AC current with the frequency ranging from several hundred Hz to several kHz.
</p>
<p>Due to magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary windings, the AC
</p>
<p>currents are transferred from the primary to the secondary side of the transformer.
</p>
<p>In this way, the secondary winding provides the source of AC currents that are made
</p>
<p>available at the rotor side of the machine. In order to supply the excitation winding
</p>

side. (b) Secondary winding. (c) Primary winding. (d) Terminals of the primary fed from the stator

<p>18.9 Excitation with Rotating Transformer 535</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>with DC currents, the rotor has a diode bridge. This bridge rectifies AC currents of
</p>
<p>the secondary winding and obtains DC current which is fed to the excitation
</p>
<p>winding. The excitation current can be varied by changing the amplitude of the
</p>
<p>primary AC current. Described excitation system uses a contactless transfer of the
</p>
<p>excitation power to the rotor. It does not involve any friction or mechanical ware.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it offers high reliability and low maintenance. When applying a rotating
</p>
<p>transformer with a diode rectifier built into the rotor, the rotor temperature has to be
</p>
<p>limited to 125&ndash;150�C so as to avoid damage to semiconductor diodes.
</p>
<p>18.10 Permanent Magnet Excitation
</p>
<p>By inserting permanent magnets into the rotor magnetic circuit, synchronous
</p>
<p>machine obtains the rotor flux without any excitation winding and with no rotor
</p>
<p>currents. In rare cases, the whole rotor is made of permanent magnets. In majority
</p>
<p>of cases, only one part of the rotor volume is filled with permanent magnet materials
</p>
<p>while the remaining, larger part of the rotor magnetic circuit is made of ferromag-
</p>
<p>netic materials such as iron sheets. The quantity of magnets is determined so as to
</p>
<p>produce sufficient rotor flux for the operation of the machine. The iron part of the
</p>
<p>rotor has dedicated holes for the insertion of magnet modules (Fig. 18.9).
</p>
<p>During regular operation of synchronousmachine, the rotor revolves in synchronism
</p>
<p>with the stator field. Therefore, there is no variation of magnetic induction in the rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit and no iron losses.3 In absence of rotor windings and absence of iron
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.9 (a) Rotor with interior magnets. (b) Surface-mounted magnets
</p>
<p>3 In synchronous motors supplied from three-phase inverters with pulse width modulation, there is
</p>
<p>a certain current ripple, a high-frequency component of the stator current with an amplitude of
</p>
<p>0.02 . . . 0.03 In and with the frequency which is equal to the switching frequency of power
</p>
<p>transistors. Due to this nonsinusoidal supply, there are some small, high-frequency variations of
</p>
<p>the magnetic induction within the rotor circuit, notwithstanding the fact that the fundamental flux
</p>
<p>component revolves in synchronism with the rotor.
</p>
<p>536 18 Synchronous Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>losses in rotor magnetic circuit, there is no heat generated within the rotor. As a
</p>
<p>consequence, there is no need to devise any particular measures for cooling of the
</p>
<p>rotor. Without the rotor heat, cooling of the stator winding and the stator magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit is easier to achieve in synchronousmachines than in inductionmachines. For this
</p>
<p>reason, there is a certainmargin to increase the current and fluxdensities in synchronous
</p>
<p>machine. With increased current density and increased magnetic induction, synchro-
</p>
<p>nous machines can deliver more torque and more power from the same volume.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, for the given torque and given power, synchronous machines can be
</p>
<p>designedwith lower size and lower weight than equivalent inductionmachines. Hence,
</p>
<p>specific torque4 and specific power of synchronous permanent magnet machines are
</p>
<p>higher compared to induction machines.
</p>
<p>The problem of synchronous machines with permanent magnets is the absence
</p>
<p>of possibility of changing the rotor flux. For this reason, permanent magnet
</p>
<p>machines have difficulties operating in field-weakening mode. Permanent magnets
</p>
<p>can be built on the surface of the rotor magnetic circuit (surface mount) or within
</p>
<p>the interior part of the magnetic circuit (interior magnet or buried magnet). The way
</p>
<p>of inserting the magnets has significant impact on the machine parameters and
</p>
<p>characteristics. It mostly affects the stator inductance LS. The winding inductance is
</p>
<p>inversely proportional to the magnetic resistance, and the latter is greatly affected
</p>
<p>by the method of inserting the magnets. In synchronous machines with interior
</p>
<p>magnets, magnetic resistance is relatively small. The winding inductance has
</p>
<p>relative value that ranges from 0.1 up to 0.5. In machines with surface mount
</p>
<p>magnets, relative value of the winding inductance ranges from 0.01 up to 0.1.
</p>
<p>Synchronous machines with permanent magnets have virtually no rotor losses,
</p>
<p>and their efficiency is higher compared to other kinds of electrical machines.
</p>
<p>Comparing the power balance of permanently excited synchronous machines to
</p>
<p>the power balance of induction machines, it has to be noted that the synchronous
</p>
<p>machine does not have the rotor losses sPd. With the rotor revolving at synchronous
</p>
<p>speed, relative slip s of synchronous machines is equal to zero. The absence of rotor
</p>
<p>losses contributes to a significant increase in the efficiency of synchronous
</p>
<p>machines.
</p>
<p>Question (18.3): Efficiency of a two-pole induction motor running at the rated
speed of nn &frac14; 2,850 rpm is 90%. It is known that the iron losses are relatively small
compared to copper losses. Make an estimate of efficiency of a permanent magnet
</p>
<p>synchronous motor of the same rated speed, same power, voltage, current, and
</p>
<p>dimensions.
</p>
<p>Answer (18.3): Based on the problem formulation, the iron losses can be
neglected in both machines. Mechanical losses are relatively small and similar in
</p>
<p>both cases. Therefore, they can be neglected in making an estimate of the effi-
</p>
<p>ciency. Required estimate should be made considering copper losses alone.
</p>
<p>4 Specific torque is the ratio Tem/m, the quotient of the torque, and mass of the machine. Alterna-
</p>
<p>tively, specific torque can be defined as Tem/V, the quotient of the torque and volume.
</p>
<p>18.10 Permanent Magnet Excitation 537</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In synchronous machines, there are copper losses in the stator winding only.
</p>
<p>Compared to synchronous machines, induction machines have the rotor losses as
</p>
<p>well, and their amount is sPd &frac14; PCu2. The stator and rotor currents in induction
machines have approximately the same amplitude. At the same time, the cross
</p>
<p>section of the stator and rotor slots is also similar, as well as the current density.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the copper losses in stator are comparable
</p>
<p>to the copper losses in rotor of induction machines. The rotor losses snPdn are close
</p>
<p>to (3,000&ndash;2,850)/3,000 &frac14; 5% of the rated power. Hence, a rough estimate of the
stator losses of synchronous machine is 5%. Efficiency of an equivalent synchro-
</p>
<p>nous machine is close to 95%.

<p>18.11 Characteristics of Permanent Magnets
</p>
<p>Magnetizing characteristic of permanent magnet material is shown in Fig. 18.10.
</p>
<p>The abscissa represents the external field H, that is, the field brought into the
</p>
<p>considered domain by means of the factors outside the magnet. In most cases,
</p>
<p>external field is created by electrical currents in coils or windings placed in close
</p>
<p>vicinity of the magnet. Remanent induction BR exists with no external field, with
</p>
<p>H &frac14; 0, and it may exceed 1 T. Smaller values of remanent induction such as 0.3 T
are encountered with ferrite magnets. Majority of ferromagnetic materials such as
</p>
<p>iron have a small level of remanent inductance, which appears due to tendency of
</p>
<p>oriented magnetic dipoles to retain their direction after removing the external field
</p>
<p>(Fig. 18.11). A certain remanent induction exists even in iron sheets which are used
</p>
<p>in making magnetic circuits of electrical machines. This value has rather small
</p>
<p>remanent induction of BR &lt; 50 mT, which is readily reduced to zero by an external
magnetic field H of opposite direction or by exposing magnetic material to elevated
</p>
<p>temperatures.
</p>
<p>Relation between the magnetic induction within permanent magnet and the
</p>
<p>external field H is given in Fig. 18.10. By introducing an external magnetic field
</p>
<p>H of moderate intensity (H &gt; -Hc/2) and direction opposite to remanent induction,
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.10 Magnetizing characteristic of permanent magnet
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the operating point moves from (0, BR) toward the left, which results in some
</p>
<p>decrease of magnetic induction. Upon removing demagnetizing field H, the
</p>
<p>operating point returns to the initial position, to the point (0, BR) in Fig. 18.10.
</p>
<p>In cases where the external field H reaches the value of coercitive field �Hc,
magnetic induction drops to zero. This may cause permanent damage to the magnet.
</p>
<p>Namely, starting from the point (�Hc, 0) and removing the field �Hc does not
necessarily bring the operating point back to (0, BR). Instead, the operating point
</p>
<p>may return to the point (0, BR1) with much lower remanent induction BR1 &lt; BR. In
such cases, the original remanent induction cannot be restored, and the damage to
</p>
<p>the magnet remains permanent. The remanent induction can be reduced by a factor
</p>
<p>of two or three. Damage to the magnet can be evaluated after removing the
</p>
<p>demagnetizing field H &lt; 0.
In majority of permanent magnet materials, characteristic B(H) has a point of
</p>
<p>inflection in the second quadrant called the knee point, where the external field
</p>
<p>H &lt; 0 makes the magnetic induction reduce at an increased rate. The field strength
at the knee point is approximatelyH &frac14; �Hc/2. In most cases, permanent damage to
the magnet occurs when the operating point passes the knee point and proceeds the
</p>
<p>left, reaching the zones with H &lt; �Hc/2.
Larger values of remanent induction BR have positive impact on characteristics
</p>
<p>of synchronous machines with permanent magnets, since the rotor flux is propor-
</p>
<p>tional to BR and the torque is proportional to the rotor flu. It is also beneficial to have
</p>
<p>a large coercitive field Hc, which delineates the magnet capability to withstand
</p>
<p>demagnetizing field. Quality of permanent magnets is measured by the product
</p>
<p>BRHc, which has dimensions of energy density. Magnets with higher energies have
</p>
<p>larger values of remanent induction and larger values of coercitive fields. They are
</p>
<p>more robust with respect to external fields, that is, they could operate with larger
</p>
<p>demagnetizing fields H without suffering any damage. This property helps the
</p>
<p>operation of permanent magnets built into the rotor magnetic circuit, where they
</p>
<p>get exposed to demagnetizing fields. The stator currents of synchronous machines
</p>
<p>produce considerable magnetomotive forces. These magnetomotive forces produce
</p>

</p>
<p>18.11 Characteristics of Permanent Magnets 539</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>relatively large magnetic field H within permanent magnets. In most cases, direc-
</p>
<p>tion of this field opposes to magnetic induction of the magnet and causes demagne-
</p>
<p>tization. For this reason, it is of interest to select permanent magnets with an
</p>
<p>adequate BRHc product, that is, with an adequate energy. This choice is particularly
</p>
<p>important in synchronous servomotors where the peak torque and the peak stator
</p>
<p>current exceed their rated values by an order of magnitude, causing exceptionally
</p>
<p>large demagnetizing fields.
</p>
<p>In the first quadrant of the B(H) characteristic, all magnetic dipoles inside the
</p>
<p>magnet are already oriented in the direction of the field, and they already make their
</p>
<p>full contribution to magnetic induction. There are no magnetic dipoles that are not
</p>
<p>oriented. Any further increase of the field H cannot find any disoriented magnetic
</p>
<p>dipoles and cannot get them aligned with the field. In such conditions, any
</p>
<p>further increase DB of magnetic induction is equal to m0DH. Therefore, differential
</p>
<p>permeability DB/DH of permanent magnets in the first quadrant is close to m0. In
</p>
<p>other words, the permanent magnet response DB to an external field DH is equal to
</p>
<p>that of the air or vacuum, DB &frac14; m0DH. Considering magnetic resistance to external
field, permanent magnet behaves as the air. Magnetic resistance Rm to an external
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force does not change by inserting permanent magnet into the air-
</p>
<p>filled space, nor does it change by extracting permanent magnet from the magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit.
</p>
<p>18.12 Magnetic Circuits with Permanent Magnets
</p>
<p>It is of interest to analyze magnetic circuits that comprise permanent magnets. As
</p>
<p>an example, magnetic circuit in Fig. 18.12 is studied in order to obtain the values of
</p>
<p>the field H and magnetic induction B in different parts of the circuit. The circuit has
</p>
<p>permanent magnet of the length dPM, an air gap d0, and an iron part of magnetic
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>circuit of permeability mFewhich is very large. Therefore, magnetic fieldHFe in iron
</p>
<p>is neglected.
</p>
<p>Considered structure does not have any windings; thus, Ni &frac14; HPMdPM &thorn;
H0d0 &frac14; 0. All parts of the circuit have the same cross section S. Considering the
flux conservation law FPM&frac14;F0&frac14;FFe, one obtains that BPM &frac14; B0 &frac14; BFe. Since
H0 &frac14; B0/m0 &frac14; BPM/m0, relation between magnetic induction BPM and field HPM is
given by expression BPM &frac14; � m0(dPM/d0) HPM. The intersection of nonlinear
magnetizing characteristic B(H) of permanent magnet material and the line BPM &frac14;
�m0(dPM/d0)HPM gives the operating point of considered magnetic circuit.
Coordinates of this intersection represent the values of magnetic induction and mag-
</p>
<p>netic field within the magnet. In B-H diagram, the intersection is located in the second
</p>
<p>quadrant, where magnetic induction is positive while magnetic field H is negative.
</p>
<p>In cases where magnetic circuit does not contain any air gap, the field HPM &frac14;
BPM(d0/dPM)/m0 inside the magnet is equal to zero, while the magnetic induction is
</p>
<p>equal to remanent induction BR of permanent magnet material. By increasing the air
</p>
<p>gap, the slope of the straight line BPM &frac14; �m0(dPM/d0)HPM decreases. The intersec-
tion with the curve B(H) assumes smaller value of magnetic induction, while the
</p>
<p>field HPM assumes negative value. Hence, when the magnet is placed in magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit with an air gap, magnetic induction BPM and field HPMwithin the magnet are
</p>
<p>of opposite direction.
</p>
<p>18.13 Surface Mount and Buried Magnets
</p>
<p>Permanent magnets can be mounted on the rotor surface or buried within the rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit. Example of permanent magnets mounted on the rotor surface is
</p>
<p>given in Fig. 18.13.
</p>
<p>The lines of magnetic field pass from the stator teeth into the air gap d0; they
</p>
<p>proceed and enter the permanent magnet of thickness dPM and then pass to the iron
</p>
<p>parts of the rotor magnetic circuit. Passing through the rotor core and getting to the
</p>
<p>opposite magnetic pole of the rotor, the field lines return from the rotor into the
</p>
<p>stator passing through the iron parts of the rotor, then through the permanent
</p>
<p>magnet, proceeding through the air gap, and reaching the stator teeth.
</p>
<p>Resultant flux of the stator winding has the component CmR that comes from
</p>
<p>permanent magnets and the component LSiS caused by the stator currents, the latter
</p>
<p>proportional to the stator self-inductance LS. Stator self-inductance LS depends on
</p>
<p>magnetic resistance Rm encountered along the path of the stator flux. Permeability in
</p>
<p>iron is very large (mFe ~ /), making magnetic field HFe in iron parts of magnetic
circuit negligible. Therefore, magnetic resistance on the path of the stator flux
</p>
<p>reduces to the air gap resistance and the resistance of permanent magnets:

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In the first quadrant of B&ndash;H plane, differential permeability of permanent magnet
</p>
<p>materials mPM &frac14; DB/DH is equal to m0. In the presence of the stator magnetomotive
force, behavior of permanent magnets of thickness dPM is the same as behavior of
</p>
<p>an additional air gap dPM. Therefore, the equivalent magnetic gap d is equal to the
</p>
<p>sum of the two,
</p>
<p>d &frac14; d0 &thorn; dPM; (18.4)
</p>
<p>where d0 represents the actual mechanical air gap, that is, the distance between the
</p>
<p>stator and rotor, while dPM represents the thickness of the magnet. For the purposes
</p>
<p>of LS calculation, themagnet can be replaced by an additional air gap of the thickness
</p>
<p>dPM. Thickness of the magnet is many times larger than the air gap. For this reason,

<p>magnetic resistance on the path of the stator flux is significantly larger in synchro-
</p>
<p>nous machines with surface-mounted magnets. Hence, the stator self-inductance LS
is very low. Synchronous machines with surface-mounted magnets have the stator
</p>
<p>inductance of the order 1%. The stator inductance of synchronous machines with
</p>
<p>interior magnets has the values ranging from 10% up to 70%.
</p>
<p>A small inductance LS reduces the reactance of the machine XS &frac14; oeLS.
Synchronous machines are usually supplied from three-phase transistor inverters
</p>
<p>with pulse width modulation, where reduced inductance of the stator winding
</p>
<p>results in an increased current ripple DI. In inverter supplied machines, pulse
</p>
<p>width-modulated pulses of the amplitude E repeat across the stator terminals with
</p>
<p>commutation frequency fPWM &frac14; 1/T � 10&ndash;20 kHz, and they create oscillations of
the stator current around the fundamental component. These oscillations are called
</p>
<p>ripple. The amplitude of current ripple is roughly DI � ET/(4LS). With low stator
inductance LS of synchronous machines with surface-mounted magnets, the ripple
</p>
<p>DI is increased. Therefore, in order to contain the stator current ripple in synchro-
</p>
<p>nous servomotors, it is necessary to increase the commutation frequency of three-
</p>
<p>phase transistor inverters and to operate with fPWM &gt; 10 kHz.
Rather than being mounted on the surface, permanent magnets can be inserted
</p>
<p>into dedicated openings made within inner iron parts of the rotor magnetic circuit
</p>
<p>(Fig. 18.14). These openings can be placed further away from the rotor surface, in
</p>
<p>deeper areas of the rotor core and closer to the shaft. Hence, the magnets are buried
</p>
<p>into the rotor core. With buried magnets, the stator teeth do not face the permanent
</p>
<p>magnets across the air gap. Instead, the stator flux passes from the stator teeth into
</p>
<p>the iron parts of the rotor magnetic circuit. The lines of magnetic field caused by the
</p>
<p>stator currents pass through the air gap and enter the surface parts of the rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit which are made of iron having a very high permeability. Because
</p>
<p>of this, the equivalent magnetic gap d &frac14; d0 &thorn; dPM is equal to the air gap d0, and it
is much smaller than the equivalent magnetic gap with surface-mounted magnets.
</p>
<p>Therefore, magnetic resistance along the stator flux path is considerably smaller,
</p>
<p>and the stator inductance LS is considerably higher. With buried magnets, relative
</p>
<p>value of stator inductance ranges from 10% up to 70%.
</p>
<p>18.14 Characteristics of Permanent Magnet Machines
</p>
<p>Surface-mounted magnets result in a very small stator inductance LS. The rate of
</p>
<p>change of the stator current dia/dt &frac14; (ua�ea)/LS is very high and approaches the
value of dia/dt � 7,000 [In/s],5 allowing a very high rate of change of the electro-
magnetic torque Tem, which depends on the rotor flux and the stator current,
</p>
<p>Tem &frac14; kjCRm � iSj. With surface-mounted magnets, the torque rise time from
zero up to the rated value can be achieved in 100&ndash;200 ms. For this reason,
</p>
<p>5 Starting from zero, the rated current In can be reached in 1/7,000 s.

<p>synchronous motors with surface-mounted magnets are used in motion control
</p>
<p>applications such as the industry automation and robotics, where the closed loop
</p>
<p>speed and position control depend on the ability to effectuate very fast torque
</p>
<p>changes.
</p>
<p>One shortcoming of synchronous machines with surface-mounted magnets is
</p>
<p>their limited ability to operate in the field-weakening region, where the rotor speed
</p>
<p>exceeds the rated speed, increasing as well the electromotive force joeCS induced
</p>
<p>in the stator windings. Above the rated speed, the stator fluxCS has to be reduced in
</p>
<p>order to maintain the electromotive force joeCS within the rated limits, jjoeCSj �
Un &frac14; Cnon. To this aim, the fluxCS &frac14; CRm &thorn; LSiS should be decreased according
to the law CS(oe) &frac14; Cn(on/oe). The flux CRm of permanent magnets cannot
be altered, and the flux reduction requires a demagnetizing component of the stator
</p>
<p>current iS. The amount of demagnetizing stator current depends on the
</p>
<p>stator inductance. For machines with very small inductance LS ~ 1%, very high
</p>
<p>stator currents are required in order to reduce the flux. Therefore, the operation of
</p>
<p>synchronous machines with surface-mounted magnets in the zone of flux weaken-
</p>
<p>ing is not feasible. Hence, synchronous machines with surface-mounted magnets
</p>
<p>are used in motion control applications that require high peak torque capability, fast
</p>
<p>torque changes, and low inertia.
</p>
<p>There are applications of synchronous machines that do not require fast torque
</p>
<p>changes, but they do require the field-weakening operation. In such cases, synchro-
</p>
<p>nous machines are used with permanent magnets built into interior6 parts of the
</p>
<p>rotor magnetic circuit. With stator teeth facing the iron parts of the rotor magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit, magnetic resistance is decreased while the stator self-inductance is
</p>
<p>increased. With elevated LS, reduction of the stator flux CS &frac14; CRm &thorn; LSiS can be
performed with relatively low stator currents. In absence of losses in the rotor,
</p>
<p>synchronous machines with buried magnets are applied in all cases where the
</p>
<p>efficiency is of particular importance. Some of these examples are renewable

<p>Mathematical Model of Synchronous Machine
</p>
<p>This chapter introduces and explains mathematical model of synchronous
</p>
<p>machines. The model considers three-phase synchronous machines with excita-
</p>
<p>tion windings or permanent magnets on the rotor. This model does not include
</p>
<p>damper windings, which are introduced and explained in Chap. 21. The model
</p>
<p>represents transient and steady state behavior in electrical and mechanical
</p>
<p>subsystems of synchronous machines. Analysis and discussion introduce and
</p>
<p>explain Clarke and Park coordinate transforms. The model includes differential
</p>
<p>equations that express the voltage balance in stator and rotor windings, inductance
</p>
<p>matrix which relates flux linkages and currents, Newton differential equation of
</p>
<p>motion, expression for the air gap power, and expression for the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque. The model development process is very similar to that of the induction
</p>
<p>machine, which is detailed in Chap. 15. Therefore, some considerations are
</p>
<p>shortened or removed. The model obtained in this chapter is suitable for both
</p>
<p>isotropic (cylindrical) and anisotropic (salient pole) machines. This chapter
</p>
<p>closes with some basic considerations on the reluctant torque and synchronous
</p>

<p>19.1 Modeling Synchronous Machines
</p>
<p>Dealing with synchronous generators and synchronous motors requires some basic
</p>
<p>knowledge on their electrical and mechanical properties. Electrical properties of
</p>
<p>machines involve steady state and transient relations between the machine voltages,
</p>
<p>currents, and flux linkages. Mechanical properties have to do with the rotor speed,
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque, and motion resistances. For the purpose of designing the
</p>
<p>power supply and controls, it is required to know the equations and expressions that
</p>
<p>relate voltages and currents of synchronous machine. Steady state analysis relies on

<p>equivalent circuits that involve the machine parameters and phasors representing
</p>
<p>the relevant currents, voltages, and fluxes. Mechanical properties of synchronous
</p>
<p>machines are required to design and specify the interface to mechanical loads or
</p>
<p>driving turbines.
</p>
<p>High-power synchronous machines are used as generators in electrical power
</p>
<p>plants. They are connected to three-phase network of constant frequency of f &frac14; 50
Hz or f &frac14; 60 Hz. Mechanical work is obtained via shaft from a steam or water
turbine; it is converted into electrical energy and supplied to the network. Most
</p>
<p>synchronous generators have wound rotors. The excitation winding offers the
</p>
<p>possibility of changing the excitation flux by varying the excitation current.
</p>
<p>Changes in excitation flux affect the electromotive forces and stator voltages.
</p>
<p>This opens the possibility of controlling the voltage of the network and to change
</p>
<p>the reactive power. Synchronous machines of lower power are used in applications
</p>
<p>such as motion control, vehicle propulsion, industrial robots, and automated pro-
</p>
<p>duction machines. In these applications, synchronous machines act as motors. Their
</p>
<p>tasks include overcoming the motion resistances, driving the work machines, and
</p>
<p>controlling the speed and position of tools and work pieces. There is a tendency of
</p>
<p>designing and manufacturing medium- and low-power synchronous machines with
</p>
<p>constant excitation based on permanent magnets.
</p>
<p>During transients, processes that take place in synchronous motors and
</p>
<p>generators, voltages, and currents are related by differential equations describing
</p>
<p>the voltage balance in the windings. The voltage balance equations describe the
</p>
<p>electrical subsystem of the machine. The mechanical subsystem is described by
</p>
<p>Newton differential equation of motion. The set of differential equations and
</p>
<p>expressions describing behavior of a synchronous machine is called mathematical
</p>
<p>model or dynamic model. In what follows, the mathematical model of synchronous
</p>
<p>machine is determined, with the aim of establishing the mechanical characteristic
</p>
<p>and the steady state equivalent circuit:
</p>
<p>&bull; Mechanical characteristic of synchronous machine is dependence of the electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic torque on the rotor speed in steady state for given frequency and
</p>
<p>amplitude of the stator voltage.
</p>
<p>&bull; Steady state equivalent circuit is a network of resistances and inductances which
</p>
<p>serves for calculation of electrical currents and flux linkages of synchronous
</p>
<p>machine.
</p>
<p>In the course of modeling, several approximations are taken, and certain phe-
</p>
<p>nomena of secondary importance are neglected. The iron losses are considered as
</p>
<p>negligible, and all ferromagnetic materials are assumed to be linear and free from
</p>
<p>saturation phenomena. Moreover, all the parasitic capacitances are neglected as
</p>
<p>distributed parameter effects. The model of synchronous machine will have:

<p>19.2 Magnetomotive Force
</p>
<p>Most synchronous machines have the stator winding system with three-phase
</p>
<p>windings. There are also winding systems with 5-, 7-, 9-, 17-, or even more phase
</p>
<p>windings, but they are seldom used. The operation of synchronous machines with
</p>
<p>Nph &gt; 3 phases can be represented by an equivalent three-phase machine. In a
three-phase synchronous machine with symmetrical power supply, the phase
</p>
<p>currents are

<p>ia &frac14; Im cosoet;
ib &frac14; Im cos&eth;oet� 2p=3&THORN;;
ic &frac14; Im cos&eth;oet� 4p=3&THORN;: (19.1)
</p>
<p>They have the same angular frequency and the same amplitude. Their initial
</p>
<p>phases are displaced by 2p/3. At the same time, magnetic axes of the phase
</p>
<p>windings are spatially displaced by 2p/(3p), where p is the number of pole pairs.
</p>
<p>Construction of three-phase stator windings is discussed in Chap. 14, while the
</p>
<p>aspects of machines with multiple-pole pairs are discussed in Chap. 17.
</p>
<p>The stator phase currents create the stator magnetomotive force represented by
</p>
<p>the vector FS &frac14; Fa &thorn; Fb &thorn; Fc. The phase currents given in (19.1) produce
magnetomotive force which rotates at the speed Oe &frac14; oe/p, maintaining a constant
amplitude of FS &frac14; 3/2 NIm. In order to represent the vector FS, which resides in ab
plane in Fig. 19.1, it is split in two components, corresponding to projections of the

<p>The phase currents in a three-phase winding are not independent variables, and
</p>
<p>this makes the modeling more difficult. For star-connected phase windings, the
</p>
<p>phase currents are related by ia &thorn; ib &thorn; ic &frac14; 0. Similar difficulty exist in delta-
connected phase windings, where ua &thorn; ub &thorn; uc &frac14; 0. With ic &frac14; �ia �ib, there are
only two independent currents in voltage balance equations. Therefore, it is neces-
</p>
<p>sary to replace ic by (�ia � ib) in voltage balance equations for phase c. In addition,
the angle between magnetic axes of the phase windings is 2p/3. For windings with
</p>
<p>spatial displacement of p/2, their mutual inductance is equal to zero. With displace-
</p>
<p>ment of 2p/3, there is a nonzero mutual inductances between all the phases, and this
</p>
<p>contributes to more complex voltage balance equations. The above shortcomings
</p>
<p>can be avoided by introducing the two-phase equivalent of the three-phase machine.
</p>
<p>The two-phase equivalent machine can be made with one-phase winding oriented in
</p>
<p>direction of unit vector a0 and the other-phase winding oriented in direction of unit
</p>
<p>vector b0. With two independent phase currents ia and ib and with the mutual
</p>
<p>inductance between the two orthogonal windings equal to zero, the two-phase
</p>
<p>model is readily understood.
</p>
<p>19.3 Two-Phase Equivalent
</p>
<p>The stator current vector iS is determined by dividing the vector FS by the number
</p>
<p>of turns of the stator phase winding. The vector iS can be represented as the sum of
</p>
<p>two components which are projections of the vector on the axes of ab orthogonal
</p>
<p>coordinate frame. These components are ia and ib, and they can be considered as
</p>
<p>548 19 Mathematical Model of Synchronous Machine</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>the phase currents of the equivalent two-phase winding, with the phase windings
</p>
<p>aligned with a� and b&ndash;axes. Introduction of the two-phase equivalent makes
the mathematical model more concise and intuitive. The number of phase currents
</p>
<p>is reduced to two, and the mutual inductance between the phase windings is equal
</p>
<p>to zero. The two-phase winding system with phase currents ia and ib produces the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force with projections Fa and Fb. These projections are propor-
</p>
<p>tional to corresponding currents, namely, Fa &frac14; Nia and Fb &frac14; Nib. At the
same time, the flux CSa of the phase winding a is projection of the
</p>
<p>stator flux vector CS on the axis a. The absence of mutual inductance and
</p>
<p>the circumstance that the currents and flux linkages in two phases correspond to
</p>
<p>projections of relevant vectors facilitate understanding and using the two-phase
</p>
<p>mathematical model.
</p>
<p>While introducing the two-phase equivalent, it is of interest to maintain the
</p>
<p>same flux, the same magnetic field energy, and the same torque as in original,
</p>
<p>three-phase machine. This is achieved if the amplitude and spatial orientation of
</p>
<p>the magnetomotive force FS remain unaltered. With the same magnetomotive
</p>
<p>force, the same flux and the same energy of magnetic field are obtained. There is
</p>
<p>no unique way to maintain the same vector FS with the two-phase equivalent. It
</p>
<p>can be obtained with a set of windings with lower currents and with more turns per
</p>
<p>phase or with another set of windings with larger currents and lower number of
</p>
<p>turns per phase.
</p>
<p>Removal of the three-phase winding and its replacement with the two-phase
</p>
<p>winding can be carried out in such way that the number of turns remains unchanged,
</p>
<p>Nabc &frac14; Nab. Then, vector of the stator magnetomotive force FS remains the same
provided that ia(t) &frac14; ia(t) &ndash; ib(t)/2 &ndash; ic(t)/2 &frac14; 3/2 Im cosoet and ib(t) &frac14; (sqrt(3)/2) &middot;
(ib(t) &ndash; ic(t)) &frac14; 3/2 Imsinoet. It should be noted that in the considered case, the peak
and rms values of the phase currents in the two-phase equivalent are 50% larger
</p>
<p>than corresponding currents in the three-phase winding (Fig. 19.2).

<p>Three-phase to two-phase transform (3F/2F transform) was discussed in Chap. 15.
</p>
<p>The following paragraphs are a brief reinstatement of previous considerations.
</p>
<p>19.4 Clarke 3F/2F Transform
</p>
<p>Three-phase to two-phase transform is known as Clarke transform, named after the
</p>
<p>author who proposed the first formulation of the transform. The matrix given in
</p>
<p>(19.4) is called transformation matrix. Presence of the adjustable coefficient KI
allows for a certain degree of freedom in defining the two-phase equivalent for the
</p>
<p>original three-phase machine. The number of turns of the equivalent machine does
</p>
<p>not have to be the same to that of the original machine, provided that the
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force remains unaltered. Namely, the condition of invariability of
</p>
<p>the magnetomotive force FS can be accomplished by choosing a two-phase equiva-
</p>
<p>lent with Nab &frac14; mNabc turns. Then, the currents in the phase windings ia(t) and ib(t)
should be m times lower in order to maintain the same value of FS. For that reason,
</p>
<p>the coefficient KI in (19.4) has to be KI &frac14; 1/m. The ratio of the peak currents of the
two-phase equivalent and the three-phase original is equal to (2/3)/m.
</p>
<p>In order to obtain the model of the two-phase machine, it is also necessary to
</p>
<p>transform the voltages and fluxes of the original machine to a-b coordinate system.
</p>
<p>Clarke transform for the voltages and fluxes is given by the following expressions:

<p>There is possibility to assign different values to coefficients KU, KI, and KC. For

<p>practical reasons, 3F/2F transform is adopted where all the three coefficients are

<p>same ratio of currents, voltages, and fluxes as the original machine, and the 3F/
</p>
<p>2F transform is invariant in terms of impedances and inductances.1
</p>
<p>Question (19.1): Is it possible to actually make a two-phase machine with Nab &frac14;
mNabc turnswhich produces the samemagnetomotive forceFS of the statorwinding as
</p>
<p>the original three-phase synchronousmachine andwhich has the voltages and currents
</p>
<p>(ua, ub, ia, ib) that are equal to those obtained by applying the Clarke transform to the
</p>
<p>voltages and currents of the original machine? It is assumed that transformation
</p>
<p>matrices used for the flux, voltage, and current are equal, namely, that they have the
</p>
<p>same leading coefficient (KU &frac14; KI &frac14; KC).
Answer (19.1): The same magnetomotive force FS results in the same flux FS &frac14;
FS/Rm. At the same time, the angular speed of the revolving magnetic field has to be
</p>
<p>the same in both 2-phase and 3-phase machines. For that reason, both machines
</p>
<p>have the same electromotive force induced in one turn. With that in mind, the phase
</p>
<p>voltages of the two-phase equivalent are equal to uab &frac14; m uabc. Maintaining the
amplitude of FS requires that the phase currents of the two-phase equivalent are
</p>
<p>iab &frac14; (3/2)&middot;(iabc/m). Finally, maintaining the ratio of voltages and currents requires
that the ratio uabc/iabc is equal to the ratio uab /iab. Summarizing the above

<p>Solution to Question 19.1 proves the possibility to actually make the two-phase
</p>
<p>equivalent machine with the same flux, torque, and magnetomotive force and with the
</p>
<p>same impedances and inductances as the original machine. The voltages and currents
</p>
<p>of the actual two-phase machine are obtained by applying the Clarke transform to the
</p>
<p>original variables. Considered two-phase equivalent must have sqrt(3/2) times more
</p>
<p>turns than the original machine. Voltages, currents, and fluxes of the two-phase
</p>
<p>equivalent are obtained by Clarke transform of the original variables, that is, voltages,
</p>
<p>currents, and fluxes of the three-phase winding. The 3F/2F transform to be applied
</p>
<p>must have the coefficientsKU &frac14; KI &frac14; KC&frac14; sqrt(3/2). The actual two-phasemachine
has the same torque and power as the original machine. Therefore, besides being
</p>
<p>impedance-invariant, considered Clarke transform is also power-invariant.2
</p>
<p>1 Invariability of impedances and inductances is discussed in Chap. 15. Impedance-invariant
</p>
<p>transform results in an equivalent machine where all the impedances are the same as relevant
</p>
<p>impedances of the original machine.
2Coordinate transforms do not have to be power-invariant. Generally, coordinate transforms such
</p>
<p>as Clarke transform provide another mathematical formulation of the considered dynamic system.
</p>
<p>The new model does not have to correspond to any real system. An example to that is the model of
</p>
<p>a resistor, u1 &frac14; Ri1, obtained by applying the &ldquo;transform&rdquo; u1 &frac14; 2u, i1 &frac14; 2i to the original resistor,
described by u &frac14; Ri. The model u1 &frac14; Ri1 is impedance-invariant, but it is not power-invariant.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If the three-phase winding is removed from the magnetic circuit of the original
</p>
<p>machine and replaced by the two-phase winding with sqrt(3/2) times more turns,
</p>
<p>one obtains a two-phase synchronous machine which replaces the three-phase
</p>
<p>machine. The voltages and currents obtained by using 3F/2F transform with
</p>
<p>K &frac14; sqrt(2/3) are equal to voltages and currents that can be measured on the actual
two-phase machine windings. Hence, considered 3F/2F transform with K &frac14; sqrt
(2/3) results in the two-phase equivalent machine that can be actually made. Notice
</p>
<p>at this point that the possibility of actually making the machine that comes out of
</p>
<p>the 3F/2F transform is not of particular importance.
</p>
<p>Clarke transform with K &frac14; sqrt(2/3) is invariant in terms of the magnetomotive
force, power, impedance, and inductance. In addition, it can be practically applied
</p>
<p>by making a machine with voltages and currents equal to those obtained by the
</p>
<p>transform. In spite of that, transform with coefficient K &frac14; sqrt(2/3) is seldom used.
The presence of irrational number such as sqrt(2/3) in calculations is the reason for
</p>
<p>this particular transform to be rarely used.
</p>
<p>In selecting the coordinate transform, there is freedom to choose the coefficient
</p>
<p>K so as to facilitate the use of the model. In practice, transforms with KU &frac14; KI &frac14;
KC &frac14; 2/3 and with KU &frac14; KI &frac14; KC &frac14; 1 are often used. With 3F/2F transform of
currents which uses KI &frac14; 1, one obtains the currents ia and ib with peak values and
rms values 50% larger than those of the original variables. Transform which results
</p>
<p>in currents ia and ib with peak and rms values equal to those of the phase current ia,
</p>
<p>ib, and ic, it is required to apply the coefficient K &frac14; 2/3. This choice has two
shortcomings.
</p>
<p>Clarke transform that uses K &frac14; 2/3 is not power-invariant. Namely, the power
calculated in ab domain is not the same as the power of the original machine.
</p>
<p>Notice at this point that the rms values of voltages and currents are the same for ab
</p>
<p>and abc variables. The original machine has three-phase windings, while the equi-
</p>
<p>valent machine in ab domain has only two-phase windings. Therefore, calculated
</p>
<p>power is not the same since Pab &frac14; (2/3)Pabc. As a consequence, whenever using the
3F/2F transform with K &frac14; 2/3, the actual power of the original machine has to be
calculated on the basis of the expression Pabc &frac14; (3/2) Pab.
</p>
<p>It is not possible to make an actual two-phase machine that would have the same
</p>
<p>voltages and currents as those calculated by the transform. In other words, it is not
</p>
<p>possible to rewind the existing three-phase machine and make an equivalent two-
</p>
<p>phase machine with voltages and currents that correspond to the values obtained by
</p>
<p>the considered 3F/2F transform. On the other hand, the choice K &frac14; 2/3 results in
transformed voltages and currents in ab domain that have the same amplitude and
</p>
<p>the same rms value as those of voltages and currents of the original three-phase
</p>
<p>machine. With K &frac14; 2/3, the virtual two-phase equivalent must have a larger
number of turns. In order to maintain the amplitude of the vector FS, it is necessary
</p>
<p>to have Nab &frac14; (3/2)Nabc. With the same flux per turn F &frac14; FS/Rm, the turn
electromotive forces are the same in both the original and the equivalent machine.
</p>
<p>Hence, in an attempt to make an actual two-phase equivalent, the two-phase
</p>
<p>machine has to be made with the same electromotive force per turn and with 50%
</p>
<p>more turns than the original machine. With Nab &frac14; (3/2)Nabc, the phase voltages of
</p>
<p>552 19 Mathematical Model of Synchronous Machine</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>such a machine are uab &frac14; (3/2) uabc, 50% larger than the original phase voltage. At
the same time, 3F/2F transform with K &frac14; 2/3 results in uab &frac14; uabc. This shows
that the transform that uses K &frac14; 2/3 results in a two-phase machine that does not
have a real, actual counterpart.
</p>
<p>Favorable properties of the 3F/2F transform with coefficient K &frac14; 2/3 are
invariability in terms of impedance and inductance, as well as the circumstance
</p>
<p>that the peak and rms values of the original machine are equal to those of the two-
</p>
<p>phase equivalent. The absence of invariability in terms of power is corrected by
</p>
<p>applying the formula Pabc &frac14; (3/2)Pab.
In further analysis, it will be assumed that the three-phase stator winding is
</p>
<p>replaced by the two-phase equivalent by applying Clarke 3F/2F transform which
</p>
<p>uses the coefficient K &frac14; 2/3. Unless otherwise stated, the analysis starts with an
assumption that considered synchronous machine has one pair of magnetic poles
</p>
<p>(p &frac14; 1) and that the electrical frequency o corresponds to mechanical speed O.

<p>time derivatives assume nonzero values in steady state conditions, and this creates
</p>
<p>difficulties in the steady state analysis and hinders formulation of controls of the
</p>
<p>machine. The above mentioned shortcomings are removed by applying Park coor-
</p>
<p>dinate transform. This transform represents the machine vectors in revolving dq

<p>the application of Park transform to induction machines, discussed in Chap. 15.

</p>
<p>&bull; First-time derivatives of state variables have nonzero values even in steady state
</p>
<p>conditions. State variables of the machine model which is formulated in station-
</p>
<p>ary aS&ndash;bS coordinate frame are projections of relevant vectors on aS- and bS-
</p>
<p>axes. At steady state, the rotor speed, the flux amplitude, the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque, and the conversion power are all constant. Yet, the stator phase currents,
</p>
<p>flux linkages of individual phases, their magnetomotive forces, and
</p>
<p>electromotive forces are all AC quantities. They exhibit sinusoidal change
</p>
<p>even in steady state, and their first-time derivatives are not equal to zero. This
</p>
<p>circumstance makes the analysis of steady state operation more difficult.
</p>
<p>The model deficiencies mentioned above are removed by applying transforma-
</p>
<p>tion of all the state variables to rotating coordinate system with orthogonal d- and
</p>
<p>q-axes. This dq coordinate frame revolves at the rotor speed, and it is called
</p>
<p>synchronous coordinate frame. In most cases, d‐axis is made collinear with mag-
</p>
<p>netic axis of the excitation winding. In permanent magnet machines, d-axis is made
</p>
<p>collinear with the rotor flux vector which is produced by permanent magnets.
</p>
<p>Transformation of currents, voltages, flux linkages, and magnetomotive forces
</p>
<p>into dq coordinate frame is called Park transform, and it has been explained in
</p>
<p>detail in Chap. 15.
</p>
<p>Park transform can be conceived as a replacement of the existing stator phases aS
and bS by imaginary, virtual windings residing in synchronously rotating dq
</p>
<p>coordinate frame, positioned in such way that the d-axis coincides with magnetic
</p>
<p>axis of the excitation winding. This new coordinate system rotates at the same speed
</p>
<p>as the rotor, therefore the name synchronous coordinate frame. The voltages,
</p>
<p>currents, and flux linkages of the excitation winding do not need to be transformed,
</p>
<p>as they reside already within the target dq coordinate frame. Transformation
</p>
<p>procedure and notation used hereafter are the same as the ones used in Chap. 15.
</p>
<p>The subsequent paragraphs are reduced to a brief reinstatement of the Park trans-
</p>
<p>form, already detailed in Chap. 15.
</p>
<p>With ydq &frac14; ym, the new dq coordinate system revolves at the same speed as the
rotor flux CR. In steady state conditions, relative position between vectors CR and
</p>
<p>FS does not change. Hence, dq frame revolves in synchronism with the vector of the
</p>
<p>stator magnetomotive force FS as well. Therefore, in steady state conditions,
</p>
<p>projections of both vectors on d- and q-axes are constant. The same conclusion
</p>
<p>applies to voltage, current, and stator flux vectors. Hence, Park transform provides a
</p>
<p>set of variables in synchronously rotating dq frame that all have constant values in
</p>
<p>steady state conditions.
</p>
<p>Advantage of placing the d-axis along magnetic axis of the excitation winding is
</p>
<p>the circumstance that all of the excitation flux extends along the d-axis. Namely, q
</p>
<p>component of the excitation flux CR is equal to zero. For the setup in Fig. 19.4,
</p>
<p>which includes virtual windings d and q and the excitation winding, mutual
</p>
<p>inductance between the virtual phase q and the excitation winding is equal to
</p>
<p>zero, which simplifies further considerations. In synchronous machines with

<p>permanent magnets, the d-axis is positioned so as to coincide with direction of the
</p>
<p>rotor flux CR, the flux which is caused by permanent magnets.
</p>
<p>By adopting the synchronously rotating coordinate system with d-axis aligned
</p>
<p>with the rotor magnetic axis, one obtains the system of windings shown in Fig. 19.4,
</p>
<p>with constant mutual inductances between virtual stator phases and the excitation
</p>
<p>winding and with steady state variables that assume constant values in steady
</p>
<p>state conditions. As an example, projections id and iq of the stator current vector
</p>
<p>iS &frac14; FS/NS on axes of the dq frame are constant in the steady state, when the vector
iS maintains both the amplitude and relative position with respect to dq-axes. The
</p>
<p>same can be proved for all relevant state variables. By transforming stator variables
</p>
<p>from stationary aS &ndash; bS frame to synchronously rotating dq frame, one obtains
</p>
<p>the model with all the relevant state variables constant in steady state conditions.
</p>
<p>This facilitates analysis of steady state operating regimes.
</p>
<p>The virtual stator windings d and q cannot be actually made. Instead, they serve
</p>
<p>as graphical means of grasping the effects of Park transform. One can make a

<p>thought experiment of removing the aS &ndash; bS stator windings and mounting new,

jiq, iabs &frac14; ias &thorn; jibs. Taking into account that ejy &frac14; cos(y) &thorn; jsin(y), Park trans-
form of stator currents from ab to dq coordinate frame can be represented by
</p>
<p>expression idq &frac14; e-jy iabs. Using complex numbers to represent vectors simplifies
the process of deriving the voltage balance equations in dq coordinate frame. By
</p>
<p>introducing complex notation in representing the stator voltage uabs &frac14; uas &thorn; jubs,
the voltage balance equations for the stator winding can be represented by a single

<p>Mathematical model of synchronous machine describes electrical and mechanical
</p>
<p>subsystem. The former is described by the voltage balance equations and the latter
</p>
<p>by Newton equation of motion. With two equivalent phase windings on the stator
</p>
<p>and one excitation winding on the rotor, synchronous machine has three windings
</p>
<p>and, hence, three differential equations expressing the voltage balance in these
</p>
<p>windings. Besides, the model includes the inductance matrix, which provides
</p>
<p>relations between flux linkages and currents, as well as the expression for the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque.
</p>
<p>Rotor magnetic circuit of a synchronous machine may be of cylindrical form,
</p>
<p>and in this case, magnetic resistance Rm is the same in all directions. Cylindrical
</p>
<p>rotor with which maintains the same magnetic resistance in all directions is called
</p>
<p>isotropic. Since the self-inductance of each winding depends on the ratio N2/Rm, a
</p>
<p>constant magnetic resistance results in constant self-inductances. The stator phase
</p>
<p>windings have the same number of turns, and therefore, Ld &frac14; Lq &frac14; LS. In cases
where magnetic resistances in d- and q-axes are different, the rotor is called
</p>
<p>anisotropic. In this case, self-inductances are not the same, Ld 6&frac14; Lq.
Voltage balance equations in (19.8) are written for the windings shown in
</p>
<p>Fig. 19.6, and they are applicable to both isotropic and anisotropic synchronous
</p>
<p>machines. The difference between the former and the latter appears in the induc-
</p>
<p>tance matrix.

Coefficient LR represents self-inductance of the excitation winding, while Lm is
</p>
<p>mutual inductance of the excitation winding and virtual stator phase winding in

</p>
<p>mutual inductance between the excitation winding and one of the stator phase

<p>windings, a, b, and c. The mutual inductance assumes the largest value when the

<p>and the factor dWm/dt is equal to zero. The third and the last factor of the above
</p>
<p>equation is pem &frac14; (3/2)om(Cdiq�Cqid). It is obtained by subtracting the losses
from the input electrical power. Therefore, it represents the rate of change of the
</p>
<p>electrical energy into mechanical work. It is transferred through the air gap to the
</p>
<p>rotor by means of electromagnetic interaction of the stator and rotor fields in the air

</p>
<p>Synchronous machines have the stator magnetic field revolving in synchronism
</p>
<p>with the rotor. In steady state, the angular frequency of the source oe is equal to the
</p>
<p>angular frequency of rotation pOm &frac14; om. The question arises whether oe &frac14; om
during transients. Namely, during transient processes, where the electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque Tem changes, the angle between the stator field FS and the rotor fluxCR may
</p>
<p>change as well. The vector FS revolves at the speed oe/p, while the rotor flux CR
revolves at the rotor speed Om. When the angle between the two vectors changes,
</p>
<p>there is a temporary difference between oe and pOm &frac14; om. When the machine
enters a new steady state, the vectors assume and maintain a new relative position,
</p>
<p>and the equation oe &frac14; pOm &frac14; om is reinstated.
The change between oe and om allows the angle between vectors FS and CR to
</p>
<p>change during transients. Yet, they do remain in synchronism, namely, they revolve

</p>
<p>introduced by aligning the axes d with the rotor magnetic axis, then the speed of
</p>
<p>rotation of this dq coordinate frame remains equal to om in both steady state and

</p>
<p>angular frequency om in both steady state and transient conditions.
</p>
<p>It is of interest to calculate the amount of pem that is passed to the output shaft
</p>
<p>as mechanical power. With rotor excitation based on permanent magnets, there is
</p>
<p>no excitation winding and no losses in the rotor. The power pem passed to the rotor
</p>
<p>through the air gap is converted into mechanical power. This mechanical power
</p>
<p>may not be equal to the output mechanical power of the machine, due to losses
</p>
<p>in mechanical subsystem such as friction and air resistance to rotor motion.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it is called internal mechanical power, and it is denoted by pmR &frac14; pem.
When the rotor has an excitation winding, this winding has copper losses RRiR
</p>
<p>2.
</p>
<p>These losses are supplied from an external power source that provides the voltage
</p>
<p>uR and the current iR to the excitation winding. In steady state, this power source
</p>
<p>supplies the power uRiR &frac14; RRiR2 to the excitation winding. Therefore, equation
pmR &frac14; pem applies as well to synchronous machines with electromagnetic
excitation.
</p>
<p>Internal mechanical power is equal to the product of the internal electromag-

<p>19.12 Anisotropic Rotor
</p>
<p>The rotor magnetic circuit may have a noncylindrical form which introduces the
</p>
<p>difference in magnetic resistances along d- and q-axes. This results in different self-
</p>
<p>inductances Ld and Lq of virtual stator phase windings in dq frame. Cylindrical
</p>
<p>structures, where magnetic resistance is not dependent on direction of the field, are
</p>
<p>called isotropic, which means the ones that are having the same properties in all
</p>
<p>directions. In isotropic machines, inductances Ld and Lq are equal. When magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance changes with direction of the field, then, the machine is anisotropic, and
</p>
<p>inductances Ld and Lq are different. Salient features of anisotropic machines will be
</p>
<p>presented in the following section, along with the corresponding expression for
</p>
<p>the torque.
</p>
<p>The flux of the virtual stator phase winding in d-axis is equal to Cd &frac14; Ldid &thorn;
LmiR, while the flux in the virtual stator phase winding q is equal to Cq &frac14; Lqiq.
Excitation flux does not contribute to the stator flux in q-axis. With cylindrical
</p>
<p>rotor, inductances Ld and Lq have the same value, Ld &frac14; Lq &frac14; Ls. Construction of an
anisotropic rotor is shown in Fig. 19.7, with different magnetic resistances in d- and
</p>
<p>q-axes. In the left side of the figure, there is a cross section of magnetic circuit of the
</p>
<p>rotor with electromagnetic excitation. This magnetic circuit is shaped to achieve a
</p>
<p>low magnetic resistance in d and to facilitate establishing the excitation flux.
</p>
<p>Conductors of the excitation winding are placed on the sides of the magnetic circuit,
</p>
<p>directed along q-axis. For this reason, magnetic resistance to the flux directed along
</p>
<p>q-axis is relatively high because the path of the q-axis flux includes relatively large
</p>
<p>air-filled segments. A higher magnetic resistance results in a smaller inductance
</p>
<p>L ~ N2/Rm; thus, the circumstance that Rmd &lt; Rmq results in Ld &gt; Lq.

</p>
<p>The torque expression contains an additional component, proportional to the
</p>
<p>difference of self-inductances in d- and q-axes. This torque component is called
</p>
<p>reluctant torque because it appears as a consequence of differences in magnetic
</p>
<p>resistances, also called reluctances. Reluctant torque may exist even in synchro-
</p>
<p>nous machines with no excitation winding and no permanent magnets. It is suffi-
</p>
<p>cient to have different magnetic resistances in d- and q-axes and different
</p>
<p>inductances Ld and Lq. In the absence of the rotor flux, only the stator field exists
</p>
<p>in the air gap. This torque tends to bring the rotor in position where it pays the
</p>
<p>minimum magnetic resistance to the stator flux. Hence, it acts toward aligning the
</p>
<p>rotor axis of minimum magnetic resistance with the stator flux. There are synchro-
</p>
<p>nous machines that are made with no permanent magnets and no excitation
</p>
<p>windings. Instead, their rotors have considerable differences of the magnetic
</p>
<p>resistances between the direct d-axis and quadrature q-axis. This increases the
</p>
<p>difference Ld�Lq and, hence, the reluctant torque. These machines are called
synchronous reluctance machines.
</p>
<p>Question (19.2): A synchronous machine has an anisotropic rotor with no perma-
nent magnets and no excitation winding. The amplitude of the stator current is
</p>
<p>limited to Im. Determine the largest possible value of the reluctant torque.
</p>
<p>All parameters affecting the reluctant torque are known.
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Answer (19.2): Reluctant torque is proportional to the product of currents id and iq.
When the amplitude of the stator current is limited, the current components can be
</p>
<p>expressed as id &frac14; Imcos(x) and iq &frac14; Imsin(x), where x is the angle between the
stator current vector and d-axis. The reluctant torque is then

</p>
<p>19.14 Reluctance Motor
</p>
<p>Synchronous reluctance machines are used in applications where the size and
</p>
<p>weight have no particular importance and where the prevailing goal is to have a
</p>
<p>construction which is robust, simple, and low cost. Reluctance machines have no
</p>
<p>active parts on the rotor. Rotor has only magnetic circuit made to have different
</p>
<p>magnetic resistances in direct and quadrature axes. The rotor magnetic circuit can
</p>
<p>be obtained by stacking the iron sheets in the way shown in Fig. 19.8. By stacking
</p>
<p>the iron sheets, one obtains a small magnetic resistance along the sheets and a
</p>
<p>large magnetic resistance in direction perpendicular to the sheets. The flux that
</p>
<p>passes in direction perpendicular to the sheets passes a number of times through
</p>
<p>the insulation gaps between the sheets, which increase the equivalent magnetic
</p>
<p>resistance. In the prescribed way, one obtains an anisotropic rotor, the rotor with
</p>
<p>different magnetic resistances in d- and q-axes. At the same time, the external
</p>
<p>appearance of the rotor is cylindrical, with no salient poles and with a low air
</p>
<p>drag. Therefore, the rotor may reach high speeds without significant motion
</p>
<p>resistances and without jeopardizing mechanical integrity of the machine.

<p>Advantage of synchronous reluctance machines, compared to wound rotor
</p>
<p>machines, is that the former have considerably simpler construction and they do
</p>
<p>not need to have external supply to the excitation winding through the slip rings.
</p>
<p>Compared to permanent magnet machines, reluctance machines are easier and
</p>
<p>cheaper to manufacture. One advantage of reluctance machines is the fact that the
</p>
<p>air gap flux depends on the stator current only, which opens the possibility to adjust
</p>
<p>the flux to different operating conditions, such as the field weakening.
</p>
<p>With stator currents of reluctance machine equal to zero, the flux is equal to zero
</p>
<p>as well. At the same time, the electromotive force omC is equal to zero as well. In
</p>
<p>cases where the stator winding of synchronous reluctance machine is disconnected
</p>
<p>from the source and opened, the voltages across the terminals are equal to zero, and
</p>
<p>they do not pose electrical hazard. At the same time, the fact that there are no
</p>
<p>induced voltages between the open winding terminals of a reluctance motor means
</p>
<p>that short-circuiting the terminals would not result in any stator currents. This
</p>
<p>means that reluctance motor with short-circuited stator winding and with rotor in
</p>
<p>motion does not have any stator current and does not generate any torque. Synchro-
</p>
<p>nous machines with permanent magnet excitation do not have the same behavior.
</p>
<p>The rotor flux of a permanent magnet machine is present even in cases where the
</p>
<p>machine is disconnected from the source. The voltage across the terminals of
</p>
<p>the opened stator winding is equal to the electromotive force E0 &frac14; omCRm.
When the stator terminals are short-circuited, a relatively high short-circuit current
</p>
<p>is established, approximately equal to Iks � E0/XS &frac14; CRm/LS. With low stator
inductances LS of synchronous machines with surface mounted magnets, the
</p>
<p>short-circuit currents are very large, and they result in the stator magnetomotive
</p>
<p>forces that may demagnetize and destroy the magnets. Besides, the short-circuit
</p>
<p>current Iks produces braking torque.
4 Reluctance machines do not have the short-
</p>
<p>circuit current, they have no braking torque in short-circuit conditions, and their
</p>
<p>voltage between the stator terminals is equal to zero in cases where the machine is
</p>
<p>disconnected from the source:

</p>
<p>One shortcoming of reluctance machines is their lower specific power and lower
</p>
<p>specific torque. Due to the absence of the excitation flux, the torque expression does
</p>
<p>not have component which is proportional to the productCRmiq. Instead, it has only
</p>
<p>the reluctant torque which is proportional to the product of currents id and iq.
</p>
<p>4With the stator winding in short circuit and with the short-circuit current IKS, machine does not
</p>
<p>receive any electrical power from the source. At the same time, there are copper losses in the stator
</p>
<p>winding, proportional to RSIKS
2. The power of copper losses is supplied from the only access to the
</p>
<p>machine which remains available, this access being the shaft, where the machine receives or
</p>
<p>delivers the power TemOm. In short-circuit conditions, mechanical power is absorbed through the
</p>
<p>shaft. There is a braking torque component proportional to RSIKS
2/Om which accounts for the
</p>
<p>copper losses in short circuit.

<p>A thought experiment of inserting permanent magnets into existing reluctance
</p>
<p>machine would add the component CRmiq to the torque, hence increasing the
</p>
<p>specific torque and power of the machine. It can be concluded that the ratio
</p>
<p>Tem/IS between the electromagnetic torque and the stator current is considerably
</p>
<p>lower in reluctance machines than in synchronous machines with permanent
</p>
<p>magnets or with excitation winding. For developing the same torque, the stator
</p>
<p>current of reluctance machine will be significantly larger compared to the required
</p>
<p>stator current of an excited synchronous machine. For this reason, the power and
</p>
<p>efficiency of reluctance machines are lower than those of excited synchronous
</p>
<p>machines.
</p>
<p>In order to mitigate the unfavorable ratio Tem/IS of reluctance machines, their
</p>
<p>control is conceived to maximize the torque-per-amp ratio. It is of interest to obtain
</p>
<p>the maximum possible torque for the given amplitude of the stator current. The left
</p>
<p>side of Fig. 19.9 shows a dq coordinate frame with currents id and iq on the abscissa
</p>
<p>and ordinate. The root locus denoting constant torque Tem ~ idiq is represented by a
</p>
<p>hyperbola. Various pairs of id and iq provide the same product idiq. Thus, there is a
</p>
<p>certain degree of freedom in controlling the machine, and it is to be used to
</p>
<p>minimize the losses and maximize the torque-per-amp ratio. In Fig. 19.9, the
</p>
<p>amplitude of the stator current is proportional to the radius vector that starts from
</p>
<p>the origin and ends at the selected operating point on hyperbola Tem ~ idiq. The
</p>
<p>smallest amplitude is achieved with radius vector at an angle of p/4 with respect to
</p>
<p>d- and q-axes, that is, with id &frac14; iq. Wherever possible, reluctance machines are
controlled with id &frac14; iq.

<p>Steady-State Operation
</p>
<p>Mathematical model of electrical machine contains differential and algebraic
</p>
<p>equations describ,ing the machine operation in given supply conditions and given
</p>
<p>load. Using the model, it is possible to derive the changes of the rotor speed,
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque, the air-gap flux, and phase currents during transients and
</p>
<p>in steady-state conditions. The model is needed to design the power supply of the
</p>
<p>machine and to devise control algorithm. At the same time, the model is used to
</p>
<p>predict performance of the machine in operating conditions of interest and to
</p>
<p>evaluate whether the machine is suitable for given application.
</p>
<p>The study of characteristics of synchronous machines and their performance
</p>
<p>begins with steady-state analysis. It deals with steady-state operating conditions,
</p>
<p>where the machine operates with constant speed, torque, and flux amplitude.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, mathematical model is used to derive the steady-state equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit of synchronous machine and to obtain the torque and power expressions in
</p>
<p>steady-state conditions. Operation at steady state is analyzed and illustrated by
</p>
<p>means of phasor diagrams. Some basic notions on phasors are reinstated and
</p>
<p>exercised for isotropic and anisotropic machines. The power angle is introduced
</p>
<p>and defined, and the steady-state torque is expressed in terms of the power angle.
</p>
<p>This chapter discusses and explains electrical and mechanical properties of syn-
</p>
<p>chronous machines supplied from stiff three-phase network. Steady-state operation
</p>
<p>of synchronous motors and generators is analyzed on the basis of corresponding
</p>
<p>phasor diagrams, and the expressions for the torque, active power, and reactive
</p>
<p>power are derived in terms of the power angle.

<p>of synchronously rotating coordinate frame do not change in steady-state conditions.
</p>
<p>Therefore, their first-time derivatives are equal to zero. This facilitates obtaining
</p>
<p>the steady-state equivalent scheme. At steady state, the complex numbers udq, idq,
</p>
<p>andCdq, which represent the vectors of the stator voltage, current, and flux, become
</p>
<p>complex constants. Their constant, steady-state values are denoted by us, is, andCs.
</p>
<p>These complex constants have their amplitude and angle and therefore may be
</p>
<p>treated as phasors. It is important to notice that complex constants us and is represent
</p>
<p>the steady-state voltages and currents of in three-phase stator winding. Hence, unlike
</p>
<p>common phasors, the numbers us and is represent alternating voltages and currents in
</p>
<p>a three-phase system.
</p>
<p>The absolute value of a common phasor corresponds to the rms value of the AC
</p>
<p>quantity represented by the phasor. On the other hand, the absolute values of
</p>
<p>complex numbers us and is depend on the leading coefficient of Clarke 3F/2F trans-
</p>
<p>form. Namely, relation between the rms value of the stator phase voltages and the
</p>
<p>absolute value jusj &frac14; sqrt(ud2 &thorn; uq2) of the complex constant us is determined by
coefficient K of 3F/2F transform which is used in deriving the two-phase equiva-
</p>
<p>lent of the three-phase machine. With K &frac14; 2/3, the absolute value jusj is equal to
the peak value of the stator phase voltages. To facilitate the analysis of synchronous
</p>
<p>machines, it is desirable to represent the voltage balance equations by the steady-
</p>
<p>state equivalent scheme. At steady state, there is no change of the excitation current
</p>
<p>and the excitation flux; thus,

<p>iR &frac14; const: &frac14; IR
LmIR &frac14; CRm:
</p>
<p>In synchronous machines with permanent magnets on the rotor, the rotor flux
</p>
<p>that encircles the stator winding is constant and equal to CRm. In steady state, the
</p>
<p>rotor speed is equal to the synchronous speed; thus, Om &frac14; Oe. With angular
frequency oe of the stator voltages and currents, synchronous speed is equal to
</p>
<p>Oe &frac14; oe/p, and it determines the speed of rotation of the stator magnetic field.
Therefore, Om &frac14; Oe &frac14; oe/p &frac14; om/p. Synchronously rotating dq coordinate frame
is selected so as to have the d‐axis collinear with the excitation flux, that is, with the
</p>
<p>flux of permanent magnets. Therefore, dq frame revolves at the same speed as the
</p>
<p>rotor. Relation between the electrical frequency o and the mechanical speed of
</p>
<p>rotation O in multipole machines is o &frac14; pO. Hence, the frequency which appears
in voltage balance equations is equal to om &frac14; pOm. At steady state, equation
oe &frac14; om holds.

<p>encircles the stator windings. Since direct d-axis is collinear with the rotor flux,
</p>
<p>projection of the flux CRm on quadrature q-axis is equal to zero. Therefore, in
</p>
<p>complex notation, the flux CRm is a real number, that is, CRm &frac14; CRm &thorn; j0.
</p>
<p>20.2 Equivalent Circuit
</p>
<p>At steady state, (20.1) takes the form
</p>
<p>Us &frac14; RSIs &thorn; joeCs &frac14; RSIs &thorn; joeLsIs &thorn; joeCRm: (20.2)
</p>
<p>where the voltage and current are denoted in uppercase letters which designate the
</p>
<p>steady-state values. Resistance RS and inductance LS are the parameters of the stator
</p>
<p>phase windings, while the product oeCRm represents the electromotive force. In
</p>
<p>cases where IS &frac14; 0, the stator voltage is equal to E0 &frac14; joeCRm.
Product E0 &frac14; joeCRm represents the electromotive force and also the no load
</p>
<p>stator voltage. This voltage (E0) appears across the stator terminals when the
</p>
<p>stator current is equal to zero. On the basis of the (20.2), the steady-state
</p>
<p>equivalent circuit can be represented as a series connection of electromotive
</p>
<p>force E0, reactance XS &frac14; oeLS, and resistance RS. It should be noted that the
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 20.1 corresponds to an isotropic synchronous
</p>
<p>machine where Ld &frac14; Lq &frac14; LS.
The voltage US is shown on the left side of the equivalent circuit, and it
</p>
<p>represents the stator voltage US &frac14; Ud &thorn; jUq. When using the equivalent circuit

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>in Fig. 20.1, where US &frac14; Ud &thorn; jUq, it has to be noted that the amplitude of
phasors corresponds to peak values of corresponding phase variables. The same
</p>
<p>equivalent circuit can be used with phasor amplitudes that correspond to rms
</p>
<p>values.
</p>
<p>When synchronous machine operates as motor, electrical power is drawn from
</p>
<p>the source and brought into machine. The active (real) component of the phasor IS
that represents the stator current is directed from the left to the right in Fig. 20.1.
</p>
<p>When synchronous machine operates as a generator, the phasor US represents the
</p>
<p>voltage across the electrical load that receives the electrical energy obtained from
</p>
<p>the generator. The current supplied to the load is �IS. The active component of the
stator current in this operating mode is directed from the right to the left, opposite to
</p>
<p>the reference direction denoted in Fig. 20.1.
</p>
<p>20.3 Peak and rms Values of Currents and Voltages
</p>
<p>In many cases where the equivalent circuit in Fig. 20.1 is used, it is assumed that the
</p>
<p>amplitude of relevant phasors corresponds to the peak value of related phase
</p>
<p>variables. This assumption relies on Clarke transform performed with the leading
</p>
<p>coefficient K &frac14; 2/3. Starting with the phase voltages ua(t), ub(t), and uc(t) and
applying Clarke and Park transforms, one obtains the stator voltage representation
</p>
<p>in synchronously rotating coordinate system. The voltage Ud &thorn; jUq has an ampli-
tude jUSj which is equal to the peak value of the phase voltage, Ueff &middot;sqrt(2).
Decision to assign the peak values of the phase quantities to phasor amplitudes
</p>
<p>has to be applied uniquely to all the phasors in the equivalent scheme, namely, to all
</p>
<p>the voltage, currents, electromotive forces, and flux linkages. Hence, the amplitude
</p>
<p>jE0j of the electromotive force corresponds to the peak value of the no load phase
voltage. The phasorCRm represents the rotor flux that encircles the stator windings.
</p>
<p>Its amplitude jCRmj corresponds to the amplitude of the vectorCRm, namely, to the
peak value the flux reaches in the stator phase windings. The phasor CS &frac14; LSIS &thorn;
CRm has the amplitude jCSj which corresponds to the amplitude of the stator flux
vector. With the above considerations in mind, the input power to the machine is
</p>

<p>equal to Pe &frac14; (3/2) Re(USIS*).1 The power of losses in the stator windings is calcu-
lated as PCu1 &frac14; (3/2)RSIS2. The power of electromechanical conversion is equal to
Pem &frac14; Pe &ndash;PCu1 &frac14; (3/2) Re(E0 IS*). Since flux vector CRm coincides with d-axis,
which is assigned to be the real axis of the complex d &thorn; jq plane, the electromotive
force phasor is equal to E0 &frac14; joeCRm and it is collinear with quadrature axis (q),
which is at the same time the imaginary axis of the complex d &thorn; jq plane. For this
reason, the product E0IS
</p>
<p>* assumes the value oeCRmIq. The electromagnetic torque is
</p>
<p>equal to the ratio of the power Pem and the synchronous speed Oe &frac14; oe/p:

oeCRmIq &frac14;

</p>
<p>2
CRmIq : (20.3)
</p>
<p>It is also possible to interpret the phasors of the equivalent circuit as complex
</p>
<p>numbers with amplitudes that represent rms values of relevant phase variables. In this
</p>
<p>case, the equivalent circuit operates with rms voltages and currents. The phasorUS on
</p>
<p>the left side of the equivalent circuit represents the stator voltage, and it has an
</p>
<p>amplitude jUSj that corresponds to the rms value Urms of the stator phase voltages.
Now, the electromotive force jE0j corresponds to the rms value of the no load phase
voltage. For many, working with rms values of voltages and currents is more handy.
</p>
<p>When using the phasors that correspond to rms values, the flux phasors have to be
</p>
<p>treated in the same way. Therefore, the phasorCRm, as calculated from the equivalent
</p>
<p>circuit, obtains an amplitude which is sqrt(2) times smaller than the amplitude of the
</p>
<p>flux vector CRm. At the same time, the value jCSj &frac14; jLSIS &thorn; CRmj is equal to the
amplitude of the stator flux vector divided by sqrt(2). Adopting the phasors that
</p>
<p>correspond to rms values, the input power to the machine is calculated as Pe &frac14; 3 Re
(US IS
</p>
<p>*); the power of losses in the stator winding is obtained as PCu1 &frac14; 3RSIS2,
while the power of the electromechanical conversion is equal to Pem &frac14; Pe &ndash;PCu1 &frac14;
3 Re(E0 IS
</p>
<p>*) &frac14; 3oeCRmIq. Notice at this point that both CRm and Iq in the previous
expression assume the values that are sqrt(2) times smaller than the values in (20.3).

<p>while the electromotive force E0 &frac14; joeCRm resides on the imaginary axis, the

<p>20.4 Phasor Diagram of Isotropic Machine
</p>
<p>Analysis of steady states based on the equivalent circuit relies on complex notation
</p>
<p>where the vectors of the stator voltages, currents, and flux linkages are represented by
</p>
<p>corresponding phasors. The voltage balance in the steady-state equivalent circuit can
</p>
<p>be represented by phasor diagram. The phasor diagram in Fig. 20.2 represents the
</p>
<p>balance of voltages in isotropic synchronous machine that operates in motoringmode.
</p>
<p>d-Axis of synchronously rotating coordinate frame is assigned as the real axis of the
</p>
<p>complex plane.2Thus, the q-axis becomes imaginary axis. Park rotational transform is
</p>
<p>2 Steady-state voltages and currents can be represented as phasors in an arbitrary complex plane.
</p>
<p>The angle between the phasor and the real axis determines the initial phase of considered AC
</p>
<p>voltages and currents. Apparently, this imposes a constraint on the choice of the position of the real
</p>
<p>axis. On the other hand, the initial phase is the value of the phase at the instant t &frac14; 0. Therefore, by
choosing the instant t &frac14; 0, it is possible to select complex planes with different position of their
real and imaginary axes. Phasor diagrams of synchronous machines are mostly drawn in the
</p>
<p>complex plane where the real axis coincides with d-axis of synchronously rotating coordinate
</p>
<p>system. It is also of interest to notice that other choices are legitimate as well. When solving some
</p>
<p>problems, the calculations are more simple when the real axis is selected to be aligned with the
</p>
<p>stator voltage or the stator current.

<p>introduced with d-axis being collinear with the excitation flux. Therefore, the phasor
</p>
<p>CRm resides on the real axis, and it is equal toCRm &frac14; CRm &thorn; j0.
The phasor CRm represents this part of the excitation flux that encircles the
</p>
<p>stator windings. The no load electromotive force E0 &frac14; joeCRm has a phase advance
of p/2, and it resides on imaginary axis. The stator voltage US is obtained by adding
</p>
<p>the voltage drop across the stator impedance ZS &frac14; RS &thorn; joeLS to the no load
electromotive force. The voltage drop across the stator resistance is in phase with

<p>With d &lt; 0, the voltage lags behind the electromotive force, the power and torque
are negative, and thus, the machine operates as a generator.
</p>
<p>When an isotropic synchronous machine operates as a generator, the active
</p>
<p>component of the stator current is negative. Steady-state analysis of synchronous
</p>
<p>generators is more straightforward if the reference direction of the stator current
</p>
<p>changes. In Fig. 20.3, the steady-state equivalent circuit is redrawn with altered
</p>
<p>reference direction for stator current. The new circuit is more intuitive, as it
</p>
<p>represents the generator which supplies the electrical consumers UG with generator
</p>
<p>current IG. The phasor diagram of an isotropic synchronous generator is given in
</p>
<p>Fig. 20.4.

<p>At steady state, rotor of synchronous machine revolves at synchronous speed,

<p>transient behavior of the machine can be obtained from the phasor diagram in
</p>
<p>Fig. 20.2. In a thought experiment with synchronous motor, a sudden increase in the
</p>
<p>load torque Tm results in a decrease of the rotor speed. The stator voltage vectors
</p>
<p>revolve at the speed Oe, determined by the supply frequency, while the motion of
</p>
<p>the electromotive force is determined by the rotor speed. The speed difference
</p>
<p>Oe � Om affects the power angle. The electromotive force E0 revolves at the same
speed as the rotor flux. Therefore, it starts revolving slower than the phasor US,
</p>
<p>which revolves at constant, synchronous speed Oe &frac14; oe/p. For that reason, the
power angle d starts increasing. According to (20.6), the input power pe increases,
</p>
<p>which results in an increased electromagnetic torque Tem. An increased Tem
counteracts the torque Tm and brings the synchronous machine into a new equilib-
</p>
<p>rium, a new steady-state operating conditions.
</p>
<p>Question (20.2): Make a phasor diagram for synchronous machine starting from
the example given in Fig. 21.2 and assuming that stator current IS lags behind the
</p>
<p>electromotive force by 3p/2. The stator resistance RS is negligible.
</p>
<p>Answer (20.2): The electromotive force E0 and the stator voltage US reside on
imaginary axis of the diagram. The voltage amplitude is smaller than the
</p>
<p>electromotive force by the amount of XSIS.
</p>
<p>Question (20.3): A two-pole synchronous machine operates at steady state with
power angle of d &frac14; 0. The stator voltage amplitude is equal to the no load
electromotive force. With US &frac14; E0, the stator current is equal to zero. At instant
t &frac14; 0, the shaft is loaded by the torque Tm in direction opposite to motion. Discuss
the changes in the rotor speed. Assume that the number of pole pairs is p &frac14; 1,
resulting in Om &frac14; om and Oe &frac14; oe.
Answer (20.3): At steady state, the rotor revolves at synchronous speed.
Therefore, relative position of the stator voltage US and the electromotive force
</p>
<p>E0 does not change. With d &frac14; 0 and US &frac14; E0, there is no stator current and no
electromagnetic torque. The change of the rotor speed is determined by J dOm/
</p>
<p>dt &frac14; Tem � Tm. Following the increase of the load torque, the rotor speed
decreases. The rotor starts lagging behind the voltage US and it falls behind the
</p>
<p>stator magnetic field. The voltage phasor US leads with respect to E0; thus, the
</p>
<p>angle d increases. This increase affects the input electrical power Pe and
</p>
<p>the electromagnetic torque Tem. As the torque Tem increases with d, it compensates
</p>
<p>the increase in the load torque Tm and prevents further decrease of the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>For this transient to decay, it is necessary to restore the rotor speedOm &lt; Oe to the
synchronous speed Oe. Therefore, the torque Tem must exceed the motion resis-
</p>
<p>tance torque Tm for a brief interval of time, so as to achieve a positive value of
</p>
<p>acceleration dOm/dt. This short interval of acceleration is required to restore the
</p>
<p>rotor speed to the original value, to the synchronous speed Oe. Derivative dd/dt of
</p>
<p>power angle is determined by the difference between the synchronous speed and
</p>
<p>the rotor speed, dd/dt &frac14; oe&ndash;om &frac14; p(Oe � Om). New state of equilibrium is
reached when oe &frac14; om, resulting in dd/dt &frac14;0.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>According to (20.6), the power of synchronous machine depends on no load
</p>
<p>electromotive force, on stator voltage, and on power angle. Electromotive force E0
is determined by the excitation current. Different pairs of values (E0, d) produce the
</p>
<p>same power and the same torque, provided that the product E0sin(d) remains
</p>
<p>unchanged. Hence, the machine can maintain the same power with different values
</p>
<p>of the excitation current and different values of the excitation fluxCRm. This degree
</p>
<p>of freedom can be used for to adjust reactive power Qe (20.6) exchanged between
</p>
<p>the machine and the supply network.
</p>
<p>Considering the sign of reactive power Qe, there is convention to consider
</p>
<p>positive the reactive power taken from the network and delivered to electrical
</p>
<p>loads of inductive character, such as coils, where the load current lags behind the
</p>
<p>supply voltage. Reactive power taken from the network by receivers such as
</p>
<p>capacitors is considered negative. Capacitor current leads with respect to the supply
</p>
<p>voltage. All the loads of this nature can be considered as generators of reactive
</p>
<p>power. Majority of loads and devices connected to distribution networks are of
</p>
<p>inductive nature, including electrical motors, transformers, and all the devices that
</p>
<p>include a series inductance. Parallel capacitors are often connected and used as
</p>
<p>reactive power compensators that make up for the reactive power generated by
</p>
<p>other loads.
</p>
<p>On the basis of (20.5), reactive power taken from the network by an isotropic
</p>
<p>synchronous machine is equal to
</p>
<p>Qe &frac14; 3
USn USn � E0 cos d&eth; &THORN;&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>XS
: (20.7)
</p>
<p>By reducing the excitation current IR, no load electromotive force E0 &frac14; omLmIR
reduces as well, and it may become smaller than the voltage of the network. With
</p>
<p>USn &gt; E0, reactive power Qe is positive; therefore, the machine acts as an inductive
load. With sufficient increase in excitation current and electromotive force E0,
</p>
<p>expression (20.7) becomes negative. Thus, the increase in excitation current results
</p>
<p>in negative values of reactive power. In such case, machine acts as a capacitive
</p>
<p>load. Hence, the change in excitation current changes the electromotive force and
</p>
<p>makes the machine absorb or produce reactive power Qe.
</p>
<p>Synchronous generators in hydroelectric and thermal power plants supply
</p>
<p>active power consumed by all the electrical loads that are connected to the
</p>
<p>power grid. Most of electrical loads have inductive nature, and they absorb
</p>
<p>reactive power. Therefore, besides generating the active power, most generators
</p>
<p>provide reactive power as well. The amount of reactive power produced by
</p>
<p>generators is controlled by the excitation current. In a symmetrical three-phase
</p>
<p>system with sinusoidal voltages and currents, relation S2 &frac14; P2 &thorn; Q2 connects
apparent power S, active power P, and reactive power Q. Apparent power S in
</p>
<p>continuous service is limited by rated voltages and currents. Therefore, an
</p>
<p>increase in reactive power reduces the available active power that the machine
</p>
<p>can deliver in continuous service.
</p>
<p>580 20 Steady-State Operation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>An increase in reactive power Qe increases apparent power. Therefore, it
</p>
<p>increases the stator current as well. The stator current which is sustainable in
</p>
<p>continuous service is limited due to the copper losses in stator windings. Excessive
</p>
<p>current results in overheating. Therefore, the steady-state current cannot exceed the
</p>
<p>rated current In. With rated voltages, the rated current results in the rated apparent
</p>
<p>power Sn. Starting from the steady-state conditions where P &frac14; Pn and Q &frac14; Qn, an
increase in reactive power increases the apparent power above the rated level Sn. In
</p>
<p>order to avoid overheating, the active power obtained from the generator has to be
</p>
<p>reduced.
</p>
<p>In cases where the reactive power of power consumers is compensated by using
</p>
<p>parallel capacitors distributed across transmission and distribution networks, reac-
</p>
<p>tive power request imposed on synchronous generators is waived, and their active
</p>
<p>power does not have to be reduced due to reactive power generation.

<p>20.5 Phasor Diagram of Anisotropic Machine
</p>
<p>Anisotropic machine has different inductances in virtual stator phases that reside in
</p>
<p>d- and q-axes of synchronously rotating dq frame. Therefore, phasor diagram of an
</p>
<p>anisotropic machine is more complex than phasor diagram of isotropic machine.
</p>
<p>With Ld 6&frac14; Lq, the voltage balance in stator winding cannot be expressed by relation
US &frac14; E0 &thorn; ZSIS &frac14; E0 &thorn; (RS &thorn; jomLS)IS because the voltage drops LdomId and
LqomIq across the stator inductances have different values of self-inductances.
</p>
<p>Calculation of real and imaginary components of the stator voltage must be
</p>
<p>calculated separately as they cannot be expressed by jomLSIS. Thus, Ud &frac14; RSId �
omLqIq, while Uq &frac14; E0 &thorn; RIq &thorn; omLdId. Reactances Ldom and Lqom are denoted
by Xd and Xq, respectively.
</p>
<p>The phasor diagram is drawn for steady-state operation where the electrical
</p>
<p>representation of the rotor speed om &frac14; pOm gets equal to the angular frequency of
the supply oe. The voltage balance equations along the d- and q-axes are
</p>
<p>Ud &frac14; �Us sin d &frac14; RsId � oeLqIq;
Uq &frac14; &thorn;Us cos d &frac14; RsIq &thorn; oeLdId &thorn; oeCRm: (20.8)
</p>
<p>In these equations, variable CRm &frac14; LmIR represents the part of the rotor flux
which passes through the air gap and encircles the stator windings. This definition is
</p>
<p>also used in permanent magnet machine, where variable CRm represents the part of
</p>
<p>the flux of permanent magnets which encircles the stator windings. By solving
</p>
<p>(20.8), one obtains the stator currents Id and Iq (20.9). Relation between phasors of

<p>20.6 Torque in Anisotropic Machine
</p>
<p>By selecting the complex plane with the real axis collinear with the rotor flux, as
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 20.5, the stator voltage phasor US &frac14; Ud &thorn; jUq is equal to �US sin
(d) &thorn; jUS cos(d), where US &frac14; jUSj, while d represents the power angle, the angle
between US and E0. On the basis of (20.8), which gives voltage balance in the
</p>
<p>windings, one can calculate currents Id and Iq. In large synchronous machines, the

the winding. Moreover, the iron losses in the stator magnetic circuit have been

<p>20.8 Mechanical Characteristic
</p>
<p>Mechanical characteristic Tem(Om) of an electrical machine is the steady-state
</p>
<p>dependence of electromagnetic torque and the rotor speed. It depends on the
</p>
<p>power supply conditions, namely, on the amplitude and frequency of supply
</p>
<p>voltages. Mechanical characteristic obtained with the rated power supply
</p>
<p>conditions is called natural characteristic. Mechanical characteristic of a synchro-
</p>
<p>nous machine is shown in Fig. 20.7. Previous diagram (Fig. 20.6) is not a mechani-
</p>
<p>cal characteristic. Instead, it shows dependence of the electromagnetic torque and
</p>
<p>the power angle, Tem(d), while mechanical characteristic Tem(Om) gives dependence
</p>
<p>of the electromagnetic torque and the rotor speed. Both Tem(d) and Tem(Om)
</p>
<p>dependences are defined in steady-state conditions. Synchronous machine operates
</p>
<p>in steady state only in cases where the rotor speed Om corresponds to the speed of
</p>
<p>rotation of the stator magnetic field, denoted by Oe and called synchronous speed.
</p>
<p>Therefore, mechanical characteristic Tem(Om) of synchronous machine is a straight
</p>
<p>line defined by Om &frac14; Oe. The peak values of the torque are reached at the ends of
the straight line Om &frac14; Oe given in Fig. 20.7. The peak torque is limited by the
machine reactances, and it is equal to Tem max &frac14; 3pUSE0/(oeXS).

<p>20.9 Synchronous Machine Supplied from Stiff Network
</p>
<p>Most synchronous machines are connected to three-phase network with AC
</p>
<p>voltages having the line frequency of fe &frac14; 50 or 60 Hz. Other machines are
supplied from static power converters which provide a three-phase system of
</p>
<p>voltages of variable frequency and amplitude. In the former case, the stator fre-
</p>
<p>quency oe and the voltage amplitude are determined by external factors and cannot
</p>
<p>be changed. The network where the voltage frequency and amplitude do not change
</p>
<p>and remain constant is called stiff network. In synchronous machines supplied from
</p>
<p>a stiff network, the synchronous speed cannot be changed, and the steady-state
</p>
<p>value of the rotor speed remains constant. In the latter case, the machine is supplied
</p>
<p>from a separate source, from static power converter which produces a three-phase
</p>
<p>system of voltages of adjustable amplitude and frequency. In most such cases, static
</p>
<p>power converter supplies only one machine. Therefore, the frequency and ampli-
</p>
<p>tude of the stator voltages can be varied and adjusted to achieve desired flux and
</p>
<p>desired variation of the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>In hydropower plants and thermal power plants, large power synchronous
</p>
<p>machines are used as generators, and they are connected to three-phase network
</p>
<p>of constant frequency. Mechanical power is obtained via shaft from steam turbines
</p>
<p>or waterwheels and turbines. This power is converted into electrical and delivered
</p>
<p>to the network. The rated voltage of large synchronous generators ranges from 6 up
</p>
<p>to 25 kV. They are connected to transmission networks with rated voltages from
</p>
<p>110 up to 700 kV. Each synchronous generator has a dedicated transformer that
</p>
<p>connects the stator terminal to high-voltage transmission network.
</p>
<p>Synchronous machines of lower power are used in motion control applications,
</p>
<p>where each machine has a dedicated static power converter that provides the supply
</p>
<p>voltages of variable amplitude and frequency. Motion control applications include
</p>
<p>Fig. 20.7 Mechanical

<p>20.9 Synchronous Machine Supplied from Stiff Network 585</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>propulsion of vehicles, control of industrial robots, motion tasks in production
</p>
<p>machines, and other similar tasks where it is necessary to provide a continuous
</p>
<p>change of the rotor position, speed, and torque. In motion control applications,
</p>
<p>synchronous machines operate mostly as motors which overcome the motion
</p>
<p>resistances within work machines. In speed control loops, synchronous motors
</p>
<p>are used as torque actuators, and their task is to provide the torque which
</p>
<p>corresponds to the torque command. The torque command is calculated within
</p>
<p>the speed controller, and it corresponds to the torque required to overcome the
</p>
<p>motion resistances and to achieve desired variation of the speed. Providing variable
</p>
<p>torque at variable rotor speed requires the stator voltage frequency and amplitude to
</p>
<p>be changed in continuous manner. This is achieved by supplying the stator winding
</p>
<p>from three-phase inverters which comprise semiconductor power switches and
</p>
<p>operate on pulse width modulation principles.
</p>
<p>It is of interest to study operation of synchronous machines in both cases that are
</p>
<p>mentioned above. The first to consider is the operation of synchronous machines
</p>
<p>supplied from a stiff network. The subsequent analysis considers three-phase
</p>
<p>synchronous machine connected to three-phase network with symmetrical AC
</p>
<p>voltages, wherein the voltages have constant line frequency and constant amplitude.
</p>
<p>Without the lack of generality, it is assumed that the shaft of synchronous machine
</p>
<p>is connected to driving turbine which provides the source of mechanical work and
</p>
<p>that the synchronous machine operates as a generator which converts mechanical
</p>
<p>work into electrical energy. The steady-state performance of synchronous machine
</p>
<p>is considered, described by the steady-state equivalent circuit in Fig. 20.1, phasor
</p>
<p>diagram in Fig. 20.2. In further discussion, it is of interest to investigate the impact
</p>
<p>of changes in the power angle d on the electromagnetic torque (20.3), active and
</p>
<p>reactive power (20.5). In steady-state conditions, gradual changes in the torque of
</p>
<p>the driving turbine result in changes of the power angle and the active power, while
</p>
<p>the changes in excitation current affect the reactive power.
</p>
<p>20.10 Operation of Synchronous Generators
</p>
<p>Synchronous generators in thermal and hydropower plants have the rated voltages
</p>
<p>that range from 6 to 25 kV and rated power that ranges from several tens of MW up
</p>
<p>to several hundreds of MW. Generator shaft is coupled to a steam turbine or a water
</p>
<p>turbine which provides the driving torque TT &gt; 0. This torque supports the motion
of the rotor; thus, Newton equation of motion has the form JdOm/dt &frac14; Tem &thorn; TT. At
steady state, dOm/dt &frac14; 0; thus, the electromagnetic torque of the generator is
negative and equal to Tem &frac14; �TT. The power of electromechanical conversion
Pe &frac14; TmOm is also negative, illustrating the fact that the electromechanical energy
conversion within the machine has opposite direction, since the mechanical work
</p>
<p>gets converter into electrical energy. In the phase diagram of generator (Fig. 20.4),
</p>
<p>the electromotive force E0 leads with respect to the voltage US; thus, the power
</p>
<p>586 20 Steady-State Operation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>angle d is negative. Power Pe delivered to the machine from the network is negative
</p>
<p>in generator mode, and it is equal to
</p>
<p>Pe &frac14; 3
USnE0
</p>
<p>XS
sin d&eth; &THORN; &frac14; �PG; (20.14)
</p>
<p>where PG denotes the active power delivered from the generator to the network.
</p>
<p>Assuming that the network has a constant line frequency, the change in power angle
</p>
<p>is described by dd/dt &frac14; oe � pOm. With constant oe, an increase in the rotor
speed causes the power angle to reduce. An equilibrium point is reached when
</p>
<p>Om &frac14; oe/p.
It is of interest to study behavior of synchronous generators in cases where the
</p>
<p>driving turbine torque TT exhibits small changes and also in cases where the line
</p>
<p>frequencies oe changes by a very small amount.
</p>
<p>20.10.1 Increase of Turbine Power
</p>
<p>The power of steam turbines or water turbines can be increased or decreased
</p>
<p>according to requirements. Variation of the steam turbine power is achieved by
</p>
<p>means of opening or closing the valves that feed the steam from the boiler to the
</p>
<p>steam turbine and also by operating the valves that change the air and coal dust
</p>
<p>supply to the boiler. The power of a water turbine changes in a similar manner. An
</p>
<p>increased turbine power results in a larger turbine torque TT which is passed to the
</p>
<p>synchronous generator, where it tends to increase the rotor speed. Starting from the
</p>
<p>state of equilibrium where Tem0 &frac14; �TT0, an increase of the turbine torque to a new
value of TT1 &frac14; TT0 &thorn; DT leads to an increase of the rotor speed according to
equation JdOm /dt &frac14; Tem &thorn; TT &frac14; &thorn;DT.
</p>
<p>An increase of the rotor speed changes the power angle d according to dd/
</p>
<p>dt &frac14; oe � pOm. The motion of the electromotive force E0 &frac14; jpOmCRm is deter-
mined by the rotor speed, while the voltage US rotates at synchronous speed
</p>
<p>Oe &frac14; oe/p, determined by the network frequency. With an increase in the rotor
speed, the power angle delta decreases, and the phase lead �d of electromotive
force with respect to the stator voltage increases. The power angle assumes negative
</p>
<p>values in generator mode, and it goes further in negative direction. The generator
</p>
<p>power PG &frac14; �Pe &frac14; �3(USnE0/XS)sin(d) is increased. Along with that, the electro-
magnetic torque Tem &frac14; Pe/Oe &lt; 0 increases in magnitude. With JdOm/dt &frac14; Tem &thorn;
TT, a new equilibrium with JdOm/dt &frac14; 0 can be reached when the electromagnetic
torque reaches the value of Tem &frac14; �TT1. The nature of transient phenomena that
take place while reaching the new equilibrium is discussed later. In this new steady
</p>
<p>state, electrical power delivered by the generator to the transmission network is
</p>
<p>increased. It is assumed that the excess power in the network gets counteracted by
</p>
<p>an increase in electrical power consumption of electrical loads that are connected to
</p>
<p>the network. If the assumption that the network is stiff holds, the end of the excess
</p>
<p>20.10 Operation of Synchronous Generators 587</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>power does not put in question the above considerations. In an actual network,
</p>
<p>however large, the line frequency may exhibit small changes in consequence to
</p>
<p>variation in electrical power consumption or variation in mechanical power deliv-
</p>
<p>ered by steam and water turbines.
</p>
<p>In a thought experiment with an electrical network that has several generators
</p>
<p>and a number of constant power electrical consumers, it is of interest to consider the
</p>
<p>events that take place when all the steam and water turbines increase their mechan-
</p>
<p>ical power at the same time. If all the electrical consumers retain the same power,
</p>
<p>then the sum of power generated by all the generators in the network must remain
</p>
<p>constant as well. Namely, unless otherwise stated, the network does not have means
</p>
<p>to accumulate or store the excess of electrical energy. Therefore, the sum of power
</p>
<p>generated by all the synchronous generators has to remain constant. With PG &frac14;
�Pe &frac14; const., the electromagnetic torque Tem has to remain constant as well.
According to Newton equation of motion JdOm/dt &frac14; Tem &thorn; TT, an increase in TT
in conditions where Tem remains constant results in an increase of the rotor speed.
</p>
<p>Hence, in the considered thought experiment, the rotor speed in all generators will
</p>
<p>increase, increasing in such way the line frequency of the considered network.
</p>
<p>Excess energy that comes from the steam and water turbines is not converted into
</p>
<p>electrical energy. Instead, it is stored as kinetic energy of revolving masses, Wkin
</p>
<p>&frac14;
P
</p>
<p>1
2
JOm
</p>
<p>2. If the situation with excess turbine power persists, the line frequency
</p>
<p>of the network is continuously increased due to continuous increase in the rotor
</p>
<p>speed of synchronous machines.
</p>
<p>In practical power networks, an increase in the line frequency indicates the
</p>
<p>excess power received from the steam and water turbines, while a decrease in the
</p>
<p>line frequency indicates the lack of mechanical power delivered to generators and/
</p>
<p>or an excessive consumption.
</p>
<p>Question (20.4): The problem statement relies on the above thought experiment,
where the power of steam and water turbines increases, where the power of
</p>
<p>electrical consumers remains constant, and where the rotor speed and the line
</p>
<p>frequency increase. Assume that the power system considered above has one
</p>
<p>high-voltage transmission line connected to a much larger power system. This
</p>
<p>second, larger power system can be treated as a stiff network. Series reactance XS
of the transmission line is known, as well as the voltage amplitudesU1 andU2 of the
</p>
<p>two power systems. Both systems have symmetrical systems of three-phase
</p>
<p>voltages. Consider the effects of such connection on the behavior of the system
</p>
<p>with the excess power.
</p>
<p>Answer (20.4): The two electrical power systems with voltages U1 and U2,
connected by means of the transmission line with the series reactance X, can be
</p>
<p>represented as two voltage sources connected by a series impedance jX. This
</p>
<p>representation is similar to the equivalent circuit in Fig. 20.1, where the voltage
</p>
<p>US gets connected to the voltage E0 across the series impedance.
</p>
<p>588 20 Steady-State Operation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Phasors U1 and U2 have the phase difference r. This phase difference changes
</p>
<p>according to equation dr/dt &frac14; oe1 � oe2, where oe1 is the line frequency of the
first power system while oe2 is the angular frequency of the second power system.
</p>
<p>According to (20.6), the power exchanged between the two power systems can be
</p>
<p>expressed as Px &frac14; 3(U1U2/X) sin r. As the mechanical power of turbines in the first
power system increases, the line frequency oe1 will increase as well due to an
</p>
<p>increase in rotor speed of synchronous generators within the first power system. At
</p>
<p>the same time, the line frequency oe2 in the second, larger power system remains
</p>
<p>the same. The angle r will increase due to dr/dt &gt; 0. Therefore, the phasor U1
increases the phase advance with respect to the phasor U2, and the power Px ~ sin r
</p>
<p>increases. Hence, the excess power of the first power system gets passed to the
</p>
<p>second power system. On the long run, a new steady-state condition appears with
</p>
<p>oe1 &frac14; oe2.
Notice at this point that the energy and power exchange between the two power
</p>
<p>systems takes place automatically, without any need for the system operator to
</p>
<p>commutate any switches or to issue any commands. At the same time, connection
</p>
<p>between the two power systems helps in resolving problems of temporary excess of
</p>
<p>power in one of the systems as well as problems of temporary increase in power
</p>
<p>consumption.
</p>
<p>20.10.2 Increase in Line Frequency
</p>
<p>Line frequency in power network determines the phase angle of the stator voltage
</p>
<p>US. When the network frequency increases, the power angle d changes. Considering
</p>
<p>synchronous generator with d &lt; 0 and with the power angle time derivative dd/dt
&frac14; oe � pOm, negative value of the power angle becomes closer to d &frac14; 0. Genera-
tor power PG &frac14; �3(USnE0/XS)sin(d) decreases, as well as the magnitude of the
electromagnetic torque. These considerations can be applied to any and
</p>
<p>all synchronous generators connected to the electrical power network. Therefore,
</p>
<p>whenever the line frequency oe &frac14; 2pfe of the power system increases, the power
received from synchronous generators reduces. At the same time, a sudden increase
</p>
<p>20.10 Operation of Synchronous Generators 589</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>of power consumed by electrical loads reduces the speed of revolving rotors and
</p>
<p>causes a decrease in the line frequency.
</p>
<p>On the basis of the above examples, it can be concluded that electrical power
</p>
<p>systems with synchronous generators have a strong coupling between the power
</p>
<p>and the line frequency. This P-f relation is one of basic power system properties,
</p>
<p>and it provides the grounds for the power regulation and the frequency regulation.
</p>
<p>20.10.3 Reactive Power and Voltage Changes
</p>
<p>A synchronous generator delivers the power PG &frac14; �3(USnE0/XS)sin(d) with differ-
ent values of the electromotive force and different values of power angle. In order to
</p>
<p>maintain a constant power, it is of interest to keep the product E0sin(d) constant.
</p>
<p>The electromotive force E0 can be varied by changing the excitation current of the
</p>
<p>generator. It is possible to change the excitation current, to change the fluxCRm and
</p>
<p>the electromotive force E0 &frac14; omCRm, and yet to maintain the same power,
provided that the product E0sin(d) remains the same. This degree of freedom can
</p>
<p>be used to change the reactive power Qe absorbed by the machine from the three-
</p>
<p>phase network. Reactive power of an isotropic synchronous machine is proportional
</p>
<p>to the voltage difference between the stator voltage and the electromotive force E0:
</p>
<p>Qe &frac14; 3
USn USn � E0 cos d&eth; &THORN;&eth; &THORN;
</p>
<p>XS
: (20.15)
</p>
<p>By increasing the excitation current IR, electromotive force E0 &frac14; omLmIR
becomes larger than the stator voltage; thus, the reactive power Qe becomes
</p>
<p>negative. In this way, synchronous generator becomes a source of reactive power,
</p>
<p>and its equivalent impedance has capacitive nature. Majority of electrical
</p>
<p>consumers has an inductive power factor and consumes reactive power, behaving
</p>
<p>as a coil. Therefore, electrical power system must comprise adequate sources of
</p>
<p>reactive power.
</p>
<p>Transmission of reactive power across transmission and distribution line results
</p>
<p>in significant voltage drops. Most transmission lines have their equivalent series
</p>
<p>reactance X considerably larger than equivalent series resistance R. In cases where a
</p>
<p>three-phase electrical load gets connected at the end of the transmission line, where
</p>
<p>it absorbs reactive power Q and has the voltage UEND &frac14; UEND, the current of
the transmission line is equal to I &frac14; �jQ/(3UEND). The voltage at the beginning
of the transmission line is equal to UBEG &frac14; UEND &thorn; jXI &frac14; UEND &thorn; XQ/(3UEND).
The voltage drop jXI is collinear (in phase) with the voltages. Hence, the value XI is
</p>
<p>directly subtracted from UBEG in order to obtain UEND.
</p>
<p>Notice at this point that replacing reactive power consumer by resistive load
</p>
<p>which absorbs active power P &frac14; Q results in a significant reduction of the voltage
drop. With resistive load, the current of the same amplitude results in much smaller
</p>
<p>590 20 Steady-State Operation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>difference in amplitudes of UBEG and UEND. With I &frac14; P/(3UEND), UBEG &frac14; UEND
&thorn; jXP/(3UEND). The voltage drop jXI is perpendicular (phase shifted by p/2) with
respect to UEND, and this circumstance results in jUBEGj � jUENDj &lt;&lt; XI.
</p>
<p>Whenever electrical loads absorb reactive power, there are considerable voltage
</p>
<p>drops across the transmission lines. As a consequence, it is necessary to increase the
</p>
<p>stator voltage of synchronous generators in order to maintain constant voltage at
</p>
<p>electrical loads. For this to achieve, it is necessary to increase the excitation
</p>
<p>current IR of synchronous generators, which leads to increased flux CRm and
</p>
<p>increased electromotive force E0. At the same time, an increase in E0 contributes
</p>
<p>to increased reactive power delivered from generators to the network.
</p>
<p>From the above considerations, it is concluded that the voltage across the
</p>
<p>network and the reactive power flow are strongly related. This U-Q relation
</p>
<p>constitutes the bases for the voltage control in electric power systems.
</p>
<p>20.10.4 Changes in Power Angle
</p>
<p>Changes in mechanical power received from steam or water turbines result in
</p>
<p>transient response of synchronous machine which ends in a new steady-state
</p>
<p>condition with a different value of power angle. A sudden increase in electrical
</p>
<p>load of the generator produces the same effect. It is of interest to investigate the
</p>
<p>transient response of the machine torque, power, and power angle during such
</p>
<p>transients.
</p>
<p>With constant power supply frequency, the stator voltage vector rotates at
</p>
<p>constant synchronous speed Oe &frac14; oe/p, determined by the supply frequency oe.
The rotor flux is created by the current IR in the excitation winding, which revolves
</p>
<p>with the rotor. Therefore, the vector of the rotor flux revolves at the rotor speed Om.
</p>
<p>The excitation fluxCRm creates the electromotive force E0 &frac14; jCRmOm in the stator
windings. In steady state, the stator voltage and electromotive force are represented
</p>
<p>by phasors US and E0. Power angle d represents the difference in initial phases
</p>
<p>of the stator voltage and the electromotive force. It changes according to the law3
</p>
<p>dd/dt &frac14; oe � om &frac14; oe � pOm. The phase of the stator voltage depends on
the supply frequency oe, while the phase of the electromotive force depends on
</p>
<p>the rotor speed pOm. Therefore, changes in power angle d are defined by the speed
</p>
<p>difference between the synchronous speed and the rotor speed. At the same time,
</p>
<p>the electromagnetic torque of synchronous machine operating in the steady state
</p>
<p>depends on the product of US, E0, and sine of the power angle.
</p>
<p>3 In phasor diagrams, phasors US and E0 represent an AC stator voltage and an AC electromotive
</p>
<p>force. The power angle d represents the phase difference or the electrical shift between the stator
</p>
<p>voltage and the electromotive force. Therefore, the first-time derivative of power angle is equal to
</p>
<p>dd/dt &frac14; p(Oe � Om) &frac14; oe � pOm &frac14; oe � om, where p is the number of pole pairs.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Variation of the torque in terms of the power angle d is presented in Fig. 20.8.
</p>
<p>If the machine operates with no load, the power angle is equal to zero, as well as the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque. If the motion resistance torque Tm appears, directed toward
</p>
<p>reducing the rotor speed, the power angle increases because its derivative dd/
</p>
<p>dt &frac14; oe � pOm becomes positive. The increase in the power angle increases the
electromagnetic torque. A new equilibrium is reached when Tem &frac14; Tm.
</p>
<p>Assuming that the machine is connected to steam or water turbine which provides
</p>
<p>the torque TT, directed toward increasing the rotor speed, the rotor speed Om exceeds
</p>
<p>the synchronous speedOe, and the power angle dd/dt &frac14; oe � pOm obtains a negative
first derivative and a negative value. A negative value of d means that the
</p>
<p>electromotive force phasor E0 leads with respect to the voltageUS. Machine develops
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque Tem &lt; 0 which is opposite to the rotor motion; thus, the
machine operates as a generator, converting mechanical work into electrical energy.
</p>
<p>In cases where the power angle is relatively small, it is justified to adopt the
</p>
<p>approximation sin(d) � d and to represent the torque Tem by an approximate
expression Tem � kd. At steady state, the electromagnetic torque is in equilibrium
with the torque components resulting from the mechanical subsystem. When the
</p>
<p>machine operates as motor, electromagnetic torque is equal to motion resistances
</p>
<p>Tm. When the machine operates as generator, electromagnetic torque is equal to the
</p>
<p>torque provided by steam or water turbines. In both cases, the rotor speed does not
</p>
<p>change since JdOm/dt &frac14; Tem&ndash;Tm &frac14; 0 in motoring mode and JdOm/dt &frac14; Tem &thorn; TT
&frac14; 0 in generator mode. At steady state, the rotor revolves at synchronous speed
Om &frac14; Oe. It is of interest to determine the character of transients which appear due
to disturbances such as the load torque changes or changes in the line frequency oe.
</p>
<p>In the subsequent considerations, it is assumed that the number of pairs of magnetic
</p>
<p>poles is p &frac14; 1; thus, the angular frequencies of electrical variables om and oe are
equal to corresponding mechanical speeds Om and Oe. Therefore, Newton equation
</p>
<p>of motion is written as J dom/dt &frac14; Tem � Tm, where Tm represents the motion
resistances. Alternatively, �Tm &frac14; TT represents the driving torque of the steam or
water turbine. With that in mind, the change in the power angle is determined by

<p>Staring from no load conditions where d &frac14; 0, Tem &frac14; 0, and om &frac14; oe, and
introducing the step change in the load torque Tm (or the turbine torque TT), a
</p>
<p>transient interval follows where the rotor speed, electromagnetic torque, and power
</p>
<p>angle change and fluctuate before entering another steady-state condition. During
</p>
<p>these transients, the rotor speed is not equal to the synchronous speed. Taking into
</p>
<p>account that position of the dq coordinate system is determined by the rotor
</p>
<p>position, while the vector of the stator voltage depends on the power supply
</p>
<p>frequency, it is concluded that the stator voltage vector will move with respect to
</p>
<p>selected dq coordinate frame. For this reason, projections Ud and Uq of the stator
</p>
<p>voltage vector US on the axes of dq frame will change during transients. Electrical
</p>
<p>subsystem of synchronous machine is represented by voltage balance equations
</p>
<p>in virtual stator phases that are placed in d-axis and q-axis of dq frame. Changes in
</p>
<p>corresponding voltages Ud and Uq introduce nonzero derivatives of flux linkages
</p>
<p>Cd and Cq, thus bringing the electrical subsystem in transient state. Hence, during
</p>
<p>transients in mechanical subsystem, where the electromagnetic torque, the rotor
</p>
<p>speed, and the power angle exhibit transient changes, the electrical subsystem of
</p>
<p>synchronous machine does not remain in steady-state condition, and it enters
</p>
<p>transient state of its own.
</p>
<p>While in transient state, electrical subsystem of synchronous machines cannot be
</p>
<p>represented by the steady-state equivalent circuit. At the same time, the transient
</p>
<p>torque cannot be represented by simplified expression such as Tem � kd, which is
derived from the steady-state equivalent circuit.
</p>
<p>Within the next chapter, it will be shown that the time constants of mechanical
</p>
<p>subsystems are considerably larger than the time constants of electrical subsystem.
</p>
<p>This circumstance will be used to simplify transient analysis of synchronous

<p>machines.

<p>Chapter 21
</p>
<p>Transients in Sychronous Machines
</p>
<p>In this chapter, transient response of synchronous machines connected to stiff
</p>
<p>network is analyzed and discussed. Analysis of transients in electrical and mechan-
</p>
<p>ical subsystems of synchronous machines is relatively complex due to a relatively
</p>
<p>large number of state variables, such as the rotor position and speed, and the
</p>
<p>winding currents and flux linkages. Complexity of mathematical model does not
</p>
<p>help the process of understanding the nature of transients and hinders deriving
</p>
<p>corresponding conclusions. The analysis can be simplified by introducing the
</p>
<p>assumption that transients in electrical subsystem decay considerably faster than
</p>
<p>those of mechanical subsystem. In this way, analysis of transients in mechanical
</p>
<p>subsystem can be performed by using steady state model of electrical subsystem.
</p>
<p>In this way, results are made more legible and intuitive.
</p>
<p>This chapter begins with introducing and explaining the time constants that
</p>
<p>characterize transient response in electrical subsystem and mechanical subsystem
</p>
<p>of synchronous machines. For synchronous machine supplied from stiff network,
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque is expressed in terms of the power angle. Transient response
</p>
<p>of the rotor speed, power angle, and the electromagnetic torque is obtained from
</p>
<p>Newton differential equation of motion, and from the torque-power angle relation.
</p>
<p>Damper winding is introduced and explained as the means of suppressing
</p>
<p>oscillations of the torque, power, and speed caused by sudden changes at electrical
</p>
<p>or mechanical accesses to the machine. Some typical realizations of damper
</p>
<p>winding are introduced and discussed.
</p>
<p>In the second half of this chapter, analysis is focused on the short-circuit
</p>
<p>transient in synchronous generators. Short-circuit analysis is simplified by the
</p>
<p>assumption that transient processes in damper windings are the first to decay during
</p>
<p>the subtransient interval. Within the subsequent interval called transient interval,
</p>
<p>transient processes in excitation winding cease. Eventually, transient phenomena
</p>
<p>disappear, and the stator current reduces to steady state short-circuit current.
</p>
<p>A series of reasonable assumptions and engineering considerations results in
</p>
<p>deriving subtransient and transient time constants, and in subtransient, transient,
</p>
<p>and steady state reactances and short-circuit currents. This chapter ends by
</p>
<p>indicating most typical values of relevant time constants and reactances.

<p>21.1 Electrical and Mechanical Time Constants
</p>
<p>Transient phenomena in electrical subsystem have to do with winding currents and
</p>
<p>flux linkages in the air gap and in corresponding magnetic circuits. Transient
</p>
<p>response in machine windings is characterized by electrical time constants. Electri-
</p>
<p>cal current in a winding of resistance R, with self-inductance L and with the voltage
</p>
<p>u &frac14; 0, decays exponentially, according to the law i(t) &frac14; i(0)∙e�t/t, where t &frac14; L/R
is the electrical time constant of the winding. The change i(t) &frac14; i(0)∙e�t/t, the
winding current takes place in cases where the winding does not have any coupling
</p>
<p>with other windings. In synchronous machines, the stator phase windings and the
</p>
<p>excitation winding are coupled, and they interact and affect the change of currents
</p>
<p>and flux linkages. Therefore, transient response may not be exponential, and
</p>
<p>the time constant can be different than t &frac14; L/R. Nonetheless, the time constant
t &frac14; L/R serves as a rough description of dynamic processes in electrical subsystem.
In smaller machines, time constants of the windings are of the order of several tens
</p>
<p>of milliseconds, while high-power machines have time constants t &frac14; L/R in excess
to 1 s. On the other hand, transient phenomena in mechanical subsystem are
</p>
<p>considerably slower. Synchronous generators have massive rotors with significant
</p>
<p>inertia. They are coupled to steam or water turbines with certain inertia J as well.
</p>
<p>Due to large inertia, rotor speed changes, and transient phenomena in mechanical
</p>
<p>subsystem are considerably longer than the time constants of electrical subsystem.
</p>
<p>With that in mind, analysis of transients in mechanical subsystem can be simplified.
</p>
<p>While introducing disturbances into mechanical subsystem, such as the torque
</p>
<p>changes, electrical subsystem of the machine gets disturbed as well. Due to much
</p>
<p>shorter electrical time constants, transient processes in electrical subsystem would
</p>
<p>quickly decay. Following that, electrical subsystem can be modeled by steady state
</p>
<p>equivalent circuit. For the largest part of the transient process in mechanical
</p>
<p>subsystem, electromagnetic torque can be modeled by (20.11) and considered
</p>
<p>proportional to sin(d).
</p>
<p>Neglecting transient phenomena in the windings and considering them much
</p>
<p>quicker than transient processes in mechanical subsystem, the changes in electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic torque can be considered proportional to sin(d). Analysis of relatively
</p>
<p>small torque changes in close vicinity of no load operating point where Tem &frac14; 0 and
d &frac14; 0, electromagnetic torque can be approximated by Tem � kd.
</p>
<p>21.2 Hunting of Synchronous Machines
</p>
<p>During transient phenomena, the power angle changes according to dd/dt &frac14; oe � om.
The second derivative of the power angle can be determined as d2d/dt2 &frac14; doe/dt �
dom/dt. Assuming that the supply frequency oe does not change, it follows that dom/
</p>
<p>dt &frac14; �d2d/dt2. For a two-pole machine where p &frac14; 1 andOm &frac14; om, Newton equation
of motion takes the form

<p>Differential equation (21.1) can be transferred into algebraic equation by applying

<p>Laplace transform. Instead of the time function d(t), algebraic equation has the
</p>
<p>complex image L(d(t)) &frac14; d(s), where s denotes Laplace operator. It is assumed that
the load torque disturbance Tm(t) changes at instant t &frac14; 0 from Tm(0�) &frac14; 0 to Tm(0+)
&frac14; TM. Prior to the load torque step, the system was in steady state with Tem &frac14; 0,
d(0) &frac14; 0, and dd/dt(0) &frac14; 0. With that in mind, Laplace transform is applied to

<p>Complex image Tm(s) &frac14; TM/s represents Heaviside function h(t)∙TM which

</p>
<p>The function W(s) is called transfer function because it relates the input and the
</p>
<p>output of the system. Complex image Tm(s) of the load torque Tm(t) is considered to
</p>
<p>be the input to the system since the torque changes originate transient phenomena in
</p>
<p>the system. Complex image d(s) of the power angle d(t) is the system response, and
</p>
<p>it is considered to be the output of the system. Polynomial f(s) &frac14; Js2 &thorn; k in
denominator of the transfer function is called characteristic polynomial.
</p>
<p>Zeros of characteristic polynomial are the roots of equation f(s) &frac14; 0, and they are
called poles of the transfer function. These poles determine character of the system
</p>
<p>response, namely, whether response is aperiodic or with oscillations. The poles also
</p>
<p>determine the response speed and decay time of eventual oscillations. With charac-
</p>
<p>teristic polynomial of the form f(s) &frac14; (s � s1)(s � s2), which has two finite zeros s1
and s2, the system response d(t) to the input step change Tm(t) comprises factors exp
</p>
<p>(s1t) and exp(s2t). With s1 &frac14; �1/t, the system response comprises factors such
as exp(�t/t). With s1 &frac14; �jo0, the system response comprises factors such as exp
(�jo0t) &frac14; cos(o0t) � jsin(o0t). With s1 &frac14; �1/t � jo0, the system response
comprises factors such as exp(�t/t � jo0t) &frac14; exp(�t/t)∙cos(o0t) � j∙exp(�t/t)
∙sin(o0t).
</p>
<p>Characteristic polynomial f(s) &frac14; Js2 &thorn; k has two finite zeros s1/2 &frac14; �j∙sqrt(k/J)
&frac14; �jo0. Therefore, the load step response of considered synchronous machine is
oscillatory. According to (21.1), characteristic polynomial has two poles on imagi-
</p>
<p>nary axis of s-plane, �jo0. This means that the response does not decay.

<p>Namely, the oscillations caused by the load step would persist indefinitely.
</p>
<p>In practice, the oscillations gradually decay due to friction and secondary effects
</p>
<p>and losses that were not modeled in (21.1). Though, decay may be extremely slow.
</p>
<p>Conclusion concerning oscillatory character of the response can be derived
</p>
<p>without preceding discussion that involves characteristic polynomial and response
</p>
<p>character. Instead, one can rely on similarity between the considered mechanical
</p>
<p>subsystem and a series LC circuit. It is necessary to consider LC circuit which stays
</p>
<p>at rest for t &lt; 0, with uC &frac14; 0 and iL &frac14; 0, and then gets connected to voltage source
+E at instant t &frac14; 0. Complex image of the voltage step E h(t) is E/s. Impedances of
capacitor and inductor are ZC &frac14; 1/(sC) and ZL &frac14; sL, respectively. Complex image
of the capacitor voltage is uC(s) &frac14; (E/s)∙ZC/(ZC &thorn; ZL) &frac14; (E/s)/(1 &thorn; LCs2). It is
well known that series LC circuit exhibits oscillations following the step change of
</p>
<p>the input voltage. The oscillations of the capacitor voltage and inductor current
</p>
<p>of LC circuit have angular frequency o0 &frac14; 1/sqrt(LC), determined by the roots of
equation 1 &thorn; LCs2 &frac14; 0, s1/2 &frac14; �j/sqrt(LC). In LC circuit where uC &frac14; 0 and iL &frac14; 0

<p>dd/dt &frac14; oe � om &frac14; (TM/k)o0 sino0t, and it has the average value equal to zero.
Hence, during oscillations of synchronous machine, the rotor speed Om oscillates
</p>
<p>around synchronous speedOe. During transients, the instantaneous value of the rotor
</p>
<p>speed Om(t) is derived from Oe(t) according to oe � om &frac14; (TM/k)o0 sino0t. Yet,
the average value of the rotor speed remains equal to the synchronous speed even

<p>during transients. In an attempt to visualize the transient response in phasor diagram
</p>
<p>shown in Fig. 20.2, the phasor E0 oscillates around US, but they do remain in close
</p>
<p>vicinity.
</p>
<p>During oscillations, power angle d may approach the value of p/2. It reaches
</p>
<p>d &frac14; p/2 in cases where the electromagnetic torque Tem(t) reaches the peak electro-
magnetic torque Tem max (20.13). With the load torque TM &frac14; Tem max/2, oscillations
of electromagnetic torque reach twice the value of the initial step, and, conse-
</p>
<p>quently, the power angle d reaches the value of p/2. Notice in the region d &gt; p/2 in
Fig. 20.6 that electromagnetic torque does not increase with the power angle.
</p>
<p>Instead, for d &gt; p/2, the electromagnetic torque decreases, and the value
dTem(d)/dd becomes negative. Coefficient k in (21.1) represents the slope of the
</p>
<p>torque-power angle curve, and it is equal to dTem(d)/dd. With k &lt; 0, TM &gt; 0, and
with d &gt; p/2, the second time derivative of the power angle d2d/dt2 &frac14; doe/dt �
dom/dt becomes positive. Therefore, the difference oe � om does not decrease.
Instead, it continues to rise, and the machine falls out of synchronism. This actually
</p>
<p>means that the rotor speed reduces to such an extent that the return into synchronism
</p>
<p>is no longer possible. With the speed difference oe � om which has a nonzero
average value ok, the power angle progressively increases according to d(t) � okt

force E0 leads with respect to the phasor US, and the power angle becomes

<p>negative, 0 &gt; d &gt; �p/2, which results in negative electromagnetic torque and
power. Falling out of synchronism occurs when the power angle drops below �p/2.
Following that, power angle progressively reduces, producing electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque Tem(t) which oscillates and which has zero average value. The driving torque
</p>
<p>of the turbine continues to deliver a positive torque which accelerates the rotor and
</p>
<p>increases the rotor speed above the synchronous speed. In order to prevent the
</p>
<p>synchronous machine from falling out of synchronism, it is necessary to provide
</p>
<p>damping of oscillations.

<p>21.3 Damped LC Circuit
</p>
<p>In order to get an insight into possible ways of damping oscillations of synchronous
</p>
<p>machine, it is of interest to recall the analogous phenomena in an LC circuit.
</p>
<p>Figure 21.2 shows an LC circuit with series resistance R, with the voltage step E

Following the voltage step, the voltages and currents in this RLC circuit oscillate
</p>
<p>at frequency o0 &frac14; on sqrt(1 � x2), where x is the damping coefficient of the RLC
circuit. In the case when resistance R is equal to zero, damping coefficient x is equal
</p>
<p>to zero as well, and the frequency of oscillations is equal to o0 &frac14; on &frac14; 1/sqrt(LC);
thus, variation of the voltage across the capacitor C can be represented by

<p>According to the previous equation, the voltage across the capacitor exhibits

</p>
<p>Time constant t &frac14; 2L/R determines the time required for the oscillations amplitude
to decrease by the factor of e &frac14; 2.71. In cases where the time constant t exceeds the
period of oscillations T &frac14; 2p∙sqrt(LC) several times, the oscillations are weakly
damped. Higher values of resistance R result in shorter time constants t, and they
</p>
<p>produce higher values of the damping coefficient x, resulting in a better damping of
</p>
<p>oscillations. Damping coefficient x is equal to the ratio of real part and natural

<p>21.4 Damping of Synchronous Machines
</p>
<p>In order to introduce damping into transient response of synchronous machine, it is
</p>
<p>necessary to provide measures and actions that increase coefficient a which
</p>
<p>multiplies Laplace operator s of characteristic polynomial f(s) &frac14; s2 &thorn; as &thorn; b &frac14;

ton differential equation (21.1) does not have any damping, and it results in
</p>
<p>undamped, sustained oscillations of the power angle d. In order to design damping
</p>
<p>actions, it is of interest to consider the following equation:

magnetic torque. In order to damp oscillations of the synchronous machine

<p>connected to a stiff network, it is necessary to extend the above differential equation
</p>
<p>by adding the torque component proportional to the first derivative of the power
</p>
<p>angle, kP∙dd/dt. This adds the factor kP∙s into characteristic polynomial f(s):

</p>
<p>has the form
</p>
<p>f &eth;s&THORN; &frac14; s2 &thorn; 2xons&thorn; o2n;
</p>
<p>the torque component kP∙dd/dt contributes to damping x &frac14; kP/(2Jon). The required
torque component can be achieved by introducing small variations of the load
</p>
<p>torque. With Tm(t) &frac14; Tm0 � kP dd/dt, it is possible to obtain a stable, well-damped
response of the power angle d and the electromagnetic torque of the synchronous
</p>
<p>machine. Yet, it is very difficult to make such changes of the torque Tm. In
</p>
<p>synchronous generators, the torque TT &frac14; �Tm is provided by the steam or water
turbines, which cannot be controlled with desired dynamics. Synchronous motors
</p>
<p>are loaded by the torque Tm of respective mechanical loads and work machines.
</p>
<p>Neither this torque can include the component kP dd/dt.
</p>
<p>Damping torque kP dd/dt can be obtained from the very synchronous machine,
</p>
<p>provided that the electromagnetic torque Tem included two components, where the
</p>
<p>first is proportional to sin(d) ~ d while the second is proportional to the first time
</p>
<p>derivative of the power angle, dd/dt. Desired variation of the torque is determined
</p>
<p>by expression Tem &frac14; kd &thorn; kP dd/dt.
Electromagnetic torque of an AC machine depends on the flux and also on the
</p>
<p>stator current. On the other hand, the stator current can be changed by altering the
</p>
<p>stator voltages. Therefore, generally speaking, desired variation of electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque can be achieved by changing the stator voltages. With changes in stator
</p>
<p>voltages determined by dd/dt, the stator currents and the electromagnetic torque
</p>
<p>would exhibit changes that depend on dd/dt. However, the subject of this analysis is
</p>
<p>a synchronous machine connected to a stiff network, where the voltages cannot
</p>
<p>change according to dd/dt. Instead, the stator voltages have amplitude and fre-
</p>
<p>quency that do not change. Therefore, the damping torque DTem &frac14; kP dd/dt requires
the change of the machine construction and introduction of a new set of windings.
</p>
<p>21.5 Damper Winding
</p>
<p>Considering that dd/dt &frac14; oe � om, the required damping torque DTem &frac14; kP dd/dt
is proportional to the slip Oe � Om. At steady state, synchronous speed Oe is equal
to the rotor speed Om. During transients caused by the load torque disturbances, the
</p>
<p>21.5 Damper Winding 603</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>rotor speed oscillates around the synchronous speed, which gives rise to a nonzero
</p>
<p>slip oe � om frequency. By adding a short-circuited cage in the rotor of a synchro-
nous machine, it is possible to obtain performance similar to that of an induction
</p>
<p>machine. Squirrel cage rotor of induction machines provides electromagnetic
</p>
<p>torque which is proportional to the slip. The same way, a short-circuited cage
</p>
<p>winding mounted on the rotor of synchronous machine contributes to the torque
</p>
<p>component which is proportional to the first derivative of the power angle
</p>
<p>dd/dt &frac14; oe � om &frac14; ok.
In a synchronous machine with a cylindrical, laminated magnetic circuit of the
</p>
<p>rotor, short-circuited cage winding is inserted in the same way as in induction
</p>
<p>machines. Conductive cage bars are inserted within the rotor magnetic circuit in
</p>
<p>axial direction, next to the rotor surface, in close vicinity of the air gap. At both ends
</p>
<p>of the rotor cylinder, the bars are short-circuited by conductive plates or rings. In
</p>
<p>cases where the rotor magnetic circuit has salient poles, as shown in Fig. 21.5, the
</p>
<p>bars are built into the pole heads. In high-power synchronous generators used in
</p>
<p>thermal power plants, designed to operate with high peripheral speeds, the rotor
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit has elements made of nonlaminated steel, so as to achieve mechan-
</p>
<p>ical robustness in the presence of large centrifugal forces. In such cases, it is not
</p>
<p>necessary to use short-circuited cage on the rotor. During transient response, where
</p>
<p>the difference between the synchronous speedOe and the rotor speedOm contributes
</p>
<p>to the slip frequency oe � om &frac14; ok, magnetic induction within the rotor magnetic
circuit changes and produces eddy currents within the rotor parts made of
</p>
<p>nonlaminated conductive steel. Eddy currents within pieces of homogeneous steel
</p>
<p>create the effect which is the same as the effect made by a short-circuited cage.
</p>
<p>The above considerations propose insertion of a new set of windings on the rotor
</p>
<p>of synchronous machines, called damper winding. This new winding is used to
</p>
<p>suppress the oscillations in synchronous machines supplied from a stiff network.
</p>
<p>The question arises whether this new winding changes the steady state behavior of
</p>
<p>the machine.
</p>
<p>A short-circuited cage in the rotor of synchronous machine does not have any
</p>
<p>impact on the machine operation at steady states. With the stator field which
</p>
<p>revolves in synchronism with the rotor, there is no relative motion between the
</p>
<p>rotor and the field. Therefore, there is no change of magnetic induction within the
</p>
<p>Fig. 21.5 Damper winding
built into heads of the rotor
</p>
<p>poles. Conductive rotor bars
</p>
<p>are short-circuited at both
</p>
<p>sides by conductive plates
</p>
<p>604 21 Transients in Sychronous Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>rotor magnetic circuit. For this reason, the flux of short-circuited cage winding does
</p>
<p>not change, and it produces no electromotive forces. Consequently, there are no
</p>
<p>electrical currents within the cage windings, and no change in the torque and flux.
</p>
<p>Hence, the machine operates in the same way as it would perform without the cage
</p>
<p>winding. During transient processes, where the rotor moves relative to the stator
</p>
<p>field, the first derivative of the power angle is equal tooe � om &frac14; ok 6&frac14; 0. For that
reason, the flux within the cage winding changes, and it produces electromotive
</p>
<p>forces which depend on the slip ok. This electromotive force produces electrical
</p>
<p>currents in short-circuited cage. The angular frequency of these currents is equal to
</p>
<p>dd/dt &frac14; ok. Through the interaction with the magnetic field, the cage currents
contribute to electromagnetic torque which is proportional to the slip, DTem &frac14;
kP dd/dt. This torque does not exist in steady state conditions. The torque DTem
has stabilizing effects, and it contributes to decay of oscillations in synchronous
</p>
<p>machines supplied from stiff networks.
</p>
<p>21.6 Short Circuit of Synchronous Machines
</p>
<p>Large power synchronous generators used in hydro power plants or thermal power
</p>
<p>plants have the rated power from several tens to several hundreds of MW. The line
</p>
<p>voltages across the stator windings range from 6 up to 25 kV. In most cases, each
</p>
<p>generator has its own power transformer, called block transformer. The stator
</p>
<p>terminals are connected to the primary winding of this power transformer. The
</p>
<p>transformer has secondary voltages ranging from 110 up to 700 kV. The secondary
</p>
<p>winding is connected to the three-phase high-voltage transmission network. The
</p>
<p>network extends and reaches large cities and industrial areas, where the high voltage
</p>
<p>is supplied to a set of power transformers which reduce the voltage. Following that,
</p>
<p>distribution networks feed the electrical energy to individual consumers.
</p>
<p>Electrical power system comprises electrical generators, transmission lines, power
</p>
<p>transformers, distribution lines, and also various consumers. It has large size and
</p>
<p>spreads throughoutwhole countries. Consequently, there are quite frequent faults such
</p>
<p>as short circuit, caused by component failures, weather conditions, human error, and
</p>
<p>other reasons. Electrical power systems include a sophisticated protection system
</p>
<p>which detects the short-circuit faults, interrupts the short-circuit currents, and isolates
</p>
<p>the faulty part of the network. Proper functionality of said protection system relies on
</p>
<p>synchronous generators supplying the short-circuit current, so as to enable
</p>
<p>distinguishing the short-circuit event, its type, and location. For that reason, it is of
</p>
<p>interest to study behavior of synchronous machines brought into short circuit.
</p>
<p>When a short circuit occurs on the high-voltage transmission line, next to the
</p>
<p>power plant, the short-circuit current which is fed from synchronous generator is
</p>
<p>directly proportional to the stator electromotive force and inversely proportional to
</p>
<p>the equivalent short-circuit impedance. The latter depends on the series impedance
</p>
<p>of the high-voltage transmission line, on the series impedance of the block trans-
</p>
<p>former, and on the internal impedance of the generator windings.
</p>
<p>21.6 Short Circuit of Synchronous Machines 605</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In a synchronous generator with constant excitation current, and with negligible
</p>
<p>resistance RS, the short-circuit current can be determined from the steady state
</p>
<p>equivalent circuit in Fig. 20.1. It is obtained by dividing the electromotive force
</p>
<p>E0 and the series reactance XS &frac14; oeLS. Excitation winding of large synchronous
generators is supplied from controllable sources of DC voltage which have a finite
</p>
<p>output impedance. Therefore, during the short-circuit transients, the assumption
</p>
<p>iR &frac14; IR &frac14; const. does not hold. Moreover, large synchronous generators also
have sets of damper windings. The presence of damper windings in the rotor of
</p>
<p>synchronous generator reduces its equivalent impedances and increases the short-
</p>
<p>circuit current. More exact calculation of the short-circuit current requires the
</p>
<p>model of synchronous machine to be extended by including short-circuited
</p>
<p>damper windings.
</p>
<p>In Chap. 15, it is shown that the short-circuited cage winding can be modeled by
</p>
<p>a system of two orthogonal short-circuited rotor windings. Complete model of
</p>
<p>synchronous machine with damper windings comprises five coupled windings.
</p>
<p>These five windings are (1) the excitation winding, (2) the stator winding of
</p>
<p>d-axis, (3) the stator winding of q-axis, (4) short-circuited damper winding in
</p>
<p>d-axis, and (5) short-circuited damper winding in q-axis. The use of complete
</p>
<p>model with five coupled windings allows more precise prediction of short-circuit
</p>
<p>currents in the stator winding. This model is relatively complex, and it is not
</p>
<p>developed nor used in this chapter. Instead, an approximate calculation of the
</p>
<p>short-circuit current is proposed which takes into account the impact of the excita-
</p>
<p>tion winding and the impact of the damper winding.
</p>
<p>When a short circuit occurs at terminals of the stator winding, the stator voltage
</p>
<p>drops to US &frac14; 0. In an actual short-circuit condition across the high-voltage
transmission line, the stator voltage is not equal to zero. There is a certain series
</p>
<p>impedance Z1 between the stator terminals and the short-circuit location. The
</p>
<p>analysis of this condition can be simplified by adding the impedance Z1 to the
</p>
<p>stator impedance and considering that US &frac14; 0. This means that the reactance and
resistance of the stator winding are to be increased by the amount corresponding to
</p>
<p>the equivalent series reactance and series resistance between the machine terminals
</p>
<p>and the short-circuit site. In further considerations, it will be assumed that the
</p>
<p>external inductance and resistance which separate the machine from the short-
</p>
<p>circuit site are included in the inductance and resistance of the stator winding.
</p>
<p>With that in mind, further analysis is carried out assuming that the stator winding is
</p>
<p>short-circuited (US &frac14; 0), even in cases where the short circuit occurs along the
high-voltage transmission line.
</p>
<p>The subsequent analysis of short circuits is carried out under assumption that the
</p>
<p>stator current before the fault is equal to zero. In addition, stator resistance RS in
</p>
<p>high-power machines can be neglected; thus, the voltage balance equations take
</p>
<p>the form

<p>Transient processes in a short-circuited synchronous machine include variations
</p>
<p>of the flux components in d- and q-axes. Therefore, it is not justified to assume that
</p>
<p>the machine operates in the steady state, where the first derivatives of the flux
</p>
<p>components in dq coordinate frame are equal to zero. On the other hand, complete
</p>
<p>mathematical model of synchronous machine with stator windings, excitation
</p>
<p>winding, and damper windings is rather complex. In order to obtain an estimate
</p>
<p>of shortcircuit currents, it is of interest to simplify the analysis by introducing
</p>
<p>certain approximations. These approximations are based on the fact that the time
</p>
<p>constants that characterize transient processes in damping cage windings decay
</p>
<p>quickly, while transient processes in excitation winding last longer. Therefore, the
</p>
<p>short-circuit process is split in three intervals:
</p>
<p>&bull; Subtransient interval, where transient processes in damping cage have not ceased
</p>
<p>and where the damping cage current contributes to the short-circuit current.
</p>
<p>&bull; Transient interval that follows subtransient interval and starts after the damping
</p>
<p>cage currents has decayed to zero.
</p>
<p>&bull; Steady state interval, which follows after the transient phenomena in both
</p>
<p>damping and excitation winding have ceased and where the short-circuit current
</p>
<p>can be determined from the steady state equivalent circuit in Fig. 20.1.
</p>
<p>21.6.1 DC Component
</p>
<p>The steady state operation of electrical circuits with AC currents and voltages can
</p>
<p>be disturbed by stepwise changes of voltage or current sources, by changing the
</p>
<p>circuit impedance, or by introducing short circuits or open circuits. Whenever such
</p>
<p>transients occur, the process of passing from the previous steady state condition into
</p>
<p>a new steady state condition may involve a certain amount of DC current that exists
</p>
<p>during transients and that decays as the circuit enters the new steady state condition.
</p>
<p>Well-known example involves connecting the coil of the self-inductance L to a
</p>
<p>voltage source uL(t) &frac14; Um sin(ot) at instant t &frac14; 0, where iL(0) &frac14; 0. The coil
current for t &gt; 0 is equal to iL(t) &frac14; (Um/L/o)∙(1 � cos(ot)), and it contains a DC
component. In coils with a finite resistance R, this DC current decays with the time
</p>
<p>constant of t &frac14; L/R. Similar processes take place in short-circuited synchronous
machines.
</p>
<p>During short circuit of the stator winding, the phase voltages are equal to zero.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the voltage balance equation in phase a is ua &frac14; 0 &frac14; RSia &thorn; dCa/dt. In
large synchronous machine, the voltage drop RSia is very small. Therefore, equation
</p>
<p>reduces to dCa/dt &frac14; 0, meaning that the flux in each phase tends to retain the value
Ca(0
</p>
<p>�) which corresponds to the flux at the instant of making the short circuit.
Therefore, it is assumed that the flux in short-circuited windings remains constant
</p>
<p>during the short-circuit fault. Even large power synchronous machines have a finite
</p>
<p>value of the stator resistance RS &gt; 0. Although very small, the voltage RSia
does influence the winding flux, in particular, over longer intervals of time.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Considering that the short circuits are of limited duration, the assumption dCa/
</p>
<p>dt &frac14; 0 can be successfully used to facilitate calculation of short-circuit currents.
During steady state operation before the short circuit, the flux in phase a varies as
</p>
<p>sinusoidal function of the frequency om &frac14; oe. The average value of the flux Ca
prior to the short circuit is equal to zero. At the instant of the short circuit, the value
</p>
<p>of flux is Ca &frac14; Ca(0�). If the voltage drop RSia is negligible, the flux in phase a
retains the value Ca(0
</p>
<p>�) during the short-circuit conditions. Therefore, flux Ca
comprises a DC component. Due to the presence of a small but finite voltage drop
</p>
<p>RSia, the DC component of the flux exponentially decays. The time constant t &frac14;
LgeS/RS determines the rate of change of the DC component, and it depends on the
</p>
<p>equivalent inductance LgeS and the stator resistance RS. Larger values of the winding
</p>
<p>resistance result in quicker decay of DC component. Detailed analysis of changes in
</p>
<p>the machine torque, speed, and ab and dq variables that are caused by the DC
</p>
<p>component of the stator flux requires evaluation of the complete mathematical
</p>
<p>model. This model includes the damping cage windings, and it is rather involved
</p>
<p>and difficult to evaluate. Therefore, further considerations are based on the assump-
</p>
<p>tion that the time constant t &frac14; LgeS/RS is relatively small and that the DC
components of the stator flux decay rather quickly. With DC component decay
</p>
<p>time significantly shorter than the duration of the short-circuit phenomena, it is
</p>
<p>possible to neglect the DC component and to assume that the initial value of the flux
</p>
<p>is equal to zero. With that in mind, the initial value of the phase flux linkages at the
</p>
<p>short-circuit instant is given by equations Ca(0

<p>The purpose of this discussion is to obtain an approximate change of the short-
</p>
<p>circuit current. The analysis is simplified by the assumption that Cd(0
+) &frac14; Cq(0+)
</p>
<p>&frac14; 0. The assumption will be used in calculating the short-circuit current ISC.
The short-circuit current is affected by the value of the excitation current IR at
</p>
<p>the instant of the short circuit and on the values of the stator currents at the same
</p>
<p>instant. The short-circuit current of synchronous machine that was running with no
</p>
<p>load prior to the fault is different than the short-circuit current of loaded machine. In
</p>
<p>order to keep the analysis simple, the subsequent steps consider the situation where
</p>
<p>the short circuit occurs while the machine is not loaded. Hence, the stator currents
</p>
<p>are equal to zero in the wake of the short circuit, resulting in id(0
�) &frac14; 0 and
</p>
<p>iq(0
�) &frac14; 0. Notwithstanding the abovementioned assumptions, the subsequent
</p>
<p>analysis helps the reader understand the basic intervals of short-circuit transients,
</p>
<p>and it also provides the means to obtain a rough estimate of the short-circuit
</p>
<p>currents in each interval:
</p>
<p>&bull; During subtransient interval, both the damping cage and the excitation winding
</p>
<p>contribute to short-circuit current ISC3.
</p>
<p>&bull; In the following transient interval, the cage currents have ceased, and the short-
</p>
<p>circuit current ISC2 is aided by the excitation winding.
</p>
<p>&bull; Steady state short-circuit current ISC1 is calculated assuming that transient
</p>
<p>processes in the excitation winding have ended and that the excitation current
</p>
<p>IR is constant.

<p>Within the subsequent considerations, the short-circuit current ISC1 is calculated
</p>
<p>first, assuming that the excitation current iR(t) &frac14; IR does not change. In calculation
of ISC1, it is justifiable to consider that the excitation winding is supplied from a
</p>
<p>current source and that the machine does not have damping cage.
</p>
<p>Then, the short-circuit current ISC2 is calculated, considering transient phenom-
</p>
<p>ena in the excitation winding which is supplied from the voltage source.
</p>
<p>Finally, the short-circuit current ISC3 is calculated by taking into account the
</p>
<p>impact of transient processes in damping cage and transient processes in excitation
</p>
<p>winding on the current in short-circuited stator windings.
</p>
<p>21.6.2 Calculation of ISC1
</p>
<p>It is of interest to calculate the short-circuit current ISC1 which exists in the stator
</p>
<p>windings when the transient processes in other windings have decayed and when
</p>
<p>the excitation current iR(t) &frac14; IR does not change. In this calculation, it is justifiable
to assume that the damper winding does not exist and that the excitation winding is
</p>
<p>supplied from the current source.2 Considering condition Cd &frac14; Cq &frac14; 0, relations
Lqiq &frac14; 0 and Ldid &thorn; LmIP &frac14; 0 are obtained for a synchronous machine which does
not have damper windings.3 Components of the current ISC1 are given by (21.3),

(21.3)
</p>
<p>Therefore, the rms value of the short-circuit current is 0.707∙ISC1 &frac14; 0.707E0/Xd.
When the short-circuit fault persists, the current ISC1 does not decay in time, and it
</p>
<p>is retained in the stator winding until the short circuit is disconnected. Instantaneous
</p>
<p>values of the corresponding phase currents can be obtained by applying the inverse
</p>
<p>Park and inverse 3F/2F transform to the components obtained in (21.3).
</p>
<p>2Excitation windings of large synchronous machines are supplied from adjustable sources of DC
</p>
<p>voltage. The source voltage is used as the driving force which is used to control the excitation
</p>
<p>current. At the wake of the short circuit event, the changes in the excitation voltage can be
</p>
<p>neglected, and it is justifiable to assume that the excitation winding is supplied from the voltage
</p>
<p>source that provides a constant voltage. Later on, as the transient phenomena decay while the short
</p>
<p>circuit persists, it is justifiable to assume that the excitation current is constant, namely, that the
</p>
<p>excitation winding is supplied from a source of constant current.
3 In the considered case, the machine is equipped by damper windings, but the transient processes
</p>
<p>in these windings have ceased, and the electrical currents in damper windings are equal to zero.

<p>21.6.3 Calculation of ISC2
</p>
<p>The excitation winding of large synchronous machines is supplied either from an
</p>
<p>auxiliary DC generator, which provides adjustable excitation voltage and which is
</p>
<p>called exciter, or from a static power converter with large thyristors, which converts
</p>
<p>the three-phase AC voltages into adjustable DC voltage. Both the exciter machine
</p>
<p>and the static power converter can be modeled as a DC voltage source which
</p>
<p>provides adjustable voltage, and which has a finite, relatively low internal resistance.
</p>
<p>The excitation voltage is adjusted by the excitation controller. As the shortcircuit
</p>
<p>takes place all of a sudden, the excitation voltage remains constant for a while,
</p>
<p>and it retains the value UR &frac14; RRIR that existed before the short circuit. Notice that
IR denotes the value of the excitation current prior to the short circuit, while iR(t)
</p>
<p>denotes the change of the excitation current during the transients.
</p>
<p>The excitation winding is magnetically coupled to the stator winding, which is
</p>
<p>short-circuited. Due to a finite mutual inductance between the stator windings and
</p>
<p>the excitation winding, the short-circuit stator currents affect the mutual flux. With
</p>
<p>the excitation winding supplied from a voltage source, these changes introduce
</p>
<p>variation in the excitation current. Assuming that the voltage drop UR &frac14; RRIR
across the resistance of the excitation winding is relatively small, the voltage
</p>
<p>balance equation for the excitation winding reduces to the expression dCR/
</p>
<p>dt &frac14; 0. Therefore, with excitation winding supplied from the voltage source, and
with RRIR � 0, the flux CR &frac14; LRiR &thorn; Lmid retains the value LRIR which existed
prior to the short-circuit fault.
</p>
<p>On the bases of the previous considerations, the stator flux components maintain
</p>
<p>the valuesCd(0
+) &frac14; Cq(0
</p>
<p>+) &frac14; 0 throughout the short-circuit transients. One part of
the stator flux encircles the excitation winding. The axis d of synchronous dq frame
</p>
<p>coincides with magnetic axis of the excitation winding. Therefore, condition
</p>
<p>Cd(0
+) &frac14; 0 reduces the flux in the excitation winding. Variation of the flux in the
</p>
<p>excitation winding causes induction of an electromotive force which acts toward
</p>
<p>increasing the excitation current iR(t), in an attempt to suppress the reduction in the
</p>
<p>excitation flux and to maintain the flux linkage that existed prior to the short circuit.
</p>
<p>Neglecting the voltage drop RRiR in the voltage balance equation for the excitation
</p>
<p>winding, it is reasonable to assume that the relation dCR/dt � 0 holds for relatively
short intervals of time. With that in mind, the excitation flux CR tends to retain the

<p>value CR0 that existed prior to the short-circuit fault. Therefore,

<p>ISC2 which exists in the stator phase windings during the transient interval of the

(21.7)
</p>
<p>The short-circuit current ISC2 during transient interval is larger than the steady
</p>
<p>state short-circuit current ISC1, due to the fact that transient processes in the
</p>
<p>excitation winding contribute to the short-circuit current. If the short circuit persists
</p>
<p>as the transient processes in the excitation winding decay, the transient current ISC2
reduces toward the steady state value ISC1.
</p>
<p>Negative value of the stator current component id contributes to an increase in
</p>
<p>the excitation current iR, which tends to maintain the excitation flux at the value
</p>
<p>which existed before the short-circuit event. Since the excitation voltage does not
</p>
<p>change, the voltage balance equation in the excitation winding has the form UR &frac14;
RRIR &frac14; RRiR &thorn; dCR/dt. During transient processes, the first derivative of the exci-
tation flux is negative, dCR/dt &frac14; RR(IR � iR) &lt; 0, and therefore, the excitation flux
reduces. Reduction of the excitation flux reduces the electromotive force induced in
</p>
<p>the stator winding. As a consequence, the short-circuit current in the stator windings
</p>
<p>is reduced as well.
</p>
<p>The change of the excitation flux and the excitation current during transient
</p>
<p>interval can be analyzed on the bases of equivalent circuit obtained from Fig. 21.6
</p>
<p>and shown in Fig. 21.7, where the stator resistances are removed while the stator
</p>
<p>winding is short-circuited.
</p>
<p>The above RL circuit is characterized by the time constant t0 &frac14; Le0/RR0 which
determines the exponential change of electrical currents in the circuit. Parameter Le

<p>T/t0, exponential decay within one period of stator currents can be approximated by
the expression exp(�T/t0) � 1 � T/t0 � 1. The stator currents during short circuit
can be regarded as sinusoidal, with an amplitude that decays exponentially.
</p>
<p>From the previous analysis, it is possible to obtain the change of the short-circuit
</p>
<p>current in a synchronous machine with no damping cage winding and with voltage-
</p>
<p>supplied excitation winding. In absence of the damper windings, the short-circuit
</p>
<p>phenomena do not have subtransient interval. During the transient interval, imme-
</p>
<p>diately upon the short circuits is established, the amplitude of the stator phase
</p>
<p>current is ISC2 (21.7). It decays exponentially and reaches the steady state value
</p>
<p>ISC1. The change of the current amplitude is determined by the time constant t&rsquo;. The
</p>
<p>actual change of the phase current ia(t) depends on the initial phase of the stator
</p>
<p>voltages prior to the short circuit, on the instant of establishing the short circuit, and
</p>
<p>also on the circuit resistances that have been neglected. As an example, the phase
</p>

<p>The analysis performed above takes into account dynamic phenomena in d-axis.
</p>
<p>In the considered case, the currents and fluxes in q-axis were equal to zero prior to the
</p>
<p>short circuit. The accuracy in calculating the short-circuit currents can be further
</p>
<p>enhanced by taking into account the coupling of transient processes d-axis and
</p>
<p>q-axis. The coupling between transient phenomena in orthogonal axes can be
</p>
<p>understood from differential equations expressing the voltage balance in virtual
</p>
<p>d-winding and q-winding. It has to be noted at this point that the q-axis does not have
</p>
<p>magnetic coupling with the excitation winding. The rotor of synchronous machines
</p>
<p>comprises only one excitation winding, and this winding has magnetic axis aligned
</p>
<p>with d-axis of the dq coordinate frame. For this reason, (21.3) and (21.7) provide an
</p>
<p>adequate approximation of the short-circuit current during transient and steady state

<p>The presence of short-circuited damping cage increases the amplitude of the short-

<p>Any flux change results in induced electromotive forces and electrical currents in

<p>short-circuited windings that oppose to the flux change and act toward retaining the

<p>to zero, the damper windings act toward maintaining the flux. With larger flux, the
</p>
<p>stator electromotive forces are larger, which results in an increased amplitude of the

<p>The damper windings can be represented by two orthogonal short-circuited
</p>
<p>windings, one aligned with d-axis and the other aligned with q-axis. Adding the
</p>
<p>short-circuited rotor cage to the machine described in the previous example, the
</p>
<p>machine model in synchronously rotating dq coordinate frame obtains three
</p>
<p>windings that are aligned with d-axis. One of them is virtual stator phase in
</p>
<p>d-axis, the second is the excitation winding, while the third is the damper winding
</p>
<p>aligned with d-axis. The flux of the stator winding in d-axis is denoted by Cd, the
</p>
<p>excitation flux byCR, while the flux of the short-circuited damper winding of d-axis
</p>
<p>is denoted by CD.
</p>
<p>The three coupled windings residing in d-axis resemble a transformer with
</p>
<p>primary, secondary, and tertiary winding. The primary is the stator winding,
</p>
<p>while the secondary and tertiary windings are the excitation winding and the
</p>
<p>damper winding of d-axis. Considerations and assumptions adopted for transient
</p>
<p>interval of the short circuit are valid for subtransient interval as well. Namely, ISC3
calculation can be based on the assumption that the excitation winding and the
</p>
<p>damper winding are short-circuited throughout the subtransient interval. The equiv-
</p>
<p>alent transformer is shown in Fig. 21.8, and its secondary and tertiary windings are

<p>The short-circuit current ISC3 during the first, subtransient interval can be

<p>determined from the inductance L

</p>
<p>subtransient inductance corresponds to the equivalent primary inductance of the

<p>Subtransient inductance L

d can be determined by using the inductance matrix
</p>
<p>and comparing the flux values before the short-circuit event and after the short-
</p>
<p>circuit event. In order to determine the initial value of the short-circuit current ISC3,
</p>
<p>it is necessary to define the flux values Cd(0

</p>
<p>�), and CD(0
�) before the
</p>
<p>short circuit as well as the flux values Cd(0
+), CR(0
</p>
<p>+), and CD(0
+) immediately
</p>
<p>after the short circuit.
</p>
<p>Preliminary assumptions in this short-circuit analysis are that the initial values of
</p>
<p>the stator currents are equal to zero (id(0
�) &frac14; iq(0�) &frac14; 0) and that the excitation

<p>current is equal to the steady state value IR0 (iR(0

</p>
<p>equal to the synchronous speed (om &frac14; oe), while the electrical current of the d-axis
damper winding is equal to zero (iD(0

while the excitation winding is connected to a voltage source of a relatively low
</p>
<p>internal resistance. Neglecting the resistance RR of the excitation winding, it is
</p>
<p>justifiable to assume that both the excitation voltage RRIR0 and the voltage drop
</p>
<p>RRiR are negligible and that the excitation winding is short-circuited during the
</p>
<p>subtransient interval, as well as the damper winding.
</p>
<p>Electromotive forces induced in short-circuited windings tend to maintain the
</p>
<p>winding flux. Any flux changes results in induced electromotive forces and conse-
</p>
<p>quential currents that oppose to flux changes and suppress any rapid change of the
</p>
<p>flux. Therefore, the flux linkages at the wake of the short circuit are CD(0

</p>
<p>The initial flux of the stator winding was discussed while considering transient

<p>interval and steady state short circuit, and it was pointed out that the initial value of
</p>
<p>the stator flux is to be considered equal to zero. In this way, calculation of the short-

<p>With negligible voltage drop RSiS, the voltage balance in the stator phase a
</p>
<p>following the short-circuit event reduces to dCa/dt &frac14; 0. Therefore, the stator flux
retains the value Ca(0
</p>
<p>�); hence, Ca(0
+) &frac14; Ca(0�). In a hypothetical case where
</p>
<p>RS &frac14; 0 and where the stator winding is short-circuited, the stator flux Ca retains
the initial value indefinitely. Since the stator resistance has a small but finite value,
</p>
<p>the voltage drop across the stator resistance acts toward reducing the flux in short-
</p>
<p>circuited stator winding. Depending on the short-circuit instant, the stator flux and
</p>
<p>current retain a certain initial value that can be regarded as a DC component. This
</p>
<p>DC component decays exponentially. The time constant of this exponential decay
</p>
<p>is shorter for larger values of the stator resistance. Eventually, the DC components
</p>
<p>of the stator currents and flux linkages cease, while the AC component of the short
</p>
<p>circuit remains at an amplitude determined by the electromotive forces and
</p>
<p>reactances of the machine. The AC component of the short-circuit current is
</p>
<p>considered of primary interest. Therefore, the impact of the initial DC component
</p>
<p>on the rms and peak values of the short-circuit stator currents are neglected in this
</p>
<p>analysis. For this reason, it is justifiable to assume that the initial values of the
</p>
<p>stator flux linkages at the instant of the short circuit are equal to zero. The
</p>
<p>subsequent analysis starts with the assumption that the initial flux of the stator
</p>
<p>phases reduces quickly from the initial valuesCa(0
�),Cb(0
</p>
<p>�), andCc(0
�) down to
</p>
<p>zero. On that grounds, it is assumed that Ca(0

</p>
<p>results in Cd(0

<p>The above expression is relatively complex and needs to be elaborated. Without

<p>the lack of generality, it is possible to refer all the inductances to the stator side, by

<p>the number of turns in relevant windings.
</p>
<p>Mutual flux of the three windings passes through the same magnetic circuit of

<p>winding to the stator side actually means representing these windings by

<p>equivalents which have the same number of turns as the stator winding. Therefore,

<p>The previous analysis shows that electrical currents induced in the damper

exponential decay of damping currents depends on the resistance RD

<p>Transferred to the stator side, the damping resistance R0D is larger than the
</p>
<p>resistance of the excitation winding. Therefore, the subtransient time constant t00
</p>
<p>is shorter than the transient time constant t0. Therefore, the short-circuit event in
</p>
<p>synchronous machines has three intervals. It begins with a brief subtransient
</p>
<p>interval, proceeds with somewhat longer transient interval, and, unless interrupted,
</p>
<p>enters the steady state short-circuit interval. The three intervals are discussed
</p>
<p>below.
</p>
<p>21.7 Transient and Subtransient Phenomena
</p>
<p>21.7.1 Interval 1
</p>
<p>The first interval of the short circuit is subtransient interval, which starts immedi-
</p>
<p>ately after the instant of establishing the short-circuit conditions. The current of the
</p>
<p>amplitude ISC3 is established in the stator windings. This current is directly propor-
</p>
<p>tional to the excitation current and inversely proportional to the subtransient
</p>
<p>inductance of the machine, denoted by L
00
</p>
<p>d. Subtransient current decays exponen-
</p>
<p>tially with the subtransient time constant t00. After several intervals of t00, the current
</p>
<p>amplitude reduces to ISC2. At the end of subtransient interval, transient processes in
</p>
<p>damper winding have decayed, and damping currents have reduced to zero. At this
</p>
<p>point, the damper windings cease to make any contribution to short-circuit currents.
</p>
<p>21.7.2 Interval 2
</p>
<p>During the second interval, called transient interval, the amplitude of short-circuit
</p>
<p>currents in the stator windings is ISC2. This current is directly proportional to the
</p>
<p>excitation current and inversely proportional to transient inductance of the machine
</p>
<p>L
0
</p>
<p>d. The current amplitude decays exponentially with the time constant t
0. After
</p>
<p>several transient time constant t0, the amplitude of the stator currents reduces to ISC1.
</p>
<p>618 21 Transients in Sychronous Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>At the end of transient interval, transient processes in the excitation winding have
</p>
<p>decayed, and the excitation current settles to the steady state value IR0 &frac14; UR/RR.
At this point, the excitation winding does not have any transient currents which
</p>
<p>contribute to short-circuit currents in the stator windings.
</p>
<p>21.7.3 Interval 3
</p>
<p>After subtransient and transient interval, transient processes in the excitation
</p>
<p>winding and the damper windings decay. Damping currents reduce to zero, while
</p>
<p>the excitation current settles on the steady state value. At this point, the short-circuit
</p>
<p>current can be determined from the steady state equivalent circuit in Fig. 20.1.
</p>
<p>The steady state short-circuit current in the stator winding has amplitude ISC1,which
</p>
<p>is directly proportional to the excitation current and inversely proportional to the
</p>
<p>stator inductance Ld � Lm. This amplitude does not change until protection
mechanisms are activated to disconnect the stator winding from the short circuit.
</p>
<p>Interval 1 is commonly called subtransient interval, and the reactance X
00
</p>
<p>d &frac14;
omL
</p>
<p>00
</p>
<p>d is called subtransient reactance. Interval 2 is called transient interval, while
</p>
<p>reactance X
0
</p>
<p>d &frac14; omL
0
</p>
<p>d is called transient reactance. Expressions for the short-
</p>
<p>circuit currents in transient and subtransient intervals are obtained by adopting a
</p>
<p>series of approximations aimed to simplify calculations and to make the basic short-
</p>
<p>circuit behavior more obvious. Expressions such as (21.12, 21.13, and 21.14) are
</p>
<p>relatively simple, and they give an insight into the impact of the machine
</p>
<p>parameters on the amplitude and dynamic behavior of the short-circuit current.
</p>
<p>More precise calculations require solving the complete mathematical model of
</p>
<p>synchronous machine which comprises five magnetically coupled windings.
</p>
<p>In synchronous generators, practical relative values of synchronous reactance xd
range from 0.8 up to 2. Relative values of transient reactance x
</p>
<p>0
</p>
<p>d range from 0.2 up
</p>
<p>to 0.5, while relative values of subtransient reactance range from 0.1 up to 0.3.
</p>
<p>Transient time constant t0 has values from 400 ms up to 2 s, while subtransient
</p>
<p>interval t00 runs from 30 to 150 ms.

<p>Variable Frequency Synchronous Machines
</p>
<p>This chapter studies the operation and characteristics of three-phase synchronous
</p>
<p>machines connected to three-phase inverters, static power converters capable of
</p>
<p>adjusting the stator voltages by means of changing the width of the voltage pulses
</p>
<p>supplied to the stator terminals. The average voltage of the pulse train is adjusted to
</p>
<p>suit the machine needs. Variable speed operation of synchronous machine is
</p>
<p>achieved with variable frequency and variable amplitude of stator voltages. This
</p>
<p>chapter introduces and explains some basic torque and speed control principles.
</p>
<p>The need of controlling the stator currents is discussed and explained. Fundamental
</p>
<p>principles of stator current control are introduced, relying on PWM-controlled
</p>
<p>three-phase inverter as the voltage actuator. Field-weakening performance of
</p>
<p>inverter-supplied synchronous machines with buried magnets and surface-mounted
</p>
<p>magnets is analyzed and explained. The limits of constant power operation in field-
</p>
<p>weakening mode are determined, explained, and expressed in terms of the stator
</p>
<p>self-inductance. Based upon the study of operating limits of the machine and
</p>
<p>operating limits of associated three-phase inverter, steady-state operating area
</p>
<p>and transient operating area are derived in T � O plane and studied for inverter-
supplied synchronous machines.
</p>
<p>22.1 Inverter-Supplied Synchronous Machines
</p>
<p>Synchronous machines of low and medium power are used in applications such as
</p>
<p>motion control, vehicle propulsion, industrial robots, or production machines.
</p>
<p>In these applications, synchronous machines have task to overcome motion resis-
</p>
<p>tance and provide the required acceleration and deceleration of moving parts.
</p>
<p>Synchronous motor is used as an actuator which develops the torque required to
</p>
<p>control the speed or position and to overcome the motion resistances while driving

<p>the controlled object along predefined trajectories. Synchronous motors are better
</p>
<p>suited to these tasks than the other electrical motors. Advantages of synchronous
</p>
<p>machines over the other types of electrical machines include their high specific
</p>
<p>power, high specific torque, a low inertia, and relatively low losses. Synchronous
</p>
<p>machines with permanent magnet excitation have no rotor windings and no rotor
</p>
<p>losses. Therefore, energy efficiency of these motors is considerably improved
</p>
<p>over other types of motors. With permanent magnets, the rotor flux is obtained
</p>
<p>without power losses such as URIR &frac14; RRIR2, encountered in machines which have
the excitation winding. Moreover, there are no iron losses in the rotor magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit of synchronous machine. Due to synchronous rotation of the rotor and the
</p>
<p>stator field, there are no pulsations of magnetic induction B in magnetic circuit of
</p>
<p>the rotor.
</p>
<p>With no rotor losses and no heat generated within the rotor, the cooling of
</p>
<p>permanent magnet synchronous machines is greatly simplified, and it is possible
</p>
<p>to reach larger current densities in the stator winding and larger magnetic induction,
</p>
<p>which results in higher specific power.1 Compared to an induction machine of the
</p>
<p>same rated power, synchronous machine with permanent magnets has 20&ndash;30%
</p>
<p>lower mass and volume. The power balance charts drawn for induction machines
</p>
<p>and synchronous machines have the same losses in the stator winding, in the stator
</p>
<p>magnetic circuit, and in the mechanical subsystem. Induction machines have power
</p>
<p>losses in the rotor which are equal to sPd, where s is relative slip while Pd is the
</p>
<p>air-gap power. Synchronous machines do not have the losses sPd, and this greatly
</p>
<p>increases their energy efficiency.
</p>
<p>In applications suchasmotioncontrol, vehicle propulsion, and industry automation,
</p>
<p>it is required to provide continuous change of the rotor speed. In synchronous
</p>
<p>machines, the rotor speed corresponds to the synchronous speed Oe &frac14; poe, which
is determined by the supply frequency oe. For this reason, synchronous motors in
</p>
<p>motion control applications have to be supplied from separate power sources that
</p>
<p>produce three-phase voltages of variable frequency and variable amplitude, in
</p>
<p>accordance with the motor needs. Two synchronous motors within the same indus-
</p>
<p>trial robot or electrical vehicle most often rotate at different rotor speeds. Therefore,
</p>
<p>eachmotor has its own supply frequency, and it requires a separate power source that
</p>
<p>provides the stator voltages and currents of desired frequency. Such power sources
</p>
<p>are usually three-phase inverters with transistor power switches. Commutation of
</p>
<p>power transistors produces a train of variable width voltage pulses. The pulse width
</p>
<p>of these pulses affects the average voltage within one commutation period.
</p>
<p>By sinusoidal change of the pulse width, the average voltage exhibits sinusoidal
</p>
<p>change with an adjustable amplitude and frequency. Pulse-width-modulation
</p>
<p>techniques enable generation of pulse trains of an average value that corresponds
</p>
<p>to the motor needs.
</p>
<p>1 Specific power is the quotient of the rated power of the machine and the machine volume or
</p>
<p>weight. Similar definition holds for specific torque.

<p>22.2 Torque Control Principles
</p>
<p>In applications where the speed or position of the moving object is controlled and
</p>
<p>enforced to track some predefined trajectory, synchronous permanent magnet
</p>
<p>motors are used as torque actuators, executive organs that provide the driving
</p>
<p>torque that overcomes the motion resistances and forces the speed or position to
</p>
<p>maintain desired reference values. Speed regulators and position regulators calcu-
</p>
<p>late the difference between the controlled variable Om (ym) and its reference value
</p>
<p>O* (y *), and they calculate the electromagnetic torque Tem
* required to remove the
</p>
<p>error DO &frac14; O* � Om and drive the controlled variable back into the reference
track. The speed change is determined by Newton equation of motion, J dOm/
</p>
<p>dt &frac14; Tem � Tm, where Tm denotes the load torque disturbance, while Tem denotes
the electromagnetic torque provided by the synchronous motor. The motor torque
</p>
<p>Tem has to overcome the load torque Tm and to provide the acceleration dOm/dt
</p>
<p>which is needed to achieve desired speed change. While the speed (position)
</p>
<p>regulator calculates the torque reference signal Tem
*, the synchronous permanent
</p>
<p>magnet motor has the task of providing the actual shaft torque Tem which
</p>
<p>corresponds to this reference signal. The speed and accuracy of motion control
</p>
<p>rely on the torque actuator capability of providing the torque which corresponds to
</p>
<p>the reference. In other words, the electromagnetic torque has to track the reference
</p>
<p>Tem
* accurately and with negligible delay, resulting in Tem
</p>
<p>* &frac14; Tem.
In Chap. 19, it has been shown that the electromagnetic torque of synchronous

</p>
<p>when id &frac14; 0, that is, when the stator current vector is aligned with q-axis. In this case,
the rotor flux vector and the stator current vector are displaced by p/2.
</p>
<p>Since the flux CRm of permanent magnets does not change, the torque of
</p>
<p>permanent magnet synchronous motor is controlled by changing the stator current

</p>
<p>with their dq components id &frac14; 0 and iq &frac14; (2/(3p)) ∙ Tem*/CRm &frac14; K ∙ Tem*. The
torque control of permanent magnet synchronous motor is accomplished by
</p>
<p>regulating the stator current and delivering the stator current component iq so that
</p>
<p>it corresponds to the desired torque. The speed and accuracy in delivering desired
</p>
<p>torque are uniquely defined by the speed and accuracy in regulation of the stator
</p>
<p>current. Current regulation relies on supplying the stator winding from the three-
</p>
<p>phase inverter, static power converter which employs switching power transistors in

<p>inverter supplies the stator winding of a synchronous motor. The mains voltages uR,
</p>
<p>uS, and uT are rectified within the diode rectifier that makes use of six power diodes.
</p>
<p>The rectifier provides the DC voltage E which exists in intermediate circuit also
</p>
<p>called DC link circuit. The elements LDC and CDC serve as the filter that removes
</p>
<p>AC components from the rectifier output. Braking unit with transistor QK and
</p>
<p>resistor RK serves to reduce the DC voltage E in braking intervals, when the
</p>
<p>motor operates as generator which passes the braking power back into the DC
</p>
<p>link, charging the DC link capacitor and increasing the DC link voltage. The
</p>
<p>braking energy cannot be returned to the mains due to the nature of the three-
</p>
<p>phase diode rectifier. Therefore, the breaking power gets dissipated in the resistor
</p>
<p>RK. Six power transistors Q1&ndash;Q6 are commutated in order to obtain pulse-shaped
</p>
<p>phase voltages. The state of the power transistor switches is determined so as to
</p>
<p>drive the three-phase currents toward their reference values ia
*(t), ib
</p>
<p>*(t), and ic
*(t).
</p>
<p>The problem of current control in three-phase motors requires more detailed
</p>
<p>study, and it is beyond the scope of this chapter. For this reason, only some basic
</p>
<p>information and principles are presented in further text.
</p>
<p>It is of interest to determine the reference values for the phase currents of a

<p>synchronous permanent magnet motor with flux CRm, with the rotor position equal

<p>result in the stator phase currents ia(t) &frac14; ia*(t), ib(t) &frac14; ib*(t), and ic(t) &frac14; ic*(t). They
produce the stator current vector with projections id &frac14; 0 and iq &frac14; (2/3) ∙ Tem*/CRm
on the axes of synchronous d&ndash;q coordinate frame. In turn, the motor delivers the
</p>
<p>electromagnetic torque Tem &frac14; Tem*.
</p>
<p>22.3 Current Control Principles
</p>
<p>Basic topology of static power converter intended to supply three-phase motor is
</p>
<p>given in Fig. 22.1. By switching action of power transistors Q1&ndash;Q6, it is possible to
</p>
<p>change the phase voltage supplied to the stator winding. The phase voltages ua, ub,
</p>
<p>and uc affect corresponding phase currents, thus providing the grounds for the
</p>
<p>current control. The aim of the current control is obtaining the current components
</p>
<p>id and iq that correspond to desired values. Current component id does not contribute
</p>
<p>to the torque, and it is mostly set to zero. Desired torque is obtained by establishing
</p>
<p>current component iq in proportion to the desired torque. With rotor flux vector
</p>
<p>collinear with d-axis, and with id &frac14; 0, the vector of the stator current is orthogonal
to the flux. Further discussion outlines the basic principles of setting current
</p>
<p>components id and iq to desired values.
</p>
<p>The current components in d&ndash;q coordinate frame are uniquely defined by the
</p>
<p>phase currents ia, ib, and ic. The problem of obtaining desired current components id
and iq is therefore equivalent to the problem of controlling the phase currents. The
</p>
<p>reference values of the phase currents ia
*, ib
</p>
<p>*, and ic
* are calculated in (22.1), and
</p>
<p>they depend on the torque reference Tem
* and the rotor position ym. The torque
</p>
<p>reference comes from the speed controller or the position controller, while the rotor
</p>
<p>position is usually measured by the sensor attached to the rotor shaft. By setting the
</p>
<p>phase currents according to (22.1), resulting vector of the stator current is perpen-
</p>
<p>dicular to the vector of the rotor flux.
</p>
<p>Within the current controller in Fig. 22.1, measured phase currents ia, ib, and ic
are compared to corresponding reference values in order to obtain the errors Dia,
</p>
<p>Dib, and Dic. Based upon these errors, the current controller generates gating signals
</p>
<p>that commutate transistor power switches. This changes the phase voltages in the
</p>
<p>way which reduces the errors and eventually drives them toward zero. Ideally, the
</p>
<p>current controller achieves the operation with ia(t) &frac14; ia*(t), ib(t) &frac14; ib*(t), and
ic(t) &frac14; ic*(t).
</p>
<p>There are six switching power transistors in a three-phase inverter. The switches
</p>
<p>are grouped in three phases, each one generating one of the phase voltages. The
</p>
<p>inverter is supplied by DC voltage E, obtained from the DC link circuit. By turning
</p>
<p>on the upper switch in one of the phases, the output phase is connected to the
</p>
<p>positive plate of the DC link capacitor CDC. By turning on the lower switch, the
</p>
<p>output phase is connected to the negative plate of the DC link capacitor CDC.
</p>
<p>Assuming that the phase windings are star connected, and that the star point has
</p>
<p>the potential in between the capacitor plates, turning on the upper or lower switch
</p>
<p>results in the phase voltage of&thorn;E/2 or�E/2. Hence, by turning on the upper switch
</p>
<p>626 22 Variable Frequency Synchronous Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Q1 of phase a, the phase voltage ua(t) becomes &thorn;E/2, while turning on the lower
switch Q2 results in ua(t) &frac14; �E/2.
</p>
<p>During one commutation period of T � 100 ms, the upper switch in phase a is
closed (on) during time interval tON, while in the remaining part of the commutation
</p>
<p>period, T � tON, the upper switch is opened (off) while the lower switch is closed
(on). The phase voltage ua(t) is equal to +E/2 during time interval tON, and then it
</p>
<p>remains �E/2 for the rest of the period (T � tON). The width tON of the positive
pulse can be varied continuously within the range 0 &lt; tON &lt; T. The average value
of the phase voltage during one period T is equal to ua(av) &frac14; E ∙ (tON/T � 1/2).
Continuous change of the pulse width tON results in continuous change in the
</p>
<p>average value of the phase voltage which ranges between �E/2 and &thorn;E/2. Varia-
tion of the instantaneous value of the phase current ia(t) depends on the difference
</p>
<p>between the instantaneous value of the phase voltage and the electromotive force
</p>
<p>induced in the winding. Variation of the phase current during one commutation
</p>
<p>period T depends on the average phase voltage ua(av) during one commutation
</p>
<p>period. The change in the phase current is based on the voltage balance equation
</p>
<p>ua &frac14; RSia &thorn; dCa/dt, where RSia is the voltage drop across the stator resistance
while dCa/dt is the electromotive force induced in one phase.
</p>
<p>Distribution of magnetic field along the air gap depends on characteristics of
</p>
<p>permanent magnet and the way of their mounting. The air-gap field is also affected
</p>
<p>by the stator currents. The flux in the stator phase winding a isCa &frac14; LSia &thorn; CRm(a),
and it has two components. Component CRm(a) is produced by permanent magnets,
</p>
<p>while the flux LSia depends on the stator currents.
2 Component CRm(a) depends on
</p>
<p>the amplitude and spatial orientation of the flux CRm, which is generated by
</p>
<p>permanent magnets, which passes through the air gap, and which encircles the stator
</p>
<p>windings. AmplitudeCRm is determined by characteristics of permanent magnets, by
</p>
<p>the air gap d, and by properties of magnetic circuits. The spatial orientation of the
</p>
<p>permanent magnet flux is determined by the rotor position ym. Therefore, the flux
</p>
<p>CRm(a) depends on the amplitudeCRm and on the rotor position ym. With ym &frac14; 0, the
rotor is aligned with magnetic axis of the phase a, resulting in CRm(a)&frac14;CRm.
</p>
<p>The changes in the stator flux Ca produce electromotive force dCa/dt. The later
</p>
<p>has two components, LS dia/dt and dCRm(a)/dt. The second component ea &frac14; dCRm(a)/
dt is caused by the flux of permanent magnets, and it depends on the rotor speed
</p>
<p>Om &frac14; dym/dt.
With constant rotor speed, the orientation of the permanent magnet flux is
</p>
<p>determined by ym &frac14; y0 &thorn; pOmt. The part of this flux which encircles the phase
winding a is equal toCRmcos(ym). Besides, the phase winding has also the flux LSia;
</p>
<p>thus, the total flux of this phase is Ca &frac14; Cmcos(ym) &thorn; LSia. The voltage balance
equation becomes ua &frac14; RSia &thorn; LS dia/dt � omCmsin(ym). By neglecting the
</p>
<p>2Notice at this point that the flux Ca in phase a depends on the phase current ia but also on the
</p>
<p>phase currents ib and ic, due to a finite mutual inductance between the phase windings. Due to
</p>
<p>ia &frac14; �ib �ic and with reasonable assumption that Lab &frac14; Lac, the flux component Laia &thorn; Labib &thorn;
Lacic &frac14; Laia &thorn; Lab(ib &thorn; ic) can be rewritten as LS ia.

<p>voltage drop across the stator resistance and by adopting notation ea &frac14; dCRm(a)/
dt &frac14; �omCmsin(ym), the voltage balance equation becomes ua &frac14; LS dia/dt &thorn; еа.
With that in mind, the rate of change of the stator current ia can be expressed as
</p>
<p>dia
</p>
<p>dt
&frac14; 1
</p>
<p>LS
ua � ea&eth; &THORN; &frac14;
</p>
<p>1
</p>
<p>LS
�E� ea&eth; &THORN;: (22.2)
</p>
<p>In operating conditions where E � jeaj, the phase voltage ua prevails in the
above expression. For ua &frac14; +E/2, the rate of change of the stator current is positive,
notwithstanding the electromotive force ea. For ua &frac14; �E/2, the rate of change of
the stator current is negative. In other words, it is possible to obtain an increase of ia
by turning on the switch Q1 and a decrease of ia by turning on the switch Q2. These
</p>
<p>are the basic prerequisites for the current control. If the phase current ia does not
</p>
<p>correspond to the reference value, the current controller detects the error Dia &frac14; ia
*
</p>
<p>� ia. Then, it generates command signals for the inverter commutation so that the
error Dia is reduced and eventually removed. In cases where the error is positive
</p>
<p>(Dia &gt; 0), it is necessary to turn the upper switch Q1 on and to obtain dia/dt &gt; 0.
This would reduce the error Dia &frac14; ia
</p>
<p>* � ia. In cases where the error is negative
(Dia &lt; 0), it is necessary to turn on the lower switch Q2 and to obtain reduction in
the phase current (dia/dt &lt; 0). This would drive the error Dia &frac14; ia
</p>
<p>* � ia toward
zero. A simple control law that proves efficient in controlling the stator currents of
</p>
<p>three-phase AC motors is expressed by the following equation:
</p>
<p>ua &frac14;
E
</p>
<p>2
� sign i�a � ia
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>; ub &frac14;
E
</p>
<p>2
� sign i�b � ib
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>; uc &frac14;
E
</p>
<p>2
� sign i�c � ic
</p>
<p>� �
</p>
<p>:
</p>
<p>With the above control law, transistor power switches Q1&ndash;Q6 are commutated
</p>
<p>according to the sign of corresponding current error Di. Whenever the error
</p>
<p>becomes positive, the upper switch is turned on, which increases the phase current
</p>
<p>and reduces the error. As soon as the error becomes negative, the lower switch is
</p>
<p>turned on to reduce the phase current and drive the error in positive direction.
</p>
<p>Hence, the straight application of the above control law may result in elevated
</p>
<p>commutation frequencies of the power transistors and increased commutation
</p>
<p>losses. In order to contain the commutation frequency, it is possible to introduce
</p>
<p>some hysteresis3 into comparators which determine the sign of the current error. In
</p>
<p>this case, the commutation frequency is restrained by the hysteresis of comparators.
</p>
<p>Practical current controllers operate in d&ndash;q coordinate frame. This means that the
</p>
<p>errors Did &frac14; id
* � id &frac14; 0 � id and Diq &frac14; iq
</p>
<p>* � iq are calculated from references
and feedback signals in d&ndash;q coordinate frame. The current controller calculates
</p>
<p>the voltages ud and uq conceived to eliminate detected errors and drive the currents
</p>
<p>3Comparator with hysteresis H generates the output on the basis of the previous comparison and
</p>
<p>on the new input. With previous output equal to +1, the input signal has to fall below �H in order
to produce the new output of �1. With previous output equal to �1, the input signal has to climb
above +H in order to produce the new output of +1.

<p>id and iq to their references. The voltages ud and uq are transformed to the stationary
</p>
<p>a&ndash;b coordinate system by inverse Park transform, and the obtained voltages ua and
</p>
<p>ub are passed to the inverse Clarke transform to obtain the voltage references for the
</p>
<p>phase voltages. Pulse-width-modulation-controlled three-phase inverter is used to
</p>
<p>supply the desired voltages to the three-phase motor.
</p>
<p>The algorithm which calculates the control variable udq &frac14; ud &thorn; juq from the
current error Didq &frac14; Did &thorn; jDiq is called control algorithm, while the regulator or
controller is the device which implements the algorithm and provides the output.
</p>
<p>Control algorithms are usually applied in digital form, by means of a program
</p>
<p>which is executed by digital signal processor. Regulator can often be described by
</p>
<p>its transfer function. The speed and quality of dynamic response depend on the
</p>
<p>transfer function of the controller.
</p>
<p>The power converter with six switching power transistors supplies the three-phase
</p>
<p>stator winding by adjustable voltages. Therefore, it represents a controllable voltage
</p>
<p>supply. By closing the feedback loop which controls the stator phase currents, an
</p>
<p>appropriate current controller achieves that ia &frac14; ia*, ib &frac14; ib*, and ic &frac14; ic*. This
turns the current-controlled three-phase inverter into a current source. Hence, the
</p>
<p>three-phase machine behaves as if it were supplied from a current source. The
</p>
<p>operation of synchronous permanent magnet motor and controlled stator currents
</p>
<p>is similar to the operation of DC machine with constant excitation with controller
</p>
<p>armature current. The speed and accuracy in delivering the torque are fully
</p>
<p>dependent on characteristics of the current controller.
</p>
<p>22.4 Field Weakening
</p>
<p>Current control can be accomplished in conditions where the electromotive force
</p>
<p>e induced in the stator phase windings does not exceed the available phase voltage
</p>
<p>E/2, where E is the DC voltage across the intermediate circuit called DC link circuit
</p>
<p>of the three-phase inverter. Condition E/2 � jeaj &frac14; jomCmsin(ym)j must be ful-
filled at every instant. In operation with id &frac14; 0, the stator flux in d-axis of the
machine is equal to
</p>
<p>Cd &frac14; CRm &thorn; Ldid &frac14; CRm; (22.3)
</p>
<p>while the stator flux in q-axis isCq &frac14; Lqiq. In synchronous machines with surface-
mounted magnets, the stator inductances Ld and Lq are very low, and they range
</p>
<p>from 0.01 to 0.05 relative units. Therefore, the flux along q-axis is considerably
</p>
<p>lower than the flux CRm. For this reason, it is justifiable to assume that the air-gap
</p>
<p>flux amplitude equals Cm � CRm &thorn; Lmid &frac14; CRm &frac14; Cn, where Cn is the rated
flux. At the rated rotor speed On &frac14; on/p � E/CRm/p &frac14; E/Cn/p, induced
electromotive force is equal to the rated voltage, which is at the same time the
</p>
<p>maximum voltage available from the three-phase switching inverter. With id &frac14; 0,
permanent magnet synchronous motor cannot exceed the rated speed.
</p>
<p>22.4 Field Weakening 629</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When approaching the rated speed, the electromotive force approaches the maxi-
</p>
<p>mum available voltage. There is no more voltage margin and no possibility to
</p>
<p>control the stator current. In other words, there is no possibility to establish the
</p>
<p>stator currents required to obtaining the desired torque.
</p>
<p>Operation at speeds above the rated speed requires the electromotive force to
</p>
<p>remain below the rated voltage. For that to achieve, it is necessary to reduce the
</p>
<p>flux, namely, to achieve the flux weakening. In order to keep the electromotive
</p>
<p>force omCm within the boundaries of the available voltage, the air-gap flux Cm
has to be changed in terms of the rotor speed. With flux that changes as Cm(Om)
</p>
<p>&frac14; Cn ∙ On/Om &frac14; CRm ∙ on/om, induced electromotive force at speeds above the
rated speed retains its rated valueCRm ∙ on. It should be noted that the q-axis flux
</p>
<p>Lqiq is considerably smaller than the flux of permanent magnets. The later
</p>
<p>assumption holds due to very small inductances Lq and Ld in synchronous
</p>
<p>machines with surface-mounted magnets. With CRm � Cq and Cm � Cd,
desired change of the flux Cm determines desired change of the flux Cd, which
</p>
<p>changes according to

</p>
<p>With Cm � CRm &thorn; Ldid, it is concluded that the field weakening requires a
certain negative current in d-axis, id &lt; 0, which performs defluxing or demagneti-
zation. The change of this defluxing current with the rotor speed is given in (22.5)
</p>

</p>
<p>630 22 Variable Frequency Synchronous Machines</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Answer (22.1): In operation with high speeds that exceed the rated speed, it is
necessary to provide defluxing current in d-axis which has a negative value, id &lt; 0.
This current reduces d-axis flux and maintains the electromotive force within the
</p>
<p>limits of the available supply voltage. In the absence of the load torque, the electro-
</p>
<p>magnetic torque and q-axis current are equal to zero. With iq &frac14; 0, all of the available
stator current can be used for weakening the field in d-axis. At steady state, the current
</p>
<p>in the stator windings must not exceed the rated current. Therefore, relative value of
</p>
<p>the defluxing current that can be maintained permanently is id &frac14; �1. By using the
expression for the defluxing current id(om) in the region of field weakening, one
</p>
<p>obtains (1 � on/om) &frac14; LS/CRm &frac14; LS/Cn. Relative value of the rated flux is equal to
one, thus resulting in on/om &frac14; 1 � 0.05 &frac14; 0.95, which gives om &frac14; 1.0526 on.
</p>
<p>***
</p>
<p>Previous example shows that synchronous motors with surface-mounted magnets
</p>
<p>and with very low stator inductance cannot perform any significant increase of the
</p>
<p>rotor speed above the rated value. Therefore, they cannot be used in the field-
</p>
<p>weakening operation. On the other hand, induction servomotor can operate in field-
</p>
<p>weakening mode and achieve the rotor speeds that exceed the rated speed by several
</p>
<p>times. This is due to the fact that the flux in induction motors gets produced by the
</p>
<p>stator current and not by permanent magnets. This shortcoming of synchronous
</p>
<p>servomotors is the principal reason that induction servomotors are still in use. Namely,
</p>
<p>other characteristics of these two types of servomotors go in favor of synchronous
</p>
<p>motors. Induction machines have the power of losses significantly larger than syn-
</p>
<p>chronousmachines.While the rotor losses in synchronousmachines are virtually zero,
</p>
<p>there are considerable rotor losses PCu2 &frac14; sPn in induction machines, proportional to
the slip. The absence of the rotor losses facilitates cooling of synchronous motors and
</p>
<p>allows larger current and flux densities. Therefore, synchronous servomotors have
</p>
<p>superior specific power and torque, and they are smaller than the equivalent induction
</p>
<p>servomotors. Moreover, their rotors have much lower inertia J, which is beneficial in
</p>
<p>most motion control applications. There are, however, applications of electrical
</p>
<p>actuators where it is very important to provide the operation in the field-weakening
</p>
<p>region and to provide the rotor speed that goes well beyond the rated speed. In these
</p>
<p>applications, induction servomotors are advantageously used.
</p>
<p>Synchronous motors with surface-mounted permanent magnets have a very low
</p>
<p>stator inductance. This proves as an advantage in motion control applications such
</p>
<p>as industrial robots and manipulators. With a low inductance LS, the rate of change
</p>
<p>of the stator current dia/dt &frac14; (ua � ea)/LS is very large and it reaches dia/dt � 104
In/s, which allows the electromagnetic torque Tem &frac14; k jCRm 	 iSj to make the
change from zero to the rated value in some 100 ms. Fast torque response
</p>
<p>contributes to an increased bandwidth and improved closed loop performance in
</p>
<p>speed control and position control applications. For this reason, synchronous
</p>
<p>motors with surface-mounted magnets are applied in industry automation, robotics,
</p>
<p>and many other motion control applications that employ speed and position control
</p>
<p>loops. The absence of the field-weakening operations in these applications is not
</p>
<p>considered a significant shortcoming.

</p>
<p>rotor surface is limited to the range of Om &isin; [�On . . . &thorn; On]. The maximum no
load speed at steady state is Omax(ss) &frac14; On/(1 � LS) which exceeds the rated speed
by several percents. The crossing of the steady-state operating limits and the
</p>
<p>abscissa in Tem � Om diagram is at the speed On/(1 � LS), which is just slightly
above the rated speed. Regarding the torque steady-state operating limits, continu-
</p>
<p>ous torque is determined by the rated stator current. The steady-state torque has to
</p>
<p>remain within the limits of the rated torque, �Tn 
 Tem 
 +Tn. Steady-state
operating area and transient operating area are shown in Fig. 22.3.
</p>
<p>The transient operating limits depend on the maximum available instantaneous
</p>
<p>value of the stator current. The stator current may exceed the rated current for a
</p>
<p>brief interval of time. This does not have to result in excessive motor temperature,
</p>
<p>provided that in between the current pulses there is sufficient time with reduced
</p>
<p>current, so that the motor can release the heat and cool down. All the motion control
</p>
<p>tasks are usually performed in cycles. Within each cycle, the torque of relatively
</p>
<p>large value is delivered within relatively short interval of time, in order to perform
</p>
<p>desired acceleration or deceleration. These short intervals are mostly followed by
</p>
<p>prolonged intervals with reduced torque and reduced stator current. For this reason,
</p>
<p>the ratio between the peak torque and the rms value of the torque within one motion
</p>
<p>cycle is very large. The same conclusion holds for the peak and rms values of the
</p>
<p>stator current. Therefore, the transient operating area is limited by the peak
</p>
<p>torque which exceeds the rated torque by several times. Synchronous permanent
</p>
<p>magnet motors are designed and manufactured to sustain overloads of Imax/In in
</p>
<p>excess to five.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The peak current capability is limited by the motor construction but also by the
</p>
<p>characteristics of the three-phase inverter which supplies the stator windings.
</p>
<p>Semiconductor power switches within the inverter comprise tiny silicon crystals
</p>
<p>with very low thermal capacity and with limited density of electrical current. In
</p>
<p>cases where the current density within semiconductor exceeds certain limit, there is
</p>
<p>an abrupt increase in temperature which changes the structure of the crystal and
</p>
<p>causes permanent damage to the semiconductor power switch. Semiconductor
</p>
<p>power switches can withstand electrical currents that exceed declared limits but
</p>
<p>only for relatively short intervals of time, measured in milliseconds. Large peak
</p>
<p>currents can also damage the synchronous servomotor. Large stator current may
</p>
<p>damage the permanent magnets. The stator currents produce the stator
</p>
<p>magnetomotive force, which depends on the current amplitude and on the number
</p>
<p>of turns. With large currents, the stator magnetomotive force produces large
</p>
<p>demagnetization field within the magnets. In B-H characteristic of permanent
</p>
<p>magnets, the operating point (B,H) of the magnets is moved closer to coercive
</p>
<p>field HC &lt; 0, where the induction B of permanent magnets reduces to zero. For
most permanent magnet materials, reaching the coercive field HC damages the
</p>
<p>magnet. Having reached this operating point, their remanent induction cannot
</p>
<p>return to the initial value. Instead, the remanent induction is decreased by two or
</p>
<p>three times. Therefore, the maximum permissible stator current is set to the value
</p>
<p>that does not bring the risk of damaging the magnets. At the same time, it has to be
</p>
<p>compatible with peak current capability of semiconductor power switches that are
</p>
<p>used within the three-phase inverter attached to the stator windings.
</p>
<p>The maximum torque Tmax which defines the limits of the transient operating
</p>
<p>area is determined by the peak current Imax. The maximum no load speed Omax(tr)
that can be reached over short time intervals is determined by expression Omax(tr)
&frac14; On/(1 � ImaxLS), where the stator inductance and the peak current are both
expressed in relative units.
</p>
<p>Question (22.2): An isotropic machine with permanent magnets on the rotor has
stator self-inductance of LS &frac14; 0.05. Find the maximum rotor speed that can be
reached for a short interval of time. The peak current capability is Imax &frac14; 5, while
the mechanical load attached to the shaft is equal to zero.
</p>
<p>Answer (22.2): By using expression for demagnetizing current id(om) in the field-
weakening region, one obtains that (1 � on/om) &frac14; ImaxLS/CRm &frac14; ImaxLS/Cn. Rel-
ative value of the rated flux is equal to one; thus, the ratio of the rated speed and the
</p>
<p>maximum speed is determined by on/om &frac14; 1 � 5 ∙ 0.05 &frac14; 0.75, resulting in
Om &frac14; 1.33 ∙ On.
</p>
<p>***
</p>
<p>Synchronous permanent magnet machines are also used in applications that
</p>
<p>require high efficiency, low losses, and high specific power, but where it is not
</p>
<p>necessary to effectuate quick changes of the electromagnetic torque. These
</p>
<p>applications do not include motion control tasks, and they do not use synchronous
</p>
<p>machines in speed control and position control loops. Some of the examples are the
</p>
<p>22.5 Transient and Steady-State Operating Area 633</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>motors used in blowers, household appliances, and HVAC systems but also the
</p>
<p>generators in renewable sources of electrical energy, such as the wind turbines, the
</p>
<p>motors in electrical vehicle propulsion, auxiliary drives in automotive field, and
</p>
<p>similar. Superior efficiency, lower weight, and lower inertia of synchronous per-
</p>
<p>manent magnet motors are the reasons for their use instead of corresponding
</p>
<p>induction machines. In order to improve the field-weakening performance of
</p>
<p>synchronous permanent magnet machines, it is possible to remove the permanent
</p>
<p>magnets from the rotor surface and to burry them deep into the rotor magnetic
</p>
<p>circuit. This results in larger values of the stator self-inductance. According to
</p>
<p>(22.5), larger LS improves capability of synchronous machines to operate above
</p>
<p>the rated speed. Yet, the field-weakening performance of synchronous permanent
</p>
<p>magnet machine is inferior to that of induction machines. Synchronous
</p>
<p>permanent magnet machines that operate in the field-weakening range require
</p>
<p>considerable demagnetization current id &lt; 0 which does not contribute to the
torque, while increasing the amplitude of the stator current IS &frac14; sqrt(id2 &thorn; iq2)
and increasing the copper losses. For that reason, the applications requiring
</p>
<p>prolonged operation in field-weakening mode with considerable ratio Om/On call
</p>
<p>for an induction machine.
