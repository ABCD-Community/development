<p>Cat a loging
and Clas si fi ca tion
</p>
<p>for Li brary Tech ni cians
Sec ond Edi tion
</p>
<p>ast fall our LTA program used
the first edition of Cat a loging
</p>
<p>and Clas si fi ca tion for Li brary Tech ni cians
as one of the textbooks for our Intro-
duc tion to Tech ni cal Ser vices course.
We were so im pressed with this edi -
tion that we de cided to use it as
the only textbook for sub sequent
classes. The revised edi tion of the book
is very im pressive. An ad ditional chap -
ter, &lsquo;Cat aloging on Computers,&rsquo; has
been added and the ex planation on the
MARC format is quite good. Students
and practicing LTAs will un derstand
the var i ous tags and in di ca tors as so ci -
ated with a MARC record. The chap ter
contains good examples of books,
video record ings, se ri als, and com-
puter disks cat aloged in MARC for-
mat. Kao also gives the reader a guide
to the commonly used MARC tags,
</p>
<p>fields, and indicators. There is also in -
formation on how to search OCLC,
which was not included in the previous
edi tion.
</p>
<p>The chap ter con cern ing is sues and
trends has also been ex panded to in -
clude outsourcing, co op er a tion among
li brar ies, and the Dub lin Core, which
provides a core set of metadata el ements
that can be used to cat alog Internet re-
sources.
</p>
<p>Dr. Kao has ex panded the trends to
in clude the fol low ing: on line cat a log ing
will be per formed by the small est li brar-
ies, LTAs will be hired to replace li brari-
ans to do cat a log ing, and cat a log ing
departments will be merged into auto-
ma tion de part ments be cause of the
chang ing nature of the profession. This
may al low LTAs to be cross-trained to
perform other tasks in the tech nical ser -
vices area.&rdquo;

<p>aving taught with the pre vi-
ous 1995 edi tion of Dr. Kao&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>text, I was pleased to see the new edi -
tion come for ward. The ma terials are
presented in a clear and se quential
fashion that lays the groundwork and
pro vides con text for the cat a log ing pro-
cess within a li brary. Li brary ser vices
and the man agement of col lections
have changed dra matically with the
advent of the dig ital era, and many
libraries are in a pe riod of ex tended
tran si tion pro vid ing ac cess to both
phys i cal and vir tual re sources. The
new edi tion of this text addresses these
changes di rectly in a new chap ter de -
voted to computerized cataloging.
</p>
<p>The dual strength of this text book is
its at tention to the standards and orga-
ni za tional con cepts that tran scend the
technology of the day while bringing
for ward rel e vant ex am ples and ex er-
cises that dem on strate prac ti cal ap pli -
cations for li brary tech nicians. The new 
chap ter de voted to cat a log ing on com-
puters is in troduced only af ter sec tions
out lin ing de scrip tive cat a log ing, sub-
ject anal y sis, and clas si fi ca tion have
been pre sented. Ex am ple re cords are
well cho sen to dem onstrate the breadth
of phys i cal ma te ri als that li brary tech-
nicians will be called on to cat alog as
well as Internet resources.
</p>
<p>The fi nal chap ter on is sues and
trends un derscores the dy namic na -
ture of li braries in gen eral, and cat a-
loging in par ticular, and should lead
to lively discussion among students
as to the pros and cons of is sues such
as outsourcing.
</p>
<p>I recommend Dr. Kao&rsquo;s new edi -
tion as the principal text in a Library
Tech ni cal As so ci ate pro gram and as a
ref er ence tool for li brary tech ni cians
in a work ing cat a log de part ment.&rdquo;

</p>
<p>eachers of cat aloging are re-
nowned for the demands they
</p>
<p>make upon their stu dents. Dr. Mary
Kao&rsquo;s book dem onstrates that she, a
long-time pro fes sor of cat a log ing, is
even more de manding of her self. Her
book in cludes ev erything a stu dent
could want. Kao introduces her topic in 
the con text of li brary or ga ni za tion, the
role of tech nical as sistants, and the
func tions of cat a log ing and clas si fi ca -
tion. She defines relevant terms near
the be ginning of ev ery chap ter and
gives de tailed ci tations to the resources
upon which catalogers rely. In ad dition
to the latest edi tions of old standards
like AACR2R, LC, DDC, Sears, and
Cutter, she furnishes the URLs of Web
sites that complement and up date the
print clas sics. Her review questions test
whether or not the student has grasped
both concept and prac tice.

<p>Preface
</p>
<p>With more and more li braries be ing au tomated, the na ture of the
work in the cat aloging de partment has changed tre mendously. Cat a-
loging has be come more technical and less in terpretive, with empha-
sis on uni formity rather than lo cal vari ations. Cat aloging done on the
computer has to be pre cise, and ad herence to all the uni versally
adopted rules needs to oc cur. In most li braries, the bur den of per -
forming this task has been shifted from li brarians to li brary tech ni-
cians, and it is more im portant than ever that the li brary tech nicians
re ceive good ed u ca tion and train ing.
</p>
<p>For the past twenty years, when ever I taught the course Cat aloging
and Clas sification in our Library Tech nology pro gram, I was con -
fronted with the difficult job of find ing a suit able textbook for the
course. After search ing year af ter year in vain, I had to face the fact
that it just had not been written, at least not that I knew of. A text book
in the field of cat a log ing and clas si fi ca tion for li brary tech ni cians
needed to be written.
</p>
<p>Every year, I had to re sort to de signing the con tent of the course,
planning the or der of pre sentation, and us ing my own notes to teach
the course. This was in convenient for the stu dents. Many pre fer to
own a text book that not only facilitates note taking, but also serves as
a base of reference and a per manent re source on the sub ject. Finally, I 
decided that a book to serve this pur pose was nec essary, and with the
encouragement of ed itor Ruth Carter of The Haworth Press, this en -
deavor came into be ing.
</p>
<p>The book is de signed as a text book for a Cat aloging and Classifi-
cation course for the two-year Li brary Tech nology As sociate De gree
or Cer tificate Pro gram. To pro vide stu dents with gen eral back ground
in for ma tion, the course In tro duc tion to Tech ni cal Ser vices is rec om -
mended as a pre req ui site for the Cat a loging and Clas si fi ca tion course,
which is a three-credit, one-semester course.

<p>This text also will serve as a general ref erence book for li brary
tech ni cians work ing in the cat a log ing de part ment. Stu dents are re-
minded that this text is not a substitute for all the ref erence tools
needed to per form the job of cataloging. This is an in terpre ta tion and
explanation of the rules and how they should be ap plied.
</p>
<p>I would like to acknowledge the as sistance of my friend Jo anne
Fontanella. Her sug gestions have been most use ful. With out her ed it-
ing skills and en couragement, the task could not have been done so
smoothly. I am very grateful to her and thank her for her pa tience.

<p>Preface to the Second Edition
</p>
<p>Much has changed in the field of cataloging and clas sification since
the first edi tion of this book was pub lished in 1995. New edi tions of the 
ref er ence tools have been pub lished with mod i fi ca tions and ad di tions.
The li brary en vironment has changed as well. Au tomation has taken
over, and even the smallest li brary is now somewhat com puterized.
Even if a library is not a member of a con sortium, chances are that
some kind of stand-alone au tomation sys tem is in place. Cat aloging on
the com puter in MARC for mat has be come much more com mon, and,
therefore, it is important and necessary for li brary tech nicians to learn
the ins and outs of cataloging in MARC for mat, as well as the ba sic
skills of de scrip tive and sub ject cat a log ing.
</p>
<p>The sec ond edi tion fol lows the for mat and style of the pre vious
edition. It starts with a gen eral in troduction on the topics and con tin-
ues with an in-depth discussion and ex planation of all the ref erence
tools that are needed to per form the task of cataloging. Step-by-step
instruction is pro vided so that the tar get us ers of this book, stu dents
with no li brary ex perience, will gradually learn and un derstand the
essence of each task and will feel con fident with it.
</p>
<p>Every chap ter has been re vised and up dated with new materials
presented to re flect the changes and de velopment of the rules and the
new edi tions of other ref erence tools. A new chap ter on cat aloging on 
computers in MARC for mat (Chap ter 8) has been added. Cataloging
Internet materials has been in cluded in this chap ter. All ex amples
have been up dated or ver ified in the latest edi tions of the ref erence
tools dis cussed. In some places, more examples are in serted to il lus-
trate how the theory is put into prac tice.
</p>
<p>Users of this text must have the orig inal ref erence tools cited here
readily available. For ex ample, al though An glo-Amer i can Cat a loguing
Rules, Second Edi tion, 1998, is dis cussed in de tail in Chap ter 4, that
publication is re quired to prop erly and ex actly ap ply rules of per -
form ing de scrip tive cat a log ing. The book is in tended for be gin ning

<p>Chapter 1
</p>
<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>So, you want to be a library tech nician? Or, more pre cisely, you
want to be a cataloging as sistant, or, per haps, you want to learn more
about cat a log ing? Be fore study ing the es sen tial de tails of cat a log ing
and clas sification, a gen eral back ground is nec essary. To have an
over all un der stand ing of the op er a tion of a li brary, in for ma tion must
be ac quired re gard ing the whole li brary or ga ni za tion and its sep a rate
library func tions. It is im portant to know how cat aloging and clas sifi-
cation fit into the in frastructure. Before we get to the main top ics of
cat a log ing and clas si fi ca tion, we need to un der stand the hi er ar chy of
library per sonnel. We need to ex plore ques tions such as, What is a li-
brary tech nician, or a library tech nical assistant? What kinds of jobs
does a li brary tech nician per form? What is the re lationship be tween
the li brary tech nician and other li brary staff?
</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>acqui si tions: The pro cess of plan ning, select ing, order ing, and receiv-
ing mate rials in a library.
</p>
<p>auto ma tion: Com puterization of library functions, such as check ing
books out by com puter, order ing mate rials from ven dors or pub lishers
through con nected databases, using the online public access cat alog,
and using online or CD-ROM data bases to retrieve infor mation.
</p>
<p>cat a log ing: The pro cess of orga nizing library materials and mak ing
them accessible to library users. Cat aloging work is divided into three
parts: descrip tive cat a log ing, sub ject head ing, and clas si fi ca tion.
</p>
<p>1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>cir cu la tion: Also called access ser vice, this library func tion mainly
consists of check ing in and checking out materials, shelv ing, shelf
reading, and main tenance of shelves. Cir culation duties also include
the main tenance of data bases, such as build ing a users&rsquo; data base on
the com puter.
</p>
<p>clas si fi ca tion: The num ber or a com bination of letters and num bers
assigned to a work indi cating its sub ject. The pur pose is to have materi-
als of the same sub ject stand side by side on the shelves for easy
brows ing.
</p>
<p>inter li brary loan: When users request materials not owned by one
library, the library bor rows them from another library on behalf of the
users. The requested mate rials may be mailed, deliv ered, faxed, or
elec tron i cally trans mit ted to the bor row ing library. Many librar ies
offer free inter library loan service; oth ers charge a fee.
</p>
<p>library tech ni cian: A mem ber of the library staff who is in the mid dle
level of the per sonnel hier archy, who super vises cler ical and stu dent
workers, and who is super vised by librar ians.The library technician is
also called the library tech nical assis tant, abbre viated as LTA, or
para-professional, or library sup port staff. Though there is no
national requirement for this classification, the library technician
customarily has an associate degree or cer tificate in the field of
Library Tech nol ogy.
</p>
<p>pub lic ser vices: Some times called reader&rsquo;s ser vices, these are duties
performed in the library&rsquo;s pub lic area that require some con tact
between library staff and users. Reference ser vices and programming
for chil dren are pub lic ser vices. Cir culation used to be con sidered
public ser vice, but because it now involves the main tenance of data -
bases, it may be grouped with Tech nical Ser vices.
</p>
<p>ref er ence: A func tion in which library staff answer inqui ries of the
users. Ref erence per sonnel instruct users on the use of library materi-
als and facilities and assist them in finding needed mate rials or
infor ma tion.
</p>
<p>reserve: Reserve has two mean ings. (1) It refers to mate rials kept in
closed stacks, allow ing more users to access such mate rials for a
</p>
<p>2 Cataloging and Classification for Library Technicians</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>shorter period of time. (2) It refers to materials kept behind the cir cu-
lation desk that may be checked out only by the requester.
</p>
<p>tech ni cal ser vices: Services per formed behind the scenes in the library
for the con venience of the library users. These activities include, but are
not lim ited to, selecting and order ing mate rials, cat aloging and pro cess-
ing mate rials, and main taining the databases.
</p>
<p>THE ORGANIZATION OF THE LIBRARY
</p>
<p>First, let us ex plore how li braries are or ganized. Just as ev ery per -
son is an in di vid ual, so ev ery li brary is or ga nized in di vid u ally. How-
ever, one gen eral pat tern emerges as a model. Tra ditionally, all
library func tions are placed un der two sec tions: tech ni cal ser vices
and pub lic ser vices. Tech nical ser vices usually in clude all the be -
hind-the-scenes work, such as ac qui si tions, cat a log ing, pro cess ing,
binding, and book re pair. Pub lic ser vices, also called reader&rsquo;s ser -
vices, usu ally em brace ref er ence, cir cu la tion, re serve, and inter-
library loan. As men tioned ear lier, each li brary is or ganized a little
differently, so  in terlibrary loan might be cat egorized by some libraries
under tech nical ser vices. Also, with the increasing use of on line cata-
logs, more li brar ies are clas si fy ing cir cu la tion un der tech ni cal ser vices

<p>Cat a loging is the pro cess of or ga niz ing li brary ma te ri als and mak ing
them ac cessible to li brary users. The chal lenge the cat aloger faces is ac -
commodating the many diverse ap proaches peo ple use in re trieving li-
brary ma terials. A good cat aloger makes it pos sible for us ers to find
ma te ri als eas ily, what ever ap proach is ap plied. Good cat a log ing
prac tices make li brary op er a tion more ef fi cient. The most won der ful
collection is useless if the ma terials are not eas ily ac cessible to li brary
users. Cat aloging is also called bib liographic con trol, and un der-
standing the why and how of bib liographic con trol is not only vital to
staff working in the cataloging de partment, it is im portant to all li -
brary per sonnel. Ref erence and pub lic ser vice staff are more likely to
perform their du ties ef fectively if they have some background knowl -
edge in cat a log ing and clas si fi ca tion. This in cludes un der stand ing
how the col lections are ar ranged for use and how to as sist us ers in
finding needed in formation in an accurate and timely fash ion. Spe cial
training is nec essary to en sure that li brary staff ac quire knowl edge
and skills on the theories and pro cedures of the cat aloging and clas si-
fi ca tion pro cess. Con tinuing ed u ca tion in volv ing new de vel op ments
and trends in the field, in cluding rule changes and re visions, must be
avail able.
</p>
<p>To fa cilitate the cat aloging pro cess, guides and codes are de -
signed, re viewed, and re de signed by li brary or ga ni za tions. The of fi -
cial guides and codes, in turn, are adopted by li braries to en sure
uniformity from library to li brary. In a time when peo ple move from
place to place and use different li braries at dif ferent times, con sis-
tency is es sential. Even for the us ers of small li braries, con fusion is
minimized when of ficially adopted stan dards are prac ticed. In the
sense of shared cat alogs and per sonal com puter con nections, au toma-
tion al lows ac cess to many dif fer ent li brar ies si mul ta neously; more
rea son for uni for mity in cat a log ing and clas si fi ca tion rules. Knowl-
edge of cat aloging rules and codes, along with a gen eral back ground
in cat aloging, en courages all library staff to un derstand how the col -
lection is or ganized and to identify quickly and eas ily the materials
contained within the lo cal col lection or from other remote-
ac cess li brar ies.
</p>
<p>In the area of cataloging, the library tech nician&rsquo;s job has changed in
the past de cade chiefly be cause of au tomation and bud get re straints.

brary tech nicians need to pos sess more so phisticated skills. The li -

<p>It can not be over em pha sized that proper cat a log ing is es sen tial for
li brary op er a tion. The Internet, how ever, pro vides no le git i mate cat a -

<p>Chapter 2
</p>
<p>Library Catalogs
</p>
<p>What is a li brary cat alog? A li brary cat alog is a re cord or a list of
the col lection of a par ticular li brary, or of the col lection of many li-
braries that are con nected elec tronically. When it is a com bined list of 
the hold ings of many li braries, it is called a un ion cat alog or a shared
catalog. We can also say that a li brary cat alog is an or ganized list of
information resources ar ranged in log ical, pre scribed or der. Why is it
necessary for ev ery li brary to have a cat alog? Cat alogs serve many
different functions that will be explained in this chapter. Ba sically,
catalogs are established so that li brary users are able to re trieve the
needed in for ma tion. A good cat a log is a good in for ma tion de liv ery
tool. To pro duce a good cat alog, all materials must be cataloged so
that they can be found. Cat alogs come in a variety of sizes and for -
mats. When study ing about library cat alogs, it is nec essary to un der-
stand what are known as in dividual en tries that identify each item in
the col lection. As a li brary tech nician, you will be re quired to in ter-
pret the en tries to the us ers, if you work in the pub lic ser vices area, or, 
if you are a cataloger, to ac tually work on de termining how to prop -
erly en ter in for ma tion.
</p>
<p>A li brary cat alog is never complete be cause the li brary col lection
is a liv ing in stitution. Materials are added on a daily basis as well as
re moved at reg u lar in ter vals. To ac cu rately re flect the col lec tion of
the li brary, it is nec essary to up date the catalog con stantly.

graphs), pe riodicals (also re ferred to as se rials, which in clude both

<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>bib lio graphic record: A term used to describe the cat aloging infor -
mation for an item. Included are author, title, pub lisher, date, phys ical
description of the item, and any other per tinent infor mation needed to
identify the mate rial as a unique item.
</p>
<p>book cat a log: A list ing of the library&rsquo;s hold ings in book form. A
computer print out is the latest form of a book cat alog.
</p>
<p>card cat a log: A form of cat alog that is made up of 3 &times; 5-inch cards.
On each card, infor mation about an item is writ ten, typed, or printed.
Cards are arranged in alpha betical order and filed in draw ers espe -
cially designed for this pur pose. The interfiling by author, title, and
subject cards is called a dic tionary cat alog. When cards are filed sep a-
rately so that all sub ject cards are filed in one section, and all author
and title cards are filed in another, this is called a divided cat alog.
</p>
<p>CD-ROM cat a log: The com pact disc read-only mem ory is an opti -
cal disk played on a spe cial disk player linked to a com puter ter minal.
The library&rsquo;s collection is engraved on the disk, and when the disk is
played on a CD-ROM drive con nected to a com puter, infor mation
can be retrieved.
</p>
<p>COM cat a log: Com puter Output Microform cat alog is a listing of the
library&rsquo;s col lection that is either on micro film or in a micro fiche for-
mat. A microfilm/fiche reader machine is used to read the information.
</p>
<p>library cat a log: A list or a record of all the mate rials in a library.
May also include mate rials from other cooperating libraries that
belong to the same net work or con sortium.
</p>
<p>OPAC: The Online Pub lic Access Catalog is a list ing of the library

<p>union cat a log: A com bined cat alog that includes the collection of
groups of librar ies. There are local union catalogs, nation wide union cat -
alogs, and inter national union cat alogs. A union cat alog is also called a
shared cat a log.
</p>
<p>FUNCTIONS OF THE CATALOGS
</p>
<p>Why is it so im portant to have an ac curate and up-to-date cat alog?
Here are the functions of a cat alog:
</p>
<p>1. To indicate to the users what is housed in the library. Catalogs list
every single item acquired by the library. In the case of a union, or
shared catalog, besides displaying what the library has, the catalog
also shows what the library can obtain for the users.
</p>
<p>2. To help users make the proper selection. With all the information
in the catalog, users are able to get pertinent facts such as author,
title, publisher, publication date, relevant subject, and the format of 
the material, such as book, videorecording, or computer file.
</p>
<p>3. To provide access to the materials, whether through the author,
title, or subject. Location is indicated by a letter and number
symbol referred to as a call number. This letter and number
combination indicates exactly where the wanted materials are
shelved or stored. In a union or shared catalog, the location column
also identifies the name of the library that owns the materials.
</p>
<p>4. To function as an indispensable tool for library staff in the areas of
acquisition, cataloging, inventory control, and reference works.
</p>
<p>TYPES OF CATALOGS
</p>
<p>The Book Catalog
</p>
<p>The book cat alog is the ear liest form of cat alog. An cient libraries
listed the ti tles in the col lection on pa pers that were bound in book
form. In the nine teenth and twentieth cen turies, the card catalog be -
came widely ac cepted and al most com pletely re placed the book cat a-
log. In the 1960s and early 1970s, com puterized li braries started to
print book cat alogs again.
</p>
<p>Library Catalogs 11</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Because sup plements have to be pro duced fre quently and attached
to the ex ist ing cat a log, the book cat a log is in flex i ble and cum ber some 
for the us ers. The ad vantage of us ing a book cat alog in the form of a
computer printout is that new entries are au tomatically filed, re duc-
ing the la bor cost for li brary per sonnel. Also, many cop ies can be
made available for dif ferent lo cations, such as for branch li braries,
for stu dents&rsquo; dor mi to ries, fac ulty of fices, etc.
</p>
<p>The Card Catalog
</p>
<p>Since the Library of Con gress launched the printing and sell ing of
catalog cards in 1901, the card cat alog, up to the late 1980s, has been
the most widely used type of cat alog. The card catalog uses 3 &times; 5-inch
cards filed in al phabetical or der in drawers that fit in a specially de -
signed cab inet. Li braries ei ther type or print their own cards, have an
outside printer print the cards, or, more of ten, buy the already printed
cards from the Library of Con gress, a com mercial book dealer, or one 
of the many library sup ply com panies.
</p>
<p>The card cat alog system of fers flex ibility. New cards are interfiled
in their cor rect or der con stantly. Cards may be re moved eas ily from
the cat alog to re flect changing sta tus, such as with drawal or loss of
the item. Cards are rel a tively in ex pen sive and eas ily ac ces si ble.
</p>
<p>The main disadvantage is fil ing. It is la bor in tensive. The li brary
filer has to be very fa miliar with all the fil ing rules and work very
carefully and com petently. A misfiled card rep resents an item with no 
reference in the cat alog and may be permanently lost. As men tioned
earlier, cards need to be filed and re moved con stantly, and, therefore,
maintenance of the card cat alog is a bur densome and time-consum-
ing task. With au tomation, fil ing is done by the computer, and the
me chan i cal prob lems of main tain ing the card cat a log have been
solved, ren dering the card catalog sys tem ob solete. In the 1980s,
many li brar ies in stalled com put er ized cat a logs, ceased to file new
cards in the card catalog, and of ten stopped maintaining the card cata-
log. These frozen cat alogs re mained tem porarily for reference pur -
poses and to hold in formation on older materials not en tered into the
database. Finally, when the to tal col lection had been entered into the
computer da tabase, the card cat alog was given a death sen tence and
taken away to make room for com puter ter minals.

<p>COM (Computer Output Microform) Catalog
</p>
<p>In this for mat, bib liographic re cords are pho tographed and pro duced
on mi crofilm or microfiche, which is relatively inexpensive.  Space is
saved com pared to the card cat alog and the book catalog for mats.
</p>
<p>The dis advantages are some what sim ilar to those of the book cat alog,
in the sense that it is dif ficult and ex pensive to up date. It is in convenient
for us ers to em ploy the many sup plements and trou blesome, ini tially, to
learn to use the nec essary equipment, the mi crofilm/fiche reader/printer.
It also means extra ex penses because the li brary has to ac quire sev eral of
these ma chines. This form of catalog was adopted by some libraries for a 
short while in the 1970s but never be came very pop ular.
</p>
<p>OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog)
</p>
<p>OPACs be gan to ap pear in li braries in the late 1970s and the early
1980s. They quickly gained wide ac ceptance and be came the most
popular cat alog form. With ei ther the touch screen or the key board, us -
ers can ac cess the most up-to-date in formation on the library&rsquo;s col lec-
tion and can get a print out of that information. OPAC of fers fast
retrieval and an im mediate dis play. In a shared on line catalog, us ers
can re trieve in for ma tion from other par tic i pat ing li brar ies. These sys-
tems not only in dicate the holdings of dif ferent li braries but also tell the 
circulation sta tus of an item, whether it is on the shelf and, if not, when
the item is due back. Some sys tems al low us ers to place a hold on the
desired item or to di rectly re quest an item from other li braries through
interlibrary loan agreements among the li braries in the system.
</p>
<p>Due to ad vances in com puter tech nology and the im plementation
of stan dards in the technology world, li brary us ers now can search
hundreds of on line catalogs through re mote log-in fa cilities on the
Internet. The new gen eration of OPACs is eas ier to use and offers
more op tions.
</p>
<p>The on line cat a log has changed tra di tional cat a log ing in sev eral
ways:
</p>
<p>1. The dependence on shared bibliographic databases for cataloging
has increased copy cataloging and decreased original cataloging
activities.
</p>
<p>Library Catalogs 13</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2. The trend is toward linking the holdings of one library to other
local libraries, to other libraries in the country, or to the inter-
national database.
</p>
<p>3. The original catalog search methods based on the simple author,
title, subject arrangement have become a multitude of approaches,
such as subject key word search, title key word search, Boolean
search, and search by call number.
</p>
<p>4. The library catalog has expanded to include commercially
produced reference data, such as index and abstract services,
and full-text articles.
</p>
<p>5. Electronic, or digital data, including Internet resources, are
included in the catalog.
</p>
<p>6. The online catalog does not stand alone, and in most libraries, it
is an integrated system used for acquisition, circulation, reserve, 
and record-keeping functions.
</p>
<p>7. Users can have remote access to the database through their own
personal computers, from homes, offices, dormitories, schools&mdash;
from anywhere in the world where portable computers have
remote access capability.
</p>
<p>CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) Catalog
</p>
<p>CD-ROM tech nology makes it pos sible to have a li brary&rsquo;s hold -
ings en graved on com puter disks. The cost for an individual li brary to 
have its col lection put on compact disk used to be restrictive, and as a
result, li braries did it collectively with other li braries in the same net -
working en vironment. It has be come a pop ular for mat for li brary
consortia. One CD-ROM disk has a stor age ca pacity that is equiv a-
lent to 300,000 printed pages.
</p>
<p>The CD-ROM player is now an in tegral part of computer equip -
ment. Information can be shown on the computer ter minal, and for
most users, it is in distinguishable from the on line cat alog.
</p>
<p>New disks can be pro duced eas ily and quickly to up date listings.
Because it does not need to con nect to ex ternal da tabases, there is no
computer down time prob lem. Thus, this has be come the most pop u-
lar backup sys tem for the on line catalogs. The CD-ROM mar ket has
grown rap idly in the 1990s as an in expensive sub stitute for the on line
li brary sys tem. 
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The dis advantage of the CD-ROM cat alog is that it is not as up-to-
date as the on line cat alog. Be cause it is not in teractive in na ture, it
does not offer such con venient fea tures as item status, re serve, and in -
terlibrary re quest, which the on line catalog can of fer.
</p>
<p>ELEMENTS OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORD
</p>
<p>No mat ter what for mat the cat alog takes, the in formation displayed
is the same. Figures 2.1 and 2.2 show how the same in formation is
displayed both on a catalog card and on the com puter screen. In for-

<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>call num ber: This is a com bination of a classification num ber and a
letter and num ber code rep resenting the author. Each call num ber is 
unique and enables users to locate the needed material on the shelf&mdash;
the address of the mate rial.
</p>
<p>copy cat a log ing: The library staff cop ies or matches the cat aloging
information that is already completed by another cat aloger from
another library. The com pleted infor mation can be found in some
print sources, but, most likely, the library tech nician will get such
information from a computer data base.
</p>
<p>descrip tive cat a log ing: This is the first step of the cat aloging pro -
cess. This means describ ing the material phys ically and determining
the choice of access points (head ings). This is done by fol lowing the
rules listed in the reference tool Anglo-Amer i can Cat a loguing Rules,
Second Edi tion, 1998 Revi sion.
</p>
<p>orig i nal cat a log: The library cataloging staff per forms all the pro ce-
dures to com pletely cat alog mate rials. The tasks include descriptive
cat a log ing and assign ing sub ject head ings, clas si fi ca tion num bers,
and book num bers.
</p>
<p>sub ject cat a log ing: This sec ond step of the cataloging pro cess is
divided into two parts. First is to assign sub ject headings to the mate-
rials by using either Sears List of Sub ject Head ings or Library of Con -
gress Sub ject Head ings, whichever the par ticular library chooses. The
second part is to assign a clas sification num ber to the material by using
either Dewey Dec i mal Clas si fi ca tion Sched ules or Library of Con gress
</p>
<p>19</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Clas si fi ca tion Schedules, again depend ing on the choice of the par ticu-
lar library. A book num ber is added to the clas sification num ber to
complete the pro cess. The book num ber is assigned accord ing to C. A.
Cutter&rsquo;s Three-Fig ure Author Table.
</p>
<p>sub ject head ing: This term is used in library cat alogs to describe the
subject mat ter of the mate rials and as an added access point for
retrieving the materials using the sub ject approach.
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>To prop erly cat a log li brary ma te ri als and to main tain con sis tency,
rules need to be followed. It is even more im portant to follow the
rules rig idly when the library joins a net work and the cat alog be -
comes part of the shared da tabase. Ref erence books or the elec tronic
versions of ref erence books must be ac quired and the rules prac ticed.
These ref erences are called cat aloging tools or tools for cat aloging.
</p>
<p>Cataloging is done in two ways: orig inal cat aloging and copy cata-
log ing. Orig i nal cat a log ing means that the en tire pro cess of cat a log -
ing is com pleted lo cally by the li brary staff. In copy cat aloging, a
shortcut is taken that en tails copy ing the nec essary in formation from
a source that con tains works al ready cat aloged. Most cat aloging can
be done by way of copy cat aloging, thus avoid ing the un necessary
time and effort spent in du plicating the cataloging pro cesses. This is
es pe cially true in au to mated li brar ies, where the needed cat a log ing
information can be found in the da tabase to which the library has ac -
cess. On oc casion, how ever, for some very spe cial or unique ma terials,
nec es sary in for ma tion for copy cat a log ing can not be found. In such
cases, orig inal cat aloging must be per formed. Many odd doc uments
and pub lications of lo cal in terest be long in this category. While copy
cataloging is done for the majority of li brary ac quisitions, some ma te-
rials are al ways wait ing to be cataloged lo cally. In the past, li braries
used the cat a log li brar ian to per form orig i nal cat a log ing, while as-
signing to the library tech nician the job of copy cat aloging. With the
con tin u ous em pha sis on better train ing and more ed u ca tion, many li-
brary tech nicians now per form both jobs.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Steps or stages for per forming orig inal cat aloging are di vided into
two parts: de scrip tive cat a log ing and sub ject cat a log ing. Sub ject cat-
a log ing has two ad di tional stages: sub ject head ing and clas si fi ca tion.
The chart shown in Fig ure 3.1 il lustrates the steps for cat aloging.
</p>
<p>Rules and reg ulations are for mulated and pub lished for each step.
These rules have been adopted uni versally by the library world to
pro vide con sis tency and uni for mity for us ers. The li brary tech ni cian
needs to be fa miliar with ap propriate cataloging tools that con tain the
rules, so that rules for spe cific ma terial can be fol lowed ac curately.
Memorizing all the rules is nei ther pos sible nor prac tical, al though
the li brary tech nician needs to un derstand the rules and how to con-
sult the ref erence tools ef ficiently. The fol lowing ref erences are used
as cat a log ing tools.

printed sheets, car to graphic ma te ri als, manu scripts, mu sic and sound
re cord ings, mo tion pic tures and videorecordings, graphic ma te ri als,

(also re ferred to as head ings or entries) for us ers to re trieve ma terials,

</p>
<p>An elec tronic CD-ROM format of AACR2R, called AACR2R-e is
available for use. AACR2R can also be found on a CD-ROM disk
produced by the Library of Con gress ti tled Cat a loger&rsquo;s Desk top.
From this disk, the cataloger can look up rules while cat aloging on
the same screen. In addition to the con tents of AACR2R, Cat a loger&rsquo;s

<p>LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBJECT HEADINGS
</p>
<p>The se lec tion and as sign ment of sub ject head ings to ma te ri als is
the sec ond step in com pleting the cataloging pro cess. Library of Con -
gress Sub ject Head ings, usu ally called LCSH for short, is one of the
two tools used to per form this task. Up dated con stantly, LCSH es tab-
lishes sub ject terms to be used by cat alogers when as signing sub ject
headings for a particular item. Furthermore, it establishes terms re-
lated to the sub ject at hand, plus broader and nar rower re lated terms.
Finally, it lists terms that the cataloging staff should not use. Now in
its twenty-second edi tion (1999), LCSH has been adopted and is used 
by thou sands of li braries and a mul titude of print in dexes.
</p>
<p>The print edition of LCSH is up dated an nually and is available in
microfiche for mat, which is up dated quar terly. The electronic ver -

<p>Details of the LCSH and its use are dis cussed in Chap ter 5 of this
text.
</p>
<p>SEARS LIST OF SUBJECT HEADINGS
</p>
<p>Small pub lic libraries and school me dia cen ters usu ally choose to
use the Sears List of Sub ject Head ings as a hand book to com plete the
func tion of as sign ing sub ject head ings to ma te ri als. Sears is adopted
in most cases to avoid the com plexity of the Library of Con gress Sub -
ject Head ings. Sears lists fewer terms than the LCSH, but those listed
are ba si cally the same, with sim pli fi ca tion and mod i fi ca tion more ap-
propriate to the needs of smaller libraries. As the col lection be comes
larger and Sears proves to be in adequate, li braries may de cide to
switch to the LCSH. Be cause of au to ma tion and shared cat a log ing,
most net works re quire their members to use LCSH, and as a re sult, the
use of Sears has de creased.
</p>
<p>A new edi tion of Sears is pub lished as deemed nec essary by the
publisher. The latest one, the sixteenth edi tion, was pub lished in
1997. More on Sears and its us age appears in Chap ter 5 of this text.
</p>
<p>DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION
AND RELATIVE INDEX
</p>
<p>After as signing sub ject headings, the next step in cat aloging is to
as sign clas si fi ca tion num bers so that ma te ri als per tain ing to the same
subject are put side by side on the shelves, mak ing it more con venient
for li brary us ers to find related ma terials when brows ing the stacks.
Though some lo cal clas sification systems are in use, the two most im -
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>portant clas sification systems employed in the United States are the
Dewey Dec i mal Clas si fi ca tion and the Li brary of Con gress Clas si fi -
cation systems. Most small and me dium-sized public li braries and
virtually all school me dia cen ters choose to use the Dewey Dec imal
Clas si fi ca tion sys tem.
</p>
<p>The Dewey Dec i mal Clas si fi ca tion and Rel a tive In dex is pub lished in
two edi tions, full and abridged. The latest full edi tion is DDC 21, pub -
lished in 1996 by OCLC/Forest Press. In the pub lisher&rsquo;s fore word, it is
stated that li braries with a small col lection of up to 20,000 vol umes that
do not an ticipate sig nificant col lection growth may choose the Abridged
Edi tion 13. The DDC is kept up to date be tween edi tions through the
monthly post ing of new and changed en tries on the Dewey home page
&lt;www.oclc.org&gt;, and through the annual pub lication of Dewey Dec i mal 
Clas si fi ca tion Ad di tions, Notes and De ci sions (DCand).

<p>For li brar ies not us ing the Dewey Dec i mal Clas si fi ca tion sys-
tem&mdash;mainly the larger public li braries, special li braries, and ac a-
demic libraries&mdash;the Library of Congress Clas sification system is the 
choice. The con tents of this sys tem are pub lished as a set of alphabet-
ized, coded pa perbacks called class sched ules. Cur rently, the sys tem
includes forty-six vol umes al together. Each class sched ule is pub -
lished and re vised in dependently at different times. For ex ample, the
latest re vision for Sched ule A was pub lished in 1998, whereas Sched -

</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>access point: A name or a term that can be used to retrieve the bib lio-
graphic infor mation from a card cat alog or an online catalog. Exam -
ples are: author&rsquo;s name, title of the book, and sub ject heading. All
entries, or head ings, are access points.
</p>
<p>added entry: Other access point(s) besides the main entry used to
identify a work. For a book, added entries may include joint author,
translator, title, series title, etc.
</p>
<p>ana lyt i cal entry: An access point that is the title or name of a part of
a work, or a sep arate part that belongs to a series.
</p>
<p>area: The part of the descrip tion that con tains cer tain pieces of infor -
mation. For exam ple, title and state ment of responsibility make up an
area; edi tion state ment is an area.
</p>
<p>chief source of infor mation: The source the cat aloger uses that pro -
vides the infor mation for cat aloging the material. For exam ple, for a
book, the chief source is the title page of the book. For a videorecord-
ing, the chief source is the title frames or the information printed on
its con tainer.
</p>
<p>com piler: A per son who pre pares for the pub lication of a work by
putting pieces of related works together. The pieces may be writ ten
by the same author or by sev eral authors.
</p>
<p>diorama: A three-dimen sional min iature scene, such as fig ures in a
back ground set ting.
</p>
<p>27</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>edi tor: A per son who did not write or pro duce the material but is
responsible for it. The edi tor sometimes writes com mentaries or an
introduction to the work. 
</p>
<p>explan a tory ref er ence: A ref erence with a detailed expla nation on
other access points that the user may want to con sult.
</p>
<p>gen eral mate rial des ig na tion: Abbre vi ated as GMD, this indicates
to what cat egory the mate rial belongs, as far as format is con cerned.
Terms such as video recording, slide, and music, are used for the gen -
eral mate rial des ig na tion.
</p>
<p>kit: Two dif ferent types of media com bined as one unit, such as film -
strip and audiocassette, slide and book let.
</p>
<p>main entry: An access point used to identify a work. In the card envi-
ronment, the main entry card con tains the complete bib liographic
information. For a book, the main entry is usu ally the author. If cat a-
loged on a com puter, all access points can be retrieved the same way;
therefore, dis tinguishing between the main and added entries
becomes unim por tant.
</p>
<p>micro form: Microimages of materials pro duced on neg ative or pos i-
tive films. The most common ones are micro film (on reel) and micro-
fiche (on 4 &times; 6-inch film) for mats. An appro priate machine, the micro-
film/fiche reader/printer, is nec essary when using micro form.
</p>
<p>name-title ref er ence: As an access point, a reference that includes
both the name of the author and the title of the work. 
</p>
<p>phys i cal descrip tion: A step in the cataloging pro cess that involves
describing the material phys ically, such as num ber of pages of the
book, its size in centimeters, or the length of run ning time in the case
of videorecordings and sound record ings.
</p>
<p>realia: Artifact or object used in every day liv ing, such as a game or toy.
</p>
<p>see also reference: A ref erence that directs the user from one term or
name to other related terms or names.
</p>
<p>see ref er ence: A ref erence that directs the user from terms or names
that are not used to terms and names that are used.

<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>As ex plained in Chapter 3, de scriptive cataloging is the first step in 
cat a log ing li brary ma te ri als. De scrip tive cat a log ing in volves de scrib -
ing the ma terial first, then deciding the entries to complete the pro-
cess. For the pur pose of con sistency, a ref erence book ti tled An glo-
Amer i can Cat a loguing Rules, Sec ond Edi tion, 1998 Re vi sion
(AACR2R) has been com piled and adopted by most li braries. This
book in cludes the rules that ev ery li brary must fol low when per form-
ing de scriptive cataloging. The rules were put to gether, and the book
pre pared, by the Amer i can Li brary As so ci a tion, the Aus tra lian Com-
mit tee on Cat a loging, the Brit ish Li brary, the Ca na dian Com mit tee
on Cat aloging, The Library As sociation (Great Britain), and the Li-
brary of Con gress. Be cause of au tomation and the utilization of large
central da tabases, more and more li braries have come to re alize the ad -
vantage of con forming to the standards of the AACR2R rules. When a
library joins as a member of a con sortium, the li brary takes on the re -
spon si bil ity of cat a log ing ma te ri als ac cord ing to AACR2R rules.
</p>
<p>When the first edition of the An glo-Amer i can Cat a loguing Rules
was pub lished in 1967, most libraries be gan to cat alog ac cording to
</p>
<p>Descriptive Cataloging 29</p>

<p>these rules. Al though many changes were made in the second edi tion,
published in 1978, it was not un til 1981 that li braries to tally adopted
these new rules. The re vised sec ond edi tion was pub lished in 1988,
and again re vised in 1998. This latest edi tion is the appropriate one to
use and is the one dis cussed in this chap ter. No fun damental or philo-
sophical changes oc curred in the 1998 edition.

<p>Let us now look at AACR2R. As a li brary tech nician, you will be do -
ing copy cat a log ing most of the time. You will be re trieving needed in -

complete your cataloging tasks. In the oc casional case when you can not
find the ma terial al ready cat aloged by some one else, you will need to
perform orig inal cat aloging, which means that you must de termine the
information needed by technically reading the item you are cataloging.
Technical read ing means that you would look at the ti tle page, the copy -
right page, and the ta ble of con tents and per haps read a little bit into the
chapters to de termine the sub ject matter of the book and to get all the
necessary in formation. You need to know ex actly how the information
is or ganized to transfer that in formation onto cards or to enter the in for-
mation into the com puter da tabase, if your li brary has on line cataloging.
AACR2R spells out the rules for per forming this task.
</p>
<p>Besides the print edition, AACR2R is also avail able elec tron i cally
on a CD-ROM ti tled AACR2R-e, and is in cluded on an other CD-
ROM ver sion, Cat a loger&rsquo;s Desk top, together with some other pub li-
cations that are used as ref erences in cataloging. Al though you need
not mem orize all of the rules in AACR2R, it is nec essary to fa miliar-
ize your self with the ba sic rules, those which will be used daily when
cataloging ma terials. For the more spe cialized rules, you need to
know that they ex ist, and how to find the ex act rule that ap plies to
your case, ei ther through the table of con tents or the in dex.
</p>
<p>In this chap ter, the more ba sic rules listed in AACR2R are ex plained.
Keep in mind that these are only some of the rules. For more spe cialized,
less fre quently used rules, AACR2R should be con sulted di rectly. Any
book on the sub ject of cataloging is not a sub stitute for AACR2R, and as
a mem ber of the cat aloging staff, you must ac quire a copy of the lat est
edition of AACR2R, which is the 1998 re vision, as your sourcebook.

<p>ANGLO-AMERICAN CATALOGUING RULES,
SECOND EDITION, 1998 REVISION
</p>
<p>An glo-Amer i can Cat a loguing Rules, Second Edi tion, 1998 Re vi-
sion, or AACR2R for short, is di vided into two parts.
</p>
<p>Part I is ti tled De scrip tion. In the first thirteen chap ters, detailed
rules and for mats are carefully ex plained for phys ically de scribing
books, pam phlets, car to graphic ma te ri als, manu scripts, mu sic, sound
re cord ings, mo tion pic tures and videorecordings, graphic ma te ri als,
com puter files, three-di men sional ar ti facts and realia, mi cro forms,
se ri als, and anal y sis. 
</p>
<p>Part II is ti tled Head ings, Uni form Ti tles, and Ref er ences. In Chap -
ters 21 through 26, the fol lowing rules are found: choice of ac cess
point, head ings for per sons, geo graphic names, head ings for cor po-
rate bod ies, uni form ti tles, and ref erences. A close study of each
chapter will pro vide a com plete ex planation of each rule.
</p>
<p>Chapters 14 through 20 are re served to pro vide room for fu ture ex -
pansion of the rules.
</p>
<p>The ap pendixes sec tion of the book cov ers (A) Cap i tal iza tion,
(B) Ab bre vi a tion, (C) Numerals, (D) Glos sary. It is essential that ways
to cap i tal ize, to ab breviate, and to write out num bers, as de tailed in Ap -
pendixes A, B, and C, are fol lowed. Ap pendix D, the glos sary, will as -
sist be ginners to more readily un derstand the text.
</p>
<p>The index sec tion in the back co mes in handy when a spe cific
question or prob lem sur faces. This sec tion links the term be ing
looked up to the rule num ber so that the appropriate rule can be lo -
cated and ap plied.
</p>
<p>In the fol lowing pages, rules are ex amined ac cording to their orig i-
nal se quence in the AACR2R. Rule num bers are iden tified for ref er-

<p>1. In formation for cat aloging is to be taken from the &ldquo;chief source
of in formation.&rdquo; The chief sources for dif ferent types of ma terials are
stated in the rel evant chap ters of AACR2R. If the chief source is lack -
ing, data can be taken from any source. (Rules 1.0 A1, 1.0 A2)
</p>
<p>2. The de scription is di vided into the fol lowing ar eas. Each area
may have more than one el ement.

<p>For ex am ple, Edi tion is an area. Pub li ca tion, dis tri bu tion, etc. is an -
other area, whereas Pub li ca tion is an el ement.
</p>
<p>3. These are the general guide lines for punc tuation.
</p>
<p>a. Precede each area by a full stop, space, dash, space (. &ndash; ),
unless the area begins a new paragraph.
</p>
<p>b. Use square brackets ([ ]) to indicate that data are taken from 
outside the prescribed sources.
</p>
<p>c. Use an ellipsis (. . .) to indicate the omission of part of the 
element.
</p>
<p>d. General material designation (GMD) is always enclosed in 
its own brackets ([ ]). (Rule 1.0 C) 
</p>
<p>4. To suit the needs of li braries large and small, lev els of de tail in the 
description are es tablished. A li brary should choose the level that is
most ap propriate to its size. Three levels are pre scribed in Rule 1.0 D.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a. &ldquo;First level&rdquo; of description includes the following elements:
</p>
<p>&bull; Title proper / first statement of responsibility, if different
from main entry heading in form or number or if there is
no main entry heading
</p>
<p>&bull; Edition statement
&bull; Material (or type of publication) specific details
&bull; First publisher, etc., date of publication, etc.
&bull; Extent of item
&bull; Note(s)
&bull; Standard number
</p>
<p>b. &ldquo;Second level&rdquo; of description contains more details:
</p>
<p>&bull; Title proper [general material designation] = Parallel title : 
other title information / first statement of responsibility ;
each subsequent statement of responsibility
</p>
<p>&bull; Edition statement / first statement of edition
&bull; Material (or type of publication) specific details
&bull; First place of publication, etc. : first publisher, etc., date

&bull; Note(s)
&bull; Standard number
</p>
<p>c. &ldquo;Third level&rdquo; of description includes all elements of the second 
level plus other information that is important for the library
user.
</p>
<p>Depending on the needs of each in dividual li brary, the ap propriate
level of de scription is cho sen. Usually small libraries choose the first
level of de scription, while medium li braries choose the sec ond level.
Only very large re search li braries or special li braries prac tice the
third level of de scription. Small li braries are re quired to do the sec-
ond level of de scription if they be long to a con sortium and have a
shared da tabase with other li braries.
</p>
<p>AACR2R con tains the de tails for each area of de scriptive cat alog-
ing, starting with the ti tle state ment. Rules reg ulating all of the ar eas
are summarized in the fol lowing sec tions.

AACR2R. For each chap ter, only the most com monly used fea tures
are dis cussed. These rules do not in clude all pos sible sit uations en -
countered when do ing de scriptive cataloging. For items that con tain
specific fea tures not cov ered in this text, AACR2R should be con -

<p>Chapter 12 lists rules for cataloging se rials. Se rial is de fined here
as any ti tle that is pub lished con tinuously and in tended to be pub -
lished in definitely. Se rials are al ways dated or num bered in se -
quence. The interval may be regular, such as weekly mag azines, daily 
news pa pers, an nu als, etc., or ir reg u lar, such as oc ca sional pa pers and
monographic se ries. The chief source of in formation for printed se ri-
als is the ti tle page of the first is sue of the se rial. If the first is sue is not
available, the first avail able is sue is used. Even though many smaller
libraries do not cat alog se rials, li brary tech nicians still have to learn
about se rial cataloging be cause ev ery li brary sub scribes to many con -
tinuous pub lications, such as the al manac, an nual guides, etc., that
need to be cataloged. The na ture of the se rial is very dif ferent from all
the me dia we have dis cussed so far. Be cause of its unique ness, it is
important for li brary tech nicians to gain knowl edge on how to cat a-
log se rials. Some of the important points are sum marized here. For
nonprint se rials, fol low the rules for the particular medium. For ex -
ample, for elec tronic jour nals, use the des ignated rules for com puter
files in Chap ter 9. (Rules 12.1, 12.3, 12.5, 12.7)

<p>Whether work ing on cards or on the computer, the same AACR2R
rules are to be followed. This means that even though the card and the
online catalog look very dif ferent, cat aloging is done the same way by
following the same rules. It is eas ier to cat alog on line be cause there is a 
standard form, called the MARC for mat, that shows on the screen. The
cataloger fills in the in formation for each sep arate line, un der a dif fer-
ent code num ber called a &ldquo;field,&rdquo; cor responding to the chief source of
information for the item, and then fol lows the prescribed way to en ter
the in formation. More on cat aloging on the com puter is ex plained in
Chap ter 8.
</p>
<p>Both in the pro cess of rou tine cataloging and when un usual prob -

<p>Many more rules are listed in Chap ter 24 of AACR2R. If in doubt,
consult the book for the correct form for the corporate head ings.
</p>
<p>Uniform Titles (Chapter 25)
</p>
<p>Some works are pub lished un der var ious ti tles. The case may be a
different edi tion of the book or a translation of a work into a different
language. It may also be a col lection of dif ferent works. There is a
need to bring all var ious ti tles to gether. AACR2R con tains rules in
Chapter 25 to take care of these sit uations by us ing what is called uni -
form ti tle. Uni form ti tle means one ti tle is cho sen for all vari ations of
the ti tles, so that all ti tles are listed to gether in the cat alog. Different
editions of a work, even though titles vary, are not con sidered to be in
this cat egory. For dif ferent edi tions, new en tries must be made.
</p>
<p>1. Se lect one ti tle as the uniform ti tle if the work ap pears in var ious
titles. En close the uni form ti tle in square brackets be fore the ti tle
proper. For a ti tle en try, it is op tional whether or not to use the brack-
ets. (Rule 25.2 A)
</p>
<p>Examples: Dickens, Charles
[Pickwick papers]
</p>
<p>The posthumous papers of the Pickwick Club
Arabian nights
</p>
<p>One thousand and one nights
</p>
<p>2. If a part of the work has a title of its own, use the ti tle of the part
as the uni form ti tle. Make a &ldquo;see&rdquo; reference for the head ing of the
</p>
<p>54 Cataloging and Classification for Library Technicians</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>whole work, and use the ti tle of the part as a sub heading. If the item
has a con secutive num ber, use it as part of the sub heading for the uni -
form ti tle. If the item con sists of three or more un numbered parts, use
the uni form ti tle for the whole work fol lowed by Se lec tions. (Rules

<p>Chapter 5
</p>
<p>Subject Headings
</p>
<p>So far, you have stud ied the first two steps in cat aloging: de scrip-
tive cataloging and choos ing main and added en tries. Now you are
ready to take the third step: as signing sub ject headings.
</p>
<p>In search ing for in formation or do ing re search, a spe cific au thor or
title of ten is not a pri mary con sideration. Rather, most li brary us ers
attempt to discover ma terials in a particular field by first check ing un -
der the ap propriate sub ject. Thus, the task of as signing sub ject head-
ings to ma terials takes on great im portance. The pur pose of as signing
subject head ings is to list all the materials on a given subject un der a
uniform term or phrase, so that in one search library us ers not only
will be able to iden tify all the ma terials on a topic owned by the li -
brary, but also will find them side by side on the shelves. As with
choosing main and added en tries, dis cussed in Chap ter 4, as signing
subject head ings also creates more ac cess points for a work.
</p>
<p>A sub ject heading may be a term; name of a per son, group, or
place; or a phrase. Ob viously, many dif ferent terms can be ap plied to
every sub ject. For ex ample, the term movie can be called mo tion pic -
ture, cin ema, film, and mov ing pic ture. If the choice and as signing
system were left to the in dividual cat aloger, or to the in dividual li -
brary, con fusion would re sult. Sim ilar to the use of rules for de scrip-
tive cataloging and for de ciding main and added en tries, ref erence
books are used to main tain uni formity in assigning sub ject headings.
Library of Con gress Sub ject Head ings is used by large li braries and
network li braries, large or small. Some smaller public li braries and
school li braries use the sec ond ref erence book for this pur pose, Sears
List of Sub ject Head ings.
</p>
<p>In de termining what sub ject headings to as sign, the li brary tech ni-
cian should first de termine what the ma terial is about by, for ex ample,
in the case of a book, read ing or look ing at the book it self, its ta ble of
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>contents, or the blurb on the jacket. The title is of ten un informative or
misleading, and not a good source to use in try ing to fig ure out the
main topic of the ma terial. Sometimes a more thor ough examination is
needed to completely un derstand what sub jects the material cov ers. In
such cases, more in-depth study of the ma terial be comes nec essary. If
the sub ject still is not ap parent, then ref erences should be used, or a
subject spe cialist should be con sulted. Some times the lan guage of the
material is so spe cific, as in the case of foreign publications, that a lan -
guage spe cialist should be con sulted.
</p>
<p>After the subject is de termined, ei ther Library of Con gress Sub ject
Head ings or Sears List of Sub ject Head ings is con sulted to find the uni -
form term that then be comes the sub ject heading. This sub ject heading
is ei ther put on the bottom part of the cat alog card, with an Arabic num -
bered se quence, or in put onto the computer screen us ing the MARC
format (see Chap ter 8) 6XX fields des ignated for sub ject headings. For 
example, per sonal name headings are tagged 600, corporate name
headings are tagged 610, topical head ings are tagged 650, and geo -
graphical headings are tagged 651. Fig ure 5.1 shows the two sub ject
headings printed on the bot tom of the card: Pro cessing (Li braries)&mdash;
Man age ment and Li brary Ad min is tra tion.

<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>author ity file: A set of the estab lished author itative forms of head -
ings, accord ing to the Library of Con gress or the local library, used in 
cataloging for input ting bib liographic records and for mak ing ref er-
ences to and from the head ings. A file of all the estab lished sub ject
headings is called the sub ject author ity file. A file of all the estab-
lished names is called the name author ity file. A file of all the estab-
lished series tiles is called the series authority file. A card cat alog can
serve as the author ity file. The com puterized catalog usu ally has
built-in authority files gen erated by the Library of Con gress. Any
bibliographic utility or com mercial library ser vice com pany may pro -
vide an author ity file.
</p>
<p>BT: Stands for broader topic(s). Broader topics are listed so that the
user can find more related infor mation on the sub ject.
</p>
<p>free-float ing sub di vi sion: A list of sub divisions and how they may
be applied in con junction with sub ject headings.
</p>
<p>NT: Stands for nar rower topic(s). Terms listed under NT are more
specific and may add in-depth mate rials for the researcher.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>pat tern head ing: For each cat egory of sub ject heading, a stan dard-
ized set of sub divisions is devel oped. To save space, these sub divi-
sions are printed under only one sub ject heading belong ing to the
category, and this sub ject heading is called a pat tern head ing.
</p>
<p>RT: Lists the related topic(s). These are other sub ject headings that in 
some man ner relate to the topic.
</p>
<p>SA: This is a &ldquo;see also&rdquo; ref erence that refers the user to an entire
group of addi tional headings.
</p>
<p>scope note: A note under the sub ject heading to explain and clar ify
how the term should be used, and not ing what is included and what is
not included when the term is used.
</p>
<p>sub ject sub di vi sion: Words or phrases fol lowing a sub ject heading
after a dash that make the sub ject more spe cific. The sub division may 
be top i cal, a phys i cal form, geo graph ical, or chro no log i cal.
</p>
<p>UF: Means &ldquo;used for,&rdquo; which is oppo site from USE. The term before
UF is the cho sen head ing. The one listed after ward is not to be used.
</p>
<p>USE: Indi cates that the term listed is not to be used because it is not a
uniform term that has been cho sen as a legit imate term. The term
listed after &ldquo;USE&rdquo; should be used instead.

<p>LIBRARY OF CONGRESS SUBJECT HEADINGS
</p>
<p>Now in its twenty-sec ond edi tion, pub lished in 1999, Li brary of
Con gress Sub ject Head ings, or LCSH for short, has a more than one-
hun dred-year his tory of de vel op ment. It is an ac cu mu la tion of sub ject 
headings es tablished by the Library of Con gress since 1898 and is the 
most com prehensive list of sub ject headings in the world, used by
thousands of li braries as well as com mercial in dexes. It pro vides an
al pha bet i cal list of all sub ject head ings, cross-ref er ences, and sub di -

</p>
<p>A new edi tion of Library of Con gress Sub ject Head ings is pub lished
every year. The latest edi tion is in five vol umes, usu ally re ferred to by
library staff as &ldquo;the big red books.&rdquo; To keep in formation cur rent, a

ditions, de letions, or changes of sub ject headings, which have been
examined, dis cussed, and ap proved by the ed itorial board composed
of the Li brary of Con gress staff and rep resentatives from the library
world. An other way to keep up with the changes and up dates of all the
Li brary of Con gress pub li ca tions, in clud ing LCSH, is through sub scrip-
tion to the electronic publication LC Cat a loging Newsline (LCCN). This 
title is pub lished ir regularly and is available free of charge in electronic

lar ba sis. Head ings to be used are listed in bold faced type. Sub ject
headings come in different forms and lengths. The head ings may be
just one word, such as Art, or may be two words, usu ally an ad jective
and a noun, such as Art stu dents. Headings may ap pear in in verted
form, such as Art, Amer i can. A head ing may be fol lowed by the leg -
end (May Subd Geog). For broad top ics, sub divisions ap ply, such as
Art&mdash;Study and teaching. Sometimes head ings may in clude con -
junctions and prep ositional phrases, such as Art and lit er a ture and
Art in lit er a ture, or they may be a per son&rsquo;s name, a cor porate body&rsquo;s 
name, or a geo graphical name. Al though these ex amples dem onstrate
varied forms and struc tures, a care ful and pa tient search will match
what is be ing cat aloged and, thus, the proper pro cedure will come into
ef fect. Ac cord ing to LCSH, 36 per cent of head ings are fol lowed by Li -
brary of Con gress Clas sification num bers. Stu dents are warned, how -
ever, that the class num bers are of fered as a guide only, and, there fore,
ver i fi ca tion in the Li brary of Con gress Clas si fi ca tion Sched ules is nec -
es sary.
</p>
<p>Some gen eral prin ci ples for as sign ing and con struct ing sub ject
head ings ac cord ing to Library of Con gress Sub ject Head ings and Sub-
ject Cat a loging Man ual: Sub ject Head ings in clude the fol low ing:
</p>
<p>1. Assign one or more subject headings that best summarize the
contents of the work. The heading must represent at least 20 percent
of the work.
</p>
<p>2. Assign as many headings as needed.
3. Assign headings that are as specific as the topics of the work. If
</p>
<p>precise headings are not possible, assign broader or more general
headings.
</p>
<p>4. Assign a more general heading if the heading includes two or
three related topics in the work and the heading represents no
other topics.
</p>
<p>Subject Headings 67</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5. If the work is about two or three topics and the general heading
includes more than these topics, assign the two or three specific
headings.
</p>
<p>6. If there are four subtopics, assign four specific headings instead
of a general heading.
</p>
<p>7. Use names of persons, families, corporate bodies, projects,
places, etc., as subject headings. Check any name authority file
for the proper spelling, order, etc.
</p>
<p>8. When more than one subject heading is chosen, the first one
should represent the main topic of the item.
</p>
<p>To as sign ap pro pri ate sub ject head ings to ma te ri als is most im por tant
because most li brary users re trieve ma terials by subject. If the as signed
subject headings are too broad, too many not-so-use ful ma terials may be 
retrieved. On the contrary, if they are too nar row, not enough in forma-
tion can be retrieved. Many more rules ex ist for as signing sub ject head-
ings than those cited here. Con sult Sub ject Head ing Man ual: Sub ject
Head ings for ad ditional information. One has to keep in mind that Li -
brary of Congress pol icy and prac tice on as signing sub ject headings
was de signed for the card catalog en vironment, and, therefore, min i-
mal re dun dancy was re quired. In an au to mated en vi ron ment, how-
ever, it is con venient to increase the num ber of sub ject headings and
to build in any de gree of re dundancy, with the intention of rep resent-
ing the subject com pletely.
</p>
<p>In Library of Con gress Sub ject Head ings, under each head ing, the
conditions of use are ex plained through five kinds of ref erences.
</p>
<p>1. Scope note. Scope note fol lows the head ing im mediately to en-
sure con sistency of sub ject us age. Scope note clarifies the range of
subject matter to which a heading is ap plied. It also brings at tention to 
the dis tinc tions be tween re lated head ings.
</p>
<p>Ex am ple: Art (May Subd Geog)
</p>
<p>Here are en tered gen eral works on the vi sual arts. Works on the

arts, are en tered un der Arts.

<p>2. USE and UF ref er ences. The USE ref erence is made from an un-
authorized term to an au thorized term. USE fol lows the un authorized
heading, but pre cedes the au thorized one. UF, which stands for &ldquo;used
for,&rdquo; is the op posite of USE and co mes be tween the au thorized head -
ing and the un authorized one. USE is com monly called a see ref er -
ence, which is made for syn onyms, vari ant spell ings, and dif ferent
head ing con struc tions.

<p>3. BT and NT. BT is for broader top ics and NT is for nar rower top -
ics. By us ing head ings un der BT, one can find materials more gen eral
than the one originally checked. In the same sense, NT sug gests more
spe cific head ings.

ing any use ful re lationship other than BT and/or NT. It links two
headings that are associated in some man ner.
</p>
<p>Ex am ple: Art

</p>
<p>Complex top ics in many cases are listed with sub divisions. Sub-di -
visions ex ist to ex press dif ferent con cepts or per spectives of the
topic. A sub division fol lows a dash (&ndash;) un der the head ing. If two sub -
divisions are used, the sec ond one fol lows the first one with two
dashes (&ndash; &ndash;).
</p>
<p>Ex am ple: Art

</p>
<p>Using this ex ample, the complete sub ject heading should be:
</p>

</p>
<p>Or, if it is on the computer screen, it would look like this:
</p>
<p>650 0 Art $x Private collections $z Italy

<p>Some sub divisions are listed and can be found in the text of LCSH,
while oth ers may be as signed ac cording to the rules spec ified in the
Library of Con gress Sub ject Head ings Man ual: Sub ject Head ings.
There are four cat e go ries of sub di vi sions.
</p>
<p>1. Top i cal subdivisions are used to limit the con cept of the topic.
Following is how it will appear on a card and in MARC for mat on the
com puter screen:
</p>
<p>Ex am ple: Art&ndash;Mar keting

<p>2. Form sub divisions rep resent what a work is as far as form is
concerned, not what the work is about.

<p>4. Geo graphic sub di vi sions in di cate the geo graphic lo ca tion. In struc -
tion for the use of geo graphic sub divisions ap pears af ter the heading in a
scope note or is in dicated by (May Subd Geog), which means may be
sub di vided geo graph i cally. Rules for list ing geo graphic sub di vi sions are
outlined in the Library of Con gress Sub ject Head ings Man ual: Sub ject
Head ings. Generally, the es tablished name of the coun try is used if the 
material is about a coun try. If the geo graphic en tity is a re gion or a
city, then the name of the coun try pre cedes the name of the re gion or
city. The exception is for the United States, Great Britain, Can ada,
and the for mer So viet Un ion, where the name of the coun try is not
used.
</p>
<p>Ex am ple: Art&ndash;France
650 0 Art $z France
Art&ndash;New York
650 0 Art $z New York
</p>
<p>To avoid re peat ing sub di vi sions un der all pos si ble head ings of the
same cat egory, such as sports, dis eases, or mu sical in struments, the
Library of Con gress Sub ject Head ings es tab lished ta bles re ferred to as
&ldquo;Table of Pat tern Head ings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Free-Floating Sub divisions&rdquo; ap pro-
priate for the same cat egory. These pat tern head ings ap pear in a ta ble in
LCSH.
</p>
<p>Examples: Category Pattern Heading
Musical instrument Piano
Diseases Cancer
</p>
<p>These ex am ples mean that when as sign ing sub di vi sions for Sax o -
phone, the pat tern for Pi ano is used since both be long to the musical
in stru ment cat e gory. When try ing to find sub di vi sions for Heart At -
tack, one has to look un der Can cer and use the same sub divisions.

be con sulted for what sub divisions are avail able and how they may be 
used.
</p>

clude head ings that ap pear in the following name au thority files: Name

</p>
<p>&ldquo;The An notated Card Pro gram: AC Sub ject Head ings&rdquo; sec tion in the
LCSH lists sub ject headings used ex clusively for the ju venile col lection,
tailored to the needs of chil dren and young adults. Some headings are
standard sub ject headings taken from the main vol ume of LCSH, some
are mod ified sub ject headings from the same source, and some are new
headings es tablished to use only when as signing sub ject headings to ju -
ve nile lit er a ture with spe cial sub di vi sions. These spe cial sub di vi sions in-
clude Bi og ra phy, Col lec tions, Fic tion, Guides, Habits and be hav ior,

scope, such as Art and Music.
</p>
<p>3. For classes of persons, geographic subdivision is omitted, such

<p>SEARS LIST OF SUBJECT HEADINGS
</p>
<p>Sears List of Sub ject Head ings was de veloped to meet the needs of
small to me dium-sized li braries. The lat est edi tion, the sixteenth, was
published in 1997 by the H. W. Wil son Com pany. Some use ful sug -
gestions and point ers on how to use this book to find the appropriate
subject head ings are stated in a sec tion ti tled &ldquo;Principles of the Sears
List of Sub ject Head ings.&rdquo; Gen erally speak ing, the fol lowing are the
most ba sic:
</p>
<p>1. Assign a specific and direct heading. For example, use Penguins,
not Birds. Use Orange, not Citrus. But if the material contains
information about oranges, lemons, and other kinds of citrus
fruits, use Citrus Fruit.
</p>
<p>2. Apply common usage. For example, use Labor, not Labour. Use
Elevators, not Lifts.
</p>
<p>3. Use terms that are uniform. For example, use Porcelain, not
China, or Chinaware.
</p>
<p>4. Form headings such as Essays, Poetry, Fiction, Hymns, and
Songs are used under Collection only, not under individual
authors.

<p>Gram mar of Sears subject headings in cludes sin gle and com pound
nouns, ad jectives with nouns, and phrase headings. Sim ilar to the Li-
brary of Con gress Sub ject Head ings, Sears also has four kinds of
sub di vi sions: phys i cal form, spe cial as pect or topic, chro nol ogy, and
place.
</p>
<p>Symbols used in the six teenth edition of Sears List of Sub ject
Head ings are the same as those used in the Library of Con gress Sub -
ject Head ings. These in clude UF, SA, BT, NT, and RT, and they
maintain the same mean ings as explained ear lier in this chap ter when
dis cuss ing the Library of Con gress Sub ject Head ings. The Sears also
uses (May Sub Geog) to in dicate  that the head ing may be sub divided
geographically, and a gen eral scope note explaining the head ing may
im me di ately fol low the head ing.
</p>
<p>Libraries usu ally have local rules on the max imum num ber of sub -
ject headings as signed to an item, which are typed on the bot tom of
cards fol lowing an Arabic num ber. In au tomated libraries, any num -
ber of the de sired sub ject headings are keyed into the 6XX fields for
sub ject head ings. See and See also cards need to be typed for li braries
with man ual cat a log ing. In most au to mated li brar ies, the sub ject au-
thority files are al ready es tablished by the ven dor or the bib liographic
utility, and, therefore, the cat aloging staff need not manually de ter-
mine all in di vid ual ref er ences.
</p>
<p>Other fea tures in the Sears List of Sub ject Head ings with which the 
library tech nician needs to be fa miliar in clude &ldquo;Head ings to Be
Added by the Cat aloger,&rdquo; &ldquo;Key Head ings,&rdquo;  and &ldquo;List of Commonly
Used Sub di vi sions,&rdquo; among oth ers. Sears List of Sub ject Head ings is 
also in electronic for mat, to which libraries may sub scribe through
the Wil son Da ta base Li censing Ser vice.
</p>
<p>After most of the Sears headings, one can find one or two sug -
gested Dewey num bers for the topic taken from the Abridged Dewey
Dec i mal Clas si fi ca tion and Rel a tive In dex.

<p>Figure 5.5 shows the top of a page from Sears List of Sub ject

mated libraries, many con sortia now re quire their members to use the

<p>Chapter 6
</p>
<p>Classification
</p>
<p>Before the clas sification system is discussed, let us re view the
steps in volved in the cataloging pro cess so that it is clear where the
task of clas sification be longs. Re call the first step of cat aloging,
called de scrip tive cat a log ing, is performed ac cording to the rules in
AACR2R. Within this step, we have learned how to phys ically de -
scribe the material at hand, and how to de termine the main en try and
the added en tries. Then we con tinued to the sec ond step, called sub-
ject cat a log ing. The task of sub ject cataloging in cludes two parts: as -
sign ing sub ject head ings and as sign ing clas si fi ca tion num bers. Chap-
ter 5 ex plained the pro cess of as signing sub ject headings to ma terials.
Now we are ready for the dis cussion on clas sification.
</p>
<p>In su per mar kets or in stores, a clas si fi ca tion sys tem ar ranges all
the same and re lated merchandise to gether on the shelves so that it is
easier for the cus tomers to find what they want. In a li brary, this ob -
jective is even more im portant. First of all, the clas sification system is 
im por tant be cause the clas si fi ca tion num ber, com bined with the au-
thor num ber, forms a unique no tation that be comes the lo cation sym -
bol for the ma terial. This &ldquo;address&rdquo; makes it con venient for li brary
users to find the materials on the shelves. In ad dition, the sys tem is
designed so that ma terials of the same sub ject are grouped to gether
on the shelves, with re lated sub jects nearby for easy brows ing. More -
over, with the unique lo cation sym bol la beled on the spine, the li brary
staff can easily shelve the ma terial in its proper place af ter each use.
Whether a library tech nician works in the cataloging de partment or in 
pub lic ser vices, a thor ough knowl edge of a li brary&rsquo;s clas si fi ca tion
scheme is es sential to better serve li brary users. A classification sys-
tem pro vides a pow erful tool to extract in formation not only from the
library cat alogs but from the global in formation net work as well.
</p>
<p>79</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Dif fer ent clas si fi ca tion sys tems have been de signed for adop tion
by li braries, but only two have been uni versally adopted: the Dewey
Dec i mal Clas si fi ca tion sys tem and the Li brary of Con gress Clas si fi -
cation sys tem. The library tech nician needs to un derstand these clas-
sification sys tems in or der to as sign num bers cor rectly to the ma ter-
ials, and also to help us ers lo cate materials. A li brary usu ally uses one 
sys tem ex clu sively.
</p>
<p>Gen erally speak ing, most ac a demic li brar ies and spe cial li brar ies
use the Li brary of Con gress Clas sification sys tem. Most pub lic li-
brar ies and school li brar ies use the Dewey Dec i mal Clas si fi ca tion
system. Many ac ademic li braries switched from the Dewey sys tem to 
the Li brary of Con gress sys tem in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
and, there fore, in these libraries, both sys tems may be in op eration.
Some older books will still carry Dewey num bers, while the newer
acquisitions will have the Li brary of Con gress num bers.
</p>
<p>The pre lim i nary pro cesses for as sign ing a clas si fi ca tion num ber to
the ma terial are the same as assigning sub ject head ings, as dis cussed
in Chap ter 5. First of all, one has to know ex actly to what sub ject field
the ma terial be longs by care fully ex amining the ta ble of con tents, the
preface, or even the text of the ma terial. For au diovisual ma terials, if
the la bels or the con tainers do not sup ply enough in formation for
making a de cision, the li brary tech nician should listen to or view the
contents. In some ex tremely difficult cases, one may have to con sult
sub ject spe cial ists.
</p>
<p>Whereas several sub ject head ings can be assigned to a single item, the 
classification num ber has a limit of one. If an item deals with sev eral
subjects, the dominant one should be used. If the dom inant sub ject can-
not be de cided, the first men tioned should be used. If the item deals with
more than three sub jects, a broader, inclusive sub ject should be chosen.
Af ter the sub ject mat ter is de ter mined, the clas si fi ca tion sched ule used
by the li brary is con sulted, and the number or no tation that ap propriately
describes the item&rsquo;s subject mat ter is chosen.
</p>
<p>In this chap ter, both the Dewey Decimal Clas sification system and
the Li brary of Con gress Clas si fi ca tion sys tem will be ex am ined and
explained in detail, together with ex amples.

<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>author num ber: See BOOK NUM BER.
</p>
<p>book num ber: A let ter and num ber com bination assigned to a par ticu-
lar book rep resenting the author. Com bined with the clas sification
number, it forms a unique sym bol. This ensures that books on the same
subject will be shelved side by side, alphabetically by authors&rsquo; last
names. Book num ber is also called author num ber or cut ter num ber.
</p>
<p>call num ber: The loca tion, or the address, of an item on the shelves.
The call num ber is a com bination of the classification num ber and the 
book num ber. Some times other nota tions such as vol ume num ber,
notation rep resenting the title, and other sym bols are assigned by the
cataloger so that each item has a unique nota tion. This notation is
called a call number&mdash;the num ber to call for the mate rial.
</p>
<p>cut ter num ber: See also BOOK NUM BER. Book num bers are derived
from a ref erence book titled Cut ter-Sanborn Three-Fig ure Author
Table and are there fore called the Cut ter num ber. Two other ver sions
of this book are titled C. A. Cut ter&rsquo;s Three-Fig ure Author Table and
Cutter&rsquo;s Two-Fig ure Author Table.
</p>
<p>nota tion: A num ber or num ber and let ter com bination that is pre -
scribed in the clas si fi ca tion scheme.

<p>DEWEY DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
</p>
<p>The Dewey Dec imal Clas sification system is the most widely used
classification system in the world. This ref erence tool, called DDC in
short, now in its twenty-first edition, pub lished in 1996, con tains four 
volumes. As stated in the introduction to the Dewey Clas sification,
this sys tem is used by over 200,000 libraries in 135 coun tries and has
been trans lated into over thirty for eign lan guages. In the United
States, 95 per cent of all pub lic and school libraries, 25 per cent of all
college and uni versity li braries, and 20 per cent of spe cial libraries use 
this sys tem. Var i ous bib lio graphic util i ties and on line ser vices use
the DDC system as their re trieval tool.

<p>A de tailed discussion of the four vol umes of DDC 21 fol lows. Vol -
ume one is ti tled In tro duc tion. Ta bles. The use of this ref erence book
and the prin ciples of this clas sification scheme are ex plained in the in -
troduction sec tion. Some main con cepts are es pecially important to re -
member. The ba sic classes are ar ranged by tra ditional ac ademic dis-
ciplines, not by sub ject. A given sub ject may be found in more than one 
place, de pending on the dif ferent as pects of the sub ject. For ex ample, a
book on the topic of Internet may be given dif fer ent clas si fi ca tion
num bers, ac cord ing to DDC 21. The num ber 004.678 is used if the
book is an in terdisciplinary work about the Internet and con tains in for-
mation about computer hard ware. If the book does not con tain much
information about computer sci ence, but the em phasis is on search and
retrieval, number 025.04 would be used. For works that de scribe
Internet in for ma tion re sources de voted to spe cific dis ci plines and
subjects, 025.06 is as signed, and, fi nally, works on Internet access
pro vid ers and works on eco nomic and pub lic pol icy is sues con cerning
the Internet are clas sified as 384.33.
</p>
<p>The en tire world of knowl edge is di vided into ten main classes.
The ten classes are fur ther di vided into ten di visions, and each di vi-
sion is di vided into ten sec tions. All clas sification num bers are three-
digit num bers, such as 000, 130, 269, etc. In the three-digit number,
the first digit in dicates the main class, the sec ond digit in dicates the
division, and the third digit in dicates the sec tion. Fol lowing the three-
digit num ber is a dec imal point after which may be additional dig its
that more spe cifically de fine the sub ject.
</p>
<p>For ex ample, num ber 025.0 in dicates the main class Gen er al ities.
The mid dle num ber 2 in di cates di vi sion Li brary and in for ma tion sci-
ences, and num ber 5 in dicates the sec tion Op er a tions of li brar ies, ar-
chives, in for ma tion cen ters. To be more spe cific, the num ber 025.43
as the clas sification num ber for a book in dicates that the book is
about li brary clas si fi ca tion sys tems.
</p>
<p>Seven ta bles used to limit the as pect of a sub ject are in cluded in
volume one of DDC 21. For ex amples, from Ta ble 1, &ldquo;Stan dard Sub di -
visions,&rdquo; num ber 092 in dicates per sons un der a main topic. From Ta -
ble 2, &ldquo;Geo graphic Areas, Pe riods, Per sons,&rdquo; number 73 means United 
States under a main topic. The same kind of ar rangement can be found
in Ta ble 3A, &ldquo;In dividual Au thors&rdquo;; Ta ble 3B, &ldquo;More Than One Au -

Persons.&rdquo; Please re member that num bers in the ta bles are never used
alone; they are al ways added to the classification num ber. For ex am-
ple, in num ber 810.8, 810 is Amer ican lit erature in Eng lish, the broad

the new edi tion: &ldquo;Re lo ca tions and Re duc tions&rdquo;; &ldquo;Com par a tive and
Equivalence Tables&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Reused Num bers.&rdquo; A new book needs to be 
classified with a new num ber, of course. De pending on the size of the
library, its bud get, and its staffing sit uation, some libraries may de cide
that it is not cost-ef ficient to reclassify older books, and only new ac -
quisitions will be clas sified ac cording to the twenty-first edi tion.
</p>
<p>Volumes two and three are ti tled The Sched ules, which are re ferred
to when de ter min ing the ap pro pri ate num ber for the ma te rial be ing
classified. The sched ules are di vided into ten cat egories of three-digit
numbers, as de scribed earlier. Three sum maries that are par tially re -
produced here give outlines of the or ganization.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.1 shows the &ldquo;First Sum mary,&rdquo; which di vides the knowl -
edge in the world into ten categories cor responding to dis cipline fields
of study. In per forming the task of classifying, one first must decide
which cat egory de scribes the topic most closely. For ex ample, for a
foreign lan guage dic tionary, 400 is the ap propriate class to choose.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.2, the &ldquo;Sec ond Sum mary,&rdquo; shows the di visions ap plied to
the sec ond num ber, called the hun dred di visions. This means that for
each of the classes in the &ldquo;First Sum mary,&rdquo; ten di visions are formed to
further break down the discipline to make it more spe cific. For ex am-
ple, for a book on ed ucation, it is first de cided that the field Ed u ca tion
belongs to the class of so cial sci ence 300. Fur ther ex amining the
&ldquo;Sec ond Sum mary&rdquo; will lead to num ber 370 for Ed ucation.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.3, the &ldquo;Third Sum mary&rdquo; for class num ber one, shows the
divisions ap plied to the third digit, called the thou sand sec tions. For in -
stance, a book on Higher Ed u ca tion will have the num ber 378, mean -
ing that the broad class is so cial sci ence, the division is ed ucation, and
the sec tion is higher education.
</p>
<p>Following the summaries are the main schedules in vol umes two
and three. Class 000 through class 500 are in cluded in volume two, and

</p>
<p>By check ing the main sched ules, one will find that more de tails

<p>Volume four is ti tled Rel a tive In dex. Man ual. The Rel a tive In dex
is the first place the cat aloger will go to find the ap proximate sched-
ule of details. For ex ample, if the ma terial is about the li brary&rsquo;s role in 
higher ed ucation, look ing in this vol ume un der the head ing Ed u ca -
tion, one would find 021.24 for this sub ject. If us ing vol ume two di -
rectly and checking un der Ed u ca tion in the so cial sci ence cat egory,
one would be hard-pressed to find the ap propriate num ber. Ref erence
notes will guide the DDC 21 users to the cor rect num ber. The sec ond
part, Man ual, explains the policies and prac tices of how the sched -
ules are de signed, up dated, and changed. Also, notes on the ta bles of -
fer help and sug gestions so that stu dents of cat aloging can get a clear
idea of how to per form the challenging task of as signing Dewey num -
bers to the ma terial at hand.

the Dewey summaries are checked to de termine the ap propriate
three-digit num ber to match the dis cipline. After that, the Sched ules,
either vol ume two or vol ume three, are con sulted to find the ex act
decimal num bers to use after the ini tial three-digit num ber. De-
pending on the topic and the ex planation fol lowing the num ber, a fur -
ther dec imal num ber from the ta ble may have to be added to com plete
the Dewey num ber. If un sure of the ap propriate num ber for the dis ci-
pline, one can al ways check the Rel a tive In dex of vol ume four, which
provides a guide to the ex act num ber in the main sched ules. Pay spe -
cial attention to the co pious notes that are included in the sched ules,
giving ex planations and di rections on how to build the num ber, how
to use the ta bles, and other important in structions.

<p>A shorter ver sion of DDC 21, ti tled Abridged Edi tion 13: Dewey
Dec i mal Clas si fi ca tion, is sim pler and is de signed for small li braries
with small col lections. The thirteenth edi tion, pub lished in 1997, is
based on the con tents of the DDC 21. 
</p>
<p>DDC 21 is also avail able in a CD-ROM for mat called Dewey for
Win dows. Au tomated libraries may use this ver sion, which of fers full-
text in dexing, full-text sched ules, a per sonal note pad, and Li brary of

<p>Between edi tions, the Dewey Clas sification sys tem is kept up to date
by an an nual pub lication from the For est Press ti tled Dewey Dec i mal
Clas si fi ca tion: Ad di tions, Notes and De ci sions, or DC&amp; for short. The
most cur rent new and changed entries are posted on the first day of each

</p>
<p>BOOK NUMBER FOR THE DDC
</p>
<p>The clas sification num ber alone is not suf ficient to make a unique
identification of each item in the li brary. In cat aloging, an ex tra step
is taken to as sign a book num ber, also re ferred to as the au thor num -
ber, or the Cut ter num ber. The com bination of the classification num -
ber and the book num ber gives ev ery item in the li brary a unique
notation that places the item in a spe cific lo cation. Fre quently, the no -
tation in cludes pre fixes, which are placed above the clas sification
numbers. The most com mon ones are Ref or Ref er ence for ref er ence
ma te ri als, J or Juv for ju ve nile ma te ri als, E or Easy for easy-read ing
collections, etc. This com bined no tation is called the call num ber,
which is what we see on the spine la bels of li brary ma terials.
</p>
<p>The book num ber starts with a dec imal point fol lowed by a let ter,
which is the first let ter of the au thor&rsquo;s last name. If there is no author,
the first let ter of the ti tle is of ten used. Following the let ter is a numer-
ical value that rep resents the al phabetical or der of the au thor&rsquo;s last
name. Be cause many items may bear the same Dewey clas sification
number, the book num ber al lows items on the same sub ject to be
shelved al pha bet i cally by au thor&rsquo;s last name.
</p>
<p>The three ver sions of the ref erence tool for as signing the book num ber
are C. A. Cut ter&rsquo;s Three-Fig ure Au thor Ta ble, Cut ter-Sanborn Three-
Fig ure Au thor Ta ble, and a sim ple Cut ter&rsquo;s Two-Fig ure Au thor Ta ble.
Because of the growth in library col lections, which cre ated a need for an
extended Cut ter num ber, in 1996, OCLC pub lished the Four-Fig ure Cut-
ter Ta bles, based on the ex isting three-fig ure schemes. See Fig ure 6.4 for a
sam ple page re pro duced from C. A. Cut ter&rsquo;s Three-Fig ure Au thor Ta -

Ta bles, which can be found in OCLC Spe cial Re port at &lt;oclc.org/oclc/
re search/pub li ca tions/review96/cut ter.htm&gt;.
</p>
<p>For ex ample, the call num ber for the book Per sonal Power by Arleen
Labella is 650.14.L112. The Dewey num ber for this book is 650.14, in -
dicating the sub ject of the book. To be more ex act, 650 is for the sub ject
Man age ment and aux il iary ser vices, and .14 is one of the sub divisions
for 650 in dicating the more spe cific topic Success in ob taining jobs and
pro mo tion. The au thor num ber .L112 gives this book an exact lo cation
on the shelves, be tween a book on the same topic by Lab (.L111) and an -
other book on the same topic by Labi (.L113).
</p>
<p>More il lustrations on how to de cide on the author num ber are de -
scribed here. For au thor Sam uel Baker, the au thor num ber is .B177.
Margaret Armstrong&rsquo;s au thor num ber is .Ar58. For Ed ward Smith, the
author num ber is .Sm55. When the author&rsquo;s name falls be tween two
numbers, the first one is used. For ex ample, for au thor Tidd, .T438 is
the ap propriate au thor num ber. For au thor Range, .R163 is the right
choice. The num ber next to the au thor&rsquo;s name is cho sen ac cording to
instructions printed in the Cut ter book, such as us ing the first two let -
ters of an au thor&rsquo;s name if the first let ter is a vowel.
</p>
<p>Occasionally two or more call numbers will be the same, mak ing it
difficult to de cide on their ab solute lo cation on the shelves. In this case,

<p>Some li braries do not use the Cut ter ta bles to fig ure out the au thor

<p>LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
</p>
<p>The Li brary of Con gress Clas sification sys tem is the sec ond most
widely used sys tem in the United States, used by most ac ademic li-
braries and special li braries. Many of these li braries used the Dewey
system orig inally but changed to the Library of Con gress sys tem in
the late 1960s and early 1970s.
</p>
<p>Classification 91</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Li brary of Con gress Clas si fi ca tion (LCC) sys tem di vides knowl-
edge into twenty-one broad cat egories, us ing a let ter to rep resent each 
subject field. The letters I, O, W, X, and Y are ex cluded. See Fig ure
6.6 for the out line of the schedules.
</p>
<p>The Li brary of Con gress Clas sification sys tem is used much the
same way as the Dewey system, ex cept that let ters are substituted for
numbers to de note the par ticular sub ject field. To pro vide for ex pan-
sion, dou ble or tri ple let ters, when nec essary, are used for sub classes.
The let ter no tation along with a numerical value completes the LC
clas si fi ca tion num ber. On some oc ca sions, an other let ter-num ber com-
bination is nec essary to de scribe pre cisely the sub ject mat ter. For ex-
ample, the LC classification num ber for the book Training for Non-
Trainers is HF5549.5.T7. The fol lowing break down shows what each
part or num ber rep resents:
</p>
<p>H Social science
HF Commerce
HF5549 Personnel management
HF5549.5 Employment management. By topic, A-Z
HF5549.5.T7 Training of employee
</p>
<p>Note that .T7 is part of the classification number, not an
author number or book number.
</p>
<p>Each of the LC class sched ules is pub lished sep arately in pamphlet
for mat. The in di vid ual sub ject schemes are in de pend ently cre ated by
subject spe cialists in each field and there fore do not fall into a con sis-
tent pat tern. Since this sys tem was de vised orig inally by the Library
of Con gress to or ganize its own col lection, some sched ules are more
detailed than oth ers. When needed, each sched ule can be ex panded
easily by add ing num bers, dec imals, and letters to the main class,
and, in fact, this is done reg ularly by the Library of Con gress. Each
schedule has a dif ferent pub lication date, and the new re visions are
printed at dif fer ent in ter vals.
</p>
<p>Each sched ule in cludes a syn opsis first, then the sched ule, and fi -

also pub lishes Sub ject Cat a loging Man ual: Clas si fi ca tion as a prac ti-

discussed in Chap ter 5, in clude: classifying a work by its spe cific
subject, us ing the most spe cific num ber avail able; as signing num bers
according to in structions printed in the sched ules; and classifying a
work with a broader sub ject if the work deals with sev eral sub jects.
</p>
<p>The LC sched ules are kept up to date through the quar terly pub li-

A CD-ROM for mat of the LC clas sification, called Clas si fi ca tion
Plus, produced by the Library of Con gress, is also avail able. This is
convenient and ef ficient be cause it allows a search by key words,
clas si fi ca tion num bers, prox im ity op tions, Boolean op er a tions, etc.
However, all sched ules are not yet au tomated, so the latest CD-ROM
version con tains only twenty-seven sched ules out of forty-six. Ad di-

the year. Another avail able elec tronic for mat is the Super LCCS CD,
produced by Gale Re search Com pany.
</p>
<p>BOOK NUMBER FOR THE LCCS
</p>
<p>The pur pose of cuttering is to cre ate a unique call num ber by com -
posing a log ical and or derly subarrangement within a class. The main 
element of the LC call num ber consists of one to three cap ital let ters
followed by a one- to four-digit num ber with up to three dec imal
places, for ex ample, HF5549.5. A top ical Cut ter num ber is added to
the clas si fi ca tion num ber if an ex traor di narily pre cise iden ti fi ca tion
is re quired, for ex ample, HF5549.5.T7. The .T7 stands for train ing in
this ex ample; it is not the au thor number.
</p>
<p>The Li brary of Con gress has de vised its own method of as signing
the book num ber, also called au thor num ber or Cut ter num ber. It
resembles the Cutter num ber from the Cut ter-Sanborn ta ble, but is
less com plicated be cause all the de tails are in cluded and coded by the
LC clas si fi ca tion num ber it self, as de scribed pre vi ously. Fig ure 6.7
shows the cut ter num bers de vised by the Li brary of Con gress.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Classification 95
</p>
<p>As a gen eral prac tice, the Li brary of Con gress has added the pub li-
cation date to the clas sification num ber and the au thor num ber. For
example, a com plete call num ber may look like this: Z693.W94
1991. Z693 is the LC classification num ber, rep resenting the sub ject
cat a log ing, .94 is the au thor num ber for Wynar, and 1991 is the pub -
lication date. In the MARC for mat, the LC call number is found in the 
field with tag num ber 050. For a lo cally as signed LC call num ber,
090 is the proper field.
</p>
<p>When as sign ing clas si fi ca tion num bers and Cut ter num bers, the li-
brary tech nician must take time to read the in structions carefully and
follow the di rections pre cisely. It is both in teresting and chal lenging.
With prac tice and ex perience, the job of classifying ma terial will fall
into its log ical se quence.

<p>Chapter 7
</p>
<p>Copy Cataloging
</p>
<p>Now that we have learned about de scriptive cataloging, sub ject
cat a log ing, and clas si fi ca tion sys tems, the pro cess of cat a log ing is
complete. Cataloging makes it pos sible for the us ers to de termine, by
checking un der au thor, ti tle, or sub ject, if the needed ma terials are
contained in a par ticular col lection.  The call num ber on the card or
displayed on the computer screen serves as a lo cation guide, making
it con venient for the user to go to a spe cific shelf to get the material.
What we see on the card or screen is the re sult of the process of cat alog-
ing, called a bib liographic re cord, in li brary terms.  When cataloging is
done step-by-step in-house, as ex plained in the pre vious chap ters, it is
called orig i nal cat a log ing, and it is nec es sary for li brary tech ni cians
working in the cataloging de partment to have the knowl edge re quired
for orig i nal cat a log ing. How ever, the ma jor ity of new ac qui si tions
have al ready been cat aloged by some other cat aloger at the Li brary of 
Congress or, per haps, at an other li brary, and there is no need to spend
the time and ef fort to &ldquo;re invent the wheel.&rdquo;  If such is the case, we
adopt the cataloging al ready done by some one else for our own lo cal
use, by re cording it with out change, or by making mi nor changes or
modifications to suit the lo cal sit uation.  The pro cess of tak ing al -
ready es tab lished cat a log ing in for ma tion and ap ply ing it for lo cal use
is called copy cat a log ing, that is, pre paring a bib liographic re cord of
our own by us ing or adapt ing the bib liographic re cord pre pared by a
cat a loger from an other li brary or or ga ni za tion. Copy cat a log ing is a
widespread prac tice in the li brary world. It saves per sonnel, time, and 
money, re sulting in speed ier ser vice while maintaining high qual ity.
Copy cat a log ing should be per formed when ever pos si ble.

<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>bib lio graphic util ity: A con sortium, or a net work of auto mated
libraries sharing one or more machine readable databases. Bib -
liographic util ities may be large or small, and they may be
national, inter national, or regional in scope.
</p>
<p>CIP: Abbre vi a tion for Cat a loging in Pub li ca tion. In this prac tice, the
cataloging infor mation pre pared by the Library of Con gress before
the book is pub lished is incor porated into the book and printed on the
copyright page (the back of the title page). 
</p>
<p>MARC: Refers to Machine Read able Cat aloging. MARC tapes are
computer tapes with bibliographic records, done in MARC for mat,
compiled by the Library of Con gress. MARC tapes are used for copy
cataloging either through direct access to the tapes or by par ticipating
in a net work that uses MARC tapes as a main source for its data base.
</p>
<p>net work: A group of auto mated libraries that join together for the
purpose of shar ing infor mation by using the same library application
system from a centralized com puter facility.
</p>
<p>OCLC: Abbre viation for Online Computer Library Center. This is the
world&rsquo;s larg est and most com pre hen sive bib lio graphic util ity, con sist -
ing of over 30,000 mem bers through out the world, and cur rently with a 
database of mil lions of records that is grow ing every day.
</p>
<p>union list: A com bined list of the hold ings of many librar ies. It may
be on paper or, more likely, in electronic for mat, usu ally referred to
as the online union list.
</p>
<p>To per form copy cat aloging, one must be able to find the record
created by some one else. One way to do that is through the CIP in for-
mation. An other is buy ing the re cords from com mercial library ser -
vice com panies. In nei ther case is there a con tribution to the da tabase,
which does oc cur, how ever, when copy cat aloging is done by shared
cat a log ing or co op er a tive cat a log ing, with the use of a bib lio graphic
util ity. The da ta bases in bib lio graphic util i ties usu ally in clude the
MARC da tabase from the Library of Con gress plus the cat aloging re -
</p>
<p>98 Cataloging and Classification for Library Technicians</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>cords cre ated by par tic i pat ing li brar ies. For au to mated li brar ies that
are part of a con sortium, copy cataloging can be done by re trieving
the re cord from the da tabase, and, si multaneously, if the re cord is not
in ex istence, cre ating a new re cord in the MARC for mat and add ing it 
to the da tabase.
</p>
<p>Copy cat aloging is done at different lev els. One level is true copy
cataloging, that is, du plicating a re cord so that it is an ex act copy of
the orig inal work. The sec ond level of copy cataloging is to use an -
other li brary&rsquo;s re cord as a base and edit or mod ify the re cord to meet
local needs. If the description of the re cord is an ex act match, and if
the orig inator is a rep utable source such as the Library of Con gress,
usually the record is cop ied with out any changes. On the other hand,
if it is a so-called near match, or close copy, meaning that some in for-
mation, per haps the edi tion or the imprint, does not match what is
found, then a de cision has to be made. In some cases, a lit tle ed iting or 
mod i fy ing will do. Ac cord ing to the OCLC stan dard fol lowed by au -
tomated libraries, a new re cord must be cre ated if the word ing in the
title is dif ferent; if it is a dif ferent edi tion; if the publication place or
the pub lisher is dif ferent; if the publication date is dif ferent; if paging
is dif ferent; and if the size has a dif ference of more than two cen time-
ters. Care ful judg ment dif fer en ti ates be tween a new re cord be ing cre-
ated ver sus an old re cord be ing du plicated. In serting re cords al ready
there re sults in a dirty database. The li brary tech nician must be very
familiar with a li brary&rsquo;s policies and must ad here to such pol icies
when per forming the task of copy cataloging.
</p>
<p>SOURCES FOR COPY CATALOGING
</p>
<p>The Library of Congress
</p>
<p>The most ex tensive and com monly used sources for copy cat alog-
ing come from the Li brary of Con gress in book form, on com puter
disk, or in CD-ROM for mat. The Cataloging Dis tribution Ser vice
(CDS) Di vision of the Li brary of Con gress has the fol lowing pub lica-
tions, which are all sources for copy cat aloging. For more in formation
and costs, check the CDS Web page &lt;lcweb.loc.gov/cds/un ion.html&gt;.

<p>In mi crofiche for mat, there are Na tional Un ion Cat a log on Mi cro -
fiche and The Mu sic Cat alog on Mi crofiche. In print for mat, there are
Na tional Un ion Cat a log: Books, Na tional Un ion Cat a log: Au dio-
vi sual Ma te rials, and Na tional Un ion Cat a log: Car to graphic Ma te -
rials. All these pub li ca tions cover bib lio graphic re cords of ma te ri als
cataloged by the Library of Con gress from 1983 to the most cur rent
year. Ref erences for earlier ma terials have the same ti tle but with a
different date as part of the ti tle.
</p>
<p>Figure 7.1 is a page re produced from the Na tional Un ion Cat a log.
For ex ample, the book Through Rus sian Eyes by Gromyko can be found 
on this page. From the Li brary of Con gress en try, you can copy not
only in for ma tion for de scrip tive cat a log ing but also the sub ject head-
ing and clas sification num ber as well. No tice that both the LC num ber
and the Dewey num ber are printed as part of the bib liographic re cord
for the con venience of libraries us ing ei ther sys tem. The Library of
Congress, which needs the LC num ber for it self only, adds the Dewey
Decimal num bers to ap proximately two-thirds of the books as a ser vice
to the library com munity, help ing to re duce the ef fort and cost for cat a-
loging in Dewey li braries.
</p>
<p>For Dewey li braries, the num ber af ter the dec imal point is sep arated
by an apos trophe mark ( ' ), called a prime mark. This is done to meet the 
needs of li braries of var ious sizes. For ex ample, Dewey num ber
973.922' 092'4 is listed for the book by Gromyko in Fig ure 7.1. This
means that a small library with few books on this topic may use 973.922
as the clas sification num ber, while 973.922092 may be a more suit able
number for a larger library hav ing a larger collection on this topic. For an 
even larger library, or a li brary that has a large col lection of his torical
materials, an even more spe cific num ber 973.9220924 may be the best
choice. Note that the au thor num ber is not listed and there fore needs to
be as signed by the lo cal cataloger, ei ther ac cording to the rules of the
Cutter ta ble or any other local sys tem the library may use. This Dewey
number is used as a whole on the catalog card or on the computer da ta-
base without the prime marks.
</p>
<p>Automated libraries can sub scribe to the Library of Con gress cat a-
loging re cords on MARC (ma chine read able cataloging) tapes. More
often, li braries will share MARC tapes with other li braries through a
consortium ar rangement. When us ing the MARC da tabase as a copy
cataloging source, the copy cataloger matches the ma terial on hand to

<p>the same ti tle al ready in the da tabase, cat aloged by the Li brary of
Congress. The lo cal li brary code or sym bol is then en tered and the
cat a log ing is done.
</p>
<p>In 1996, the Li brary of Con gress started a co operative ar rangement
called Pro gram for Co op er a tive Cat a loging. Cur rently, the mem ber -
ship, made up of mostly li braries with large collections, to tals 340.
Membership con tributes not only to the orig inal MARC re cords for
monographs (books) and se rials; but also to name au thorities, sub ject
au thor i ties, and clas si fi ca tion pro pos als. As a re sult, the bib lio graphic
records from the MARC tapes that are dis played on the screen may not
have orig inated from the Li brary of Con gress, but from a par ticipating
in sti tu tion. Li braries uni ver sally ben e fit from this vast da ta base of
high-qual ity cat a log ing.
</p>
<p>Cataloging in Publication (CIP)
</p>
<p>In most books pub lished in the United States, cataloging in forma-
tion can be found on the copy right page, which is the back of the title
page. This is called Cataloging in Pub lication, a pro ject started by the Li -
brary of Con gress in 1971. Over one mil lion CIP re cords have been pro -
cessed, and 4,500 Amer i can pub lish ers cur rently par tic i pate in this
program. Un der the agree ment, be fore a book is pub lished, the pub lisher
sends the gal ley proofs, or gal ley sur rogates, such as ti tle page, copyright
page, se ries page, ta ble of con tents, and sam ple chap ters to in dicate sub -
ject cov erage, to the Library of Con gress. The Li brary of Con gress cat a-
logs the ma terial within ten days and sends the cataloging in formation
back to the pub lisher so that the bib liographic re cord can be in cluded and 
printed on the copyright page of the book when the book is pub lished.
This pro ject ben e fits the li brar ies enor mously be cause the in for ma tion
comes si multaneously with the book, and no fur ther search ing for cat a-
log ing in for ma tion is nec es sary. Uti lized prop erly, CIP is the best
source for copy cat aloging.
</p>
<p>Because the cataloging is done be fore the book is pub lished, in for-
mation on the full de scription of the book, such as pag ing and other
physical de scription, can not be in cluded. Also, when the book is pub -
lished on a later date, the ti tle, subtitle, and the date of publication
may be changed. The copy cat aloger must be very careful in check ing
</p>
<p>Copy Cataloging 103</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>all the el e ments when ex am in ing and tran scrib ing the CIP in for ma -
tion and make the nec essary changes.
</p>
<p>When a book with CIP in formation is pub lished, the Library of
Congress will up grade the CIP in for ma tion to the full cat a log ing
level and replace the old, in complete, temporary re cord with the new
one. The LC staff com pares the pre pub li ca tion cat a log ing re cord with
the bib liographic el ements in the pub lished book and makes nec es-
sary changes to en sure that the re vised re cord ac curately de scribes
the pub lication and all the phys ical de scription el ements added to the
new re cord. All the CIP re cords and the sub sequent ver ified re cords
are en tered as part of the MARC record da tabase.
</p>
<p>Recently, the Li brary of Con gress in stituted a pro gram in which
pub lish ers can trans mit the needed in for ma tion elec tron i cally to the
Library of Con gress, and vice versa. Named ECIP, for elec tronic cat -
a log ing in pub li ca tion, the pro ject pro motes ef fi ciency and re duces
pa per work, with li brar ies as the main ben e fi cia ries.
</p>
<p>To ac cel er ate the up grad ing of CIP re cords, the OCLC (On line
Computer Li brary Cen ter) has established an of fice at the Ac ademic
Book Cen ter, staffed with OCLC cat a log ers. Re cently, the OCLC has
accepted the up graded CIP re cords of the Yan kee Ped dler, a book
dealer, as well. Up grading re cords &ldquo;on-site&rdquo; at the book ven dors has
added an other el ement of ef ficiency to the pro cess and has re sulted in
wide spread use.
</p>
<p>Figure 7.2 is an ex ample of CIP in for ma tion re pro duced from the
copyright page of a book&mdash;the first edi tion of this textbook, Cat a -
loging and Clas si fi ca tion for Li brary Tech ni cians. From the ex am-
ple, we can see that in formation on many elements needs to be added.
Still, you will find the main and added en tries, the sub ject headings,
and the ap plicable clas sification num ber, all of which will speed your 
cat a log ing pro cess.
</p>
<p>Commercial Sources
</p>
<p>If re quested, com mercial book ven dors such as Bro-Dart and
Baker &amp; Taylor provide card sets at a min imum fee for all the ma teri-
als or dered from them. The sets are complete with cataloging in forma-
tion and come with the books or other type of me dia. Also, such li brary

<p>Many in ternational, na tional, and regional net works ex ist. The in -
formation from all of them can be used for copy cat aloging. Some
net works also of fer ad di tional cat a log ing ser vices to mem ber li brar -
ies. OCLC is the most uti lized.
</p>
<p>With a membership of over 30,000 li braries in sixty-five countries,
OCLC is the old est and the largest li brary net work. The OCLC da ta-
base con sists of MARC tapes that in clude all the cat aloging done by
the Li brary of Con gress, plus cat a log ing con trib uted by the af fil i ate
li brar ies. Li braries join OCLC through a re gional bro ker net work,
such as NELINET (New Eng land Li brary In for ma tion Net work) in
Boston for New Eng land li braries.
</p>
<p>OCLC and its shared form of cataloging have trans formed cat alog-
ing prac tices across the United States. The cat aloger uses OCLC&rsquo;s On -
line Un ion Cat a log to lo cate cat a log ing in for ma tion. With a da ta base
of mil lions of bib liographic re cords, it is es timated that over 80 per cent
of any li brary&rsquo;s cat aloging needs can be filled, thus greatly re ducing
the time-con sum ing task of orig i nal cat a log ing. Since copy cat a log -
ing has be come so com mon, tra di tional orig i nal cat a log ing is used
only for the unique or un usual ma terials that cannot be found in the
database. This change in em phasis has placed the li brary tech nician
into the cataloging pro fession, which pre viously had been the librar-
ian&rsquo;s do main.
</p>
<p>In ad dition to its On line Un ion Cat a log (OLUC) that is used
throughout the world, OCLC of fers some other cat aloging ser vices.
One is the Bib lio graphic Re cord No ti fi ca tion ser vice. This ser vice
au to mat i cally de liv ers on line up graded MARC re cords and ad di -
tional fea tures. OCLC&rsquo;s PromptCat ser vice starts when the ma terials
are be ing or dered. The ven dor no tifies OCLC of the ti tles or dered by
the li brary, and OCLC finds the matching re cord in its On line Un ion
Catalog, sets the library&rsquo;s hold ing sym bol, and sends a copy of the
MARC re cord to the library to load into the lo cal sys tem. In ad dition,
it will send to the ven dor elec tronic files of la bels for phys ical pro -
cessing. By the time the ma terials are re ceived, the re cords al ready
have been loaded and the ma terials are ready to be shelved. OCLC&rsquo;s
TECHPRO ser vice pro vides off-site con tract cat a log ing and phys i cal 
processing to meet a li brary&rsquo;s spec ifications. It is a customized cat a-
loging ser vice by con tract, such as cataloging of for eign lan guage
ma te ri als. TECHPRO can be used to cat alog spe cial types of ma teri-

<p>als, such as Chi nese-language books, or to clear up a back log. The
CatCD for Win dows soft ware of fers Win dows-based CD-ROM cat a-
loging in an offline, stand-alone en vironment and gives the sub scrib-
ing li brary ac cess to a sub set, CD-ROM only, of the OCLC On line

vice, which helps a li brary to con vert all of its re cords to full MARC

log ing for cus tom ers. OCLC dis continues services from time to time
and adds new ser vices, de pending on the de veloping li brary trends

<p>Figure 7.3 shows a MARC re cord as re trieved from the OCLC da -
tabase. From this re cord, one can copy the call num ber, the sub ject
headings, and other per tinent in formation from field 050, field 650,
and so on. If copy cat aloging on line, for a to tal match, en tering your
library&rsquo;s code is the only re quirement. The code DLC in field 040
means that the source of this re cord is the Li brary of Con gress. The
LC clas si fi ca tion num ber des ig nated by the Li brary of Con gress is
put in the 050 field.
</p>
<p>Figure 7.4 is an OCLC re cord con tributed by a member li brary. It
contains in formation such as call num ber, sub ject headings, added
entry, and the de scription of the material so that the li brary tech nician
can per form copy cat aloging quickly and easily. In this ex ample, the
MIA, MIA, and OCL in the 040 field show that this re cord is not
inputted by the Li brary of Con gress (DLC), but by a mem ber li brary
whose sym bol is MIA (Mi ami Uni versity, Ox ford, Ohio). The LC
classification that is as signed lo cally is put in the 090 field. More de -
tails about fields in the MARC re cord are dis cussed in Chap ter 8. 
</p>
<p>Other large na tional net works that are used the same way as de -
scribed in the OCLC sec tion are RLIN and A-G Canada. Lo cal and
regional net works are also avail able as sources for copy cat aloging,
although their da tabases usu ally are not as large.

<p>As cat aloging has evolved into a li brary tech nician&rsquo;s area of re sponsi-
bility, ed ucation and training for that po sition has be come more exten-

sources are es sen tial. If copy cat a log ing in for ma tion can not be lo cated, 
the li brary tech nician may have to per form orig inal cat aloging.  In that
case, it is necessary to ap ply the pro cedures in volved with de scriptive
cat a log ing, sub ject cat a log ing, and clas si fi ca tion, as dis cussed in Chap-

<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>delim iter: The char acter, or symbol, used to pre cede each subfield in
the MARC for mat. Depending on the soft ware, dif ferent sym bols are
used, but the most common are $, &ne;, and _ .
</p>
<p>field: On the MARC for mat, the bibliographic infor mation of each
record is sep arated into different parts, such as author, title, pub lisher,
etc., form ing fields in which each dif ferent part has a separate line
with a num ber attached to the line. Field cor responds to the term
area, as described in AACR2R.
</p>
<p>indi ca tor:  A one-digit numeric code that fol lows the tag and pre -
cedes the field. For some fields, two num bers are used, one giv ing
instruction to the com puter for pro cessing infor mation, and the other
providing infor mation about the con tent of the field. The two are
inde pend ent num bers.
</p>
<p>leader: The leader is the first twenty-four char acters of the MARC
record. Infor mation con tained in the leader includes record sta tus,
type of record, bib liographic level, and oth ers. These are all fixed
fields, and the information is for com puter use only.
</p>
<p>MARC: MARC stands for machine read able cataloging. It con sists
of a sys tem of inputting the cataloging infor mation on the computer
following a stan dard devised by the Library of Con gress. This stan -
dardized for mat allows other librar ies to share the data, the computer
to inter pret the data, and users to retrieve the data. MARC has been
</p>
<p>111</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>adopted by bib lio graphic util i ties and indi vid ual librar ies that cat a log 
on com put ers.
</p>
<p>MARC 21: A con tin u a tion of USMARC and CAN/MARC (MARC
standards used by Cana dian librar ies) that is a harmonized for mat of
the two, with differences between the two formats elim inated.
</p>
<p>PREMARC: The 4.2 million older records (pre-1968) filmed from
the Library of Con gress shelflist and con verted to the MARC for mat
by Carrolton Press. Also called REMARC.
</p>
<p>subfield: Each field in the MARC record contains sev eral related
pieces of data, and each piece of data is called a subfield. Each
subfield is pre ceded by a delimiter, such as $ or &ne; , and by a subfield
code, such as a or b.
</p>
<p>tag: A string of three-digit num bers indi cating the dif ferent fields,
such as 100 for author, 245 for title.
</p>
<p>USMARC: The MARC records cre ated, used, and dis tributed by the
Library of Con gress. Libraries in the United States follow its spec ified
standards. Ori ginally called LC MARC in the 1960s, and USMARC
until 1999, MARC 21 is the revised identification.
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>Now in the twenty-first century, most li braries ei ther have con verted
or are con verting to com puter cat aloging. The card catalog is no lon ger
a com mon sight. As a li brary tech nician whose job in volves cat alog-
ing, chances are that you will be work ing at a computer ter minal. Your
work will con sist of copy cat aloging mostly, but occasionally you will
have to do some orig inal cat aloging. When per forming copy cat alog-
ing, you will pull up re cords from the da tabase that match the materials
you are cat aloging and sim ply add your li brary&rsquo;s sym bol to them. With
original cat aloging, how ever, you will pull up a blank MARC work
form on the com puter and in put data into each field, ac cording to the
specified rules ex plained in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Be cause the in for-
mation to be re corded via the com puter is the same as that which
would be typed onto a catalog card, and be cause the method of ex -

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>tracting in formation from the item re mains the same, the rules ap -
plied will follow AACR2R for de scrip tive cat a log ing, Sears or
LCSH for sub ject heading, and LCC or DDC for clas si fi ca tion num-
ber. As in the card en vironment, where pieces of in formation are ar -
ranged on the card, in the com puter en vironment, the necessary
information re quires its proper place. The Li brary of Con gress
MARC for mat pro vides the struc ture that is fol lowed.
</p>
<p>THE MARC FORMAT
</p>
<p>All au tomated libraries fol low the MARC for mat. Fig ure 8.1 dem -
onstrates how a MARC re cord is or ganized, by fields with tag num bers
attached. This chart will pro vide you with some gen eral knowl edge of
what a MARC re cord in cludes and how it compares to the in forma-
tion placed on the cat alog card.
</p>
<p>Within each hun dred group, much in formation can be expressed
by the &ldquo;XX&rdquo;. For ex ample, within the 1XX field for main en try, there
may be a 100 field for per sonal au thor, a 110 field for cor porate name,
or 111 field for con ference as main en try. In the 2XX field, there may
be 240 for uni form ti tle, 245 for ti tle and statement of re sponsibility,
250 for edi tion statement, and 260 for imprint state ment. These three-
digit tag num bers tell the com puter what kind of in formation is to fol -
low.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In Chap ter 4, you learned about ar eas and el ements that need to be
recorded on the cat alog card. With the MARC format, the el ements
within the ar eas, the main and added en tries, plus sub ject headings
and other rel evant in formation are all pre sented in separate lines in
logical or der.  Each line starts with a three-digit num ber called a tag,
followed by two sin gle (sep arated) num bers, called in di ca tors, and
then the de scriptive phrases, called fields, and fi nally subfields,
which give a more de tailed explanation of the fields.  Each subfield is
preceded by a subfield code, which con sists of a de limiter and a low-
ercase let ter. A more de tailed ex planation with ex amples is dem on-
strated in Fig ure 8.2.
</p>
<p>These are the most com monly used fields, with the pre ceding tag
numbers that a cataloger needs. For ex ample, tag 245 tells the com-
puter that ti tle and statement of responsibility will follow, and the two
indicators ( _  _ ) con tain important in formation about the item. The
first in di ca tor 0 would mean no ti tle added entry is needed, while 1
would mean ti tle added entry is needed. The sec ond in dicator tells the 
computer how many nonfiling char acters there are, ranging from 0 to
9. For ex ample, if a ti tle starts with ar ticle the, the sec ond in di ca tor
will be 4, which in structs the com puter to skip four spaces (t, h, e, and
space) when fil ing this ti tle. A few more com monly used in dicators
are listed in Fig ure 8.3.
</p>
<p>Figure 8.3, which is adapted from the MARC for mat pub lished by
the Li brary of Con gress, dem onstrates how in dicators are as signed to
lead to a more re fined de scription. When cataloging on line, you
should con sult the OCLC man ual or the manual used by your bib lio-
graphic utility, which pro vides all MARC fields.
</p>
<p>Recalling Figure 8.2, af ter the in dicators come the fields, which in -
clude au thor, ti tle, or sub ject ar eas. A sam ple of fields and subfields
are listed in Fig ure 8.4 to dem onstrate how they are or ganized.
</p>
<p>Every field has nu merous subfields. A guide to the MARC for mat,
either pub lished by the Library of Con gress or by your bib liographic
utility such as OCLC, should be kept handy when cataloging on line
Pub li ca tions such as MARC For mat Ref er ence Card: Books and
MARC For mat Ref er ence Card: Se ri als are ex cel lent re sources. Very
rarely will you need most of the tags men tioned here. Ac cording to
the Li brary of Con gress, only 10 per cent of the tags are used fre -
quently, the other 90 per cent are used only occasionally.

lines called the lead ers in the fixed fields, up to the 008 field. These
fixed fields, or the con trolled variable fields, con tain re cord data such
as re cord sta tus, type, the date the re cord was en tered, the language,
bibliographic level, etc., all sup plied by the MARC sys tem. For ex am-
ple, in Fig ure 8.8 the top part be fore the 040 field is the leader. You
may have to change or add some data when they are dif ferent from
the de fault set by the sys tem, such as coun try code or lan guage code.

quires a full knowl edge of on line cataloging, mak ing it nec essary to
understand thor oughly the MARC for mat. These numbers and codes
are not to be memorized, but knowl edge of how to ap ply them is most 
important. When cataloging on line, you will have a hand book to
guide you. The Library of Con gress pub lished sev eral cataloging aids
that serve as references for the MARC format. They are for sale by the

<p>ORIGINAL AND COPY CATALOGING ON COMPUTERS
</p>
<p>When cat aloging on line, it is nec essary to use your li brary&rsquo;s com -
puter da tabase to pull up the bib liographic re cord that matches the
item you are cat aloging. This can be accomplished in sev eral dif fer-
ent ways. With many ac cess points to use, correct data are readily
available. In most sys tems, a good start is the ISBN num ber, the
LCCN num ber, the au thor, the title, and some other com binations of
two or more el ements. Also, in most sys tems, you may qualify the
search, such as lim iting it to ma terial type, such as video record ing, or
by date, so that you do not need to browse in efficiently through a lot
of ti tles to find your item. In the OCLC sys tem, you may also search
using a va riety of spe cial methods. One ex ample is the 4, 3, 1 rule,
whereby a user can en ter the first four letters of the au thor&rsquo;s last
name, add a comma, then the first three letters of the au thor&rsquo;s first
name, a comma, and the first let ter of the au thor&rsquo;s mid dle name. An -
other way to search is by ti tle, us ing the first three let ters of the first
</p>
<p>122 Cataloging and Classification for Library Technicians</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>word, a comma, and then the first two let ters of the ti tle&rsquo;s second
word, a comma, and then the first two let ters of the ti tle&rsquo;s third word,
a comma, and fi nally the first let ter of the fourth word in the ti tle. This 
is re ferred to as the 3, 2, 2, 1 rule. OCLC searches em ploy other com -
binations and other sys tems use dif ferent search techniques. Most im -
portant are un derstanding the ba sics of the MARC for mat, re ferring
to the hand book or man ual of the sys tem your library uses, and learn -
ing the de tailed rules and pro cedures needed to re trieve the re cords.
</p>
<p>Let us sup pose that you find a record that matches ex actly the item
you are seek ing to cat alog. At this point, add your li brary&rsquo;s hold ing
symbol to it and the cat aloging pro cess is done. Your sys tem man ual
will tell you how to en ter the sym bol, which in many sys tems au to-
matically is displayed on the screen, then press the send key to com -
plete the copy cat aloging pro cess. If the re cord dif fers only slightly
from your item, such as hav ing a dif ferent pub lisher, a dif ferent edi -
tion, or is in any other way dif ferent even though the au thor and ti tle
are the same, it is not con sidered a match. The in formation on the
screen, how ever, can be used to build a new en try for the item you
have. Some times you will need to add, de lete, or mod ify data to suit
your lo cal needs. 
</p>
<p>If the re cord for your item is not found, orig inal cat aloging is re -
quired. In such a case, you will pull up the work  form and fill in all the 
necessary in formation, care fully matching all your data to the fields
and subfields of the MARC for mat. At this time not only is your
knowledge of the MARC for mat es sential, as discussed in this chap -
ter, but you will also need the skills you learned from the pre vious
chap ters for as sign ing sub ject head ings, clas si fi ca tion num bers, and
the rules for de scribing the item phys ically. Only af ter you have en -
tered all the data can the re cord be called com plete.  Finally, your li -
brary&rsquo;s sym bol is added to the re cord as in copy cat aloging.
</p>
<p>In sum mary, no mat ter what au tomated sys tem your library uses, it 
is a ver sion of the MARC for mat. As long as you have a thorough un -
derstanding of the MARC for mat, you can catalog on your sys tem by
following the pro cedures out lined in the user&rsquo;s man ual for the sys -
tem.

</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>author ity file: Files of autho rized names, series titles, or sub ject
headings used in a cat alog. The file is checked when doing cataloging
to ensure con sistency in the form of names, series titles, and sub ject
headings. The card catalog or the OPAC data base is usu ally the
author ity file.
</p>
<p>pro cess ing: The task of phys ically pre paring the materials for the
shelves. Pro cedures involved dif fer from library to library, depend -
ing on deci sions made locally. Tasks include attaching the spine
labels to materials, typing cards, attaching bar codes to mate rials,
attaching date-due slips to mate rials, and stamp ing mate rials with the
prop erty stamp.
</p>
<p>shelflist: A file, either in card or book for mat or in the com puter data -
base, arranged in order by call num bers, show ing the library&rsquo;s hold ings
in shelf order. The shelflist is used usu ally by library staff only for staff
functions such as col lection devel opment or inven tory con trol.
</p>
<p>ORGANIZATION
</p>
<p>From li brary to li brary, the or ga ni za tion of the cat a log ing de part -
ment var ies. Al ways in cluded, how ever, are the cataloging and clas -
sification plus the pro cessing of all materials. In other words, the
preparation of ma terials for shelves can be broadly di vided into two
groups: cat aloging first, pro cessing sec ond. So far we have dis cussed
</p>
<p>125</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>cat a log ing com pletely, both orig i nal and copy cat a log ing. The next
step is the processing of the cat aloged ma terials.
</p>
<p>THE AUTHORITY FILE
</p>
<p>The pur pose of cat aloging and hav ing a cat alog is so that us ers can
have easy ac cess to a well-organized col lection. The op timum use of
a cat alog de pends on au thentic en tries and a clean da tabase. This re-
quires that the name of a per son or or ganization that serves as an ac -
cess point ap pears in the same form, so that all the ma terials authored
by the same per son or cor porate body oc cur to gether on the screen or
are filed together in the same section of the cat alog. Establishing a list 
of all the authoritative ac cess points is called au thor ity con trol. Ac -
cess points that need to have au thority con trol in clude name, se ries ti -
tles, and sub ject.
</p>
<p>The guide lines to use for as signing au thority re cords are in a Li -
brary of Con gress pub li ca tion ti tled USMARC For mat for Au thority
Data. In this publication is the for mat of stan dard forms for names of
per sons and or ga ni za tions, se ries ti tles, uni form ti tles, and sub ject
terms used in bib liographic re cords. The cho sen forms as the au thori-
tative names were selected by the Li brary of Congress and the Name
Au thor ity Co op er a tive (NACO), which is com posed of li brary rep re-
sentatives who also con tribute to the authoritative name lists. The Li -
brary of Con gress books da tabase serves as the name authority file,
and the Library of Con gress Sub ject Head ings is the subject au thority
file that cat alogers should use. For on line cataloging in the MARC
format, fields 1XX, 7XX, and 4XX need to be checked against the
authority files to en sure proper us age.
</p>
<p>Since au thor ity con trol is a time-con sum ing, la bor-in ten sive task,
many li braries, es pecially the au tomated ones, con tract this work out
to au thority ser vice ven dors. The au thority ser vice ven dor checks and 
revises all the new head ings in the bib liographic re cords and pro vides
new au thority re cords for the li braries as well. In this case, ac cess
points no lon ger need to be checked in dividually and rou tinely by the
in-house cat alogers, and as a re sult, cat aloging can be done more
quickly.
</p>
<p>126 Cataloging and Classification for Library Technicians</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CATALOGING ROUTINES
</p>
<p>After the ma terials are re ceived and properly checked in, they are
sent to the cataloging de partment, where the first step of cat aloging
be gins. The li brary tech ni cian first searches for cat a log ing in for ma -
tion from the iden tified print sources or matches the ti tles with the ex -
isting ti tles in the da tabase. If in formation for copy cataloging is not
avail able, then the li brary tech ni cian will per form orig i nal cat a log -
ing, the de tails of which were discussed in Chap ters 4, 5, and 6. At
this point, in formation is en tered into the MARC work form with the
library&rsquo;s code at tached, and the cat aloging is done. Li braries that con-
tinue to use cards no lon ger pro duce the card sets on-site. In stead,
commercially pro duced cards are used to save staff time and to en -
sure the qual ity of the pro duction.
</p>
<p>Please be aware that ev ery li brary has its own rules and practices
for cat aloging rou tines. Most pro cedures man uals list tasks in or der
as fol lows:
</p>
<p>1. Materials are received.
2. Search database or other identified sources for cataloging in-
</p>
<p>formation.
3. If information is found, do copy cataloging.
4. If cataloging information is not found, do original cataloging.
5. For libraries with OPAC, enter all information onto the screen.
6. For libraries with cards, prepare and produce cards or buy cards
</p>
<p>from commercial vendors.
</p>
<p>The num ber of cards needed is de termined by the number of added
entries: a card for each sub ject heading, one main entry card, and one
shelflist card. Most of ten li braries will buy not only the card sets from 
commercial ven dors but also the com plete pro cessing ser vice, such
as spine la bels, pock ets, cards, etc. For libraries that pro duce their
own cards, a com puter pro gram such as The Li brarian&rsquo;s Helper: The
Pro fes sional Cat a loging Pro gram should be used. This type of pro -
gram is used on a stand-alone com puter and is de signed to pro duce
catalog cards in con formity with AACR2R stan dards, and to print la-
bels, pock ets, and cards. Such pro grams as the OCLC&rsquo;s Cat a loging
Label Program al low the cataloger to print la bels from the text files.

<p>Au to ma tion has changed the cat a log ing scene dra mat i cally. With
mem bers shar ing cat a log ing in for ma tion from the same da ta base,
each con tributing cat aloger has to ad here com pletely to the rules and
the stan dards, leav ing no room for in di vid ual in ter pre ta tion. The re-
sult of ex tensive use of on line cataloging sys tems has been that the
majority of the cataloging done in the library now is copy cat aloging.
This is dif ferent from the man ual system, which re quires that more
orig i nal cat a log ing be done. Staff com po si tion in the cat a log ing de-
partment has shifted also, with the library tech nician now the de part-
ment&rsquo;s back bone.
</p>
<p>PROCESSING ROUTINES
</p>
<p>Af ter the cat a log ing steps are com pleted, ma te ri als are pro cessed
so that they can be shelved in their proper places. The pro cessing rou -
tines dif fer from li brary to li brary. In gen eral, the following steps may 
be in cluded:
</p>
<p>1. Mark shelflist card (if still used) with proper identification
symbols, such as accession number, bar code number, or copy
number.
</p>
<p>2. File shelflist cards in order by call numbers.
3. File catalog cards (if still used) in the card catalog according to
</p>
<p>ALA Filing Rules, 1980.
4. Attach pockets, cards, and date-due slips to materials.
5. Stamp materials with the library property stamp on designated
</p>
<p>pages or places.
6. Place plastic jacket on book.
7. Prepare and attach spine labels.
8. Attach and scan in bar code labels.
9. Attach security strips.

<p>Au to ma tion sim pli fies the pro cess ing rou tines by elim i nat ing steps
such as typ ing, fil ing, and at taching pock ets and cards to the ma terials.

<p>FILING
</p>
<p>As noted ear lier, in au tomated libraries no fil ing needs to be done.
The com puter is pro grammed so that all ac cess points are in dexed
and, there fore, re trievable. Libraries with cards to file in the cat alog
should fol low the rules in ALA Fil ing Rules, 1980, published by the
American Li brary As sociation. Some of the most ba sic and most
commonly used rules are sum marized in Fig ure 9.1. Fig ure 9.2 shows 
ex am ples from the ALA Fil ing Rules, 1980. When in doubt, this ref er-
ence should be con sulted.
</p>
<p>Though there may not be shelflist cards to main tain, it is im portant
to learn how the call num bers are filed in or der, since this is the way
materials are shelved. Dewey call num bers are filed by clas sification
numbers first. For the same classification num bers, the au thor num -
bers are com pared, first al phabetically, then by dec imal num ber. The
following is an ex ample of a cor rect se quence:
</p>
<p>010 010 010.01 010.1 010.1 010.1
</p>
<p>.A19 .A2 .A131 .A121 .A13 .A13
</p>
<p>Ca Cr
</p>
<p>Library of Con gress call num bers are filed by letters first, then by
numbers, fol lowed by au thor num bers and other work marks. The
following is an ex ample of a cor rect se quence:
</p>
<p>H HA HA HA HC HV HV

</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all au thor num bers fol low a dec imal point, even
though the dec imal points mis takenly may not have been printed on
spine la bels or on cards. There fore, for two items with the same class
number 010, au thor num ber .A19 is filed be fore .A2.

<p>The job of fil ing, ac cording to the ALA Fil ing Rules 1980, is com -
pletely elim inated in computerized li braries that have closed the card
catalog and use only the on line pub lic ac cess cat alog (OPAC).
</p>
<p>Rou tines in main tain ing the card cat a log in clude re place ment of
worn and soiled cards, add ing see and see also ref erence cards as nec -

It should be em phasized again that ev ery li brary is dif ferent, and the
li brary tech ni cian work ing in the cat a log ing de part ment has to fol low 
the pol i cies and pro ce dures of that in di vid ual li brary.
</p>
<p>A cat alog or a da tabase is a liv ing thing. New en tries are en tered
every day, and at the same time, ti tles are de leted or cards are pulled
out con stantly. Ac curacy is im portant, and one should exercise great
care when fil ing cards or en tering any in formation into the da tabase,
be it the cor rect spell ing, the cor rect field, or the correct in dicator.
One card mis filed is one re cord lost for ever. The same situation oc -
curs in the com puter en vironment. When the bib liographic in forma-
tion is not en tered prop erly into the da tabase, the re cord may be
buried. Cat aloging has to be done with knowl edge and pre cision, and
that is why the task is both in teresting and chal lenging.

<p>Chapter 10
</p>
<p>Issues and Trends
</p>
<p>The cat aloging de partment of a li brary al ways has spe cial pro jects
to an tic i pate. Be cause of au to ma tion, prac tices and pro ce dures have
changed and copy cat a log ing has be come the pri mary re spon si bil ity
of the li brary tech nician. Un like the card cat alog which hides mis-
takes, the on line cat a log im me di ately ex poses all mis takes, and,
therefore, main tenance of the da tabase is a chal lenging task. To en -
sure that the database is one of high qual ity, great care must be ex er-
cised when matching or re-cre ating re cords on the com puter.
</p>
<p>Another con sequence of au tomation is the closing or freez ing of
the card catalog. Con verting a library&rsquo;s col lection to a machine read -
able for mat is an enor mous job, es pecially for libraries with big col-
lections. A li brary may de cide to fol low the new changes of the
cat a log ing rules or to switch to a dif fer ent clas si fi ca tion sys tem. The
library tech nician may be in volved in these pro jects and par ticipate in 
special as signments. For any pro ject, pol icies and pro cedures must be 
spelled out clearly, and in-house training should be pro vided for the
library tech nician. The following are some of the most com mon is -
sues that li braries deal with at the present time.
</p>
<p>RECLASSIFICATION
</p>
<p>Starting in the 1960s and early 1970s, many libraries, es pecially
academic li braries, de cided to switch from the Dewey Dec imal Clas -
si fi ca tion sys tem to the Li brary of Con gress Clas si fi ca tion sys tem.
</p>
<p>Al though it is rel a tively con ve nient for a com put er ized li brary with
an on line pub lic ac cess catalog to re classify its col lection, it is a time-
con sum ing, la bor-in ten sive pro ject. Bib lio graphic re cords have to be
</p>
<p>133</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>pulled from the da tabase and the classification num bers changed. The
spine la bels of the ma terials must be re written and the ma terials
reshelved. Be cause of the cost, many li braries have re classified only
the most commonly used ma terials and the new ac quisitions, re sult-
ing in li braries us ing both the Dewey and the Li brary of Con gress
Clas si fi ca tion sys tems.
</p>
<p>RECATALOGING
</p>
<p>Maintaining the cat alog is an on going, never-end ing task. As the cat a-
log ing rules con tin u ally change, li brary cat a logs, ei ther on line or card,
need to be changed. Also, clas sification num bers and sub ject headings
are up dated con stantly. Lost materials or any change of sta tus must be
reflected in the da tabase and any er rors discovered in the cat alog need to
be cor rected. Be sides the rou tine cataloging and pro cessing, there is al-
ways some pro ject to work on in the cat aloging de partment. Each li brary
has its own pol icy on how to deal with changes and new pro jects.
</p>
<p>CLOSING THE CARD CATALOG
</p>
<p>As au tomation be comes a com mon prac tice for many li braries, and
as pub lic ac cess ter minals are made avail able to the us ers, main taining
the card catalog be comes an in efficient use of both money and staff
time, and as a con sequence, the card cat alog is not kept up to date and
often is pro nounced closed or frozen. Af ter the to tal col lection is on -
line, many libraries dis card the card catalog or keep the old cat alog for
occasional ref erences. Closing the card cat alog saves valu able staff
time and money, elim inating fil ing and buy ing cards. Some libraries
may choose to keep a card shelflist file for staff use, but, gen erally, the
prac tice is dis con tin ued be cause shelflists can be con veniently printed
out for in ventory pur poses, etc.
</p>
<p>RETROSPECTIVE CONVERSION
</p>
<p>When li brar ies are au to mated, the new ac qui si tions are cat a loged
instantly online. For a li brary to cir culate ma terials that were cat a-
</p>
<p>134 Cataloging and Classification for Library Technicians</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>loged be fore au tomation took place, the in formation needs to be con-
verted from cat alog card to a ma chine read able for mat, a pro cess
referred to as ret ro spec tive con ver sion. Be cause ret ro spec tive con-
version is a costly, time-consuming pro ject, a library may con tract
the pro ject to a com mercial library ser vice com pany, or the pro ject
may be done for a fee by the net work or con sortium of which the li -
brary is a part. An ex ample of this ser vice co mes from OCLC, which
per forms con ver sion for in di vid ual li brar ies on a con trac tual ba sis,
employing a step-by-step pro cedure for ei ther the whole collection or 
for a spe cial col lection, such as for eign lan guage ma terials. Li braries
with a small bud get may de cide to complete the pro ject in-house,
with or with out ex tra help. When at tempted as an in-house pro ject
with no ex tra staff, a clear, step-by-step pro cedure man ual for the ret-
rospective con version pro ject needs to be in place.
</p>
<p>OUTSOURCING
</p>
<p>Throughout his tory, li braries have searched for cost-efficient ways to
provide ex cellent ser vices to us ers. One of the ideas and is sues much
talked about in the library world is outsourcing. Outsourcing means
turning over the re sponsibility of a cer tain task to a com mercial firm
for a fee. Li brary cat aloging is an ap propriate tar get for outsourcing
because the pro cess is time-con suming and staff need spe cial training
to per form the job well. In the past, li braries have outsourced non-
library-related ser vices such as clean ing or ac counting. For many
years, to save costs, li braries have or dered cards from the Library of
Congress and have con tracted library ven dors to sup ply cards and
com plete pro cess ing of ma te ri als. Outsourcing the whole cat a log ing
operation or even the whole tech nical ser vices de partment, and thus
elim i nat ing those de part ments com pletely, could be ad van ta geous
eco nom i cally. How ever, high qual ity re mains a con cern.
</p>
<p>COOPERATION
</p>
<p>As more li braries share ex penses, more ef ficient methods, and li -
brary ma te ri als, co op er a tion has be come the main stay. The net works
of li braries are get ting big ger. Many states now have con sortia that
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>in clude hun dreds of li brar ies. OCLC has 30,000 mem bers world wide,
and even the Library of Con gress is seek ing co operative en deav ors by
es tab lish ing pro jects such as Pro gram for Co op er a tive Cat a loging (PCC),
Name Au thor ity Co op er a tive (NACO), and Co op er a tive On line Se ri als Pro-
gram (CONSER). For more in formation, check the Li brary of Con gress Web 
site &lt;lcweb.loc.gov/catdir/pcc&gt;. A mile stone in co op er a tion in cat a log ing
was reached in 1996 when the rep resentatives of the Library of Con gress
and the Brit ish Li brary signed an agree ment called Mem orandum of
Agreement on Con vergence of Cat aloguing Pol icy, pav ing the way for
more seam less fu ture in ter ac tions.
</p>
<p>THE DUBLIN CORE
</p>
<p>A pres ent phe nom e non is the pro lif er a tion of in for ma tion avail able
on the Internet, where of ten in formation can not be re trieved easily. With
the cur rent in dexing sys tems, mostly Boolean and word search sys tems,
the search en gines can not pos sibly find all dis ciplines and cross-dis ci-
plin ary in for ma tion. Full cat a log ing for Internet ma te ri als is not fea si ble
because of the time, ef fort, and ex pertise in volved. Also, be cause the
Internet in formation is so ephem eral, a full cat aloging re cord is not
warranted, as in a reg ular li brary col lection. The Dub lin Core rep re-
sents the com promise for the situation. The goal is to de fine a core set
of metadata el ements (the coun terpart of cat alog data for printed ma te-
rials) that will al low au thors and in formation pro viders to de scribe
their work and facilitate interoperability among re source dis covery
tools. The re quired el ements in clude sub ject, title, au thor, pub lisher,
other agent, date, ob ject type, form, iden tifier, re lation, source, lan -
guage, and cov erage. A wide va riety of Internet in formation can be de-
scribed us ing such a cat aloging stan dard. As more in formation ap pears
on the Internet, the li brary tech nician may be re quired to do cataloging
according to the standard set by the Dub lin Core. For more information
on the Dub lin Core, check &lt;purf.org/metadata/dub lin_core&gt;.
</p>
<p>TRENDS
</p>
<p>What does the fu ture hold for cataloging? As the in dividual user is
able to re trieve more in formation by sub ject and by key word, it ap -
</p>
<p>136 Cataloging and Classification for Library Technicians</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>pears that the cat aloging pro cesses are be coming ob solete and that
the cat aloger may no lon ger be needed. On the contrary, the prac tice
of cat a log ing will be come more im por tant be cause the or ga ni za tional
aspect of the ever-increasing body of knowl edge and in formation is
the es sential ba sis of cat aloging. A wealth of in formation stored in
the com puter may be rendered use less un less it is or ganized well
enough to be re trieved quickly and eas ily. The pro cedures and prac -
tices may change, but the chal lenge for the cat aloger re mains more,
not less, im por tant in our in for ma tion-ori ented so ci ety.
</p>
<p>Some phe nomena, which al ready are de veloping or are pre dicted to
happen, will ap pear on the scene in the cat aloging world, in cluding the
following:
</p>
<p>1. Libraries will be automated and will catalog online. Even the
smallest libraries will be able to eliminate some parts of cataloging
and processing chores, if only with a stand-alone computer system.
</p>
<p>2. Libraries in the United States will have online public access
catalogs and discard their card catalogs.
</p>
<p>3. Libraries will join some kind of cooperative system, such as a
regional, national, or international network, to facilitate cata-
loging and other related functions.
</p>
<p>4. Print and nonprint materials will be cataloged with equal care,
applying the same rules, and will be intershelved.
</p>
<p>5. The role differences between copy catalogers and original cat-
alogers will become blurred. Catalogers will start out doing
copy cataloging and, if copy records cannot be found, will
proceed with original cataloging.
</p>
<p>6. With an automated system, key word search will become the
most popular way of searching for information. More access
points and less description of the materials will become the rule.
The Dublin Core agreement is an example. AACR2R rules will
be modified.
</p>
<p>7. Small libraries will still use the CD-ROM database to catalog.
Larger libraries or libraries with ample budgets will catalog on-
line.
</p>
<p>8. The Internet will be the union catalog of the world. More
libraries will use the Internet as a source for copy cataloging.
</p>
<p>Issues and Trends 137</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9. Library technicians will be hired instead of librarians to do
cataloging, making the library technicians&rsquo; job more demanding
and interesting, while keeping the cataloging cost down.
</p>
<p>10. Integrated online systems will get more involved with centralized
processing for member libraries.
</p>
<p>11. Libraries will outsource the technical services operations, includ-
ing cataloging, particularly cataloging of special collections.
</p>
<p>12. Cataloging departments will be merged into the automation or
bibliographic control departments because of the changing nature
of the job.
</p>
<p>13. Because library technicians are performing higher levels of cata-
loging, more education and training opportunities for library
technicians will be provided. Continuing education for library
technicians will be an important issue.
</p>
<p>14. Libraries will move away from perfect cataloging, adopting full
records from bibliographic utilities without editing or modification.
</p>
<p>Au to ma tion in li brar ies be gan in the cat a log ing de part ment and has
had its big gest im pact there. Li brary cat aloging and cat alogs have come
a long way. From hand written cards to typewriters, to du plicating fa cili-
ties, to per sonal com put ers, to com puter net works&mdash;li brary tech ni cians
have played, and will con tinue to play, a vi tal part in de veloping the new
and in novative as pects of the library. No mat ter what the fu ture holds,
