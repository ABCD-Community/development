<p>Preface
</p>
<p>Australian clinicians have long laboured in law schools and external clinical 
sites with too little appreciation and too many obstacles, but those days are 
coming to an end. Clinical legal education has taken a long time to come to 
the forefront of legal education in Australia, but that moment is here now.
</p>
<p>Australian law schools without a reputable clinical presence are fast 
becoming an anachronism. But as more and more law schools dip their 
toes into clinical experimentation, we see the potential for superficial 
courses and lower-quality educational outcomes. In the absence of agreed 
clinical pedagogies for Australian clinical programs, we may see mediocrity 
posing as diversity and&mdash;worse, to our minds&mdash;a diminution of focus on 
serving clients in poverty and striving for social justice. 
</p>
<p>This book sets out in detail the many complex issues associated with 
developing law students&rsquo; public-interested professionalism in an Australian 
context. In the process, we offer very practical guidance on how to construct 
and operate a &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; clinical legal education program, for the benefit 
of regulators, law deans, associate deans, colleagues and students, now and 
in the future. To support the book&rsquo;s continuing usefulness, we have used 
Harvard library permalinks, a reference system that ensures that the web 
links in the footnotes remain uncorrupted by the passage of time. To the 
same end, we have chosen to publish with ANU Press, ensuring that the 
book is accessible free online throughout the world.  
</p>
<p>We dedicate this book to the contributions of the late Sue Campbell 
and Guy Powles, as well as Neil Rees, all of whom were pioneers in our 
discipline and who stood their ground for the twin pillars of Australian 
clinical legal education: providing the best in both legal education and 
client service.

<p>Acknowledgements
</p>
<p>We acknowledge with considerable appreciation the contribution of 
Sandy McCullough to the editing and formatting of this book. Sandy 
has frequently gone further than many editors would do in helping us 
get to press. In the early stages of the research that underlies our work 
here, we were also greatly assisted by Ebony Booth, who managed our 
research team and ensured we were meeting our deadlines. Both Sandy 
and Ebony brought professionalism and good humour to their roles 
and made everything so much easier. There are many others&mdash;friends 
and colleagues&mdash;who have contributed ideas, comments and insight as 
we worked through the complex and challenging issues that this book 
addresses: Tony Foley, Frances Gibson, Richard Grimes, Vivien Holmes, 
Richard Johnstone, Michael McNamara, David McQuoid-Mason, 
Zoe&nbsp;Rathus, Simon Smith, Gai Walker, Kristen Wallwork, Denise&nbsp;Wasley 
and Leah Wortham, among them. We also acknowledge the many 
clinicians and law teachers across Australia who have offered their 
opinions and observations during our research phase. Without them, our 
prescription for powerful and accountable legal education would be far 
less confident.
</p>
<p>We would not have been able to formulate and agree on our mutual 
(and&nbsp; sometimes differing) perspectives without the growing sense of 
shared insight we acquired while working on the underlying research. 
That project forged a consensus that we have come to value and respect. 
We therefore thank the Australian Government&rsquo;s Office of Learning and 
Teaching for the grant that got us going in the first place. 
</p>
<p>Finally, each of us thanks our families, for their patience and support 
during our late nights and interrupted weekends and holidays.</p>

The reason for this book
</p>
<p>Why address Australian clinical legal 
education now?
Australian legal education is evolving rapidly in response to university 
competition for more students in perceived high-status courses. The lack 
of any caps on law enrolments, and the perception that some courses 
can be delivered less expensively online, have encouraged a belief that 
much larger numbers of students can be graduated from old and new law 
schools alike. The typical law school business model is increasingly and 
inevitably fee-driven, since graduate law students can be charged large 
amounts of money for their degrees.1
</p>
<p>At the same time, law schools are delivering larger numbers of graduates 
into a shrinking or, at best, stable legal jobs market. Regardless of the 
state of the Australian economy in any one period, overseas legal process 
providers are succeeding in standardising and commodifying local, routine 
legal work at such levels that many local law graduates, particularly those 
without much or any experience of legal practice or who don't have 
family connections, struggle to get jobs.2 And there is every indication

</p>
<p>that the application of artificial intelligence to many legal processes is 
only in its infancy, so&nbsp;that the number of local legal jobs may never return 
to buoyancy under the sheer weight and number of instantly accessible 
overseas providers, combined with these emerging technologies.
</p>
<p>There may be no solution to this economic pincer movement if governments 
remain unwilling to cap law enrolments. In fact, the opposite may be 
the case, as free-trade agreements increasingly specify greater access to 
Australian higher education.3 But there is also a strong desire for quality 
legal education through the development of standards, particularly the 
threshold learning outcomes project,4 and law school legal educators 
are increasingly committed to doing things better, not just to withstand 
the above pressures, but to fulfil their own desires for excellence. Even if 
legal education and legal employment is being squeezed, many academic 
law teachers believe that the social and justice values of the Australian 
legal profession cannot be allowed to wither for want of law graduates 
who are practice-ready, ethically aware and intending to contribute to 
justice and social equity.5 Contemporary major reviews of legal education 
in the United States and the United Kingdom&mdash;discussed in detail in 
Chapter 10&mdash;concur that clinical legal education is a key strategy not just 
for legal educators determined to strengthen law graduates&rsquo; professional 
capacities, but also in support of the wider and more fundamental task 
of&nbsp;maintaining the rule of law.
</p>
<p>This book is dedicated to those teachers and law schools who view 
academic legal education as a force for good and, in particular, to an 
aspect of that process&mdash;clinical legal education&mdash;that has the best chance 
of&nbsp;strengthening legal education and hence law graduates of the future. 
</p>
<p>Clinical teachers largely appreciate that they are &lsquo;on a mission&rsquo; to 
strengthen legal education and have gathered for irregular conferences 
at different law schools since the 1980s. As referred to in Chapter 3,

</p>
<p>Kingsford Legal Service (a clinical site of the University of New South 
Wales law school) publishes an annual guide to current Australian 
clinical programs in an effort to disseminate knowledge of their depth 
and breadth. Of course, the clinical legal education &lsquo;movement&rsquo; is not 
alone in a desire to improve legal education. The federal government&rsquo;s 
Office of Learning and Teaching (OLT),6 the Council of Australian Law 
Deans (CALD),7 the Law Admissions Consultative Committee (LACC)8 
and the Australian Professional Legal Education Council (APLEC),9 
which oversees pre-admission practical legal training, are all attempting 
to improve educational quality in different ways. 
</p>
<p>Regulatory bodies are well aware of the potential and the capacity of 
clinical legal education to improve law courses and they interact routinely 
with law school deans. The Victorian regulator of that state&rsquo;s law schools&rsquo; 
curricula, the then Council of Legal Education,10 was closely involved in 
our research phase and is influential in other jurisdictions. Similarly, the 
Australia New Zealand Law Admissions Consultative Committee (LACC) 
reports to the Council of Australian and New Zealand Chief Justices 
and counts CALD among its membership.11 But these are institutional 
bodies rather than actual teachers. While this book is addressed to 
clinical teachers&mdash;&lsquo;clinicians&rsquo;&mdash;and intending clinicians, it will also be 
of considerable use to law school leaders and legal professionals with an 
interest in legal education. It is written by clinicians and is informed by 
empirical research conducted by them. That research led to the September 
2012 report known as &lsquo;Best&nbsp;Practices: Australian Clinical Legal Education&rsquo; 
and then to the larger final published report, Best Practices: Australian

<p>Clinical Legal&nbsp; Education (2013) (referred to here as Best Practices).12 
Throughout this book, we refer to the best practices developed for those 
reports because, as we describe in Chapter 10, they are the product of a 
research program and are not just a matter of individual opinion.
</p>
<p>Each of the following chapters represents a tangible extension of Best 
Practices. We became acutely aware during the research process that each 
of the topics we address has individual importance, not just as a descriptor 
of some aspect of Australian clinical legal education, but as a key element 
in the best of clinical legal education. These topics did not suddenly 
emerge in a flash of light. Long and sometimes difficult debates about 
what the research process had uncovered were followed by agreement 
and then U-turns, as often as not. Gradually, a shared understanding of 
what is truly best, and not just good or better, emerged from a digestion 
of&nbsp;research reports and the literature, and our reflection on both. 
</p>
<p>This book takes Best Practices one step further, or perhaps one step deeper. 
In that report we condensed the underlying debates into concise statements 
so that key players, especially law deans, might readily accept that clinical 
legal education is not just an option within wider legal education, but a 
necessity for the best of legal education. That task was achieved in the 
unanimous adoption of our best practices by CALD in November 2012.13 
</p>
<p>Now, our (educational) task is to more clearly inform and persuade 
Australian colleagues not just of the depth and potential of clinical legal 
education, but also of the detailed operational issues that, when confronted, 
</p>
<p>12  The development of this report occurred during 2010&ndash;12. An application by Adrian Evans in 
2009 to the then Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) (now the Office for Learning 
and Teaching (OLT)) led to a research grant to investigate clinical teaching practices in Australian law 
schools with a view to improving and strengthening student learning in clinics and, hence, the wider 
law curriculum. The authors of this book (other than Peter Joy) were joint researchers (along with 
Ebony Booth) in this project. Regional surveys of all Australian law schools allowed the identification 
of all those offering a clinical course or utilising clinical legal methods in their teaching. Analyses of 
these clinicians&rsquo; responses to subsequent surveys and interviews permitted the authors to develop best 
practices in clinical legal education. The document titled &lsquo;Best Practices: Australian Clinical Legal 
Education Sept 2012&rsquo; contains only those best practices and was uploaded to the CALD website in 
November 2012 after it had been endorsed by CALD. It is document number 14 and can be found 
at perma.cc/BY6N-6SRF. For the larger final project report, published in 2013, see Adrian Evans, 
Anna Cody, Anna Copeland, Jeff Giddings, Mary Anne Noone, Simon Rice and Ebony Booth, 
Best Practices: Australian Clinical Legal Education (cited hereafter as Best Practices), which can be 
downloaded from the OLT website: www.olt.gov.au/resource-best-practices-Australian-clinical-legal-
education; perma.cc/2J6E-ZMQX. Ebony Booth was a research assistant on the research project and 
contributed considerably to its organisation, background research and management. The supporting

<p>will result in the best clinical legal education. This task is not simple. 
The&nbsp;greater use of clinical teaching methods in Australian law schools is 
yet to be matched by a strong understanding of the pedagogical choices 
required to maximise this most powerful of teaching methods. This lack 
of strong engagement with the pedagogy of clinical legal education was 
one catalyst for Best Practices, but such a commitment remains elusive. In 
this book we use the research results that led to Best Practices as a pathway 
into the discussion of these key areas of engagement. Each is canvassed 
thoroughly by one or two of us as authors of a chapter, with moderation 
provided by each of the other authors.
</p>
<p>Coverage of chapters
The primary authorship of each chapter varies and, to that extent, 
there will be a difference in voice in each chapter, albeit one that has 
been moderated by the comments of every other author. Chapter 2 is 
primarily the work of Jeff Giddings, and dissects the extended context of 
Australian legal education generally, explaining the regulatory framework 
and distinguishing clinical legal education from practical legal training, 
service learning and pro bono programs, while discussing the relationship 
with work-integrated learning. Beyond scene-setting, we discuss in 
Chapter 2 the need for a functioning &lsquo;ethical infrastructure&rsquo; to strengthen 
the professionalism of clinical legal practice. Finally, Chapter 2 offers an 
extended overview of the state of play in Australian legal education and 
its relationship to clinical legal education, including the currently vexing 
issues of wellness and depression and their effect on all law students&rsquo; 
performance.
</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is authored by Mary Anne Noone and Anna Cody. It reflects 
the multilayered debates about definitions and the proliferation of terms 
that always come up whenever clinical legal education is discussed. 
This&nbsp; chapter appears early on in the book so that readers can be clear 
about what is actually meant by terms such as clinical legal education, a 
clinic, a client and a &lsquo;model&rsquo;. Different models of clinical legal education 
are suited to making different contributions to aims and learning 
outcomes. Phrases such as &lsquo;in-house live client clinic&rsquo;, &lsquo;in-house live 
client clinic (some&nbsp;external funding)&rsquo;, &lsquo;external live client clinic (agency 
clinic)&rsquo;, &lsquo;externships (includes internships and placements)&rsquo; and &lsquo;clinical 
components&rsquo; are all identified, distinguished and justified. Chapter 3 will </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>be of special interest to clinicians and law deans looking at externships 
because of tight budgets. Externships and agency clinics are increasingly 
the point of entry to clinical legal education for smaller law schools because 
of the view that they cost less to implement and run. The conflict about 
whether a simulated experience is or is not &lsquo;clinical&rsquo; is also addressed, for 
similar reasons.
</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, Simon Rice tackles good course design. It is a first-order 
mistake to simply begin a clinic and hope for the best, because it is only 
possible to assess whether a clinic is successful by measuring it against the 
aim behind its establishment. In clarifying clinical aims and objectives, 
the design process identifies the potential to shape clinical experiences 
in order to make them as constructive as possible for students and other 
communities. The provision of clinical experience involves broader and 
significantly more complex learning outcomes beyond the acquisition of 
practical skills. Course aims can include the promotion of legal doctrine, 
addressing specific social issues, developing legal and/or professional skills, 
promotion of social values, strengthening of legal theory or social justice, 
the provision of public service or the development of legal policy and law 
reform. The chapter also looks at the options for student selection, a topic 
that will become increasingly important as student pressure for selection 
into clinical legal education programs increases.
</p>
<p>Chapter 5 is composed by Anna Cody and Simon Rice and recognises 
that notions of justice are the central framework for our endeavours 
as clinicians. Social justice inspired the emergence of clinics, both in 
Australia and elsewhere, and should, in our view, continue to guide their 
development. The chapter explores what justice means for contemporary 
clinical legal education, whether community legal education, community 
development, strategic litigation or policy advocacy leading to law reform. 
But there is a recurring debate&mdash;encouraged to some extent by the 
prevailing conservative political mood of the last decade&mdash;should clinics 
be about social justice at all, or only really about direct service and student 
learning? In an era when some new clinics may attempt to provide business 
advice or deliver services for a fee, it might be suggested that our emphasis 
on a justice focus for clinical programs is pass&eacute;. We&nbsp; do not agree and 
are confident that the socially appropriate focus of an Australian clinical 
program is the promotion of justice for clients and clients&rsquo; interests, and 
of students&rsquo; appreciation of this priority as they grow in confidence and 
understanding of injustice in contemporary societies. Clinical education 
is significantly more than a &lsquo;mechanistic&rsquo; educational methodology.  </p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>1 . The ReASon foR ThiS booK
</p>
<p>Chapter 6 deals with clinical supervision, perhaps the most neglected 
of clinical skills as well as the most important for the best clinical legal 
education. Jeff Giddings makes a strong case for effective supervision 
as central to clinical pedagogy, and that effective practices need to be 
developed in order to enable students to learn as much as possible from 
their (relatively short) clinic experience. And the unexpected benefits 
for supervisors are not forgotten: because good supervision is mutually 
enriching for supervisor and supervisee alike, competent supervision 
training is likely to be a strengthening and re-energising experience for 
all. Clinicians will be particularly interested in supervision from the 
point of view of the sometimes problematic externship clinic, where 
the practice environment can permit less than effective supervision and 
where clinicians may have less access to good supervision training. Online 
supervision poses particular challenges, but the underlying principles 
of effective supervision, affirmed in our research program, are identical 
regardless of media. Importantly for new clinics, the chapter addresses 
the sensitive topic of supervision ratios, that is, the maximum number of 
students that a law school ought to require a clinician to simultaneously 
supervise; and offers practical, accessible guidance for new supervisors.
</p>
<p>A popular but not well understood aspect of clinical legal education is the 
power of reflection. This issue is explored in great depth by Anna Copeland 
in Chapter 7. Anna asks rhetorically whether reflection is as important to 
clinicians and their students as water is to human survival. Clinical legal 
education cannot do without it. Good reflection by a student means that 
their mistakes are less likely to be repeated and, in grasping that simple 
insight, students learn how to learn indefinitely. Optimal clinical legal 
education involves a circular sequence of experience, reflection, theory, 
practice, and then further reflection. The best reflective practice exposes 
students sensitively but sharply to the essentially positivist nature of much 
law teaching and, in that moment, encourages them to get involved in 
serious law reform and community development. Students are enabled 
through reflection to continue to learn from their own experience, long 
after they have left their clinic. The chapter leads into a wider discussion 
about clinical assessment in Chapter 8, by raising questions about how 
reflection can be taught and assessed. For example, should clinical legal 
education even attempt to assess a student&rsquo;s capacity for reflection, 
or&nbsp;should the essentially intimate nature of reflection justify its remaining 
private and unexplored?</p>

</p>
<p>The assessment of students&rsquo; clinical performance is next on our list 
of &lsquo;must discuss&rsquo; clinical legal education issues. Assessment is often 
an afterthought in a new clinical legal education program, but not in 
this book. In&nbsp; Chapter&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; Adrian Evans highlights why assessment is 
critical to achieving course aims and objectives and can lead to student 
dissatisfaction if not thought through carefully. For example, if a law 
school operates a criminal defence or Innocence clinic (the latter aims 
to achieve post-conviction pardons in the light of new evidence), 
how will clinic performance be measured if there are few acquittals or 
releases of clients from custody? Assessment must be thought through 
so that its components are significantly wider than the success of client 
representation. It can occur in different forms, with some programs 
preferring to grade only on a pass/fail basis, while others prefer the full 
range from fail through to distinction. 
</p>
<p>Chapter 9 is also authored by Adrian Evans and discusses adequate staffing 
and infrastructure levels in Australian clinics, depending on the type of 
clinic and its learning objectives. Under-resourced (that is, underfunded) 
clinics face major challenges, so that finding ways to involve a range of 
external partners has potential to promote the contributions clinics can 
make. Chapter 9 also recognises that even the well-structured clinic will 
decline if people with inadequate skills are appointed to run it. We&nbsp;pay 
specific attention to clinical directors, administrators and &lsquo;coal-face&rsquo; 
clinicians, and provide a table that lists minimum resources needed in 
different clinic structures. 
</p>
<p>In Chapter 10, Peter Joy provides international comparisons, along with a 
very helpful analysis, of the approaches taken to strengthening live client 
clinical legal education by each of the United Kingdom, the United States 
of America and Australia. The analysis highlights what is distinctive about 
Australia&rsquo;s approach (for example, the dual emphasis on both education 
and service), and helps clinicians reflect on what is generic to all good 
programs and what ought to be improved in Australian clinical legal 
education (for example, the academic status of clinicians). The chapter 
concludes with a cross-referenced table, offering a valuable overview of 
the general focus of each country&rsquo;s set of best clinical practices.
</p>
<p>In our concluding Chapter 11, Mary Anne Noone discusses the links 
between some recent developments in Australian clinical legal education 
and emerging trends in legal education, legal practice and the delivery 
of legal aid services. Mary Anne&rsquo;s focus is the changing legal educational </p>

Since then, the rise of the JD degree coupled with federal regulatory 
developments has improved the climate for greater penetration of clinical 
methods into Australian law schools. And clinicians themselves are 
strengthening and deepening their commitment, though never in smooth 
waters. The resilience of clinical teachers in adapting to course restrictions 
caused by reductions in community legal aid funding, is a case in point. 
Yet the innovative spirit of these teachers remains constant, particularly 
in their creation of cross-jurisdictional and multidisciplinary clinics and 
in their participation in global justice movements of various dimensions. 
It is for good reason that Australian clinicians are now well-regarded 
contributors to a number of emerging Southeast Asian clinical programs.

<p>Conclusion
Australian clinical legal education remains a rapidly evolving phenomenon. 
Our prior efforts to underpin this growth and depth with an empirically 
based report and analysis of current practices were a necessary precursor 
to this book. Here we set out our understanding of the thematic history 
of clinical legal education in this country&mdash;and of its transformative 
potential for legal education&mdash;in the light of that research and of our 
subsequent experiences and reflection. </p>

Clinics and Australian law 
schools approaching 2020
</p>
<p>Introduction
In this chapter, we consider the place of clinical legal education in 
Australian legal education generally.1 We chart the countervailing currents 
set to influence the prominence and direction of Australian clinics as they 
approach 2020 with Australia&rsquo;s entire higher education sector facing very 
turbulent times. The chapter is designed to set the scene for the key aspects 
of clinical legal education addressed in subsequent chapters. We argue 
that clinics can and should make multiple contributions to Australian 
legal education, including fostering student commitment to concepts of 
justice and raising awareness of how the law and legal processes impact 
on people. 
</p>
<p>Law schools and their clinical programs are subject to a range of powerful 
influences.2 The prospects for clinics, being part of the higher education 
sector, will continue to be shaped by the actions of regulators and by 
broader university agendas. The judiciary and legal profession have

<p>important roles to play in supporting the work of clinics. Economic 
challenges, such as those generated by the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 
and, more recently, federal government policy shifts and budget cuts, 
appear set to slow the recent momentum that has seen many Australian 
law schools develop new clinical programs.3
</p>
<p>The contributions of clinical legal education
Experiential learning has the potential to contribute to achieving a range 
of objectives for students, clients and law schools. This generates both 
opportunities and challenges for those responsible for clinical programs. 
The capacity to both broaden and deepen student learning is central to 
clinical legal education. Students can benefit from a sustained experience 
enabling them to develop understandings and approaches that foster 
ethical and reflective practice. Academics, supervisors and students 
involved in clinical programs can make a broad range of research-related 
contributions, especially where projects require a breadth of knowledge 
and expertise.4 Clinicians are also likely to be able to engage effectively 
with the public policy dimensions of research issues and identify ways to 
utilise knowledge from other disciplines. Importantly, clinical programs 
also provide law schools with a natural point of focus for community 
service, ethical reflection and professional engagement activities. 
</p>
<p>The service dimension of clinical legal education can generate substantial 
community benefits while promoting student awareness of social justice 
and commitment to pro bono values. These benefits are evident from the 
history of Australian clinical legal education, which reveals an enduring 
commitment to social justice and service.5 Many Australian clinics continue

<p>to view community service as an integral element of their programs.6 
Commitment to justice and client service can usefully be extended beyond 
clinics to inform other elements of the work of law schools, as we discuss 
in Chapter 5. A more recent connection between clinical methods and 
ethical practice is also emerging for law schools, as they seek to respond to 
broader community calls for lawyers who are ethically aware and resilient. 
We discuss the concept of &lsquo;ethical infrastructure&rsquo;, as it affects clinics, later 
in this chapter.
</p>
<p>Clinical legal education and other forms of experiential legal education 
offer a more complete package than other pedagogies, but they do so 
with the cost of often intensive student supervision. At its most effective, 
Australian clinical legal education is distinguished from other forms of 
&lsquo;learning by doing&rsquo; by its commitment to social justice and the structured 
approach taken to student supervision. As will be discussed later in this 
chapter, the focus of clinical legal education is more developmental than 
is the case for placement arrangements in the practical legal training 
(PLT) programs that law graduates must complete prior to professional 
admission. Clinical programs in Australia also tend to provide greater 
structure and require greater student responsibility than work-integrated 
learning experiences and student volunteer programs. 
</p>
<p>Clinical legal education and service learning share a strong commitment to 
social justice. As we discuss later in this chapter, service learning involves 
students and academics working on legal issues often generated by crisis 
circumstances.7 The unpredictability involved in responding to crises 
tends to make it challenging to use such experiences as the centre point 
of an experiential learning framework. Service learning may have a more 
important role to play as a site for more advanced clinic-type experiences.

</p>
<p>Clinical legal education has potential to make a substantial contribution 
to legal education generally, through integrating practical insights and 
theoretical understandings in order to transcend the current doctrinal 
focus. But there remains a long way to go until this potential is embraced 
by the legal academy in Australia. Until this integrative potential is 
harnessed, clinics are unlikely to feature prominently in professional 
admission requirements and in the standards set for law schools. Those 
charged with developing clinical legal education face the significant 
challenge of building the level of awareness of these programs among 
public policymakers, members of the judiciary and the practising legal 
profession as well as within both their universities and their law schools.8
</p>
<p>At the very time that many Australian law schools are responding to 
university agendas related to experiential learning,9 the viability of current 
models of clinical legal education may be called into question by various 
factors. These include changes to how the legal profession and legal 
education are structured and regulated, along with dramatic growth in 
the numbers of law schools and law graduates seeking to enter the legal 
profession. These changes are examined in the next part of this chapter. 
We then consider the likely implications for clinical legal education of 
sector-wide developments, namely the promotion of work-integrated 
learning and capstone experiences. The chapter ends by addressing the 
relationship between student wellbeing, learning and service, and the 
potential for clinical legal education to contribute to the development 
of resilient legal professionals with an enhanced awareness of ethically 
appropriate behaviour.
</p>
<p>Dramatic growth in the number of law schools
Australia has seen a significant increase in the numbers of law schools and 
law students over the past 25 years, and this has fostered the development 
of a range of new clinical programs. Barker refers to an &lsquo;avalanche of law 
schools&rsquo;, with their numbers trebling since the Dawkins reforms to tertiary 
education in the late 1980s.10 In 1998, Chesterman described the new

<p>&lsquo;third wave&rsquo; law schools as having filled some of the many gaps in legal 
education.11 Lansdell refers to a dramatic increase in student numbers, 
from 11,254 studying law in 1984 to 36,331 studying law or legal studies 
in 2000.12 More recently, Thornton and Shannon have argued that 
Australian law schools offer prospective law students an illusion of choice 
that emphasises employability and glamour. They are rightly critical of law 
school branding that pays insufficient attention to &lsquo;the centrality of justice 
and critique&rsquo;.13 Their analysis could have usefully considered the potential 
of clinic-based learning and service to make a major contribution to the 
development of a justice-focused legal education.14 Those involved in 
clinical legal education have long emphasised its potential beyond being 
merely a &lsquo;head start&rsquo; program for those soon to enter the profession.15 
As we noted earlier, Australian clinical legal education continues to be 
strongly linked to various access to justice agendas.
</p>
<p>The Dawkins reforms promoted the establishment of new law schools, 
but did so in a manner that generated financial pressures to maximise 
student numbers. Since 1991, the federal government has used a Relative 
Funding Model to allocate operating grants to universities. Law is placed 
in the lowest of five discipline funding clusters (along with economics, 
accounting and various humanities disciplines) with a weighting of 1.16

</p>
<p>By&nbsp;contrast, the top cluster (comprising medicine, dentistry and veterinary 
science) has a weighting of 2.7. Higher clusters received more funds per 
student enrolled. Consequently, and perhaps inevitably, less expensive 
ways of teaching were reinforced as the default approach in Australian 
law schools.17
</p>
<p>While some law schools have recently created new experiential learning 
opportunities, the pedagogy informing some of these programs requires 
further development. Our research for Best Practices revealed considerable 
variation among clinical programs in terms of the responsibility given 
to students, supervisory processes and the classroom component 
accompanying the clinic experience.18 Further, the resource-intensive 
nature of clinical programs has contributed to their remaining elective 
courses rather than becoming a compulsory part of the curriculum. 
In&nbsp;an effort to reduce costs, some law schools have relied on unpaid and 
unsupported external supervisors. While external placements have great 
potential to provide students with excellent learning opportunities, they 
require careful structuring in terms of the supervision arrangements and 
the academic component linked to the placement. Some of these newer 
programs may also be underperforming in any effort to inculcate a justice 
focus in their students. Unless close attention is paid to the pedagogy 
that underpins experiential learning, Australian law schools may end up 
in a&nbsp;&lsquo;race to the bottom&rsquo; that emphasises the practice-oriented experience 
at&nbsp;the expense of the justice-oriented learning we discuss in Chapter 5.
</p>
<p>Regulation of law schools
The Council of Australian Law Deans (CALD) has adopted Standards 
for Australian Law Schools,19 which address a range of matters related to 
the operation of law schools and law courses. The standards facilitated 
the establishment of the Australian Law Schools Standards Committee

<p>(CALD standards committee). The committee is independent of CALD 
and has responsibility for certifying whether a law school complies with 
these voluntary standards,20 a process that began in 2015. 
</p>
<p>It remains too early to say whether the CALD standards committee 
will produce meaningful change, but at least the standards refer to the 
potential contributions clinics can make to law school engagement with 
the wider community. However, it should be emphasised that they do 
so only in aspirational terms, as an example of experiential learning.21 
This&nbsp; lukewarm endorsement of clinics should be contrasted with the 
references to clinical legal education in the arguments made by CALD in 
efforts to reverse the history of underfunding of law schools. In its 2007 
submission to the Review of the Impact of the Higher Education Support 
Act 2003: Funding Cluster Mechanism, CALD stated: 
</p>
<p>It is now widely accepted that legal education should have a clinical 
or industry placement component, with students having hands-on 
experience with real clients; yet clinical programs are so expensive that 
only a handful of law schools have been able to fund them adequately, 
usually with substantial external support, to which many law schools 
do&nbsp;not have easy access.22
</p>
<p>Australian law schools have also faced other recent regulatory changes. 
The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) 
was established in 2011 with responsibility for ensuring compliance 
with the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). The AQF is the 
national policy that sets the specifications for regulated qualifications in 
Australia.23 One of the key reference points for the operation of the AQF 
in terms of law studies is the Threshold Learning Outcomes (TLOs) for 
Law published in 2010 as part of the Learning and Teaching Academic 
Standards component of the AQF.24 TLOs have been developed for a range 
of disciplines and are defined in terms of minimum discipline knowledge,

</p>
<p>discipline-specific skills and professional capabilities including attitudes 
and professional values that are expected of a graduate from a specified 
level of program in a specified discipline area.25 Clinical legal education 
can make vital contributions to law students&rsquo; achieving each of the 
following six TLOs: 
</p>
<p>&bull; understanding a coherent body of knowledge;
&bull; developing understandings and abilities related to ethics and professional 
</p>
<p>responsibility;26
</p>
<p>&bull; developing relevant thinking skills;
&bull; developing research-related skills;
&bull; being able to communicate and collaborate; and
&bull; being able to self-manage.27
</p>
<p>The application of the sector-wide AQF to the law discipline has been 
strongly criticised. The University of New South Wales Law Dean, 
Professor David Dixon, described the AQF as providing &lsquo;a series of round 
holes into which our square pegs don&rsquo;t fit&rsquo;.28 The AQF specifications for 
Honours and Master&rsquo;s degrees were identified as likely to damage law 
programs without benefit, especially in relation to providing significant 
disincentives for international students to study law in Australia.29
</p>
<p>The far-reaching higher education reforms announced by the federal 
government in the 2014 budget have the potential to impact dramatically 
on the number of law schools in Australia and their focus. The changes 
may also see the emergence of new private providers in the legal education 
market with programs designed to fill perceived gaps in the market. 
</p>
<p>The globalisation of legal education may generate further regulatory 
requirements for Australia. In a 2011 report, Flood referred to the 
influence of factors that include the greater mobility of lawyers, 
technological developments, greater specialisation and outsourcing, and

<p>noted &lsquo;an inexorable move in the world towards the Americanisation 
of legal education, in the form of the widespread adoption of the 
JD&nbsp;degree over the LLB&rsquo;.30 Flood&rsquo;s report referred to the significance of 
the American Bar Association (ABA) Law School Accreditation Standards 
and its recent moves to &lsquo;liberalize legal education by permitting more 
online instruction, less security for faculty, and various other changes&rsquo;.31 
The ABA Standards include requirements for provision of clinical legal 
education opportunities for students as well as safeguards for the status 
and employment of clinicians.32 It is likely that Australian law schools 
wishing to develop and maintain their place in the developing &lsquo;Global JD&rsquo; 
market may need to provide their students with clinic-based experiences 
comparable to those offered by United States law schools. 
</p>
<p>Practical legal training and preparation for 
reflective&nbsp;practice?
There have also been dramatic changes in the professional training 
required of law graduates in order to gain admission to legal practice in 
Australia. Across Australia, the traditional articles of clerkship have largely 
been replaced with PLT programs (offered by law schools and private 
providers) and workplace traineeships.33 While these PLT programs can 
generate considerable educational benefits,34 the placement experiences 
offered to students vary considerably in terms of duration, currently 
from three weeks35 to 16 weeks,36 and nature. Some programs rely on the 
student to secure their placement, and almost all permit students to claim

vast majority of students, the classroom is a virtual one, with most PLT 
programs engaged in online delivery. Lansdell has plausibly argued that 
programs that blend classroom-based work with online study will be more 
effective than those that are solely online.40 This analysis could usefully be 
extended to include making full use of the learning potential of placement 
experiences. The current standards make no reference to workplace 
experience requirements, while the standards that came into operation on 
1 January 2015 require a workplace experience of only at least 15&nbsp;days.41 
It is conceivable that these days will be more widely separated than in 
the past and involve a wider range of placement sites. If accreditation 
arrangements were to move beyond requiring students to complete a 
prescribed number of hours of activities, and were to focus instead on 
key experiences that students must successfully undertake in collaboration 
with a skilled supervisor, then there might be reduced emphasis on the 
number of days while enabling recognition of the added value of clinic-
based learning.42
</p>
<p>Playing &lsquo;pass the parcel&rsquo;: Confusion in Australia&rsquo;s 
legal education framework
The place of clinical teaching methodologies in Australian legal education 
is left uncertain by the continuing lack of clarity around the functions 
of the different stages of the legal education process. In many instances, 
the academic stage of legal education provided by law schools and the 
professional (or vocational) stage provided by PLT programs operate as

</p>
<p>disconnected parts of an uncoordinated system. The most prominent 
exceptions to this ad hoc approach have been the clinic-focused 
Professional Program pioneered by the University of Newcastle Law 
School in the 1990s43 and the integrated PLT programs at the law schools 
of the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and Flinders University, 
but even these programs lack clear alignment with the supervised legal 
practice period required of all newly admitted practitioners.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some involved in legal education continue to conflate 
clinical legal education with the PLT requirements that law graduates 
must complete prior to admission to practice. As we discuss in Chapters 
4 and 5 in this book, the focus of many undergraduate clinical programs 
is on critique, exploration and the development of real-world judgment, 
rather than on the need to meet competency requirements. It is a matter 
of concern that legal education authorities have not taken up the challenge 
of finding ways for these phases to work constructively together. However, 
this task may now have become culturally and logistically easier with the 
advent of uniform regulation of legal practice across Victoria and New 
South Wales in 2015. 
</p>
<p>The superior courts in each Australian state and territory play a central 
role in setting requirements for admission to legal practice. In&nbsp;accrediting 
law degrees, the focus of the admitting authorities in each state and 
territory, and of the Law Council of Australia&rsquo;s Law Admissions 
Consultative Committee, has been on ensuring coverage of particular 
areas of substantive law with limited attention to the approaches used to 
foster student learning.44
</p>
<p>The only regulatory requirements for law students to learn in a practice 
setting involve requirements in PLT programs, and in most instances they 
require only an unstructured placement in a legal workplace. Australian 
regulators should recognise the value of giving law students opportunities 
to engage in &lsquo;learning by doing and reflecting&rsquo; prior to undertaking their 
PLT. As discussed earlier, focusing on practical skills development leaves 
</p>
<p>43  For an account of the development of the University of Newcastle Law School Professional 
Program, see Giddings (2013), Chapter 8.
44  In 2004 Keyes and Johnstone highlighted that the nationally unified requirements for admission 
to the legal profession are preoccupied with issues of content rather than pedagogy. Minimal attention 
has been paid to addressing graduate attributes, skills and theoretical perspectives: Mary Keyes and 
Richard Johnstone, cited at footnote 16, 538. See also Vivienne Brand, &lsquo;Decline in the Reform of 
Law Teaching?&rsquo; (1999) 10 Legal Education Review 109, 125&ndash;26; and Richard Johnstone and Sumitra 
Vignaendra, cited at footnote 16, Chapters 1 and 2.</p>

</p>
<p>the full educational potential of clinical legal education unfulfilled. Rather, 
clinics should be recognised for their capacity to develop students&rsquo; ability 
to learn from experience, and to connect their classroom learning to the 
practice of law. Clinical legal education can make a major contribution 
to law students&rsquo; ability to develop their understanding of the ethical 
dimensions of the law and legal processes.45 This is particularly the case 
with undergraduate and JD clinics, where the students can be engaged 
in understanding and exploring key concepts, rather than in meeting 
competency standards as is required in PLT programs.
</p>
<p>Greater use of experiential learning models, and their integration across 
the academic and professional stages of legal education would, of course, 
have resource implications for law schools. Regulators have an important 
role to play in encouraging universities and governments to address the 
historic inadequacy of resources committed to legal education.46 In the 
face of limited resources, such requirements are unlikely to be voluntarily 
developed by law schools themselves. The United States&rsquo; experience of 
accreditation standards imposed by the ABA provides a valuable example 
of a regulator fostering law school engagement with clinical methods.47 
If&nbsp;accreditation requirements are to be used to promote the broader use of 
such methods, then it will be valuable for such arrangements to recognise 
the additional benefits students derive from participation in effectively 
structured and supervised clinical experiences as compared to other less 
coherent forms of exposure to legal practice. Students are likely to learn 
much more when engaged in collaborative work with an experienced 
supervisor who will harness the learning potential of clinical experiences.
</p>
<p>Limited availability of clinical placements, and the underdeveloped 
nature&nbsp; of clinical pedagogy in Australia, mean there is heavy reliance 
on graduates learning &lsquo;on the job&rsquo; without being effectively prepared for 
the rigours of professional life during their legal education. Often these 
graduates have had little or no exposure to practice-based learning designed 
to enhance their capacity for reflective practice, and reliance is placed on up 
to two years of &lsquo;supervised legal practice&rsquo; that must be completed by newly

<p>admitted lawyers before they can hold a full practising certificate.48 Despite 
this reliance, only limited guidance is provided in relation to the meaning 
of supervision and appropriate supervision practices. In&nbsp;particular, there 
is no guidance on the training and development function of supervision 
and its place in the overall legal education framework. Nor are there 
any legislative references to the importance of the concept of reflection 
and its role in law students&rsquo; learning. It is noteworthy, however, that 
the Australian Government Productivity Commission&rsquo;s 2014 Access 
to Justice Arrangements Inquiry Report contains a recommendation for 
the Australian Government to conduct a holistic review of the current 
status of the three stages of legal education in consultation with the state 
and&nbsp; territory governments, jurisdictional legal authorities, universities 
and the profession.49
</p>
<p>The disconnection between, and confusion around, the respective roles 
of each phase of legal education and the place of clinic can be eased by 
greater &lsquo;clinic fluency&rsquo;. By this we mean the familiarity of people with 
the characteristics of clinical learning in law.50 Fluency involves a close 
familiarity with the range of clinical models available (see Chapter 3), 
the&nbsp;strengths and limits of each, and the value of integrating and sequencing 
the use of various clinical models in tandem with other teaching methods.51 
Such fluency enables understanding of the great potential of experiential 
learning, while also tempering unrealistic expectations around what can 
be achieved with only limited resources. It also entails an appreciation 
of the potential for insights from clinical legal education to inform the 
broader law curriculum.
</p>
<p>One of the distinctive contributions made by students having the 
opportunity to learn through supervised work with clients is the 
development of frameworks for personal reflection. Chapter 6 examines 
the learning opportunities generated by supervision arrangements that

(Legal Profession Uniform Law Application Act 2014, Schedule 1, cl 49), the requirement is two years 
if practical legal training is undertaken, or 18 months if a law firm traineeship is completed.

<p>systematically assist students to &lsquo;learn how to learn from experience&rsquo;.52 
These circumstances make it more important for both law schools and 
PLT providers to make informed choices about the design and delivery 
of experiential learning opportunities. The development of supervision 
arrangements that enable students and their supervisors to effectively 
harness the learning potential of practice experiences requires sustained 
engagement with the pedagogy of experiential learning. 
</p>
<p>These changes in legal education and legal practice in Australia have 
created serious and unresolved tensions around how to best prepare current 
students and recent graduates for the effective and ethical practice of law. 
As noted earlier, opportunities for law graduates to participate in a closely 
supervised transition to professional practice appear to have diminished.53 
At the very time that the importance of close supervision is being more 
clearly recognised, it is no longer uniformly available to law graduates. 
Some law graduates seek to enter the legal profession with little in the 
way of direct experience of legal work, and without structured support to 
assist them in making sense of the exposure to practice they have had. This 
has the potential to place greater expectations on clinics to play a&nbsp;more 
substantial role in the preparation of students for the practice&nbsp;of law. 
</p>
<p>Broader university agendas
Interest in clinics has been generated by a range of sector-wide 
developments in tertiary education. These include the growing emphasis 
on &lsquo;work-integrated learning&rsquo; and the importance attached to providing 
graduates with a capstone experience.54 Both of these trends are linked to 
developing graduate attributes and employability skills.55

53  Joe Cantanzariti, &lsquo;The Future of the National Legal Profession&rsquo;, Speech to the Opening of Law 
Summer School 2013, University of Western Australia, Perth, 22 February 2013. The emergence 
of larger national law firms and, over the past decade in particular, the internationalisation and 
digitisation of legal practice have further challenged the structures that have traditionally been used 
to prepare trainee and junior lawyers.

transition out of university into work and professional life. See Sally Kift, Des Butcher, Rachael Field,

<p>Work-integrated learning (WIL)
Within universities, efforts have been made to institutionalise WIL 
&lsquo;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teaching and learning approach which has the potential to provide 
a rich, active and contextualised learning experience for students which 
contributes to their engagement in learning&rsquo;.56 Orrell&rsquo;s 2011 Australian 
Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) Good Practice Report: Work 
Integrated Learning refers to WIL as &lsquo;a chameleon term with a problem 
of definition&rsquo;, describing programs involving student engagement with 
workplaces and communities as a formal part of their studies with the 
expectation of &lsquo;gaining new knowledge, understandings and capabilities, 
and mastering skills considered essential to particular workplace 
practices&rsquo;.57
</p>
<p>The 2008 report of the Bradley Review of Australian Higher Education, 
and the federal government&rsquo;s response to the report, both acknowledge 
the need for universities to prepare graduates for the world of work, 
increasing the interest of the sector in WIL as an educational approach.58 
While law as a discipline has not been central to this agenda,59 the setting 
of institutional goals is likely to increase pressure on law schools to make 
workplace learning opportunities readily available to their students.60 
Clinics appear to be seen by law schools as the easiest way to address such 
pressure despite their different orientation.
</p>
<p>As we have noted earlier, clinical legal education in Australia is distinctive 
in its focus on social justice concerns. Such concerns are more prominent 
in Australian clinical legal education than in WIL-related activities in other 
disciplines.61 In addressing equity, access and social justice in her Good 
Practice Report, Orrell&rsquo;s concern was with the participation of students 
rather than with the ethos of the programs.62 WIL programs also tend to 
be less structured, with limited focus on linking the experiential aspects

</p>
<p>to an academic component. Clinics need to be able to demonstrate the 
additional learning opportunities generated by a structured practice-based 
experience if they are to avoid being confused and conflated with WIL.
</p>
<p>Capstone experiences
Australian universities have shown increasing interest in developing so-
called &lsquo;capstone&rsquo; experiences for students as part of a broader agenda to 
develop graduate attributes. Capstone courses are generally completed in a 
student&rsquo;s final year or final semester. They have been defined as a crowning 
experience, &lsquo;with the specific objective of integrating a body of relatively 
fragmented knowledge in a unified whole&rsquo;. They enable undergraduate 
students to &lsquo;both look back over their undergraduate curriculum in an 
effort to make sense of that experience, and look forward to a life of 
building on that experience&rsquo;.63
</p>
<p>Clinical legal education has great potential to address the set of curriculum 
design principles identified by a Queensland University of Technology 
(QUT)-led project on capstone experiences in legal education.64 
The&nbsp;following principles were identified by the QUT project team:
</p>
<p>&bull; supporting transition by promoting self-management, developing 
professional identity and supporting career planning and development;
</p>
<p>&bull; providing integration and closure;
&bull; responding to diversity by enhancing students&rsquo; capacity to engage with 
</p>
<p>diversity in professional contexts;
&bull; promoting professional engagement;
&bull; recognising the experience&rsquo;s culminating nature by requiring students 
</p>
<p>to make appropriate use of feedback and to reflect on their own 
capabilities; and
</p>
<p>&bull; being regularly evaluated.65

</p>
<p>Clinical courses in a student&rsquo;s final year have often fulfilled many of 
these features. By default, many clinical elective courses are capstones. 
It&nbsp;remains to be seen whether clinical programs can be extended to enable 
all law students to engage in this type of capstone experience. Resource 
issues would present the most serious challenge to any such proposal.
</p>
<p>Learning and service
Recognition of the capacity for clinical legal education to serve multiple 
purposes generates the need to balance student learning and community 
service, as well as the legal professional responsibilities of clinic supervisors.66 
Similar challenges are also raised by other models of engagement such as 
service learning and pro bono work. 
</p>
<p>Service learning
Service learning has been identified by United States clinicians as having 
great potential to enhance the potential for law students to serve their 
communities. A United States review of the literature on service learning 
emphasises the importance of students being directly involved with 
the service users while engaging in classroom discussion and activities 
designed to foster reflection.67 Although it is not prominent in Australian 
higher education, service learning has been recognised as aligning with 
Deci and Ryan&rsquo;s self-determination theory that emphasises the basic 
human needs of autonomy, competence and relatedness.68 This theory 
is considered important in the developing literature on wellbeing in the 
legal profession, an issue we address later in this chapter. 
</p>
<p>Morin and Waysdorf have written about service learning as a form of 
experiential learning that involves responding to humanitarian crises, 
emphasising its focus on community service, with students receiving 
</p>
<p>66  Gavigan sums up this tension very effectively in her account of the Parkdale Clinic operated by 
Osgoode Hall Law School: &lsquo;Put most baldly, the unspeakable question has been: are law students &hellip; 
learning on the backs of the poor? Put more politely, the question was framed not infrequently as one 
of &ldquo;service vs. education&rdquo;.&rsquo; See Shelley Gavigan, &lsquo;Twenty-five Years of Dynamic Tension: The Parkdale 
Community Legal Services Experience&rsquo; (1997) 35(3) Osgoode Hall Law Journal 443, 457. See also

<p>little, if any, academic credit.69 They provide an account of a special 
service learning project involving students responding to needs generated 
by Hurricane Katrina in the United States. The project was service-
driven, while recognising the learning potential such work presents. 
Behre provides another interesting example involving student volunteers 
responding to legal needs generated by a tornado.70 The divide between 
service learning and clinical legal education appears to relate most 
particularly to the voluntary nature of student contributions, the limited 
classroom component, and the principal focus on service rather than 
student learning.71
</p>
<p>Pro bono
Clinics are often identified as important sites for fostering student 
commitment to making pro bono contributions.72 Evans has identified 
the interest of many clinicians in &lsquo;proving that a &ldquo;clinical experience&rdquo; in 
law school will direct law students towards public interest lawyering&rsquo;.73 
However, establishing such a link with hard data remains a challenge. 
Sandefur and Selbin have reported on the clinical legal education 
dimensions of the Beyond the JD Research Project, a national longitudinal 
study of early-career United States lawyers.74 They found &lsquo;surprisingly little 
empirical evidence about the relationship between clinical legal education 
and the practical and professional development of law students&rsquo;.75 Their 
data indicate that early-career lawyers value clinical experience more 
highly than any other aspect of the formal law school curriculum in 
preparing them to make the transition to the profession.76 However, their 
analysis addresses the contributions made by clinical experiences in a

</p>
<p>stand-alone sense; it would be interesting to consider whether additional 
contributions can be made through integration of clinical insights across 
the broader law curriculum.77
</p>
<p>Law student pro bono schemes have developed in Australia through 
the work of the National Pro Bono Resource Centre78 and Pro Bono 
Law Students Australia.79 Such schemes have the potential to provide 
pathways for valuable student contributions, provided they are effectively 
coordinated and resourced. In Chapter 6, we address issues related to the 
importance of effective supervision and structure in enabling students to 
maximise their learning from clinical experiences.80
</p>
<p>Wellness and depression in legal education 
and legal practice
Awareness of issues related to the mental health and wellbeing of law 
students has grown dramatically in the past decade. The work of the 
Tristan Jepson Memorial Foundation81 and the Wellness for Law Forum82 
in particular has been important in publicising the difficulties facing 
both law students and lawyers.83 The 2009 Courting the Blues project 
reported that 35 per cent of Australian law students recorded elevated 
levels of psychological distress as compared to 13 per cent of the general 
population. Almost 40 per cent of those students with high or very high 
levels of psychological distress reported distress severe enough to warrant 
medical or clinical intervention. The research concluded that the problem 
of &lsquo;law student distress&rsquo; was not confined to the United States.84
</p>
<p>77  While such contributions would be difficult to measure, Sandefur and Selbin refer to the 
Carnegie Report recommendations regarding a curriculum that integrates the cognitive, skills and 
civic dimensions of legal education. See Rebecca Sandefur and Jeffrey Selbin, cited at footnote 74, 70.

<p>A 2010 study of law students at The Australian National University 
(ANU)&nbsp; found that students entered law school with rates of 
wellbeing no lower than those among the general population but that 
levels of psychological distress rose significantly in first-year law.85 
Research involving students from Melbourne University Law School 
has subsequently produced findings consistent with those of the 
ANU&nbsp; study.86&nbsp; The&nbsp; Melbourne University Law School study has also 
questioned the extent to which these wellness issues are confined to legal 
education, suggesting the challenges may relate to higher education more 
generally.87

strategies to safeguard law students against depression and enhance their 
experience of law school.

<p>Larry Krieger is among the United States clinicians who are prominent 
in the therapeutic jurisprudence literature.89 Krieger&rsquo;s research, in 
collaboration with Kennon Sheldon, has emphasised the importance 
of promoting supported autonomy as part of efforts to overcome the 
&lsquo;corrosive effect&rsquo; of United States legal education on the &lsquo;well-being, 
motivation and values&rsquo; of law students.90 Krieger and Sheldon draw on 
Ryan and Deci&rsquo;s self-determination theory91 that explains the need people 
have for &lsquo;regular experiences of autonomy, competence, and relatedness to 
thrive and maximize their positive motivation&rsquo;.92 In the context of their 
longitudinal study of the wellbeing of United States lawyers, they identify 
a &lsquo;specific, cost-effective strategy&rsquo; for improving wellbeing as &lsquo;the provision 
of autonomy-supportive, rather than controlling, teaching, mentoring and 
work supervision&rsquo;.93 Clinic-based experiences, with their developmental 
focus and emphasis on supervision and collaboration, clearly have a 
valuable contribution to make to improving understanding of models of 
positive lawyering and reducing students&rsquo; levels of stress and anxiety.94 
</p>
<p>A final characteristic of the well-rounded law graduate, not just a clinical 
graduate, is the degree of their ethical sophistication. Law schools must 
teach ethics and professional responsibility, but the extent to which such 
courses penetrate students&rsquo; ethical consciousness is not well understood.95 
Arguably, almost no one emerges from an Australian law school with 
a&nbsp;real consciousness of ethical realities if they have not benefited from a 
clinic, but the truly resilient law graduate may be best developed through 
clinical experience of legal ethics, particularly that which exposes students 
to a thoroughly conceived ethics awareness program. Such programs can 
be summed up by the term ethical infrastructure; a concept that clinics are 
uniquely able to champion.

<p>Ethical infrastructure
Although the culture of a clinic tends to be visible in the &lsquo;atmosphere&rsquo; 
of&nbsp; the site after a short visit, there is a further intangible aspect 
to&nbsp; clinic that is harder to pin down but which is equally important to 
its reputation and sustainability. The ethical infrastructure, that is, the 
culture, attitudes and policies of the clinic to ethical practice, is critical to 
clinic sustainability and graduate resilience. We are not just talking about 
recognition of fiduciary obligations96 and minimising the risk of client 
complaints, although these are very important. More fundamentally, does 
the clinic as a whole understand, recognise and deal with the need for 
each of its supervisors to reconcile their views on the appropriate balance 
of the clinic between these duties to clients and the more important 
duty to the administration of justice? The contrast in approach reflects 
a similar discussion in Chapter&nbsp;5 below, concerning the technical skills 
versus law-in-context objectives of a clinical program. But the focus here 
is on legal&nbsp;ethics. 
</p>
<p>The debate is commonly summed up in the difference between zealous 
advocacy and responsible lawyering.97 To take one example, the zealous 
advocate who is presented with a police prosecutor who forgets to tell a 
magistrate about the very significant prior convictions of their client, will 
commonly feel quite justified in staying silent when it comes to sentencing 
the client for his assault on his wife. The result can be that a violent man with 
a history of violence is returned to his family. But the responsible lawyer may 
take the view that such silence is too big a risk to the safety of that woman 
and will speak up to ensure the court has full information before it makes 
a decision. The professional conduct rules do not necessarily assist, because 
they typically support either perspective, depending on the circumstances. 
Inside a clinic, if one supervising solicitor has a zealous advocate approach 
and instructs their student to stay silent in a plea should this situation 
occur, then another supervisor who hears of this and takes the protective 
responsible lawyering view will likely become very upset, if not angry. If 
these jurisprudential differences are simply allowed to continue and are 
not resolved then, in an extreme case such as this, the ethical infrastructure 
</p>
<p>96  Lawyers are &lsquo;fiduciaries&rsquo; (trustees) in the sense that clients place their trust and confidence 
in their lawyers to manage and protect property or money. This obligation is founded in equity, 
i.e.&nbsp;separate to any obligations under the lawyer&ndash;client retainer.

<p>of the clinic will be compromised over time and the clinic grapevine will 
ensure that everyone knows. Students may begin to doubt the integrity of 
the learning process and, eventually, referring agencies, other practitioners 
and the law school will get to hear of the problems. 
</p>
<p>It is common in all legal practices for different views to be held as to the 
priority between these two perspectives, but they are particularly difficult 
in clinics because there tends to be a wider range of views than typically 
occurs in private legal practices. In addition to the primary divide between 
zealous advocacy and responsible lawyering, there are two other common 
categories of ethical preference that tend to resonate strongly for clinic 
supervisors: moral activism and the relationship of care. Moral activists 
tend to be public interest lawyers concerned to achieve substantive justice 
and law reform. They are more commonly found in the community legal 
centres that host clinics than in other legal practice settings; they may not 
think it is a lawyer&rsquo;s role to automatically support the adversarial justice 
system and will be content to apply whichever of zealous advocacy or 
responsible lawyering is necessary to achieve their goals as law reformers. 
On the other hand, lawyers who see the relationship of care as dominant 
(they are often family lawyers or those involved in the child welfare system) 
take a moral dialogue approach and consider the social and political role 
of lawyers to be irrelevant. They see their primary obligation as ensuring 
that their client(s), their colleagues, their family and even themselves, 
survive the legal system and legal practice. 
</p>
<p>Students need to recognise their clinic values in this four-part framework 
and, after a while, be able to identify their own preferences. Ideally, their 
exposure to this categorisation will be taught with coherence across the 
clinic. The clinic ought not just leave it to the law school&rsquo;s ethics classes. 
On the whole, these are still instructional in tone and too driven by 
adherence to a view that cases and conduct rules provide all that is needed 
to found good legal ethics. 
</p>
<p>To address again the question of resilience, the clinic needs to go back a 
step or two and accept the proposition that it, as an entity, needs to work 
through its fundamental values and ethical preferences. Obviously, this 
has to be done in the context of the whole of the clinical program, but 
there are several stages: </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>&bull; Identifying and strengthening personal values among clinicians and 
students.98
</p>
<p>&bull; Accepting that there is such a thing as a corporate moral identity and 
that the clinic, just as a good law practice, needs to know what that 
identity is.
</p>
<p>&bull; Assessing whether the law school&rsquo;s dominant legal theory position, 
which is likely&mdash;but not always&mdash;to be generally positivist or 
associated with a &lsquo;thin&rsquo; rule of law99 is consistent with the directions 
set for students having regard to the clinic&rsquo;s moral identity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Setting down the clinic&rsquo;s views on its moral identity100 in an accessible 
location. In the context of the discussion above about a court&rsquo;s 
awareness of a defendant&rsquo;s prior family violence, is it a clinic that 
believes always in getting the best result for each client regardless of the 
methods used (consequentialism), or does it, as an entity, think that the 
means to the end (that is, notions of fairness) are at least as important 
as the outcome and do not justify misleading the court about prior 
violence (Kantianism)? Or is there among the supervisors a significant 
discomfort with both these moral identities and a considered view that 
the strengthened character of each clinical supervisor is the best way to 
ensure moral behaviour in representing clients (virtue ethics)?101
</p>
<p>&bull; Identifying students&rsquo; preferences for different lawyering types&mdash;in 
particular, dealing with the impact of the usually dominant zealous 
advocacy versus other lawyering models, recognising that all of these 
preferences are valid in certain contexts and that the key issue is to 
help individual students/supervisors understand their preferences with 
accessible scale tests,102 in the context of the moral identity of the clinic 
and the wider clinical program.

<p>Only after all of this work occurs can a clinic be said to have developed 
its ethical infrastructure, cemented its longer-term sustainability and 
contributed significantly to the growth of resilient legal professionals.
</p>
<p>Clinical scholarship
Heavy teaching and service responsibilities have often made it challenging 
for clinicians to prioritise research scholarship in the way some other 
legal academics do. Chavkin used the image of Rumpelstiltskin spinning 
straw into gold when characterising the challenge for clinicians, facing 
expectations of a &lsquo;generally hostile academic community&rsquo; to take on 
escalating teaching demands while also dealing with &lsquo;increasing collateral 
demands to participate in governance; to be the visible presence of the law 
school in the external legal community; and to produce scholarship&rsquo;.103 
In Australia, as we noted above, much work remains to be done to foster 
clinic fluency within law schools. 
</p>
<p>The longstanding issue of managing these expectations has now become 
an imperative as those clinicians who are employed as academics are 
expected to improve both the quality and quantity of their research. 
There is little prospect that these expectations, faced by all academics, will 
moderate. Clinicians also face challenges regarding the merit and scope 
of their scholarship.104 The &lsquo;odd one out&rsquo; nature of clinical scholarship&mdash;
&lsquo;writing outside mainstream legal disciplinary boundaries&rsquo;&mdash;has seen such 
scholarship described as difficult to evaluate.105 Clinicians also face unique

professor&rsquo;s academic freedom and professional responsibility to clients 
and the law school&rsquo;s decision-making authority&rsquo;.106 
</p>
<p>On the positive side, many clinicians have the capacity to contribute 
to multidisciplinary research as well as to research with the practising 
profession. Practice-related research may foster the further development of 
clinical programs, especially as universities intensify their research focus. 
In their analysis of the merit and potential of clinical scholarship, Gold 
and Plowden refer to the insular nature of much clinical scholarship and 
call for greater recognition of the shared nature of many of the concerns 
of the global clinical community.107 They do not make a case for broader 
law-related research collaboration, let alone cross-disciplinary research. 
Grimes states: &lsquo;The client base provides a ready resource for legal research 
and socio-legal study, and generates related legal research, policy and 
reform initiatives.&rsquo;108 
</p>
<p>As well, clinicians can contribute expertise related to client-centred models 
of legal practice, litigation processes, alternative dispute resolution and 
access to justice, emphasising the strengths and limitations of problem-
solving approaches. Clinicians can also contribute to research projects 
involving academic colleagues, especially in areas well represented in 
clinical casework. For example, human rights, environmental law, family 
law, criminal law, migration law, discrimination law and alternative 
dispute resolution.
</p>
<p>Conclusion
The importance of experiential education in law is being recognised 
in many countries.109 Clinics have real potential to advance multiple 
objectives related to student learning, community service, professional 
engagement, research and policy development.110 They also have a

<p>distinctive capacity to provide a bridge between different groups interested 
in legal education&mdash;linking both law schools and law students to the 
practising profession, judiciary and government as well as connecting law 
schools with their local communities.111
</p>
<p>Clinics face uncertain times, but it should be remembered that it was also 
in turbulent times that clinics emerged.112 Clinics are now more broadly 
recognised and better understood by their law schools, but still have a long 
road to travel. The expectations placed on clinical programs by students, 
universities, regulators and the practising legal profession appear likely to 
continue to grow. Clinicians need to respond effectively to calls for them 
to offer intensive, morally accountable and constructive clinic experiences 
to increasing numbers of students. 
</p>
<p>This mixture of factors and expectations has led to a lack of effective 
arrangements to assist Australian LLB, JD and PLT students and junior 
lawyers undertaking supervised legal practice to make the best use of 
experiential learning opportunities. Clinical legal education has an 
important contribution to make in responding to this dilemma. Clinics 
provide important opportunities for linking law student learning to 
notions of professionalism. Few learning opportunities can be as powerful 
and immediate as collaborating with a skilful, ethical supervisor-
practitioner, to advise and assist clients. 
</p>
<p>The greater use of clinical teaching methods in Australian law schools is 
yet to be matched by a strong understanding of the pedagogical choices 
required to make the most of this powerful teaching method. This lack of 
strong engagement with the pedagogy of clinical legal education was one 
catalyst for the Best Practices project, the results of which underpin much 
of this book.

Australian clinical legal education: 
</p>
<p>Models&nbsp;and&nbsp;definitions
</p>
<p>Introduction
The term clinical legal education means different things to academics, 
legal&nbsp;practitioners and students. In our survey results for Best Practices, 
the data illustrate the variety of forms and models encompassed within 
this term. In particular, it is apparent that newer clinical legal education 
programs are often quite different from the community legal centre-based 
real client clinics developed in the 1970s and 1980s (see Chapter 5). 
To&nbsp;ground the process of formulating best practices in Australian clinical 
legal education and make the best practices as meaningful as possible 
across a range of endeavours, it was necessary when conducting the 
research to clearly define our nomenclature.
</p>
<p>This is not a straightforward process. The definition of clinical legal 
education has been and remains contested. This is reflected in the 
different views expressed within the research group and more broadly 
in the international and domestic clinical community. The variety 
of clinical legal education endeavours across Australia indicates it is 
a&nbsp;dynamic pedagogy. New forms of clinical legal education continue to 
be developed, especially in relation to work-placement-type programs 
(called&nbsp; externships, internships or placements).1 Additionally, there is a 
growing recognition that clinical legal education ideally occurs at all stages 
</p>
<p>1  For elaboration of these terms, see the section commencing at &lsquo;Terminology&rsquo;, in this chapter.</p>

</p>
<p>of a law degree and is integrated.2 These factors warranted delineation 
between approaches while recognising that the categories are malleable. 
The categories of different forms of clinical legal education are based on 
the surveys we conducted and are relevant for the current Australian legal 
education environment. 
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we discuss and clarify key terms. We then focus on 
describing the emerging models of clinical legal education in Australia. 
We identify the merits of each model, and conclude by discussing the 
factors relevant to the choice of model. In discussing the merits of each 
model, we recognise that these are subjective considerations and can vary 
depending on the course goals, and on an individual&rsquo;s role within legal 
education as a full-time clinician, a traditional law academic, or a student. 
</p>
<p>What is clinical legal education?
A preliminary question is: what is clinical legal education? Put at its 
simplest, it is one method of learning and teaching law. However, the 
phrase has evolved in Australia over the last few decades and has different 
connotations.3 In order to differentiate clinical legal education from 
simulated practical legal training, Campbell wrote in 1991 that the 
&lsquo;term &ldquo;clinical legal education&rdquo; should properly be used only to refer to 
programs where students act for real clients in the handling of their real 
legal problems&rsquo;.4 In 1999 Giddings commented that:
</p>
<p>[the] term clinical legal education has been used quite loosely in 
Australia&nbsp;&hellip; Students and practising lawyers tend to relate clinical legal 
education to work with real clients or to &lsquo;skills&rsquo; &hellip; Other law teachers 
usually give clinical legal education a broader meaning, focusing on the 
use of teaching methods other than traditional lectures and seminars.5

</p>
<p>In the last two decades, clinical legal education has developed to 
encompass a variety of approaches, with the common element being &lsquo;real&rsquo; 
experiences. Clinical legal education is a pedagogy that places students in 
real-life environments. It is a form of experiential learning where students 
learn by doing and then reflecting.6 Experiential legal education takes 
many forms, including problem-solving, role plays, mooting, simulation 
and placements. Generally, experiential learning encompasses clinical 
legal education. It includes teaching about skills as well as the broader 
legal system. For students to get the most out of experiential learning 
there should also be feedback, reflection and application of new skills 
and&nbsp;ideas.7  
</p>
<p>In Australia, &lsquo;clinical legal education&rsquo; generally refers to law school 
experiential learning that places students in the role of lawyers representing 
clients with legal questions or problems. The research data for Best Practices 
reveal a range of experiential learning, from clinical components in law 
courses, to externships in a wide variety of organisations, and to intensive 
live client experiences within a university-controlled legal practice. 
This&nbsp;last example usually involves students working with clients on their 
legal issues, under the direct supervision of academic staff. 
</p>
<p>Clinical legal education confronts law students with the realities, demands 
and compromises of legal practice. In so doing, it provides students with 
real-life reference points for learning the law. Clinical legal education also 
invites students to see the wider context and everyday realities of accessing 
an imperfect legal system, enabling them to integrate their learning of 
substantive law with the justice implications of its practical operation.8
</p>
<p>Clinical legal pedagogy involves a system of reflection, self-critique and 
supervisory feedback (discussed in Chapters 6 and 7) by which law 
students learn how to learn from their experiences and observation and, 
at its most effective level, how to take personal responsibility for clients 
and their legal problems.

</p>
<p>Clinical legal education is normally intensive, one-on-one or small group 
in nature, and allows students to apply legal theory and develop lawyering 
skills to solve client legal problems. It relies on structured reflection to 
enable students to analyse the learning and insights they gain from their 
course. Favourable staff&ndash;student ratios (discussed in Chapter 9) and 
collaborative learning environments support a climate in which each 
student is motivated to improve and perform at their best. The personal 
responsibility of working with and being accountable to clients motivates 
students to perform to the best of their ability.9
</p>
<p>With all the clinics, a key benefit is that students are responsible either 
for a client file or for a specific legal task such as research. &lsquo;The learning is 
deeper and more meaningful when a student is participating as a lawyer, 
rather than as an observer or assistant.&rsquo;10 Law students&rsquo; legal work under 
supervision may include analysing client problems and giving legal advice; 
meeting with clients and witnesses to gather information; reviewing 
and preparing legal documents, such as contracts, wills, or legal briefs; 
negotiating with opposing parties or their lawyers; representing clients in 
administrative hearings, in court or before other tribunals in which the 
students have been granted a case-specific right of audience or the right to 
appear on behalf of a client; fact investigation; legal research for policy or 
law reform; and developing materials for community legal education and 
presenting a legal seminar.11
</p>
<p>Working in a clinic is frequently the first time that students encounter 
clients who have been treated unfairly through the legal system. They 
have to communicate with them and form a professional relationship 
with these clients. This can cause them to question their own role as 
prospective lawyers and their role in providing access to justice for clients 
and improving the law and legal system to make it more just.

<p>Clinical legal education might be considered a specific example of service 
learning. As we discussed in Chapter 2, service learning is a form of 
experiential learning that involves responding to humanitarian crises 
and focusing on community service, with students receiving little, if&nbsp;any, 
academic credit. Service learning is being actively promoted in a&nbsp;number

<p>of Australian universities and, as we pointed out, there is overlap between 
service learning and clinical legal education with differences in the voluntary 
nature of student contributions, the limited classroom component and the 
principal focus on service rather than student learning.12 We also pointed 
out in Chapter 2 that clinical legal education is similar to practical legal 
training (PLT) courses13 and work-integrated learning (WIL),14 but that 
it is distinct in several respects. Both these approaches expose students to 
practical aspects of legal workplaces. Each approach also reinforces for 
students that a knowledge of legal theory is insufficient for legal practice 
and that their &lsquo;law school&rsquo; impressions of what it is like to actually practise 
law will be expanded by time and a variety of experiences.15
</p>
<p>An essential difference between clinical legal education and either PLT 
or WIL is that clinical legal education is an approach to integrating and 
strengthening the academic phase of legal education in the interests 
of students and clients. As we noted in Chapter 2, the emphasis in 
clinical legal&nbsp; education on meeting the diverse and complex needs 
(legal,&nbsp; emotional, systemic and therapeutic) of real clients, either 
individuals or organisations, places it well beyond the vocational focus 
of PLT and WIL, which can limit themselves to a &lsquo;how to&rsquo; approach to 
practising law. Clinical legal education avoids any default concentration 
on apparently value-neutral practical skills (see Chapter 5) and is intended 
to develop a critical and analytical consciousness of law.16

</p>
<p>Similarly, clinical legal education is distinct from pro bono publico 
and student-run volunteer programs.17 Such placements have limited 
educational objectives compared to clinical legal education, do not 
generally seek to develop students&rsquo; normative awareness and do not set out 
to strengthen wider legal education and law reform curricula, although 
both can awaken and sustain graduates&rsquo; civic consciousness once they are 
in practice.18
</p>
<p>The role of simulations
The inclusion of simulated legal practice in the definition of clinical legal 
education is controversial. Students acting &lsquo;for real clients in the handling 
of their real legal problems&rsquo; has been a point of differentiation from 
other forms of legal education and practical legal training for Australian 
clinicians. As Campbell illustrates above, Australian clinical legal 
education proponents have emphasised the &lsquo;real client&rsquo; aspect of clinical 
legal education and purposefully excluded simulations from the definition 
(particularly to differentiate them from PLT programs).19 In discussing 
our research for Best Practices, we found that we held different views on the 
status of simulation in the definition of clinical legal education but agreed 
on its importance in preparing students for the &lsquo;real client&rsquo; experience.20 
</p>
<p>We agree on the value of simulations as a means of teaching students 
specific skills, such as negotiation or interviewing specifically in 
preparation for actual negotiation or interviewing, or generally doing 
legal work. Simulations are a form of experiential education; but we could 
not agree that student engagement in simulated legal practice be included 
in the definition of clinical legal education.

<p>Understanding clinical legal education as a continuum in which simulations 
provide a valuable source of experience and learning for students provides 
a means of progressing the discussion.21 Both simulations and &lsquo;real client&rsquo; 
courses are valuable as a means of achieving specific learning goals with 
students. The ideal approach is an integrated one.22
</p>
<p>An integrative approach to clinical legal education involves the use of 
simulations and case studies to prepare students for the responsibility 
of working with clients on real cases. It also involves drawing on real 
client experiences to inform the non-clinical law curriculum.23 Students 
can best develop ethical awareness, judgment and proficiency in the 
application of professional skills through having &lsquo;repeated opportunities 
to perform the tasks to be learned or improved upon until they reach 
the desired level of proficiency&rsquo;.24 Clinical teaching methods and insights 
can be constructively integrated into classroom-based courses. Integration 
emphasises the client focus so important to both clinic-based learning and 
legal practice. The law and legal processes can be examined, analysed and 
critiqued within the framework of client concerns and interests. Short 
field placements can provide a primer for more intense clinical experiences 
later in a law program. The use of complementary clinical experiences, or 
components, in doctrinal courses enables students to acquire additional 
skills and enhance their understanding of the law as practised.25 Integrative 
approaches will be most effective if they culminate in real client work 
enabling students to learn about the uncertain, dynamic nature of law-
related professional practice.

<p>In a law degree, students would initially have simulated experiences and 
they use these as building blocks, or as a means to help them structure or 
scaffold their learning. This enables them to confidently and competently 
provide legal services to &lsquo;real clients&rsquo; in a live client clinic or externship. 
Real clients have unexpected, unscripted issues and ways of dealing with 
legal problems and the &lsquo;real client&rsquo; clinic provides a unique and rich 
learning environment for students. Clinicians recognise the importance 
of preparing students for real client interactions through simulations and, 
while some choose to include this within the definition of clinical legal 
education, others do not.

<p>Distinguishing features of clinical legal 
education in Australia 
In Australia, clinical legal education was established with dual goals: 
community service and educating law students.26 A focus on access to 
justice and the need in the community for legal services triggered the early 
initiatives in clinical legal education.27 Arising out of this, the connection 
between clinical legal education and Australian community legal centres 
has developed strongly, as we describe in detail in Chapter 5.28 
</p>
<p>Our research for Best Practices revealed a number of clear trends in 
Australian clinical legal education, among which are that: 
</p>
<p>&bull; Australian clinical legal education still has a strong focus on service to 
the community; 
</p>
<p>&bull; within the curriculum of a clinical legal education course there is 
usually discussion of law in context; 
</p>
<p>&bull; students are engaged in a wide range of legal activities including 
individual case work, law reform, legal research and community legal 
education;

</p>
<p>&bull; most clinical legal education is located in not-for- profit organisations, 
community legal centres and legal aid organisations; and 
</p>
<p>&bull; there is a significant growth in the number of work-placement-type 
programs (called externships or internships) across the country.29
</p>
<p>Terminology
The data obtained from our Best Practices survey show a significant diversity 
of clinical legal education programs. It is apparent from the diversity that, 
in order to develop best practices in Australia, clarity around terms and 
a delineation of different models of clinical legal education are necessary. 
</p>
<p>What is &lsquo;clinic&rsquo;?
In our experience, the word &lsquo;clinic&rsquo; is used loosely and is often used to 
describe the actual site of the clinical legal education program, the legal 
practice or the clinical legal education course undertaken by students. 
Things happen &lsquo;at the clinic&rsquo; or &lsquo;in the clinic&rsquo;. The &lsquo;clinic&rsquo; often refers to 
the physical legal practice or agency where students are undertaking their 
clinical legal education, and the simple word &lsquo;clinic&rsquo; often refers to the 
clinical course.
</p>
<p>What is a &lsquo;client&rsquo;?
The variety of work performed in clinical legal education programs 
in Australia ranges across individual legal advice and representation, 
community legal education, policy and law reform work.30 As a result, 
there are several meanings of &lsquo;client&rsquo;. Doing &lsquo;legal work for the client&rsquo; 
covers&nbsp; more than just legal work for individuals. The expression 
&lsquo;the&nbsp;client&rsquo;&nbsp;can refer to one or more of: 
</p>
<p>&bull; an individual (as a client of a live client clinic); 
&bull; groups of individuals with common interests or concerns; 
&bull; an organisation or group of organisations;

</p>
<p>&bull; a community (the client of a law reform or community development 
clinic or component within a clinical course); and 
</p>
<p>&bull; the general beneficiaries of law reform or impact litigation.31
</p>
<p>Models
Best Practices describes five models of clinical legal education,32 
developed from the survey data detailed in the Regional Reports and 
the distinguishing features of Australian clinical legal education outlined 
above.&nbsp; We&nbsp; acknowledge that other clinicians (especially from other 
countries and contexts) might prefer different models and criteria; 
however, we drew on our empirical data and our collective experience. 
With substantial diversity in the Australian clinical legal education 
environment, the identification of models is fraught. None is a discrete 
entity; there can be and is overlap. The models should be seen as 
a&nbsp; continuum and as complementary and, depending on the objectives 
of a course, there is significant scope for variations and hybrids of these 
clinical legal education models.33 Our approach to categorisation focuses 
primarily on location and control of the learning environment.
</p>
<p>In Best Practices we identified five models: 
</p>
<p>&bull; in-house live client clinic;
&bull; in-house live client clinic (some external funding);
&bull; external live client clinic (agency clinic);
&bull; externships (including internships and placements); and
&bull; clinical components in other courses.34
</p>
<p>In in-house live client clinical courses, law students work closely under 
the supervision of law school staff to provide legal assistance to clients 
or perform other legal tasks such as drafting law reform submissions, 
analysing legislation, mediating disputes, community legal education or 
other work done by lawyers. In external live client clinic (agency clinic), 
students work under the joint supervision of law school staff and agency 
staff. In externship courses, law students are placed in professional legal 
settings outside the law school where they work on real legal matters and

</p>
<p>are primarily supervised by lawyers who are not law school staff. In all the 
above models, there is usually a classroom component in addition to the 
placement. In courses with clinical components, students assume lawyer 
roles in working with real clients, such as interviewing clients, drafting 
law reform submissions or other &lsquo;real&rsquo; activities.
</p>
<p>We recognise there may be other ways to classify clinical legal education 
models. There could also be a number of subcategories within the five 
models we have proposed. For example, a discussion about the legal 
aid origins of clinical legal education noted that legal aid&ndash;oriented law 
school clinics typically fall into one of three categories: the individual 
service model, a specialisation model or a community model.35 Another 
approach to categorising focuses on the extent of legal representation the 
clinic engages in: full representation, partial representation, community 
lawyering orientation or community legal education (sometimes also 
called &lsquo;Street Law&rsquo;).36 In the Australian context, especially in community 
legal centres where many clinical programs are based, the range of work 
can include all these aspects. Accordingly this categorisation would not 
be useful. The features of a clinic may change over time due to variations 
in funding, support from the university, withdrawal of host organisations 
and staffing issues. As well, some clinical legal education programs 
may combine a number of different models. At La Trobe and Griffith 
universities and the University of New South Wales, for example, there 
are live client clinics as well as externships and clinical legal education 
components.37
</p>
<p>Another approach would classify clinics according to whether the law 
school or some other body has formal (legal) responsibility for client work 
and student supervision. This apparently straightforward subdivision 
would mean that there are just two types of clinics: those that the law school

</p>
<p>controls and those that it does not. However, this strict categorisation is 
not realistic or sufficiently subtle in the Australian context where many 
clinical programs are built on a partnership model with the legal services 
provider/agency. Specifically in our external live client clinic (agency 
clinic), the legal work may be the ultimate responsibility of the agency 
but law school staff act as supervisors and legal practitioners. They are 
formally responsible for student supervision. Additionally, it can never be 
said that an externship has full responsibility for student supervision. A law 
school never relinquishes its final say on the mark or credit that a student 
receives&nbsp;for the overall clinical course. The law school can therefore never 
fully divest itself of supervision in favor of an external agency. Therefore 
this classification is not helpful in the Australian context.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we combine discussion of the models &lsquo;in-house live client 
clinic&rsquo; and &lsquo;in-house live client clinic (some external funding)&rsquo;. Keeping 
in mind our categorisation criteria of location and control of the learning 
environment, these two categories of clinic are fundamentally the same. 
The distinguishing feature is the funding source and this can vary from 
year to year. Other aspects of the models are similar so, to avoid repetition, 
the discussion is amalgamated.
</p>
<p>In-house live client
&lsquo;In-house live client clinics&rsquo; are defined as being &lsquo;on campus, wholly 
or substantially funded and controlled by the law school for student 
education&rsquo;. This is the dominant clinical program model in the United 
States. In this model, clinics may receive some external funding, as do 
the clinics at Kingsford Legal Centre, University of New South Wales 
(UNSW), or may not receive external funding, as at the Newcastle 
University Legal Centre.38
</p>
<p>The oldest example of an in-house live client clinic without external 
funding in Australia is the Newcastle University Legal Centre. The 
clinic is situated on a city campus of the university and is dedicated to 
an integrated version of clinical legal education: students are offered the

</p>
<p>opportunity to be introduced to clinical legal education in their first year 
of study and, throughout their degree, students have further opportunities 
to study in the clinic.39
</p>
<p>In 2011, the University of South Australia opened its in-house clinic 
wholly funded by the law school. At the time of our Best Practices survey, 
the University of South Australia Legal Advice clinic was physically 
situated within the law school. More recently, this clinic has received 
funding from external sources and now also provides services at various 
outreach locations.40
</p>
<p>A key benefit of a wholly law school&ndash;controlled clinic is the substantial 
control of the clinical teaching. While an in-house live client clinic has 
additional functions, such as providing a legal service to students or the 
community, one of its primary goals is to teach students. The course goals 
determine the specific learning objectives for the program.
</p>
<p>These joint aims, to provide both student learning and client service, can 
create a tension. However, to date, the Australian experience is that both 
aims can be accommodated.41
</p>
<p>For example, in the Employment Law clinic at Kingsford Legal Centre, 
UNSW, students sometimes represent clients in conciliation hearings42 
at Fair Work Australia when clients are claiming they have been unfairly 
dismissed. While it could be argued that a client would be better represented 
by a lawyer, the level of representation is relatively high as students prepare 
thoroughly for their conciliation hearings and, in the process, they learn 
about interviewing clients, negotiation skills and dealing with informal 
tribunals. The student is accompanied in the conciliation hearing so that 
a clinical supervisor can contribute if there is a need for it, to ensure that a 
client&rsquo;s interests are not compromised. This example shows the balancing 
of both student learning goals and client interests being met together.

<p>Analysis
There is a high degree of control by a faculty of law over an in-house 
clinical course. This means that the course can be specifically tailored to 
suit the learning goals in a course at any time and provides a level of 
flexibility to the faculty. As stated in the South Australian Regional Report, 
&lsquo;because our clinic is here within the cocoon of the law school we can 
control and look after them and keep tabs on them&rsquo;.43 In contrast, in an 
external live client clinic (agency clinic), for example, a student&rsquo;s learning 
has to be negotiated in the context of the external agency&rsquo;s priorities. 
</p>
<p>There is a range of approaches within in-house clinical courses. In some, 
the students&rsquo; learning is paramount: &lsquo;A clinic is designed for a student 
experience. A community legal centre or a firm or any organisation has 
not been designed for the volunteers who come in.&rsquo;44 For some in-house 
clinics the focus is the students, and this clear prioritising means specific 
learning goals can be set and worked towards clearly. In others that are also 
community legal centres, there will be a shifting balance with constant 
attention on both student learning goals and client service.45 
</p>
<p>A benefit of this model, referred to in the Regional Reports, is that trained 
and experienced educators work with students. Clinical supervisors have 
experience teaching a range of diverse students. A core part of a clinician&rsquo;s 
job is to teach students. The in-house live client clinic has the advantage 
of being specifically established to teach students. There can be a strong 
and well-articulated link between practice experience and reflection. 
Another benefit referred to in the Regional Reports by interviewees is 
that students in in-house clinical courses are more likely to be given more 
responsibility.46 Supervisors are accustomed to working with students in 
a supportive way to enable them to increasingly take more responsibility 
throughout a semester. In contrast, supervisors in an externship may feel 
less comfortable with giving students responsibility, even if they have 
formal (legal) authority to do so.

</p>
<p>Another benefit of in-house live client clinics is the shared facilities and 
infrastructure, which offer some costs savings.47 For example, the university 
may absorb some of the financial responsibilities for the clinical program, 
or provide human resources support to clinical staff, as discussed further 
in Chapter 9. 
</p>
<p>Another positive aspect of the in-house clinic is the more obvious 
integration of the clinical course within the law faculty. Clinics have 
sometimes been on the periphery of law teaching, but a clinic that is 
physically located within the law school gives the implicit message that it 
is an essential part of the law school&rsquo;s function, and provides a constant 
reminder of the connection of learning law with the practice of law. 
A&nbsp;further benefit of this model is that it is physically easy for students to 
gain access as the clinic is located where they study.
</p>
<p>One of the disadvantages of an in-house clinic is that it can present 
a&nbsp;model of legal practice that a student is unlikely to encounter when they 
enter legal practice. Demand may be limited and the client numbers can 
usually be tightly controlled in order to ensure the educational experience. 
Students may gain the impression that they have unlimited time to devote 
to one particular case. In fact, one of the skills of legal practice is being 
able to allocate sufficient time to each client file, juggling the competing 
needs of clients, co-workers and other work priorities. If work is highly 
controlled, as it is more likely to be in an in-house live client clinic, then 
the hectic pace of legal practice is less likely to be found.
</p>
<p>If an in-house clinic is the only model of clinic offered by a university, 
then our research for Best Practices shows that is more likely to be a&nbsp;clinic 
that provides legal services to disadvantaged clients.48 An in-house 
clinic that is also serving the community is more likely to offer students

student interest. While many students are keen to learn about law in this

48  This does not have to be the case, but if a law faculty is going to fund a legal practice for the 
purpose of teaching students, then this expense is more likely to be justified if it also fulfils the goals of 
community engagement. There are no examples of in-house clinics that do not provide legal services 
to either students or disadvantaged communities: see Identifying Current Practices in Clinical Legal 
Education, Regional Reports, cited in Chapter 1 at footnote 6.</p>

<p>environment, some may prefer to learn about other ways of practising law. 
Providing externships in a range of locations meets the needs of a greater 
variety of students. 
</p>
<p>One of the main disadvantages of in-house live client clinics is the cost 
of the model. In the current climate of constrained budgets, law schools 
are looking to expend their clinical programs in a cost-effective way. 
Establishing relatively expensive in-house live client clinics is not likely 
to be a growth area.
</p>
<p>External live client clinic (agency clinics)
The distinguishing features of this model are that students are placed at 
an agency over which the university has limited control, often the subject 
of a memorandum of understanding, and a law school academic/legal 
practitioner provides the supervision of students onsite in the organisation. 
The model relies on a significant level of partnership and collaboration 
between the university and the agency. Longstanding clinical programs 
at La Trobe, Griffith, Monash and Murdoch universities and at ANU are 
external live client clinics.49 The funding arrangements and the level of 
involvement in these clinics vary among the programs. One common 
and distinguishing aspect of this model is the involvement of law school 
staff onsite at the agency (away from the campus). Other agency staff 
are also often involved in the supervision of students, both formally and 
informally. In this type of clinic, supervisory control of students is a shared 
enterprise between the law school and the agency.
</p>
<p>Analysis
In an agency clinic, students benefit from exposure to the realities of 
working in agencies like community legal centres. They experience the 
high levels of client demand and need, the challenge of insufficient 
resources, and the commitment of agency staff. Especially in a larger 
organisation, like a legal aid commission, students and academic staff 
get the opportunity to work and engage with a diverse range of legal 
practitioners.

</p>
<p>In an agency clinic, the university will have limited responsibility for the 
running costs and infrastructure. The university will employ staff and 
often make a contribution to the agency, but the agency relies on external 
funding for the bulk of its support. Consequently, agency clinics are a less 
resource-intensive option for universities than in-house clinics.
</p>
<p>Partnerships with local community agencies enhance the universities&rsquo; 
community engagement profiles,50 and agency clinics offer a positive way 
for universities to make a contribution to their communities.
</p>
<p>Often, in agency clinics, the clinical legal education course operates only 
during university semesters, and the community agency is likely to take 
responsibility for any ongoing case commitments between semesters. 
Academics involved in such a program are likely to be able to focus on 
research and scholarship outside of semesters, as well as contribute to the 
teaching of other courses.51
</p>
<p>In an agency clinic, the law school will have little direct control over the 
work of the agency and its staff. Although agency clinics usually have a 
memorandum of understanding that sets out details of student involvement 
and areas of work, the educational aspect of a program is often viewed 
by the agency as secondary. A tension between service and education is 
highlighted in an agency clinic,52 so good working relationships between 
university staff and agency staff are therefore critical to the success of 
agency clinics. The maintenance of effective and productive relationships 
requires nurturing53 and is often time-consuming.
</p>
<p>As the university clinical staff are located at the agency clinic, they can 
become isolated from the law school. This can have implications both 
for the careers of the individuals involved and for the profile of clinical 
legal education within the university. At worst, the clinic and its staff can 
become marginalised. Time and energy is therefore needed to ensure the 
reputation and work of the clinical legal education program and its staff 
are recognised both by the law school and the broader university. This is 
an example of the same issue in all clinical models, as clinical teaching is 
distinct from traditional law teaching and frequently not understood by 
law faculties.

<p>Externships (including internships 
and placements)
Our Best Practices survey revealed that the most significant growth in 
clinical legal education was in externship programs, also sometimes 
described as internships or placements.54 From our research it is clear 
that these terms are used interchangeably and do not reflect substantial 
differences. In this book we use the word &lsquo;externships&rsquo; to describe the 
form of clinical legal education where individual students are placed in an 
independent legal practice, community legal centre, government agency 
or not-for-profit organisation.
</p>
<p>The distinguishing feature is that, unlike external live client clinics, everyday 
student supervision is the primary responsibility of the host organisation, 
although there may also be an academic supervisor who monitors the 
students&rsquo; work. This form of education is not unique to law schools and is 
common in many other disciplines.55 The pedagogy of externships is well 
developed in the United States.56 However, externships have often been 
seen as a lesser form of clinical legal education in Australia and elsewhere, 
because frequently they are not rigorously designed with clearly defined 
learning outcomes. It is more likely that there will be variable learning 
outcomes in externships because the supervision varies from workplace 
to workplace. As the teaching of students is not an essential part of the 
student supervisors&rsquo; role, there is a risk that student learning goals are of 
secondary importance to the functioning of the workplace.57
</p>
<p>There is significant variability in this lower-cost clinical legal education 
model. Most externships programs involve students working for a day 
a&nbsp;week during the semester at the host organisation. However, this can 
vary, so that students work intensively for two or three weeks, particularly 
if the placement is overseas or interstate. Ideally, externship programs

prompted the Fair Work Ombudsman (with Rosemary Owens) to initiate a research project: see

<p>include a seminar program (often fortnightly) and an opportunity for 
students to come together and discuss their individual experiences in the 
larger group. For example, at La Trobe University, students in the course 
Public Interest Law Practice attend a fortnightly seminar and supervision 
session on campus. This enables students to learn about other student 
experiences and provides a supportive environment in which to discuss 
any issues or concerns.
</p>
<p>Externship programs can be either generalist or specialist. For example, 
at Griffith Law School there is the Semester in Practice program; the 
University of Sydney offers an externship course focusing on social justice 
and at UNSW there are specialist externship programs (for example, the 
Hong Kong Refugee Law Clinic).58
</p>
<p>Although this model enables law schools to provide diverse learning sites 
in a cost-effective way, the actual standard of any externship program will 
be dependent on available resources and skilled, sensitive relationship 
management. Universities do not have to cover the infrastructure costs of 
an externship program, but quality externships require ongoing training 
of supervisors, committed academic staff involvement and maintenance 
of the interpersonal relationships between law school and agency. The true 
cost of a good externship program should not be underestimated.
</p>
<p>Analysis
The number of externship programs is increasing in Australian law schools 
because they are much less resource intensive than in-house clinic programs. 
They do not require establishing infrastructure and the clinical supervision 
is contracted out. The first Australian externship programs did not pay the 
host organisations for their participation in the programs. However, more 
recently, the establishment of some externship programs has involved the 
law schools paying the host organisations (often community legal centres) 
a fee.59 As Giddings notes, &lsquo;[t]he cost differential between externships

</p>
<p>and in-house clinics will be influenced by the resources the law school 
commits to supporting externship students&rsquo;,60 but that differential will 
narrow if a trend for paying for externships continues.
</p>
<p>The nature of the supervision arrangements in externships enables 
larger numbers of students to be given a clinical opportunity. 
For&nbsp;instance, Deakin&nbsp;Law School runs an externship program with over 
30&nbsp; partnerships.61&nbsp; This&nbsp; supervision aspect of externships also facilitates 
significant community engagement for the university. Externships also 
enable students based in regional campuses to participate in clinical 
legal education. Universities are less likely to establish in-house clinics 
in regional campuses where the number of students is fewer, although 
there may be opportunities to place students in local legal aid agencies, 
or to form partnerships with these organisations. In Bendigo, Victoria, 
La Trobe University offers an externship to second-year law students. 
This is beneficial for students&rsquo; future job prospects and the university&rsquo;s 
relationship with the local legal profession.62 
</p>
<p>Externships are well suited to facilitate learning that involves an 
assessment of aspects of the justice system other than just legal practice. 
This wider perspective is particularly true for students who are placed with 
magistrates or judges, law reform agencies and government departments. 
Equally, externships can enable students to pursue their preferred areas of 
legal practice.
</p>
<p>In the externship model, the law school has less control over the student 
learning experience as the supervision is primarily the responsibility of the 
host organisation. This delegation of supervisory responsibility by the law 
school to the host organisation may be formal under a memorandum of 
understanding, or informal. Ideally, the former will occur, but a complete 
delegation of responsibility is impossible where the student is receiving 
credit for their externship work. This is why we prefer to emphasise the 
collaborative reality of the supervisory environment rather than legal 
liability for supervision. Also, within a given clinical course, there is

</p>
<p>a&nbsp;likelihood of significant variability in the work students are engaged to 
perform across different placement sites.63 Accordingly, the overall quality 
and consistency of the externship program can be compromised.
</p>
<p>Given that many externship placements in Australia are in community 
legal&nbsp; centres&mdash;which are severely under-resourced organisations&mdash;
there is a risk that students will not receive appropriate levels of 
supervision. To&nbsp;counter these risks, supervisors should receive university-
funded training&nbsp; and a supervision manual, and liaise with relevant 
university&nbsp;academics.64 Another limitation of externships is that student 
responsibility for client work is reduced, because staff who are supervising 
students are accustomed to actually being responsible and performing 
the work themselves. Giving students responsibility for client files,65 law 
reform submissions or other legal work is challenging and a different way 
of working from that with which placement supervisors may be familiar.
</p>
<p>With the growing interest in developing externships, there is increased 
competition among law schools to obtain placements. A number of 
community legal centres in Queensland, for example, take students from 
a variety of law schools. With increased demand for placements and a 
static supply of placement sites, the need to obtain sufficient placement 
sites could mean less attention to the actual quality of the placement. 
However, increased competition among universities enables the host 
organisations to demand adequate resourcing from universities that could 
improve the quality.
</p>
<p>A recent variation on the externship model is the creation of &lsquo;virtual 
clinics&rsquo;. Utilising online communication, students work for an external 
organisation that is based overseas or interstate. The student remains 
in their local environment and works with the external organisation 
via online written, video or audio communication. They may have a 
designated supervisor in the external organisation and/or a supervisor in 
the home university. For instance, in the ANU course, The International 
Human Rights Clinic, students work with non-government organisations 
(NGOs) in the Pacific and Asian regions.66 Because of the globalisation of

<p>legal practice and the increasing use of online technology to deliver legal 
services, especially to remote and rural areas of Australia, this mode of 
clinical legal education offers significant potential.
</p>
<p>Clinical components in other courses 
In Best Practices we described a clinical component as occurring when 
a substantive law course includes within its teaching and assessment 
a&nbsp;section that is clinical.67 This can include interviewing clients and writing 
a reflective assignment,68 participating in judicial mentoring (for&nbsp;example, 
accompanying a magistrate or judge in order to understand their work 
as a part of courses in criminal procedure, evidence, and family law and 
policy),69 or working in a community legal centre for two weeks with a 
focus on family law.70
</p>
<p>In the New South Wales (NSW) and Australian Capital Territory 
(ACT) Regional Reports, interviewees reported that specific skills such 
as interviewing, research, case evaluation and negotiation could all 
be incorporated into doctrinal law courses.71 This is usually through a 
simulated approach to legal practice. For example, students may be asked 
to draft pleadings or conduct negotiations over specific scenarios.
</p>
<p>The Best Practices research asked about the merits of an integrated 
approach to legal education, combining simulation, doctrinal teaching, 
clinical components and clinics. There is a range of views about whether 
any integration needs to occur in a linear form. Many responded that all 
approaches are useful for different purposes. One of the comments from 
the Regional Reports was that exposure to clinical methodology through 
a clinical component in a doctrinal subject may be difficult in law schools 
that do not have in-house live clinics. Interviewees expressed the view

<p>that &lsquo;[i]t is not possible in the partnership external model&rsquo;.72 However, 
the&nbsp;approach taken by Charles Darwin University,73 based in Darwin in 
the Northern Territory but with a clinical component in Albury-Wodonga 
(NSW and Victorian border), almost 4,000 kilometres away, suggests 
otherwise. In this course, students spend two weeks on site in Albury-
Wodonga in a community legal centre family law practice where they 
learn client communication skills as well as substantive law.
</p>
<p>Analysis
A clinical component has the benefit of providing a large number 
of students with a short, sharp experience of legal work that, with a 
reflective component, can be very effective. For many students, a clinical 
component&nbsp; in a course will be their first experience of law in practice 
or of real clients. It can be an affirming experience for students who are 
questioning what role they may play in the legal system, and it can bring 
academic learning to life through real legal issues faced by ordinary people 
in the community.
</p>
<p>The logistics and administration required to provide large numbers of 
students with a clinical component is resource intensive. This can be 
taxing on the site where the clinical component is being provided74 and 
requires a high level of administration in the course. Students&rsquo; learning 
can be prioritised over client service75 through a clinical component as the 
student will generally have more limited skills than if they were doing an 
entire clinical course, since they are there for a brief experience only.

</p>
<p>Factors in choice of model
As discussed above, ideally, clinical legal education ought to be integrated 
throughout the law curriculum and a range of models will be used, 
including simulations, clinical components, externships, agency clinics 
and in-house clinics.76 Currently, most universities have not adopted 
this approach. The choice of a clinical legal education model depends 
on a&nbsp;range of factors.77 Although we discuss these factors discretely, they 
are not unrelated; each one affects another. The decision about which 
model of clinical legal education to adopt will be based on a combination 
of&nbsp;issues, including: 
</p>
<p>&bull; learning objectives of the course;
&bull; available resources, financial and physical; 
&bull; extent of control and supervision;
&bull; potential partnerships/placements; 
&bull; types of legal work; and 
&bull; students&rsquo; location and their numbers.
</p>
<p>Learning objectives 
The most important aspect of choosing a preferred model is matching the 
learning objectives of the course with the best model to facilitate those 
objectives.78 The various models of clinical legal education offer different 
learning opportunities to students. In Chapter 4, &lsquo;Course design for 
clinical teaching&rsquo;, we discuss these issues more fully. 
</p>
<p>Extent of control and supervision
One of the key aspects of high-quality clinical legal education is the 
standard of supervision:79 &lsquo;Close supervision is often described as a 
hallmark of clinical education.&rsquo;80 In any externship or external live client 
agency relationship, there is less control over the specific learning goals and

<p>3 . AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>supervision may not be as intensive.81 The advantages of these as options 
for clinical legal education are that they are generally less expensive to 
establish for law schools, and also provide greater diversity in placement 
sites for students. Weighing up the degree of control that the law school 
wants with the cost of providing in-house clinics will be part of the 
decision-making in choosing the model.82
</p>
<p>Available resources
Ideally, a staged approach, beginning with simulations and ending with 
a live client experience, enables students to scaffold their learning more 
effectively than in any other way. However, this is often seen as too 
resource intensive, and the choice of model is often limited by available 
funds. A law school will have to weigh up the specific educational 
objectives for students with the resources that are available. The resources 
needed to run a clinical legal education program include staff (academic, 
legal supervisors and administrative) and the costs of office infrastructure 
including information technology, rent, equipment and related expenses, 
which we discuss more fully in Chapter 9, &lsquo;Resourcing live client clinics&rsquo;. 
As discussed above, establishing an in-house live client clinic is the most 
resource-intensive form of clinical legal education.83 The benefits include 
the law school&rsquo;s ability to clearly shape and develop the educational 
experience it provides for its students with a high degree of control. 
</p>
<p>Potential partnerships/placements
Universities may have well-developed connections with the community 
and frequently see their role as reaching into and collaborating with 
the community. &lsquo;Community&rsquo; can include student communities, local 
communities, the legal profession, the judiciary, the general public and even 
specific groupings within the general public and government agencies.84 
Universities and law schools may want to develop these relationships and

<p>64
</p>
<p>collaborations at particular points in time. These will in turn influence 
the decision about where to situate a clinical legal education program and 
how to develop it. 
</p>
<p>Another factor in deciding whether to develop an externship program is 
the diversity and opportunities of placement sites that might be available. 
Not all clinical legal education courses need to have learning objectives 
related to community or social justice. Placement opportunities may 
arise that give students the chance to develop their skills and reflection 
in another type of legal practice, such as commercial or sports law, 
or&nbsp;even internationally. Externships offer this last benefit and flexibility,85 
permitting international clinical courses to be offered that may be 
attractive to students.86 
</p>
<p>Types of legal work
A further factor related to facilitating learning objectives and making the 
most of placement opportunities is the type of legal work available. Some 
argue that students in in-house clinics are able to engage in a fuller range 
of work with greater responsibility and actual client representation.87 
However, in Australia diverse types of legal work with large levels of 
responsibility are practised throughout each of the types of clinical 
legal education. In clinical components, for example, students actually 
interview clients88 and work on family law cases with a substantial 
degree of responsibility.89 In externships, students may represent clients, 
draft law reform submissions or draft legislation, develop community 
legal education projects and provide legal advice, among many work 
possibilities.90

</p>
<p>Students&rsquo; location and numbers
Another factor in choosing a clinical legal education model is the number 
of students that need to be accommodated within the program. If there is 
a law school commitment to provide a clinical legal education experience 
to all students&mdash;as is the case for Newcastle University, UNSW and the 
University of Western Sydney (UWS)91&mdash;and there are limited resources 
available, then the choice of model is also limited. For example, UWS 
gives students a five-day clinical exposure/component as it is committed 
to giving all law students some clinical experience.92
</p>
<p>Another aspect of the &lsquo;student&rsquo; factor is their location. Given the increase 
in online learning, the choice of clinical legal education program may be 
further limited. However, several universities in Australia are engaged in 
developing &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; clinics and these may offer new opportunities to law 
schools. 
</p>
<p>Conclusion 
In this chapter, we have clarified key terms and described the models of 
clinical legal education emerging in Australia. For each model we have 
identified both merits and some disadvantages. Finally, we have discussed 
a range of factors that need to be considered when choosing a model for 
clinical legal education.

</p>
<p>Introduction
In this chapter, we provide extensive detail to support an overall point: 
clinical course design is a complex, serious, pedagogical task that can 
too readily be overlooked or treated lightly. Many clinical courses are 
established with enthusiasm for innovative and novel legal education 
combined with public service provision. Although these can drive and 
sustain a clinical course for a while, there is a risk that longer-term 
sustainability and credibility will be compromised if the course is not 
designed and developed on a sound pedagogical basis. 
</p>
<p>Coverage 
We first define course aims, or objects, and suggest a number of possible 
aims that a clinical course might pursue. We then spell out the nature 
and interrelationship of course aims and learning outcomes&mdash;often 
poorly understood&mdash;and point out the wide range of available outcomes 
for a&nbsp; clinical course. As we discuss, the model of clinic on which the 
course will be based should follow from the course design, although the 
excitement of establishing a clinical course often puts the choice of the 
model first. Once established, a clinical course must deal with issues such 
as student selection and course content, course timing and length, all of 
which we canvass in this chapter.</p>

<p>Naming a &lsquo;course&rsquo; 
Throughout this chapter, the term &lsquo;course&rsquo; is used to refer to what is also 
called a &lsquo;subject&rsquo;, a &lsquo;unit&rsquo; or a &lsquo;module&rsquo;. A student will enrol in a number 
of&nbsp;law courses (or subjects or units or modules) in an academic semester or 
year, counting towards the award of a law degree. A course is, for example, 
assigned a code by the university administration, and is named according 
to its content (for example, Evidence, Contracts, Administrative Law, etc).
</p>
<p>Course aims and learning outcomes
</p>
<p>The fundamental importance of course aims 
Course design does not start with the teaching method. The first question 
is: what are the aims (or &lsquo;goals&rsquo;) of the course? We use the terms &lsquo;aims&rsquo; 
and &lsquo;goals&rsquo; to describe the same thing, although a case can be made for 
giving them distinct meanings;1 our point is to ensure that the larger aims 
or goals are established as a base for learning objectives. Only then is it 
possible to think about what teaching method will best meet those aims. 
As Stuckey reports Bellow saying in the United States over 40 years ago, 
&lsquo;clinical courses are only justified if they are accomplishing educational 
objectives that cannot be achieved by other, less expensive, methods of 
education&rsquo;.2 
</p>
<p>There is often confusion over the nature and place of educational aims,3 and 
enthusiasm for clinical teaching risks bypassing this basic issue (&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s run 
a clinic!&rsquo;) or leads to reverse engineering (&lsquo;We have a clinic! What will we 
do with it?&rsquo;). In 2007, Stuckey reported the persistence of a&nbsp;phenomenon 
Bellow had complained of over 30 years earlier: &lsquo;a&nbsp; tendency, within 
clinical programs, to subordinate the question of what should be taught 
to the demands of what students are actually doing&rsquo;.4 Even though clinical

<p>legal education is a powerful teaching method, there must be educational 
rigour associated with it if it is to be taken seriously over time, and that 
rigour requires course design that starts with clearly stated course aims.5
</p>
<p>It is fundamental to course design that the course aims are clearly 
articulated. Not only the teaching method, but topics, reading, and 
assessment (see Chapter 8) will be framed by&mdash;and be directed towards 
achieving&mdash;the course aims:
</p>
<p>proper evaluation and proper grading will only occur if the teacher and 
the student are aware of the clinic&rsquo;s goals and expectations, and if the 
teacher&rsquo;s recorded comments about their interventions and the student&rsquo;s 
performance are keyed to the goals and expectations that we have conveyed 
to students at the beginning of the clinic.6
</p>
<p>Referring to an externship clinic in particular, Smith illustrates the 
planning process well: 
</p>
<p>As the faculty member considers potential educational goals, she should 
compare the extern method with other available methods of instruction 
and ask whether a field placement (with a related academic component) 
is the best way to achieve those goals.7
</p>
<p>Once established, the course aims will at least imply, if not mandate, 
an&nbsp; appropriate teaching method. Aims do need to be revisited 
periodically; an ongoing process rather than something engaged in once 
or sporadically.8 A disincentive for continual review of educational aims, 
however, is the considerable investment that will have been made in the 
clinic: arrangements are not as easily put to one side as they can be for a 
standard course. But a review of educational aims should not be avoided 
for fear of discovering that the clinic is no longer an apt educational 
method. Rather, the review should be embraced as an opportunity to

<p>refine and redefine constituent parts of the clinic, such as those discussed 
below, ranging from student selection to case selection, and classroom 
content to methods of skills training.
</p>
<p>Distinguishing learning outcomes
The aims (or &lsquo;goals&rsquo;) of a course have to be distinguished from the intended 
learning outcomes of the course. Outcomes, discussed further below, are 
more specific than aims, and describe what it is that a student will know 
or be able to do as a result of learning in the course. Only when aims and 
outcomes are established is it then possible to determine the appropriate 
model of clinic. Overall, the relationships among aims, outcomes and 
methods are simply illustrated:

<p>Learning outcomes Clinical methodCourse aims
</p>
<p>Clinical course aims
Although Stuckey points out that &lsquo;[a]ny subject can be taught using 
experiential education&rsquo;,9 Hall and Kerrigan note that &lsquo;clinical legal 
education has its limits [and it is not] the best methodology for achieving 
all objectives of the law school&rsquo;.10 The challenge is &lsquo;to determine what 
lessons can be taught more effectively and efficiently using experiential 
education than through other methods of instruction&rsquo;.11 To make that 
assessment, it is necessary to know what it is that clinical teaching offers. 
To put it another way, what type of educational aims are well addressed 
by clinical teaching? If, as happens, a course is conceived of as a &lsquo;clinical 
course&rsquo;, before any course aims are first established, then a course must 
nevertheless be designed so that educational sense is made of the clinical 
experience in the context of the larger law curriculum.

<p>As we discuss in Chapters 6 and 7, clinical legal education is characterised 
by supervision, reflection and student responsibility, with a focus on 
social justice issues (see Chapter 5). It operates intensively, in one-on-
one or small group interactions, and allows students to apply legal theory 
and lawyering skills to solve legal problems that are real: students are in 
professional legal settings, working on real legal matters. Consistently 
with the &lsquo;spirit of inquiry&rsquo; promoted by Dewey curriculum theory12 and 
the power of experiential learning, the focus of clinical experience is to 
engage students with law as it operates, in context.13 Although clinical legal 
education has a vocational context, its educational effectiveness depends 
on its dynamic relationship with the substantive, doctrinal curriculum. 
</p>
<p>Clinical legal education has, however, the capacity to address some of the 
shortcomings of the Dewey approach in which the teacher is in control 
of the classroom dynamic and of the opportunities for student inquiry. 
Taking a lead from the radical education theories of Paulo Freire, it is 
possible in clinical legal education to address the interests of the poor 
and, in so doing, to engage students in critiquing power structures and 
relations and their resulting injustices (see Chapter 5).14 
</p>
<p>With these distinctive features of clinical legal education in mind, it is 
apparent that the aims of some courses will be better supported by clinical 
legal education method than others.15 Stuckey has proposed what he 
believes to be &lsquo;the five most important educational objectives that can 
be accomplished in clinical courses&rsquo;: developing problem solving skills; 
becoming more reflective about legal culture and lawyering roles; learning 
how to both behave and think like a lawyer; understanding the meaning 
of justice and lawyers&rsquo; responsibility to strive to do justice; and discovering 
the human effects of the law.16

</p>
<p>Stuckey does not offer evaluative criteria that support these as the 
&lsquo;most&nbsp;important&rsquo; aims of clinical legal education. In listing possible aims, 
it is worth keeping in mind Failinger&rsquo;s caution that, in light of all that 
clinical legal education can achieve, aims should be modest: &lsquo;a small 
handful of realistic goals for many law students &hellip; or an ambitious set 
of goals for very few students&rsquo;.17 Goldfarb points out that it is exactly the 
large promise of clinical legal education that requires &lsquo;clinical teachers to 
abandon some portion of what ideally [they] strive to achieve&rsquo;.18
</p>
<p>Legal doctrine as a course aim?
It is common that a doctrinal course has as its aim that students will, 
for example, &lsquo;understand the core concepts and principles underpinning 
contracts/torts/criminal/public law, and to comment critically on the 
outcome and reasoning in cases&rsquo;. Clinical method is not necessary to 
achieve these aims. However, the immediacy of the clinic can enable 
students to deepen their understanding of doctrine. Related aims may, 
for example, be for students to &lsquo;identify the considerations of policy 
that may underpin cases and legislation&rsquo;, &lsquo;to apply learned rules and 
principles to practice&rsquo;, &lsquo;to identify the practical implications of legislation&rsquo;, 
&lsquo;to&nbsp;understand current issues&rsquo;, and &lsquo;to identify weaknesses or gaps in the 
law&rsquo;. For each of the related aims, an integrated clinical component to 
otherwise doctrinal courses would be apt.19 
</p>
<p>Legal theory as a course aim?
Some courses do not aim to focus on pure legal doctrine, the law as it 
relates to particular social issues or communities, or substantive law with 
practical contexts, but will aim instead to explore larger issues of law, 
legal theory, legal policy and the operation of law in society. Course aims 
might be, for example, for students to &lsquo;assess the adequacy of feminist 
legal theory as an explanation for aspects of the criminal justice system&rsquo;, 
or &lsquo;to evaluate the effectiveness of public legal services in meeting unmet 
legal need&rsquo; and, in each case, clinical legal education will be an appropriate 
teaching method.

</p>
<p>Legal and professional skills as a course aim?
Some courses on substantive law may have aims that are quite explicitly 
skills-based; aims with which clinical legal education is more obviously 
aligned. This skills/clinic alignment is deceptive, however, and needs to 
be kept in perspective. Although clinical legal education is an effective 
method for teaching skills&mdash;as shown by the experience in the United 
States in particular&mdash;its primary focus is more analytical and reflective 
than the vocational aim of &lsquo;how to&rsquo; that characterises practical legal 
training (PLT) or work-integrated learning (WIL).20 While legal practice 
skills are taught in clinical legal education and used for the delivery of legal 
services, they are at the same time subjected to analysis and reflection, and 
the apparently value-neutral nature of such skills are critiqued to develop 
in students a consciousness of the value-laden nature of legal practice 
(see&nbsp;Chapter 5 for a more detailed discussion of this). 
</p>
<p>Courses such as, for example, litigation, civil and criminal procedure, 
evidence, succession or corporations, address subject matter that relates 
closely to, or is often well illustrated by, legal practice requiring particular 
skills such as drafting, negotiation, advocacy and interviewing. A dispute 
resolution course, for example, has skills potential when it aims for 
students &lsquo;to appreciate the context of litigation practice and procedure&rsquo; 
and &lsquo;to&nbsp; know the technical and strategic skills necessary to mediate 
a&nbsp;dispute and conduct litigation&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>Examples from the United States, where law is studied as a graduate degree 
with a strong vocational focus, tend to skew an appreciation of possible 
educational aims for clinic away from a broad range of possibilities towards 
preparation for legal practice.21 For many early clinical programs &lsquo;&ldquo;clinical&rdquo; 
&hellip; became synonymous with &ldquo;skills-focused&rdquo; education&rsquo;.22 However, in 
jurisdictions other than the United States, where law students are not 
necessarily as focused on an immediate legal career23 and could be studying 
other disciplines in concurrent degree programs, clinical legal education 
can demonstrate its capacity to meet a much broader scope of educational

<p>aims. Since the early 2000s in Australia, however, this characterisation 
has been changing to an extent, with the growing popularity of graduate 
(&lsquo;JD&rsquo;) law programs in which students have a more definite bent towards 
preparation for legal practice. 
</p>
<p>Where clinical legal education focuses on legal skills training, it should 
do so with a focus on &lsquo;students&rsquo; development of a professional identity 
that contributes to a sense of purpose in their lives&rsquo;.24 Legal skills that 
are taught in a clinic&rsquo;s practice context include &lsquo;accepting and assuming 
responsibility for matters of great importance to real clients&rsquo;, &lsquo;improving 
problem-solving abilities&rsquo;, &lsquo;collaboration&rsquo;, &lsquo;discovering facts and figuring 
out how to turn them into admissible evidence&rsquo;, and &lsquo;traditional skills&rsquo; 
such as &lsquo;interviewing, case planning, investigating facts, counselling, legal 
writing, witness examination, and oral argument&rsquo;.25 More broadly, clinical 
legal education is a teaching method that can meet aims of personal and 
professional development such as, for example, &lsquo;cross-cultural awareness&rsquo;, 
&lsquo;the role of emotions&rsquo;, &lsquo;creativity&rsquo;, &lsquo;exercising authority&rsquo; and &lsquo;learning 
to learn&rsquo;.26 Clinical legal education can teach legal doctrine,27 doctrinal 
analysis,28 and policy perspective on doctrine,29 and is a way of teaching 
legal professionalism, such as values and ethics,30 promoting a willingness 
to engage in law reform and pro bono services,31 and strengthening 
students&rsquo; emotional awareness and sense of ethical behaviour.32

<p>Social justice as a course aim?
Perhaps the most pervasive educational aim for a clinical course, apart 
from&nbsp; skills training, and certainly the most distinctive, is to attune 
students&nbsp; to issues of social justice,33 a course aim for students that is 
&lsquo;beyond being just practice ready&rsquo;.34 It is the contextual nature of clinical 
legal education, supported by supervision and reflection (see Chapters 6 
and 7), which makes it particularly effective in focusing on lawyers&rsquo; roles 
in achieving social justice (see Chapter 5). 
</p>
<p>There is a long and strong tradition in clinical legal education of aiming to 
inculcate social justice values that transcend mere legal service provision, 
and that &lsquo;produc[e] lawyers who will go on to change the nature and 
function of legal practice in the interests of more humane social values, 
and the advancement of the poor and disadvantaged&rsquo;.35 Such a conscious 
effort to promote social values may be warranted in light of research in 
Australia, which suggests that students who arrive at law school with 
&lsquo;[a] desire to engage in social justice or public interest practice&rsquo; lose that 
desire as they continue their studies,36 and students in their final year 
of legal studies are least likely to agree that law has &lsquo;the power to bring 
about positive social change&rsquo;.37 Indeed, a tendency to cynicism has been 
observed among law students,38 who may tend to be, at least, uninterested 
and &lsquo;ignorant about critical idealism and wider social perspectives&rsquo;.39

<p>Many courses are concerned with the law as it relates to particular social 
justice issues, such as housing, social security and discrimination law, or 
to particular communities such as Indigenous peoples, poor people,40 
women,&nbsp; children and refugees. These issue-specific courses are very 
contextual, and clinical legal education would be an effective method for 
meeting course aims that students will, for example, &lsquo;understand domestic 
legal issues affecting Indigenous peoples&rsquo;, or &lsquo;assess the effectiveness 
of&nbsp;legal remedies for human rights violations against Indigenous peoples&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>Public service as a course aim?
Most forms of clinical legal education in Australia bring with them their 
own necessary aim, that of providing legal services to a section of the 
public.41 This is a separate process that means &lsquo;understand[ing] the legal 
needs of the community and of the population the clinic hopes to help&rsquo;,42 
and brings with it the perennial dilemma in clinical legal education of 
how to meet the related but often competing goals of student education 
and client service: &lsquo;sensitivity to the balance between student needs and 
client needs must be considered at every decision-making juncture&rsquo;,43 
although in Reed&rsquo;s view &lsquo;the traditional emphasis [is] placed on the 
service goal rather than the educational goal&rsquo;.44 As we noted in Chapter 3, 
the&nbsp;Australian experience is that the joint aims of providing both student 
learning and client service can be accommodated.45

<p>Legal policy and law reform as a course aim?
A clinical course that aims to attune students to issues of social justice 
is likely to incorporate advocacy for changes to law and policy as 
a&nbsp; complementary course aim. It has been argued for some time that 
there &nbsp; is, in fact, an ethical obligation on legal education, and perhaps 
clinical legal education in particular, to pursue changes to law and 
policy in the public interest.46 A &lsquo;law reform&rsquo; aim complements aims of 
teaching both doctrine and professional skills: doctrine, simply because a 
conventional critical analysis of law should generate options for reform; 
and professional skills because conventional lawyers&rsquo; skills of research, 
drafting, negotiation and advocacy are necessary for effective law reform.

<p>Student wellbeing and engagement as a course aim?
Increasing attention is being paid to law students&rsquo; mental health and 
wellbeing.47 The dissonance between students&rsquo; justice aspirations 
and the actual law curriculum, noted above, is a significant factor in 
students&rsquo; distress, as is the intensely competitive nature of law school.48 
Complementing, say, the social values and social justice aims mentioned 
above, a clinical course can aim to meet a student&rsquo;s aspirations to work for 
justice, and can promote a collaborative and supportive work environment. 
An explicit aim of wellbeing may be particularly important for students 
from other cultural or legal traditions, such as Indigenous students,49 who 
risk feeling quite alienated from any real sense of law&rsquo;s role in society.

<p>Student aims?
In addition to teacher-determined aims, a clinic can aim to meet students&rsquo; 
own goals. While these will often be the same as the standard goals, they 
will sometimes be more personal,50 which may be difficult to incorporate 
into a planned curriculum other than through the reflective element of 
clinical legal education, and which risks seeing students&rsquo; &lsquo;career placement 
goals [being] elevated above educational goals&rsquo;.51 
</p>
<p>A conflict &lsquo;between the student&rsquo;s individual ambitions and the larger 
social aims of the clinic&rsquo;52 may have to be resolved. The student is on 
notice for the clinic, as for any conventional course, of the intended aims 
and will have to reconcile their own aims with those of the course they 
have chosen, thereby &lsquo;resisting&rsquo; student-led design.53 More constructively 
(but requiring more work), &lsquo;[c]ooperative learning theory posits that the 
role of the professor is to engage in &ldquo;the spirit of mutuality&rdquo; of learning 
between students and instructors&rsquo;,54 such that &lsquo;clinic students themselves 
can determine the subject matter and the political focus of their lawyering 
tasks&rsquo;.55 However, this does carry the risk that &lsquo;inexperienced law students&rsquo; 
motivation and excitement to tackle a social problem might lead to overly 
ambitious projects that could in turn lead to considerable frustration 
during implementation&rsquo;.56
</p>
<p>Clinical learning outcomes 
The aims of a clinical course are, effectively, a statement by the law school 
of why it is offering the course. From a different perspective, &lsquo;learning 
outcomes&rsquo; are a statement by the law school of what a student will be able 
to show they have learnt from a course:

<p>Simply put, learning outcomes are the skills and knowledge which it is 
intended that students should be able to demonstrate by the time the 
assessment processes for the course have been completed. The intention 
of learning outcomes is to give students more idea of what is expected 
of them during the course they are undertaking ... objectives state what 
the teacher plans to achieve, outcomes state what it is that the student 
should&nbsp;achieve.57 
</p>
<p>Learning outcomes are central to course design; they affect &lsquo;course content, 
practical experience and assessment&rsquo;.58 As a matter of best practice, a clinical 
course is &lsquo;designed to promote specified student learning outcomes&rsquo;. 
Materials, class time and activities are directed towards achieving the 
learning outcomes, casework is selected to support them, academic and 
practical content is designed to support them, assessment tasks align with 
them, and infrastructure investment is defined by what is necessary to 
achieve them.59 Literature on clinical legal education supports the central 
role of learning outcomes: they &lsquo;provide the framework for &hellip; teaching 
and methodology&rsquo;,60 they are &lsquo;important in the choice of suitable clinical 
models&rsquo;61 and they are the focus of an assessment regime. &lsquo;The&nbsp; main 
purpose of assessments in educational institutions is to discover if students 
have achieved the learning outcomes of the course studied.&rsquo;62 
</p>
<p>Even if statements of learning outcomes do not encompass everything a 
student might learn in the course, they &lsquo;force us to think more carefully 
about what we believe are the most important purposes of our courses and 
guide us in designing the delivery of the promised outcomes&rsquo;.63 Learning 
outcomes may not, however, be wholly at the discretion of the teacher,

</p>
<p>and may have to be articulated so as to conform to externally imposed 
outcomes required by, for example, the Australian Threshold Learning 
Outcomes (TLOs) for Law.64
</p>
<p>Terminology for learning outcomes
In drafting learning outcomes there is an important difference between 
merely describing what a student will have learnt and stating what 
a&nbsp;student will be able to do to show what they have learnt:
</p>
<p>useful learning outcomes are those which describe what the typical student 
will be able to do by the time the course has been completed, and which 
can be assessed to measure to what extent students have achieved these 
outcomes &hellip; a less useful outcome would describe the understanding that 
students are expected to have developed, whereas a more useful one would 
outline how they can articulate, or demonstrate this.65 
</p>
<p>Useful learning outcomes incorporate verbs that suggest activity 
on the part&nbsp; of the student. The Centre for University Teaching at 
Flinders University, for example, suggests verbs to follow the statement 
&lsquo;On&nbsp; successful completion of this (assignment/topic/course) students 
should be able to&rsquo;:
</p>
<p>analyse, apply, appreciate, classify, collaborate, compare, compute, 
conduct, contrast, define, direct, derive, designate, demonstrate, discuss, 
display, evaluate, explain, identify, infer, integrate, interpret, justify, list, 
name, organise, outline, report, respond, solicit, state, synthesise. 
</p>
<p>The Australian TLOs for Law specify, in relation to &lsquo;Thinking Skills&rsquo; for 
example, that graduates &lsquo;will be able to identify &hellip; articulate &hellip; apply &hellip; 
generate &hellip; engage in &hellip; and think creatively &hellip;&rsquo;.66 
</p>
<p>Clinical legal education scholarship often sets out learning outcomes 
of the &lsquo;less useful&rsquo; type, such as: &lsquo;I want my students to be able to &hellip;&rsquo;; 
&lsquo;I&nbsp;want my students to understand &hellip;&rsquo;; &lsquo;I want my students to learn the

<p>doctrine&nbsp;of&nbsp;&hellip;&rsquo;.67 These are not invalid, but they are less useful because 
it is difficult for both teacher and student to measure progress towards 
achieving them, and they are less amenable to assessment. More useful 
clinical learning outcomes are, for example: &lsquo;On completion of this course, 
students should be able to: explain &hellip; reflect &hellip; evaluate &hellip; identify &hellip; 
articulate &hellip; discuss &hellip; demonstrate &hellip;&rsquo;,68 and &lsquo;Students should be able 
to plan &hellip; develop &hellip; organise &hellip;&rsquo;.69 
</p>
<p>In Best Practices we proposed the following possible learning outcomes 
for&nbsp;clinical legal education:70
</p>
<p>Upon the completion of a clinical course, the clinical student will 
demonstrate: 
</p>
<p>critical analyses of legal concepts through reflective practice 
</p>
<p>an ability to work collaboratively 
</p>
<p>an ability to practise &lsquo;lawyering&rsquo; skills 
</p>
<p>developed interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence and self-
awareness of their own cognitive abilities and values 
</p>
<p>a developing ability to &lsquo;learn from experience&rsquo; 
</p>
<p>an understanding of continuing professional development and 
a&nbsp;desire for life-long self-learning 
</p>
<p>an understanding, and appropriate use, of the dispute resolution 
continuum (negotiation, mediation, collaboration, arbitration 
and litigation) 
</p>
<p>an awareness of lawyering as a professional role in the context 
of wider society (including the imperatives of corporate social 
responsibility, social justice and the provision of legal services to 
those unable to afford them) and of the importance of professional 
relationships

<p>a developing personal sense of responsibility, resilience, confidence, 
self-esteem and, particularly, judgment 
</p>
<p>a consciousness of multi-disciplinary approaches to clients&rsquo; 
dilemmas &ndash; including recognition of the non-legal aspects of 
clients&rsquo; problems 
</p>
<p>a developing preference for an ethical approach and an 
understanding of the impact of that preference in exercising 
professional judgment 
</p>
<p>a consolidated body of substantive legal knowledge, and knowledge 
of professional conduct rules and ethical practice, and 
</p>
<p>an awareness of the social issues of justice, power and disadvantage 
and an ability to critically analyse entrenched issues of justice in 
the legal system. 
</p>
<p>Whether, on completion of a clinical course, a student can in fact 
demonstrate these learning outcomes, is a matter for assessment 
(see&nbsp;Chapter 8).
</p>
<p>Choosing the type of clinic
As we said above, it is only after the course aims and outcomes are 
established that the appropriate model of clinic can be determined. In 
Chapter 3, we discussed the different possible models of clinic. Most of 
the possible learning outcomes that are mentioned above as best practice71 
are achievable in all of the models. A good reason to distinguish among 
the models is the degree of control that a law school can exercise over 
the clinic. Both in-house and external live client clinics have students 
working&nbsp;with clients under supervision, but the greater control that a&nbsp;law 
school can exercise over the work done by an in-house clinic gives scope 
for pursuing a wide range of learning outcomes. For an external live 
client clinic, the organisational goals of the agency can limit the range of 
possible learning outcomes, and so an agency should be selected with those 
constraints in mind. This is so to an even greater extent for externships, 
where the learning outcomes are achievable only within the bounds of 
the placement agency&rsquo;s own, independent goals, which places greater 
emphasis on the complementary content of the classroom, discussed

<p>below. Differently from any of these models, a substantive law course 
that has clinical components to it will have its own intended learning 
outcomes&mdash;often knowledge of doctrine&mdash;and the clinical method has 
been chosen within the established aims of that course. 
</p>
<p>When deciding on the type of clinic that will best achieve the intended 
learning outcomes, significant considerations are the nature of the work 
that the students will do, the practice methods that are used, the social 
contexts in which the work is done, and the issues that are commonly 
addressed. These are considerations that the law school will have in mind 
when deciding whether it needs to exercise more or less control over the 
clinic and, so, whether to work with an in-house clinic, an external clinic 
or a placement agency for externships (see Chapter 3).72 Eyster makes the 
point clearly, in relation to a placement clinic: 
</p>
<p>[T]he availability of particular placement opportunities should not 
completely govern the structure of the clinic. Rather, goals should be 
established for the program, and curricular decisions (including size; 
seminar topics and format; nature of placements; faculty involvement in 
supervision; and other factors) should derive from those goals &hellip; It simply 
does not make sense to decide where to place students, what to teach in 
the seminar, whether and how to train and supervise field instructors, 
without first having a clear understanding of the goals of the program.73
</p>
<p>Consider, for example, a learning outcome that &lsquo;the student will 
demonstrate an understanding, and appropriate use, of the dispute 
resolution continuum&rsquo;.74 The externship model allows the flexibility 
of choosing a range of placement sites whose work offers a student the 
opportunity to engage with a continuum of dispute resolution mechanisms, 
in areas of debt, employment or family law rather than, say, criminal law 
or domestic violence protection, and the opportunity for students to 
learn from other student experiences about dispute resolution. Consider 
another possible learning outcome: that a student will demonstrate 
&lsquo;an&nbsp;awareness of: lawyering as a professional role in the context of wider 
society; the imperatives of corporate social responsibility, social justice, 
and the provision of legal services to those unable to afford them; and the 
importance of professional relationships&rsquo;.75 For this outcome, the student

</p>
<p>84
</p>
<p>needs to be exposed to something other than conventional legal practice. 
Many externships with private or public legal practices will not offer the 
diversity of practice methods, contexts and issues required for this learning 
outcome, while an association with a community legal centre&mdash;whether 
in an in-house clinic, external clinic or externship&mdash;is likely to do so.
</p>
<p>Selecting students
Student demand for clinic often outstrips available places, necessitating 
the invidious task of selecting (and excluding) students. It is good practice 
to ensure that the selection process for students is administered by the 
university, not by the teacher, in a transparent and non-discriminatory 
manner, subject only to prerequisites that are clearly articulated.76 
Within these process requirements, there is a wide diversity of methods, 
ranging from ballot to interview, as we note below. Few of the accounts 
of methods for student selection say anything about the criteria, and few 
of the possible criteria have any real relationship with what a clinic will 
expect of a student. After an overview of the many possible methods for 
student selection, we examine possible valid criteria.
</p>
<p>Processes for selection
A national survey of clinic selection methods reports the many ways that 
students can be selected in Australia:77 ballot, priority of application, 
preference to final- or penultimate-year students, academic merit, 
&lsquo;suitability&rsquo; to meet a clinic site&rsquo;s needs, student interest and desire, 
experience, prerequisite subjects, social justice experience, previous 
volunteering, level of other commitments, and previous academic conduct. 
Methods used elsewhere include a simple sign-up sheet, a lottery, criteria-
based selection, written applications, essays,78 volunteer contributions,79 
interviews80 and grade-point averages.81

</p>
<p>Frustratingly, these accounts describe mere processes, and no account 
is given of the criteria that are applied to make those processes useful. 
A&nbsp;wide range of considerations are, notoriously, taken into account when 
selecting students for clinic but none is obviously valid for clinical legal 
education generally, and the most that can be said is that some, in some 
circumstances, may be a rational basis for selection and exclusion. 
</p>
<p>Common criteria for selection
It may be thought that, because of the particular demands of clinical 
legal education, students are more or less &lsquo;suitable&rsquo; to participate, 
having regard to, for example, prior experience in legal practice, levels 
of emotional maturity, or their having reached a later stage in the law 
degree program. In fact, the extent to which a student needs to &lsquo;know 
law&rsquo;, or to demonstrate &lsquo;maturity&rsquo;, will vary according to the aims of the 
course, the model of clinic and the type of work that is done. Bleasdale-
Hill and Wragg (who usefully distinguish the vocationally oriented nature 
of clinical legal education in the United States) discuss student selection 
considerations that arise, in their case, in the United Kingdom, and that 
are true for similar legal education systems such as that in Australia.82 
They express some sympathy for a view that preference could be given to 
students with a stated intention to practise law, but note that there is &lsquo;a 
certain degree of speculation&rsquo; in saying that such students are more likely 
to show commitment to the clinic, and they see no reason why those who 
do not wish to become lawyers should not be able to apply. 
</p>
<p>Care should be taken to not assume that a clinic student, in order to 
work and learn under supervision, needs either a practice-level command 
of&nbsp; legal principles or familiarity and comfort with challenging practice 
issues. Although the partnering organisation might seek students 
who have some prior &lsquo;real world&rsquo; experience, less experienced students 
can benefit more from the closely supervised and supported nature of 
clinical legal education. The partnering organisation will, understandably, 
be&nbsp;concerned to ensure that its service provision is not unduly compromised 
by the inability of clinic students to do what is needed. Reference here to 
&lsquo;unduly&rsquo; indicates an acceptance that clinic students may adversely affect 
service delivery to some degree, but within tolerable limits having regard 
to the joint goals of service and education (and, of course, clinic students

</p>
<p>86
</p>
<p>can have a positive effect on service delivery too). We noted in Chapter 3 
that good working relationships between university staff and the staff of a 
partnering organisation are critical to address the tension between service 
and education.
</p>
<p>Clinics will often avoid the hard task of seriously considering what, 
if&nbsp;any,&nbsp;prior knowledge or experience is actually needed, both to achieve 
the learning outcomes and meet the needs of a partnering organisation. 
The common proxy for a real or perceived need for previous experience is 
to give priority to later- or final-year students, avoiding a serious analysis 
of&nbsp; what is actually required to engage successfully with the course. 
One&nbsp;risk&nbsp;generated by this approach is that the clinic experience is more 
easily (and misleadingly) characterised as an exercise in work-readiness, 
putting undue emphasis on &lsquo;practice preparation&rsquo;. Another is that 
students have no opportunity to approach other law courses through the 
critical reflective lens they acquire in clinical legal education.83 Although 
there is a view that for younger, less practice-focused students, clinical 
legal education is inappropriate altogether,84 another view is that first-
year students will benefit from clinical methodology, particularly first-
year Indigenous students who may be at risk of withdrawing from their 
legal&nbsp;studies.85 
</p>
<p>In second semester of their first year, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
students at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), for example, 
learn basic interviewing skills and have the opportunity to interview 
clients at the in-house clinic. In their second or third year, all law students 
attend the in-house clinic for a class on interviewing skills, participate in 
a client advice session and write a reflective assignment.
</p>
<p>Valid criteria for selection 
There are two pedagogically sound considerations for admission 
into a&nbsp; clinic: the student&rsquo;s capacity to achieve the intended learning 
outcomes; and the service requirements of an external agency. As Massey 
and Rosenbaum put it: &lsquo;Client needs and pedagogical objectives drive

</p>
<p>the criteria for determining student enrollment in clinics.&rsquo;86 At times, 
adherence to these considerations will be compromised by external 
factors, such as expectations of a placement site, requirements imposed 
by the funder of a program and obligations imposed by the law school 
(for example, to final year students). However, we put those to one side 
in this analysis, except for issues of affirmative action and accommodating 
disability, which we address below. 
</p>
<p>The first consideration for admission into a clinic&mdash;the student&rsquo;s 
capacity&nbsp;to achieve the intended learning outcomes&mdash;will raise very few 
barriers to participation in a clinic. Achieving new doctrinal knowledge 
may, as&nbsp; in any law course, require prior knowledge of foundational 
concepts, and in a specialist clinic preference could be given to students 
with a demonstrated commitment to working in that particular field.87 
Other&nbsp;likely intended learning outcomes for a clinic can be achieved by 
any law student, to some degree. Only if a learning outcome is pitched 
at a level of demonstrating &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; or &lsquo;sophisticated&rsquo; ability, for 
example, is there a reason to enrol students with an existing level of ability. 
For&nbsp;example, &lsquo;at Monash University, admission into [the clinical course] 
Advanced Professional Practice generally requires satisfactory completion 
of Professional Practice&rsquo;, and the Griffith University course Advanced 
Family Law Clinic requires students to have completed the classroom-
based family law course.88 A clinic in which students will represent 
clients in court may have minimum expectations of students, but those 
expectations need to be clearly set out and closely tied to what is actually 
required of well-supervised students.89 
</p>
<p>The more influential consideration in setting prerequisites for clinic 
enrolment is the service requirements of an external agency, relevant for 
all models of clinic apart from the rare, fully in-house live client clinic, 
and the relatively uncommon occurrence of clinical components in 
doctrinal courses. For an external (or &lsquo;agency&rsquo;) live client clinic, and for

<p>although not necessarily, result in the need for minimum requirements 
for students on matters such as legal knowledge, legal practice skills, 
or&nbsp;familiarity with social issues or particular communities. 
</p>
<p>As we observed in Chapter 3, there can be a tension between the intended 
learning outcomes and an agency&rsquo;s service requirements. Addressing that 
tension in the context of clinic course design, Chavkin says: 
</p>
<p>In designing a clinic to maximize service to a client community, selection 
of a student would necessarily be based on the anticipated ability of that 
student to provide legal services to clinic clients. Students with poor skills 
and/or a lack of political commitment to serving low-income clients 
would be discouraged or prevented from enrolling. 
</p>
<p>By contrast, if the goal were to maximize educational benefits for students, 
to ensure that all students develop the skills and values necessary to be 
responsible and effective lawyers before they graduate, we would target 
clinic enrollment on the very students with the poorest skills and/or with 
the lowest level of commitment to serving under-represented populations. 
We would depend on the effectiveness of clinical methodology to 
transform the skills and values of these students and to ensure that clinic 
clients receive legal representation consistent with professional standards.90 
</p>
<p>The recommended best practice for clinical student selection in Australia 
is set out in this way:
</p>
<p>The process of student selection conforms to the university&rsquo;s regulations 
(in consultation with external agencies if relevant). The selection process 
is transparent and non-discriminatory. The prerequisites for selection are 
clearly articulated. The reasons for choosing particular methods of selection 
(which can include ballot, interview, stage of study or completion of a 
prior clinic) are articulated. There is no presumption that access to CLE 
courses and clinical experiences should be limited to later-year students.91 
</p>
<p>What needs to be added to this is that any prerequisites for selection, and 
any hurdles such as stage of study, completion of a prior clinic or being 
limited to later-year students, are in place only because they are necessary 
for the intended learning outcomes to be achievable, to ensure equity in 
students&rsquo; opportunities to undertake clinical course and, if required, to 
meet the service requirements of an external agency.

</p>
<p>Few of the usual processes for selecting clinic students can be justified 
as general rules. Each of them may be justifiable according to these 
considerations in particular circumstances. There is, for example, no 
necessary connection between a student&rsquo;s prior academic performance 
and their ability to meet a clinic&rsquo;s intended learning outcomes, or between 
a student&rsquo;s prior &lsquo;social justice experience&rsquo; and the service requirements of 
an external agency. Each clinical course needs to establish&mdash;and to be able 
to defend, when challenged by unsuccessful applicants&mdash;selection criteria 
that are relevant to the work, the intended learning outcomes of the clinic 
and the situation of the law school. 
</p>
<p>When no particular factors exclude a student and a clinic is open to all 
applicants, two methods of selection are commonly used, both relying 
on arbitrariness in place of evaluation against criteria. A more equitable 
system for &lsquo;neutral&rsquo; student selection than &lsquo;first-come, first-served&rsquo; is a 
ballot or lottery, &lsquo;a randomized selection process that gives every student 
an equal chance for selection&rsquo;.92 It is described in Best Practices as &lsquo;a process 
of random selection from all eligible students who express interest&rsquo;.93
</p>
<p>Actively promoting the opportunity to enrol
The social justice focus of clinical legal education, particularly in Australia 
(see Chapter 5), invites students to examine issues of social inequality. 
Student selection for a clinic is an opportunity for the clinic itself to 
demonstrate a commitment to redressing inequality, &lsquo;serving as a model 
for promoting diversity in law practice&rsquo;.94 We noted above that selection 
processes must be transparent and non-discriminatory, but they can go 
further, and can actively promote access to the clinic for students from 
socioeconomic groups that are under-represented among lawyers and 
law students. A clinic can promote opportunities for people&mdash;such as 
people with disabilities and people with carer&rsquo;s responsibilities&mdash;whose 
participation requires reasonable adjustments to be made. Rather than 
waiting for a person to bring issues of accessibility to a clinic&rsquo;s attention, 
the clinic can take anticipatory measures to ensure that it is accessible.

</p>
<p>Such&nbsp; measures could include flexible work hours and attendance 
requirements, audio-visual and other aids, adaptation of premises and 
workspaces and choosing accessible externship sites, waiving enrolment 
prerequisites, and adjusting assessment requirements.95
</p>
<p>Gibson points out that &lsquo;[i]t can be difficult for people with a disability 
to get into law schools, complete studies and get jobs as lawyers&rsquo;.96 
She&nbsp;suggests:
</p>
<p>Clinical staff can assist law school colleagues to experience and understand 
issues about disability through seminar programs on the issue, encouraging 
students with and without disabilities to present aspects of their work 
relating to disability rights, to encourage sessions at university level to be 
run for staff on disability issues and through collaboration on research on 
legal issues that incorporate issues of disability.97 
</p>
<p>Teaching in the classroom 
It is best practice for a clinic to have a classroom component: &lsquo;Each clinic 
includes classes that enable students as a group to examine the broader 
context of law and the legal system.&rsquo;98 In fact, the classroom component 
is a significant point of distinction between a clinical externship and 
a&nbsp;work internship in, for example, WIL. Our Best Practices research shows 
that most but not all clinics in Australia have a classroom component,99 
although Shrag reported in 1996 that a classroom component &lsquo;is not 
a&nbsp;universal practice&rsquo; in the United States.100 
</p>
<p>Consistently with all other aspects of a clinic, &lsquo;[t]he goal of the 
classroom component is of course inextricably linked to the overall 
goals of the program&rsquo;.101 In addition to any doctrinal content, and 
practice skills development,102 the classroom educates students in 
reflective practice, legal&nbsp; ethics, and the practice skills necessary to

<p>ensure a good quality of legal&nbsp; service to the client. The classroom is a 
structured environment in which&nbsp;students can place their experience in 
the context of academic reading, and share reflections on their clinical 
experience. Indeed, if nothing else, the classroom component is a way to 
help students reflect, to &lsquo;assess,&nbsp;optimize and build upon the placement 
experience&rsquo;.103 But&nbsp;enthusiasm for class is not necessarily shared by clinic 
students.&nbsp;Coss&nbsp;warns of &lsquo;[s]tudent resistance to a classroom component&rsquo;, 
because &lsquo;[h]aving their impatience to practice satisfied by the externship 
experience, [students] then resent the return to the classroom&rsquo;.104
</p>
<p>Conduct of the class
Classes for in-house and external live client clinics can be conducted for a 
single cohort of students, largely sharing a common clinical experience. In 
contrast, students in a class for an externship clinic are likely to be placed 
in a variety of different environments, creating both the opportunity for 
comparative experiences and the challenge of finding common ground. 
Although a class of externship students can be divided into &lsquo;groups with 
common experiences&rsquo;,105 Coss points out that &lsquo;[t]his has the disadvantage 
of losing the shared experiences of group discussions, where the very 
diversity of the settings is the enhancement&rsquo;.106 
</p>
<p>The actual conduct of classes in a clinic course needs to be considered 
carefully. Noting that &lsquo;creating a classroom where there is active student 
engagement is the aspirational clinic seminar model&rsquo;, Louis confesses that 
&lsquo;when I started &hellip; I was focused so much on what I needed to tell the 
students that I had very little time to absorb andragogical methodology&rsquo;. 
In other words, teaching a clinic class is different.107 
</p>
<p>Students&rsquo; expectations of both dynamic interaction and responsible 
participation have important implications for the conduct of classes 
in a clinic course. A clinical teacher ought not, for example, enter the

<p>classroom in &lsquo;the teacher&rsquo;s cloak&rsquo;, representing the conventional approach 
to legal education in which &lsquo;[s]uppression of the emotional and intellectual 
integrity of the pupil is the result [of an authoritarian pedagogy]; 
their freedom is repressed and the growth of their own personalities is 
stunted&rsquo;.108 Rather, a clinical teacher needs to approach the classroom as a 
facilitator of students&rsquo; learning,109 both respecting the experience they are 
getting and nurturing their capacity for reflection: &lsquo;[t]he professor acts as 
&hellip; tutor, rather than as someone who is professing at or dictating to the 
student&rsquo;.110 Students can take greater responsibility for their learning and 
participate in a respectful and trusting relationship with their supervisor.
</p>
<p>Apart from the role played by the teacher, the classroom activity itself 
needs to be dynamic, characterised by discussion, small group work, 
and simulations for skills development: &lsquo;the class work is designed to 
further the application of the concepts, do group work,111 and provide an 
opportunity for students to share challenges and solve problems through 
discussion and case rounds. Collaboration is encouraged&rsquo;.112 Citing 
Ledvinka,113 James114 and Maughan and Webb,115 Spencer describes 
&lsquo;a&nbsp;number of practical ideas that clinical teachers can employ&rsquo;:
</p>
<p>the classroom can be arranged to encourage reflection by avoiding 
placement of the teacher in the &lsquo;power&rsquo; role at the front; my own experience 
confirms that in a circle is best &hellip; [in lecture theatres] asking the students 
to sit in the front few rows is helpful, especially if the teacher can join 
them, or at least avoid being above or detached from them (such&nbsp; as 
behind a lectern or desk) &hellip; Small group or pair discussions provide 
opportunities for peer and self-assessment and also encourage discussion 
amongst less extroverted students who prefer not to speak frankly about 
personal experiences in front of a larger group.116

<p>Literature
Students should be expected to read, analyse and use academic, 
professional and practical material,117 and it is considered good practice 
that &lsquo;[t]he&nbsp;readings for the clinical course encourage a broad, critical and 
contextual analysis of law&rsquo;.118 Students&rsquo; resistance to reading materials, 
reported by Shrag,119 may be particular to the skills-focused practice-
oriented nature of clinical legal education in the United States, but 
even in that environment academic literature should be the basis of 
students&rsquo; critical analysis of their work. As an example, Smith points out 
that &lsquo;jurisprudence &hellip; can become alive as an applied skill as well as an 
inquiry into legal theory when the jurisprudence discussions are linked to 
[for&nbsp;example] judicial internships&rsquo;.120
</p>
<p>Quoting Andrew Goldsmith, Cooper and Trubek say:
</p>
<p>it is only through the fusion of [sociolegal] scholarship and practice that 
law students can learn to appreciate &lsquo;the full complexity of the lawyer&rsquo;s 
social role, including responsibility to clients, others, and oneself through 
empirical and conceptual understanding of what lawyering in society 
involves&rsquo;.121 
</p>
<p>This approach to clinical legal education assumes that a learning goal 
is indeed &lsquo;to appreciate the full complexity of the lawyer&rsquo;s social role&rsquo;. 
That is indeed a valid assumption for clinical legal education in Australia, 
which is to a very large extent an exercise in exploring issues of social 
justice (see Chapter 5). It should not be hard, therefore, for clinicians 
in Australia to &lsquo;transcend the theory-practice rhetoric&rsquo;,122 and to give a 
theoretical underpinning to clinical teaching, even in its practice-oriented 
skills aspects.

</p>
<p>The &lsquo;law-in-context&rsquo; focus of clinical legal education in Australia requires 
students to read and engage with literature about law and society. 
Ideas&nbsp;and&nbsp;manifestations of poverty, for example, are many and complex, 
and have to be understood by students if&mdash;as is often the case&mdash;a clinic is 
addressing legal causes of, and responses to, needs arising from poverty.123 
In any context, clinical legal education confronts students with challenging 
and problematic aspects of law in practice, inviting the most basic 
interrogation of issues of law and morality through, for example, theories 
of natural law and positivism, and deontology and consequentialism. 
</p>
<p>At the same time, students in clinical legal education are examining the 
roles of lawyers, and a critical analysis requires perspectives informed by, 
for example, philosophy, psychology and sociology.124 In relation to legal 
ethics (see Chapter 6), for example, &lsquo;professional responsibility can be 
approached as an exploration of philosophy which would be as theoretical 
as any other part of law school. Starting the inquiry into these issues from 
[clinic] performance &hellip; arguably strengthens the possibility of meaningful 
theoretical discussion&rsquo;.125
</p>
<p>Timing, scheduling and course credit 
</p>
<p>Length and scheduling of a clinical course 
The experiential nature of clinical activity militates against periods of 
short engagement. A range of respondents to our Best Practices research 
emphasised that there is a necessary minimum period to ensure that the 
clinical experience has meaning for the student. Depending on how the 
clinical course is structured, this minimum is generally put at a block of 
five consecutive days, or a day a week over a semester.126 However, there

</p>
<p>are views that in a live client clinic &lsquo;even one day can impact on a student&rsquo;, 
while an externship requires &lsquo;minimum two days a week for minimum 
20&nbsp;days for continuity and intensity&rsquo;.127 
</p>
<p>It was apparent from our Best Practices research that the usual level of 
student commitment over a full semester is at least one half day a week, 
and more usually one or two days, sometimes expressed in terms of hours 
(for example, six hours a week, 15 hours a week).128 We discuss below 
the implications this has for the value of course credit. Subject to our 
above view that it is best practice to run a clinical course over a semester, 
a clinical course with limited learning objectives can be structured to be 
offered in a block of days: daily for two weeks, for example, rather than 
one day a week for 12 weeks. This is especially the case for courses offered 
over a summer or winter break.
</p>
<p>In the discussion above about student selection, we noted a view that it is 
preferable to schedule a clinical course later in a law degree program so that 
students have more maturity and knowledge. But, as we said there, the 
extent to which a student needs to &lsquo;know law&rsquo; or to demonstrate &lsquo;maturity&rsquo; 
will vary according to the aims and learning outcomes of the clinic. It is 
therefore quite feasible to operate a clinic for first-year students, while a 
clinic with a specialist focus may have to be offered only to students who 
have studied particular prerequisite courses.
</p>
<p>Course credit value
As a matter of fairness to the students, the credit weighting of a clinical 
course can be approached in the same way as would be the case for a 
conventional course. In a conventional law course there is usually a tariff 
of a number of hours a week&mdash;say 10&mdash;that a student is expected to 
spend on class attendance, reading and preparation. That same tariff can 
be met by a clinical course that requires, say, one day&rsquo;s attendance each

</p>
<p>week as well as a classroom component. Clinics requiring more intensive 
attendance, or running for longer than a normal semester, can be weighted 
accordingly, perhaps being offered for double credits.
</p>
<p>Our Best Practices research showed that clinics in Australia commonly 
take this approach, broadly equating hours spent in a live client clinic 
or an externship with the student hours expected for a conventional 
law&nbsp;course.129
</p>
<p>Conclusion
The excitement of establishing and operating a clinical course can 
distract from the need for rigorous course design. A clinical course is a 
sophisticated exercise in legal pedagogy, and the tension between education 
on the one hand and client service on the other will be best managed if 
educational design is considered and entrenched. As we described above, 
this requires clearly stated aims and associated learning outcomes, which 
will determine such essential aspects as the clinic model, the classroom 
content, and&nbsp;student selection criteria.

Teaching social justice in clinics
</p>
<p>Introduction
Clinical legal education in Australia has many connections with social 
justice. In this chapter, we explore the longstanding relationship between 
clinical programs and community legal centres and how it has influenced 
the teaching of various aspects of social justice goals in Australian clinical 
courses. We explain how situating clinical courses in community legal 
centres gives a particular context to teaching legal ethics and challenges 
concepts of value-neutral, objective lawyering, and how teaching lawyering 
skills in community legal centres highlights the legal skills required in a 
social justice setting. We look at how the community legal centre context 
focuses on &lsquo;access to justice&rsquo; as one understanding of social justice, and 
at other connections between social justice and clinical legal education 
such as multidisciplinary practices, community engagement, working on 
law reform, community legal education and community development. 
We examine the implications of the growth in clinical externship courses 
in Australia for the connections to social justice issues; while the growth 
in externships has built on the strong tradition of social justice goals in 
clinical courses in Australia, it has also diversified clinical courses into 
areas not explicitly related to social justice. We point out that through 
classroom discussion and readings the relationship between the legal 
system and social justice can be explored even in externship courses that 
are not explicitly &lsquo;justice-related&rsquo;.</p>

</p>
<p>The idea of &lsquo;social justice&rsquo; in law
Although the term &lsquo;social justice&rsquo; is widely used, it is usually undefined. 
It is a contested concept, meaning different things to different people. 
It&nbsp;may be that &lsquo;[a]t the present time it is almost unthinkable to be against 
the idea of social justice&rsquo;,1 but that same idea was notoriously dismissed by 
Hayek as having &lsquo;no meaning whatsoever&rsquo;.2 A generally accepted meaning 
of social justice is a state of fairness and equity,3 and of &lsquo;inclusion&rsquo; or even 
&lsquo;justice in general&rsquo;,4 although ideas of what is fair will play out differently 
for different disciplines and in different circumstances. Buettner-Schmidt 
and Lobo&rsquo;s research leads them to conclude that although there are 
&lsquo;differences among and within the various disciplines about the uses of 
social justice &hellip; the goal of obtaining social justice, that is, attaining 
fairness and equity, appeared to be similar in each discipline&rsquo;.5 
</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;social justice&rsquo; has a long history.6 However, more recently, 
especially after Rawls&rsquo; seminal A Theory of Justice,7 a general, contemporary 
idea of social justice usually entails the provision to all people of basic 
human needs including income, housing, education and health care; 
equal enjoyment of human rights including non-discrimination, freedom 
of expression and movement, the right to liberty and the right to live 
free from violence; and some redistribution of resources to maximise the 
position of the worst-off. 
</p>
<p>An idea of social justice along these lines is comfortably accepted in 
Australia as a legitimate progressive social policy position, contested by 
conservative commentators. This level of acceptance is quite different 
from the position in the United States, where social justice is often seen as

<p>liberty.8 Even so, the idea of social justice is an accepted goal of many 
professional disciplines in the United States, such as nursing, public 
health, law and economics.9 
</p>
<p>In their multidisciplinary research on the issue, Buettner-Schmidt and 
Lobo found that in the discipline of law, the social justice emphasis is on 
&lsquo;empowerment [of under-represented minority groups], a just ordering 
of society and [a process of ] remedying of oppression&rsquo;.10 This is an apt 
description of the concerns of community legal centres in Australia, and 
suggests what some of the content of a clinical legal education course 
might be in a community legal centre environment. 
</p>
<p>In fact, in clinical legal education (and the legal education curriculum 
more generally) the idea of social justice is often narrowed to a specifically 
legal characterisation of &lsquo;access to justice&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;Access to justice&rsquo;
Access to justice is usually seen by lawyers as access to the legal system 
(the&nbsp;so-called &lsquo;justice&rsquo; system). In this sense, the fair and effective operation 
of the legal system is itself &lsquo;justice&rsquo;11&mdash;&lsquo;[t]he purpose of court proceedings 
is to do justice according to law&rsquo;12&mdash;and so access to justice is concerned 
with the extent to which people understand the law, are able to get legal 
advice and representation, and are able to make or defend a claim. More 
narrowly still, access to justice can be seen simply as &lsquo;making it easier for 
people to solve disputes&rsquo;.13 
</p>
<p>In contrast, in their daily practice, community legal centres focus 
on &lsquo;access to justice&rsquo; as an aspect of social justice. Access to justice is 
multifaceted, and can be a measure of the extent to which &lsquo;justice&rsquo; is done 
by law in a range of ways, such as punitive retribution, victim recognition, 
wealth redistribution, loss compensation and rights vindication. But law

<p>can, of&nbsp; course, be used to advance social causes both progressive and 
conservative, and &lsquo;access to justice&rsquo; can have a strong political dimension 
to it that, as we explain below, can be problematic in some clinics.14
</p>
<p>More broadly, access to justice can have a meaning that is removed from 
a necessary connection with law: &lsquo;access to justice is not just a matter of 
bringing cases to a font of official justice, but of enhancing the justice 
quality of the relations and transactions in which people are engaged&rsquo;.15 
This takes the idea of justice away from an exclusively legal context, and 
addresses issues of justice in &lsquo;primary institutional locations of [people&rsquo;s] 
activity&mdash;home, neighborhood, workplace, business setting and so on&rsquo;.16 
</p>
<p>As we note below when discussing social justice practice in clinics, ideas 
of social justice and access to justice tend to overlap or conflate. While 
some precision might be expected when designing learning outcomes 
of a clinical course (see Chapter 4), it is perhaps sufficient to say that 
clinical practice is an opportunity for students to analyse and reflect on 
the relationship between law and these various ideas of access to justice 
and social justice, and the part that lawyers play. 
</p>
<p>Clinical legal education and social justice 
Clinical legal education in Australia was imbued from the outset with an 
ethic of social justice,17 as courses were established by law schools whose 
critical approach to legal education explored the intersections of law and 
social justice.18 Early clinical teachers and academics in Australia shared 
a&nbsp;progressive vision of legal education, and saw:

<p>a social, political and moral agenda in &hellip; teaching, an agenda that exposes 
students to the maldistribution of wealth, power and rights in society, 
and that seeks to inculcate in them a sense of their own ability and 
responsibility for using law to challenge injustice by assisting the poor 
and the powerless.19 
</p>
<p>Within this legal education environment the Australian clinical movement 
has, since the beginning, been closely linked to community legal centres. 
</p>
<p>The 1960s and 1970s were times of questioning social hierarchies in 
Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and in Europe.20 
As&nbsp;Neal has observed, &lsquo;[s]omething big happened to public consciousness 
about law and power in the 1970s. Somehow law got caught up in a 
broader social upheaval about equality and poverty and the scales that 
masked the power embedded in legal relations fell away&rsquo;.21 In the new law 
schools this was reflected in a critical approach to legal education in both 
the curriculum and extra curricula activities. The University of New South 
Wales (UNSW) Law School and its staff and students were associated 
with the Australian Legal Workers&rsquo; Group, the Prisoners&rsquo; Action Group 
and the Feminist Legal Action Group and, in its curriculum, UNSW 
offered courses in poverty law, social security and housing.22 Its&nbsp; staff 
and students established and staffed Redfern Legal Centre.23 Monash 
University was similarly exploring new ways of teaching law and was well 
connected to community legal centres in Victoria, particularly in the 
founding of Springvale Legal Service.24 And &lsquo;[t]he founders of the Legal 
Studies Department at La Trobe University wanted to focus on law as a 
social institution and to make the power associated with legal knowledge 
widely available not only to its students but also to a wider public&rsquo;.25

<p>This&nbsp;early commitment to social justice among emerging law schools in 
the 1970s has persisted and &lsquo;social justice&rsquo;&ndash;designated projects, activities 
and positions exist at a number of law schools in Australia.26

<p>Clinical legal education and community 
legal centres 
Just as clinical legal education in the United States had its origins &lsquo;in&nbsp;the 
fight against poverty, injustice and under-representation of minority 
interests in the legal process&rsquo;,27 so clinics in Australia have always been in &lsquo;a 
symbiotic relationship [with] legal aid agencies, in particular community 
legal centres &hellip; with a deep commitment to access to justice&rsquo;.28 Founders 
of the clinical movement in Australia29 had previously worked in and 
with community legal centres (independent, non-profit legal services),30 
and the first clinical programs were established as &lsquo;live client clinics&rsquo; 
in a community legal centre setting. Monash University collaborated 
with Springvale Community Aid and Advice Bureau in 1973,31 and 
then established the clinic in 1975. La Trobe University explored the 
use of paralegal students in client service from the mid-1970s and, in 
1978,&nbsp; arising from the Henderson Commission of Poverty,32 it funded

Legal&nbsp;Service as a clinic.33 UNSW established its first clinic as a community 
legal centre, Kingsford Legal Centre, in 1981.34 
</p>
<p>Community legal centres &lsquo;are committed to striving for equitable access to 
the legal system and justice, and the equal protection of human rights&rsquo;.35 
Three essential aspects of community legal centre work are the provision 
of legal advice and the conduct of casework for disadvantaged clients 
and communities, the provision of community legal education, and the 
promotion of law and policy reform. Community legal centres work 
in legal areas that affect disadvantaged people in the community,36 and 
their advice and casework in civil law is mostly in the areas of tenancy, 
credit and debt, administrative law, social security, family law, and family/
domestic violence, all areas of work that have an affinity with issues 
of&nbsp;social justice.37
</p>
<p>The claim by community legal centres that they work for equitable 
access to the legal system and to improve social justice has not gone 
unchallenged. Rich has criticised community legal centres for being 
overly focused on individual casework and advice.38 Rich argues that they 
should adopt a &lsquo;law and organising&rsquo; model that seeks the transformation 
of clients&rsquo; lives, rather than dealing with their individual legal problems, 
and she advocates the importance of law reform work that is linked to 
social justice. This critique is significant and has caused many to question 
the role of community legal centres.39 Nevertheless, a recurring theme 
in our research into the operation of clinical programs in Australia has 
been the reference to &lsquo;social justice&rsquo; as a touchstone or guiding principle

Engaging in law reform work to improve the law or legal system for 
disadvantaged communities is also a significant aspect of various law 
schools&rsquo; clinical offerings.45 
</p>
<p>Working with other professions 
A significant beneficial legacy in Australia of co-locating clinics with 
community legal centres is the exposure clinic students get to the 
multidisciplinary practice that characterises many centres. Since the 
outset, community legal centres have recognised that clients rarely 
have only a legal problem, and that their legal problems commonly 
arise from other social issues, such as poverty and related problems of 
housing, unemployment, debt, literacy, health and domestic violence.46 
As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, a &lsquo;legal&rsquo; client actually needs support and intervention from a 
range of other professional services including social workers, counsellors,

<p>and&nbsp; therapists.47 These&nbsp; complementary services are sometimes available 
within and as part of a community legal centre or are available from 
co-located social services or by referral to other services. 
</p>
<p>The opportunity to work with professionals and students in those other 
disciplines characterises many of the community legal centres in which 
clinical courses are located.48 The Southern Communities Advocacy 
Legal and Education Service (SCALES), for example, hosts the Murdoch 
University legal clinic, which focuses on refugee and immigration 
law and frequently works with social workers and torture and trauma 
counsellors.49 The degree of multidisciplinary practice varies from agency 
to agency&mdash;at one end of the scale two professionals can address a client&rsquo;s 
needs cooperatively but, essentially, independently (commonly the case 
in community legal centres) while, at the other end, two professionals 
can address a client&rsquo;s needs in close collaboration, consciously working 
together in a joint enterprise to understand and meet the client&rsquo;s needs. 
</p>
<p>Multidisciplinary clinics 
A multidisciplinary practice creates the opportunity for a multidisciplinary 
clinic where students of different disciplines can share a&nbsp;clinical experience. 
For a period, the UNSW clinic at Kingsford Legal Centre operated a 
multidisciplinary clinic, employing a social work academic who supervised 
social work students on placement alongside law students, in a shared 
clinic experience.50 
</p>
<p>A substantial current example is the multidisciplinary clinic at the 
Monash-Oakleigh Legal Service, comprising supervisors and students 
from the Faculties of Law, Medicine, Business and Economics and Arts.51 
Hyams and Gertner wrote that &lsquo;[b]y focusing on assisting low income

</p>
<p>academic staff and students involved in the practice would deliver 
&ldquo;whole of person&rdquo; services to the community on a permanent basis&rsquo;.52 
The multidisciplinary clinic has concentrated on refining its cross-
disciplinary supervision and student debriefing protocols to ensure that 
the objective of a &lsquo;whole of person&rsquo; service is not dissipated by competing 
priorities among supervisors or student despair that can accompany their 
recognition of the enormity of a &lsquo;whole person&rsquo; life in disarray. When 
handled correctly, these experiences make not just law but also medical, 
social work and finance students acutely aware of the justice dimensions 
of their professionalism. 
</p>
<p>A multidisciplinary clinic offers students a powerful counter to 
conventional legal education, which both explicitly and unconsciously 
promotes Lopez&rsquo;s idea of &lsquo;regnant lawyering&rsquo;&mdash;a form of lawyering that 
assumes the centrality of the lawyer to the process rather than placing the 
client&rsquo;s vision and needs at the centre.53 One of the key learnings that law 
students take away from working with another discipline is that an issue 
can be addressed in many ways, not only through law, and that other 
ways of dealing with problems may be more effective than a purely legal 
approach.
</p>
<p>In a multidisciplinary clinic, students receive a strong message that 
teamwork is key to effective work. Law students commonly work with 
social work or other professionals to help the client resolve their issues, 
working not in an isolated and individual way, but collaborating in a&nbsp;team. 
This shows students another way to practise law, in stark contrast to the 
conventional model of legal practice, which focuses on an individual 
lawyer representing an individual client. 
</p>
<p>Differing professional rules and ethical understandings among professional 
disciplines also provide rich ground for law students to discuss the role 
of lawyers. A multidisciplinary clinic enables students to see that, unlike 
lawyers&rsquo; professional conduct rules, the conduct rules of other disciplines 
recognise social justice as an explicit ethical responsibility.54

</p>
<p>The opportunity for law students to collaborate with a range of skilled 
professionals reinforces the message that a client is a &lsquo;whole person&rsquo;, not 
a combination of problems, and that law is not the only means through 
which to address clients&rsquo; issues. Multidisciplinary approaches are inherently 
related to social justice purposes as they challenge each discipline&rsquo;s view 
of its own centrality in resolving issues, and encourage students to think 
broadly about their role as future lawyers.
</p>
<p>Growth in clinical externship courses
As we discussed in Chapters 1 and 3, externships are an area of growth in 
clinical legal education. Our Best Practices research project found that of 
all the universities in Australia who have clinical legal education courses, 
over half of those courses are externships.55 Many externship placement 
sites are community legal centres, maintaining the historical relationship 
with clinical legal education.56 
</p>
<p>Externships have also grown through partnerships with a wide range of 
public legal agencies other than community legal centres.57 Different 
course aims and learning outcomes have taken many of these externships 
away from a social justice orientation, and place students with agencies 
that provide clinical legal experience but do not engage in social justice&ndash;
oriented activity. Even so, any externship placement course can aim to 
give students the opportunity to critically examine law and lawyers from a 
social justice perspective, in a concurrent classroom component supported 
by readings and discussion, and in reflective practice.

<p>International opportunities can be complicated by issues of interruption 
to studies, insurance, risk, expense and, related to expense, equity of 
student access. Although students can and do travel overseas for a clinical 
externship in another country,58 communications technology such as 
email, voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) and internet video services 
mean that an NGO in another country can conduct remote supervision 
of clinical students who remain &lsquo;at home&rsquo; while working on research and 
writing projects for the externship.59 Clinical courses that have &lsquo;placed&rsquo; 
students as clinical interns in this way have been offered at ANU60 and 
QUT,61 working with NGOs in Vietnam, Thailand, Laos and Swaziland.62 
</p>
<p>The practice of social justice in clinics
Clinics commonly have &lsquo;access to justice&rsquo; course aims and related 
learning outcomes. At the same time, community legal centres, where 
many clinical courses operate, have a broad social justice mission. But, as 
discussed above, the idea of social justice lacks precision. Its place in law, 
or as a goal of the operation and practice of law, is further complicated by 
a legal focus on &lsquo;access to justice&rsquo;, a term that itself has various meanings.

<p>In&nbsp;both clinics and community legal centres, concrete aspects of social 
justice and&nbsp; access to justice are often not directly addressed and these 
concepts tend to overlap or conflate. 
</p>
<p>As we discuss in the following sections, a community legal centre 
environment enables analysis of and reflection on justice issues in a 
wide variety of ways. Clinical courses often focus on specific areas of 
law and legal practice, on skills development, and on ways of working 
professionally, such as in a multidisciplinary clinic. Giddings points 
out that &lsquo;[c]linics have pursued social justice objectives by working well 
beyond the traditional service delivery model of advice and representation 
for individual clients&rsquo;,63 and in the following section we canvass some of 
the different ways that clinics can pursue social justice goals.
</p>
<p>Skills development 
Clinical legal education is clearly an effective means of teaching lawyering 
skills.64 The question in a clinical course is not whether to teach skills or 
something else, but whether to teach something more about skills and 
examine what a lawyer can do with those skills.65 One thing a lawyer can 
aspire to do with their legal skills is pursue social justice; there is a nexus 
between legal skills and social justice, such that &lsquo;the skills development 
and social justice dimensions of clinical legal education [share] a strong 
unifying justification&rsquo;.66 
</p>
<p>Skills are not value-neutral. Reference is commonly made to teaching 
&lsquo;just skills&rsquo;, which suggests that skills are taught in a vacuum. An entire 
account of &lsquo;best practices for legal education&rsquo;, for example, characterises 
the teaching of skills as merely an exercise in professional competence, 
with no critical component.67 Teaching &lsquo;just skills&rsquo; ignores the potential

</p>
<p>to explore the implications of a lawyer&rsquo;s use (or not) of a legal skill in 
a&nbsp;particular circumstance, and fails to appreciate that the way a skill is 
used reflects the lawyer&rsquo;s own values (perhaps unconsciously) about the 
client and the legal matter. 
</p>
<p>In teaching interviewing skills, for example, clinical legal educators will 
often emphasise a client-centred approach. The importance of listening 
to the client and treating them as a person, not just as a legal problem, 
is stressed, reflecting social justice values such as people&rsquo;s dignity and 
right to equality. Teaching interviewing skills will also frequently focus 
on developing students&rsquo; awareness of their preconceptions about clients, 
leading easily into a discussion about stereotypical views the student may 
have,68 and &lsquo;the effects of race, class and &hellip; gender on the interaction 
between lawyer and client&rsquo;.69 
</p>
<p>At its most complex and analytical, skills teaching can be seen as truly 
complementary to a clinic&rsquo;s social justice mission, enabling students to 
&lsquo;suspend judgment, to communicate and listen across differences and to 
explore solutions creatively&rsquo;.70 
</p>
<p>Although critical perspectives on lawyering&mdash;for example, on exercising 
power, mediating law&rsquo;s differential impact, and promoting reform&mdash;are 
available for any area of law, a critical perspective is more likely to be taken 
in a clinic involved in work that is explicitly concerned with exactly those 
aspects of lawyering. Conversely, critical perspectives may be less likely to 
arise in a clinic whose work implicitly accepts and relies on the established 
relations of law and power in society. 
</p>
<p>Class content and readings
The classroom component of a clinical course complements the teaching 
and learning occurring in the clinic&rsquo;s legal practice (see Chapter 4), 
and frequently focuses on legal theory and concepts of justice, on skills

<p>development and on areas of law relevant to community lawyering such 
as the legal aid system, housing law, employment law, debt and family law. 
Practice skills such as working with cultural competency, interviewing, 
negotiation, advocacy, and doing effective law reform work are taught in 
ways that specifically relate to disadvantaged client groups, emphasising 
the centrality of the client. Teaching plain English drafting, for example, 
both improves conventional lawyer communication, and addresses one 
of&nbsp;the demands of &lsquo;access to justice as access to law&rsquo; discussed above. 
</p>
<p>Legal ethics 
A clinic in a social justice setting, such as a community legal centre, 
offers a rich opportunity for the study of legal ethics, professional 
responsibility and models of lawyering. For many years, for example, 
the La Trobe University legal ethics course offered this opportunity 
through its external, live client clinical course in successive partnerships 
with a Victoria Legal Aid office and West Heidelberg Community Legal 
Service.71 In these clinics, La Trobe students interviewed, advised, and 
represented clients using clinical tools of supervision and reflection that 
&lsquo;[encourage] students to critically analyse the law of lawyering including 
the various codes of practice and their rationales within a framework of 
access to justice issues, a client centred approach and a recognition of the 
public role of a legal practitioner&rsquo;.72 To the same end, UNSW incorporates 
a&nbsp;clinical component within the mandatory ethics course, enabling all law 
degree students to interview clients and then reflect on the role of lawyers 
and the capacity of law as a vehicle to achieve justice.73 
</p>
<p>Clinics provide the opportunity for students to reflect on the standard 
conception of a lawyer as a value-neutral, partisan and adversarial 
advocate for their client, and to actively consider other ethical approaches

<p>to lawyering, such as responsible lawyering, moral activist lawyering, and 
an ethic of care.74 Clinic cases in social justice settings such as community 
legal centres are an excellent vehicle for alternative perspectives such as 
these, enabling students to explore their values and to ask themselves 
broader ethical questions about their part, as lawyers, in improving access 
to justice and working to achieve social equality. Curran, Dickson and 
Noone, for example, describe their use in a clinic of ethical lawyering 
paradigms, drawing on the work of Parker and Evans to encourage 
students to reflect on the different approaches that a lawyer can take 
in lawyer&ndash;client relations: the zealous advocate (for one of the parties), 
the&nbsp; responsible lawyer (for a just outcome within the legal system), 
the&nbsp;moral activist (for a morally just outcome) and an ethic of care (for&nbsp;the 
parties&rsquo; wellbeing).75 Analysing ethical frameworks enables students to 
understand moral activist lawyering, or &lsquo;cause lawyering&rsquo;,76 and how it 
contributes to law&rsquo;s pursuit of social justice goals.77 
</p>
<p>In these social justice settings, a clinic invites students to see that lawyers 
have agency. That is, the students have opportunity and responsibility, 
in&nbsp;contrast to the implicit lesson of conventional legal education that can 
encourage students:
</p>
<p>to think like lawyers by adopting an emotionally remote, morally neutral 
approach to human problems and social issues, distancing themselves from 
the sentiments and suffering of others, avoiding emotional engagement 
with clients and their causes, and withholding moral judgment.78 
</p>
<p>Ethical discussions in a clinic setting can illustrate to students that lawyers, 
rather than being mere instruments of neutral positivist law, have choices 
about the clients they serve, the cases they take, the positions they adopt 
and about how they relate to clients, communities and causes.

<p>Clinical legal education encourages students to reflect critically on both 
the influence on their work of stereotypical assumptions about clients 
and on their personal reactions to their clients. These views can influence 
how they perform their legal work and the decisions they make about 
actions to take in a legal case. For example, a student might assume when 
working with a client with an intellectual disability who wants to make a 
power of attorney, that they do not have the capacity to execute this type 
of legal document. Challenging this assumption provides an opportunity 
to explore concepts of disability, legal capacity, and the role of the lawyer. 
Models of client empowerment, and the assumption of &lsquo;inability&rsquo; when 
working with clients with disability,79 can be discussed immediately with 
students. This experience is an opportunity for students to reflect on 
client-centredness in legal practice.
</p>
<p>Part of a supervisor&rsquo;s role in helping students to envisage themselves as 
lawyers is to model types of lawyering. One such model is &lsquo;community 
lawyering&rsquo;. Cody says that &lsquo;[c]ommunity lawyering seeks to improve 
the daily lives of community members&rsquo;, and is defined as &lsquo;lawyering for 
both individuals and communities, aware of how power may influence 
the relationships between lawyer and client and responsive to the needs 
of communities&rsquo;.80 Community lawyering often involves a partnership 
between lawyers and communities to achieve structural or real change in 
their lives; it may involve, but goes beyond, individual claims.81 Modelling 
community lawyering in clinics provides career options to students. 
</p>
<p>The continuing connections between many clinics and community legal 
centres mitigates to an extent the &lsquo;waning of student commitment to the 
public interest&rsquo;82 and students&rsquo; cynicism about practising law for justice.83

</p>
<p>A clinical legal education experience helps counter any tendency that law 
students may have to be uninterested and &lsquo;ignorant about critical idealism 
and wider social perspectives&rsquo;.84
</p>
<p>The modelling of approaches to lawyering by supervisors raises the issue 
of a clinic&rsquo;s own ethical approach to teaching, and the opportunity to 
practise transformative ethics.85 Transformative ethics promote:
</p>
<p>perspective transformation ... the process of becoming critically aware 
of how and why our assumptions have come to constrain the way we 
perceive, understand and feel about our world; changing these structures 
of habitual expectation to make possible a more inclusive, discriminating, 
and integrating perspective; and finally, making choices or otherwise 
acting upon these new understandings.86 
</p>
<p>If students&rsquo; assumptions and judgments are to be challenged, then it is 
essential for a clinic to adopt an explicit ethic of perspective transformation. 
An effective clinic challenges students&rsquo; willingness to apply legal rules to 
neatly stated problems, dispassionately and without regard to personal 
values. Engaging in perspective transformation through systematic 
reflection enables students to make constructive use of the opportunity 
that a clinic gives them to question their ways of looking at the world and 
to open themselves to alternatives. 
</p>
<p>As with any legal practice, a clinic operates within the formal, prescribed 
framework of professional ethics, and therefore presents regular 
opportunities to consider the apparently strict and clear ethical duties 
set out in legal profession practice rules.87 A pedagogical advantage

<p>that a&nbsp;clinic has over the classroom in teaching ethics is that the ethical 
issues are neither abstract nor clear cut: they relate to a real client, giving 
them authenticity, immediacy, complexity and variability. A pedagogical 
advantage that a clinic has over legal practice in teaching ethics is that the 
spontaneous ethical issue&mdash;or the unnoticed one&mdash;is more easily identified 
and managed in a safe and supportive environment, in discussion with 
peers and supervisors.88
</p>
<p>Of the prescribed ethics rules of legal practice, those concerning 
confidentiality and conflict of interest often arise in a clinic. Difficult 
issues concerning client confidentiality, for example, frequently arise in a 
community legal centre or legal aid practice where a lawyer may be told 
of possible harm to a child.89 In a case where a client describes a violent 
family relationship, possibly exposing children to seeing and hearing 
violence, students and their supervisors must consider the limits of the 
duty of confidentiality and the possible harm that might follow when they 
respect that duty.90 This responsibility can be discussed alongside models 
of client empowerment in domestic violence,91 incorporating feminist 
perspectives of social change and, in the process, encouraging students to 
more confidently explore the permissive exceptions to confidentiality that 
apply in most conduct rules.92 This process not only challenges students to 
gain a deeper understanding of the gendered nature of domestic violence, 
but also encourages them to critique ethical and legal duties from feminist 
perspectives. The social justice dimension of this arises when, for example, 
students explore how law commonly reflects the values of dominant 
groups and may or may not incorporate women&rsquo;s needs. Students can

<p>see that law and perceptions of &lsquo;justice&rsquo; are not synonymous; they are 
encouraged to recognise that law is value laden and that it frequently 
reflects the needs and values of the powerful in the community.93
</p>
<p>Justice issues in individual client clinics 
When a clinic operates in a community legal centre setting, it is in the 
nature of the work that issues of access to justice arise daily, with almost 
every client who comes in the door. As a result, clinics offer students a 
powerful opportunity to analyse the &lsquo;justice&rsquo; dimensions of law, ranging 
from the relationship between law and the perceived justice of its effect, 
to a lawyer&rsquo;s ethical obligations to achieve what a client wants as a &lsquo;just&rsquo; 
result, to systemic questions about access to law and legal services. These 
are especially rich opportunities for reflective practice (see Chapter 7).
</p>
<p>Students who work with poor and disadvantaged clients learn some of the 
issues these people face. As well as seeing individual problems, students 
can begin to see that a person&rsquo;s legal problem may be a product of external 
factors, such as poverty.94 Students are frequently taught to solve complex 
problems, as the issues that clients present are multilayered and are rarely 
solely &lsquo;legal&rsquo;, as we discussed in relation to multidisciplinary clinics above.
</p>
<p>Questions of the relationship between law and justice arise, for example, in 
public housing cases where the housing department, the community and 
various residents will each have their own&mdash;and often very different&mdash;idea 
of what a &lsquo;just&rsquo; outcome will be. As well as reflecting on these differences, 
students can consider the role of the lawyer and related ethical issues, 
such as reconciling their own values with what their client wants as a &lsquo;just&rsquo; 
result. For example, a client who is unhappy with the loud use of television 
by a public housing neighbour may want their neighbour to be evicted 
or transferred. Giving advice to the client will involve explaining the law 
and its limitations for dealing with neighbour disputes in public housing

<p>estates. Debriefing with a student afterwards would involve a discussion 
of the role of public housing, how it is organised and its scarcity, the 
number of people living with mental illness and psychiatric disability in 
public housing, and the justice of a remedy that sees the eviction of a 
mentally ill public housing tenant. Different understandings of justice 
and social justice are inherent in ethical paradigms of lawyering raised by 
the scenario, discussed above. 
</p>
<p>The role of a clinic as a service provider will itself raise systemic questions 
about access to justice, for example, about available alternative services 
(private, public, legal and non-legal), about accessibility (geography, 
physical, cultural, language, etc) and about public policy (state funding, 
professional oversight, etc). Within the work of a clinic based in a 
community legal centre or legal aid organisation, questions of access to 
justice attach to almost every client, inviting students to reflect on, for 
example, why the legal needs of a client and a community are not being 
met, or how they can be better met. 
</p>
<p>Justice issues in dispute resolution 
clinical courses 
Particular clinical courses can examine more explicitly &lsquo;how&rsquo; the legal 
system resolves disputes. Concepts of justice are, for example, explored 
in clinical dispute resolution courses where the practice of mediation 
or forms of dispute resolution other than litigation offer a means of 
critiquing courts as a legal dispute resolution mechanism. These clinical 
courses enable students to question adversarial approaches to dispute 
resolution that are reinforced in their legal studies through a case method 
of teaching. Macquarie University, for example, involves students in 
family dispute resolution mediation in a clinical course it runs with 
Macquarie Legal Centre.95 Clinical courses at Griffith University involve 
a partnership with the Department of Justice that provides students 
with opportunities to complete a placement with Queensland&rsquo;s major 
mediation service provider. Complemented by a focused classroom 
component (see&nbsp; Chapter&nbsp; 4), a&nbsp; clinical placement such as this enables

<p>exploration of ways in which power is used within negotiation and 
mediation.96 At the same time, the students&rsquo; observation of the different 
role of a mediator is an opportunity for the perspective transformation 
we discussed above. The mediation process offers a critical perspective on 
both the conventional ethical paradigm of adversarial lawyering and the 
&lsquo;just&rsquo; operation of law and legal processes.

<p>Justice issues in community 
engagement clinics
Clinical courses that do not have individuals as clients present students with 
a different approach to issues of lawyers, law and social justice. Different 
forms of community engagement enable students to see the systemic 
problems, legal and non-legal, in a community, and encourage them to 
analyse systemic issues as well as address the needs of a client.97 Such 
clinics focus on community legal education, community development 
and law reform, each of which is discussed below.
</p>
<p>It has been argued that a one-to-one individual client experience is 
essential for a student to have a &lsquo;transformative&rsquo;98 experience, to encounter 
that &lsquo;disorienting moment&rsquo;99 that can, with supervision and good 
reflective practice, fundamentally shift a student&rsquo;s perception of the law 
and legal system. There is, however, no empirical research that compares 
approaches in a controlled manner, and no way currently to prove or 
disprove this assertion. Whatever the merits of seeking the disorienting 
moment, community engagement offers something else to students: they 
work at a systemic level, focusing on larger issues that affect an individual 
and working for a different type of legal response. This is as valid and

legal education, enabling students to analyse and critique law from the 
perspective of disadvantaged clients and communities.100 
</p>
<p>Community legal education 
A distinctive feature of community legal centres is their commitment to 
community legal education as a means of promoting access to justice. 
Through plain language materials and active engagement with the 
community, community legal education aims to empower people so they 
can engage effectively with the law that affects them.101 Community legal 
education enables law students to understand how a lawyer can &lsquo;journey 
with the community&rsquo;: 
</p>
<p>This journey has to involve the community really getting a sense of who 
they are, in the sense of beginning to understand their own power. In 
working with community, the wisdom or the knowledge of the lawyer 
does not outweigh the wisdom and knowledge of the community, about 
itself especially &hellip;102 
</p>
<p>Community legal education, as a dimension of a clinic, offers students 
an opportunity to examine the way law affects people and how they can 
respond, and to think critically about the different ways that a lawyer 
can work to promote access to justice. Students in the UNSW clinic 
at Kingsford Legal Centre, for example, run family law community

<p>Law reform
With the growth in clinical externships, many universities offering clinical 
courses include the option of clinical externships at policy agencies, 
including law reform commissions.113 While law reform work is not always 
aimed directly at improving the lives of disadvantaged communities and 
their access to justice, many of the approaches to law reform do have 
that as one of their goals; a clinic may be law reform&ndash;focused, but we 
cannot assume that it has specific social justice goals. An externship at a 
law reform commission is a good way of teaching students the processes 
of law reform, because it allows students a close-up view of how policy 
is developed, of the choices a government must make, and of the ways 
in which law reform issues are prioritised.114 At the same time, there is 
considerable value in integrating law reform activity with individual client 
work115 and community development. 
</p>
<p>Conclusion
There is a profound and longstanding connection between Australian 
clinical legal education and social justice. Unlike in the United States, there 
is in Australia no dichotomy between teaching social justice and teaching 
skills in clinics. This integration is a significant positive characteristic 
of Australian clinics, creating many opportunities for teaching students 
about lawyering towards social justice. A diverse range of clinics teach 
ideas, values, skills and ethics of justice, through individual client work, 
specialist clinics, and innovative models such as multidisciplinary and

<p>supervision
</p>
<p>Introduction
In this chapter, we address the central role of effective supervision in 
enabling law students to make the most of the learning opportunities 
presented by clinic-based experiences.1 Clinical methods will not achieve 
their potential without effective supervision tailored to each student and 
to the particular objectives set for the clinical experience. Supervision 
also needs to address the legal and related needs of the clients served 
by the clinic, ensuring their interests are safeguarded and advanced. 
External placement arrangements raise particular supervision issues in 
terms of balancing the needs of the host organisation, its clients and the 
participating students. 
</p>
<p>A range of difficulties is likely to be generated by inadequate student 
supervision. Without clear guidance and support, students will struggle to 
appreciate the complexities and practicalities of the environment in which 
they are working. Clients may suffer, with students failing to gather key 
information and address all of the legal issues. Students may also suffer if 
they are dealing with particularly challenging matters. Students will not

<p>be able to learn so readily as they would from the example of an effective 
supervisor, and may adopt poor practices without recognising the need to 
change their approach. Without clear and supportive supervision, students 
may not benefit from receiving feedback and are unlikely to develop 
reflective practices. The confidence that builds from being effectively 
supported and appropriately challenged is critical to clinic students. 
</p>
<p>While the clinical legal education literature emphasises the importance 
of effective supervision, there is a need to further deepen the shared 
understanding of what supervision practices support the achievement 
of particular learning objectives. Our Best Practices research revealed 
a genuine interest among both in-house and external supervisors 
for practical insights about how to make their supervision efforts as 
constructive as possible for all involved. The project also revealed that 
supervision arrangements are often underdeveloped, relying on untested 
assumptions about the effectiveness of legal practice supervision models 
in clinic contexts.2 
</p>
<p>Supervision appears to be the issue most in need of close attention. 
Those&nbsp; involved in clinical programs acknowledged the limits of their 
knowledge of how to make the most effective use of clinic-based student 
learning. The recognition of the importance of quality supervision needs 
to be matched by a greater focus on what that means and how it can be 
fostered. Quality controls of supervision are limited. 
</p>
<p>Our research identified differences in the ways externship programs are 
constructed with &lsquo;what we might think of as the essential features of the 
clinical method&mdash;supervision, responsibility and reflection&rsquo; being &lsquo;present 
to different degrees, and at times &hellip; absent&rsquo;.3 Student supervisors describe 
&lsquo;varying understanding of teaching concepts such as problem based 
learning, scaffolding for student learning and student responsibility and 
autonomy&rsquo;, and all supervisors said that &lsquo;the client or service needs will 
trump student or pedagogical needs&rsquo;.4 We found that:

</p>
<p>a significant area where most law schools seem to have a clear quality 
deficit concerns training of clinical supervisors, in either live client or 
externship/placement contexts. As far as we can tell, there is currently no 
requirement for such supervisors to hold a higher education certificate or 
equivalent.5 
</p>
<p>Our survey of staff involved in Australian clinical programs showed 
clear recognition of the need for effective supervision, while also 
demonstrating a lack of clarity about the processes that would best be 
used to improve supervision standards. With the student and other 
workloads that some supervisors are expected to carry, it is unrealistic 
to expect in-depth supervision tailored to each student. If programs rely 
on external supervisors, then the law school needs to prioritise preparing 
and resourcing them effectively. This is especially so when the supervisor 
is involved in the student assessment process. While most programs 
provide supervisors with written guidelines, it was acknowledged in 
the survey responses that a deeper form of ongoing engagement and 
professional development is required for supervisors to understand and 
promote consistent practices.6 We found that &lsquo;[t]here was a clear desire 
for supervisors to have access to their own supervision and support&rsquo; and 
that &lsquo;such supervision should include training in education theories and 
skills as well as ongoing professional development in their area of law. 
There also seemed to be a&nbsp;desire for more opportunities to discuss and to 
workshop supervision and clinical practice generally&rsquo;.7
</p>
<p>Further, our survey revealed innovative practices involving senior 
in-house&nbsp; clinic students mentoring junior students involved in a 
preliminary placement. Law schools involved in external placement 
programs identified the need for administrative support to enable 
placements to work effectively. However, there appears to be limited 
law school recognition of the resource implications for community 
organisations of supervising students. Building strong relationships with 
the organisations that are hosting students is recognised as important to 
the ongoing functioning of placement programs. Our research confirmed

<p>that it will be important for the partners to develop realistic expectations 
of what can be achieved through such partnerships and the need to 
adequately support and resource such collaborations.8 It also emphasised 
the benefits of strong relationships in supporting student learning in 
externship programs.9
</p>
<p>The supervision terrain is uneven by reason of the diversity of clinical 
arrangements in place&mdash;different models, different objectives, different 
students and different sites. Online supervision can add further variation 
to the mix. Clinical supervision involves responsibility for client work 
being shared to some degree with the student for the purpose of student 
learning. Chavkin emphasises that the process involves supervision rather 
than direction: &lsquo;Students need to invest in the quality of their decisions 
and this process is facilitated by having supervisors help students reflect 
on their experiences and not by displacing students as the lawyers for 
their clients.&rsquo;10 This clearly distinguishes the clinic setting from other 
legal practices where supervisors delegate work to less senior lawyers 
and paralegals, largely because of pressure of business and to maximise 
fee generation. The legal work required by a client can almost always be 
done more quickly and more effectively by an experienced lawyer than by 
a&nbsp;student.11 
</p>
<p>In their review of the substantial literature on supervision in health-related 
disciplines, Kilminster and Jolly describe clinical supervision as a &lsquo;complex 
activity, occurring in a variety of settings, [with] various definitions, 
functions and modes of delivery&rsquo;.12 The literature on legal professional 
supervision is relatively underdeveloped, focusing on risk management

<p>This chapter considers the changing dynamics of supervision in law firms 
and the key supervision issues facing clinical programs. The chapter 
also considers the potential for clinical programs to foster &lsquo;reciprocal 
professional development&rsquo;, which addresses the reciprocal nature of 
supervision arrangements and the potential for clinic students to learn 
from the experience of others.13 If clinical programs are to consolidate their 
foothold in the legal academy, then they need to articulate the benefits 
supervisors can draw from their work with students. This is particularly 
so for external placement arrangements, discussed in Chapter 3. Students 
involved in external placements can also benefit from group sessions 
that allow them to share and make sense of their respective experiences, 
identifying common experiences and points of difference. Having 
considered the professional and educational contexts in which clinical 
supervision takes place, we then provide practical guidance and support 
for supervisors, students and those responsible for clinical programs to 
make their efforts as constructive as possible. We set out both principles 
and practices designed to foster best practices in clinical supervision. 
</p>
<p>Supporting and challenging students 
through supervision
Effective clinical supervision is not a straightforward process. It relies on 
an elusive set of skills from both education and legal practice. The nature 
and style of supervision required depends on the students involved, what 
they have already learnt, and what they are expected to learn from the 
particular experiences in question. If the learning objectives for a clinic are 
general in nature, and relate to the students&rsquo; developing an understanding 
of the dynamics of law-related processes and workplaces, then the 
</p>
<p>13  The concept of reciprocal professional development is being examined as part of an Australian 
Office for Learning and Teaching National Teaching Fellowship, awarded to Jeff Giddings to assist 
Australian legal education providers to make informed choices about the design and delivery of 
experiential learning opportunities, and to enhance the supervision of law students in practice contexts 
by focusing on the dynamic that enables both students and their practitioner teachers to benefit from 
the collaborative nature of practice-based learning. See www.olt.gov.au/olt-national-teaching-fellow-

</p>
<p>supervision the student receives will be particularly important. Without 
effective supervision, the richness of real client clinic environments in 
particular is unlikely to be harnessed effectively. Students may well fail 
to appreciate what they are experiencing unless their supervisor guides 
and fosters such appreciation. Students also require feedback about 
their performances, both in terms of &lsquo;what conduct is inappropriate 
(and requires avoidance) and what conduct is acceptable (and deserves 
repeating)&rsquo;.14 Stuckey and others refer to the theory of &lsquo;frustrated non-
reward&rsquo;&mdash;that the lack of reward where reward is expected has an &lsquo;adverse 
effect much like punishment&rsquo;&mdash;and&nbsp; suggest that this &lsquo;places a heavy 
burden on the clinician to give effective feedback and to reinforce good 
performance&rsquo;.15 The expertise, roles and priorities of the supervisor are 
likely to vary considerably among different clinical models. 
</p>
<p>Developing an environment in which students feel both suitably supported 
and challenged is a key aspect of the work of supervisors. Barry refers to 
the risks involved in clinical supervision as including the:
</p>
<p>risk of destroying confidence in the very attempt of building it. The risk of 
allowing creative tension to dissolve into hostility. The risk of permitting 
clinic precepts of social justice, commitment and professionalism to 
deconstruct into alienation, intolerance and mediocre performance.16
</p>
<p>Developing such an environment is also what makes clinical teaching 
more expensive than lecture- and seminar-based teaching methods. 
Efforts by law schools to cut the cost of providing clinical experiences 
have often focused on limiting direct supervision and having each 
supervisor responsible for greater numbers of students. Others have 
involved increased reliance on placements in external organisations 
with supervisors whose principal responsibility is not student learning. 
While the move to external placements raises supervision challenges, it 
also presents law schools with opportunities to offer students a broader 
range of placement options and the ability to engage with the practising 
profession, providing professional development for external supervisors.17

</p>
<p>It is important to consider how law students can most constructively 
share and learn from their respective placement experiences through the 
classroom component of their studies. As is the case in other forms of 
experiential education, clinicians take a purposeful approach to teaching 
students how to learn from their experience.&nbsp;Issues related to the training 
of external supervisors need to be addressed along with the roles that 
can best be played by mentoring and coaching arrangements. Clinical 
supervisors can make an important contribution by preparing students to 
approach supervision in a constructive manner. Ryan Cole and Wortham 
have helpfully provided guidance to students on how they can learn from 
supervision.18 They note the need for clinical legal education students 
to develop their ability to &lsquo;be a good supervisee&rsquo;: anticipating supervisor 
questions, understanding when to seek clarification and recognising when 
to exercise greater autonomy. 
</p>
<p>Supervision in legal workplaces 
Supervision arrangements and practices in legal workplaces can influence 
clinic student supervision in a range of ways. We noted in Chapter 2 that 
there is growing reliance on external supervisors working with students. 
Legal practitioners tend to begin supervising students with little in the 
way of training and guidance and are often guided in their approach by 
their own experiences of workplace supervision.
</p>
<p>Given the importance of supervision in modern legal practice, it is 
surprising that the literature on legal professional supervision more 
generally is underdeveloped, focusing on risk management dimensions.19 
While risk management is a key consideration, other important supervision 
dimensions include:
</p>
<p>&bull; enhancing quality&mdash;accuracy, timeliness, value for money, ethical 
soundness, suitability for task;
</p>
<p>&bull; mentoring junior staff;

<p>The structures used by law firms to manage their work and meet their 
professional responsibilities have always been underpinned by supervision 
arrangements.20 Partners and senior lawyers take responsibility for the 
work of junior and trainee lawyers as well as paralegals. There is an ongoing 
expectation that law graduates will do a lot of their practical learning once 
they start work, yet the supervision that is crucial in supporting new and 
inexperienced practitioners appears to be increasingly difficult to secure. 
</p>
<p>As we noted in Chapter 2, the numbers of law schools and law students 
have both grown significantly since the Dawkins reforms of the late 
1980s; in 1987 there were 12 law schools in Australia and in 2015 there 
were 40.21 Those law schools are graduating students in much greater 
numbers. There have also been dramatic changes in the professional 
training required of law graduates prior to admission to legal practice. 
Across Australia, the traditional articles of clerkship have been replaced 
with practical legal training (PLT) programs (offered by law schools or 
private providers) and workplace traineeships.22 While these PLT programs 
provide considerable educational advantages, the placement experiences 
offered to students vary considerably in terms of duration and nature and 
have not been effectively integrated with other program components. 
The opportunities for law graduates to participate in a closely supervised 
transition to professional practice have reduced.23

<p>6 . The imPoRTAnCe of effeCTive SUPeRviSion
</p>
<p>The emergence of national law firms and, over the past decade, the 
internationalisation and the digitisation of legal practice, have further 
challenged the traditional supervisory structures. Dramatic increases in the 
size of law firms have meant that supervision has become more important 
than ever, yet close supervision is less readily available to law graduates. 
Some law graduates seek to enter their chosen profession with little in 
the way of direct experience of legal work. These changes make clinical 
supervision practices increasingly important in shaping the expectations 
of law graduates entering the legal profession.
</p>
<p>While experiential learning opportunities have become more prominent 
in some law schools, the pedagogy informing these programs requires 
further development. As our Best Practices research revealed, the models 
used vary considerably, as do the supervision processes.24 Despite this 
greater prominence, many Australian law students remain unable to 
access clinical programs because of the high staff&ndash;student ratios required 
for practice-based learning. In an effort to reduce costs, some law schools 
have relied on unpaid external supervision. While external placements have 
great potential to provide students with excellent learning opportunities, 
this requires careful structuring in terms of the supervision arrangements 
and the classroom component linked to the placement.25 
</p>
<p>Clinical programs and their academics involved in supervision (whether 
directly supervising students or managing other supervisors) can make 
a significant contribution by developing their understanding of how 
effective supervision underpins learning in the clinic, and implementing 
more effective practices. This can set the scene for promoting best practices 
in the supervision of law graduates once they leave the clinic environment.

<p>How supervision underpins learning 
in the clinic
Student supervision is a hallmark of clinical legal education. It should 
be understood as directly related to the design and implementation of 
objectives for a clinical course. Close supervision of students is significant 
in providing the scaffolding that enables novices to further develop their 
professional skills: 
</p>
<p>By making explicit important features of good performance through 
various conceptual models and representations, teachers can guide the 
learner in mastering complex knowledge by small steps. These devices of 
representation serve as scaffolds (in the language of learning theorists) to 
support efforts at improved performance.26 
</p>
<p>Quigley refers to insights from Sch&ouml;n, Dewey and Brookfield in 
identifying that the clinic setting facilitates experiential learning because it 
provides structured opportunities to learn by reflecting on the experience 
provided.27 The relationship between a student and their supervisor is 
central to structuring the learning process. The process can challenge 
students because they are required to &lsquo;begin to practice before they 
know everything &hellip; a difficult and scary process that requires honest 
and searching inquiry about paths taken and mistakes made&rsquo;.28 Reflective 
practice is also considered central to professional development in other 
disciplines, although &lsquo;total reliance on reflection may not always be 
appropriate in supervision because beginners need direction&rsquo;.29 Quigley 
states: &lsquo;Adults&rsquo; capacity for self-direction is dependent on their ability to 
be self-aware and to reflect on the implications of their experiences for 
future action.&rsquo;30

<p>Effective supervision can also reveal the range of uncertainties that legal 
professionals must address in their work. This includes uncertainty as to 
what has taken place and why, whether a client&rsquo;s account is likely to be 
accepted by relevant third parties, which legal doctrines are relevant to the 
issues facing the client, and how those doctrines are likely to apply. Assisting 
students to develop the ability to deal with unstructured situations has 
been identified as a key objective of live client clinical courses.31 
</p>
<p>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching&rsquo;s 2007 
Educating Lawyers Report (the Carnegie Report) observed that the 
mark of professional expertise is &lsquo;the ability to both act and think well 
in uncertain situations&rsquo;,32 and recognised clinics as enabling the features 
of a practice environment to be revealed in simplified ways that can be 
understood by novice practitioners &lsquo;who can begin to develop their own 
perception and judgment&rsquo;.33 Milstein describes the contribution of clinics 
in developing the strategic planning skills of lawyers, involving &lsquo;making 
decisions about taking action or withholding action in order to maximise 
the likelihood of achieving the goals&rsquo; of the client. &lsquo;The real-world setting 
of the clinic forces students to engage in the complexity of analysis that is 
inherent when the multiple actors who affect outcomes are identified.&rsquo; 34 
Supervisors should emphasise to students the importance of safeguarding 
client interests, and should talk through the processes used to provide 
advice that enables clients to make decisions.

of&nbsp;practice contexts for fostering ethics-related learning:

</p>
<p>Decades of pedagogical experimentation in clinical-legal teaching, the 
example of other professional schools and contemporary learning theory 
all point toward the value of clinical education as a site for developing not 
only intellectual understanding and complex skills of practice but also the 
dispositions crucial for legal professionalism.35 
</p>
<p>Supervisors are central to harnessing the rich possibilities in the clinical 
environment, and should consider ethical issues as they arise with reference 
to the range of available frameworks.36 Supervisors can also foster student 
critical analysis and awareness of a wide range of social justice issues.37 
While such teaching takes time, it can be immensely valuable to talk 
issues through with students. 
</p>
<p>Clinical supervision can highlight to students the importance of 
collaborative frameworks in legal practice. Students can develop their 
awareness of the team-based work performed by many modern lawyers 
and of the value of developing working relationships with mentors. 
For&nbsp;these reasons, supervisors need to demonstrate and model collaborative 
approaches in their work with students. 
</p>
<p>Supervision arrangements in 
Australian clinics 
As we described in Chapter 5, a key driver in the development of the 
first Australian clinics was community service. As had happened 
elsewhere, student involvement in voluntary legal advice programs gave 
rise to clinical programs at Monash and La Trobe universities and at the 
University of New South Wales (UNSW).38 There was a strong focus

<p>on community service and, quite understandably, limited attention was 
given to supervision and other arrangements designed to foster student 
learning.39 
</p>
<p>The fledgling Monash Law School clinical program drew on the experiences 
of the first Australian community legal centres that developed in the 
early 1970s. It developed a diffuse structure that generated supervision 
challenges. The substantial responsibility given to student volunteers and 
the involvement of a significant number of part-time supervisors resulted 
in tensions. In 1979 to 1980, the Monash University clinical program had 
involved 11 supervisors across three sites and faced challenges related to 
different approaches to supervision and a lack of shared understandings as 
to the extent of the responsibility expected of the predominantly part-time 
supervisors.40 There was a move to a more coherent program in the 1980s 
with the appointment of staff focused on the clinic but then challenges 
arose in terms of retaining those people. The commitment to community 
service exemplified by the &lsquo;no appointment needed&rsquo; structure of client 
sessions at Springvale Legal Service, the main Monash clinic site, fostered 
what Evans subsequently described as a superficial file-handling culture 
among students that presented major challenges for their supervisors.41 
</p>
<p>The clinical program established in the Legal Studies Department at 
La&nbsp;Trobe University in the late 1970s focused on client-service concerns 
in its initial years. Kevin Bell, the solicitor responsible for the La Trobe 
clinical program from 1981 to 1985, noted the complexity for a clinic 
in balancing &lsquo;three competing policy priorities&rsquo;&mdash;casework, community 
action and legal education&mdash;and indicated that student needs were not 
prominent in casework selection decisions. Bell stated: 
</p>
<p>The educational needs of the students did not figure highly in decisions 
made about whether a case was picked up or not. The focus was on the 
needs of the client, what we could do for them with the limited resources 
we had and whether or not a particular case was worthy of our follow up or 
personal attention because it had consequences beyond the immediate.42

</p>
<p>The clinic at UNSW emphasised direct supervision of students with 
supervisors attending with the student to provide advice at the first 
interview. Founding Kingsford Legal Centre (KLC) Director, Neil Rees, 
had worked most recently for Aboriginal Legal Services where there was 
a focus on providing the best quality of service, and where there was 
also considerable scepticism about student involvement in casework 
delivery. In hindsight, he acknowledges that he contributed to KLC&rsquo;s 
strong emphasis on service delivery, which may have come at some cost 
to student&nbsp;learning.43 
</p>
<p>An interesting divide has developed among the Australian clinical programs 
in relation to the provision of advice to the client once the student and 
supervisor have determined what advice is to be provided to the client.44 
When a client is interviewed for the first time at either the UNSW or 
University of Newcastle clinic, the student takes instructions. Once the 
student and the supervisor have settled on the advice to be given, the 
solicitor gives advice to the client with the student present and recording 
that advice. Clinical programs outside New South Wales have tended to 
use the approach developed at Monash whereby the student, after taking 
the client&rsquo;s instructions and consulting with the supervisor, returns to the 
client and advises them, unaccompanied by their supervisor. All programs 
share a similar approach to preparing students for their involvement in 
interviewing clients: in the first weeks of their placement, students observe 
interviews conducted by their supervisor and/or former students and are 
then involved in intensive seminars using simulations to develop their 
interviewing and advising skills. Such a model allows very competent 
students to perform to their capacity as opposed to some artificially lower 
level of responsibility. 
</p>
<p>The focus on client service of Australia&rsquo;s early clinical programs is now 
shared by more recently established programs. Well-established programs 
have had more opportunity to develop ways in which they can use 
supervision and clinic design to effectively integrate service and learning

develop suitable supervision arrangements that foster reflective practices 
and harness the learning potential of clinical legal education. 
</p>
<p>Key issues in clinical supervision
In this section, we address what we have identified as key issues in 
the supervision of students involved in a range of clinic placements. 
Particular&nbsp; challenges arise when arrangements result in supervision 
resources being spread too thinly or in not maintaining sufficient focus 
on student&nbsp;learning. 
</p>
<p>Supervision ratios
The intense nature of clinic-based learning requires a limit on the number 
of students with whom each supervisor works. Staff&ndash;student ratios that 
enable the provision of close feedback on student performance appear to be 
an important indicator of the durability of a clinical program. Such ratios 
need to be set at realistic levels and then not increased significantly over 
time. Chavkin refers to students&rsquo; needing the opportunity to &lsquo;regularly 
interact with their supervisors in a setting in which faculty members 
have sufficient time and energy to discuss case-related and personal issues 
with their students in a non-directive manner&rsquo;. He argues this requires 
a&nbsp;student&ndash;supervisor ratio of no more than 8:1 where students are engaged 
in delivering casework services in collaboration with their supervisor and 
colleagues.45 
</p>
<p>Holland&rsquo;s account of the Yale clinical program refers to &lsquo;the Spring from 
hell&rsquo; in 1989 with too many students to permit effective supervision. 
This&nbsp; led to changes and the adoption in 1992 of an in-house student-
clinic supervisor ratio of between 8:1 and 10:1.46 Wilson refers to student&ndash;
supervisor ratios at the Catholic University of Chile having started in 
1970 at 8:1 but, by 2000, having risen to 17:1 due to the popularity of

<p>the clinic and no additional clinicians being hired.47 In 2008, du Plessis 
wrote of clinicians at the University of the Witwatersrand Law Clinic in 
Johannesburg, South Africa, each supervising between 38 and 46 students 
as compared to the recommended ratio of 12:1.48 Workloads of this kind 
challenge both the learning of students and the longevity of supervisors.
</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the Warwick clinical program shifted from real client to 
being predominantly simulation-based, in part because of supervision 
concerns. &lsquo;Supervising the number of cases that became necessary to 
provide an adequate caseload for the increased number of students was 
not possible without a large increase in staff.&rsquo;49 Consistency of supervision 
was also an issue for the Warwick program, which had developed from 
a&nbsp;volunteer student service with supervisors taking different approaches 
to their work.50
</p>
<p>While Australia&rsquo;s pioneering clinical legal educators faced some heavy 
supervision loads, the survey we conducted indicates that current 
supervision loads are more manageable. Student&ndash;supervisor ratios are 
generally around 6:1 or 8:1 for clinics involving engagement in client 
casework. In several regions, such as Queensland, Victoria and South 
Australia, there is a considerable consistency in supervision ratios across 
clinical programs. The highest ratios were recorded for clinical activities 
not involving direct client casework. In Victoria, the Victoria University 
placement program involves one academic supervisor for 30 students.51 
In Queensland, one QUT virtual clinic involves 20 students for one 
supervisor, while the Griffith Street Law clinic has 14 students working 
with the one supervisor.52

</p>
<p>Containing the service imperative
Clinics around the globe have faced sustained challenges in balancing the 
needs of students with client demands for legal services.53 These challenges 
are significant in Australia too, and it is important for law schools that are 
developing clinical programs to understand the potential of using clinical 
methods and to learn from the experiences of existing clinics.
</p>
<p>In one of the most effective accounts of this issue, Redlich wrote of his 
experiences in 1969&ndash;70 in running a &lsquo;relatively large service-oriented 
clinical program&rsquo; at the University of Wisconsin, describing &lsquo;many 
unsatisfactory experiences&rsquo; resulting from the variable nature of student 
supervision provided by the lawyers working in the host legal aid office.54 
Lack of experience left the staff attorneys unable to supervise, so that 
students were left to seek supervision elsewhere.55 Some students did 
excellent work with effective supervision, but others &lsquo;came and went as 
they wished and abandoned files were common&rsquo;.56 
</p>
<p>Redlich reports that while some students &lsquo;enjoyed the freedom to make 
decisions, give advice, and, to a high degree, practice law independently, 
others recognized that the clients and occasionally they, too, were being 
imposed upon&rsquo;.57 He suggests that many problems appeared unique to 
that type of placement. This experience can usefully be contrasted with the 
positive experience at the University of Minnesota described by George 
Grossman, who tells how the in-house clinic avoided the downsides 
associated with service-oriented clinics by careful planning and by keeping 
the initial educational goals relatively modest. Caseloads were limited, 
cases were selected to suit the clinic&rsquo;s purposes and close supervision was 
maintained. As the program became established, it gained momentum 
with non-clinic faculty members involving themselves in supervision in 
their fields of expertise.58

<p>The Monash University clinical program developed out of a telephone 
referral service involving students taking calls from people seeking legal 
assistance. Once a problem was identified, the student telephoned 
a member of Monash academic staff for advice and referral and these 
details were then conveyed to the original caller. Simon Smith was one 
of the participating students and subsequently became Australia&rsquo;s first 
clinical legal academic. Smith refers to the students receiving &lsquo;no formal 
preparation or immediate professional supervision &hellip; The academic 
advisers were even less regulated. The success of the telephone call for 
a&nbsp;client entirely depended on who answered the phone&rsquo;.59
</p>
<p>Concerns arise when those advocating the importance and value of 
student pro bono schemes demonstrate a limited understanding of the 
importance of effective supervision and structure in enabling students to 
maximise their learning from clinical experiences.60 In writing about the 
emergence of Pro Bono Students Australia at the University of Western 
Sydney, Sappideen and Cingiloglu emphasise the contributions of 
students in the governance and delivery of projects. They refer to a part-
time student coordinator having responsibility for activities including 
recruitment of volunteer students, advertising, coordination, evaluation 
and, perhaps most significantly, supervision.61 This suggests a failure to 
fully appreciate the importance of close and supportive expert supervision 
in enabling students to draw useful insights from experience, and seems 
to underestimate the complexity of legal issues that arise in the context 
of&nbsp;pro bono legal work.
</p>
<p>Reflecting on his experiences in developing extra-curricular student clinics 
at the Universities of Bristol and Strathclyde, Nicolson emphasises the 
validity of community service as a focus for clinical programs. Nicolson 
considers service-focused clinics to be more valuable in terms of both the 
services provided and avoidance of the problematic messages students 
absorb in education-focused clinics that prioritise student learning over 
community need.62 A weakness in Nicolson&rsquo;s argument is his apparent

<p>failure to recognise the importance of effective supervision in ensuring 
the quality of services delivered to the community and in providing 
students with effective frameworks for reflecting on their experiences 
in&nbsp;clinic-based work. Nicolson states that close supervision of students in 
education-focused clinics should reduce the risk of mistakes by students, 
but then refers to the lack of instances in his 12 years of involvement 
in voluntary student programs where mistakes had been irreparable. 
He&nbsp;has subsequently written elsewhere, referring to educational theory 
that indicates that &lsquo;lessons learnt from experience are likely to be far more 
profound and sophisticated if accompanied by reflection on the experience 
through dialogue with others, especially those with relevant expertise and 
experience, and an exploration of the relevant academic literature&rsquo;.63
</p>
<p>Student supervisors in Australian clinical programs have tended to come 
to their work with very little training, and Giddings&rsquo; research has revealed 
that clinicians had limited understanding of the complexities of student 
supervision before becoming clinical supervisors.64 Legal practitioners 
who become involved in supervising students as part of an externship 
program are also likely to have received little or no preparation for student-
focused supervision. Supervisors with experience of client-focused legal 
practice are likely to find the transition to student-focused supervision 
easier to make. Clinical models involving provision of advice to clients 
require students to assume responsibility for their actions in a much more 
direct way than in other forms of legal education. In such programs, 
students are compelled to recognise that their actions will influence the 
wellbeing of&nbsp;others, namely their clients. &lsquo;It necessarily follows from the 
touchstone of &ldquo;realism&rdquo; that a student in role must bear responsibility for 
the resolution of the problem.&rsquo;65 This type of student development relies 
very heavily on supervision designed to support student autonomy.

</p>
<p>Developing student autonomy
Clinical experiences direct the student into relatively uncharted waters, 
but do so with support structures involving preliminary preparation and 
close supervision. As their skills and confidence develop, the student can 
be provided with opportunities to take greater control over their future 
learning as they test for themselves the best ways to approach issues and 
problems. This introduces students to the norms of current legal practice 
but also, importantly, assists them to develop a framework for how they 
will approach the need for ongoing learning and development throughout 
their professional life. 
</p>
<p>Pioneering Australian clinicians recognised the challenges generated by 
student supervision. In a 1984 paper, Robyn Lansdowne and Neil Rees 
described their supervision of students involved in the clinical course at 
UNSW as involving:
</p>
<p>[the] difficult task of leading students to believe that they must accept 
responsibility for the conduct of a particular case whilst at the same time 
ensuring that our clients are not disadvantaged in any way by student 
involvement. In part, we have to create an illusion of responsibility.66
</p>
<p>They had earlier referred to their approach to supervision as being &lsquo;akin 
to placing students on a rope. The rope is gradually let out if a student 
is performing well. If a student fails to perform adequately we are forced 
to draw in the rope and explore every minor detail of a case with the 
student&rsquo;.67
</p>
<p>In 1987 Simon Smith drew on more than a decade of experience 
supervising in the Monash clinical program to provide a very effective 
description of the clinician&rsquo;s supervisory role:
</p>
<p>Whilst on the one hand the teacher is endeavouring to develop a diagnostic/
problem solving ability it has to be tempered with a benevolent power of 
instant veto. The supervising responsibility is a subtle animal. Exercised 
too harshly it can crush the student. Exercised too loosely then the client 
can suffer. In no other law subject is this the case. In other subjects the 
equation is simpler &ndash; &lsquo;the student stuffs up, the student fails&rsquo;!68

<p>6 . The imPoRTAnCe of effeCTive SUPeRviSion
</p>
<p>Supervision issues generated disagreement in the United States in the 
1990s among the advocates of different clinical models, particularly 
between those endorsing externships and those supportive of in-house 
clinics. Divergent views have been taken of the particular benefits students 
derive from being supervised by a practitioner-academic rather than by 
an external person who, while often having lengthy practice experience, 
must prioritise other responsibilities and may have little experience in 
working supportively with students. This tension is usefully highlighted 
in the 1991 American Association of Law Schools Committee Report 
that noted: &lsquo;There is a marked difference in how schools rated the level of 
extern supervision. Schools without in-house clinics tended to rate their 
level of extern supervision as high, while schools that had in-house clinics 
most frequently rated extern supervision as low.&rsquo;69 
</p>
<p>Various explanations are given for these variations, the most interesting 
being that they &lsquo;represent self-serving statements on both sides, with 
schools having in-house clinics minimizing the supervision offered to 
externs, while schools without in-house clinics seek to defend externships 
as a viable alternative&rsquo;.70
</p>
<p>Givelber and others question the significance of academic supervision of 
clinic students. On the basis of their analysis of the &lsquo;co-op&rsquo; externships 
program at Northeastern University, they argue:
</p>
<p>the nature and intensity of the work are at least as important as any 
aspect of supervision in explaining what distinguishes a good learning 
environment. This finding challenges one of the bedrock assumptions of 
clinical methodology&mdash;the centrality of an intensive, education-focused 
supervisory relationship.71 
</p>
<p>Further, they insist that there is &lsquo;absolutely no empirical support&rsquo; for 
the notion that learning can occur only where a professional educator 
is present.72 They found that &lsquo;both the characteristics of the job and the 
presence of supervision play important roles in students&rsquo; evaluations of 
their work experiences&rsquo;.73

<p>Givelber and others found that &lsquo;busy hands correlate[d] most significantly 
with a high rating&rsquo; from students of their externship placement &lsquo;as a 
learning experience&rsquo;.74 Their survey notes that the statistically significant 
negative factors included students finding it difficult to clarify the nature 
of the work assigned to them, mismatches of skills and responsibilities, 
and the failure to honour mutual expectations.75 They suggest that good 
supervision is not enough and that it is also necessary for students to 
receive both written and oral feedback, and to be productively engaged 
throughout their placement, avoiding idle time.76 Our response is that 
all of these characteristics should be viewed as coming within a broad 
definition of supervision that is applicable to those clinical experiences, 
whether supervised by academics or by other practitioners. 
</p>
<p>English clinical scholar Hugh Brayne has candidly outlined how he 
changed his approach to sitting in on student interviews with clients.77 
For his first four years as a clinical supervisor, Brayne &lsquo;sat in on every 
student interview&rsquo;, thinking &lsquo;that I had a professional responsibility to 
do so&rsquo;. Subsequently, following discussions with clinicians in the United 
States, he almost never sat in on student&ndash;client interviews. He became 
concerned to avoid usurping the student&rsquo;s relationship with the client. 
Brayne considered that his previous approach had come from &lsquo;a failure to 
separate the two goals of legal service and student learning&rsquo;.78 
</p>
<p>Brayne&rsquo;s argument in favour of allowing students to conduct their 
interviews and provide advice without their supervisor present is 
persuasive. However, the best model no doubt depends on the individuals 
involved, that is, both the supervisor and the student. Students who 
demonstrate the capacity for relatively independent work will benefit 
from opportunities to assume greater control over the advice process. 
The&nbsp; extent of preparation of students through other developmental 
activities will also be significant. Students should be prepared for their 
work with real clients by observing and discussing interviews, advocacy 
activities and other client work conducted by practitioners. New clinic 
students can also learn from experienced students and by participating in 
simulated activities on which they receive feedback. It may also be useful

For such a model to work, students need to be taught how to effectively

</p>
<p>Particular supervision issues generated 
by externships
While they have operated in Australia for a long time,79 externship 
and placement programs (discussed in Chapter 3) have become more 
organised and much more prominent in the last decade. This has meant 
that students are participating in the work of a much more diverse set 
of law-related workplaces. Further, the external supervisors may have 
received little in the way of training and guidance in relation to their role 
and are often juggling a broader set of priorities. Academic requirements 
linked to external placement programs also vary considerably in terms 
of who organises the placement, the work students do, and the related 
classroom component. 
</p>
<p>The variability of externship arrangements means that the preparation 
of both supervisors and students is particularly important. Law schools 
need to provide external supervisors with advice on what constitutes 
effective supervision of students, together with frameworks to help them 
implement that supervision advice. 
</p>
<p>Those responsible for such a program need to ensure that the relationship 
between each student, their supervisor and the law school is based on 
shared understandings and realistic expectations around what each party 
will contribute. This tends to be more challenging for externship programs 
than for other clinical models where the law school retains greater control 
over the educational experience. 
</p>
<p>Externship students need to appreciate that their opportunities to assume 
responsibility for legal work on behalf of clients are likely to be limited. 
They also need to be realistic about the access they can expect to have to 
their supervisor. It is important that supervisors recognise they are engaged 
in an educational endeavour that needs to balance student learning with 
client service. Externship programs will be more sustainable if law schools 
also recognise the need to appropriately resource externship programs,

</p>
<p>146
</p>
<p>especially in terms of preparing supervisors and developing an appropriate 
classroom program that enables students to share experiences and make 
sense of their placement experiences. 
</p>
<p>The greater variability of student experience that characterises externship 
programs presents interesting educational opportunities for students to 
learn as much as they can from the experiences of their colleagues as well 
as from their own placement work. In effect, there are two complementary 
learning environments&mdash;the placement site and the classroom&mdash;and 
supervision practices have a key role to play in revealing insights from how 
each student experiences their placement. Debriefing with both students 
and supervisors about their externship experiences will be important. 
</p>
<p>How law schools can promote 
effective&nbsp;supervision
Both the Australian and United States Best Practices guides (compared in 
Chapter 10) provide advice on the structures and processes law schools 
should use to foster effective supervision of clinic students. Recognising 
the time-consuming nature of student supervision is an important 
first step in building sustainable practices. The Australian Best Practices 
provides for supervision ratios of 4:1 per clinic advice session, with a limit 
of two sessions per supervisor in any given semester.80
</p>
<p>Many of the clinicians interviewed as part of our survey identified 
training of supervisors as an issue needing greater attention. Training 
programs tailored to the structures and priorities of the program 
should be delivered&nbsp; in ways that enable those involved to develop 
shared understandings and practices. The Australian Best Practices guide 
specifically addresses the particular needs for effective training and support 
for supervisors involved in external placement programs, emphasising the 
need for a&nbsp;shared commitment to meaningful liaison between academic 
staff and externship agency staff.81

</p>
<p>The United States Best Practices guide provides useful detail in relation 
to supervision, focusing on how supervisors can most productively 
provide feedback to students and how students can be prepared for 
receiving feedback.82 The framework set out in the report is particularly 
useful for new supervisors, and can provide a useful focus for discussion 
of&nbsp;supervision practices. 
</p>
<p>Close examination of the range of purposes of supervision will be useful 
in developing new ways for law students to constructively share and 
learn from their respective placement experiences through the classroom 
component of their clinical studies. As we noted above, clinicians take a 
purposeful approach to enabling students to learn how to learn from their 
experiences. Supervisors should be very clear about what the student is 
expected to learn from their clinical experience.83 A purposeful approach 
also involves working closely with students to foster their structured 
reflection on what they have experienced.84 Modelling reflective practices 
is an important way in which supervisors can assist students to understand 
how and why to use such processes. A purposeful approach further entails 
giving students multiple opportunities to incrementally develop the 
understandings and skills addressed by the clinical program. 
</p>
<p>Particular issues generated by 
online supervision
The use of online supervision models is likely to grow in the future. Such 
arrangements raise particular issues in terms of ensuring that messages are 
accurately conveyed and received along with needing to support effective 
student&ndash;supervisor relationships. Reliance on technology can generate 
technical issues and the absence of actual face-to-face contact alters the 
sense of presence between the parties. Supervisors should seek to avoid 
over-reliance on email and find other ways to engage with students.
</p>
<p>If supervision occurs at a distance, then it can be helpful to use some 
form of video-conferencing to foster the inter-personal dimensions of the 
relationship. Gibson provides useful guidance on how to structure video-
conferencing to make it an effective supervision tool. In essence, Gibson&rsquo;s

<p>message is to concentrate on being an effective listener. She suggests using a 
formal structure that sees each participant speaking without interruption, 
then listening without interrupting, with conscious turn-taking.85 It can 
also be helpful to prepare for supervision discussions by developing and 
sharing an agenda ahead of the meeting.
</p>
<p>Principles to inform law school structures 
in support of clinical supervision
The Australian Best Practices includes the following principles relating 
to&nbsp;clinical supervision:86
</p>
<p>The supervision needs of students vary according to: 
</p>
<p>1.1 the objectives of the clinic and clients&rsquo; needs; and
</p>
<p>1.2 the experience and level of training the students already possess.
</p>
<p>Supervision arrangements are designed to assist students to link theory 
and practice and work collaboratively with supervisors on addressing 
clients&rsquo; needs. The arrangements also enable students to encounter a range 
of work (both areas of law and legal tasks) during their clinic experience.
</p>
<p>Supervision is structured, with ground rules and clear learning objectives. 
As a system, it ensures students&rsquo; right to supervision and feedback, 
together with support and respect for both supervisees and supervisors.
</p>
<p>Supervisors meet with each student on a regular basis as well as having the 
capacity to respond to unpredictable events.
</p>
<p>Development of a strong supervision relationship relies on supervisors 
as&nbsp;role models.
</p>
<p>These student-focused principles are designed to provide a platform to 
assist law schools to appreciate the importance of effective supervision. 
They&nbsp; also emphasise the value of law schools engaging with both 
supervisors&nbsp; and students to make clinical experiences as constructive 
as&nbsp;possible.

<p>Guidance for supervisors
Supervisors face a challenging task in balancing the interests of their 
organisation and their duties to clients along with the interests of the 
students. The diversity of contexts in which student supervision takes 
place makes it difficult to develop universal best practices. This&nbsp;difficulty 
is reinforced by the limited time available to some supervisors to 
tailor their supervision to fit with program objectives and the needs 
of&nbsp;particular&nbsp;students. 
</p>
<p>The following guide provides a basic framework for use by supervisors, 
especially those who are new to working with students in a clinic context, 
whether in-house or as part of an external placement. It is designed both 
as a framework and a prompt for discussion as part of the training that 
should be a key part of preparing supervisors for their engagement with 
clinic students. 
</p>
<p>Understand the program
&bull; Use the program objectives to frame your approach (see Chapter 4).
&bull; Be clear about what the law school expects of you and each student 
</p>
<p>(the intended learning outcomes: see Chapter 4).
&bull; Appreciate the value of &lsquo;learning by doing and reflecting&rsquo; (see Chapter&nbsp;7).
</p>
<p>Communicate clearly
&bull; Listen carefully and encourage students to explain their views.
&bull; Specific feedback is a key to supervision.
&bull; Be candid and constructive.
&bull; Be sure that students understand each task they are to complete. 
</p>
<p>Be sensitive
&bull; Be sensitive to both clients and students. Most of us are more sensitive

&bull; Corroborate your views with your colleagues.
&bull; Keep a record of your key observations.
&bull; Encourage students to be accountable.
</p>
<p>Whenever possible, enjoy your involvement with students. 
</p>
<p>Preparing students to make the most 
of supervision
An aspect of supervision practice that warrants closer examination is how 
to best prepare students for their work with their clinic supervisor as 
constructively as possible. Law schools can assist their students to prepare 
for the learning and service opportunities they will encounter in the clinic. 
</p>
<p>Supervision issues that can usefully be addressed in preparing students for 
their relationship with their clinic supervisor include the following:
</p>
<p>Prepare in a professional manner. Students should expect to receive clear 
instructions on the task at hand rather than have their supervisor provide 
them with answers to research issues. Students should check their work </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>151
</p>
<p>6 . The imPoRTAnCe of effeCTive SUPeRviSion
</p>
<p>before consulting their supervisor and anticipate and address issues the 
supervisor may raise. This can be usefully summarised as &lsquo;make it easy for 
your supervisor to guide and support you&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Consider the relationship from the supervisor&rsquo;s perspective. Mutual respect is 
a key to any relationship. It is also helpful for students to appreciate that 
good supervision is time-consuming. 
</p>
<p>Receive feedback in a constructive manner. The United States Best Practices 
guide calls on students to &lsquo;listen to the critique with care and an 
open&nbsp;mind&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Be proactive. Taking a problem-solving approach is as important in the 
student&ndash;supervisor relationship as it is in the student&ndash;client relationship. 
</p>
<p>Take a reflective approach. Students should appraise their own performance 
and be honest about whether they have performed well. 
</p>
<p>Always remember the client. Students need to appreciate the central 
significance of their client in whatever work they do. Working with and 
on behalf of the client is central to professional work. 
</p>
<p>Ryan Cole and Wortham provide constructive advice to law students 
about how they can most productively approach the supervision process.87 
They emphasise the value of students being prepared, setting goals and 
clarifying each assignment. Clinical students should also make the most 
of the opportunity to learn from the experiences of their fellow students. 
Seminars, workshops and &lsquo;case rounds&rsquo;88 all provide valuable opportunities 
for students to learn from their peers as well as from their supervisors. 
This is particularly effective for external placement programs where the 
opportunities to learn from peers are reinforced by the diversity of the 
legal work done in a wide range of placement sites. 
</p>
<p>It is also important for students and academics to make the most of 
the learning opportunities provided by group discussions as part of the 
classroom component of placement programs. This is particularly valuable 
for externship programs. The diversity of legal workplaces generates 
significant scope for reciprocal learning with students sharing insights and 
learning from each other&rsquo;s experiences. The academic can usefully take

<p>Effective&nbsp;law&nbsp;student&nbsp;supervision&nbsp;project
A comprehensive set of resources to support the effective planning and 
conduct of law student supervision is available at the website for the 
Effective Law Student Supervision Project developed by Professor Jeff 
Giddings at Griffith Law School.89 The website contains materials for 
students, supervisors and those responsible for managing programs that 
involve students learning through supervision. 
</p>
<p>Conclusion
Effective supervision is fundamental across all models of clinical legal 
education. It safeguards the interests of clients and provides the structure 
that supports and constructively challenges students. Supervisors have 
always played a central role in helping students to make sense of the 
complex environment they encounter. As a clinical legal education 
community, we need to further develop our collective understanding of 
what makes for effective supervision. This is especially so in relation to 
externship arrangements, where supervisors face competing priorities and 
often receive limited law school support and have had little training for 
their role. 
</p>
<p>Improving the preparation and practices of supervisors requires careful 
planning by those responsible for clinical programs. Law schools will 
benefit from engaging with the legal profession to promote involvement 
in student placement programs. As more law schools and other legal 
education institutions seek out placement opportunities for their students, 
challenges are bound to arise in terms of promoting effective practices. 
Clinics need to plan for the prospect that they will face expectations to 
further contribute to preparing students for professional relationships 
beyond law school.

Reflective&nbsp;practice:&nbsp;The&nbsp;essence&nbsp;
</p>
<p>of clinical legal education
</p>
<p>Introduction
It is a longstanding assertion of clinical legal educators the world over 
that one of the most important elements of a good clinical program is 
reflection. Roy Stuckey, in his highly regarded and often-referred-to book, 
Best Practices for Legal Education,1 articulates it as &lsquo;helping students learn 
how to learn from experience&rsquo;, while Milstein puts it more formally with 
his suggestion that the ultimate aim of clinical teaching is to develop 
reflective practitioners and lifelong learners.2
</p>
<p>Our recent research on clinical legal education in Australia has confirmed 
the importance of reflection. Australian clinical legal educators from 
a&nbsp;broad range of programs consistently identified reflection as central to 
the clinical legal education process, many calling it a &lsquo;minimum standard&rsquo; 
for clinical legal education programs.3 This observation should hardly 
be a&nbsp; surprise, as clinical legal education is experiential learning and, as 
Stuckey has argued, optimal experiential learning involves a circular

<p>sequence of experience, reflection, theory and practice.4 This universal 
recognition within Australian clinics of the role of reflection led us to 
consider in more depth exactly what is meant by reflection and why it is 
so important to clinics.
</p>
<p>Our research shows that reflection and reflective practice are often used 
to assess students in clinical programs; this is evident from the repeated 
reference to reflection by those we surveyed when asked about how they 
assess students. Our research shows that reflective workshops, debriefs, 
blogs and journals are all used to assess such diverse aspects of the clinical 
process as client sensitivity and empathy, sociolegal awareness, and even 
intellectual grasp of substantive law.5 While the scope of our research 
was not designed to tease out the distinction between assessing reflective 
thought and using reflection to assess more substantive legal skills, this 
crossover raised some very interesting questions for us, such as what 
exactly is reflection within a clinical legal context? Should it be assessed 
and, if so, how? And finally, if reflection is relied on to measure the success 
of our students against a range of other criteria, is enough emphasis being 
placed on the process of reflection itself?
</p>
<p>These questions could not be answered without a clear understanding of 
what reflective practice is and why it is considered so crucial to clinical 
legal education. Once we delved into these questions it became clear that 
while almost all clinicians see reflection as vital, there are very different 
views on what it is, and many clinicians were in the dark as to how to 
most effectively foster reflective practice in our students. 
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will explore reflection in the clinical legal setting, 
drawing on the literature on reflection and our own research. We will 
&lsquo;think&nbsp; through&rsquo; what reflective practice actually means and why it 
should be part of clinical legal programs. We then turn our attention to 
how it might be taught and assessed. There has been much discussion, 
both within clinical legal programs and beyond, as to how we assess 
reflection (or even&nbsp;if we should) and we will explore this discussion in the 
Australian&nbsp;context.

<p>What our research discovered 
about&nbsp;reflection
Before we begin, a few words should be said about our research and what 
its findings suggest about reflection in clinical legal teaching. As canvassed 
in Chapter 1, the first stage of our research surveyed all the clinical legal 
education programs offered across the country. We did not ask direct 
questions about reflection and, in fact, reflection was not mentioned 
in&nbsp;our survey document. This was an unfortunate oversight, although it 
is of interest that reflection appeared repeatedly in the responses to our 
questions. For example, the first part of the survey asked for details of the 
program being surveyed, while the second part asked about what might 
make a &lsquo;good&rsquo; clinical program. In that second section, our open-ended 
question about whether there are any minimum standards that should 
be achieved in clinical programs elicited responses that almost always 
mentioned reflection.6 
</p>
<p>The next section of the survey was aimed at supervision and supervision 
standards, and again reflection and reflective practice featured large. 
For&nbsp; example, when asked about the appropriate length of a clinical 
program, a typical response was that it needed to be long enough to allow 
reflection and the development of reflective skills.7 However, the section 
in which the most references to reflection appeared dealt with questions 
about assessment. It is clear that almost all clinics use reflection, whether 
through discussions, presentations, journals or blogs, to help them assess 
their students. 
</p>
<p>The section of the survey headed &lsquo;Clinical Supervision Standards&rsquo; again 
showed us how important reflection is. Respondents were asked to 
comment on if and how they assess a variety of capacities, understandings 
and skills. These ranged from client sensitivity and ethical and sociolegal 
awareness to intellectual grasp of substantive law, drafting, negotiating 
and advocacy skills, self-organisation, and comprehension of the law 
reform process. Reflection and reflective practices, including reflective 
discussions, workshops, blogs or journals, were repeatedly cited as ways in 
which students were assessed against all these varied competencies.

</p>
<p>There is perhaps a lack of clarity in the way that clinicians communicate 
to their students the aim or role of the reflective exercises they ask of them. 
Because reflective exercises are often used to assess more than simply the 
students&rsquo; ability to reflect, we may be diluting the message that reflection 
in itself is important. It is possible that the readiness to use reflection as 
a form of assessment means that we are giving our students some mixed 
messages about what it means to reflect, and weakening understanding of 
the inherent value of reflection itself. Mary Ryan has commented: 
</p>
<p>Despite the common (and often undefined) use of the terms reflection 
or reflective in assessment tasks ... learners are not often taught how to 
reflect, which different types of reflection are possible, or how best to 
communicate their disciplinary knowledge through reflection.8
</p>
<p>It is clear across the responses to our survey that reflection is core to clinical 
legal education. But is this because clinicians rely on reflection to assess 
other capacities, or is it because reflection is valued as a fundamental skill 
and an inherent part of a good clinical legal program? There is no doubt 
that reflective exercises, whether oral or written, are a rare opportunity to 
understand better the thought processes, assumptions, values and beliefs 
held by our students. It can also be hard to resist opportunities to test how 
well we have taught other aspects of our courses. However, is this really 
the role of reflection? To answer this question we need to be clear on what 
reflection is.
</p>
<p>What&nbsp;is&nbsp;reflection?
&lsquo;[Reflection] is the magic ingredient which converts legal experience into 
education.&rsquo;9
</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of writing on reflection and the role it should 
play in the education or development of professionals. Teaching reflective 
practice has long been the norm in education, nursing and social work as 
well as in many other disciplines, and the literature from this wealth of 
experience has a lot to offer the discipline of law. Law, on the other hand,

<p>7 . RefLeCTive PRACTiCe
</p>
<p>has barely begun to explore reflection and the idea of teaching reflective 
practice. So what does reflection mean and what does it look like in the 
context of legal education? 
</p>
<p>Discussion of reflection, what it is and why it might be important to 
professional practice goes back many decades. In the early 1900s, Dewey 
looked closely at how we think and, in a book of that name, he analysed 
the different ways in which we think about a given issue or situation.10 
He identified several different ways of thinking, including stream of 
consciousness, belief, imagination or invention and, of course, reflection.
</p>
<p>Although Dewey did not necessarily articulate it in this way, clinical 
students often find it helpful to think about these different ways 
of&nbsp; thinking in a progressive way. That is, when faced with an issue or, 
for&nbsp; example, a client&rsquo;s problem, the most immediate response of the 
student/practitioner11 is a continuous stream of consciousness in their 
mind. This is a natural, common and, it could be argued, unavoidable 
response to a new experience. Dewey describes it as everything that 
&lsquo;goes through our minds&rsquo;.12 This stream of consciousness perhaps tries to 
capture as much of the information the student/practitioner is presented 
with as possible&mdash;but it is not yet ordered or structured. 
</p>
<p>From this stream of consciousness, the student/practitioner often 
then moves into another of Dewey&rsquo;s types of thinking: belief. Almost 
immediately, a student/practitioner will start to rely on belief&mdash;they may 
not even be able to articulate how, but the information from their stream 
of consciousness is triggering in them &lsquo;understandings&rsquo; or beliefs they 
already hold. So, for example, the student/practitioner may assume that a 
client who presents with a legal issue about divorce is in conflict with the 
other party, even if that has not been said. Belief is not based on evidence, 
it is not proven and it is not necessarily true (although it may be), yet it is 
held by the student/practitioner to be true.
</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, the student/practitioner will also start to engage 
in invention or imagination. This form of thinking involves starting to 
extrapolate solutions or possible options out of the information they 
</p>
<p>10  John Dewey, How We Think (1910) DC Heath.
11  We use this term in this chapter to highlight that it is the student acting as practitioner whom 
we are describing: not yet practitioner and still subject to supervision, but trying to put themselves 
in&nbsp;the position of practitioner.
12  John Dewey, cited at footnote 10, 2.</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>158
</p>
<p>already have. In our example, the student/practitioner may start to think 
&lsquo;perhaps if this client tells their spouse that they don&rsquo;t want child support, 
then they will be able to negotiate arrangements for the children&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>Reflection draws on all of these types of thinking but goes further: &lsquo;it is the 
&hellip; active, persistent, and careful consideration of any belief or supposed 
form of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it and the 
further conclusion to which it leads&rsquo;.13
</p>
<p>Reflection is grounded in experience, as it is experience that allows the 
testing of the other types of knowledge. In our example, the student/
practitioner can reflect and draw together the other ways of thinking, 
but can also test them. They might hypothesise that the client may have 
some residue ill feeling towards their spouse, and then they might inquire 
further about the client&rsquo;s feelings and how they influence what the client 
wants. For Dewey, reflection was not possible without experience, but 
experience was meaningless without reflection. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, Sch&ouml;n, writing in the 1980s, accentuated experience or action 
as a fundamental prerequisite to reflection, particularly in the education 
of professionals. Sch&ouml;n explained:
</p>
<p>in the midst of their education for practice there was a profound sense of 
mystery. This feeling resulted from the fact that the students literally did 
not know what they were doing, and their teachers could not tell them &ndash; 
because what the teachers knew how to say the students could not at that 
point in their experience understand. 
</p>
<p>The students had to have the experience of trying to do the thing before 
they would be ready to understand the kind of explanations that the 
teachers could give them about what they were doing.14
</p>
<p>Kolb, writing at much the same time, focused very specifically on 
the learning process, conceptualising a cycle that involved concrete 
experience, active experimentation, abstract conceptualisation and 
reflective observation. We return to this below, but Kolb&rsquo;s point was 
that effective learning involves all four elements of the cycle in a kind of 
constant rotation.15 While the learner could enter the cycle at any point,

</p>
<p>Kolb clearly linked the cycle to concrete experience, and reflection flows 
from that. Gibbs, in his book Learning by Doing,16 also conceptualised 
the process in a circular way through his reflective cycle. The reflective 
cycle includes description, feelings, evaluation, analysis, conclusion and 
action plan. Description requires a simple retelling of what happened, and 
the reflective thinker then expresses the feelings these events produced in 
them. They then move to assessing the good and the bad in the situation 
before engaging in a deeper analysis in order to find meaning. From 
there they consider what they could have done differently in order to get 
a&nbsp;different (improved) outcome; and finally they consider an action plan 
of what they would do if the situation arose again.
</p>
<p>More recently, Bain and others suggest a &lsquo;five Rs&rsquo; framework of reporting, 
responding, relating, reasoning and reconstructing,17 which Ryan18 
reduces to four through the merging of reporting and responding. This 
framework also begins with a concrete experience, which then becomes 
the subject of each action described in the four Rs. Bain&rsquo;s framework is 
very helpful in the context of clinical legal education, and is discussed in 
more detail in a report commissioned by the then Australian Learning 
and&nbsp;Teaching Council.19
</p>
<p>For Sch&ouml;n, true reflective practice comes not only from action or 
experience&nbsp; but more specifically from the uncertainty, uniqueness and 
conflict of that experience. Sch&ouml;n believed that this uncertainty goes to 
the heart of professional work in that professionals do something more 
than simply apply the technical rationality of their discipline; they use 
judgment, experience, intuition and reflection-in-action to solve problems. 
It is this idea&mdash;that reflection generates uncertainty and conflict&mdash;
that is most interesting for clinicians&rsquo; purposes. It describes the ability 
of reflection to question assumptions, and acknowledges that this can 
be&nbsp;a&nbsp;very unsettling experience. In some cases the assumptions may even 
be unconscious, but they nevertheless form and influence our perspective.

</p>
<p>The process of reflection, therefore, not only suggests a&nbsp; questioning of 
these assumptions, but leads to inquiry and discovery and, commonly, 
culminates in perspective transformation. 
</p>
<p>Why&nbsp;do&nbsp;we&nbsp;want&nbsp;to&nbsp;teach&nbsp;reflective&nbsp;practice?
Now that we know a little more about what reflective practice looks like, 
and perhaps what it aims to achieve, why do we want to teach it as part 
of clinical legal education? Expressed slightly differently, the question 
might actually be: why is clinical legal education so well placed to teach 
reflection? Stuckey asserts that helping students learn how to learn from 
experience &lsquo;may be the most important goal of legal education&rsquo;.20 
</p>
<p>Four main reasons to teach reflection emerged from our research: 
</p>
<p>&bull; Clinical legal education has a unique ability to provide rich and 
unpredictable experience that so lends itself to deep reflection. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Reflection can offer a perspective on (and perhaps respite from) the 
dominance of positivist black letter law within legal education. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Teaching reflection can develop our students&rsquo; resilience in a profession 
that has some of the highest incidences of mental stress. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Reflection assists students to understand and critique the law in 
context, which is particularly important because of the unique position 
that lawyers hold within the community. 
</p>
<p>We deal with each of these in turn.
</p>
<p>Reflection&nbsp;aids&nbsp;the&nbsp;educative&nbsp;process,&nbsp;
while&nbsp;experience&nbsp;aids&nbsp;reflection
Clinical legal education has a unique ability to expose students to new, 
strange and previously unimaginable experiences. This is particularly 
because it involves working with live clients; that is, when students are 
asked to participate in a real legal practice with clients and their actual 
legal cases. Unlike a case study, or even a simulation, which is selected or 
written by the educator, a real client enters the students&rsquo; experience as a 
bundle of unpredictable, often contradictory, facts, feeling and impulses. 
</p>
<p>20  Roy Stuckey and others, cited at footnote 1. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>161
</p>
<p>7 . RefLeCTive PRACTiCe
</p>
<p>Students must respond to all of these. Of course they need to develop the 
skills that will enable them to identify the relevant legal facts, just as they 
would in a class exercise, but they cannot do it in the kind of isolation that 
non-clinical methods allow. 
</p>
<p>Almost any client seeking legal advice will have a problem that 
encompasses&nbsp; different areas of law, and the facts are never presented 
neatly. This means that students dealing with such situations cannot 
simply fall back on conventional classroom teaching. They need to 
develop new strategies and approaches to problem-solving, through the 
process of&nbsp;reflection.21
</p>
<p>If new strategies are required, then the best way for the student to 
learn the reflective lesson is to be exposed to these experiences over and 
over. We&nbsp;should successively ask them to respond, to think about their 
response, and then to alter their response the next time as a result of 
their thinking. The multiple layers of the clinical method allow and then 
stimulate a&nbsp;deep,&nbsp;rich reflection in this way.
</p>
<p>Students often feel the weight of responsibility of working with real clients. 
That sense of responsibility can inspire them to put aside their focus on 
their own performance for assessment purposes and immerse themselves 
in their client&rsquo;s case. They become part of the experience because they 
are in the role of the practitioner, with a responsibility to do the best for 
their client; not simply a spectator with an opinion on how to proceed. 
Teaching students to reflect in this context has two interrelated benefits. 
First, it gives them a framework as they grapple with how they process this 
new and daunting experience and how they make sense of it. Secondly, 
it improves their ability to actually use the knowledge they have; to see 
their client&rsquo;s issues in the broader context and then use this knowledge to 
build a solution.
</p>
<p>Reflection can be applied to a range of areas of clinical legal education. 
In&nbsp; the area of skills acquisition, reflection may be used to develop a 
student&rsquo;s client skills, such as accurate fact-gathering. Take, for example, 
the student who assumes a client who cannot recall detail must be lying; 
if&nbsp; the student has the opportunity to consider the experience of their 
client, including the client&rsquo;s personal history and circumstances, then the 
student may start to question this assumption. The student may discover

<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>162
</p>
<p>that their client is receiving counselling for post-traumatic stress, or 
that the client suffered a brain injury that interferes with memory or, 
simply, that the client fears losing their children into state care due to the 
circumstances they are being asked to describe. The student might acquire 
these extra facts as part of the process of taking instructions, but if the 
student can go beyond simply noting them and think about how these 
facts might influence or affect their client, then they have begun to reflect. 
</p>
<p>Without reflection, clinical legal education becomes simply skills 
acquisition or, at best, work-integrated learning (WIL).22 WIL is 
undoubtedly an important part of education, and the exposure to 
workplace experience is an important step for students to begin to apply 
the knowledge they have obtained in the classroom. WIL placements 
may well encourage reflection; however, it is the intense and deliberate 
nature of the supervised clinical experience, the close relationship between 
the supervisor and their student and the recognition of immediate 
responsibility within the practice environment that particularly stimulate 
deeper learning through reflection.
</p>
<p>Reflection&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;antidote&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;technical/positivist&nbsp;
nature of legal education
One of Sch&ouml;n&rsquo;s major criticisms of the professions, including law, is their 
overemphasis on technical rationality. Technical rationality is Sch&ouml;n&rsquo;s 
term for the substantive knowledge of a profession. In the case of the 
legal profession, technical rationality refers to the legislation, secondary 
rules and case law. Sch&ouml;n argues that the legal academy has privileged 
the knowledge of these sources over the application of that knowledge, 
and therefore requires a distinction between thinking and doing.23 In this 
model, professional educators first teach their students the basic relevant 
science, then teach them the applied relevant science and then give them 
a practicum in which to work on applying that science to the everyday 
problem of practice.24
</p>
<p>This process does not sound foreign to anyone engaged in the teaching 
of law in the last few decades. However, the ongoing difficulty in the 
eyes of Sch&ouml;n is that it privileges basic knowledge over practice and

</p>
<p>narrowly defines what practice is. In this process, the basic knowledge is 
pre-eminent and alone gives legitimacy to the applied knowledge, which 
in turn legitimises the practice. But, in Sch&ouml;n&rsquo;s view, the practice is far 
broader than anything the basic knowledge can clearly support. He points 
to the reality faced by those who practise and try to teach practice: that the 
knowledge that seems relevant to the problems they address is often not 
the knowledge that is taught in the classroom.25 It is the assumption that 
professional practice is merely the application of a body of knowledge to 
a practical situation, which is so unhelpful and inadequate yet dominant 
within legal education.
</p>
<p>One possible side effect of this privileging of source knowledge over 
practice is the tendency of the legal academy to hold on to positivist 
approaches to the law. Positivists argue that the value and therefore validity 
of a law comes from its source&mdash;not its merit.26 It is not difficult to see 
how such a doctrine could develop within an academy that is divorced 
from practice and therefore divorced from the people affected by the 
operation of the law. For Sch&ouml;n, this privileging of the knowledge over 
its application in practice was an inversion of the natural order of things 
because the delivery of high-quality work for the client is the reason why 
we have professions in the first place.27 A shift to focus on the problem-
solving that takes place in practice would allow a reconsideration of the 
needs of the very people that the law is supposed to serve. 
</p>
<p>A review of Australian law schools undertaken by the Pearce Committee in 
1987 led to recommendations that teaching be integrated with intellectual 
skills,28 while the Carnegie Report in the United States called for an 
&lsquo;integration of realistic and real-life lawyering experiences throughout the 
curriculum, and challenges [to] American law schools to produce lawyers 
who are not only smart problem-solvers but also responsible professionals 
committed to service of both clients and the larger society&rsquo;.29

</p>
<p>In response to the Carnegie Report, one Australian professor observed: 
&lsquo;If&nbsp; students receive the message that intellectual capacities are prized 
beyond all else, then they will rely upon that in their future behaviour 
as legal practitioners. They will tend to be unconcerned with the impact 
their behaviour has on others.&rsquo;30
</p>
<p>The other major consequence of this approach is that it can set students 
up for failure. In fact, nothing they have been taught in law school, no 
matter how hard they have studied, can fully prepare them for practice. 
This is because legal practice is not just about substantive legal knowledge, 
it is also about processes: the process of building rapport with a client so 
that they can get the full picture; the process of applying the different silos 
of legal knowledge taught in law school to think about a holistic solution 
to the client&rsquo;s issue; the process of applying legal knowledge and thinking 
through the effect on the client and their situation while discussing this 
with the client to ensure they are acting on instructions. These are but a 
few of the complex processes that are part of practice, and they all rely on 
reflection. It is the practitioner&rsquo;s ability to reflect, and then to alter their 
part in the process to produce a better outcome, which develops them 
as&nbsp;a&nbsp;practitioner.
</p>
<p>This practice-based approach to legal education sees students as active 
participants in their own learning. It has many benefits that respond 
to deficiencies in the way in which law is traditionally taught. Law is 
usually taught as if there is one right (correct and ethically compliant) 
answer to every legal problem and as if the practice of law does not need 
to engage in any way the practitioner&rsquo;s own judgment, values or ethics. 
This leads students to see ethical practice as something that is solely a 
matter of source knowledge, such as ethical rules, rather than the result 
of well-developed professional judgment. By ignoring the personal aspect 
of ethical practice, that part that relies on the practitioner&rsquo;s own skills 
and judgment, legal education leaves students ill prepared for ethical, 
sustainable legal practice.

</p>
<p>Reflection&nbsp;to&nbsp;educate&nbsp;for&nbsp;lifelong&nbsp;learners&nbsp;
and resilient practitioners
Reflection can serve as a useful link between study and practice. Students 
who are taught how to reflect, and who are exposed to the benefits arising 
from reflection, are unlikely to stop reflecting once they have handed in 
their last journal entry for their clinical course or graduated from law 
school. Properly developed, genuine reflective skills become a practice, a 
habit that leads the practitioner to greater understanding of themselves 
and their practice: 
</p>
<p>What [an individual] has learned in the way of knowledge and skill in one 
situation becomes an instrument of understanding and dealing effectively 
with the situations which follow. The process goes on as long as life and 
learning continue.31
</p>
<p>It is this incremental type of reflection that develops and supports 
lifelong learners, as it allows an understanding of how thinking and doing 
interact. Understanding this link then allows development that draws on 
both. Theorists have articulated the link between experience, reflection 
and learning,32 one describing reflection as &lsquo;the bridge of meaning that 
connects one experience to the next that gives direction and impetus to 
growth&rsquo;.33
</p>
<p>Some studies have pointed to the fact that students feel a sense of loss 
because their commitment to social justice principles and public interest 
practice diminishes over the course of their studies.34 The reflective 
dimension of clinical legal education can address this problem by 
inculcating a sense of belonging through involvement, engagement and 
connectedness with their degree, educators and fellow students.35 During 
our research, we heard many anecdotal accounts of students&rsquo; gratitude for 
feeling connected with fellow students in clinical legal settings, something 
many of them had not experienced in the broader law school environment.

<p>In addition to fostering growth, reflection can also promote resilience, 
which has become more important in light of recent research pointing to 
the particular difficulties the legal profession has with mental stress and 
depression. As we discussed more fully in Chapter 2, law students are 
susceptible to mental stress and face real challenges to their wellbeing.36 
Reflection gives students a structure and a process that can be applied not 
only to their legal practice but also to themselves and their experiences. 
For example, reflection allows a practitioner to explore their views on the 
legal system, or on the hierarchal structure of the firm or organisation 
in which they are working. They are able to step back and critique the 
structures in which they find themselves operating, rather than feel 
powerless and be swept along by them. As Kegan explains, being able 
to reflect &lsquo;is an active demonstration of a mind that can stand enough 
apart from its own opinions, values, rules, and definitions to avoid being 
completely identified with them. It is able to keep from feeling that the 
whole self has been violated when its opinions, values, rules, or definitions 
are challenged&rsquo;.37
</p>
<p>In this way, the ability to reflect and to develop from that reflection offers 
a lifeline for practitioners, and fosters resilience in the face of a stressful 
profession.
</p>
<p>Reflection&nbsp;to&nbsp;expose&nbsp;students&nbsp;to&nbsp;law&nbsp;in&nbsp;context
Reflection can be a mechanism that raises the student&rsquo;s awareness of law 
in context. The phrase &lsquo;law in context&rsquo; sums up the desirability of teaching 
law students to think critically about the law, rules and practices from 
a&nbsp;range of perspectives.38 Teaching students this kind of critical reflection 
was consistently recognised throughout our research as an important role 
of clinical legal education. This was reflected not only in the initial process,

<p>which recorded the views of those actively engaged in delivering clinical 
legal programs, but also in the focus groups and our further development 
of Best Practices. 
</p>
<p>Reflection is an important part of this kind of learning; when students 
are provided with opportunities to examine and reflect on their beliefs, 
philosophies and practices, they are more likely to see themselves as active 
change agents and lifelong learners within their professions.39 This is a 
powerful educative tool, particularly in light of Dewey&rsquo;s assertion that it is 
the aim of progressive education &lsquo;to take part in correcting unfair privilege 
and unfair deprivation, not to perpetuate them&rsquo;.40
</p>
<p>Many students make far-reaching assumptions about the ways the law 
operates. For example, a student may start with a fundamental belief 
that the operation of the law is fair and equitable. If they accept that 
sometimes the outcome of legal proceedings might not be just, then 
they may attribute it to the poor performance of one of the lawyers, or 
to the absence of crucial information before the decision-maker, or to 
some procedural mishap that was not the intention of the law. However, 
reflecting on the actual experience can show that this is not necessarily 
the case; legal proceedings may result in an overtly or apparently unfair 
result exactly because of the intended operation of the law. For example, 
property laws are often designed to protect the rights of owners, which 
can lead to tenants being evicted without consideration of their housing 
rights or personal circumstances.
</p>
<p>Clinical programs can expose students to what actually happens in the 
practice of law when they reflect on these realities. Often it is the first 
time that a student can see the impact of a client&rsquo;s circumstances, such as 
a lack of financial resources, a lack of cultural and linguistic knowledge, 
or simply a lack of knowledge of the law and how it operates. Clinics can 
shift the focus from the law and the legal system, which students examine 
in law school, to its effect on the client. The client and their experience 
become the central concern and, from this new position external to the 
legal system, students are better able to critique the legal system. It is 
reflection that both enhances and supports this process. This&nbsp; different

</p>
<p>understanding of law and the legal system can be uncomfortable for 
students, but a student who can reflect is better placed to deal with these 
new insights than one who is never taught the reflective method we 
describe below.
</p>
<p>How&nbsp;should&nbsp;we&nbsp;teach&nbsp;reflective&nbsp;practice?
We now have a clearer vision of what reflective practice might look 
like and why we want to develop it in our students. The next issue is, 
how do we do so? There has been some criticism of Sch&ouml;n for failing 
to satisfactorily explain exactly how the coaching for reflective practice 
might be conducted.41
</p>
<p>This leads to one of the very common frustrations of students who are 
trying to become professionals, what Sch&ouml;n calls the &lsquo;paradox of &hellip; 
having to plunge into doing &ndash; without knowing, in essential ways, what 
one needs to learn&rsquo;, in order to learn by doing.42 In encapsulating the 
essence of the clinical method, Sch&ouml;n is also referring to the practice of 
reflection&mdash;it is necessary to ask students to reflect from a very early stage 
in their clinical experience, and possibly even before they have a full grasp 
of what reflection is. This process is, of course, best supported by good 
supervision, which we discussed in Chapter 6.
</p>
<p>We propose three crucial aspects to teaching reflection, summarised as: 
value it, explain it and support it.
</p>
<p>Value it
Reflective thinking and practice must be valued, and be seen to be valued, 
by practitioners and supervisors within the clinic. For some clinical 
teachers, who may have come from high-turnover, high-pressure practices 
such as legal aid or community law, reflection can be seen as a more 
academic pursuit and not central to the legal work. If this message is given 
to students, then they are more likely to consider reflection as an irritation

</p>
<p>that takes their time and attention away from the &lsquo;real&rsquo; legal work, and 
are more likely to turn in reflective pieces that attempt to &lsquo;give the marker 
what they want&rsquo;, rather than engage in real reflection.
</p>
<p>One crucial way that clinicians can demonstrate the importance of 
reflection to their students is to model it in their own practice. Clinical 
supervisors who are unwilling to reflect on their practice by, for example, 
admitting difficulties or mistakes and verbalising how it could have been 
done better are ill placed to extol the virtues of reflection. Reflection 
has to be integrated into the clinical course; it should be the work of all 
supervisors, and not just fall to those most interested in that &lsquo;touchy feely&rsquo; 
stuff. It may be that for students to value reflection it must also be assessed 
in some way, an issue we explore below.
</p>
<p>Reflective discussion can be a useful tool to stimulate and deepen 
reflection, but clinicians need to ensure that they move away from 
placing the teacher in the only &lsquo;power&rsquo; role at the front of the class.43 
Clinicians should resist the practice of commenting authoritatively on all 
contributions by students and, rather, try to facilitate discussion within 
the group. This approach can be difficult within the traditional pedagogy 
of a law school. Even clinicians find it hard to break the habit of allowing 
their students to look to the teacher and the teacher alone for validation 
of students&rsquo; contributions.
</p>
<p>Explain it
To foster reflection, both supervisors and students must understand 
what it is, in both a theoretical and practical sense. This starts with an 
appreciation of the role of the clinical supervisor as facilitator.
</p>
<p>The role adopted by the clinical teacher should be that of facilitator, rather 
than that of the master who can give the answers on every issue&mdash;&lsquo;indeed 
to be an effective facilitator the teacher should resist the temptation to 
give answers, and try to guide the student towards finding them for 
themselves&rsquo;.44

</p>
<p>170
</p>
<p>The foundation for understanding this facilitative role is transparent 
discussion underpinned by a theoretical framework&mdash;both the supervisors 
and the students need a theoretical grounding and a commitment to open 
and transparent exchange. Many writers have pointed out the benefits 
of teaching theory in an integrated way,45 arguing that a theoretical 
background enables students to better understand reflection and why it 
is part of their course. The Kolb cycle of learning is commonly used to 
illustrate the differences between concrete experience (doing), reflective 
observation (thinking), abstract conceptualisation (extrapolating) and 
active experimentation (testing).

</p>
<p>This visual representation of a cycle, through which students might pass 
numerous times within one interaction, can be very helpful to them 
while grappling with the theory of reflection. Answering criticism that 
this cycle oversimplified learning by reducing it to a mechanical step-by-
step process, Kolb has further identified &lsquo;[t]he two dialectically related

</p>
<p>Other students may prefer Gibbs&rsquo; approach, which, with its grounding 
in common language and experience, is perhaps of more use to students 
trying to relate the concept of reflection to their own developing practice 
as lawyers. Gibbs also describes reflection through a cycle, but includes 
description, feelings, evaluation, analysis, alternative approaches and 
action plan.

</p>
<p>Whichever framework is chosen, there is great value in exposing students 
to the academic work that has been done on reflection. The exploration of 
the theoretical basis of reflection might serve as a starting point. However, 
the practical manifestations of reflection beyond the theory must also 
be explained to answer this ever-present question for a clinical teacher: 
what, exactly, are we looking for as evidence of students&rsquo; reflection? 
Are&nbsp;personal ruminations enough, or are there specific criteria that can 
guide assessment? To answer these questions, clinicians need to clearly

</p>
<p>explain to their students why they want them to reflect, what they mean 
by reflection and, finally, how their reflection is being assessed (if indeed 
it is being assessed).
</p>
<p>Actual demonstrations to students of reflective practice are vital. This 
demonstration starts with supervisors modelling good reflection in their 
discussion of their own practice. It should also involve tangible examples: 
if students are being asked to keep a reflective journal then they need to 
see and discuss some examples of good reflective journal writing. Such 
examples might come from past students, with due recognition of privacy 
issues, or may draw on material that, while not written for that purpose, 
may nevertheless provide an opportunity for analysis and critique. 
Looking at a literary work unrelated to law but familiar to the students, 
with the question &lsquo;is this piece reflective?&rsquo;, can also be useful. 
</p>
<p>At its essence, reflection is relatively simple: &lsquo;Reflection is a basic mental 
process with either a purpose, an outcome, or both, applied in situations 
in which material is unstructured or uncertain and where there is no 
obvious solution.&rsquo;49
</p>
<p>Dewey helps us to understand how we think, and subsequent theorists 
such as Sch&ouml;n and Kolb suggest the processes by which those ways of 
thinking might work together to produce new insights and action. 
A clinical teacher must build on this to explain to their students how 
such processes can support and develop their professional judgment and 
therefore their practice. Jennifer Moon has asserted that &lsquo;there is no point 
in defining reflection in a manner that does not relate to the everyday use 
of the word&rsquo;.50 She then observes that reflection is a means of working on 
what we already know. 
</p>
<p>This is a very good starting point for the use of reflection within clinical 
teaching. What the student knows prior to meeting with a client might 
be a collection of assumptions arising from the circumstances the client 
is in (that is, what legal issue they may have) and the &lsquo;truths&rsquo; that student 
might hold about those circumstances. For example, a client seeking 
advice about a looming eviction from public housing may trigger in the

</p>
<p>student a range of assumptions and conclusions based on their view of 
public housing. Depending on their own background and experience, 
these assumptions may be either negative or positive. 
</p>
<p>Then the student meets the client; now they have a lot of new information. 
What they know has suddenly doubled and much of the new information 
may challenge what they thought they knew prior to meeting the client. 
Reflection is the process by which the student can make sense of this&mdash;
through reflection they can identify the assumptions they held prior to 
meeting the client, and think through how those assumptions affected 
their approach. This can raise new questions, which will spark another 
round of fact-gathering through research or further discussion with 
the client. This is reflective and it can assist the student to arrive at a 
more nuanced and detailed understanding of their client and their legal 
issue. But it does not end there. Reflection can also assist the student to 
think about their own approach. They may ask: &lsquo;Why did I have those 
assumptions prior to meeting the client? What were they based on and do 
I see it differently now?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Support it
The way clinicians support reflection is to allow space for it within the 
course they teach. Clinical programs in Australia are often highly frenetic 
environments. There are often too many clients to see and many complex 
issues to deal with. In addition, there can be a tension between addressing 
the educational development and skills acquisition of the student while 
also trying to encourage engagement with the broader social issues. 
In&nbsp;the midst of all this it is easy to overlook the structural and practical 
requirements to support good reflective practice. The major requirement 
is time; that is, ensuring there is time to properly reflect on the work 
being done, the observations of the students, and the assumptions and 
challenges that come with them.
</p>
<p>Taking enough time may mean ensuring that time is made available for 
group debriefing around case issues or client work, for scheduled meetings 
between student and supervisor in which deeper discussion of the day&rsquo;s 
practice is encouraged, or for regular meetings where reflections are shared 
with peers and discussion of both the work and the students&rsquo; experience 
of the work is encouraged. It could mean allowing time at the end of 
the day for students to write in their journals. It might also require each 
student to produce a piece of reflective writing about their experiences </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>174
</p>
<p>and then share these within the class. Whatever form it takes, taking time 
for reflection has to be a central part of the structure of the course, and 
it has to be designed so that sufficient energy can be directed towards it.
</p>
<p>Spencer explains that paramount to teaching reflection is the establishment 
of an appropriate environment.51 She suggests a set of exercises that starts 
with private reflection, moves on to reflection in pairs on set topics, and 
finally moves into encouraging the students to share their reflections with 
the class. Stuckey advocates a similar creation of structures and protocols 
in order to assist students&rsquo; self-learning.52 Spencer observes that, in her 
experience, &lsquo;[s]tudents are prepared to take that risk if they feel supported 
and know that the risk will produce a positive result in the form of 
a&nbsp;validation of their feelings and encouragement for the future&rsquo;.53
</p>
<p>Should&nbsp;we&nbsp;assess&nbsp;reflective&nbsp;practice?
Some argue that an important way to value reflection is to ensure that 
it&nbsp;is&nbsp;assessed.
</p>
<p>Regrettably, for many students learning is driven largely by assessment. 
If reflection is not to be assessed then there must be a risk that some 
students will view it as less important than assessable work, and therefore 
potentially expendable.54
</p>
<p>While this may be true, there are two major concerns that arise from 
the assumption that reflection should always be assessed. The first is that 
any assessment risks driving students to simply express what they think 
those assessing them want to hear. The second is that assessing reflection 
becomes a kind of Trojan horse designed to &lsquo;get into our students&rsquo; heads&rsquo; 
so we can determine whether they have achieved other learning outcomes.
</p>
<p>The first concern was well expressed by Boud in a seminar given at 
Sheffield University in 2001 and cited by Ledvinka in 2006: &lsquo;assessment 
is inappropriate because it will stultify or even destroy &ldquo;raw reflection&rdquo;,

<p>7 . RefLeCTive PRACTiCe
</p>
<p>including students&rsquo; confidence in expressing themselves freely and 
exploratively, and that it may lead to unethical levels of disclosure and 
confession&rsquo;.55
</p>
<p>In addition to this anxiety there is some concern that, if assessed, students 
will be searching for the &lsquo;right&rsquo; thing to say or write, rather than really 
engaging in reflection of their experiences, thought and actions. This 
reservation of course leads to another question: is it appropriate to assess 
the content of the reflection, or simply the process of reflection? If the 
process is done well, then the resulting content may well reveal the core 
values or beliefs of a student. But is it ever appropriate for clinicians to 
&lsquo;assess&rsquo; such material?
</p>
<p>This dilemma leads us back to the issue raised at the beginning of this 
chapter: that our research revealed that reflection and reflective writings 
such as journal entries and blogs are often used to assess other aspects of 
what clinicians are trying to teach students. This purpose is inappropriate. 
As we repeat in Chapter 8, assessment of reflection is legitimate only to 
gauge whether a student understands the purpose of reflection in their 
learning. In other words, it is the process of reflection&mdash;as an aide to their 
learning&mdash;that we need students to comprehend and which it is legitimate 
to assess. If clinicians are going to use reflection to assess course content, 
then they are looking for the &lsquo;right answer&rsquo; rather than whether the 
student can engage in the process. Some might argue that if the student 
doesn&rsquo;t know their supervisor is using the reflective piece in this way then 
they will not necessarily try to provide the &lsquo;right answer&rsquo; or the content 
that is being sought. However, the fact that this is perhaps &lsquo;kept&rsquo; from 
the student does not improve the situation, because it is a fundamentally 
dishonest use of the reflective process. Accordingly, if&nbsp; clinicians are 
seeking to identify whether students understand the content of the course 
or the law involved, then they need to be clear about the assessment 
criteria of the task and at that point it is no longer purely an exercise in 
reflective&nbsp;practice. 
</p>
<p>Our research led us to suggest some best practices: for example, that 
reflective practice must be informed by relevant literature and incorporated 
into every clinical course in a structured, planned and thoughtful 
way.56 This,&nbsp; we suggest, includes providing students with a&nbsp; theoretical 
</p>

</p>
<p>176
</p>
<p>underpinning and a set of relevant resources/readings. We also suggest 
that prompt feedback be given on the reflective practice. Included in 
the best practices is a suggestion that any reflective practice builds on 
reflection in which students have already been engaged. However, this 
goal is aspirational as almost no clinical programs surveyed in our research 
clearly articulated this practice. Finally, we also suggest that reflective 
practice should be assessed and that assessment be criteria-based, with 
criteria that focus on the process rather than the content and that are 
always clearly linked to the learning outcomes of the particular course 
or&nbsp;unit.57
</p>
<p>How&nbsp;do&nbsp;we&nbsp;assess&nbsp;reflective&nbsp;practice?
There are many different ways in which reflective practice is assessed. In&nbsp;our 
research, clinicians described journals and blogs, class discussions and 
supervisor/student meetings among other methods. There is undoubtedly 
a correlation between the use of reflective practice to assess other aspects of 
clinical teaching and the more formal methods of reflection. For example, 
reflective journals were often cited as tools of assessment for a wide range 
of other skills and knowledge. At the same time, supervisor/student 
discussions were hardly ever cited as assessment tools. Although it can 
be argued that the role of such discussion in a supervisor&rsquo;s assessment of 
student performance is implicit, there is no doubt such discussion is a less 
formal and more flexible opportunity for exchange. We suggest that for 
this reason there may be value in keeping some space for reflection that is 
as informal as possible, perhaps in the form of impromptu discussions or 
debriefing sessions. It may further suggest the need for particular attention 
to be paid to the use of journals and blogs to ensure they remain truly 
reflective practice exercises and not just alternative forms of assessment. 
</p>
<p>Sch&ouml;n was very clear that eliciting and developing good reflective practice 
is a coaching, not a teaching, role. This idea was also articulated by 
Mezirow, who said that the ideal learning conditions for reflection are 
facilitative, with value conflict being handled effectively and underpinned

<p>by the principles of andragogy.58 Dewey saw community as important 
to reflection, a point picked up on by Rodgers59 when she identifies the 
following factors that highlight the benefits of collaborative reflection: 
</p>
<p>1. affirmation of the value of one&rsquo;s experience: in isolation what matters 
can be too easily dismissed as unimportant; 
</p>
<p>2. seeing things &lsquo;newly&rsquo;: others offer alternative meanings, broadening 
the field of understanding; 
</p>
<p>3. support to engage in the process of inquiry. 
</p>
<p>In relation to this last point, Rodgers observes that &lsquo;when one is 
accountable&nbsp; to a group, one feels a responsibility toward others that 
is&nbsp; more compelling than the responsibility we feel to only ourselves&rsquo;.60 
We&nbsp; suggest, in addition, that this collaborative aspect may also play 
a&nbsp;role in deconstructing the highly competitive individualisation of legal 
education and this may, in turn, have a positive effect on the mental 
health of our graduates.
</p>
<p>Conclusion
In this chapter, we have examined the role of reflection within clinical legal 
education, a role that goes beyond a simple endorsement of the importance 
of teaching reflective practice. Most clinicians agree that reflection should 
be a fundamental part of legal education, and that the clinical method 
offers unparalleled opportunities to develop reflective practice in our law 
students. Reflection is more than asking students to write down their 
thoughts as a way of making what they have actually learnt more visible. 
More importantly, it is a way in which clinicians can develop resilience 
in students by offering a powerful framework and process by which they 
can examine themselves, their role, and the system in which they are 
being asked to operate. In doing so, clinical legal education can produce 
practitioners with good ethical judgment, clear understanding of the law 
and a commitment to how it can benefit the broader community.

Clinical assessment 
</p>
<p>of students&rsquo; work
</p>
<p>Introduction
Australian clinics only occasionally spend time discussing the issue of 
student assessment. Clinical program leaders appear too often to face 
other more pressing challenges: finding suitable clinicians, dealing 
with academic colleagues&rsquo; misgivings about the cost of clinics or their 
pedagogical legitimacy and, especially, just finding the time to look 
outside their own law school and reflect on &lsquo;what could be&rsquo;, as opposed 
to &lsquo;what is&rsquo;. But when student assessment comes up in conversation or 
at conferences, the issues are seen to be significant and always in need 
of&nbsp;further thought. 
</p>
<p>Clinical assessment takes place against the background of general student 
assessment of law courses and, in this larger agenda, there is an unfortunate 
focus on competition as opposed to collaboration. That focus drives other 
debates, such as whether to grade students&rsquo; performance in some law 
schools, episodic law school pressure to apply moderating algorithms to 
clinical results, and the quest for ever more precise descriptors of varying 
clinical performance levels. Although not all law schools are determined 
to apply a &lsquo;grading curve&rsquo;&mdash;which operates to smooth out students&rsquo; results 
to fit a predetermined expectation of high, medium and poor academic 
performance&mdash;clinicians are predictably resistant to that concept when 
it rears its head. On the other hand, pressure for better grade definition 
and better methods of self-assessment of performance is not contentious </p>

</p>
<p>at all among law schools with grading regimes and, for those clinics where 
grading is in place, there is every reason to continually refine and improve 
them.1 Until recently, Australian law schools have had no national set 
of agreed learning outcomes with which to measure their students&rsquo; 
performance in any area of values, legal knowledge or skills, let alone those 
that are more specific to clinical legal education. The 2010 arrival of the 
Threshold Learning Outcomes (TLOs) for Law2 rectified this omission. 
It is now feasible and cost-effective for clinicians to confidently assert 
learning outcomes for their programs that are consistent with the TLOs, 
and to design assessment indicators that relate closely to those outcomes. 
What is particularly interesting is the active-voice language used by the 
TLOs: they ask legal educators to define learning outcomes in terms such 
as &lsquo;demonstrate&rsquo; and &lsquo;be able to&rsquo;, phrases that are well suited to the day-
to-day scrutiny that supervisors bring to students&rsquo; activities inside clinics. 
This qualitative language also sensibly allows for the possibility of grading 
while avoiding any insistence on metric measurement of &lsquo;demonstration&rsquo; 
or &lsquo;ability&rsquo;. 
</p>
<p>The architecture set by the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF),3 
which requires of LLB graduates a Level 7 achievement of &lsquo;broad and 
coherent knowledge and skills for professional work&rsquo;,4 is also essentially 
consistent with many current assessment practices in Australian clinics, 
as&nbsp;we discuss later in this chapter. 
</p>
<p>This chapter begins with a short discussion of the results of the regional 
reporting process in the Best Practices project described in Chapter 1. 
Our&nbsp; research shows that while assessment practices are quite diverse 
around Australia, with some being very sophisticated, much clinical 
assessment tends to the basic, intuitive and generalised rather than being 
developed systematically from the learning objectives of the particular 
course. There is little explicit pedagogy in assessment, and too few law 
schools have internally coherent assessment routines for their clinical

<p>courses. The&nbsp; strongest divergence of opinion occurred in relation to 
whether to grade students&rsquo; performance beyond pass/fail, and we discuss 
the arguments for and against both approaches. Our research led to 
a&nbsp;series of recommended best practices for clinical assessment. We discuss 
the main themes of these best practices below. They lead into a wider 
discussion of the international and Australian literature about assessment 
practices for different types of clinics. The chapter concludes with 
a&nbsp;discussion of several underlying and important themes that emerge from 
our consideration of this important aspect of clinical method.
</p>
<p>Australian clinicians&rsquo; views on assessment: 
The contributions of our survey to 
best practices
In considering the debates about clinical assessment and their proper 
place in developing the best practices, it was important to survey what 
happens in Australian clinical programs and what Australian clinicians 
think about assessment issues. As the following section makes clear, there 
is little consistency or reflection on assessment pedagogy, and even less 
awareness of that gap.
</p>
<p>All of the outcomes contained in the TLOs5 are well suited to various 
types of clinical experience and live client clinics can achieve all of them, a 
reality that only a few highly innovative law schools have fully exploited.6 
However, survey respondents did not explicitly refer to these high-level 
outcomes, even though many were likely to be achieving some or all of 
them in practice. 
</p>
<p>Respondents were asked for their opinions about seven discrete 
areas involving assessment of students: levels of sensitivity to clients 
and communication; ethics and ethics awareness; intellectual grasp 
of&nbsp; substantive law/practical implementation; drafting, negotiation 
and advocacy skills; self-organisational ability; sociolegal awareness; 
and,&nbsp;finally, their comprehension of law reform processes.

</p>
<p>The edited responses7 are instructive chiefly because they show 
respondents&rsquo; fairly limited ability to articulate learning outcomes, as 
opposed to describing techniques and approaches to the mechanics of 
assessment. In quite a number of areas, respondent clinicians across the 
country said they did not attempt assessment in the designated area of 
enquiry. Clinical components of doctrinal courses are not listed in the 
table; they were identified for assessment purposes only in relation to 
sensitivity to client communication and ethics awareness, and for both 
criteria assessment occurred only through student reflection, for example, 
in a reflective journal.
</p>
<p>Some minor differences were observable between regions. However, 
very&nbsp; often, clinicians appear to rely on their intuition in deciding if 
a&nbsp;student is achieving in a particular area and do not think it necessary to 
articulate the basis on which they exercised that intuition. These clinicians 
may, of course, have had explicit internal criteria for measuring different 
areas of achievement, but they did not see the need to be too precise in 
their responses. Only in a few cases were possible assessment standards 
articulated in a way that showed an awareness of the need to measure 
something according to expressed criteria, even though the survey 
questions asked for details of both techniques used and opinions as to 
appropriate assessment standards. 
</p>
<p>Approaches to assessment criteria in 
different&nbsp;types&nbsp;of&nbsp;clinical&nbsp;experience
</p>
<p>Edited responses from all regions
Clinical programs in all regions of Australia are likely, in varying degrees, 
to be addressing quite appropriate learning outcomes and attempting to 
conscientiously assess their achievement or otherwise. However, most 
clinician respondents did not say that they recognised the critical need to 
directly connect their own assessment regime to those learning outcomes. 
On the contrary, respondents identified a range of disparate practices that 
they thought were relevant to measuring different learning outcomes.

</p>
<p>For example, in relation to assessing students&rsquo; perceived levels of sensitivity 
to clients and the effectiveness of their client communication within 
in-house clinics, respondents referred to a diverse group of techniques 
and concepts:
</p>
<p>establish relationship with students and through this assess against 
standards of the supervisor
</p>
<p>[observe] the way students talk to clients
</p>
<p>[use] reflective journaling 
</p>
<p>[note their] instinctive reaction
</p>
<p>[note] the way the student communicates with supervisor &ndash; rely on the 
supervisor to pick up on that
</p>
<p>if you cannot see the student in with the client you rely on how they are 
talking about them
</p>
<p>we assess their reflection [on the clinical process only &ndash; see Chapter 7 
of this book] and what they learn from it themselves, which is probably 
more valuable
</p>
<p>[a] teacher can have a view about how to deal with clients but students&rsquo; 
views could be equally valid
</p>
<p>[conduct] grid and case conferences.8
</p>
<p>In an externship context, respondents had a very different and perhaps less 
sophisticated set of approaches to the same assessment need, as reflected 
in these comments:
</p>
<p>[consider] feedback from solicitors 
</p>
<p>sometimes informed by client feedback
</p>
<p>[the] supervisor rates the students&rsquo; communication skills
</p>
<p>[the] academic supervisor does not assess these qualities. A way to do 
so would be to measure whether a student listens to the client, [noting] 
whether they responded to the client&rsquo;s questions, [and] whether they 
showed empathy.9 
</p>
<p>8  These techniques and concepts are edited and paraphrased from recorded responses to the 
regional surveys. See footnote 7.

</p>
<p>The general state of awareness of the need for explicit assessment criteria 
for each identified learning outcome appears highly variable, ranging 
from the sophisticated, in highly organised clinics, to minimalist or non-
existent in those with less history, less funding and fewer connections 
to the law school. The following main themes of Best Practices relating 
to&nbsp;clinical assessment are a part of the remedy for those deficiencies.
</p>
<p>Preliminary statement
Clinical legal education courses offered by law schools can and should be 
assessed. This can be done in many ways including, where appropriate, 
overall clinic performance and performance of specific tasks within 
particular clients&rsquo; cases, essays on points of law arising in clinic cases, 
reflective journals, the quality of court advocacy on behalf of clients, 
observation of students&rsquo; performance in common simulated scenarios 
based on prior cases, the quality of law reform submissions and vivas 
based on the content of much of this previously submitted work.10 Clinics 
can support students to achieve deep and active learning through the 
timely provision of feedback to them. Clinical assessment is most helpful 
when provided in a constructive manner, in close proximity to the actions 
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;students. 
</p>
<p>After considering the results of our survey, we determined that best 
practice requires the alignment of assessment tasks with identified 
learning outcomes, and the use of both formative (developmental) and 
summative (concluding) assessment. Considering the strength of views on 
the issue, we also concluded that assessment could be conducted on either 
a graded or pass/fail basis, providing that both approaches offer detailed 
summative and written feedback. We also thought it important to avoid 
standardising algorithms and to ensure that final mark moderation occurs 
through peer supervisor discussion.

</p>
<p>Literature on assessment purposes 
and techniques 
Our consideration of the link between best practice and what actually 
happens in clinics has also been influenced by the writing of many 
scholars in Australia and overseas. Their views, summarised in the 
following section, have allowed us to be confident that recommended best 
practices for assessment are internally consistent, pedagogically sound, 
and reasonably achievable.
</p>
<p>In this section, we discuss scholarship dealing with several important 
issues in clinical assessment. Scholars&rsquo; general concerns around assessment 
issues are numerous and varied. The best place to begin, as we discussed 
in Chapter 4, is with the impact of Stuckey&rsquo;s proper insistence on aligning 
assessment with learning outcomes. This is followed by the debate about 
grading versus pass/fail, then by discussion of the pressure to standardise 
clinical assessment, formative and summative assessment in clinics, and 
how and what to assess in clinical performance. 
</p>
<p>Each of these issues has implications for best practice, although not all are 
on law schools&rsquo; &lsquo;must discuss&rsquo; list. 
</p>
<p>A well-established United States clinician, Anthony Amsterdam, sums up 
the distinction between &lsquo;conventional&rsquo; or academic teaching and clinical 
teaching in this way: &lsquo;The academic teacher seeks to enrich understanding 
of the general by deriving abstract principles from the particular; the 
clinician seeks to enrich understanding of the general by refining a&nbsp;capacity 
to discern the full context of the particular.&rsquo;11
</p>
<p>This distinction is commendable, although today many academic teachers 
and clinicians would say they use both approaches. Clinicians often help 
their students to generalise from their clients&rsquo; cases, just as conventional 
teachers increasingly look for and provide a &lsquo;real world&rsquo; context in 
explaining particular principles. But for both conventional teachers and 
clinicians, refining students&rsquo; capacity to discern &lsquo;the full context&rsquo; is no 
small task, particularly when it comes to assessing the depth of their 
understanding of the real world. Clinical teaching may well make it easier 
to investigate more &lsquo;depth&rsquo; in issues and cases than is possible in classrooms 
with case reports, but the assessment of that depth of knowledge, in all

</p>
<p>the colour and shade of context, is complex. Though many have reflected 
on assessment, our research shows that clinicians themselves are uncertain 
about what can be clinically assessed, how best to do it and, in particular, 
whether graded assessments are legitimate in a clinical setting. There are 
few who can cut through that haze, but one of those is Roy Stuckey.
</p>
<p>Best practices in United States legal 
education: Grading beyond pass/fail
Although Stuckey has focused on the United States&rsquo; approach to legal 
education,12 his often critical observations are highly relevant to other 
systems of legal education. 
</p>
<p>Stuckey is dismissive of grading in the context of first-year United States 
students&rsquo; law courses,13 and is also clear about the deficiencies of much 
clinical grading in the United States: 
</p>
<p>In many in-house clinics and externships, grades are based mostly on 
the subjective opinion of one teacher who supervises the students&rsquo; work. 
Grades in these courses tend to reflect an appraisal of students&rsquo; overall 
performance as lawyers, not necessarily what they learned or how their 
abilities developed during the course. When written criteria are given 
to students, they tend to be checklists that cover the entire spectrum 
of lawyering activities without any descriptions of different levels of 
proficiency.
</p>
<p>Virtually no experiential education courses give written tests or otherwise 
try to find out if students are acquiring the knowledge and understandings 
that the courses purport to teach. Items that could be clearly subjected 
to more objective testing include students&rsquo; understanding of theories of 
practice or particular aspects of law, procedure, ethics and professionalism. 
A student&rsquo;s understanding of many aspects of law practice as well as their 
lifelong learning skills could also be assessed, for example, by asking them 
to analyze recordings or transcripts of lawyers&rsquo; performances. Serious 
efforts to assess student learning in experiential learning courses are not 
being made on any large scale.14

</p>
<p>In Australian clinics, it is common for students to have several supervisors 
for different aspects of their clinical experience. So it is not possible to 
apply United States practice to Australia uncritically, but the warning 
about one-dimensional and limited assessment practices is still relevant. 
Discussion about the dimensions of assessment can become very energetic. 
In Australia there is little contest around whether to assess students at 
all (decided, it seems by default, in the affirmative), but there has been 
a longstanding debate (and divergent practice) about whether students&rsquo; 
performance should be graded beyond the initial classifications of fail or 
pass. Simon Rice has written perhaps the most impassioned and articulate 
article in Australian clinical legal education, in which he has argued for 
pass/fail grades only,15 and that approach continues at the clinical courses 
run through Kingsford Legal Centre and some of the other clinical courses 
in the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Faculty of Law. But, to 
date, only a few other law schools have followed this course of action and, 
with the passage of time and the demands of students for competitive 
advantage over their peers, it is unlikely that pass/fail assessment will gain 
the allegiance of a majority of law schools. Clinicians need support for 
their programs from their more &lsquo;conventional&rsquo; teaching colleagues, and 
a&nbsp;decision to move to pass/fail assessment might risk that support. 
</p>
<p>Rice&rsquo;s views are, however, influential, and led us to take an open position 
on the merits of grading clinical performance. He regards assessment as 
important, but not grades:
</p>
<p>On recognising effort, teachers will often want to acknowledge a student&rsquo;s 
efforts, or to confirm a student&rsquo;s lack of effort, and would feel frustrated 
if not able to. This does not, of itself, lead to a subject being graded. 
Grading is only one, and not a necessary, means of a teacher&rsquo;s expressing 
encouragement or concern. Grading is a simple and simplistic mechanism. 
I suspect that it is attractive to teachers precisely because it is unspecific 
and impersonal.16

<p>188
</p>
<p>Rice does not deny the importance that students themselves place on 
grading,17 but considers that clinics offer their own attraction and students 
do not require grades in order to enrol in a clinic.18 He asserts that what is 
needed and is sufficient in clinical assessment is a calculation as to whether 
student awareness has been achieved or not. If students reach adequate 
awareness, then they should pass:
</p>
<p>my learning objective of the study of justice, for which I choose clinical 
method &hellip; This learning objective, I concede, can be measured. In fact 
it might usefully be measured if the goal is a student&rsquo;s attainment of an 
awareness they did previously not have. What might be best is a before 
and after snapshot of understandings and awareness, to confirm the 
occurrence of change, and hence the achievement of the learning goal. 
But that is to assess, not to grade.19
</p>
<p>The difficulty in this formulation is that students&rsquo; awareness is of a&nbsp;layered, 
multifaceted and context-rich quality. It may be possible to say that 
a&nbsp;student has reached sufficient awareness to pass a clinical course, but that 
judgment does not deny or necessarily rule out lower and higher levels of 
awareness. There is debate in some areas of experiential legal education as 
to whether it is possible to go beyond pass/fail assessment. For example, in 
relation to the acquisition of skills, practical legal training (PLT) providers 
have commented that pass/fail is all that can be asserted. Their argument 
is that, in a PLT environment at least, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t grade practical training at 
say 85% because the 15% is the risk zone and you can&rsquo;t advise clients with 
a specified % of risk. The advice is either competent or not &ndash; [practising 
lawyers] must service the client and the client&rsquo;s needs&rsquo;.20 
</p>
<p>It must be emphasised, however, that sufficiency and insufficiency are also, 
logically understood, themselves grades. To assess anything as adequate 
(a&nbsp; pass) or inadequate (a fail) involves determining one of two grades. 
And&nbsp;if it is necessary to make that choice, then is this not grading?

&lsquo;In&nbsp;1991, in a Kingsford Legal Centre Student Survey almost 60% of graduates of the clinic preferred 
pass/fail to graded assessment.&rsquo;
18  Simon Rice, cited at footnote 15, 2: &lsquo;The Brustin and Chavkin research, at 313, showed that &ldquo;the 
majority of students would have registered for clinic regardless of whether performance was graded on

</p>
<p>But this issue of students&rsquo; awareness or confusion is Rice&rsquo;s derivative, not 
primary, point. He is very clear, echoing Stuckey and many other legal 
educators, that learning outcomes must be reflected in assessment&mdash;
and his preferred primary clinical learning outcome is the achievement 
of a level of awareness of justice and injustice.21 From that perspective, 
Rice is making an argument for assessment-without-grading since, 
if clinical legal education is concerned to focus on justice and process 
(&lsquo;from instrumentation to empowerment&rsquo;), then it must avoid a vision of 
law and lawyering&mdash;including competitive grades&mdash;that still dominates 
conventional classroom instruction.22
</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to see anything offensive in recognising that 
awareness involves shades of grey rather than only black or white. The 
real world of justice and injustice is not one of black and white&mdash;grey is 
everywhere. For example, it is difficult to point out to a student exactly 
how their comprehension of the justice process is mixed or in what precise 
way their understanding of the effect of poverty on client recidivism is 
patchy, but these are common situations where students&rsquo; awareness may be 
adequate but not superior. Setting out where improvements are desirable 
is a formative responsibility of clinical supervision and it is perhaps a bit 
churlish not to recognise, at the end of the semester, students&rsquo; differing 
progress towards higher states of awareness. 
</p>
<p>Rice also makes another important point: it should be enough for adequate 
clinical achievement that a student is in effect &lsquo;on the move&rsquo;, since when 
can anyone of us be said to have sufficiently &lsquo;arrived&rsquo;? 
</p>
<p>The language of the learning goal is of process, not result, of moving, 
not of having arrived. The goal is not the attainment of a measurable 
degree of knowledge of theories of justice, it is the students&rsquo; [degree of ] 
internalising of the fact of power, their sense that they are becoming a part 
of a system whose currency is power, their awareness of their place in law, 
and their potential as lawyers.23 
</p>
<p>In this quotation the parenthesised &lsquo;degree of &rsquo; is added to beg the quantum 
question. Rice is content to say that such &lsquo;internalising&rsquo; is a binary state. 
In practice, it is doubtful whether students can identify such a neat state,

</p>
<p>though all experienced clinicians are required to decide if they think that 
sufficient student internalising has occurred. The point is that, if capable of 
deciding whether an initial &lsquo;pass grade&rsquo; of internalising has been achieved, 
clinicians can go on to decide if deeper internalising has also occurred, 
and award higher grades. Put this way, goals can address both process and 
results. And if that is possible, and appropriate propositional criteria are 
developed that reflect learning outcomes accommodating deeper levels of 
awareness or internalising, then why should that not be fostered?
</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Rice is not convinced that clinicians should grade beyond 
pass/fail, even if they can do so at a technical level, because the necessary 
level of supervisor intrusion is essentially immoral: 
</p>
<p>Grading cannot respect the internal and personal nature of the learning 
we are bringing to the students. The clinical experience makes demands 
of their emotional intelligence and they will respond to it in different 
ways and to different degrees. Because there is difference does not mean 
the difference should be measured. It is simply difference. It is not better 
or worse.24
</p>
<p>There may be no satisfactory answer to this charge of intrusion and, if so, 
group agnosticism on the merit of grading beyond pass/fail is appropriate. 
But clinical supervisors within the one clinic must adopt the same 
approach and, ideally, they will support that approach intellectually and 
emotionally. 
</p>
<p>International practice is also relevant. Hyams has surveyed such practices 
and ultimately supports grading beyond pass/fail:
</p>
<p>It has also been argued that clinics are intended to be safe environments 
for students to experiment, satisfy curiosity and explore their own values, 
assumptions and motivations. [citation omitted] Grading students may 
interfere with the non-judgmental environment, [citation omitted] 
inhibiting students&rsquo; desire to explore and test themselves for fear of 
&lsquo;getting it wrong&rsquo; and consequently losing marks. Further, it may be an 
additional source of stress and preoccupation for students in an already 
stressful environment. [citation omitted]

<p>Alternatively, grading may have the opposite effect on students &ndash; it can 
have a motivational effect and lead to a higher level of professionalism.

<p>labour that students contribute to their clinical work. Finally, there is 
always the &lsquo;external&rsquo; issue of the academic credibility of the clinic. Grading 
makes a statement to both the students and the faculty that clinic has as 
much academic rigour as other &lsquo;black letter law&rsquo; units and students will 
be subjected to the same exacting regime as their other units of study. 
[citation omitted]
</p>
<p>Brustin and Chavkin&rsquo;s rigorous investigation led them to conclude that 
there are &lsquo;tangible benefits&rsquo; to grade students in clinical courses which, 
they believed, may improve the pedagogical process and augment service 
delivery to clients. [citation omitted]25
</p>
<p>Since other academics tend to have a simplistic and sometimes sceptical 
(perhaps cynical) view of clinic assessment, defensible assessment has 
become an important symbol of clinic credibility within the wider law 
school. That political dimension ought not to be forgotten.
</p>
<p>As Stuckey reminds us, however, the decision as to whether higher grades 
are appropriate must, in the end, come back to a clinic&rsquo;s agreed learning 
outcomes.26 And he is notable for his insistence on defining outcomes well 
in advance of any student commencement in a clinic. This pre-definition 
task includes being very clear about the minutiae of the criteria to be used 
to measure adequate and higher levels of achievement, not just to limit 
the potential for vaguely defined grading but fundamentally to make self-
learning possible and empowering:
</p>
<p>We can improve the quality of our assessments by following the approach 
used in other disciplines of developing and disclosing criteria-referenced 
assessments. Criteria-referenced assessments rely on detailed, explicit 
criteria that identify the abilities students should be demonstrating 
(for&nbsp;example, applying and distinguishing cases) and the bases on which 
the instructor will distinguish among excellent, good, competent, or 
incompetent performances [citation omitted] &hellip; The use of criteria 
minimizes the risk of unreliability in assigning grades.27 
</p>
<p>Stuckey might prefer that clinical assessment were pass/fail only, and 
his arguments make it clear that this is not just because the dominant 
objective of United States legal education is to prepare students for a career

<p>in private legal practice where formal grades of law school achievement 
become professionally less important than word-of-mouth reputation. 
But he realises that grading is what happens in law schools and proposes 
ways and means to improve its reliability and validity:
</p>
<p>The use of clear criteria helps students understand what is expected of 
them as well as why they receive the grades they receive. Even more 
importantly, it increases the reliability of the teacher&rsquo;s assessment by 
tethering the assessment to explicit criteria rather than the instructor&rsquo;s 
gestalt sense of the correct answer or performance. The criteria should be 
explained to students long before the students undergo an assessment. 
This enhances learning and encourages students to become reflective, 
empowered, self-regulated learners.28
</p>
<p>Formative and summative assessment 
in clinics
Much is now made of the distinction between formative and summative 
assessment in all education. Legal education is no exception. But in 
clinical contexts the distinction may be less important to the extent that 
formative and summative assessment can blend into each other, except 
for the purpose of developing detailed criteria for assessment. A United 
Kingdom legal educator observes that:
</p>
<p>The difference between formative and summative assessment is often an 
area of concern for law teachers. The essence of formative assessment is that 
undertaking the assessment constitutes a learning experience in its own 
right. Writing an essay or undertaking a class presentation, for example, 
can be valuable formative activities as a means of enhancing substantive 
knowledge as well as for developing research, communication, intellectual 
and organisational skills. Formative assessment is not often included in the 
formal grading of work, and indeed many believe that it should not be.

</p>
<p>In contrast, summative assessment is not traditionally regarded as having 
any intrinsic learning value. It is usually undertaken at the end of a 
period of learning in order to generate a grade that reflects the student&rsquo;s 
performance. The traditional unseen end of module examination is often 
presented as a typical form of summative assessment.29
</p>
<p>Clinical assessment &lsquo;events&rsquo; tend to be more diverse and more frequent than 
assessments in conventional law teaching. In live client clinics they range 
from the fairly mechanical examination of file maintenance standards 
(that is, the degree to which client instructions are comprehensibly 
and accurately recorded, the comprehension, legibility and detail of file 
notes, the evidence of relevant legal research, the grammatical quality of 
letters, briefs and written advocacy), to more specific measures associated 
with the quality of client interviewing and representation (for example, 
client and fellow supervisor feedback, observation of test interviews, 
observations of interpersonal skills, portfolios of written case reports and 
the outcomes of hearings) and, finally (as we discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 7), to supervisors&rsquo; overall judgments about the quality of the 
process of students&rsquo; self-reflection in their learning journals. As we strongly 
emphasised in Chapter 7, assessment of reflection for this limited purpose 
is justified. Less tangible qualities, such as clinic attendance, participation, 
improvement and effort, are also important in these final judgments. Each 
of these categories of assessment should be considered for both formative 
and summative purposes.30
</p>
<p>In externships, some or all of these criteria are also available and, in 
simulated clinical experiences, it is also possible to standardise formative 
assessments with strictly comparable case scenarios and narrowly defined 
instructions to students as to expected performances. 
</p>
<p>In most cases, clinicians wish to assess both students&rsquo; developmental 
learning process and the work they actually create, but it is important for 
all the above reasons to be clear about the distinction. Different&nbsp;measures 
can be better for different objectives: journals are popular for assessing

<p>learning development, and case outcomes obviously allow some 
judgments about overall performance, but the interaction between these 
methods is also instructive and can allow assessment of the capacity to 
reflect. For example, a student who obtains a reduced penalty in a lower 
court criminal case by declining to remind a magistrate of a known 
prior conviction might well claim a &lsquo;successful&rsquo; outcome, but if their 
journal entry on the same case contains no awareness that they have been 
reflecting on any implicit deception of the court process&mdash;that is, they do 
not appear to reflect on whether it is appropriate or justified to rely on 
the silence of the prosecution in such cases&mdash;then it might be considered 
that their understanding of the reflection process is itself underdeveloped. 
Comparing the apparent insights of different assessment approaches 
improves the definition and precision of each individual measure. 
</p>
<p>Assessing student formation can be addressed through some forms of 
feedback, providing clinicians are clear with students in advance as to what 
learning outcomes are at stake and how they will be assessed.31 Feedback 
is discussed carefully in Chapter 6 in relation to supervision, but it is 
important to recognise that it cannot be realistically offered or accepted 
for assessment purposes unless these outcomes are clear to everyone at the 
start of a clinical experience. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, feedback works best as an assessment tool when accompanied 
and&nbsp; supported by students undertaking a variety of self-assessment 
exercises,32 because self-assessment often allows both supervisor and 
student to quickly get to the heart of persistent gaps between desired 
outcomes and actual achievements. These exercises are most useful when 
they contain detailed opportunities not only to discuss a particular 
case file&nbsp; outcome, but also to talk about how the result was achieved 
(for&nbsp;example, the process used to research the law in relation to that case, 
as well as the case result).33

<p>After grading
</p>
<p>Pressure to standardise clinical assessment 
It is now common practice in university assessment regimes to standardise 
results so that the relative performance of a particular cohort of 
students can be measured in a steadily ascending and descending two-
dimensional gradient (or &lsquo;bell curve&rsquo; or grading bands), with relatively 
few &lsquo;fails&rsquo;, a&nbsp;considerable number of modest &lsquo;passes&rsquo; and &lsquo;credits&rsquo; (the top 
of the bell or in the highest band) and relatively few very high grades. 
The&nbsp;standardising&nbsp;process is intended to smooth out anomalous high and 
low results that can be attributed to assessment error. 
</p>
<p>Standardising is achieved by applying an algorithm (an equation) to a set 
of results and modifying each result to a greater or lesser extent to fit the 
institutional expectation as to how many students in an average cohort 
should fail, pass, pass very well and achieve distinction. 
</p>
<p>The exact dimensions of each bell curve are very much the result 
of a policy decision by the law school and to that extent are artificial. 
However, they still represent well-intentioned attempts to limit inherent 
inaccuracies in conventional assessment of particular courses, particularly 
when that assessment is restricted to relatively few and crude measures 
of performance where teachers and students have comparatively little 
personal interaction.
</p>
<p>On occasion, law schools can decide on a one-size-fits-all approach and, 
where the assessment regime is greater than pass/fail, apply general course 
algorithms to clinical courses. This is not a good idea, for several reasons. 
First, the algorithms applied to standardise assessment are commonly 
based on a mathematical premise that there will be a minimum number 
of students in each cohort, usually at least 50 and preferably many more. 
This is an application of the general statistical truth that the bigger the 
sample, the more reliable the analysis. If the cohort is too small, then 
the mathematics of the algorithm will demand too big an alteration in 
the marks of both very poorly performing and very strongly performing 
students. In other words, the ends of the bell curve will be distorted so 
that, instead of a bell shape, the gradient can tend to look much more like 
a rectangle, with the possibility of fewer fails and fewer high marks. Since 
most clinical courses tend to have many fewer than 50 students in any one 
cohort, an algorithm can result in unfair final assessment.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>196
</p>
<p>Secondly, clinical method is a premier method of learning and teaching. 
It is intensive, with frequent one-on-one teacher/student interaction. 
Much clinical work by nature engages students&rsquo; hearts and minds in the 
problems of their clients, triggering a personal desire to perform. Typically, 
this personal element translates into significantly higher performance and 
the wider community notices them and their law school. Law schools 
increasingly see good clinics as important for their overall reputation and 
expect their students will achieve a great deal in a relatively short period 
of time. They invest in that expectation by providing a high staff&ndash;student 
ratio, and they expect their clinical students to work in and excel in 
highly collaborative professional environments. In that preparation-for-
work team culture, another essential bell curve premise&mdash;that of highly 
individualised performance&mdash;is misplaced. A clinical bell curve embodies 
a contradiction, for this reason. 
</p>
<p>Thirdly&mdash;and whether or not the particular algorithm in a clinical 
course is unfair or misconceived&mdash;clinical students&rsquo; complaints about 
the substantial differences between their &lsquo;raw&rsquo; mark and their lower 
standardised mark&mdash;which can amount to 10 to 12 marks&mdash;can quickly 
snowball into systemic criticisms of the course. Since clinical courses 
often contain highly motivated, self-selecting students who receive 
much personal and highly targeted formative assessment through close 
supervision, the opportunities for student improvement and performance 
success are substantial. In a real sense, clinics with close supervision and 
mentoring arrangements could be said to be engaged in continuing 
assessment. High raw marks are common, and no law school can easily 
justify a substantial reduction in marks and be perceived by students to be 
competent and caring of students&rsquo; experiences. 
</p>
<p>Fourthly, clinical courses&mdash;as is the case with many electives&mdash;are courses 
where students do better because they are choosing what to study. A bell 
curve does not recognise this. 
</p>
<p>Fifthly, and more fundamentally, clinical assessment is perhaps the most 
thorough and personal process that a law student will ever encounter. 
It is profoundly formative, personal and individual and contains no 
conceptual assessment gap requiring the generalised &lsquo;rescue remedy&rsquo; of an 
algorithm. Clinical assessment tends to be accurate because, on average, 
each student is well known to their teachers.</p>

</p>
<p>Strengthening formation&mdash;recognising metacognition
While student reflection contributes to the wider concept of formation, 
the assessment of that formation requires some specific discussion, 
particularly if clinicians are to help students shift their focus during 
a&nbsp;clinical semester from producing a specific activity (for example, a brief 
to counsel, advocacy letter or written negotiation strategy) towards the 
process of their own current and future learning.
</p>
<p>The objective here is to assess the degree or otherwise of students&rsquo; growing 
understanding of their most effective learning process&mdash;that is, their 
&lsquo;metacognition&rsquo; of how they learn best now and how they will learn 
best once in paid employment. Essentially, this is a reflective activity 
(see Chapter 7). The understanding and embedding of metacognitive 
awareness is emphasised by both Stuckey&rsquo;s Best Practices34 and the 
Carnegie Report35 as critically important to revitalising legal education in 
general. It is highly significant for legal education as a whole that clinical 
methods are tailor-made to achieve the best in students&rsquo; metacognition.36 
Hyams&nbsp;observes that: 
</p>
<p>Self-reflection is a large part of the focus of clinical pedagogy in the US 
and is a key aspect of the teaching in various US clinics &hellip; The skill of 
self-reflection is often implicit in clinic work and is used by clinicians 
to assist students with their metacognitive abilities. By asking a student: 
&lsquo;How&nbsp;would you go about finding the resolution to this dispute? What 
might be the appropriate approach?&rsquo; and &lsquo;How would you do this 
differently next time?&rsquo;, we are achieving a dual purpose: 1. modelling 
a&nbsp;lawyering practice which is careful and reflective, and 2. providing tools 
for improving metacognition (that is, problem solving) skills.37
</p>
<p>Formative assessment is the best way, and possibly the only cost-effective 
way, to tackle that objective within clinics. Niedwiecki states it simply: 
&lsquo;Essentially, the goal of formative assessment should be to move legal 
education away from a focus on an end product&mdash;a memorandum, 
motion,&nbsp; negotiation, oral argument, etc.&mdash;to the underlying process 
of&nbsp;developing these products.&rsquo;38

</p>
<p>Metacognition is not difficult to grasp. Many students instinctively 
understand what is meant by it once they have examples in front of them. 
It includes basic areas of self-knowledge, for example, knowing what sort 
of physical environment (quiet/noisy, light/dark, close to others/separate 
from others) is best for an individual lawyer when trying to comprehend 
new written material. It also covers more cerebral issues such as visual 
versus text-based learning preferences and knowing when to revise and 
how to self-test one&rsquo;s own comprehension. Niedwiecki provides this 
description:
</p>
<p>Essentially, metacognition is the ability to regulate and control one&rsquo;s 
learning. There are many definitions of metacognition, but &hellip; put simply, 
it is the process of &lsquo;thinking about thinking&rsquo; and the ability to self-
regulate one&rsquo;s learning with the goal of transferring learned skills to new 
situations. There are many metacognitive skills that everyone employs in 
the learning process: monitoring one&rsquo;s reading comprehension, evaluating 
one&rsquo;s process of learning, understanding the influence of outside stimuli 
on one&rsquo;s learning, and knowing when one lacks motivation, just to name 
a few.
</p>
<p>&hellip; Metacognition also can be described as the internal voice people hear 
when they are engaged in the learning process &ndash; the voice that will tell 
them what they have to do to accomplish a task, what they already know, 
what they do not know, how to match their previous learning to the 
new situation, when they do not understand what they are reading or 
learning, and how to evaluate their learning. It is this internal reflection 
and conscious control of the learning process that goes to the heart 
of&nbsp;metacognition.39
</p>
<p>Conclusion
In the current stringent financial climate, conscious decisions to link 
clinical assessment regimes to the learning outcomes of each clinic can 
only strengthen their graduates&rsquo; experience and hence the reputation of 
each clinic. In most law schools it should not be difficult to strengthen 
and realign any clinical assessment regimes that do not approach best 
practice. But assessment of students&rsquo; performance and development is not 
the only dimension to clinical assessment.

<p>It will also be necessary in time to assess clinical programs as a whole. 
Evans and Hyams have already jumped the boundary fence to some 
degree and made a case for periodic review and assessment of each 
clinic.40 The&nbsp;potential positive flow-on effect to the particular law school 
is already well established. Law schools&rsquo; investment in coming to grips 
with assessment pedagogy and then applying it consistently, not just to 
students&rsquo; efforts but to their entire programs, is therefore an investment 
in the reputation and viability of the law school itself.

Resourcing live client clinics
</p>
<p>Introduction
In this chapter, we rely on the insights of respondents to the Best Practices 
survey to inform the discussion of various dimensions of clinical program 
resourcing. All are related to the distinctive politics of Australian law 
school funding. Best practices in clinical legal education programs are 
the main focus of this book, and we deal with the full range of clinical 
models. In Chapter 3 we discussed all the models but, unless otherwise 
made plain, &lsquo;clinic&rsquo; in this chapter refers only to the live client learning 
setting, whether in-house or in an externship.
</p>
<p>After discussing the directions identified by the survey and stakeholder 
input, we address the important role of strategic direction, on which the 
overall impact of a clinical program often depends. In a live client clinic 
of any sort, whether in-house or external, there is a profound need for 
clinic administrators with both strong interpersonal skills and a detailed 
capacity to manage money. But the core resources of an effective clinic 
are the clinical supervisors&mdash;the individual lawyers or cross-disciplinary 
supervisors who personally direct, guide and nurture law students through 
the maze of their own &lsquo;growth&rsquo; and its interaction with the learning 
objectives. 
</p>
<p>Only when these central role descriptions are on track will the clinical 
program have any chance of making a profound difference to learning 
and, where it is provided, to service delivery. But infrastructure issues 
remain important. Adequate funding for clinical programs is a recurring </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>202
</p>
<p>headache for law school deans because of the demands of competing 
interest groups within law schools. Indeed, some law schools are still to 
be persuaded that superior legal education involves clinical integration 
in one way or another. There is also an obvious need to ensure that the 
clinical legal practice can operate to deliver both immediate and longer-
term legal needs in the same way that any legal practice does&mdash;and 
this means all the compliance-related infrastructure of ethical systems, 
insurance, information technology (IT) resourcing and the like. 
</p>
<p>In respect of infrastructure (in effect, the funding of the clinic), Best Practices 
gives attention to insurance, training, IT/library access, administrative 
and locum support and the need to formalise the relationships between 
any external agency and the law school in relation to the full range of 
issues arising from clinical service delivery. 
</p>
<p>Apart from Giddings&rsquo; recent major work on clinical sustainability,1 
there is very little other Australian scholarship on clinical quality and 
accountability.2 Clinical funding remains tenuous. While almost all 
universities think they need a law school regardless of its cost, not all law 
schools see their clinical programs as indispensable. In this climate, the 
critical need for clinical leadership can never be underestimated, especially 
leadership that is emotionally and tactically sensitive to the political 
struggles inside law schools. 
</p>
<p>In the survey responses, infrastructure concerns almost always 
concentrated on the cost of running a program, and the slightly anxious 
desire to see that adequate professional indemnity and other insurances 
were fully provided by each law school. The Regional Reports make it 
clear that clinical programs consider their funding to be less than ideal in 
one way or another. These include the differences in salaries for different 
types of supervisors, inadequate funds for IT equipment and cramped 
physical conditions, even among those apparently successful clinical sites. 
Few respondents engaged in detailed reflection on sustainability concerns,

<p>but the impacts of periodic changes in law school leadership, external 
agency needs, required service delivery reviews and the uncertainties 
of&nbsp;government legal aid funding were a common underlying reality. 
</p>
<p>Clinic supervisors 
Resourcing clinical legal education appropriately is not just a matter of 
money. It is also a question of recruiting and retaining staff with appropriate 
values, attitudes, skills and energy. To go even further, real success in 
resourcing consists in recruiting &lsquo;good&rsquo; leaders, clinic administrators and 
supervisors. The statement in Best Practices on resourcing is divided into 
two categories, &lsquo;Staff&rsquo; and &lsquo;Infrastructure&rsquo;, in order to emphasise that 
staffing and individuals&rsquo; supervision qualities are not just a subsection 
of infrastructure needs. As we say there: &lsquo;The effectiveness of a clinic 
will depend on the strength and sensitivity of the supervision provided. 
Clinical supervisors require a combination of legal practice backgrounds, 
a concern for improving access to justice and a deep interest in student 
learning.&rsquo;3 
</p>
<p>Supervisors are the main resource of a good clinical program and the 
main challenge. Resourcing these clinics properly requires longevity in 
program leadership, as well as leaders&rsquo; personal acceptance of the need 
for succession planning. These are not contradictory qualities: the best 
clinics are those that have people in leadership who have the personal 
judgment and maturity to comprehend their interrelated nature. Often 
the sustainable, large and well-regarded clinical program is identified 
not just in its outputs&mdash;that is, in its teaching reputation, law reform 
impacts, delivery of services and attraction of funding&mdash;but in the 
broader personal qualities of its key staff. Among clinical supervisors who 
hold conventional academic positions, a key indicator of strength and 
productivity can also be the impact of their writing. Best Practices, as it 
relates to clinical supervisors, therefore responds not only to the depth and 
complexity of their required personal attributes, but also to their teaching 
status as supervisors (see Chapter 6 on supervision), equating them as far 
as possible to law school peers in their pay and conditions, their access 
to training and their relative autonomy. It is particularly important to

<p>recognise the long hours and intensive nature of supervision&mdash;having 
regard to any research and publication expectations&mdash;by controlling the 
number of students for which each supervisor is responsible.
</p>
<p>A well-established clinic, particularly one in an external agency such as 
a&nbsp;community legal centre, may have an overall director and a site director, 
as well as an administrator and clinical supervisors. But it is probably 
more common, especially in an externship program, to find one or two 
lawyers with mixed responsibilities&mdash;partly for their own caseload and 
partly for the supervision of students. Smaller programs may get by with 
just one lawyer/supervisor and a part-time administrator at a single site. In 
our regional surveys, many views were expressed by respondents about the 
range of qualities needed by clinical supervisors.4 Most comments were 
consistent in their listing of a demanding range of personal and professional 
skills and attributes. However, there were some inconsistencies. 
</p>
<p>A number of respondents thought &lsquo;credentials&rsquo; are necessary, so that 
supervisors should have postgraduate qualifications in teaching.5 A few 
respondents were wary of scaring off potential supervisors, whom they 
see as hard to attract into the field, and these respondents thought 
that supervisors do not have to be &lsquo;teachers&rsquo;, as long as they are good 
mentors.6 The difference may be minor, but the general emphasis in 
United States clinics on proficient supervisors as educators and not just 
as practitioners&mdash;together with Australian national efforts to improve the 
quality of all teaching at all levels&mdash;may mean that postgraduate teaching 
qualifications will become a precondition to identifying good clinicians 
as time goes by. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps unconsciously reflecting this awareness, many respondents held 
the view that clinical supervisors are serious educators and need to be 
paid at the same level as &lsquo;conventional&rsquo; teaching colleagues, with the same 
opportunities for career advancement. It is, however, unlikely that equal 
status will occur without comparable ongoing education requirements. 
Only a few respondents seem to be aware that the extensive wish list for

<p>good supervision is related to cost and funding, and that it could affect 
financial sustainability to compare salaries paid to supervisors with those 
paid to the comparatively few supervisors who also hold formal academic 
appointments in the relevant law schools. 
</p>
<p>In the survey responses the attributes of clinic leaders or directors were not 
generally commented on, but one respondent considered people in these 
roles need at least five years post-admission experience, with management 
experience and the capacity to run a legal practice. The following list 
of desirable qualities for supervisors (regardless of the type of clinic) 
is&nbsp;a&nbsp;synthesis of respondents&rsquo; views across all the regions surveyed:
</p>
<p>&bull; Have a practising certificate, current practical experience and a good 
working knowledge of the law.
</p>
<p>&bull; Have excellent lawyering skills (&lsquo;good natural communication and 
supervision skills and experience&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>&bull; Have creativity, empathy and preference for use of plain, clear language.
&bull; Have patience, enthusiasm, compassion, respect for difference 
</p>
<p>and diversity and the maturity to be able to critique work without 
humiliating students.
</p>
<p>&bull; Have the ability to balance stakeholders&rsquo; expectations, so that those 
who are unrealistic are restrained appropriately. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Have good client communication skills (emotional intelligence) and 
the ability to discuss what they are doing and why with both clients as 
individuals and students as individuals.
</p>
<p>&bull; Like people and be interested in people&rsquo;s problems; must like students 
and young people and have a sense of humour.
</p>
<p>&bull; Know how to teach&mdash;have an understanding of reflective practice in 
teaching and learning, measured by achievement of recognised training 
in postgraduate teaching (for example, a formal teaching qualification 
such as a Graduate Certificate of Higher Education), or be trained in 
professional supervision and/or adult education for new staff. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Be aware of the tensions between getting to know students and having 
to assess them and between being organised and being able to prioritise 
supervision within other responsibilities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Have a social justice focus and perspective&mdash;be able to expose students 
to the idea of making the law more just and fair; to influence their 
practice of law in the future.
</p>
<p>&bull; Have ethical awareness.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>206
</p>
<p>&bull; Have sufficient administrative skills (to operate in a quality accountable 
learning/service delivery site).
</p>
<p>&bull; Have an awareness of the clinical and related literature, covering overall 
clinical objectives, teaching technique, policy debates, law reform and 
critical evaluation.
</p>
<p>Clinic program directors 
Sometimes, law school leaders ask if clinical program directors7&mdash;those 
who oversee a whole program rather than just a single clinic&mdash;are actually 
needed. The question is often perceived by clinically aware academic staff 
as unfortunate, but it is understandable because of a perception inside 
law schools that teaching clinic is like any other teaching allocation and 
entails no additional roles or responsibilities. Perhaps, if clinical and 
conventional teaching methods were so well integrated that law academics 
could not distinguish them, it would be appropriate to ask if clinical 
direction is needed. In that world all substantive legal concepts would be 
finding expression in law schools helping to resolve the current problems 
of people, corporations and non-government organisations. But that is 
not the case and, as we discussed in Chapter 2, is unlikely while Australian 
law schools are funded at the lowest Commonwealth band for their LLB 
courses.8 In the meantime, there is a struggle going on for better teaching 
integration of this nature, for external government and philanthropic 
funding of clinic to supplement law school sources, and for the law-in-
context impacts that distinguish good clinical method. 
</p>
<p>Of course, there are program directors who lead single clinics and those 
who oversee multiple clinics, depending on the history and circumstances 
of the law school. But the key issue remains one of clinical leadership, 
which is something more than management or administration.
</p>
<p>7  The term &lsquo;program director&rsquo; is generic. There is a considerable variation. For example, at Monash 
University, the term is &lsquo;Director of Legal Practice Programs&rsquo;, while at Griffith University, there 
is&nbsp;a&nbsp;&lsquo;Director of Professionalism&rsquo;. 
8  JD degrees are another matter of course, since they are funded by students and often make 
money for law schools, in the sense that they effectively subsidise the teaching of LLB students.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>9 . ReSoURCing Live CLienT CLiniCS
</p>
<p>What is involved in clinical leadership?
A broad educational and professional perspective is needed for the best 
in clinical leadership. A clinical director must have a real interest in 
constant liaison with law school senior leadership, seeking opportunities 
to achieve advances for the program as a whole. This connectivity is 
helped if their office is located close to those leaders so that they are &lsquo;in the 
loop&rsquo;: Kingsford Legal Centre, for example, is on the ground floor of the 
University of New South Wales (UNSW) law building. Correspondingly, 
clinic directors who may be located away from the main law school 
building or are obliged to report to CEOs of external agencies in which 
their clinics are located have a more difficult job in staying up to date with 
law school developments.
</p>
<p>The capacity to lead is often witnessed in an ability to create and implement 
new clinics. But clinical leaders will often display many other attributes. 
While clinical supervisors without leadership responsibilities may not 
require an extensive range of skills beyond supervisory competence, that 
is not the case with clinical leadership. 
</p>
<p>With so much dependent on effective clinical direction, a prudent law 
school dean might consider using a search consultant to help recruit a new 
program director, and to utilise modern 360-degree analyses of potential 
appointees, in order to maximise the chances of a successful appointment.
</p>
<p>Externship programs are by definition located inside agencies with 
their own governance arrangements and they may not engage in active 
casework where clients&rsquo; money is transacted. But if the clinical program 
director is also the solicitor formally in charge of a clinic that does handle 
clients&rsquo; money, then they will be required to hold a current, full practising 
certificate regardless of the Australian jurisdiction.9 However, if the roles of 
program director and clinic director are separated (which is often the case 
in larger law schools), then it is only the clinic director&mdash;&lsquo;on the ground&rsquo; 
as it were and directly responsible for such clients&rsquo; files&mdash;who&nbsp;needs to 
have the full certificate. For this reason, it cannot be essential for a clinical 
program director to have a background as a practising lawyer, though 
most applicants for such positions will have this experience. 
</p>
<p>9  A full practising certificate is usually described as one entitling the holder to operate a client 
trust account. See, generally, e.g. Legal Profession Uniform Law Application Act 2014 (Vic), Schedule 
1, Part&nbsp;4.2. </p>

<p>Clinical supervisors (&lsquo;clinicians&rsquo;)
As we emphasised in the introduction to this chapter, the core resource of 
any clinic is its staff and, among those staff, clinical supervisors perform 
the core function&mdash;supervision. It is essentially up to these lawyers to 
effectively communicate the complexities of supervision (see Chapter 6) 
to law students and to oversee their baptism into legal practice. Clinical 
supervisors have a critical role as student mentors and role models; and 
these attributes frame their quality as teachers, technicians and ethical, 
street-aware lawyers. There are few things as important to resourcing 
clinical legal education as the recruitment, selection and retention 
of&nbsp;appropriate clinical supervisors. 
</p>
<p>Of course, supervisors need to be eligible for current practising certificates, 
but there is a more fundamental list of criteria for those who will be able 
not just to practise law, but to teach that practice, to watch over those 
learning to do the same and to impart the socially conscious values that 
are integral to clinical methods. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, good applicants for supervisory roles will be able to meet the 
following selection criteria:10
</p>
<p>&bull; Appropriate experience of legal practice. 
&bull; An understanding of the responsibilities of ethical legal practice, 
</p>
<p>including an awareness of the pedagogical debates concerning 
competing legal ethical perspectives.
</p>
<p>&bull; The capacity to teach by example and encouragement, showing 
emotional intelligence.
</p>
<p>&bull; The willingness to trust students and to set reasonable boundaries 
around that trust so that they feel able to exercise appropriate client-
related initiatives.
</p>
<p>&bull; An understanding of the distinction between normative and positivist 
theories of law (normative theory being that law must be understood 
in the context of its effects on justice; positivist theory being that the 
law simply &lsquo;is&rsquo; and need not be further justified or examined, except 
for its likely capacity to provide loopholes for clients). 
</p>
<p>10  This list is based on a similar list in Adrian Evans, &lsquo;Normative Attractions to Law and their 
Recipe for Accountability and Self-Assessment in Justice Education&rsquo; in Frank Bloch (ed), The Global 
Clinical Movement: Educating Lawyers for Social Justice (2011) Oxford University Press, Chapter 24. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>209
</p>
<p>9 . ReSoURCing Live CLienT CLiniCS
</p>
<p>&bull; An understanding and acceptance that clinical method extends beyond 
skills development to promoting a normative and critical orientation 
in law students.
</p>
<p>&bull; A shared understanding with the clinic as to the base or bases in 
curriculum theory of the clinical program and, in particular, as to 
whether the clinical program is law student&ndash;education centred, 
client-service centred or whether it seeks to foster a conscious balance 
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;two. 
</p>
<p>Training, diversifying, strengthening and retaining 
good clinical supervisors
The strengthening of university expectations of teaching staff is such 
that consideration should be given to appointing clinical supervisors on 
probation for whatever period is common in the law school. During that 
period it is desirable, though not yet required by all law schools, that 
they undertake appropriate assessable teaching education. Typically, this 
will be a relatively short postgraduate teaching diploma of one or two 
years offered by the wider university of which the law school forms a part. 
New&nbsp;supervisors who come from legal practice environments may consider 
this to be prescriptive, but it is not unreasonable to require new teachers 
who are being employed as teachers but have no background in this craft 
to be so educated, particularly if they wish to attract similar employment 
conditions to conventional law teachers. It is also commonplace for 
external supervisors to be appointed, not by a law school but by the 
agency that manages them on a day-to-day basis. Law schools may have 
representatives on selection committees, but their influence will vary. 
In&nbsp; the agency environment, there will often be little encouragement of 
or requirement for training and teaching development among clinicians. 
</p>
<p>Sometimes there will be resistance to the concept of training at any level 
beyond the compulsory, but minimal, levels of continuing professional 
development, particularly if the agency will not or cannot support the 
cost of teacher development. When that resistance is encountered and 
the agency is indifferent or hampered by its own funding, clinic directors 
can lead by example, encourage and try to persuade their colleagues at a 
personal level of the longer-term advantages of participation in teaching 
training. These are slow processes and will not solve an agency&rsquo;s up-skilling </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>210
</p>
<p>issue overnight. However, such processes are consistent with a best practice 
approach that prioritises professional development not just in substantive 
law, but also in the discipline of teaching.
</p>
<p>Probation periods for new staff are universal in law schools and agencies 
and the probation mechanism provides an opportunity to both foster 
the connections of a new clinical supervisor to wider legal education and 
normative lawyering and ensure they are handling the transition as well as 
possible. During probation it is desirable that a new clinic supervisor be 
not merely supervised by the clinic director in an operational manner, but 
also be encouraged to explore their potential for writing and reflecting on 
their clinical supervision. 
</p>
<p>However, encouragement of clinical supervisors to write about their 
experiences, whether they are in-house or in externships, has not been 
well managed by many Australian clinical programs for two reasons. 
First,&nbsp;clinics themselves are still often directed by lawyers who do not have 
backgrounds in writing and are unconvinced that scholarly connections 
are needed or are even desirable. And law schools for their part have not 
all been committed to ensuring that all those teaching their students 
are productive as lawyers as well as productive in terms of research and 
writing. They are still a long way from the integration ideal we spoke 
about in the introduction to this chapter. Indeed, as law schools offer 
more specialised electives in their degree programs and try to save on staff 
cost by employing practising lawyers as sessional and casual teachers, the 
status quo will continue, with sessional teachers and clinical supervisors in 
the same boat. 
</p>
<p>It is nevertheless becoming a norm for law school academics to achieve and 
maintain some sort of &lsquo;research active&rsquo; status. Different law schools have 
different ways of measuring such activity, but minimum annual research 
outputs are not uncommon. Clinical supervisors who seek to be a part of 
the wider law school environment will at some point face these research 
output expectations. In our regional surveys, there were diverse opinions 
among clinical supervisors as to what could reasonably be expected of 
them in terms of research and writing. Most wanted the same employment 
conditions, including research or sabbatical leave&mdash;and the same levels of 
perceived respect&mdash;as conventional university teachers. However, they felt 
there was too little understanding by their law schools of the complexity 
of work associated with clinical case management. They do not always 
see themselves as law teachers at all, and some identify more closely as </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>211
</p>
<p>9 . ReSoURCing Live CLienT CLiniCS
</p>
<p>lawyers who are far busier than (conventional) law teachers because of the 
ever-present reality of client and case deadlines and the need to ensure 
that the responsible students, who have their own challenges, are on top 
of these events on a 24/7 basis.11 On the other hand, the bureaucracies of 
modern law schools and the wider university are effective in exhausting, 
dispiriting and removing &lsquo;conventional&rsquo; law teachers on a regular basis as 
well. Any precision or consensus about who is busier or has more time is 
unlikely because the clinical and substantive law teaching environments 
remain quite different. 
</p>
<p>Clinical programs will also be more successful in retaining good supervisors, 
rather than see them move to other occupations or legal workplaces, if 
they are able to offer them a career track. So, just as the provision of 
good supervision to law students is perhaps the critical ingredient in their 
learning (see Chapter 5), the encouragement of clinicians&rsquo; thinking and 
writing demonstrates to them that they have a future in this discipline. 
Contrary to much present practice, new clinical supervisors in externship 
settings will be strengthened by deliberate linkages to the wider law school, 
such that they expect of themselves over time that they will research and 
write and will actually have fulfilling academic, as well as legal, careers. 
In this way, they will have a means to both combat the physical and 
emotional isolation from which clinical supervisors can suffer and bridge 
the gaps between clinical supervision and conventional law teaching.
</p>
<p>In lobbying within law schools and clinics for greater recognition of 
clinical supervisors, it is worth putting several propositions that will be 
hard to rationally resist: 
</p>
<p>&bull; That integrated clinical programs12 offer best practice legal education 
and that global competition among legal education providers will 
eventually make clinics a point of differentiation among law schools 
(just as is beginning to happen in regional Australian settings). 
</p>
<p>&bull; That career tracks among clinical supervisors are becoming clearer as 
the positive impacts of clinical methods gather more disciples. 
</p>
<p>11  See e.g. Identifying Current Practices in Clinical Legal Education, Regional Report: New South 
Wales and Australian Capital Territory, Section E, at perma.cc/FU7X-5TNV.
12  That is, where substantive, compulsory law subjects utilise clinical methods, including simulation 
and client-topic specific placements of early-year law students in clinics, as a matter of course; where 
these compulsory subjects are also regularly co-taught by clinical supervisors; and where all law school 
teachers, including clinical supervisors, are expected to develop similar capacities in theoretical and 
clinical teaching and in their ability to research and write. </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>212
</p>
<p>&bull; That new clinical supervisors need developmental support in their 
discipline if they are to have a career in clinical supervision and, 
eventually, leadership. 
</p>
<p>&bull; That integrated clinical legal education must eventually mean that 
clinical supervisors themselves have an integrated approach and will 
publish as well as teach and practise law. 
</p>
<p>If all these things are predictable over time, then an expectation of 
reflection and writing by clinical supervisors is not just reasonable, it is an 
investment in continuing clinical integration. 
</p>
<p>Supervisors can be engaged in collaborative, team and multidisciplinary 
supervision of students, so that their understanding of the educational 
possibilities of supervision is deepened. And they will benefit by rotating 
in and out of clinical supervision sites and roles, alternating with 
otherwise conventional law school academics as supervisors, whenever the 
opportunity presents itself.
</p>
<p>Rationales behind clinical supervisor&ndash;student ratios
A key factor in retaining any employee in any job is the workability of 
the role. For clinical supervisors, workability means being responsible 
for the correct or appropriate number of students, but no more. Today, 
clinical supervisors need to &lsquo;[develop] in students a breadth of personal, 
interpersonal and management skills&rsquo;13 that cross over into almost every 
aspect of their human development. Further, the analysis of law in context 
within a specific legal case is more intense than in a traditional doctrinal 
lecture. A relatively high clinical supervisor&ndash;student ratio, ideally at no 
more than 1:8 for a full-time clinical supervisor in an Australian setting, is 
required not just to cope with students&rsquo; caseloads, but also for the necessary 
discussion and reflection process. Significantly lower ratios undermine 
the depth of supervision or lead to burn out among supervisors. To take 
just one example, the supervisor needs to ensure that their students are 
making systemic connections between the drug-using client in their office 
and public policy related to substance addiction as a crime rather than

</p>
<p>a&nbsp;sociomedical problem. It takes time and much concentration to manage 
students&rsquo; critical transfer of clinical insight to effective sociolegal policy 
recommendations and law reform.14
</p>
<p>Each of these activities demands major emotional and energy commitments 
from clinical supervisors year after year. If the supervision ratio required by 
the law school involves too many students, then the attractiveness of the 
role reduces and supervisors depart or, just as unfortunate, conventional 
law teachers have bad experiences and decline to be involved in anything 
but instruction in doctrinal law.
</p>
<p>Funding
Clinical programs containing a clinic (as distinct from those confined 
to&nbsp;simulations or externships that are not engaged in client service) need 
to recognise a legal obligation to adequately resource the legal practice 
that operates in the clinic. For present purposes, the clinic includes the 
legal practice, but the &lsquo;legal practice&rsquo; is in some ways distinct from the 
clinic in the sense that the former consists of the mix of regulatory and 
ethical protocols that a lawyer must provide and operate within. The&nbsp;clinic 
is more than that: it includes the physical facilities that are needed to 
accommodate students, in addition to the lawyers and support staff. 
This obligation may be difficult for the wider law school or university 
to recognise or accept, but it is set out in various pieces of legislation, 
in particular, the legal profession frameworks governing lawyers in all 
jurisdictions.15 These frameworks are developing very slowly into a code, 
most notably in the beginning of a national legislative regime,16 that 
covers a host of issues relevant to the funding of clinics, such as: 
</p>
<p>&bull; The provision of a client trust account, requiring a part-time 
bookkeeper&nbsp;or accountancy-trained administrator and approximately 
$3,000 per year in audit fees; internal safe-keeping facilities (a safe 
or other secure cabinet) for cash, registers of securities and transit

15  For example, see the Legal Profession Uniform Law Application Act 2014 (Vic) (the Uniform&nbsp;Law), 
which has provided a uniform legal regulatory framework that took effect in Victoria and New South 
Wales from 1 July 2015.

</p>
<p>payments, cheque books and related banking records; and risk-
management staff training to prevent fraud and reduce inadvertent 
mistakes in trust accounting.
</p>
<p>&bull; Professional indemnity insurance to offset the risk of lawyer or 
student&nbsp;mistakes in their legal work. For clinics that are a part of the 
community legal service network, such insurance is available through 
the National Association of Community Legal Centres (NACLC) 
at&nbsp;a&nbsp;significant discount.17
</p>
<p>&bull; Continuing professional development (CPD), which typically requires 
each lawyer to undertake 10 hours of education annually in current 
legal issues. At least some of this education will be available only 
at a cost of several hundred dollars per hour per lawyer, but clinics 
commonly organise their own CPD to achieve more targeted delivery 
at a lower cost by drawing on internal and law school academics 
as&nbsp;presenters.
</p>
<p>&bull; Annual practising certificate fees (typically $300&ndash;400 per lawyer per 
year) and contributions to local fidelity funds, which compensate 
clients when their lawyers steal from them (typically $100&ndash;300 per 
lawyer per year for those who work in clinics). Optional law society 
membership can add another $300&ndash;500 per lawyer per year. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Office procedural manuals specific to each clinic, which in turn dictate 
office standards for other documentation covering file maintenance 
(maintaining adequate details and records of each client&rsquo;s matter); 
conflicts registers; complaint handling, secure and fire-safe file 
storage (for a minimum of seven years),18 practising certificate and 
CPD&nbsp;records.
</p>
<p>&bull; Access to an adequate law library (usually through their law school) 
that includes low- or no-cost access to digital &lsquo;how-to-do-it&rsquo; manuals 
that instruct law students in the detail of model case procedures in 
common areas, for example, how to conduct a Magistrates&rsquo; Court/
Local Court case, or how to defend a consumer debtor.19
</p>
<p>17  There are additional costs associated with general compliance: e.g. Directors and Officers 
Liability Insurance for governing board members, recurring occupational health and safety training, 
regular fire drills, maintenance of first aid facilities and public liability insurance.
18  Cloud storage of client information is problematic for lawyers for security reasons. See Christine 
Parker and Adrian Evans, Inside Lawyers&rsquo; Ethics, (2014) Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed, Chapter 
4, 104&ndash;06.

connections between community legal centres and clinics, is one such resource. See e.g. perma.cc/

essential for sustainable clinic operations. A supervisor who routinely returns to work after 
annual leave to find that their students were effectively unsupervised or poorly supervised in

<p>Australian government requires 13m2 for each person employed. Further, since the law 
school will expect and even require a closely related clinic to apply for external funds, it 
ought to seek additional space above and beyond the recommended m2 allowance, to 
cope with the extra accommodation required if external fundraising is successful . note 
that it is not realistic to cost externship accommodation using this measure because the 
organisations in which externships are located will share their own facilities with students, 
other organisations and any external (law school) supervisors.
d gai walker (see footnote 20) suggests also that &lsquo;workstations need to be set up 
appropriately&rsquo; for occupational health purposes, ideally through the university; that 
&lsquo;IT support from the University is invaluable&rsquo; and is far less expensive than through private 
providers. She adds &lsquo;replacement provisions for equipment within the university programs 
is important . interview rooms should be cabled so that a laptop can be taken into the 
room to help with internet access forms &hellip; [and] phone equipment should ALwAYS include 
headsets for EACH phone &hellip; with voicemail on staff phones&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Conclusion
&lsquo;Clinic&rsquo; is perceived to be expensive,21 but that perception is a clich&eacute;d 
consequence of unfair comparisons. The per-student direct cost of 
a&nbsp;large conventional lecture taught by one person to 300 students (or to 
thousands of students, via the massive online open course or MOOC) 
is lower than that of a legal clinic, but both of these delivery methods 
measure direct costs only and presume satisfactory learning outcomes. 
Learning outcomes from conventional lectures may also be focused on 
intellectual understanding. They are as unsuitable to the development 
of lawyers&rsquo; professional expertise as they would be to developing similar 
capacities in hospital residents facing their first nervous exposure to an 
emergency room. Properly resourced clinical programs are perhaps the 
most reliable, holistic and sustainable contributors to future lawyers&rsquo; 
professional competence, versatility and integrity.

Australian best 
</p>
<p>practices&mdash;a comparison 
with the United Kingdom 
</p>
<p>and the United States
</p>
<p>Introduction 
Efforts to develop clinical legal education in Australia, the United 
Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (US) have gradually 
evidenced a common goal: to develop consciously the best practices of 
clinical legal education in each country. In doing so, there is an effort 
to provide clinicians with guidance to improve law student education in 
the essential lawyering skills and in their ability to analyse and critique 
the law and legal system. We use the term &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; throughout 
this book to describe what experience and, to varying degrees depending 
on the country, research have shown to be the most effective practices, 
or approaches, to clinical legal education in the countries compared in 
this chapter. As noted in our Australian Best Practices, &lsquo;there will always 
be debate about what is &ldquo;best&rdquo;&rsquo;.1 In the UK, for example, clinical legal 
education practices are described as &lsquo;standards&rsquo;, though they do not serve 
a regulatory function. For comparison&rsquo;s sake, this chapter will refer to the 
UK &lsquo;standards&rsquo; as &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; or &lsquo;best practices standards&rsquo;.

</p>
<p>While each country has a different system of legal education, and a 
different process for determining how a person qualifies for admission to 
practise law, the core pedagogy of clinical legal education in each country 
emphasises involving students in the work that lawyers perform in service 
to clients with legal problems. In a clinical course, &lsquo;clinic students confront 
the same types of issues they will confront after becoming full-fledged 
lawyers, [and] they do so under the supervision of faculty who engage 
the students in the process of critique, self-critique, and self-reflection&rsquo;.2 
This pedagogy focuses on assisting students not just to learn how to learn 
from their experiences, but also to appreciate how that knowledge will 
assist them in their development as effective, ethical lawyers or other 
professionals, as well as to reflect on the role of law and the legal system 
in achieving justice.
</p>
<p>In Australia, the UK and the US, clinical legal education principally 
developed as an emerging pedagogy in the 1960s and 1970s,3 though, 
especially in the US, the origins of clinical legal education are much 
earlier.4 In some jurisdictions, the focus of clinical legal education has 
been on client service and, in others, on legal education. However, both 
objectives are commonly recognised as important in all three countries. 
Other notable differences in clinical legal education among countries 
have included law reform versus client service in program goals, systemic 
advocacy versus individual advocacy in legal service delivery and, 
increasingly, the academic status of clinicians both within their individual 
law schools and the legal academies in their countries. 
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we compare the efforts in each country to establish best 
practices in clinical legal education, and the resulting best practices 
that were developed. We hope that the material in this chapter may aid 
clinicians in other countries as they consider whether to develop their 
own best practices in light of their cultures, legal institutions, and systems 
of legal education.

</p>
<p>Why best practices?
The development of best practices reflects a level of maturity in clinical 
legal education, and represents an effort to move from the implicit and 
often anecdotal understanding concerning teaching and organising 
clinical legal education to a more systematic and explicit articulation 
of its effective qualities. By identifying and explicitly communicating 
educational practices and organisation of clinical legal education, best 
practices identify achievable goals and practices for individual clinicians, 
their clinical programs, and clinical legal education within each country. 
The articulation of best practices also supports the development of clinical 
legal education more broadly and documents existing good practices.
</p>
<p>Best practices provide clinicians, law school deans, and other academic 
staff with criteria or guidelines for strengthening their clinical programs. 
Not only do best practices serve to enhance existing clinical programs, 
but they are also an important resource for law schools initiating such 
programs. In addition, for countries that have law school accreditation 
standards, such as the US,5 best practices for clinical legal education can 
be influential. For example, efforts to identify best practices for clinical 
education in the US, especially in the areas of externships and status of 
clinical faculty, have had a beneficial effect on accreditation standards.6
</p>
<p>Before best practices for clinical legal education can be developed in 
any country, there first needs to be a perceived need or benefit. In the 
US, where legal educators developed the first set of best practices (called 
&lsquo;guidelines for clinical legal education&rsquo;) in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
the need was originally motivated by the growing importance of clinical 
legal education in legal education.7 By the early 1990s, clinical faculty 
compiled data on reported practices of in-house clinics in areas such as 
student&ndash;faculty ratios, hiring criteria for clinicians, and structures for 
in-house clinics.8 The more recent version of best practices for clinical legal

<p>education in the US is the result of an effort that addresses best practices 
for all of legal education, and was motivated by the principle that US law 
schools could and should better prepare students for the practice of law. 
In the UK, which developed best practices first in 1995 and then revised 
them in 2007, the need was to provide guidance to those active in clinical 
legal education as well as to those setting up new clinical programs.9 In 
Australia, the development of best practices responded to the need to 
integrate clinical legal education better into the academic focus of law 
schools, as well as to promote better unity between the academic and 
clinical dimensions of legal education.10
</p>
<p>Comparing the scope of clinical best 
practices in Australia, the United Kingdom 
and the United States
The scope of best practices, and the nomenclature, differs in each country, 
in part due to the underlying need or motivation for identifying best 
practices. Our 2013 Best Practices: Australian Clinical Legal Education 
addresses clinical legal education through in-house live client clinics, 
external live client clinics (&lsquo;agency clinics&rsquo;), externships and clinical 
components of doctrinal law courses.11 The 2007 UK Model Standards for 
Live-Client Clinics addresses live client clinical legal education that occurs 
in-house or through an external agency.12 The 2007 version partially relied 
upon work published in 2004 by Richard Grimes and Hugh Brayne 
identifying and mapping best practices in clinical legal education through 
a project funded by the UK Centre for Legal Education.13 The 2007 
US Best Practices for Legal Education addresses all of legal education,14

<p>devoting a chapter to &lsquo;Best Practices for Experiential Courses&rsquo;,15 which 
include simulation courses, in-house live client clinics and externships, 
and another separate chapter to &lsquo;Best Practices for Assessing Student 
Learning&rsquo;.16 In our chapter, the comparisons of standards or best practices 
in each country will focus primarily on live client clinical legal education, 
in both in-house and external clinics or externships, because the live client 
element is the common denominator in those three models of clinical 
legal education. 
</p>
<p>An additional consideration for comparison&rsquo;s sake is the fact that in the US 
there are formal accreditation standards for law schools promulgated by the 
American Bar Association (ABA).17 One standard and its interpretations 
address requirements for externships,18 another standard defines a &lsquo;law 
clinic&rsquo;,19 and another standard and its interpretations require that the terms 
and conditions of employment for full-time clinical faculty members be 
reasonably similar to those for other full-time academic faculty.20 Because 
the ABA standards address conditions of employment for clinical faculty, 
the best practices in the US do not. The best practices in the US also do 
not include all of the requirements for externships found in the ABA 
standards, though they do cover many, and include some best practices for 
externships not in the ABA Standards.

<p>In Australia, the Council of Australian Law Deans (CALD) has adopted 
voluntary standards addressing matters related to the operation of law 
schools and law courses.21 In Chapter 2, we provided an explanation of the 
regulation of law schools and the roles played by CALD and governmental 
regulatory bodies in Australia.
</p>
<p>In contrast to the US, there is no overarching regulatory body for law 
schools in the UK, nor is there voluntary regulation similar to the CALD 
standards in Australia. As a result, one of the authors of the 2007 UK 
Model Standards for Live-Client Clinics refers to the document as largely 
consensual and &lsquo;a description of a range of good practices rather than 
necessarily best practices&rsquo;.22 
</p>
<p>Process
Clinical researchers in each country employed different processes to 
study and obtain input to the development of best practices. While the 
processes differed, in each country the processes included efforts to solicit 
contributions from as many clinicians as possible so that the resulting 
best practices would serve the function of addressing important aspects 
of clinical legal education, utilising the lessons learned from clinicians 
with broad-ranging experiences. In each country, broad input was key 
to developing best practices that would reflect areas of consensus, as well 
as identify guidelines and practices for important issues facing clinicians 
where consensus had not yet formed. In Australia and the US, other legal 
educators not teaching clinical legal education provided additional input 
and perspectives.
</p>
<p>The process of developing best practices in each country also involved 
research into the theoretical and practical dimensions of clinical legal 
education. The research component was very important in order for best 
practices to reflect something more than existing practices, especially 
where existing practices varied among clinicians and law schools. As a

</p>
<p>result, the best practices in each country also represent aspirational goals 
for clinicians, their law schools, and for clinical legal education in their 
countries. The balance of this section outlines the processes.
</p>
<p>Australia
The development of best practices for clinical legal education in Australia 
has been distinct from the development of best practices in the UK and 
the US. The Office for Learning and Teaching (previously known as 
the Australian Learning and Teaching Council) funded this effort after 
a competitive grant process that required the project team to identify 
the project&rsquo;s rationale, methodology, and outcomes.23 The grant process 
therefore required the project team to approach the development of 
best practices in a well-thought-out and systematic way. The grant also 
required periodic reports and a timetable for achieving various aspects 
of the project that served to keep the project focused and adhering to a 
schedule. The grant support provided funds for staff support and expenses 
related to the project.
</p>
<p>The project team consisted of representatives from six law schools closely 
associated with experiential learning in law.24 In addition to the project 
team there was both a national reference group and an international 
reference group that provided input throughout all phases of the project.25 
The project team investigated current practices in clinical programs 
throughout all of Australia and held workshops across Australia in order 
</p>
<p>23  After the grant award, the Australian Learning and Teaching Council was renamed the Office for 
Learning and Teaching, and information about the Office for Learning and Teaching is available on 
its website www.olt.gov.au/. Accessed 23 September 2014.

Professor Anna Cody, Director of Kingsford Legal Centre, University of New South Wales; Anna 
Copeland, Director of Clinical Legal Education Programs, Murdoch University; Professor Jeff 
Giddings, Director of Professionalism, Griffith University; Professor Mary Anne Noone, Coordinator, 
Clinical Legal Education and Public Interest Law Postgraduate Programs, La Trobe University; and 
Professor Simon Rice, ANU College of Law, The Australian National University.

and Law, University of Northumbria, UK; Professor Philip Plowden, Pro Vice-Chancellor, University

</p>
<p>to understand the different approaches to clinical legal education and to 
identify effective practices. The project was a broad-based team effort that 
lasted 27 months.
</p>
<p>The project team&rsquo;s methodology began with developing a single research 
instrument to survey Australian clinicians. Project team members 
interviewed clinicians and interested legal academics concerning the survey 
instrument, and utilised their input to refine the survey instrument. The 
project team next created a database of clinicians in Australia. Preliminary 
colloquia were held in some of the regions to introduce the survey 
instrument.
</p>
<p>Once the survey instrument was finalised, the project team conducted 
interviews with clinicians and local stakeholders, principally in person 
but occasionally via telephone and webcam. Altogether, the project team 
interviewed representatives of 26 law schools over a 12-month period. 
The survey sought information on &lsquo;what are existing practices&rsquo; and &lsquo;what 
should be best practices&rsquo; for clinical legal education in Australia.
</p>
<p>Using the responses from these surveys, as well as drafts of regional reports 
from participants at colloquia throughout Australia, the project team 
produced five Regional Reports identifying current practices in clinical 
legal education in 2011: one each for New South Wales and the Australian 
Capital Territory; Queensland and Northern New South Wales; South 
Australia; Western Australia and the Northern Territory; and Victoria 
and Tasmania.26 Regional colloquia introduced key contributors to the 
initial findings of the Regional Reports. Before finalising the reports, the 
project team received feedback and evaluation from both the national and 
international reference groups. 
</p>
<p>Initially, the project envisioned the development of &lsquo;standards&rsquo; for clinical 
legal education. The project team members utilised the information 
they gathered through the survey interviews and colloquia to develop an 
initial set of standards. These standards were circulated to an international 
audience at a joint conference of the Global Alliance for Justice Education 
(GAJE) and the International Journal of Clinical Legal Education in 
Valencia, Spain, in July 2011, and to a domestic audience at the 
Australian Clinical and Experiential Education Conference in September 
2011. The conference workshops generated helpful feedback. After the

<p>conference in Australia, the project team decided that characterising their 
recommendations as &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; (rather than &lsquo;standards&rsquo;) was likely to 
be more productive and would better serve their acceptance by clinicians, 
law faculty, law deans, and others. Some thought &lsquo;standards&rsquo; suggested a 
prescriptive approach. 
</p>
<p>The project team used material from the international and domestic 
conferences, as well as the reference groups, to develop best practices 
around the following seven themes: course design; law in context in a 
clinical setting; supervision; reflective student learning; assessment; staff; 
and infrastructure. Additional drafts of the best practices organised around 
these seven themes were presented to a stakeholder project workshop in 
December 2011, to CALD in July 2012, and to the Australasian Law 
Teachers Association (ALTA) Conference in July 2012. 
</p>
<p>The project team finalised the best practices in a document entitled Best 
Practices: Australian Clinical Legal Education, in September 2012, and 
presented the final version to CALD. CALD resolved unanimously to 
endorse the final version of the clinical best practices in November 2012.
</p>
<p>United Kingdom
In the UK, the Clinical Legal Education Organisation (CLEO) developed 
an initial set of standards for live client clinics in 1995 at a time when 
some law schools were considering implementing clinical courses. 
Although CLEO refers to &lsquo;standards&rsquo; rather than best practices, as noted 
at the start of this chapter, we will use the term &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; or &lsquo;best 
practices standards&rsquo; because they function as such.
</p>
<p>CLEO&rsquo;s best practices standards resulted from the work of experienced 
clinicians who had identified good practices in developing clinical legal 
education in the UK. CLEO then adopted the best practices standards at 
its 1995 Plymouth Conference in the UK.27
</p>
<p>Although active in the 1990s, CLEO then became dormant for a period 
of time.28 However, it was revitalised and in 2006 it undertook to review 
and update its best practices to reflect developments due to the expansion

</p>
<p>of clinical legal education in the UK. The process involved discussion 
of revisions at CLEO meetings and the circulation of multiple drafts to 
CLEO members and others interested in clinical legal education. 
</p>
<p>Eventually, a general consensus was reached and CLEO adopted the Model 
Standards for Live-Client Clinics in 2007. These revised best practices 
standards state that they &lsquo;are intended to provide a benchmark for those 
active in or setting up clinics, and reflect the wide experience of those 
already running clinics both in the UK and abroad&rsquo;.29

In August 2001, the US Clinical Legal Education Association (CLEA) 
Board of Directors initiated the Best Practices Project. This followed a 
much earlier effort of a committee of the Association of American Law 
Schools (AALS) and the ABA that developed guidelines for clinical legal 
education published in 1980,30 as well as another effort of an ABA taskforce 
that resulted in a report commonly known as the MacCrate Report,31 
which emphasised the important contribution of clinical legal education 
in teaching lawyering skills and professional values in law schools. 
</p>
<p>The CLEA Board appointed Professor Roy Stuckey to chair the project 
and created a steering committee consisting of 14 members representing 
a&nbsp;cross-section of clinical teachers and some interested non-clinical faculty. 
The steering committee determined the scope of their work.32 Early in the 
project, the steering committee decided that the overall aim should be to 
focus on how law schools could and should better prepare students for the 
practice of law. 
</p>
<p>Better preparing students for the practice of law is extremely important in 
the US, because US law schools are professional schools, and graduation 
from an ABA-accredited law school enables graduates to sit for the bar 
in every US jurisdiction. As a result, almost all law school graduates 
take the bar examination and seek to be admitted to the practice of law.

</p>
<p>Because the primary mission of every US law school is to prepare students 
for the practice of law and entrance into the legal profession, Professor 
Stuckey and the steering committee determined that focusing solely on 
best practices for clinical legal education would be insufficient to fulfil the 
overall project aim.
</p>
<p>Professor Stuckey was the principal author, and much of the best practices 
for clinical legal education reflect his research into best practices for all 
aspects of legal education. The process of formulating the best practices 
involved several meetings of the steering committee and other faculty 
interested in the project throughout the different parts of the US in 
which drafts of the best practices were presented. Each new draft of the 
best practices was posted on a website, usually three times a year, and 
notices of the new drafts were distributed through various clinical and 
other law faculty listserves. This process spanned nearly six years. Literally 
hundreds of clinicians, legal educators and others provided suggestions 
and assisted with drafting what was eventually published as Best Practices 
for Legal Education: A Vision and a Road Map.33 As the book containing 
the best practices was being finalised in 2007, CLEA appointed a Best 
Practices Implementation Committee to publicise the best practices and 
to encourage law schools to adopt them. 
</p>
<p>The chapter devoted to best practices for experiential courses relied on 
scholarship and teaching materials from more than 40 clinicians, as 
well as on the work of educational theorists and the results of surveys 
and clinical committee reports.34 The chapter also drew on the work of 
a&nbsp; joint committee of the AALS and the ABA that published Guidelines 
for&nbsp;Clinical Legal Education in 1980.35
</p>
<p>Reinforcing the work on best practices in the US was the publication 
in 2007 of a study by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teaching that called for the &lsquo;integration of student learning of theoretical 
and practical legal knowledge and professional identity&rsquo;.36 The Carnegie 
Report observed: &lsquo;Clinics can be a key setting for integrating all the

<p>elements of legal education, as students draw on and develop their 
doctrinal reasoning, lawyering skills, and ethical engagement, extending to 
contextual issues such as the policy environment.&rsquo;37 The Carnegie Report&rsquo;s 
ultimate conclusion was that clinical legal education can and should play 
a key role in preparing students for the practice of law.38
</p>
<p>Best Practices for Legal Education and the Carnegie Report have helped to 
shape thinking in the US about the development of legal education and 
the importance of clinical legal education. Since their publication, there 
has been an increased emphasis on clinical legal education at many law 
schools.39 
</p>
<p>Conclusion
Each country employed a different process for identifying best practices, 
although the goals in each country were largely the same&mdash;to identify 
existing practices that are generally accepted as preferable ways of organising 
and delivering clinical legal education. In Australia, the process was very 
structured and systematic, soliciting input not just from clinicians in 
Australia but from other legal educators in Australia and in other countries. 
The process for identifying best practices in the US was not as systematic 
as that in Australia, but was structured to provide an opportunity for as 
much input as possible from clinicians and other interested educators. 
It&nbsp;was also very research-based, drawing on scholarship and research into 
teaching and learning, empirical studies about negative effects of current 
legal educational practices on the emotional wellbeing of students, and 
was informed by the work of the Law Society of England and Wales in 
developing a new training framework for solicitors.40 In contrast to both the 
processes in Australia and the US, the best practices standards developed 
in the UK were less informed by research into teaching and learning but, 
rather, reflected a consensus among UK clinicians concerning the best 
approaches for developing clinical legal education.

<p>General scope of best practices: 
Live client clinics
The best practices developed in all three countries share a focus on 
best practices for live client clinics&mdash;that is, clinics in which students 
represent, or assist in the representation of, real clients with legal 
problems. The&nbsp;reason for this shared focus is not explained, though it may 
be because those involved in developing the best practices in each country 
had experience primarily in this form of clinical legal education. While 
the best practices share a particular focus on live client clinics, the general 
scope of each set of best practices varies from all of legal education in the 
US, to all of clinical legal education in Australia, to focusing solely on live 
client clinics&nbsp;in the UK. 
</p>
<p>The organisation of the best practices also differs. Australian best 
practices&nbsp;are organised around seven themes, with a short discussion of 
each theme followed by underlying principles and then best practices with 
illustrations. There is also a bibliography of books and articles for each 
theme. The&nbsp; UK best practices are organised around 24 standards with 
subsections, without a bibliography or references. The UK best practices 
standards do not prescribe learning outcomes or take a position on student 
assessment, but do provide appendices with an example of learning 
outcomes and the &lsquo;pros and cons&rsquo; of assessing student performance. 
The&nbsp;US best practices identify a set of 10 best practices for all experiential 
courses (simulations, externships, and live client), eight best practices 
specific to in-house clinical courses, and 11 best practices for externships, 
as well as the underlying principles for the best practices.
</p>
<p>The following table provides an overview of the general focus of each 
set of best practices relating primarily to live client clinics, whether in-
house, external or externships. Where distinctions between best practices 
for in-house clinics and external clinics or externships are important, 
those distinctions are noted. The main themes are identified using the 
best practices headings in each country, though some paraphrasing is used 
when necessary. 
</p>
<p>To assist interpretation, the table uses the assigned numbering systems used 
in Australia and the UK, and lists the most equivalent US best practices, 
which rely on letters and numbers. In the US, those best practices for all 
experiential courses are labelled A.2.a&ndash;j; best practices for in-house live 
client clinics are labelled C.2.a&ndash;h; and best practices for externships are 
labelled D.2.a&ndash;k.</p>

<p>Observations from comparing best practices 
The comparison of best practices for clinical legal education in Australia, 
the UK and the US demonstrates points of unity and divergence that 
reflect, in part, the differing motivations to create best practices in each 
country. All three sets of best practices address issues of importance to 
designing and delivering effective clinical legal education. All three 
explicitly reflect a commitment to educating students to become effective, 
ethical practitioners. In addition, each set of best practices involves differing 
levels of input from clinicians not directly involved in the drafting, and 
therefore reflects different approaches to addressing the issues identified.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AUSTRALiAn CLiniCAL LegAL edUCATion
</p>
<p>238
</p>
<p>The best practices standards in the UK are explicitly characterised as 
setting forth &lsquo;a minimum requirement, and one that might be exceeded 
where resourcing and pedagogic aims permit&rsquo;.41 Given the underlying 
motivation to provide guidance to new clinical programs as well as to 
reflect extant good practices, the best practices standards take a very nuts 
and bolts approach to what is minimally necessary to structure live client 
clinical legal education, focusing solely on live client clinics.
</p>
<p>In contrast to the UK best practices standards, the best practices in 
Australia are explicitly characterised as reflecting &lsquo;what should be&rsquo; best 
practices based both on empirical research into existing practices and 
engagement with relevant literature.42 While some of the best practices 
reflect basic requirements for clinical legal education, many of the best 
practices go much further and are aspirational in terms of defining the 
elements of effective, excellent clinical legal education. The best practices 
in Australia look at wholly law school&ndash;funded in-house live client clinics, 
in-house live client clinics with some external funding, external live client 
clinics (&lsquo;agency clinics&rsquo;), externships, and clinical components, such as 
simulations of legal practice activities, in other courses.
</p>
<p>In contrast to the best practices in both Australia and the UK, the US 
best practices that focus on clinical legal education are part of the larger 
project to define best practices for legal education as a whole. Like the 
best practices in Australia, the US best practices address all forms of live 
client clinics, externships, and simulation courses or course components. 
In addition, the US best practices also look at all other aspects of the 
law school curriculum and include non-clinical legal education courses. 
Given the broader scope of the US project, many of the best practices for 
clinical legal education are not as detailed or specific as those in Australia, 
and they do not focus on as many aspects of clinical legal education as the 
best practices in either Australia or the UK. The resulting document is 
large and reflects &lsquo;a thoughtful and deliberate search for ways to improve 
legal education that are consistent with sound educational theories and

Each set of best practices serves as an important resource for clinicians in 
each of the countries where they were created. The best practices reflect 
a common understanding in each country about the practices that best 
develop and deliver effective clinical legal education. Clinicians should 
compare their own practices with the best practices. Then they should 
decide whether and how to use their country&rsquo;s best practices to improve 
their clinical course, discuss with colleagues changes to the clinical 
program, and discuss with members of their law school&rsquo;s administration 
changes that may require institutional support.
</p>
<p>Despite the different aims or purposes for best practices for clinical legal 
education in Australia, the UK and the US, the best practices from these 
three countries have many points of agreement on what is important to 
delivering effective clinical legal education. These points of agreement 
represent a shared understanding of important aspects of clinical legal 
education that transcends the system of legal education in each country. 
In this regard, the best practices from these three countries may serve as 
useful resources for clinicians in other countries as they structure their own 
clinical programs. In particular, the UK best practices standards address 
issues important to creating new live client clinics, and the Australian best 
practices address in some detail course design, law in context in a clinical 
setting, supervision, reflective student learning, assessment, staff and 
infrastructure for different forms of live client clinics, externships, and 
clinical components in other courses. In contrast, the US best practices 
primarily address issues of the curriculum in general, and are important 
for clinicians in countries in which law schools are primarily focused on 
preparing students for the practice of law because nearly all law school 
graduates are admitted to practise law. The US best practices also serve as 
a useful resource for clinicians in any country interested in structuring law 
school curricula to prepare students better for the practice of law.

<p>In other chapters in this book, we have addressed in depth many of 
the issues identified in the best practices from these three countries, 
including course design, supervision, reflective practice, law in context 
and assessment. In additional chapters, we have examined related issues 
such as costs and resources, non-traditional clients, and other issues of 
justice in clinics. These chapters are very important to understanding both 
the practical and theoretical underpinnings of creating best practices for 
clinical legal education. </p>

Conclusion
</p>
<p>Clinical legal education in Australia is dynamic. There are frequent 
new developments, regular improvements, changes in partnerships and, 
sometimes, curtailment of programs. As we discussed in Chapter&nbsp; 2, 
Australian clinical legal education is making multiple contributions to 
the study of law and the education of future legal practitioners. This 
book provides a critical foundation for future growth. It makes the case 
for empowering Australian legal education with the best clinical legal 
education practices available to contemporary law schools. It seeks to 
deepen the understanding of clinical pedagogy. 
</p>
<p>In the preceding chapters, we have not only provided a comprehensive 
and&nbsp; detailed account of the critical aspects of Best Practices: Australian 
Clinical Legal Education, but we have also expanded and illuminated 
these aspects. Chapter 2 clearly sets out the various factors affecting legal 
education (and consequently clinical legal education). For those new to 
clinical legal education and those wishing to review their own programs, 
Chapters 3 to 9 highlight the central role of social justice in Australian 
clinics, set out the merits of various models of clinical legal education, 
clarify the benefits of good course design and the role of assessment, detail 
critical aspects of effective supervision and discuss processes to foster 
reflective practice, and address infrastructure requirements. Chapter 10 
concludes with an international perspective on approaches to best practice 
in clinical legal&nbsp;education. </p>

<p>In this final chapter, we provide illustrations of the links between some 
recent developments in Australian clinical legal education and emerging 
trends in legal education, legal practice and provision of legal aid services. 
The surveys of Australian clinical programs conducted as part of the 
Australian Learning and Teaching Council Priority Project, referred to 
regularly throughout this book, were completed in 2010&ndash;11.1 At the time, 
the number of clinical legal education subjects/programs was increasing 
and different formats were developing. We have referred to examples of 
recent developments in the preceding chapters; however, the instances 
discussed in this concluding chapter are highlighted as they reinforce 
the potential and the challenges of advancing best practice in Australian 
clinical legal education.
</p>
<p>As we discussed in Chapter 1, there is growing concern in Australia 
(and elsewhere) about the numbers of students currently studying law.2 
This increasing number presents both an opportunity and a challenge 
for clinical legal education. It is reported that students graduating with 
some form of undergraduate or postgraduate law qualification increased 
from 6,149 in 2001 to 12,742 in 2012.3 The Bachelor of Laws (LLB) or 
Juris Doctor (JD) are the Australian academic qualifications that enable 
law graduates to become lawyers. The LLB is increasingly being seen as 
an undergraduate generalist degree and LLB graduates are employed in 
a&nbsp;wide variety of industries and occupations, not only legal,4 whereas the 
JD&nbsp;is a postgraduate professionally oriented qualification.

<p>Growth in Juris Doctor degrees
The growth of the JD qualification in Australia has begun to positively 
influence the development of clinical legal education. This postgraduate 
professional degree is common in the United States but only in the last 
decade has the JD become a feature of law school offerings in Australia.5 
In 2014, 13 (out of 36)6 Australian law schools offered this degree.7 Most 
of these law schools continue to offer an LLB, but three universities 
offered law studies only at the postgraduate level.8 The number of students 
completing JD courses increased 330 per cent from 1,635 in 2001 to 
7,036 in&nbsp;2012.9
</p>
<p>Relevantly for those interested in clinical legal education, according to 
the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), the JD is categorised as 
level 9, Masters Degree (Extended).10 The AQF descriptor for the Masters 
Degree (Extended) is: 
</p>
<p>The [qualification] is designed so that graduates will have undertaken 
a&nbsp; program of structured learning with some independent research and 
a significant proportion of practice related learning. As this qualification is 
designed to prepare graduates to engage in a profession the practice related 
learning must be developed in collaboration with a relevant professional, 
statutory or regulatory body [emphasis added].11

Centre. A new law school at Swinburne University in Victoria opened in 2015 with a commitment 
to providing 20 days external placement to each student per year.

</p>
<p>As Cooper and others comment, &lsquo;the requirement that a JD include 
&ldquo;a&nbsp; significant proportion of practice-related learning&rdquo; may potentially 
have resource and logistical implications for law schools&rsquo;.12 Obviously, 
having a range of clinical legal education subjects within the JD enables 
a law school to fulfil this requirement of the AQF. However, Cooper 
and others argue that &lsquo;practice-related learning&rsquo; could be interpreted to 
include a range of experiential type learning opportunities, for instance: 
&lsquo;problem-based learning, mooting and role-play activities related to 
legal interviewing, negotiation and mediation&rsquo;.13 Recent developments 
suggest law schools see the added benefit of including some clinical legal 
education experience within the JD. Universities with established clinical 
legal education programs have expanded their offerings to include specific 
subjects for JD students.14
</p>
<p>The most explicit illustration of the impact of the AQF (and United States&rsquo; 
influence) are developments at the University of Melbourne Law School. 
Despite its being one of the leading law schools in the country, there has, 
until recently, been no clinical legal education program at the University 
of Melbourne.15 However, since 2012, the law school has launched the 
Public Interest Law Initiative, which enables &lsquo;students to contribute to 
the work of our community law partners and learn by working with real 
clients to solve real legal problems&rsquo;.16 Currently Melbourne Law School 
offers its JD students clinical experiences in its Public Interest Law&nbsp;Clinic, 
an externship program where students work at Victoria Legal Aid or a 
community legal centre, a Street Law subject and a Sustainability Business 
Clinic based at Melbourne Law School supervised by lawyers from large 
commercial law firms. In 2015, a new subject, the Disability Human 
Rights Clinic, was offered. It has a multidisciplinary focus that brings 
together the fields of disability studies and international human rights 
law.17

</p>
<p>Although these subjects are electives, these developments at Melbourne 
University suggest that the adoption of the JD within law schools can have 
a positive impact on the expansion of clinical legal education. This could 
be the result of a range of factors, including the impact of the AQF and 
the professional practice focus of the degree, student demand, additional 
revenue generated by the high fees charged for the JD or the need to be 
seen to be a &lsquo;global&rsquo; (United States&ndash;style) university. It is also noteworthy 
that this high-status law school has continued the Australian clinical legal 
education focus of developing programs that aim to improve access to 
justice and provide services to disadvantaged clients.18 
</p>
<p>Globalisation of legal practice and 
legal education 
Globalisation has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on 
legal practice19 and legal education.20 Law schools are responding to 
the requirement to educate future lawyers to work in this globalised 
environment.21 One of the reasons for the adoption of the JD is the 
globalisation of legal practice. In a 2012 research project, Bentley and 
Squelch developed a framework for internationalising the Australian law 
curriculum. The purpose of this framework was &lsquo;to better equip graduates 
to work in a global, international context and across multiple jurisdictions; 
and to enable graduates to contribute in an international setting to the 
articulation, nurturing and transmission of values&rsquo;.22 The conclusions of 
that project included the need for law schools wishing to internationalise 
their law curriculum to develop a multifaceted approach and to focus 
on the knowledge, skills and attributes identified as essential for a global

<p>multijurisdictional environment.23 It is not yet clear whether the values 
mentioned by Bentley and Squelch will include the historic Australian 
clinical focus on improving access to justice, but Australian law schools 
are well placed to influence this issue.
</p>
<p>An example of how the pedagogy of clinical legal education can facilitate 
multiple learning outcomes, is the development of cross-jurisdictional 
clinics. In the International Social Justice Clinic at The Australian 
National University (ANU), law students engage in non-government 
organisational activity in developing countries. Students work in teams 
to carry out human rights policy research for a partner non-government 
organisation (NGO), under supervision by staff both at ANU and at the 
NGO. Students are supervised regularly by NGO staff through online 
communications technology.24 Similar clinics have been run at other 
universities.25 
</p>
<p>Another aspect of the internationalisation of legal practice has been the 
increasingly important role played by clinical legal education in legal 
education worldwide. The extent of this global reach is illustrated in the 
many examples detailed in Bloch&rsquo;s The Global Clinical Movement.26 Many 
Australian clinicians are part of a global network and are members of 
the Global Alliance for Justice Education (GAJE). Membership of GAJE 
consists of not only law teachers but also law students, judges, lawyers 
and others interested in advancing and promoting justice education 
around the world.27 One of the consequences of GAJE membership is 
collaboration in the development of international clinics. For example, 
clinical staff at a number of Australian universities have worked with 
Bridges Across Borders Southeast Asia Community Legal Education 
Initiative (BABSEA CLE). BABSEA CLE&rsquo;s aim is to help establish, 
strengthen and support university-based and community-based clinical 
legal education programs and it works collaboratively with universities, 
law students, law faculties, lawyers, members of the legal community,

<p>23  There have been a number of innovations as a consequence of the internationalisation of legal 
education. See Ben Saul and Irene Baghoomians, &lsquo;An experiential international law field school in

<p>and justice-related organisational partners throughout Southeast Asia.28 
Australian law schools have run &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; clinics with BABSEA, hosted 
international law academics in Australian clinical legal education 
programs29 and Australian clinical staff have participated and run courses 
in Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar.30 It is likely that, with an increasing 
focus on producing graduates who are global citizens, universities will 
encourage their law schools to pursue these types of collaborations. 
</p>
<p>Changes in legal service provision 
to the disadvantaged 
As we have detailed in several chapters of this book, most Australian clinical 
legal education programs are based in, or rely on externship placements 
in, community legal centres or legal aid organisations. Our survey found 
that the current features of Australian clinical legal education are a 
strong focus on service to the community; of law-in-context discussions; 
involvement in a range of legal activities including individual case work, 
law reform, legal research and community legal education; location in 
not-for-profits, community legal centres and legal aid organisations; and 
growth in externships.31 
</p>
<p>Consequently, any changes and developments in the legal assistance 
sector will affect clinical programs. For instance, the federal government 
response to the recommendations of the 2014 report of the Productivity 
Commission into Access to Justice Arrangements32 and subsequent 
alterations to the infrastructure of legal assistance services across Australia 
will have significant repercussions for current clinical legal education 
programs. Reduction in funding to community legal centres or legal aid 
commissions threatens the viability of clinical programs and may lead to 
pressure on some programs. The strong focus on access to justice and social

<p>justice (discussed in Chapter 5) may also be challenged by changes to the 
priorities for how funding is to be allocated, the limitations placed on the 
scope of work and prohibitions on legal policy and law reform&nbsp;work.33  
</p>
<p>Impact of funding crisis: Victoria Legal Aid example
Since 1994, La Trobe University&rsquo;s law school had worked in partnership 
with Victoria Legal Aid (VLA) in an &lsquo;external live client&rsquo; clinic providing 
additional legal services to VLA clients. The educational focus of this clinic 
was legal ethics and completion of the subject satisfied the professional 
requirement of Ethics and Professional Responsibility.34 In 2013, the 
program underwent modification as a consequence of changes at VLA. 
</p>
<p>The changes at VLA during 2013 were a response to a significant budget 
shortfall, caused by increased demand for legal aid services. This led to 
a dramatic reduction in legal aid services to the Victorian community. 
VLA curtailed services in a variety of ways; for example, limitations on 
types of legal matters and aspects of legal work eligible for assistance; and 
internal staff reductions.35 The budgetary response included the closure 
of a metropolitan regional office (Preston).36 The rationale given for the 
closure was the financial situation, changed demographics of the area 
(reduced need) and closure of a local court. The Preston VLA office closed 
on 28 June 2013.37 
</p>
<p>Partly as a consequence of the closure of this office, La Trobe University&rsquo;s 
unique clinical legal education program, based at this VLA regional office 
and focused on teaching legal ethics, ceased.38 However, it was not only 
the physical closure of the office that affected the clinical program; changes 
</p>
<p>33  Community legal centres claim the current National Partnership Agreement (NPA) contains 
a 30 per cent funding cut in 2017. Additionally the NPA restricts legal aid organisations using 
Commonwealth funds for lobbying or public campaigns. This is a specific concern for community 
legal centres as systemic advocacy and law reform work has been an integral aspect of their work since 
they began. See&nbsp;Federation of Community Legal Centres, The Facts about Federal&nbsp;Cuts &ndash; Community

</p>
<p>to the VLA guidelines, the decision that the organisation would no longer 
conduct &lsquo;minor work&rsquo; files and the increased pressure on availability of 
physical office space all contributed to the cessation of the program. 
The&nbsp;combination of these issues also put paid to any relocation of this 
clinical program to another section of VLA.39
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the ethics-based clinical subject continues. The coherence of 
the course design and the adaptability and resourcefulness of the clinical 
staff involved meant that the program could be transposed to another 
location. This experience highlights the need for vigilance and awareness of 
features that ensure sustainability of clinical programs. Giddings provides 
a comprehensive account of factors impacting clinics&rsquo; sustainability,40 as 
summarised in Chapter 2 of this book. The development of resilience 
and a capacity to adapt to changing external factors is a crucial part of 
best practice. Clarity of the purpose and aims of a clinical program, 
as discussed in Chapter 4, can assist in sustainability. Importantly, the 
creativity, resilience and commitment of clinical staff (as discussed in 
Chapter 9) should never be underestimated. 
</p>
<p>New models: Multidisciplinary clinics
One area of innovation within the legal assistance sector offers exciting 
potential growth for clinical programs and enhancement of clinical 
pedagogy. Given the proven connection between clients&rsquo; legal problems 
and health issues, there is increased activity in the delivery of integrated 
legal services within a health care setting.41 Additionally, the Law and 
Justice Foundation (NSW) research shows that legal professionals are 
consulted only in relation to 16 per cent of all legal problems, whereas 
people often turn to their trusted health and welfare professionals for 
advice and assistance with issues that have legal aspects.42

<p>This health care delivery model integrates legal assistance as an important 
element of the health care team. In the United States this approach is 
described as Medical Legal Partnerships and in Australia they are referred to 
as Advocacy-Health Alliances or Health Justice Partnerships.43 The&nbsp;model 
is built on an understanding that the social, economic, and political 
contexts of an individual&rsquo;s circumstances impact upon their health, and 
that these social determinants of health often manifest in the form of 
legal needs or requirements. Research in the United States increasingly 
indicates positive benefits from an integrated service approach.44 
</p>
<p>There are a number of longstanding examples of the provision of legal 
services in a health setting in Australia.45 Recently, there has been a 
resurgence of interest in this delivery model and a number of innovations 
based in large public hospitals and community health organisations have 
emerged. Funders such as the Legal Services Board Victoria are actively 
supporting this approach46 and this growth of health justice partnerships 
presents new opportunities for clinical legal education to work with 
other medical, allied health and welfare disciplines in developing 
multidisciplinary clinics. In the United States, 46 law schools have clinics 
working in medical-legal partnerships.47 
</p>
<p>Although not an example of a Health Justice Partnership, a related recent 
innovation in the provision of multidisciplinary clinical legal practice 
in Australia is the Monash University multidisciplinary clinic. In this 
clinic, law, social work and finance students work together to provide 
services to clients. This approach also entails joint supervision from the 
three disciplines. The clinic provides a model of legal practice for future 
lawyers as well as a model for future clinical legal education innovations. 
The&nbsp;opportunity for legal clinicians to learn from working with supervisors 
from other disciplines enhances the quality of clinical legal education.

<p>Australian clinical legal education is an evolving and exciting field where 
new, evidence-based initiatives are proliferating. Australian clinical 
teachers and their supporters continue to be innovative, adaptable, 
resilient, rigorous and scholarly. As the legal landscape alters, so will legal 
education. Clinical legal education in Australia is a powerful exemplar of 
good legal education and is responding to both local and global challenges 
with many new ideas and approaches. Reference to the contents of this 
book will enhance and enable these developments to be the best possible.
