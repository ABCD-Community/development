<p>Preface
</p>
<p>The confluence of more powerful information technology, advances in method-
ology, and management&rsquo;s demand for an approach to marketing that is both
effective and accountable, has fueled explosive growth in the application of
database marketing.
</p>
<p>In order to position the field for future advances, we believe this is an
opportune time to take stock of what we know about database marketing
and identify where the knowledge gaps are. To do so, we have drawn on the
rich and voluminous repository of research on database marketing.
</p>
<p>Our emphasis on research &ndash; academic, practitioner, and joint research &ndash; is
driven by three factors. First, as we hope the book demonstrates, research has
produced a great deal of knowledge about database marketing, which until
now has not been collected and examined in one volume. Second, research is
fundamentally a search for truth, and to enable future advances in the field,
we think it is crucial to separate what is known from what is conjectured.
Third, the overlap between research and practice is particularly seamless in
this field. Database marketing is a meritocracy &ndash; if a researcher can find a
method that offers promise, a company can easily test it versus their current
practice, and adopt the new method if it proves itself better.
</p>
<p>We have thus attempted to produce a research-based synthesis of the
field &ndash; a unified and comprehensive treatment of what research has taught us
about the methods and tools of database marketing. Our goals are to enhance
research, teaching, and the practice of database marketing. Accordingly, this
book potentially serves several audiences:
</p>
<p>Researchers: Researchers should be able to use the book to assess what
is known about a particular topic, develop a list of research questions, and
draw on previous research along with newly developed methods to answer
these questions.
</p>
<p>Teachers: Teachers should find this book useful to educate themselves
about the field and decide what content they need to teach. We trust this
book will enable teachers to keep one step ahead of their students!

<p>viii Preface
</p>
<p>Ph.D. Students : Ph.D. students should utilize this book to gain the re-
quired background needed to conduct thesis research in the field of database
marketing.
</p>
<p>Advanced Business Students : By &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; business students, we mean
undergraduate and MBA students who need a resource book that goes into
depth about a particular topic. We have found in teaching database marketing
that it is very easy for the curious student to ask a question about topics
such as predictive modeling, cross-selling, collaborative filtering, or churn
management that takes them beyond the depth that can be covered in class.
This book is intended to provide that depth.
</p>
<p>Database Marketing Practitioners : This group encompasses those working
in, working with, and managing marketing analytics groups in companies
and consulting firms. An IT specialist needs to understand for what pur-
pose the data are to be used. A retention manager needs to know what is
&ldquo;out there&rdquo; in terms of methods for decreasing customer churn. A senior
manager may need insights on how to allocate funds to acquisition versus
retention of customers. A statistician may need to understand how to con-
struct a database marketing model that can be used to develop a customer-
personalized cross-selling effort. An analyst simply may need to understand
what neural networks, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines are.
We endeavor to provide answers to these and other relevant issues in this
book.
</p>
<p>While it is true that database marketing has experienced explosive growth
in the last decade, we have no doubt that the forces that produced this
growth &ndash; IT, methods and managerial imperatives &ndash; will continue. This book
is based on the premise that research can contribute to this growth, and as
a result, that database marketing&rsquo;s best days are ahead of it. We hope this
book provides a platform that can be used to realize this potential.
</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of database marketing is the interplay
between method and application. Our goal is to provide an in-depth treat-
ment of both of these elements of database marketing. Accordingly, there is a
natural sectioning of the book in terms of method and application. Parts II&ndash;
IV are mostly methodological chapters; Parts I, V, and IV cover application.
Specifically, we structure the book as follows:
</p>
<p>Part I: Strategic Issues &ndash; We define the scope of the field and the process
of conducting database marketing (Chapter 1). That process begins with a
database marketing strategy, which in turn leads to the question, what is
the purpose and role of database marketing (Chapter 2)? We discuss this
question in depth as well as two crucial factors that provide the backdrop for
successful DBM: organizational structure and customer privacy (Chapters 3
and 4).
</p>
<p>Part II: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) &ndash; Customer lifetime value is
one of the pillars, along with predictive modeling and testing, upon which
database marketing rests. We discuss methods for calculating LTV, including
providing detailed coverage of the &ldquo;thorny&rdquo; issues such as cost accounting</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Preface ix
</p>
<p>that are tempting to ignore, but whose resolution can have a crucial impact
on practice (Chapters 5&ndash;7).
</p>
<p>Part III: Database Marketing Tools: The Basics &ndash; DBM has one ab-
solute requirement &ndash; customer data. We discuss the sources and types of
customer data companies use (Chapter 8). We provide in-depth treatment
of two other pillars of database marketing &ndash; testing and predictive modeling
(Chapters 9&ndash;10).
</p>
<p>Part IV: Database Marketing Tools: Statistical Techniques &ndash; Here we dis-
cuss the several statistical methods, both traditional and cutting edge, that
are used to produce predictive models (Chapters 11&ndash;19). This is a valuable
section for anyone wanting to know, &ldquo;How is a decision tree produced,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;What are the detailed considerations in using logistic regression,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why
is a neural net potentially better than a decision tree,&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is machine
learning all about?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Part V: Customer Management &ndash; Here we focus our attention squarely on
application. We review the conceptual issues, what is known about them, and
the tools available to tackle customer management activities including acqui-
sition, cross- and up-selling, churn management, frequency reward programs,
customer tier programs, multichannel customer management, and acquisition
and retention spending (Chapters 20&ndash;26).
</p>
<p>Part VI: Managing the Marketing Mix &ndash; We concentrate on communica-
tions and pricing. We provide a thorough treatment of what we predict will be
the hallmark of the next generation of database marketing, namely &ldquo;optimal
contact models,&rdquo; where the emphasis is on taking into account &ndash; in quanti-
tative fashion &ndash; the future ramifications of current decisions, truly managing
the long-term value of a customer (Chapter 28). We also discuss the design of
DBM communications copy (Chapter 27) and several critical issues in pric-
ing, including acquisition versus retention pricing, and the coordination of
the two (Chapter 29).
</p>
<p>Our initial outline for this book took shape at the beginning of the mil-
lennium, in May 2000. The irony of taking 7 years to write a book about
techniques that often work in a matter of seconds does not escape us. In-
deed, writing this book has been a matter of trying to hit a moving target.
However, this effort has been the proverbial &ldquo;labor of love,&rdquo; and its length
and gestation period are products of the depth and scope we were aiming for.
This book is the outcome of the debates we have had on issues such as how to
treat fixed costs in calculating customer lifetime value, which methods merit
our attention and how exactly do they work, and why the multichannel cus-
tomer is a higher-value customer. Writing this book has truly been a process,
as is database marketing.
</p>
<p>Along the way, we have become indebted to numerous colleagues in both
academia and business without whom this book would be a shadow of its
current self. These people have provided working papers and references, ex-
changed e-mails with us, talked with us, and ultimately, taught us a great
deal about various aspects of database marketing. Included are: Kusum</p>

(data analysis), Qing-Lin Zhu and Paul Wolfson (simulation programming),
and Karen Sluzenski (library references), and for manuscript preparation
support tirelessly provided by Mary Biathrow, Deborah Gibbs, Patricia Hunt,
and Carol Millay.
</p>
<p>We benefited from two excellent reviews provided by Peter Verhoef and
Ed Malthouse, which supplied insights on both the forest and the trees that
significantly improved the final product.
</p>
<p>The Springer publishing team was tremendously supportive, helpful, and
extremely patient with our final assembly of the book. We owe our deep
gratitude to Deborah Doherty, Josh Eliashberg, Gillian Greenough, and Nick
Philipson.
</p>
<p>While people write and support the book, we also want to acknowledge
significant institutional support that provided us with funding, facilities, and
a stimulating environment in which to work. These include the Teradata
Center for CRM at Fuqua Business School, Duke University, which hosted
Scott Neslin during 2002, and our home institutions: the Kellogg School of
Management, Northwestern; Seoul National University; and the Tuck School

</p>
<p>Finally, we owe our profound and deepest gratitude simply to our spouses
and families, who provided the support, enduring patience, and companion-
ship without which this book would never have materialized. By showing us
that family is what really matters, they enabled us to survive the ups and
downs of putting together an effort of this magnitude. It is to our spouses
and families that we dedicate this book.

<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>Abstract Database marketing is &ldquo;the use of customer databases to enhance
marketing productivity through more effective acquisition, retention, and de-
velopment of customers.&rdquo; In this chapter we elaborate on this definition, pro-
vide an overview of why database marketing is becoming more important,
and propose a framework for the &ldquo;database marketing process.&rdquo; We conclude
with a discussion of how we organize the book.
</p>
<p>1.1 What Is Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>The purpose of marketing is to enable the firm to enhance customer value.
In today&rsquo;s competitive, information-intensive, ROI-oriented business environ-
ment, database marketing has emerged as an invaluable approach for achiev-
ing this purpose. The applications of database marketing are numerous and
growing exponentially. Here are a few examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Internet Portal, Inc.&rdquo; determines which of its customers will be most
receptive to targeted efforts to increase their usage of the portal. Perhaps
more importantly, it determines which customers will not be receptive to
these efforts.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;XYZ Bank&rdquo; decides which of its many financial products should be mar-
keted to which of its current customers.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;ABC Wireless&rdquo; develops the ability to predict which customers are most
likely to leave when their contract runs out, and designs a &ldquo;churn man-
agement program&rdquo; to encourage them to stay.
</p>
<p>&bull; UK Retailer Tesco develops thousands of customized promotion packages
it mails to its 14 million customers (Rohwedder 2006).
</p>
<p>&bull; Best Buy has identified the major segments of customers who visit its
stores. It then (1) tailors its store in a particular locality to fit the repre-
sentation of the segments in that locality, and (2) trains its store personnel
to recognize which segment a particular customer belongs to, so the cus-
tomer can be serviced appropriately (Boyle 2006).
</p>
<p>3</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>&bull; Catalogers routinely use &ldquo;predictive models&rdquo; to decide which customers
should receive which catalogs.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;E-tailer Z&rdquo; uses &ldquo;recommendation engines&rdquo; to customize which products
it &ldquo;cross-sells&rdquo; to which customers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Dell Computer uses data analyses of prospects to improve its customer
acquisition rate (Direct Marketing Association 2006).
</p>
<p>These are but a few examples of database marketing in action. The com-
mon theme is that all of them are based on analyzing customer data and
implementing the results.
</p>
<p>1.1.1 Defining Database Marketing
</p>
<p>While the above examples provide an idea as to what database marketing is
about, it is useful to formally define the topic. The National Center for Data-
base Marketing, quoted by Hughes (1996a, p. 4), defines database marketing
as:
</p>
<p>Managing a computerized relational database, in real time, of comprehensive, up-to-date,
relevant data on customers, inquiries, prospects and suspects, to identify our most respon-
sive customers for the purpose of developing a high quality, long-standing relationship of
repeat business by developing predictive models which enable us to send desired messages
at the right time in the right form to the right people &ndash; all with the result of pleasing our
customers, increasing our response rate per marketing dollar, lowering our cost per order,
building our business, and increasing our profits.
</p>
<p>While perhaps a bit long-winded, this definition in our view captures the
essentials of database marketing &ndash; analyzing customer data to enhance cus-
tomer value. A more succinct definition, which we advocate, is:
</p>
<p>Database marketing is the use of customer databases to enhance marketing productivity
through more effective acquisition, retention, and development of customers.
</p>
<p>Each phrase in this definition is carefully chosen. First, database marketing
is fundamentally about using of customer databases. The &ldquo;customer&rdquo; can be
either current customers or potential customers. Firms have data on their
current customers&rsquo; purchase behavior and demographic and psychographic
information, as well as the firm&rsquo;s previous marketing efforts extended to these
customers and their response to them. For potential customers &ndash; prospects &ndash;
firms may be able to obtain data on customer demographics and psycho-
graphics, as well as purchase history data, although obviously not in the
same depth as available for their current customers.
</p>
<p>Second, database marketing is about marketing productivity. In today&rsquo;s
results-oriented businesses, senior management often asks the simple ques-
tion, &ldquo;Do our marketing efforts pay off?&rdquo; Database marketing attempts to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.1 What Is Database Marketing? 5
</p>
<p>quantify that effectiveness and improve it. It does this through effective tar-
geting. The retail pioneer John Wannamaker is credited with saying, &ldquo;I know
half of my advertising doesn&rsquo;t work; I just don&rsquo;t know which half.&rdquo; Thinking
more broadly, in terms of marketing rather than advertising, database mar-
keting identifies which half of the firm&rsquo;s marketing efforts is wasted. It does
this by learning which customers respond to marketing and which ones do
not. The responsive customers are the ones who are then targeted.
</p>
<p>Third, database marketing is about managing customers. Customers must
be acquired, retained, and developed. Acquiring customers means getting an
individual who currently does not do business with the company to start
doing business with the company. Retention means ensuring the current cus-
tomer keeps doing business with the company. Development means enhanc-
ing the volume of business the retained customer does with the company.
A key concept in database marketing that captures these three factors is
&ldquo;customer equity&rdquo; (Blattberg et al. 2001), which we investigate in detail
when we discuss &ldquo;Acquisition and Retention Management&rdquo; in Chapter 26.
For now, the important point is to recognize that database marketing is con-
cerned with all three elements of customer equity. The Dell example above
involves customer acquisition. The ABC Telecom example involves customer
retention. The XYZ Bank, Tesco, and E-tailer Z examples involve customer
development.
</p>
<p>1.1.2 Database Marketing, Direct Marketing, and
Customer Relationship Management
</p>
<p>We can shed more light on the definition of database marketing by considering
its close cousins, direct marketing and customer relationship management
(CRM). Indeed, direct marketing and CRM overlap strongly with database
marketing. While each of the three concepts has its own nuances, the key
distinguishing characteristic of database marketing is its emphasis on the use
of customer databases.
</p>
<p>Customer relationship management emphasizes enhancing customer re-
lationships. That certainly is part of the definition of database marketing
(acquisition, retention, and development). However, firms can enhance cus-
tomer relationships without using data. The local clothing store&rsquo;s salesperson
gets to know individual customers through their repeated visits to the store.
The salesperson learns how to treat each customer and what their tastes
are. This produces and enhances a relationship between the store and the
customer. There is no formal analysis of databases. Essentially, the &ldquo;data&rdquo;
are the experiences remembered by the salesperson. Database marketing can
be viewed as an approach for large companies to develop relationships with
customers, because there are so many customers and so many salespersons</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>that it is impossible for every salesperson to really know each customer. Para-
doxically, the software and computer systems for compiling the data needed
to implement database marketing to enhance customer relationships have
been marketed as CRM software or technology.
</p>
<p>Direct marketing&rsquo;s emphasis is on &ldquo;addressability,&rdquo; the ability to interact
with a customer one-to-one (Blattberg and Deighton 1991). Addressability
is certainly a key aspect of database marketing, since targeting is the key
way that database marketing enhances marketing productivity. But direct
marketing can directly address customers simply by purchasing lists that
&ldquo;make sense,&rdquo; and sending customers on that list an offer. Note again, there
is no formal data analysis in this example. Database marketing emphasizes
the analysis of the data. In addition, while database marketing implemen-
tations often involve direct one-to-one contacts, this need not be always the
case. In the Best Buy example above, the first component of the applica-
tion is that the analysis of customer data drives the design of the store.
This is not direct marketing but it is database marketing. The second com-
ponent of the application, training salespeople to recognize particular mar-
ket segments as they shop in the store, is more along the lines of direct
marketing.
</p>
<p>In summary, database marketing, direct marketing, and customer rela-
tionship highly overlap. They differ in points of emphasis &ndash; database market-
ing emphasizes the analysis of customer data, direct marketing emphasizes
addressability, and customer relationship management emphasizes the cus-
tomer relationship. However, many people who call themselves direct mar-
keters certainly analyze customer data. And many CRM applications soft-
ware companies emphasize customer data. So customer data analysis is not
the exclusive domain of database marketing &ndash; it&rsquo;s just database marketing&rsquo;s
specialty.
</p>
<p>1.2 Why Is Database Marketing Becoming
More Important?
</p>
<p>It is difficult to find statistics that document the size of the database mar-
keting industry. Some suggestive numbers are: (1) The market for &ldquo;CRM
Software&rdquo; is valued at $7.773 billion in 2005 and expected to grow to $10.940
billion by 2010 (Band 2006). (2) As of 2004, 100 of the top 376 companies
in the Fortune 500 list of US corporations are members of the Direct Mar-
keting Association, the trade association for direct marketing (Direct Mar-
keting Association 2004, pp. 22&ndash;23). (3) In 2004, 39.153 million US adults
bought products through the mail (Direct Marketing Association 2004, p. 29).
(4) Business-to-business direct marketing advertising expenditures totaled
$107 billion in 2003, and are expected to increase to $135 billion by 2007</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.2 Why Is Database Marketing Becoming More Important? 7
</p>
<p>(Direct Marketing Association 2004, p. 167). These numbers provide indica-
tions of the size of the industry, but do not include budgets for marketing
analytics groups that analyze the data, for campaigns that implement data-
base marketing programs, or for the multitude of service firms (advertising
agencies, data compilers, and list management firms), that account for sig-
nificant expenditures.
</p>
<p>The indications are that the database marketing industry is huge and in-
creasing. The question is, why? We hypothesize five major classes of reasons:
</p>
<p>&bull; Information technology : Companies now have the ability to store and ma-
nipulate terabytes of data. While the software to do so is expensive, the
capabilities are dramatic.
</p>
<p>&bull; Growth of the Internet : The Internet is a data-collection &ldquo;machine.&rdquo; Many
companies that previously could not collect and organize data on their
customers can now do so through the Internet.
</p>
<p>&bull; Lower productivity of mass marketing : While there are no good statis-
tics on this, there is the belief that mass advertising and non-customized
marketing efforts are eliciting poorer response, while costs are increasing
and margins are declining. One can write the profitability of a marketing
campaign as Π = Npm&minus;Nc, where N is the number of customers reached
by the campaign, p is the percentage that respond, m is the contribution
margin when they respond, and c is the cost of contact per customer. For
a campaign to be profitability, we need p &gt; c/m. Unfortunately, all three
of these terms are moving in the wrong direction. Response is lower (p),
costs are higher (c), and margins are lower (m). Database marketing tar-
gets customers for whom response is maximal, helping the profit equation
to remain in the black.
</p>
<p>&bull; Marketing accountability : Results-oriented senior managers are requiring
all business functions to justify their existence, including marketing. No
longer is it taken on faith that &ldquo;marketing works&rdquo; or &ldquo;marketing is a cost
of doing business.&rdquo; The demands of senior managers for proven results
feed directly into database marketing&rsquo;s emphasis on analyzing data and
measuring results.
</p>
<p>&bull; Increasing interest in customer relationships: Companies are more con-
cerned than ever about their relationship with the customer. They see
their products commoditizing and customer loyalty wilting away. Data-
base marketing is a systematic way to improve customer relationships.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establishing a competitive advantage: Companies are always trying to de-
termine what will be their source of competitive advantage. Perhaps that
source lies in the data they have on their own customers, which allows
them to service those customers better through database marketing.
</p>
<p>We will discuss the marketing productivity, customer relationship, and com-
petitive advantage issues in depth in Chapter 2, because they essentially de-
fine the database marketing strategy of the firm.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.1 The database marketing process.
</p>
<p>1.3 The Database Marketing Process
</p>
<p>Database marketing is implemented through a process depicted in Fig. 1.1.
The process originates in an environment characterized by the firm&rsquo;s over-
all database marketing strategy, its organization, and legal issues (especially
privacy). These factors determine the nature of problems the firm faces, and
how they will be solved. The firm then needs to define the particular prob-
lem it wishes to address through database marketing. This entails a situation
analysis, a statement of objectives, and an outline of the methodology that
will solve the problem. For example, a firm whose DBM strategy emphasizes
customer relationships may notice that it is losing too many customers. The
objective may be to reduce the &ldquo;churn rate&rdquo; from 20% to 15% per year.
The firm therefore decides to design a proactive churn management program
(Chapter 24) with its attendant data requirements and statistical tools. Most
of the work can be done internally because the company has the organiza-
tional capability in terms of information technology, marketing analytics, and
campaign implementation. The company can then proceed to compile and an-
alyze the data. The analysis yields a campaign design that is implemented
and evaluated.
</p>
<p>There are two key feedback loops in this process. First is the learning that
takes place over time. After a program is evaluated, it provides guidance on
what types of issues can be addressed successfully by database marketing,
what data are most valuable for providing insights and for predicting cus-
tomer behavior, how to analyze the data, and how to translate the analysis
into program design and implementation. This learning and the expertise
it breeds is one way in which database marketing can become a competi-
tive advantage for the firm. The second feedback loop is that each database
marketing campaign provides data for use in future analyses to solve future
problems. For example, customer response to a catalog mailing is used to
update &ldquo;recency&rdquo;, &ldquo;frequency&rdquo;, and &ldquo;monetary&rdquo; (RFM) variables for each
customer. These become part of the database and are used to develop future
targeting strategies.</p>

<p>1.3 The Database Marketing Process 9
</p>
<p>Table 1.1 Database marketing activities
</p>
<p>Table 1.1 provides a list of database marketing activities &ndash; essentially, a
list of the marketing problems addressed by database marketing. These in-
clude acquiring customers, retaining and developing customers, coordinating
acquisition, retention, and development, and managing the marketing mix.
Several of the sub-issues within each of these merit their own chapter in this
book. For example, we will devote full chapters to cross- and up-selling, mul-
tichannel customer management, etc. These are all very challenging problems
and much work has been done on using database marketing to manage them
more effectively.
</p>
<p>Because of the focus on analyzing customer data, several data analysis
techniques have emerged and been applied by database marketers. Table 1.2
lists these techniques. The two most basic analyses are lifetime value of the
customer and predictive modeling. Lifetime value of the customer is the net
present value of the incremental revenues and costs generated by an acquired
customer. The reason LTV is so important is that it includes the long-term</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Table 1.2 Database marketing analysis techniques
</p>
<p>retention and development aspects of managing the customer. We devote
three chapters to calculating and applying LTV. Predictive modeling is the
most common form of analysis conducted by database marketers. It pertains
to the use of statistical analysis to predict future customer behavior &ndash; will the
customer churn, will the customer buy from this catalog, will the customer
become more loyal if routed to the top-tier call center, will the customer
be receptive to this recommended product? Predictive modeling is itself a
process, and we devote a chapter to studying this process.
</p>
<p>For the statistically oriented individual, &ldquo;your ship has come in&rdquo; when
it comes to database marketing. Table 1.2 shows the multitude of methods
used by database marketers. The reason why so many techniques have found
application is partly due to the variety of problems to be addressed &ndash; e.g.,
collaborative filtering and market-basket analysis can be readily applied to
cross-selling, hazard models are useful for predicting how long the customer
will remain a customer; logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks
are all useful for predicting &ldquo;0&ndash;1&rdquo; behavior such as, will the customer respond,
or will the customer churn?
</p>
<p>However, in addition to the variety of problems stimulating the variety of
techniques, the other reason for the plethora of statistical techniques that are
applied by database marketers is the frantic race to achieve higher predictive
accuracy. As we will see several times in this book, even a nominal increase
in predictive accuracy can mean $100,000s in added profits for a single cam-
paign. Each bit of information we can squeeze out of the data can be directly</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1.3 The Database Marketing Process 11
</p>
<p>Table 1.3 Organization of the book
</p>
<p>linked to marketing profitability and efficiency. For example, if a predictive
model can increase response to a direct mail offer from 1% to 2%, this can
literally make the difference between a huge loss and a huge gain. The reason
is that while the percentage change is small, it is multiplied by 100,000s of
customers, if not millions. In this way, the benefits of marginal increases in
predictive accuracy add up, and we have a cornucopia of statistical techniques
that compete for the title, &ldquo;most accurate.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
<p>1.4 Organization of the Book
</p>
<p>We have organized the book according to Table 1.3. Part I deals with the
issues that shape the database marketing process &ndash; firm strategy, firm orga-
nization, and the legal environment. Chapter 2, &ldquo;Why Database Marketing&rdquo;,
relates to the firm&rsquo;s database marketing strategy, positing three fundamen-
tal reasons why companies might want to engage in database marketing:
improving marketing productivity, improving customer relationships, or es-
tablishing competitive advantage. As discussed earlier, which of these reasons
is the impetus for database marketing at a particular firm will influence the
rest of the DBM process &ndash; which problems the firm attempts to solve, and
how it tries to solve them. Chapter 3 deals with how to organize the firm&rsquo;s
marketing function in order to implement database marketing. Chapter 4
represents the legal environment, in particular, the issue of customer privacy.
This certainly determines the types of database marketing efforts the firm
can undertake.
</p>
<p>Parts II&ndash;IV of the book deal with database marketing tools &ndash; how to collect
the data and do the analysis. Chapters 5&ndash;7 focus on the key concept of life-
time value of the customer (LTV). Chapters 8&ndash;10 focus on the basic tasks of
compiling data, field testing, and predictive modeling. Chapters 11&ndash;19 cover
the statistical methods used primarily in predictive modeling.
</p>
<p>PartsV and VI focus on specific problems addressed by database mar-
keting. They largely draw on the tools described in Parts II&ndash;IV. PartV cov-
ers customer management activities including Acquiring Customers (Chap-
ter 20), Cross- and Up-selling (Chapter 21), Frequency Reward Programs
(Chapter 22), Customer Tier Programs (Chapter 23), Churn management
(Chapter 24), Multichannel Customer Management (Chapter 25), and Ac-
quisition and Retention Management (Chapter 26). PartVI focuses on the
marketing mix, particularly communications (Chapters 27 and 28) and Pric-
ing (Chapter 29).

<p>The result is intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the field of
database marketing, including strategic issues, tools, and problem-solving.</p>

<p>Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>Abstract A basic yet crucial question is: why should the firm engage in
database marketing? We discuss three fundamental motivations: enhancing
marketing productivity, creating and enhancing customer relationships, and
creating sustainable competitive advantage. We review the theoretical and
empirical evidence in support of each of these motivations. Marketing pro-
ductivity has the best support; there is some evidence for both customer
relationships and competitive advantage as well, but further work is needed.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most fundamental question we can ask about any marketing
activity is what is its raison d&rsquo;etre &ndash; what purpose does it serve in enhancing
firm performance? In this chapter, we propose and evaluate three reasons for
database marketing:
</p>
<p>&bull; Enhancing marketing productivity
&bull; Enabling the development of a customer/firm relationship
&bull; Creating a sustainable competitive advantage
</p>
<p>2.1 Enhancing Marketing Productivity
</p>
<p>2.1.1 The Basic Argument
</p>
<p>The pioneering retail entrepreneur, John Wannamaker, is said to have
lamented about the inefficiency of his marketing efforts, &ldquo;I know that half of
my marketing is wasted; my problem is that I just don&rsquo;t know which half.&rdquo;
The promise of database marketing is to identify which marketing efforts are
wasted and which are productive, thereby allowing the firm to focus on the
efforts that are productive. Database marketing does this by identifying cus-
tomers for whom the marketing effort will pay off, and then targeting those
customers. In this view, database marketing is fundamentally a segmentation
and targeting tool for enhancing marketing productivity.

<p>14 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>Table 2.1 The economics of database marketing: A prospecting example
</p>
<p>&bull; Untargeted Mailing
Number of offers mailed: 1,000,000
Profit contribution per response: $80
Cost per mailing: $0.70
Response rate: 1%
</p>
<p>Profit = 1,000,000&times; 0.01&times; $80&minus; 1,000,000&times; $0.70
= $800,000&minus; $700,000
= $100,000
</p>
<p>&bull; Targeted mailing
</p>
<p>Decile Number Response Profit ($) Cumulative
of prospects rate (%) Profit ($)
</p>
<p>1 100,000 3.00% 170,000 170,000
2 100,000 2.00 90,000 260,000
3 100,000 1.40 42,000 302,000
4 100,000 1.15 22,000 324,000
5 100,000 1.00 10,000 334,000
6 100,000 0.60 &minus;22,000 312,000
7 100,000 0.40 &minus;38,000 274,000
8 100,000 0.30 &minus;46,000 228,000
9 100,000 0.10 &minus;62,000 166,000
</p>
<p>10 100,000 0.05 &minus;66,000 100,000
Total 1,000,000 1.00% $100,000
</p>
<p>=&gt; Target first five deciles (Profit = $334,000)
</p>
<p>The power of this argument can be seen in the example shown in Table 2.1.
The example depicts the economics of a direct marketing campaign whose
goal is to profitably sell a new product to a list of 1,000,000 potential
&ldquo;prospects.&rdquo; Each prospect who &ldquo;responds&rdquo; to the offer generates $80 in
profit. The cost to extend the offer is $0.70, including costs of mailing and
printing of the mail piece. Assuming a 1% response rate &ndash; fairly typically for
a large-scale mailing &ndash; profit would be:
</p>
<p>Profit = 1,000,000&times; 1% response&times; $80/response
&minus;1,000,000&times; $0.70/contact = $100,000
</p>
<p>The mailing is profitable. However, the above calculation illustrates Wanna-
maker&rsquo;s perspective taken to an extreme &minus;99% of the marketing expenditures
were wasted! Only 10,000 will respond to the offer, yet we are mailing to
1,000,000 customers to find those responders. This unfortunately is a typical
outcome for many marketing expenditures. The cost is not only lost profits
to the firm, but wasted &ldquo;junk mail&rdquo; and advertising clutter as well. If we
could eliminate some of that waste, profits could be increased and perhaps
society itself could be better served.
</p>
<p>The lower portion of Table 2.1 shows how the results can be improved
with database marketing. The prospect list is segmented into deciles, 100,000
in each decile, prioritized by their likelihood of responding to the offer.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.1 Enhancing Marketing Productivity 15
</p>
<p>The prioritization is determined by a process called predictive modeling
(Chapter 10). Predictive modeling identifies a top decile of customers who
have a response rate of 3%. The second decile has a response rate of 2%, etc.,
down to the 10th decile, which has a response rate of 0.05%. The profits from
targeting the first decile would be 100,000 &times; 3% response &times; $80/response &minus;
100,000 &times; $0.70/contact = $170,000. Targeting this decile alone would yield
more profit than targeting the entire list. The key is that we are saving on
the mailing costs &ndash; &ldquo;only&rdquo; 97%, not 99%, of the mail costs are wasted in this
segment.
</p>
<p>Going through the calculations for each decile, we see that it would be
profitable to target the top 5 deciles, yielding a cumulative profit of $334,000,
much higher than the $100,000 gained by targeting the full list.
</p>
<p>Database marketing allows firms to segment their customers according to
&ldquo;lift tables&rdquo; such as in Table 2.1, and then deliver the marketing effort to
the customers whom the analysis predicts will be profitable. The key to the
profit improvement is that the top deciles have substantially higher response
rates than the lower deciles. The ratio of response rate in a decile to the
average response rate is known as &ldquo;lift.&rdquo; Note that a first-decile lift of 3 to 1
(3% response for that decile divided by 1% for the entire database) is enough
to enhance profits significantly. The lift for the top 5 deciles is 1.71%/1% =
1.71. Lift levels of this magnitude are quite feasible given current statistical
technology. This provides a fundamental reason for firms to employ database
marketing &ndash; it increases the profits generated by marketing campaigns by
targeting customers more effectively.
</p>
<p>2.1.2 The Marketing Productivity Argument in Depth
</p>
<p>The marketing productivity argument for database marketing follows from
the recognition of three major forces: (a) a major problem of mass market-
ing (e.g., traditional electronic media such as television) is lack of targeting
and database marketing provides the ability to target, (b) marketing needs
to be accountable and database marketing provides accountability, and (c)
mass marketing efforts are difficult to assess and adjust, whereas database
marketing provides a process for learning how to target more effectively.
</p>
<p>2.1.2.1 Database Marketing as a Solution to Targeting
Inefficiencies of Mass Marketing
</p>
<p>Beginning with Wannamaker&rsquo;s observation that half his advertising was
wasted, marketers have long lamented their inability to target efforts ef-
fectively. For example, mass media advertising can be targeted only to a
limited degree. Market research services identify demographic characteristics</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>and product preferences associated with particular television shows, or geo-
graphic regions, but this produces nowhere near the desired level of individual
targetability.
</p>
<p>Blattberg and Deighton (1991) pioneered the notion that data technol-
ogy can improve targeting in their concept of the &ldquo;addressable consumer.&rdquo;
Their main point was that database marketing could create a dialogue be-
tween the customer and the company, whereby the company would learn the
responses of individual customers and respond to their needs. This was a
radical departure from mass media. Deighton et al. (1994) elaborated on this
theme: &ldquo;At its most sophisticated, then, a transaction database is a record
of the conversation between a firm and each [italics added] of its customers,
in which the firm&rsquo;s offering evolves as the dialogue unfolds&rdquo; (p. 60).
</p>
<p>Coincident with the conceptual argument that data technology could im-
prove targeting was the practical observation that the costs of maintaining
and storing databases had decreased rapidly. Blattberg and Deighton (1991)
maintained that &ldquo;the cost of holding a consumer&rsquo;s name, address, and pur-
chase history on line has fallen by a factor of a thousand since 1970 and
is continuing to fall at this rate.&rdquo; Sheth and Sisodia (1995b) report that
&ldquo;Computing power that used to cost a million dollars can be had today
for less than a dollar.&rdquo; Peppers and Rogers (1993, pp. 13&ndash;14) echo similar
themes.
</p>
<p>Second was the observation that the tools for extracting the necessary
learning from the data (to construct the lift table in Table 2.1) were available
and getting better. This led to an explosive growth in &ldquo;data mining&rdquo; (e.g.,
Peacock 1998). Peacock defines data mining as &ldquo;the automated discovery
of &lsquo;interesting,&rsquo; nonobvious patterns hidden in a database that have a high
potential for contributing to the bottom line . . . &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; relationships are
those that could have an impact on strategy or tactics and ultimately on an
organization&rsquo;s objectives.&rdquo; He cites a few examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; Marriott&rsquo;s Vacation Club used data mining to cut the level of direct mail
needed to accomplish a desired response level. This is a prime illustration
of Table 2.1.
</p>
<p>&bull; Prudential Insurance tested the results of data mining for improved re-
sponse rates among prospects, and found them to be doubled.
</p>
<p>&bull; American Express used data mining to &ldquo;score&rdquo; customers in terms of how
likely they were to purchase various items. It then used these data to
generate offers that match the products of its partners with the needs of
its customers.
</p>
<p>In summary, the recognition that targeting was the problem with mass mar-
keting, that database marketing could theoretically improve targeting, that
database costs were declining, and that data mining was effective in prac-
tice at developing the targeting plans, contributed mightily to the growth in
database marketing as a tool for improving marketing productivity.</p>

<p>2.1 Enhancing Marketing Productivity 17
</p>
<p>2.1.2.2 Marketing Accountability and the ROI Perspective
</p>
<p>Emerging from the period of high inflation in the 1970s, senior manage-
ment became very concerned with costs &ndash; production, labor, and materials.
Webster (1981) (see also Lodish 1986) reported that by the early 1980s,
CEO&rsquo;s had begun to focus on marketing. The fact that it was general man-
agers &ndash; the CEO&rsquo;s &ndash; who were calling attention to marketing meant two
things. First, the issue was broader than costs. It was productivity in the sense
of Return on Investment (ROI), i.e., how much profit was being generated
per marketing dollar. Second, marketing needed to be accountable, so that
marketing productivity needed to be measured. Sheth and Sisodia (1995a)
report that by the mid-1990s, &ldquo;CEO&rsquo;s are demanding major cost savings and
a higher level of accountability from marketing than ever before.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>As illustrated in Table 2.1, database marketing fulfills the need to measure
ROI. Rather than spending $700,000 to produce a profit of $100,000 (an
&ldquo;ROI&rdquo; of 15%), database marketing would spend $350,000 to produce a profit
of $334,000 (an ROI of 95%).1 Expenditures have decreased and profits have
increased. The key however is that the results are measurable. The entire
database marketing mentality is based on measuring results. In Table 2.1, it
is relatively simple since response can be measured and tabulated, and the
costs can be calculated.
</p>
<p>Costs, at least direct costs, are almost always easy to measure in a direct
marketing context. Incremental revenues are sometimes difficult to measure,
however, because it is not clear what response would have been without
the marketing campaign. This is where the role of experimentation and
learning comes in. For example, assume that in Table 2.1, it was possible
that consumers could buy the product even without a direct mail campaign,
e.g., through a different sales channel. The database marketer would then
design an experiment by creating a control groups. Rather than mailing to
all 100,000 prospects in Decile 1, he or she would mail to just 90,000, holding
10,000 aside as controls. The incremental gain from the campaign could
then be calculated as the response rate for the 90,000 minus the &ldquo;response&rdquo;
rate for the 10,000. The ease of conducting experiments plays a key role
in measuring the results of database marketing, hence in making database
marketing accountable.
</p>
<p>While marketing ROI is naturally measured as profit generated per incre-
mental expenditure divided by the investment, there are many other ways to
measure it. Sheth and Sisodia (1995a, b) propose that marketing productivity
be measured as a weighted average of customer acquisition productivity and
customer retention productivity. Customer acquisition productivity would
</p>
<p>1 Note it is not clear that firms should maximize ROI rather than the absolute level of
profits. ROI may be maximized at a lower level of expenditure than would maximize
profits (see Table 2.1, where targeting just the first decile would maximize ROI, while
targeting the first 5 deciles will maximize profits). (The authors thank Preyas Desai for
these insights.)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>consist of revenues generated by new customers divided by expenditures on
acquiring new customers, &ldquo;adjusted by a customer satisfaction index&rdquo; (p. 11).
The adjustment serves to quantify the long-run benefits of this acquisition.
Customer retention productivity would consist of revenues from existing cus-
tomers divided by expenditures for serving existing customers, adjusted by a
&ldquo;customer loyalty index,&rdquo; again to bring in the long-term value of the invest-
ment. There are several practical issues in constructing these measures, but
the emphasis on acquisition and retention plays to the very definition of data-
base marketing (the use of customer databases to increase the effectiveness of
marketing in acquiring and retaining customers). We add that cross-selling
or up-selling customers is also very important. Once a firm has a customer,
the ability to sell additional products through database marketing provides
the firm a significant advantage (Blattberg et al. 2001).
</p>
<p>2.1.2.3 Database Marketing as a Learning System
</p>
<p>Mass marketing efforts are difficult to assess and adjust. While marketing mix
modeling has become very popular and generates useful results, a key limita-
tion is the difficulty and cost in setting up controlled experiments. Database
marketing is a learning marketing system because firms use both experimen-
tation and data mining techniques to learn about the effectiveness of their
marketing mix decisions and about their customers&rsquo; behavior, and then ad-
justs these decisions accordingly. Experimentation is fundamental to database
marketing. In its extreme database marketers test micro tactical decisions
such as the color of the paper used in a direct marketing campaign or the
greeting used in telemarketing. While very tactical, experimentation means
that database marketers can learn from their &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; &ndash; unsuccessful copy,
pricing or offers &ndash; and can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their
marketing activities.
</p>
<p>Traditional mass marketers in theory can set up experiments but they
are prone to small sample sizes, difficulty creating controls and high costs.
Tools such as IRI&rsquo;s Behavior Scan can be used in the consumer packaged
goods industry to test advertising. However, for most products that can not
be tracked with consumer panels, this option does not exist. Hence, database
marketing has a significant advantage to firms because of the ability of the
firm to experiment, learn, and adjust.
</p>
<p>Database marketers such as Amazon now use more sophisticated targeting
tools to learn about their customers&rsquo; behavior and then use this to cross-sell
other products. One technique used to analyze customer behavior and make
product recommendations is called collaborative filtering (Chapter 14). This
and similar techniques use purchase histories and other information to deter-
mine the likelihood a customer will purchase a related product. For example,
Amazon uses a customer&rsquo;s book purchase history to make a recommendation
of books the customer might be interested in purchasing.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.1 Enhancing Marketing Productivity 19
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.1 The learning marketing system fostered by database marketing.
</p>
<p>We call the process of implementing database marketing campaigns, learn-
ing, and adjusting a &ldquo;learning marketing system&rdquo;. This system is depicted
in Fig. 2.1. The figure shows that the firm uses information it collects in
the process of acquiring and retaining customers to update its strategy
for interacting with customers. This entails the product offering, commu-
nications, price, and promotion. The firm is able to target these elements
more effectively because it has learned about consumer preferences and
responsiveness.
</p>
<p>A learning marketing system can also provide a competitive advantage to a
firm because, if carefully crafted, it can provide better product recommenda-
tions and more targeted communications to the customer than if the customer
switches companies and makes his or her first purchase from a competitor.
That competitor does not have the information available to customize prod-
uct recommendations and communications. Amazon should therefore have a
significant advantage relative to Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders because it has
been tracking customer purchase much longer and offering recommendations
throughout the customer&rsquo;s purchase experience with Amazon.
</p>
<p>2.1.3 Evidence for the Marketing
Productivity Argument
</p>
<p>Table 2.1 suggests two crucial components to the marketing productivity ar-
gument for database marketing. First is that predictive modeling generates
lift tables that separate customers who will respond from those who will
not. Second is that these tables actually predict what will happen once the
marketing campaign is launched.
</p>
<p>There are several examples to demonstrate the feasibility of lift tables
(&ldquo;charts&rdquo; when shown graphically). Figure 2.2 is from Ansari and Mela (2003)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.2 Lift chart for an e-mail campaign (From Ansari and Mela 2003).
</p>
<p>on targeted e-mail. The goal was to use e-mail to generate visits to an
information-oriented website. As the figure shows, the average response rate
was 20%. However, the authors were able to separate customers into deciles
such that customers in the first 3 deciles had a response rate of 40%, a 2 to 1
lift. See Sheppard (1999) and Chapter 10 for a detailed discussion of lift tables.
</p>
<p>Figure 2.3 shows a lift chart for predicting which credit card customers
will close their accounts (i.e., &ldquo;churn&rdquo;). Predictions are based on customer
behavior over the previous six months. As the chart shows, those in the
top decile have a 7% chance of churning, compared to an average of less
than 1% over the entire customer base. The top decile customers could be
targeted with a customer retention program &ndash; perhaps a new offer, or simply
a reminder of the favorable features of their credit card.
</p>
<p>Figure 2.4 shows the predicted &ldquo;next-product-to-buy&rdquo; adoption of web
banking for a retail bank (Knott et al. 2002). The most important variable
for making these predictions was products currently owned by customers.
</p>

burgh, PA, ModelMax Demonstration Data).</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.1 Enhancing Marketing Productivity 21
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.4 Lift chart for predicting adoption of web banking using a next-product-to-buy
(NPTB) model (From Knott et al. 2002).
</p>
<p>The average adoption rate is 2.3%; the adoption rate in the top 3 deciles is
5%. These customers appear to be good prospects for a web banking direct
mail piece.
</p>
<p>In all three examples, the database marketer uses predictive models to
separate customers in segments (deciles) in prioritized order of their partaking
in some behavior &ndash; be it response to an e-mail, giving up a credit card, or
adopting a new product. Different actions are called for depending on the
decile in which a given customer falls.
</p>
<p>These results are impressive and show customers can be segmented using
predictive models. Note this is not the traditional form of segmentation used
in marketing text books. It is segmentation based on the likelihood of buying
determined from statistical models. A critical question is: does targeting im-
plied by lift charts actually result in higher revenues and profits? Figure 2.5
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.5 Revenues from field-tested cross-selling campaign (From Knott et al. 2002).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>shows one example from Knott et al. (2002). A predictive model was used to
prioritize customers according to their likelihood of purchasing a home eq-
uity loan. The top prospects were then targeted with a direct mail campaign.
Note that this tests the ability of the predictive model predictions to hold up
when the targeting actually occurs, subsequently to the modeling.
</p>
<p>Figure 2.5 shows the targeted mailing generated revenues of $93 per
mailed-to customer. However, customers could have obtained a loan through
other means, for example, simply by walking up to the bank and applying.
Did the mailing generated incremental revenue above what would have been
obtained through the usual marketing channel? To answer this, the authors
in advance set up a control group consisting of customers who were predicted
by the model to be top prospects, but were randomly selected not to receive
the direct mail piece. It turned out that some of these people did obtain
loans on their own, but revenues for this group were only $37 per customer.
Finally, the question arises as to whether the model &ndash; based on a neural
net &ndash; worked better than a simple heuristic. In this case, the heuristic was
to target direct mail pieces for the loan to wealthier customers. As Fig. 2.5
shows, this heuristic barely produced any additional revenues compared to
its control group.
</p>
<p>Knott et al. (2002) suggest three key findings. First, targeted campaigns
based on predictive models produce higher revenues. Second, the revenues
are incremental over what would have been achieved through existing mar-
keting efforts. Third, the model outperforms a reasonable but non-statistical
heuristic. Overall, we see measurable improved performance from targeting.2
</p>
<p>That is one of the promises of database marketing.
The above examples suggest that statistical methods can create beneficial
</p>
<p>targeting efforts. One consideration is costs. As we saw earlier, the costs
include: compilation of a database, the lift chart capabilities generated by a
given investment, and average contact expenses with and without database
marketing. Industries that naturally maintain customer databases, such as
services and catalogs, obviously will find the database costs less expensive.
</p>
<p>2.1.4 Assessment
</p>
<p>The argument that database marketing&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;etre is to improve market-
ing productivity is compelling. It is based on (1) the recognition that effec-
tive targeting is crucial and that database marketing can deliver it, (2) that
modern marketers are accountable and that database marketing can mea-
sure ROI, and (3) that learning and refinement is key to effective marketing
and database marketing is indeed a learning process. These forces should

profits increase as well.</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 Creating and Enhancing Customer Relationships 23
</p>
<p>continue into the future. In addition, the targeting and ROI components of
the argument have received direct empirical support.
</p>
<p>While the marketing productivity argument is indeed powerful and
undoubtedly has contributed to the growth of database marketing, the pro-
ductivity argument is largely tactical. It focuses on the profitability of indi-
vidual marketing campaigns. It leaves out two fundamental issues, developing
customer relationships and establishing a competitive advantage. These two
issues will be the focus of the next two sections of this chapter.
</p>
<p>2.2 Creating and Enhancing Customer Relationships
</p>
<p>2.2.1 The Basic Argument
</p>
<p>The argument is that (1) strong customer relationships are good because
they go hand-in-hand with brand loyalty, and (2) database marketing can be
used to create and enhance customer relationships.
</p>
<p>2.2.2 Customer Relationships and the Role
of Database Marketing
</p>
<p>2.2.2.1 The Emergence of Customer Relationships
as an Area of Marketing Focus
</p>
<p>Among the first researchers to articulate the CRM argument for database
marketing was Berry (1983). Berry urged marketers to be &ldquo;thinking of mar-
keting in terms of having customers, not merely acquiring customers,&rdquo; (p. 25),
and defined relationship marketing as &ldquo;attracting, maintaining, and enhanc-
ing customer relationships in multi-service organizations.&rdquo; The importance
of customer relationships was echoed by Webster (1992, p. 1): &ldquo;Customer
relationships will be seen as the key strategic resource of the business.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Berry outlined a number of relationship marketing strategies, including
&ldquo;customizing the relationship&rdquo;, which was an especially attractive strategy
when &ldquo;personal service capabilities are combined with electronic data process-
ing capabilities.&rdquo; He describes examples at Xerox, American Express, and
other companies where service capabilities were enhanced by customer data
records. The key notion was that a customer service representative could cul-
tivate a stronger relationship with the customer by having instant access to
the customer&rsquo;s data file.
</p>
<p>Berry&rsquo;s emphasis on relationships stemmed from the idea of enhancing cus-
tomer service. Webster&rsquo;s emphasis on relationships stemmed from a desire to
move the definition of marketing toward one based on social and economic</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>processes rather than functional tasks (the 4 P&rsquo;s). More recently, the motiva-
tion for emphasizing customer relationships stems from the simple economics
of lifetime value. The lifetime profits or &ldquo;customer equity&rdquo; delivered by a set
of N customers can be written as (see Chapter 5):
</p>
<p>Profits = N
&infin;&sum;
t=0
</p>
<p>(R&minus; c&minus;m)rt
(1 + δ)t
</p>
<p>&minus;Na (2.1)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>N = Number of customers acquired.
a = Acquisition cost per customer.
R = Revenues per period per customer.
c = COGS per period per customer.
m = Ongoing marketing costs per period per customer.
δ = Discount rate.
r = Retention rate, i.e., the percentage of customers who are retained year
</p>
<p>to year.
</p>
<p>Equation 2.1 can be re-written as:
</p>
<p>Profits = N(R&minus; c)
(
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)
(1 + δ &minus; r)
</p>
<p>)
&minus;Nm
</p>
<p>(
(1 + δ)
</p>
<p>(1 + δ &minus; r)
)
&minus;Na (2.2)
</p>
<p>where the first term is long-term profit contribution, the second term is long-
term retention costs of marketing, and the third term is total acquisition
costs. The emphasis on customer relationships is consistent with the fact
that Equation 2.2 is a convex function of retention rate as opposed to a linear
function of the number of acquired customers.
</p>
<p>The convexity of long-term profits with respect to retention rate can be
seen in Fig. 2.6. The implication is that an increase in retention rate by 20%
increases profits more than increasing the number of customers (N) by 20%.
</p>
<p>The benefits of customer retention have been reinforced by several re-
searchers. Winer (2001) reports a McKinsey study that investigated how
acquisition versus retention affects the market value of Internet firms. The
study concluded that retention was far more powerful than acquisition.
Reichheld (1996) found that small increases in retention have dramatic im-
pact on total profits. Gupta et al. (2004a) reached similar conclusions.
</p>
<p>A relationship management strategy is partly predicated on the belief that:
(a) retaining customers is less expensive than acquiring new customers and
(b) increasing retention is more valuable than increasing acquisition. The
above discussion suggests a solid foundation for the revenue side. Unfortu-
nately there is not a solid foundation for the cost side. It may be far more
costly, or impossible, to increase retention rates from 80% to 90% than it is
to increase acquisition rates from 1% to 5%. Generalizations about the costs
of increasing intention rates have not been well documented. This is an em-
pirical question and may be firm specific. See Chapter 26 for more discussion
of acquisition versus retention strategies.</p>

</p>
<p>Another impetus for the importance of relationships was research in the
1990s that showed a linkage from relationship strength to customer satisfac-
tion to loyalty to firm performance. Several studies have investigated all or
part of the satisfaction-loyalty-performance linkage. Anderson et al. (1994)
used a three-equation model to describe the evolution of customer expecta-
tions, satisfaction, and return on assets. Their analysis was at the company
level-77 Swedish firms across a wide variety of industries. The critical find-
ing was a strong link between satisfaction and return-on-investment (ROA).
They did not investigate brand loyalty per se but did hypothesize that one
reason for a link between satisfaction and ROA is higher loyalty.
</p>
<p>Rust and Zahorik (1993) model this more formally. They present a broad
model that captures the relationship between satisfaction, retention, and mar-
ket share. While they do not estimate the entire model, they provide an ex-
ample where they predict retention likelihood for a retail bank as a function
of satisfaction factors. The most important satisfaction factor influencing re-
tention is &ldquo;Warmth,&rdquo; which includes elements such as &ldquo;friendliness,&rdquo; &ldquo;how
well the manager knows me,&rdquo; &ldquo;listens to my needs,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;convenience
to home.&rdquo; Most of these elements are basically indicators of the strength of
the customer relationship.
</p>
<p>Barnes (2000) studied 400 customers&rsquo; relationships with companies from
a variety of industries, including financial institutions, grocery stores, and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>telecommunications. He measured the closeness, strength, and emotional
tone of the relationship, and found that closeness correlated strongly with
satisfaction.
</p>
<p>Bolton (1998) studied the effect of satisfaction on the length of the re-
lationship. She found that prior cumulative satisfaction directly affects the
length of the duration of the relationship. She also shows that the effect of
transaction or service failures on duration times depends upon prior satis-
faction. Her results show a direct relationship between customer satisfaction
and the lifetime value of a customer.
</p>
<p>Together, the above papers trace a relationship from the customer relation-
ship to customer satisfaction to loyalty/retention to higher firm performance.
They cement the argument that relationships are important because they in-
crease retention, and retention is an attractive way to build firm performance.
</p>
<p>2.2.2.2 The Role of Database Marketing in Establishing
Customer Relationships
</p>
<p>The previous discussion established the importance of customer relationships.
What is needed next is to establish that database marketing is a way to
establish relationships.
</p>
<p>Fournier (1998) presented the conceptual foundation for customer-brand
relationships, and provided exploratory evidence that relationships are a valid
behavioral construct. Her conceptual foundation, based on the work of Hinde
(1995), was that a relationship involves four aspects: (1) reciprocal exchange
between the partners in the relationship, (2) purpose in that relationships
satisfy goals of both participants, (3) multiplex in that they take on many
different forms, and (4) a process, in that they evolve over time.
</p>
<p>All four dimensions map to the capabilities of database marketing. The
reciprocal exchange is that customers give firms data and firms give customers
better products and service. The goals to be satisfied are profits for the firm
and overall utility for the customer. The multiplex nature of relationships
suggests that there must be several &ldquo;touch points&rdquo; where customers and firms
interact, and all must be managed. Database marketing has the capability to
manage these touch points. But the strongest fit between database marketing
and relationships involves the notion that relationships are processes that
evolve over time. The nature of database marketing is to collect data, take
action, evaluate the action, collect more data, take more actions, etc. The
customer data file and the conclusions one can draw from it evolve over time,
as relationships should by their very nature.
</p>
<p>Fournier&rsquo;s work suggests that database marketing and relationships bond
at a conceptual level. Peppers and Rogers (1993, 1997) articulated that bond
from a managerial perspective. Peppers and Rogers (1993) emphasized the
importance of building relationships with a one-to-one mentality. They dis-
cussed critical relationship concepts such as &ldquo;share of customer&rdquo;, &ldquo;customer</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 Creating and Enhancing Customer Relationships 27
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.7 Brand relationship management model.
</p>
<p>driven,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lifetime value.&rdquo; Peppers and Rogers (1997) emphasize that
the way to manage these relationship concepts is through data. They state
(p. 11), &ldquo;the computer is now changing the actual character of the compet-
itive model itself, supplanting it with a customer-driven model.&rdquo; The mar-
keting mantra is now, &ldquo;I know you. You tell me what you want. I make it. I
remember next time.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Nebel and Blattberg (1999) developed the concept of Brand Relation-
ship Management defined by them as, &ldquo;An integrated effort to establish,
maintain, and enhance relationships between a brand and its consumers,
and to continuously strengthen these relationships through interactive,
individualized and value-added contacts, and a mutual exchange and
fulfillment of promises over a long period of time.&rdquo; Rather than concentrate
on share of requirements (market share among the brand&rsquo;s customers) as
the ultimate goal, they suggest that the end-state of brand relationship
management is loyalty developed through affinity and the creation of a brand
relationship. An example is Apple Computer who has created numerous
customer interactions through their IPOD and Itunes and Apple Stores.
These help build a brand relationship rather than simply a brand. The goal
of a strong brand relationship is loyalty and recommendation of the product
or service. Their framework is shown in Fig. 2.7.
</p>
<p>Another example of brand relationship management is P&amp;G&rsquo;s mother
helpline. For a brand like Pampers (diaper) P&amp;G provides an interactive
helpline and website to answer mother&rsquo;s questions. Even if these questions
are not directly related to diapers, this creates interactive, individualized,
value-added contacts and hence a stronger brand relationship. The issues for
academics are: (a) do these contacts strengthen brand loyalty and (b) does
the enhanced loyalty create a brand relationship that leads to greater lifetime
value.
</p>
<p>Winer (2001) further strengthened the link between customer relation-
ships and database marketing with his &ldquo;framework for customer relationship</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>management.&rdquo; This is a framework for implementing customer relationship
management. The framework inter-twines data, data analysis, and relation-
ship building, and consists of the following steps:
</p>
<p>1. Creating a customer database
2. Analyzing the data
3. Selecting customers to target
4. Targeting customers with the appropriate vehicle
5. Developing relationship programs &ndash; reward programs, customized product,
</p>
<p>customer service, community building
6. Privacy considerations
7. Developing metrics to evaluate the process
</p>
<p>Steps 5&ndash;6 involve the harnessing of database marketing specifically to develop
relationships.
</p>
<p>2.2.3 Evidence for the Argument that Database
Marketing Enhances Customer Relationships
</p>
<p>The evidence that database marketing exists to build customer relationships
is not very strong. The issue is clouded by the faddish nature of &ldquo;CRM&rdquo; as
the latest answer to company problems. CRM has indeed received less than
favorable reviews from the business press. Most of this comes from company
surveys of manager satisfaction with CRM initiatives.
</p>
<p>&bull; Insight Technology reported that 31% of companies believed they obtained
no return on CRM, 38% got minor gains (Anonymous 2001).
</p>
<p>&bull; Gartner Group reported that 45% of CRM projects fail to improve
customer interactions and 51% generate no positive returns in 3 years
(Anonymous 2001).
</p>
<p>&bull; Meta Group reports that 75% of CRM initiatives fail to meet objectives
(Anonymous 2001).
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;It is estimated that 60&ndash;80% of CRM projects do not achieve their goals,
and 30&ndash;50% fail outright&rdquo; (Sheth and Sisodia 2001).
</p>
<p>&bull; Mercer Management Consulting found that only 38% of companies are
realizing expected returns from CRM tools, 26% are realizing expected
returns from customer profitability tools (Jusko 2001).
</p>
<p>These surveys do not pinpoint the source of the disappointment with CRM
initiatives. It is not clear whether CRM initiatives have failed, or whether they
are serving as a scapegoat for poor technological investments. In addition,
the examples are from a particular time period &ndash; the &ldquo;dot-com boom&rdquo; &ndash;
when companies had been over-investing in information technology. In any
case, there are several possibilities as to why these initial efforts to integrate
database marketing and customer relationship management may not have
been successful:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 Creating and Enhancing Customer Relationships 29
</p>
<p>&bull; Organizational Barriers: Database marketing-based CRM requires orga-
nizational coordination. Companies have not been able to achieve this.
Marketing quarrels with sales over who owns the customer (Boehm 2001).
Marketing and finance quarrel about how deeply to go down the priori-
tized customer file in investing in the relationship. Marketing and IT do
not share insights from the data mining (Gillet 1999). Management re-
ward structures are too short term to encourage cultivating the customer.
Peppers and Rogers (1997) argue that organization structures and com-
pensation schemes must adapt to the customer-centric revolution. Srini-
vasan and Moorman (2002) show that a customer-focused reward system
and strong interactions between marketing and IT encourage appropriate
investment decisions that in turn breed customer satisfaction and better
corporate performance. Reinartz et al. (2004) show that rewarding employ-
ees for cultivating relationships enhances the effectiveness of CRM efforts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition versus Retention Costs: While part of the attraction of CRM
is the view that it is cheaper to increase retention than to increase
acquisition, it this assumption may be incorrect. For example, part of
the CRM strategy is to develop a &ldquo;single view of the customer&rdquo;. This
enables the firm to manage the customer as an entity, rather than focus
on individual products. However, this may be very expensive to achieve.
Gormley (1999) reports that 92% of companies think the single view of
the customer is important, but 88% either &ldquo;not really&rdquo; or &ldquo;not at all&rdquo;
have it today. So it may be that the IT costs associated with compiling
the data needed to manage the customer are formidable.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cultivating the Customer Side of Customer Relationship Management :
Fournier et al. (1998) argue that companies simply have not deliv-
ered reciprocal benefits that are a cornerstone of customer relationships
(Fournier 1998). Companies make unrealistic demands on customers. They
charge loyal customers higher prices rather than lower prices. They appear
pre-occupied with their very best customers and under-occupied with
their average customer. One of the supposed benefits of CRM is being able
to identify best customers and focus on them (Peppers and Rogers 1993;
Zeithaml et al. 2001). While this may be appropriate, it does not mean
that average customers should be abandoned or relegated to automatic
call-handling systems. Malthouse and Blattberg (2005) show that many of
the future best customers come from customers who are currently average.
</p>
<p>&bull; Relying on Technology to Solve What Essentially is An Issue of Corporate
Culture: The view of CRM as a database marketing activity is that
databases are a tool for economies of scale. They allow large firms to know
customers in the way that the corner drugstore used to know its customers
(Swift 2001). However, this is only half the equation. The other part is
that the proprietor of the corner drugstore truly cared about his/her cus-
tomers. CRM is more than having the memory and database knowledge of
consumer needs and wants. It requires a corporate culture oriented toward
caring for individuals than the task-oriented corporate cultures that are</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>30 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>amenable to information technology (see Deshpandé et al. 1993). These
points have been raised by Sheth and Sisodia (2001) as well as Day (2000).
</p>
<p>&bull; Companies Have Not Been Able to Balance Customer-Centricity and
Product-Centricity : CRM exhorts firms to become customer centric, that
is, view their business as customer management rather than product
management. Companies have perhaps come up against the financial
problems in creating a single view of the customer, the organizational
conflicts between CRM and product management and other groups, and
the realization that their culture does not focus on the customer, and
declared CRM to be a failure. Perhaps the answer is to view the solution
along a continuum, from fully customer-centric to fully product-centric,
and management&rsquo;s task is to find the right balance.
</p>
<p>While the above paints a dim picture of database marketing as the basis
for CRM, the Conference Board (Bodenberg 2001) sampled 96 marketing
and sales executives, representing a cross-section of companies in terms of
manufacturing versus service, revenues, B2B versus B2C, and size of cus-
tomer base. Eighty percent of respondents reported their CRM efforts either
somewhat or very successful. Companies who report very successful efforts are
more likely to warehouse their own data. This suggests a strong commitment
to CRM. The report finds that the factors that often lead to CRM success
are: corporate culture and leadership, process and technology improvement,
direct communications with the customer, and budgetary and cost savings.
There are also anecdotal testimonies to the success of CRM programs. These
include companies such as Harrah&rsquo;s Entertainment (Maselli 2002; Swift 2001)
and several others.
</p>
<p>Two important empirical studies connect database marketing, customer
relationships, and firm performance. Zahay and Griffin (2004) surveyed 209
software and insurance managers. They measured: (1) personalization and
customization, i.e., using data to create individual-level products and com-
munications, (2) customer information system (CIS) development, i.e., the
degree to which the firm can generate, remember, disseminate, and interpret
customer data, (3) customer performance, i.e., retention, LTV, and share-of-
wallet, and (4) business performance, i.e., self-reported growth and income.
The authors found that personalization and customization (i.e., the practice
of database marketing), related positively to the development of the CIS,
which in turn related positively to customer performance, which in turn re-
lated positively to firm performance (p. 186, fig. 2.5). In summary, database
marketing (developing a CIS and using it for personalization and customiza-
tion), relationship development (customer performance), and business per-
formance go together.
</p>
<p>Reinartz et al. (2004) surveyed 211 executives to study the relationship
between CRM activities and firm performance. CRM activities consisted
of efforts to initiate, maintain, and terminate customer relationships. They
used several self-report scale items to measure these constructs. Items in-
cluded &ldquo;We use data from external sources for identifying potential high value</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.2 Creating and Enhancing Customer Relationships 31
</p>
<p>customers&rdquo; (initiation), &ldquo;We continuously track customer information in or-
der to assess customer value&rdquo; (maintenance), &ldquo;We have formalized procedures
for cross-selling&rdquo; (maintenance), and &ldquo;We have a formal system for identify-
ing nonprofitable or lower-value customers&rdquo; (termination). Performance was
measured using both self-report, and for a subset of their sample, an objec-
tive measure (return on assets). The authors found that CRM efforts were
positively associated with self-report and objective measures of performance.
They also found organizational factors could enhance this association. Specif-
ically, the degree of &ldquo;organizational alignment,&rdquo; which entailed reward sys-
tems for employees who enhance customer relationships, and organizational
capabilities to treat customers differently according to their profitability, in-
teracted positively with the impact of CRM efforts on performance.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the authors found that investment in CRM technology, which
included enhancements to the firm&rsquo;s ability to target 1-to-1 and to manage
&ldquo;real-time&rdquo; customer information, was negatively related to the perceptual
measures of performance. One interpretation of these results is that while
having a good customer database enhances performance, it is all too easy to
over-invest in sophisticated technology that does not pay out.
</p>
<p>These two studies provide an initial set of evidence relating the compilation
and utilization of customer data to customer relationships and to firm perfor-
mance. The evidence is not definitive, and there are several avenues that need
investigation. For example, Reinartz et al. (2004) do not isolate the role of
customer data, treating it as a part of CRM efforts. In addition, the negative
results for investment in CRM technology, which is often data-oriented, give
pause to the &ldquo;collect-all-possible-data&rdquo; dictum, and need further research.
The Zahay and Griffin (2004) study views CRM as the antecedent of customer
data, whereas the causality may be the reverse, i.e., CIS enables CRM, which
in turn enhances performance. In summary, future work should analyze differ-
ent models with different measures in different industries before we can fully
understand whether and under what conditions the collection and utilization
of customer data enhances customer relationships and firm performance.
</p>
<p>2.2.4 Assessment
</p>
<p>Overall, the logic for database marketing as a tool for developing customer
relationships is compelling. That retention has a bigger impact than acquisi-
tion is a mathematical truism. There is empirical work that says that strong
relationships lead to better customer satisfaction, better retention, and hence
better firm performance. One major question is: &ldquo;Do retention investments
have a higher payout than acquisition investments?&rdquo; The literature on this
question is almost non-existent. An exception is Reinartz et al. (2005) who
find: (a) under-spending is more detrimental than over-spending; and (b)
suboptimal allocation on retention has a greater effect than under-spending</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>32 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>on acquisition. However, more research is needed to understand the alloca-
tion of resources between acquisition versus retention efficiencies and costs.
Another question is whether database marketing can be used to create or
improve customer relationships. There is evidence on both sides, including
two empirical studies supporting a positive association among database mar-
keting, CRM initiatives, and firm performance. But there is a critical need
for more systematic research.
</p>
<p>2.3 Creating Sustainable Competitive Advantage
</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Basic Argument
</p>
<p>Database marketing utilizes a customer information file, which by definition
is owned by one company and not the other. The company can use its in-
formation to serve its customer better by identifying the correct services to
offer, make product recommendations, or tailor promotions more effectively
than its competition can do with this set of customers. This asymmetric in-
formation gives a company a potential sustainable competitive advantage. It
is sustainable because it would cost the competition too much to obtain the
same information &ndash; they would have to buy the company. In fact, increasingly
the value of a company is determined by the value of its customer file (Gupta
et al. 2004a).
</p>
<p>This vision is compelling. Customer databases are proprietary and their
advantage grows as the company learns from them and improves its customer
offerings even more. However, this does not consider competition. In particu-
lar, will each competitor assemble its own database and allow a &ldquo;live and let
live&rdquo; customer information environment, or will they compete more intensely
to acquire the competitor&rsquo;s customers and retain their own customers? We in-
vestigate these issues as we trace the evolution of the sustainable competitive
advantage argument.
</p>
<p>2.3.2 Evolution of the Sustainable Competitive
Advantage Argument
</p>
<p>The argument that database marketing provides a sustainable competitive
advantage has evolved in three steps. First was the emergence of &ldquo;marketing
orientation&rdquo; as a source of competitive advantage. Marketing orientation in-
volved the collection and utilization of customer information. However, cus-
tomer information was defined broadly and not specifically as the customer
information file used by database marketers. In the second step, Glazer (1991,
1999) and others sharpened the role of customer information files, and how</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.3 Creating Sustainable Competitive Advantage 33
</p>
<p>they could provide companies with a competitive edge. In the third step,
economists have developed formal models explaining how the customer in-
formation file could provide a sustainable increase in profits.
</p>
<p>2.3.2.1 Marketing Orientation
</p>
<p>Kohli and Jaworski (1990) defined marketing orientation as the &ldquo;generation&rdquo;
of customer data, its &ldquo;dissemination,&rdquo; within the organization, and the &ldquo;re-
sponsiveness&rdquo; of the organization to the information. A series of studies mea-
sured marketing orientation and related it to performance.
</p>
<p>Jaworski and Kohli (1993) conducted executive surveys using two samples,
of 145 and 136 strategic business units (SBU&rsquo;s) units respectively. (Also see
Kohli et al. 1993). They defined market orientation similar to their 1990
paper, and measured it on a 32-item scale. The scale included items related
to actions such as meeting with customers on a frequent basis, doing in-house
market research, collecting industry information, etc. There was no explicit
measurement of the use of customer information file.
</p>
<p>The authors found that market orientation had a significant positive rela-
tionship with a judgmental business performance measure. However, market
orientation had no relationship with an objective business performance
measure-dollar market share. The antecedents of marketing orientation
included top management emphasis, high interdepartmental connectedness
and low conflict, decentralized organization, and a reward system orientation
to executive compensation. This paper established that organizational
factors create an environment for developing a marketing orientation. It did
not however show that marketing orientation improves firm performance in
terms of an objective business performance measure.
</p>
<p>Moorman (1995) surveyed 92 marketing vice presidents and found that the
mere collection and transmission of information had no effect on the firm&rsquo;s
new product performance, but that &ldquo;conceptual&rdquo; and &ldquo;instrumental&rdquo; utiliza-
tion were positively related. Conceptual utilization is the indirect use of infor-
mation such as summarizing results, giving them meaning, etc. Instrumental
utilization is the direct application of the information to evaluating projects
and giving clear direction for implementation. Moorman&rsquo;s findings imply it
takes more than the simple collection and dissemination of the information
to create an advantage and the key is in making sense of the information and
actually using it to guide policy.
</p>
<p>Moorman and Rust (1999) surveyed two samples of managers, of sizes
n = 330 and n = 128. They found that market orientation related to
profitability and market performance but interestingly, not to customer rela-
tionship performance. Moorman and Rust&rsquo;s results imply that customer infor-
mation can improve performance but not necessarily create loyal customers.
It is as if the high market orientation firms use data to improve marketing
productivity, but not necessarily to nurture customer relationships.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>34 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>As described in Sect. 2.2.3, more recent work (Zahay and Griffin 2004;
Reinartz et al. 2004) has specifically linked database marketing activities
to firm performance. The information utilization constructs in these studies
relate more directly to database marketing activities, and therefore extend
the work relating marketing orientation to performance to the more specific
realm of database marketing and firm performance.
</p>
<p>Overall, the line of work linking database marketing to firm performance
is growing although not yet definitive. Early work on marketing orientation
finds some linkages, especially Moorman&rsquo;s (1995) study that it is the utiliza-
tion, not the mere collection of data, which builds competitive advantage.
This is reinforced by Zahay and Griffin (2004) as well as Reinartz et al.
(2004). More work is needed, especially relating database marketing to ob-
jective performance measures.
</p>
<p>2.3.2.2 The Customer Information File as a Firm Asset
</p>
<p>Glazer (1991, 1999) presented the conceptual link between the general no-
tion of customer information and the value of the customer information file.
Glazer (1991) speaks of three types of information-based value creation: the
information from upstream transactions with suppliers (Vs), the information
from internal operations (Vf), and the information from downstream trans-
actions with customers (Vc). Customer information is of interest to database
marketers, and contributes in three ways: increased revenues from future
transactions (e.g., through better targeting of the right products at the right
price), reduced costs (e.g., through not having to mail every offer to every
customer), and the sale of information itself (through say renting the cus-
tomer list). These facets combine to determine the extent to which value
generated by a product or service is due to customer information (Vf).
</p>
<p>Glazer (1991) discusses that where the firm stands in terms of supplier,
firm and customer information has important implications for the overall
strategy of the firm. For example, it can determine whether the firm pursues
a market share or market niche/targeting strategy. Market share strategies
are based on economies of scale, high volume, and low cost, and require high
supplier (Vs) and firm (Vf) information. High customer information tilts the
firm toward targeting strategies, where the key is product differentiation and
focus on a particular niche or target group. Glazer argues that if a firm
can achieve high values on all three components, it can pursue a flexible
manufacturing, mass customization strategy.
</p>
<p>Rust et al. (2002) take a related but somewhat different perspective.
They conceptualize the choice as between revenue expansion (focus on the
customer), and cost reduction (focus on decreasing operations and organi-
zational costs). Customer information supports the revenue expansion ap-
proach, whereas supplier and firm information supports the cost reduction</p>

<p>approach. They find that firms perform3 better when they focus on rev-
enue expansion, illustrating the importance of customer information, than
when they focus on both revenue expansion and cost reduction. So it ap-
pears that companies in practice may have trouble achieving all three types
of information-based value creation.
</p>
<p>Glazer&rsquo;s 1991 paper set the stage for his 1999 paper, where he explicitly
discusses the role of the customer information file (CIF), which is the source
of Vc. He defines &ldquo;smart markets&rdquo; as markets where the stock of customer
information changes frequently, and maintains that these markets are on the
increase. He uses the customer information file as a framework to generate
strategies for succeeding in smart markets.
</p>
<p>The CIF is organized as in Fig. 2.8 and suggests three &ldquo;generic&rdquo; strate-
gies: row management, column management, and row and column manage-
ment (&ldquo;whole file&rdquo;). We will just cover &ldquo;row&rdquo; and &ldquo;column&rdquo; strategies. A
column management strategy focuses on maximizing responses to a particu-
lar marketing program or product. This may involve tailoring the product to
the customer (mass customization) or targeting appropriate prices to various
buyers (yield management). Note that column management strategies are
&ldquo;product-centric&rdquo;. They start with a product, e.g., a credit card, and figure
out how to tailor features, interest rates, and prices or fees to individual
customers so as to maximize firm profits.
</p>
<p>In contrast, row management strategies focus on each customer and ask
what can the firm do to maximize profits from each or a particular set of
customers. The focus is on interactive marketing communications designed
to maximize the lifetime value of the customer. An example Glazer provides
(p. 64) is American Express using a relationship-billing program with its
commercial customers in which it first provides a given establishment de-
mographic analysis of its customers and then uses this information to sell
establishment advertising space in publications.
</p>
<p>Glazer echoes Moorman&rsquo;s (1995) point that in smart markets (markets
that are driven by customer information files), the ability to process
information, not the information itself, is the scarce resource. Thus, the

<p>36 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>source of competitive advantage to a firm is a combination of creating
customer information files, processing of the information and then utilizing
the information to drive superior marketing strategies.
</p>
<p>2.3.2.3 Economic Theories of Customer Information
as a Strategic Asset
</p>
<p>The marketing orientation literature provided a conceptual and empirical
basis for marketing information as a firm asset, and Glazer and others moved
that literature toward a focus on the customer information file as the source of
marketing advantage, and recent work suggests a link between customer data
and firm performance. The economic modeling literature then analyzed the
strategic implications of company&rsquo;s pursuit of competitive advantage through
management of the customer information file.
</p>
<p>There are several important phenomena we will discuss that have emerged
from these efforts, but the central theme is that they focus on the goal of price
discrimination, whereby the firms use customer information to identify and
offer higher prices to their loyal customers and lower prices to switchers.
The central question is: does an environment in which firms use customer
data to target prices increase profits? Economists have investigated how this
is influenced by competition, by the accuracy of the targeting, and by the
strategic behavior of firms as well as customers.
</p>
<p>Can Customer Information Be the Source of a Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma?
</p>
<p>Shaffer and Zhang (1995) investigated whether company profits increase
when customer preferences can be identified. Their customer behavior model
arrayed customers along a continuum of preference for either Firm 1 or Firm 2
(the well-known Hotelling framework). Customers trade off their preference
for the firm&rsquo;s product versus the price of that product to decide which firm
to choose. The authors assumed that both firms have perfect information on
customer preferences and on the relative weights customers place on prefer-
ences versus price.
</p>
<p>Shaffer and Zhang&rsquo;s set-up is somewhat based on Catalina Marketing, a
firm that targets coupons to customers based on their previous buying habits.
The buying habits can be determined based on a full customer history, or sim-
ply on the product most recently purchased at the cash register. For example,
if the customer buys Coke in a particular week, this suggests they prefer Coke.
At that exact purchase occasion, Pepsi could target a coupon to the customer
to induce a brand switch on the customer&rsquo;s next purchase occasion.
</p>
<p>The initially surprising, and from the perspective of database marketing,
dispiriting result was that in this scenario, firms engage in a &ldquo;targeting war&rdquo; in
which profits are lower with customer information than without. The problem</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.3 Creating Sustainable Competitive Advantage 37
</p>
<p>is that firms cannot practice price discrimination. They want to charge high
prices to their loyal customers but cannot do so because the competing firm
can attract these &ldquo;loyals&rdquo; with a steeply discounted coupon. As a result,
prices for loyal customers are not high enough to effect price discrimination,
and prices for switchers (customers in the middle of the Hotelling line) are
very low as these customers are relatively indifferent between firms.
</p>
<p>Shaffer and Zhang (1995) present a rather dismal view of database mar-
keting simply as a vehicle for competing more intensively. Obviously, this
does not match the real-world since more and more firms are using database
marketing. This goes to the issue of model assumptions. One of the key as-
sumptions in their model is that firms have perfect information on customer
preferences. This is rarely the case. Firms typically know only a given set of
customers (their own).
</p>
<p>Imperfect Targetability
</p>
<p>Chen et al. (2001), and Chen and Iyer (2002) both make a case that in a
more realistic world of imperfect targetability, firm profits actually increase
when they utilize customer databases. The reason is that firms are aware that
their targeting is not perfect, and this cushions price competition compared
to the targeting wars in the Shaffer and Zhang scenario. We will review these
papers in detail because they are crucial for providing the case that database
marketing can be a source of sustainable competitive advantage.
</p>
<p>Chen et al. (2001) use Narasimhan&rsquo;s (1988) consumer model, assuming
there are three types of consumers: loyal to Firm 1, loyal to Firm 2, and
switchers, which occur with probabilities γ1, γ2, and χ respectively. Loyal
customers will always buy from their preferred firm as long as its price is lower
than their reservation price, anchored at $1 in the model. Switchers will buy
the brand that is available at the lower cost to them, or will buy each brand
with probability 0.50 if prices are equal. Note that this model is different
than the Hotelling model used by Shaffer and Zhang, where customers were
positioned along a continuum in terms of preference, and all were potentially
vulnerable to low price discounts. The Chen et al. model is still realistic &ndash;
there are customers loyal to Coke, McDonalds, Fleet Bank or Fidelity, who
will continue to purchase these brands as long as their price does not become
too high. We will examine how profits change in this scenario as targetability
increases.
</p>
<p>Chen et al. conceptualize &ldquo;targetability&rdquo; as the firm&rsquo;s ability to identify
loyals and switchers. Chen et al. assume that a firm has information on its
own loyal customers and switchers, but not on its competitors&rsquo; loyals. It can
target its own loyals, but not its competitors&rsquo; loyals. Consider Fidelity In-
vestments. The assumption Chen et al. make is that Fidelity has information
on a given set of customers that they can classify as loyal to them (i.e., only
buy financial services from them), or switchers (buy sometimes from Fidelity,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>38 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>but sometimes from Merrill Lynch), but they do not have information on cus-
tomers who are loyal to Merrill Lynch. Chen et al. create a targetability index
equal to 0 if the firm&rsquo;s ability to classify is no better than random and 1 if
targeting is perfect.
</p>
<p>In their first set of analyses, the targetability index for each firm is consid-
ered exogenous. The question is how profits change depending on this index.
To answer this question, they identify three forces that depend on targetabil-
ity. First is the segmentation effect which results when firms can correctly
identify their loyals, leading to gains in profits because they can charge them
appropriately high prices. Second is the mistargeting effect, whereby firms
mis-identify switchers as loyals and hence charge them inappropriately high
prices. Third is the price competiton/share effect, where firms correctly iden-
tify switchers and charge them low prices to gain share.
</p>
<p>Chen et al.&rsquo;s first result is that a firm that has targeting ability always
attains higher profits if it competes with a firm that cannot target, and the
profit advantage increases as targetability increases. The segmentation and
price competition effects allow it to practice price discrimination without the
concern of being undercut by the mass marketer, who cannot do so effec-
tively because it does not know to whom to target. The mistargeting effect
holds down the database marketers profits, but as this effect decreases due
to better targetability, the database marketer&rsquo;s profits increase all the more.
Interestingly, while the database marketer&rsquo;s profits are always higher than
the mass marketer&rsquo;s profits, the mass marketer actually gains over its base
profits when mistargeting is high. The reason is that when mistargeting is
high, the database marketer charges overly high prices to mistargeted switch-
ers, and the mass marketer gains some of these switchers without having to
charge an excessively low price. In this way, the mass marketer can actually
be better off than they would be if they were competing with a database
marketer whose mistargeting costs are high.
</p>
<p>This result says that database marketing provides a sustainable profit
advantage if one firm practices it and another does not. However, a more
likely scenario is that both firms have the ability to target. Chen et al. show
that in this case, profits for both firms are always at least as high with im-
perfect targeting than without it, but the relationship between targetability
and profits is an inverse U-shape, as in Fig. 2.9. Firm profits are maximized
at intermediate values of targetability. At low levels of targetability, firms
cannot practice price discrimination and hence profits are low. At interme-
diate levels of targetability, the segmentation effect enables firms to price
discriminate and the mistargeting effect softens price undercutting. At high
targetability, the price competition effect becomes important because both
firms are identifying switchers, and the mistargeting benefit no longer cush-
ions prices. The situation is similar to Shaffer and Zhang (1995). This yields
lower profits.
</p>
<p>Chen et al. develop a number of additional results. First, they find that
Firm 1 has a profit advantage over Firm 2 if it has a larger number of</p>

</p>
<p>accurately identified loyal users. Database marketing can become a sustain-
able competitive advantage especially for the firm with a strong customer
base. The Chen et al. model is static in the sense that it does not consider the
impact of targeting on future loyalty, if firms can use their targeting ability to
nurture their loyal customers, which in turn can increase their ability to tar-
get (through more and better information revealed by these increasingly loyal
customers), one can see how the firm can develop a sustainable advantage.
</p>
<p>Chen et al. also consider the optimal levels that firms should invest in
database marketing. They find that firms will decrease investment in data-
base marketing if costs are high, although the firm with the larger loyal
segment will invest more. When database marketing costs are low, both will
invest in database marketing to the fullest extent possible. Keeping in mind
Fig. 2.9, this implies that firms can &ldquo;over invest&rdquo; and end up on the right side
of Fig. 2.9, where price competition becomes more intense, and the mistarget-
ing effect is not strong enough to soften price competition. Chen et al. also find
that even taking into account investment costs, if the firms have roughly the
same number of loyal customers, profits for both firms are higher with target-
ing than without. So database marketing is a &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; for the industry. If the
loyal segments are unbalanced, presumably it is the stronger firm that wins.
</p>
<p>Chen and Iyer (2002) provide a different perspective on the role of
imperfect targeting by changing the analysis in two ways. First, customers
are located on a Hotelling line, similar to Shaffer and Zhang, and no firm
commands absolute loyalty. Secondly, they provide a different definition of
targetability. Their definition of targetability is the percentage of customers
at each point on the line (preference level) who can be addressed by Firm
I (ai), where the assumption is that if the customer can be addressed, its
preferences are known. Chen et al. assume all the firm&rsquo;s customers can be
addressed, but that the firm is not sure whether the customers are loyals or</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>switchers. Chen and Iyer assume that firms can perfectly identify the prefer-
ences of all customers it can reach, but that it cannot target all customers.
</p>
<p>In Chen and Iyer&rsquo;s model, there are three main groups of consumers: Group
1 consists of customers that can be reached by Firm 1 but not by Firm 2
(a1(1&minus;a2)). Group 2 consists of customers that can be reached by Firm 2 but
not by Firm 1 (a2(1&minus;a1)). Group 3 consists of customers that can be reached
by both firms (a1a2). Firm 1 has monopoly power over Group 1, Firm 2 has
monopoly power over Group 2, and both firms will compete for Group 3. Chen
and Iyer call Group 1 and Group 2 the surplus extraction effect, because each
firm can charge a high price and still acquire its customers. This is analogous
to the segmentation effect in Chen et al. The Group 3 situation is called the
&ldquo;competitive&rdquo; effect, since firms will compete strongly for this segment. This
is analogous to the price competition effect in Chen et al.
</p>
<p>Chen and Iyer capture the mistargeting effect in Chen et al. by assuming
that Firm 1 knows what customers it can address but does not know what
customers its competition can address. This assumption appears to make
sense. Capital One knows what customers are in its database, but does not
know which are also in its competitors&rsquo; databases. More broadly, the assump-
tion means that a firm knows its own marketing efforts for the customers on
its list, but does not know the marketing efforts of other firms with these cus-
tomers. As a result of this information asymmetry, each firm faces a trade-off
in determining its prices. The firms want to price high for Groups 1 and 2,
but need to price low in order to attract Group 3. Thus there is a trade-off
between surplus extraction and price competition effects.
</p>
<p>Chen and Iyer calculate equilibrium profits assuming given levels of a1 and
a2. The profit for Firm 1 if these levels are roughly equal is:
</p>
<p>Profit1 = a1(1&minus; a2)(r &minus; t/2) +
a1(a1 + a2)t
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>[
(a2 &minus; a1)r + a1t
</p>
<p>(a1 + a2)t
</p>
<p>]2
(2.3)
</p>
<p>where t is the per-unit distance disutility incurred by customers on the
Hotelling line, and r is the reservation price for one unit of the good.
</p>
<p>The first term represents the profits from Group 1 (of size a1(1&minus; a2)) and
represents the surplus extraction effect. The second term represents the prof-
its from competing in the switching segment and represents the competitive
effect. In the case where addressability is roughly equal, both these terms are
important because Firm 1 realizes both Group 1 and Group 3 are sizable.
So it tries to compete in both. If a1 is much greater than a2, Firm 1 realizes
that Group 1 is the largest group, and does not bother to compete for Group
3 and profits just equal a1(1&minus; a2)(r &minus; t/2). Firm 2 faces a similar situation
if its addressability is much higher than Firm 1&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>One of Chen and Iyer&rsquo;s key results is that the equilibrium ratio of profits
between Firms 1 and 2 will be proportional to their investments in database
marketing. Therefore, the firm that invests more in database marketing has a
competitive advantage. The advantage of having an addressability advantage
is the ability to price high without having to worry about losing customers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.3 Creating Sustainable Competitive Advantage 41
</p>
<p>to the competitive firm (Group 3 is small). The database marketing leader is
able to practice price discrimination along the Hotelling line, unfettered by
worries about what its competitor might be doing.
</p>
<p>Chen and Iyer also show that if addressability is high for both firms, the
result is ruinous price competition for the switching segment. Both firms
realize they have no monopoly power and must compete for switchers. This
is analogous to the Chen et al. result that profits are lowest at very low or very
high levels of targetability. Chen and Iyer show that if the costs of obtaining
addressability are low, both firms will not invest in full addressability. One
will choose ai = 1 and the other will choose aj = 0.5. The reason is that
if Firm i has full addressability, Firm j realizes that to also achieve full
addressability will precipitate targeting wars for the switching segment. Firm
j is better off not investing fully in addressability. This creates a monopoly
segment for Firm i, which in turn cushions Firm i&rsquo;s prices, since it now must
trade off the surplus extraction and competition effects. Firm j makes less
money than Firm i, but is better off than if invested fully in addressability.
An important implication of this is that in the real world, where firms can
invest sequentially, there is a first-mover advantage, and the smart company
that is behind on database marketing should hold back investment to avoid
the targeting war scenario of Shaffer and Zhang (1995).
</p>
<p>Chen and Iyer explore two important assumptions regarding their analy-
sis. First, concerns the segment (1 &minus; a1)(1 &minus; a2) that is not addressable by
either firm. Their model assumes these consumers are lost to the market,
but they argue that if these customers can pay &ldquo;posted prices&rdquo; for the prod-
uct, there still is the asymmetric equilibrium when addressability is low cost.
Second, concerns the assumption that addressability is the same for all con-
sumers, regardless of preferences. The authors find that if firms can choose
addressability as a function of preference, they first will invest in being able
to address customers who have high preference for their product. This makes
sense, because then they can charge higher prices.
</p>
<p>In summary, both Chen et al. (2001) and Chen and Iyer (2002) find that
companies can obtain sustainable competitive advantages through investment
in database marketing. Firms make more money when they have database
marketing capabilities compared to when they do not. The key to this result
is that there must be some mechanism that keeps firms from targeting wars
as in Shaffer and Zhang. For Chen et al. that mechanism is that firms are
not sure if a customer in their database is loyal to their firm or a switcher.
Certainly this fits most situations. For Chen and Iyer, the mechanism is
that firms do not know if their competitors can target their customers. This
keeps firms from charging low prices because they realize that they may be
&ldquo;leaving money on the table&rdquo; by charging low prices to customers who are
not addressable by the competition. So the interesting conclusion is that an
intermediate level of database marketing capability is best because it creates
enough information to obtain the gains from targeting, but not too much as
to spark targeting wars.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>42 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>The Strategic Consumer
</p>
<p>The Chen et al. and Chen and Iyer papers assume that firms are pre-
scient. They do not have perfect targeting information, but they are aware
of what they know and do not know, and consider the short and long-term
implications of their information set. The consumer, on the other hand, is
considered to be passive. However, what happens if the consumer realizes
that the underlying goal of the firms is to practice price discrimination, and
that by revealing their preferences, they may be the subject of price dis-
crimination? In two important papers, Villas-Boas (1999, 2004) shows that
if consumers behave strategically, firms can be worse off if they can iden-
tify their customers. Villas-Boas (2004) is particularly important because
this is the monopolist case, and demonstrates that the disadvantage is not
due to a competitive targeting war as in Shaffer and Zhang. The problem
is that consumers hold out for lower prices because they realize that if they
do not reveal their preferences, firms will not be able to distinguish them
from brand switchers or customers new to the market and they will get low
prices.
</p>
<p>Chen and Zhang (2002) acknowledge this possibility but argue that the
effect will be more than counter-balanced by the &ldquo;price-for-information&rdquo; ef-
fect. The effect arises as follows. Firms want to price discriminate but need
to identify customer preferences in order to do so. In a two-period model,
they are tempted to price low in the first period because they realize some
customers are holding out for cheaper two-period prices. However, they also
realize that by pricing high, they do not attract as many customers but the
customers they attract are clearly loyal to them, and they can use this in-
formation to charge appropriately high prices in the second period. In other
words, firms charge higher prices for the information they gain about cus-
tomers that can be utilized in the long-term. This is the price-for-information
effect. Chen and Zhang show that even taking into account strategic cus-
tomers, firms can be better off with database marketing than without. They
do have to lower their first-period prices to discourage their loyals from wait-
ing, but they do not need to lower them completely because they realize
they will gain in the long run from learning about the customers they do
attract.
</p>
<p>The area of strategic consumers is a crucial one for the success of database
marketing. A very different venue where the effect shows up is a static rather
than a dynamic one. Feinberg et al. (2002) argue that customers can become
jealous of other customers who get better deals than them. They then may
refrain from purchasing from the firm according to their preferences. Essen-
tially, the customer is taking into account prices available to other consumers
to assess its likelihood of buying from the firm. This may not be seen as
strictly rational (why should what someone else gets affect your utility for a
product), but Feinberg et al. show in experiments that the jealousy effect is
real. To the extent that this jealousy effect is large, it decreases the ability</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2.3 Creating Sustainable Competitive Advantage 43
</p>
<p>of firms to price discriminate, which is the driving force behind the economic
arguments to date for database marketing.
</p>
<p>The economic models described above make a set of key assumptions which
drive their results: (1) the only strategic variable is price, (2) the purpose
of database marketing is to allow the firm to price discriminate, (3) firms
can target their loyal customers, and 4) only two firms compete. Each of
these assumptions is suspect in the real-world. These models assume the
purpose of database marketing is price discrimination. There is no empiri-
cal evidence that this is the goal of database marketing. Database market-
ing goals are far broader than simply price discrimination, as Glazer (1999)
discusses.
</p>
<p>Glazer (1999) shows that firms can compete using different (row and col-
umn) strategies, some of which are different than price. Under column strate-
gies, he provides examples, one of which is yield management (similar to
price in the economic models), but discusses mass customization as another
example. He also discusses row strategies in which firms use addressability
to develop customer interaction strategies to increase their loyalty. Economic
models (to date) do not consider customer interaction strategies to increase
loyalty as a goal of database marketing.
</p>
<p>Many firms do not have any information about their customer&rsquo;s loyalty.
All they can observe is purchase behavior (and maybe demographic informa-
tion). The assumption of all of these models is that the firm somehow knows
the loyalty level of its customers and then targets based on it. For exam-
ple, Fidelity Investments does not know if its customers have accounts with
Merrill Lynch, T. Rowe Price or Vanguard. One of the few industries which
might know its customer loyalty is credit card issuers in the USA because
they have information about the number and usage of cards through credit
bureaus. However, it is difficult to identify many other industries that know
the loyalty level of their customers.
</p>
<p>Some firms use customer behavioral data to price their best customers
lower than the competition. Vanguard offers lower fees to its Admiral cus-
tomers, determined by the size of balances they have within a given mutual
fund. The higher balance customers receive lower fees as a percentage of
money invested. This may be a form of competitive pricing but is not price
discrimination as in the models reviewed above.
</p>
<p>Firms may try to price discriminate (airlines) but can succeed because they
use another strategic variable (level of service) as the basis for customers&rsquo;
willingness to stay loyal even though they may be paying a higher price. The
database allows the firm to identify those customers to offer a better service.
</p>
<p>The assumption that only two firms compete may also pose problems.
If a new entrant cannot enter the industry because of the use of customer
databases by incumbent firms, then there is a return to database marketing.
Clearly in some industries, new entrants face an uphill battle because they
cannot target. An important research area is to identify industries in which
database marketing is an entry deterrent.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>2.3.3 Assessment
</p>
<p>The evidence to date regarding database marketing as a route to sustainable
competitive advantage is built on the following arguments:
</p>
<p>&bull; Empirical studies find some, although not overwhelming, evidence that
marketing orientation &ndash; the ability of firms to collect, process, and imple-
ment customer information &ndash; as well as undertaking database marketing
activities, is positively related to firm performance.
</p>
<p>&bull; The customer information file &ndash; the firm&rsquo;s database of its customers &ndash; is
the modern source of customer information. The file suggests two principle
strategies &ndash; customer centric (row strategies), and product centric (column
strategies). Strategic advantage is based on maintaining customer infor-
mation and developing these strategies.
</p>
<p>&bull; Economic models develop theories under which firms using pricing-oriented
column strategies can practice effective price discrimination. The main
requirement is that targeting abilities need to be &ldquo;moderately effective&rdquo;.
Too little and there are not enough benefits of targeting; too much and
firms engage in targeting wars.
</p>
<p>The arguments are interesting but more is needed to make establish that
database marketing is a long-term source of competitive advantage. The mar-
keting orientation studies provide some empirical evidence, but they refer to
customer information in general and not to database marketing per se. Zahay
and Griffin (2004) and Reinartz et al. (2004) provide important evidence that
database marketing itself &ndash; using the customer information file &ndash; can be asso-
ciated with better performance. However, the performance measures in sev-
eral of these studies are self-report. More studies with objective performance
measures are needed. The conceptual arguments regarding the customer in-
formation file and row (customer-centric) versus column (product-centric)
strategies are well-taken, but have not undergone empirical testing. Do row
strategies really increase loyalty? Can they be implemented inexpensively
enough to increase profits?
</p>
<p>The economic models provide logic and some insights, but they have not
been tested empirically. Empirical research along the lines of the marketing
orientation literature is needed, with the focus on targetability through cus-
tomer information, not customer information in general. In terms of column
strategies, more work is needed to understand whether prices for loyal cus-
tomers should be higher (price discrimination) or lower (pay the customer
for their loyalty) (see Shaffer and Zhang 2000), or to keep the loyal customer
from getting jealous as in Feinberg et al. (2002).
</p>
<p>The theory also needs to be extended to non-price column strategies, e.g.,
cross-selling, and to row strategies, i.e., long-term management of customer
value. The extension to non-price column strategies would be particularly
interesting. Managers would certainly like to think that customer databases
enable them to serve customers better by targeting appropriate services from</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>their product line, or by tailoring their product line to the customer. It might
be that this type of targeting is more sustainable because it is more difficult
for a competitor to understand the details of a customer&rsquo;s preferences for vari-
ous product attributes than it is to understand price response. Row strategies
might also be a source of more sustainable advantage, because long-term re-
lationships may create switching costs that bind the customer to the firm.
This leads to the existence of database marketing as a tool for enhancing
customer relationships.
</p>
<p>2.4 Summary
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we have proposed and reviewed three fundamental reasons
for companies to practice database marketing: enhancing marketing produc-
tivity, enabling the enhancement of customer relationships, and establishing
a sustainable competitive advantage.
</p>
<p>The marketing productivity argument is based on the use of data and data
mining tools to prioritize and target customers with appropriate products,
services, and prices. There is good evidence that this can work. Data mining
indeed can produce &ldquo;lift charts&rdquo; for predicting customer behavior that are
much better than random, and therefore can identify the customers for whom
marketing efforts would be wasted.
</p>
<p>The enhancing relationship argument is based on the notion that enhanced
customer relationships improve firm performance, and database marketing
can enhance relationships. The first part of the equation is well-supported
by the importance of customer retention in lifetime customer value, and em-
pirical studies that link customer relationships, customer satisfaction, cus-
tomer retention/loyalty, and firm performance. Regarding the second part
of the equation, there is a host of articles in the managerial literature that
raise questions about whether CRM investments lead to improved financial
performance. However, systematic empirical studies are beginning to find
that indeed these investments can pay off.
</p>
<p>The competitive advantage argument is based on the notion that the cus-
tomer data file is a company resource that is impossible for companies to
duplicate, that the data enable firms to service customers better than com-
petitors, and that the better-than-random yet imperfect nature of predictions
that come from the model cushions price competition. This area has received
the least empirical study although the concept is compelling.
</p>
<p>There is significant academic research pertaining to the fundamental rea-
sons firms should use database marketing but there is much more to do.
Regarding the productivity argument, we need more field tests that show
predictive models work, that they generate incremental profits beyond chan-
nel cannibalization and beyond what could be generated by simple manage-
ment heuristics. Regarding the sustainable competitive advantage argument,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>46 2 Why Database Marketing?
</p>
<p>we need survey-based research similar to the marketing orientation literature
that links database marketing, as opposed to customer information in general,
to firm profits. We need more economic theory on non-price targeting, high
versus low prices for loyals, and the strategic consumer. We need empirical
tests of the economic models, particularly the role of imperfect targeting.
</p>
<p>Regarding the enhancing CRM argument, we need to establish the link
from database marketing to enhanced relationships to satisfaction to reten-
tion to performance. The last four links have been investigated; the crucial
link is that database marketing enhances relationships. We also need to in-
vestigate the cost side of database marketing, and in particular, whether ac-
quisition costs are truly higher than marginal retention costs. More generally,
we need to investigate if and under what conditions retention management
is more cost-effective than customer acquisition strategies.</p>

</p>
<p>Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>Abstract Quantitative analysis is endemic to database marketing, but these
analyses and their implementation are not conducted in an organizational
vacuum. In this chapter, we discuss how companies organize to implement
database marketing. The key concept is the &ldquo;customer-centric&rdquo; organization,
whereby the organization is structured &ldquo;around&rdquo; the customer. We discuss
key ingredients of a customer-centric organizational structure: customer man-
agement and knowledge management. We also discuss types of database mar-
keting strategies that precede organizational structure, as well as employee
compensation and incentive issues.
</p>
<p>3.1 The Customer-Centric Organization
</p>
<p>Successful implementation of database marketing certainly requires mas-
tery of data management and modeling methodology. However, these tools
are not applied in an organizational vacuum. In this chapter we discuss
how to design organizations for implementing database marketing success-
fully.
</p>
<p>A key concept to emerge in this context is that of the &ldquo;customer-centric&rdquo;
organization. This means that the organization is structured &ldquo;around&rdquo; the
customer &ndash; from the customer in, rather than from the product out. In
the words of industry expert David Siegel as quoted by Stauffer (2001), &ldquo;If
you really care about customers . . . then you have to reorganize your entire
company around customers.&rdquo; Stauffer then says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not organizing the com-
pany to serve customers. It&rsquo;s letting customers determine how you organize.&rdquo;
Galbraith (2005, p. 6), states customer-centricity as an imperative: &ldquo;The need
for customer-centricity is not going away, and it is up to each company to
determine the level of application . . . required for success.&rdquo;

<p>Fig. 3.1 Star model of the customer-centric organization (From Galbraith 2005).
&lowast; These concepts are used by Langerak and Verhoef (2003).
</p>
<p>We will frame our discussion using the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; model developed by
Galbraith (2002, 2005). The Star model emphasizes five ingredients for suc-
cessful organizational design: strategy, structure, processes, rewards, and
people (Galbraith 2005, p. 15). Strategy refers to the goals of the organization
and the means by which it intends to achieve them. Structure refers to
the organizational chart &ndash; what departments and positions need to be cre-
ated, and how will they interact. Processes refer to the means by which
information flows within the organization. Rewards refer to the compen-
sation and incentives that ensure the employees of the organization per-
form effectively. People refers to the policies that ensure that employ-
ees have the right skills and &ldquo;mind-set&rdquo; to implement the organizational
design.
</p>
<p>Figure 3.1 shows the Star model applied to designing the customer-centric
organization. Listed under each of the five components of the framework are
the key issues that will be discussed in the following sections.
</p>
<p>3.2 Database Marketing Strategy
</p>
<p>The organization design for implementing database marketing emerges from
the firm&rsquo;s database marketing strategy. The key issues are: (1) What is that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.2 Database Marketing Strategy 49
</p>
<p>strategy, and (2) How will the organizational design establish a competitive
advantage?
</p>
<p>3.2.1 Strategies for Implementing DBM
</p>
<p>3.2.1.1 The Langerak/Verhoef Taxonomy
</p>
<p>Langerak and Verhoef (2003) distinguish three types of CRM strate-
gies: Customer Intimacy, Operational Efficiency, and Marketing Efficiency.
Customer Intimacy means that the company&rsquo;s strategy truly is to de-
liver personal service to its customers, to know them on an intimate base
and customize its products, services, and communications to them. Opera-
tional Efficiency employs CRM to reduce costs and utilize non-marketing
resources efficiently. Marketing Efficiency uses customer data to improve
marketing productivity, i.e., making marketing more effective at achieving
less churn, more successful cross-selling, and in general, greater customer
profitability.
</p>
<p>Langerak and Verhoef argue that organization design should follow from
which of the three strategies the company pursues. For example, they study
a private investment banking firm whose strategy was Customer Intimacy,
but the company approach to customer service was actually quite imper-
sonal. The firm realized it needed to develop personal, intimate relationships
with its customers. They grouped their customers into three need segments
(&ldquo;self-made man,&rdquo; &ldquo;strategy maker,&rdquo; and &ldquo;security seeker&rdquo;) and assigned a
customer management team to each group. They created an organizational
structure that best implemented their strategy.
</p>
<p>Langerak and Verhoef also studied an insurance company that competed
on operational excellence, i.e., &ldquo;price, convenience, and speed.&rdquo; This meant
that the company needed to keep operations costs as low as possible, and
develop ways of interacting with customers that were as fast and efficient
as possible. This strategy required a highly transactional relationship with
customers. The company adopted an organizational structure based funda-
mentally on data management. The data management group fed information
to the rest of the organization to help it be more efficient. It especially sup-
ported the firm&rsquo;s efforts on the Internet channel, where products could be
personalized at low cost.
</p>
<p>Finally, Langerak and Verhoef studied a holiday resort company whose
marketing efforts were highly inefficient. They provided mass-mailing offers
with very low response rates. They needed CRM to improve marketing ef-
ficiency. Accordingly, they set up a CRM department that focused on data
mining, database management, and integrating database marketing and cus-
tomer contact efforts. The system was in place only to increase the produc-
tivity of their marketing efforts.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>50 3 Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>The main point is that the three generic CRM strategies identified by
Langerak and Verhoef each require different organizational designs and dif-
ferent levels of customer-centricity.
</p>
<p>3.2.1.2 Galbraith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Strategy Locator&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Galbraith (2005, pp. 32&ndash;33) also proposes that the desired degree of customer-
centricity depends on the strategy of the company. He develops a &ldquo;Strategy
Locator&rdquo;, a measurement scale consisting of two dimensions: Scale and Scope,
and Integration. Scale and Scope refers to the number and variety of products
marketed by the company. Integration refers to the degree that the company&rsquo;s
products must be packaged or bundled together to deliver satisfaction to the
customer. According to Galbraith, the higher the company scores on this
scale, i.e., the degree to which the company offers many varied products
that must be integrated, determines the degree to which the firm must be
customer-centric.
</p>
<p>Galbraith describes a chemical company that only required &ldquo;light-level&rdquo;
customer-centricity. The company had relatively few products that did not
need to be integrated. It therefore rated low on the strategy locator. The
organizational design did include some elements of customer-centricity &ndash; e.g.,
customer management teams &ndash; although the formal organizational structure
centered on functions and geographic areas.
</p>
<p>Galbraith then describes an investment bank that required a &ldquo;medium-
level&rdquo; degree of customer-centricity. This company had a moderate number
of banking products that required integration. It therefore rated medium on
the strategy locator. The organizational design included not only customer
managers, but formal processes to ensure that customer contacts were co-
ordinated within the customer management team. Formal reward structures
based on customer performance were implemented, and formal CRM training
programs were put in place.
</p>
<p>Galbraith uses IBM as an example of requiring a &ldquo;complete-level&rdquo; de-
gree of customer-centricity. IBM has several different products, requiring
a high degree of integration. IBM therefore rates high on the strategy lo-
cator. IBM&rsquo;s strategy focused on delivering customer &ldquo;solutions&rdquo;, a highly
customer-centric idea. The notion was to solve the customer&rsquo;s problem,
whatever products and services were required. Given the complexity of
problems, this required very high coordination among IBM management.
IBM now has a solutions-oriented structure where Product managers work
with the customer to deliver the right combination of IBM products and
services to solve the customer&rsquo;s problem. Its processes help ensure that
customer plans and priorities are shared easily among the relevant man-
agers involved with the customer. The company still uses quotas to re-
ward salespeople, a product-centric approach, but also formally assesses</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.2 Database Marketing Strategy 51
</p>
<p>the &ldquo;competencies&rdquo; of its employees to make sure they match customer
needs.
</p>
<p>3.2.2 Generating a Competitive Advantage
</p>
<p>Firms are constantly trying to establish a competitive advantage &ndash; a core
competence that gives them a sustainable edge over its competition. One
possibility is that the organizational design through which the company im-
plements database marketing might be a source of competitive advantage.
</p>
<p>Peteraf (1993), articulating the &ldquo;resource-based view of the firm,&rdquo; defines
four factors that determine whether a company&rsquo;s competences will translate
into competitive advantage: heterogeneity, ex-post limits to competition, im-
perfect mobility, and ex-ante limits to competition.1 Heterogeneity means
that firms within the industry have different competencies. For example, one
firm may develop a marketing analytics group that is different, and better,
than the groups at other companies. Ex-post limits mean that the company&rsquo;s
capabilities are difficult to replicate. For example, competitors may know
which software package the firm uses for cross-selling, but because the firm
has an organizational structure that emphasizes customer management, it
knows its customers so well that no other firm can duplicate its success.
Imperfect mobility means that the resources that give the firm its compet-
itive advantage cannot be obtained by another firm. Competitors often try
to hire away a firm&rsquo;s best managers. However, a customer manager might be
effective because the scale of the firm permits frequent interaction with the
marketing analytics group. So a firm cannot simply hire this manager away
and expect the same success. Ex-ante limits refer to first-mover advantage.
For example, a company that first uses CRM for operational efficiency may
be &ldquo;ahead of the curve&rdquo; in terms of the organizational structure that best
supports this strategy.
</p>
<p>3.2.3 Summary
</p>
<p>Strategy plays a pivotal role in determining the organizational structure
for implementing database marketing. While &ldquo;customer-centricity&rdquo; has come
into fashion, Langerak and Verhoef (2003) as well as Galbraith (2005) ar-
gue that not all organizations need to adopt the same degree of customer-
centricity. Another major theme is that the goal is to wed the firm&rsquo;s database
marketing strategy with an organizational design that creates a competitive
advantage for the firm.

<p>3.3 Customer Management: The Structural Foundation
of the Customer-Centric Organization
</p>
<p>3.3.1 What Is Customer Management?
</p>
<p>The customer management organization structure has been articulated by
Peppers and Rogers (1993, pp. 175&ndash;206). Their idea is that the marketing
efforts of the firm should be organized by customer groups or &ldquo;portfolios&rdquo;,
each portfolio managed by a customer manager. This is in stark contrast
to the product management structure. Figure 3.2 illustrates. In the product
management structure (Fig. 3.2a), product managers run their products as
profit centers. They are responsible for generating sales and profits. They
rely on the traditional &ldquo;Four P&rsquo;s&rdquo; (product, price, distribution, and promo-
tion), draw on services provided by advertising and promotion departments,
and work closely with production managers on product improvements and
quality.
</p>
<p>The customer management framework (Fig. 3.2b) clusters the firm&rsquo;s cus-
tomers into portfolios. One possible clustering is by sales level &ndash; heavy,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.3 Customer Management 53
</p>
<p>medium, and light user customer portfolios. Each customer would be as-
signed to one and only one portfolio. Each portfolio would be managed by
a customer manager. The customer manager would draw support from ad-
vertising and promotion departments, and from &ldquo;capabilities managers,&rdquo; the
former product managers who would now be responsible for making sure the
products performed up to the standards needed to serve customers. Customer
managers would work with product managers on quality issues as well as new
product features and other product development tasks.
</p>
<p>The customer manager&rsquo;s goal is to increase the lifetime value of the cus-
tomers in his or her portfolio. This emphasizes the long-term orientation of
the customer manager. Peppers and Rogers define the customer manager&rsquo;s
job as follows (1997, pp. 356&ndash;357): &ldquo;. . . someone must be assigned the re-
sponsibility for managing customers individually. . . . The customer manager&rsquo;s
responsibility is to manage each customer relationship, supervising the firm&rsquo;s
dialogue with each, finding products and services for each, and determining
how best to customize to meet each customer&rsquo;s individual specifications. In
short, the customer manager&rsquo;s job is to delve more and more deeply into each
individual customer&rsquo;s needs in order to lock the customer in, make the firm
more valuable to the customer, and increase the company&rsquo;s margin &ndash; with
each customer.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>3.3.2 The Motivation for Customer Management
</p>
<p>The motivation for customer management rests on three assumptions: (1)
Stronger customer relationships yield higher sales and profits. (2) The
product management system is not effective at developing customer rela-
tionships. (3) The customer management system is effective at developing
customer relationships.
</p>
<p>The premise for the first assumption is that the customer is more powerful
today than ever before. In a B2C context, customers in industries ranging
from financial services to telecom to travel to retail face an ever-expanding
array of choices and they make choices with more information (due to the
Internet). In B2B industries, companies ranging from IBM to Xerox face the
same sophisticated customer. Companies like P&amp;G are becoming more like
B2B companies &ndash; their customers are Wal-Mart and the newly consolidated
supermarket companies. The assumption that better customer relationships
feed firm performance has received some empirical support (Reinartz et al.
2004; Zahay and Griffin 2004; Day and Van den Bulte 2002; Chaston et al.
2003), although more work is needed.
</p>
<p>The second assumption has not received empirical testing. The logic is that
product management maximizes sales, not customer satisfaction. Each of the
firm&rsquo;s product managers acts individually, with the result that customers
are bombarded with offers and selling pitches. The customer is &ldquo;turned off&rdquo;
by this marketing blitz, and perhaps most importantly, finds him or herself</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>54 3 Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>owning the wrong products. A good example would be financial services,
where the customer becomes over-invested in retirement products like IRAs
when he or she should be investing in college-funding instruments. In short,
the firm spends too much money on marketing, many of its efforts cannibalize
each other, and they don&rsquo;t yield better customer relationships.
</p>
<p>The third assumption, that customer management is effective for devel-
oping customer relationships, has also not been tested directly. In Sect. 3.5,
we discuss evidence that customer-oriented incentive systems produce more
satisfied customers and better marketing performance. But this does not vali-
date customer management per se. These incentives could be used for product
managers as well as customer managers.
</p>
<p>In summary, the motivation for customer management is that customer
relationships are vital, product management is antithetical to this goal, and
customer management will be successful at achieving this goal. This motiva-
tion has received some empirical support but much more evidence is needed.
</p>
<p>3.3.3 Forming Customer Portfolios
</p>
<p>A major challenge is how to define customer portfolios. Peppers and Rogers
advocate that firms define portfolios based on customer needs. This allows
the customer manager to specialize in serving the needs relevant to these
customers. There are many ways to actualize this idea. One method is to
group customers by volume. This is consistent with customer tier manage-
ment (Chapter 23). An airline for example may have customer managers for
its premium tier customers. While customer volume is a natural grouping
scheme, there are many others. A financial services company may group
customers by life-stage, e.g., young professionals, families, and retirees. A
software company may group customers by line-of-business, e.g., education
versus business, or by industry. In fact, a major challenge in customer man-
agement is to decide exactly how to form the customer portfolios, and how
many portfolios should be defined. This is very much the perennial marketing
issue of how a market should be segmented.
</p>
<p>One challenge in defining customer portfolios is customer movement be-
tween portfolios. For example, the financial services customer manager for
young professionals should be concerned with passing along good customers
to the customer manager for young families. The customer manager for low-
volume customers should be concerned with turning them into high value
customers. The compensation system becomes key &ndash; it should be based not
only the current profitability of the customer portfolio, but also on how many
customers the customer manager converts to high volume customers, or the
number and quality of young professionals the customer manager passes along
to the young family customer manager. Referring back to the Star model
(Fig. 3.1), this is an example where structure (the customer management
system) interacts with compensation.</p>

<p>3.3 Customer Management 55
</p>
<p>3.3.4 Is Customer Management the Wave
of the Future?
</p>
<p>To flesh out the key issues for firms deciding whether to pursue customer
management organizational structures, in this section we discuss the pros
and cons from an advocacy viewpoint.
</p>
<p>3.3.4.1 Why Customer Management Is Inevitable
</p>
<p>Customer management is inevitable and the firms that move first toward this
system will achieve the highest rewards. The reasons for this are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer satisfaction is the key to success and customer management will
produce higher customer satisfaction than product management. Customer
management is truly focused on serving customer needs, whereas the prod-
uct manager&rsquo;s goal is to sell product.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer management creates sustainable advantage. Customer manage-
ment encourages each company to know the needs of its customers better,
and it is difficult for other firms to replicate this knowledge.
</p>
<p>&bull; Product management is inherently short-term. This is because it empha-
sizes current profits for one product. Customer managers are concerned
with lifetime value of the customer, which is inherently long-term.
</p>
<p>&bull; Modern Information technology enables customer management. Until re-
cently, firms did not have the data management systems nor the statis-
tical tools required to pursue customer management activities such as
cross-selling, lifetime value management, churn management, etc. These
systems and tools are now in place.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer management may be revolutionary but it can be implemented
in an evolutionary fashion. For example, MacDonald (2001) reports that
Nike Canada assigns &ldquo;consumer champions&rdquo; to specific customer groups.
Customer champions do not have line responsibility as prescribed by a
complete customer management structure, but they can change the con-
versation from &ldquo;let&rsquo;s sell more basketball shoes&rdquo; to &ldquo;let&rsquo;s increases sales
to teenage boys&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>3.3.4.2 Why Customer Management Would Not Work
</p>
<p>There are just too many practical, cultural, and structural reasons why cus-
tomer management will be very difficult to implement. These include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Product management is deeply ingrained in corporate culture. Companies
are product/sales/short-term oriented. Wall Street demands this, and it
produces the most easily measured results. Customer management requires
too much of a change in organizational culture.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>56 3 Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer management will steer companies away from their distinctive
competencies. Most companies have distinctive competencies and cannot
deliver the best product in each category. Customer managers may urge a
financial services firm sell a mutual fund, but if this is not a high quality
fund, this will produce dissatisfied clients in the long run.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer management will create even worse conflicts than those found
among product managers. Each customer manager will want more funds
and will make competing demands on capabilities managers. For example,
managers of the teen-age customers will demand certain features for the
company credit card, while mangers of the 50+ customers will demand
other features. Who has the authority to referee the demands of the cus-
tomer managers for new product features versus the capabilities manager&rsquo;s
view that these features are too expensive?
</p>
<p>&bull; It is difficult to measure the key performance indexes for customer man-
agers. Performance indices for customer managers include share-of-wallet
(SOW) and lifetime value (LTV). But SOW is difficult to measure because
Firm A does not have data for how much business each customer does with
Firms B and C. LTV calculations require many assumptions about reten-
tion rates, etc. It&rsquo;s impossible to design a reward system based on such
fuzzy measurements.
</p>
<p>&bull; It is not practical for many companies. How can General Motors organize
around Teens, Young Families, Young Professionals, Elderly, etc? How can
General Mills organize around Families with Children, Singles, Elderly,
etc? They just don&rsquo;t have direct access to customers on that basis.
</p>
<p>&bull; Do customer managers have the expertise? A customer manager must have
the expertise to diagnose customer needs and prescribe the right products
for each customer. In many industries, the product is so technical that no
one manager can possibly understand all the products. IBM may try to
address this through a team approach, but that requires a lot of coordi-
nation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer management is expensive. It adds a new layer of managers &ndash; the
customer manager. It does not eliminate the product manager &ndash; it just
changes his or her responsibilities. The result is higher personnel costs in
salary and support.
</p>
<p>&bull; Product management takes into account customer needs anyway. Product
managers are marketers &ndash; they develop products to fit the needs of a target
group.
</p>
<p>3.3.5 Acquisition and Retention Departmentalization
</p>
<p>Until now, our focus has been on managing current customers, but what
about the management of customer acquisition? An important aspect of the
customer-centric organization is the division of efforts into acquisition and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.4 Processes for Managing Information: Knowledge Management 57
</p>
<p>retention. These are two very different functions. For example, Del Rio (2002)
describes a wireless phone company with separate departments for acquisi-
tion and retention. Publishers have traditionally employed acquisition edi-
tors, who sign up authors and books, and managing editors, who manage the
editing, production, and marketing of the books.
</p>
<p>The advantage of this departmentalization comes from the fact that acqui-
sition and retention require two different mind-sets, involve different tools,
and have different success measures. Acquisition is entrepreneurial. It is more
straightforward to measure, reward, and motivate. It is short-term. Reten-
tion management is quite different. It is difficult to measure (i.e., it relies on
lifetime value and share-of-wallet), and therefore difficult to reward. It is long
term.
</p>
<p>The disadvantage of acquisition/retention departmentalization is that the
acquisition department may not acquire the right customers. For example,
an acquisition manager might use price discounts to attract customers who
are inherently deal prone churners; impossible to retain.
</p>
<p>The key challenge therefore lies in coordination. Incentives could be used
to make sure the acquirers attract the right customers. These might entail
measures such as lifetime value. Ainslie and Pitt (1998) provide interesting
evidence that it is possible to develop models that guide acquisition efforts
according to long-term customer management goals. They model prospects
in terms of their ultimate profitability, risk, and responsiveness to future
modeling efforts. Then they prioritize customers in terms of an overall index
of these three criteria. Thus it may be possible to use predictive models to
facilitate coordination between acquisition and retention.
</p>
<p>3.4 Processes for Managing Information:
Knowledge Management
</p>
<p>3.4.1 The Concept
</p>
<p>Knowledge management is the systematic process of creating, codifying,
transferring, and using knowledge to improve business performance. Knowl-
edge management pertains to any type of knowledge generated by the
organization, but in the context of database marketing, we are concerned
with knowledge about the customer.
</p>
<p>Davenport and Prusak (1998, pp. 1&ndash;6) distinguish among data, informa-
tion, and knowledge. Knowledge management systems entail all three. Data is
the raw, stored input, unanalyzed. Information is compiled data that &ldquo;makes
a difference&rdquo; (Davenport and Prusak p. 3) in a decision. Knowledge is one
step up from information. It is a mix of &ldquo;experience, values, contextual infor-
mation, and expert insight that provides a framework for evaluating and in-
corporating new experiences and information&rdquo; (Davenport and Prusak p. 5).</p>
<p/>

<p>58 3 Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>For example, consider a cross-selling campaign for audio speakers that can
be used with a computer. Each customer&rsquo;s response can be recorded. This is
data. The data can be compiled to yield a response rate. This is information.
It can be used to calculate profitability of the campaign. The data could be
analyzed to determine that those who responded had bought a computer in
the last 3 months. The insight, or knowledge, generated is that customers
who have recently invested in computer hardware are &ldquo;ripe&rdquo; for peripherals.
This suggests a particular target group as well as copy (&ldquo;no new computer
system is complete without the best speakers . . . &rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Knowledge management draws on information technology, economics, or-
ganization behavior, human resource management, and marketing. Informa-
tion technology underlies the data warehousing issues that are crucial for
knowledge management. While we are not aware of formal economic analyses
of knowledge management, Davenport and Prusak (1998) argue that the firm
faces both an internal and external market for knowledge. There are buyers,
sellers, and prices. Organizational behavior scholars have studied knowledge
management under the label &ldquo;organizational learning&rdquo; (e.g., Argote 1999), fo-
cusing on how organizations learn, how they forget, how they remember, and
how information is shared. Human resource management views knowledge
management as a human capital issue, and is concerned with how to provide
the skills for employees to learn and share their learning (Tapp 2002, p. 110).
</p>
<p>Marketers have touched upon knowledge management in their study of
&ldquo;marketing orientation.&rdquo; In fact, Kohli and Jaworski (1990) define marketing
orientation as the generation, dissemination, and utilization of information
related to customer needs. This is very close to our definition of knowledge
management.
</p>
<p>3.4.2 Does Effective Knowledge Management
Enhance Performance?
</p>
<p>As just mentioned, the concept of marketing orientation is similar to knowl-
edge management. Therefore, the evidence of a positive relationship between
marketing orientation and firm performance (Jaworski and Kohli 1993; Moor-
man 1995; Moorman and Rust 1999) suggests knowledge management can
pay off. The caveat, however, is that these studies focused on the general
collection and utilization of customer information, and not on knowledge
gained through database marketing.
</p>
<p>Some research connects knowledge management with successful CRM.
Chaston et al. (2003) surveyed 223 UK accounting firms. They measured
knowledge management in terms of orientation toward acquiring knowledge
from external sources, exploiting new knowledge, documenting carefully, mak-
ing information available to all employees, and improving employee skills.
They thus covered the create&ndash;codify&ndash;transfer&ndash;use dimensions of knowledge
management (DiBella et al. 1996). They measured CRM orientation in terms
of maintaining close contact with clients, regularly meeting with clients,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.4 Processes for Managing Information: Knowledge Management 59
</p>
<p>gaining knowledge through building strong relationships, tailoring service to-
ward clients, and gaining revenue mainly through repeat sales. The authors
found a strong correlation between knowledge management and CRM. Firms
that were above average in CRM orientation were above average in knowledge
management. They were also above average in sales growth.
</p>
<p>Croteau and Li (2003) surveyed 57 Canadian firms with greater than 250
employees, representing a variety of industries. Knowledge management was
measured using scales such as &ldquo;able to provide fast decision-making due to
customer knowledge availability&rdquo;. The impact of CRM efforts was measured
using company self-reported satisfaction with retention rates, loyalty, market
share gains, innovative and convenient products. In a multi-equation struc-
tural model, knowledge management was found to be a significant predictor
of CRM impact.
</p>
<p>These studies suggest a connection between knowledge management and
CRM. They help justify the view that data and CRM go hand-in-hand
(O&rsquo;Neill 2001; Swift 2001). However, they do not distinguish the type of
knowledge being managed, i.e., whether it be data, information, or knowl-
edge in Davenport and Prusak&rsquo;s framework. Further research is needed to
sharpen our understanding of exactly what types of knowledge are most im-
portant for enhancing CRM efforts.
</p>
<p>One potential benefit of knowledge management is that it provides con-
tinuity as employees move to other firms. In fact, employee turnover was
arguably the prime stimulus for the emergence of knowledge management as
a field (see Tapp 2002). Knowledge management can be viewed as a way of
capturing the knowledge of current employees so if they physically leave, their
wisdom still remains. However, studies are needed to investigate whether in
fact this benefit materializes in the real world.
</p>
<p>3.4.3 Creating Knowledge
</p>
<p>The first step in the knowledge management process is creating knowledge,
which can be categorized as internal versus external, and undirected versus
directed.
</p>
<p>Internal knowledge creation takes place as part of the process of analyz-
ing data and making decisions (Davenport et al. 2001a). Gillett (1999, fig. 4)
reinforces this point. Many lessons are learned each time a modeler builds
a predictive model and a manager uses it to target. The result is a reper-
toire of experiences that creates knowledge about what works and doesn&rsquo;t
work.
</p>
<p>Knowledge can also be &ldquo;created&rdquo; externally, most obviously by hiring an-
other firm&rsquo;s employees (&ldquo;grafting&rdquo; in the words of Huber 1991). At the micro
level, grafting may be of individual employees (e.g., hiring the CRM manager
from a rival company); at the macro level, grafting can occur by purchasing
an entire company. For example, DoubleClick gained much knowledge of the
list industry by purchasing Abacus.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>60 3 Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>Directed knowledge creation takes place when a company proactively fo-
cuses on a particular topic. For example, a service company may focus on
customer satisfaction (DiBella et al. 1996). Davenport et al. (2001b) say that
successful companies focus on learning about top customers, or customers
most likely to provide future earnings. They cite FedEx and US West as ex-
amples. P&amp;G focuses on understanding Wal-Mart. Microsoft began focusing
on CIO&rsquo;s when it became clear that business customers were a prime source
of future growth.
</p>
<p>Undirected knowledge creation takes place as a &ldquo;spin-off&rdquo; benefit of the
analysis/decision process. For example, a manager may want to design a fre-
quency reward program. Upon tapping the firm&rsquo;s knowledge management
system, the manager realizes that not much is known about the topic. The
manager therefore conducts his or her own research, surveying other firms&rsquo;
programs and conducting survey research. Another form of undirected knowl-
edge creation takes place as current employees mentor new employees. The
new employee questions why something is done a certain way, and that forces
the current employee to crystallize his or her knowledge.
</p>
<p>Experiments are an effective way to create knowledge. They allow compa-
nies to test fundamental assumptions as opposed to marginal improvements
(DiBella et al. 1996). The prevalence of experimentation in database market-
ing makes it particularly prone to this type of learning.
</p>
<p>A final issue in knowledge creation is that it requires managers to have
the wherewithal and ability to interpret data and information. For example,
the most immediate use of a predictive model might be the prioritized list of
customers. However, knowledge is created when the model-builder and the
marketing manager sit down and review the important variables in the predic-
tive model. Therefore, knowledge creation requires time, training, and often
group work (Gillett 1999). Davenport et al. (2001a) report that most com-
panies are not succeeding in turning data into knowledge, and are neglecting
&ldquo;the human realm of analyzing and interpreting data and then acting on the
insights&rdquo; (p. 118). They cite their own studies as well as two prime examples,
supermarket scanner data in the grocery chain industry, and Web transaction
data. The data certainly are being created, but managers simply do not have
the time to generate information from the data, much less knowledge.
</p>
<p>One response to this is to make more knowledge creation activities di-
rected, or to require managers to record what they learned. Firms need to
foster a work environment that allows time for reflection. This is a challenge
for today&rsquo;s downsized companies.
</p>
<p>3.4.4 Codifying Knowledge
</p>
<p>Knowledge needs to be stored for two reasons. First, it enables more efficient
transfer to other employees. Second, knowledge not recorded can be forgot-
ten. Organization forgetting is a significant phenomenon (Argote 1999). It</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.4 Processes for Managing Information: Knowledge Management 61
</p>
<p>happens through employee turnover and through lack of repetition (e.g., &ldquo;we
once ran a campaign like this, but that was several years ago, and frankly, I
forgot what happened&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>The key issues in codifying knowledge are what to store and how to store
it. Knowledge should be stored to the extent that is useful and necessary
to sustain the firm&rsquo;s strategy. Obviously, companies whose strategy is to de-
velop customer relationships must store all data, information, and knowledge
related to customer relationships. However, there still may be a surfeit of
knowledge to store and decisions need to be made as to what knowledge will
truly be useful in the future.
</p>
<p>The details of how to store the knowledge are the domain of information
technology. Although expensive, it is relatively straightforward to compile
and record customer data and information; that is what CRM information
systems are designed to do. Insights, i.e., true knowledge, can be tougher to
codify. This can be done by requiring key employees to write white papers.
Expert systems are another possibility, as are knowledge maps (Davenport
and Prusak 1998; Vail 1999).
</p>
<p>Davenport et al. (2001b) emphasize the need to store both quantitative and
qualitative data, and cite P&amp;G as a company that tries to do both through
either face-to-face meetings or &ldquo;discussion databases&rdquo; (p. 65). Sometimes,
however, it will be very difficult to codify what is learned. Harley-Davidson
and the Jeep division of DaimlerChrysler rely on ethnographic research to
understand their customers. Consultants conduct the research, and commu-
nicate what they learn through discussions with managers, but this does not
formally codify it.
</p>
<p>Another issue is whether there should be one knowledge repository (the
&ldquo;enterprise warehouse&rdquo;) or several. Assuming cost is not an issue, the obvious
preference is for one repository. This facilitates cross-referencing and equal
access. However, perhaps due to costs, Davenport et al. (2001b) report that
most firms do not store all their knowledge in one place. They cite Dell, who
at the time of their paper, had not integrated their online data with data
from the calling center.
</p>
<p>Finally, knowledge is not only of the facts, but also of processes. It is
perhaps even more important to codify processes. Davenport et al. (2001b)
discuss Kraft&rsquo;s &ldquo;3-Step Category Builder,&rdquo; a process for analyzing a product
category and deciding how it can be grown.
</p>
<p>3.4.5 Transferring Knowledge
</p>
<p>There can be both formal and informal mechanisms to transfer knowledge
to the appropriate people. The most common formal mechanism, especially
for transferring data and information, is to train managers to access cus-
tomer information housed in the data warehouse. Information also can be</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>62 3 Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>transferred automatically, e.g., a customer profile can appear on the screen
when a catalog company representative is talking with the customer. Other
formal forms of knowledge transfer are through in-house seminars and white
papers.
</p>
<p>Informal knowledge sharing is perhaps the most difficult to orchestrate. It
involves installing a culture and a physical environment to facilitate conver-
sation. For example, it would be a good idea to locate the model builders
adjacent to the managers who make decisions based on the models, and
to encourage mentoring whereby senior managers transfer their experiential
knowledge to junior managers.
</p>
<p>Huber (1991) summarizes the vast research from the organization behavior
literature that describes the circumstances under which knowledge sharing
will occur. Informant A may have to knowledge to transfer to Recipient B.
Transfer is more likely if A views the information as relevant for B, A&rsquo;s costs
of sharing are low, A&rsquo;s workload is low, A has incentives for sharing, and B
has high power/status in the organization.
</p>
<p>3.4.6 Using Knowledge
</p>
<p>Using knowledge is probably the most critical component of the knowledge
management system. What good is the knowledge if it&rsquo;s never used? If the
first three steps &ndash; creation, codification, and transference &ndash; have been achieved
correctly, usage should follow, because this means that insightful, relevant
knowledge has been created, it&rsquo;s available in &ldquo;the system&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s easy for
the manager to tap this knowledge base.
</p>
<p>Consumer behavior researchers have established that individuals will use
information to the extent that it is accessible and diagnostic (Feldman et
al. 1988). Accessibility follows to the extent that the knowledge information
system makes knowledge easily available, i.e., that knowledge transference is
effective. Diagnosticity follows to the extent that the information is useful.
Designers of knowledge management systems need to make sure that both
these conditions hold. For example, in a study of a US health insurance com-
pany, Payton and Zahay (2003) found that &ldquo;ease of use&rdquo;, i.e., accessibility,
and &ldquo;quality&rdquo; of the data, i.e., diagnosticity, were the two key factors de-
termining employee use of the corporate data warehouse. Top management
support and training were also important factors.
</p>
<p>The diagnosticity of information is difficult to judge, because it is sub-
jective to establish whether the knowledge is truly useful. For example, a
company&rsquo;s knowledge management system may contain information that says
recent purchasers of computers are prime candidates for cross-selling external
speakers. However, a new manager may believe these insights are not useful
in today&rsquo;s marketing environment. The new manager may be of the opinion
that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to cross-sell external speakers to someone who has</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.4 Processes for Managing Information: Knowledge Management 63
</p>
<p>recently bought a computer system, because either the speakers would have
been included in the purchase or if the customer wanted the speakers, he or
she would have bought them then and there.
</p>
<p>The difficulty is that the new manager might indeed be correct and the
knowledge may not apply to today&rsquo;s marketing environment. It doesn&rsquo;t make
sense to require the new manager to use the information. Perhaps the best
tack is to make the information easily accessible, but allowing the new man-
ager to make judgments as to whether the information is useful.
</p>
<p>3.4.7 Designing a Knowledge Management System
</p>
<p>Figure 3.3 suggests a process for designing a knowledge management system.
The first step is to make sure the pre-requisites (the company&rsquo;s database
marketing strategy, information technology infrastructure, skills, and organi-
zational culture) are in place, (Davenport et al. 2001a). The strategy guides
which knowledge gets created and stored. The information technology struc-
ture is essential because it defines the capability for housing the customer
data as well as other forms of codified knowledge. Croteau and Li (2003), in
their study of Canadian firms, found that technological &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; was an
important precursor of successful knowledge management efforts. Employees
need to have the skills to create, codify, transfer, and use knowledge. There
needs to be an organizational culture that values knowledge.
</p>
<p>The next phase is to design the core of the system: the content, creation
activities, codification procedures, transference techniques, and usage mech-
anisms. Content decisions involve the topics and depth of knowledge that
will be part of the system. Topics follow from the strategy and includes as-
pects of customer behavior, previous campaigns, strategies, etc. An important
decision needs to be made regarding depth of knowledge &ndash; is this an infor-
mation system or a knowledge system?
</p>
<p>The various means of creating knowledge described in Sect. 3.4.3 need to
be reviewed and prioritized. For example, how much will the knowledge man-
agement system rely on grafting? How will these activities be formalized? If
there is to be a large emphasis on undirected proactive research, do managers
have access to the tools they need to conduct that research? For example, if

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>64 3 Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>a manager wants to learn about what types of customer tier programs work,
does he or she have access to the customer data to conduct the investigation?
Does he or she have access to the library resources one needs to learn vicar-
iously about what other companies do and what academic researchers have
learned?
</p>
<p>Decisions need to be made on codification (Sect. 3.4.4). What will be re-
quired in terms of white papers and internal seminars? Is all the relevant
information being captured and put into a usable computer format? A key
decision here is on centralized versus decentralized repositories. As discussed
earlier, centralized is attractive for cross-referencing and access, but may not
be practical.
</p>
<p>The issues discussed in Sects. 3.4.5 and 3.4.6 need to be addressed in order
to make sure the knowledge will be transferred to those who need it, and in
turn that the recipients will indeed use the knowledge. For example, decisions
need be made that will ensure the system is used effectively. This includes
the fine line between encouraging use and requiring it. On one extreme, the
company can include a requirement that all proposals for marketing activi-
ties refer if possible to knowledge gleaned from the knowledge management
system. On the other extreme, there can be no requirements.
</p>
<p>A final step is to set up a mechanism for evaluating the system. Researchers
have conducted cross-sectional studies showing that companies with more
sophisticated knowledge management systems achieve better customer rela-
tionship outcomes (e.g., Chaston et al. 2003). However, to assess the value
of the knowledge management system for a particular firm, a before&ndash;after
type analysis is called for. This is difficult to execute because the knowl-
edge management system&rsquo;s value would appear mostly in the long-term. One
might find 2 years after implementing a knowledge management system that
retention and loyalty have decreased. However, these indicators might have
decreased even more if it weren&rsquo;t for the system. In some cases, competitive
data might be available to serve as a cross-sectional benchmark.
</p>
<p>Sharp (2003) describes one company&rsquo;s innovative approach to evaluating
its knowledge management investment. The company was Shell International
Exploration and Oil (SIEO). SIEO invested $6 million in a knowledge man-
agement system with a focus on enhancing knowledge transfer. SIEO mea-
sured ROI for this investment first by surveying disseminators of knowledge
as to what types of questions were being asked. This provided them with a
frequency distribution across all types of questions. SIEO then went to the
users (engineers) and asked them to put a dollar figure on how much the
information they received was worth for particular types of questions. These
numbers were multiplied by the distribution of questionnaire frequency to
determine ROI. SIEO calculated an ROI of 50, meaning that the $6 mil-
lion investment had generated $300 million in financial benefit over a 3-year
horizon.
</p>
<p>The obvious concern with this methodology is whether users can self-report
the value of the answers they receive. They may have a cognitive dissonance</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.5 Compensation and Incentives 65
</p>
<p>bias that inflates the value (&ldquo;I decided to use this system; therefore, it must be
valuable&rdquo;). In addition, there is no benchmark. What would have happened
if the knowledge management system had not been available? However, to
its credit, SIEO made a reasonable effort to determine what they had gained
from their investment.
</p>
<p>3.4.8 Issues and Challenges
</p>
<p>Knowledge management is clearly a crucial organizational process for imple-
menting database marketing. The organizational learning literature provides
a strong academic tradition in this area. But sorely needed are marketing-
oriented studies on all aspects of knowledge creation, codification, transfer-
ence, and usage, in a database marketing/CRM context. Among some of the
key issues are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Which knowledge creation activities are most important?
&bull; How important is knowledge management rather than information man-
</p>
<p>agement? Is it worthwhile to generate, store, and disseminate insights that
go beyond the narrow information typically available from compilations of
customer data?
</p>
<p>&bull; How do we ensure that potential users will actually use the knowledge
captured by the system (see Huber 1991)?
</p>
<p>&bull; How can companies evaluate their investment in a technology that is so
broad in scope and so long-term in presumed effect?
</p>
<p>&bull; What in fact are the typical ROI&rsquo;s earned by investments in knowledge
management systems, and what determines those ROI&rsquo;s?
</p>
<p>&bull; How important is organizational culture in the creation and use of knowl-
edge? Perhaps cultures that emphasize teamwork and collectivism are
more conducive to knowledge management effectiveness than cultures that
emphasize entrepreneurship (see Deshpandé et al. 1993).
</p>
<p>&bull; Can knowledge management be a source of competitive advantage? It
would appear that large-scale knowledge systems are imperfectly mobile,
although there can be some leakage if managers switch firms and bring
insights along with them.
</p>
<p>3.5 Compensation and Incentives
</p>
<p>Managers and employees in all organizations respond to incentives. For exam-
ple, if the company needs to increase its acquisition rate, employees should
be rewarded based on how many customers they acquire. Since database
marketing allows managers to measure performance more accurately, de-
veloping appropriate incentives becomes even more relevant for successful</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>66 3 Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>implementation of database marketing. We will review some theoretical work
in this area, and then discuss some empirical findings.
</p>
<p>3.5.1 Theory
</p>
<p>Hauser et al. (1994; &ldquo;HSW&rdquo;) conduct an economic analysis to investigate how
companies should use compensation incentives to reward employee-induced
increases in customer satisfaction (long-term) versus employee-created im-
mediate sales (short-term). In database marketing terms, this is the basic
trade-off between acquisition and retention. The model uses a principal-agent
framework where employees (agents) are not certain what will be the results
of their efforts, and company management (principal) cannot perfectly ob-
serve the amount of employees&rsquo; efforts. Companies compete on price and their
compensation reward structure.
</p>
<p>HSW construct a two-period model for two competing firms. Demand de-
pends on prices and customer perceptions of quality. Employees can expend
efforts to increase perceived quality, through efforts &ldquo;a&rdquo; that increase imme-
diate first period sales, and efforts &ldquo;b&rdquo; that increase satisfaction in the first
period and increase sales in the second period. The total employee effort is
a+ b. The firm cannot observe a or b directly, although first-period sales and
satisfaction are indirect measures of these efforts. Employees cannot directly
observe the impact of their efforts either, although they know what efforts
they expended.
</p>
<p>The focal firm and the competitor choose prices and compensation sys-
tems to maximize profits. The solution procedure assumes that the firms are
Stackelberg leaders with respect to employees in that employees optimize ef-
forts based on a set of prices and reward functions. Firms find optimal price
based on a given reward function, and then find the optimal reward function,
taking into account competitor as well as employee reactions. HSW show that
the derived compensation (w1 in period 1; w2 in period 2) are linear functions
of sales (q) and observed satisfaction (s):
</p>
<p>w1 = α1 + β1q1 + ηs (3.1a)
w2 = α2 + β2q2 (3.1b)
</p>
<p>A key finding is that firms are better off rewarding employee-induced im-
provements in customer satisfaction (η &gt; 0) as well as sales levels, no matter
what its competitor does. The result is quite sensible. Even though the firm
cannot observe employee efforts to create satisfaction, the firm knows that
satisfaction is created through these efforts and satisfaction increases second-
period sales. If customer satisfaction is not rewarded, the firm loses out on
second period sales. HSW provide insights on how various factors influence
the amount to which customer satisfaction should be rewarded:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.5 Compensation and Incentives 67
</p>
<p>&bull; The firm should put more emphasis on rewarding satisfaction if employees
are short-term oriented. If customers are not naturally long-term oriented,
they need incentives to make them so.
</p>
<p>&bull; If satisfaction can be measured with greater precision, more emphasis
should be placed on rewarding it. This makes sense in that if customer
satisfaction is measured perfectly, the firm has a better measure of em-
ployee efforts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Satisfaction efforts should be rewarded more if they are targeted at cus-
tomers who have low switching costs, i.e., are likely to churn without those
efforts. This makes sense because these customers will churn unless they
are satisfied.
</p>
<p>&bull; If a firm&rsquo;s baseline perceived quality level is larger, it should put more
emphasis on rewarding satisfaction.2 This is very important because it says
that the gains from rewarding customer satisfaction are greater among top
tier companies. This might be because the high quality firm can already
count on short-term sales so can invest more in creating the satisfaction
that will guarantee long-term sales.
</p>
<p>HSW provide insightful results that generally support compensation schemes
that reward employees who can create satisfied customers. One issue for
further research is whether rewarding customer satisfaction increases total
industry profits. Rewarding customer satisfaction could set off a &ldquo;customer-
satisfaction war&rdquo; where firms compete to acquire customers because once
these customers are acquired, they are locked in via customer satisfaction
incentives.
</p>
<p>Another area of reward compensation is for the statisticians who build
predictive models. As has been repeatedly shown in this book, database mar-
keting can have a direct and demonstrable impact on profits through better
targeting. It might therefore make sense to compensate model-builders on
the &ldquo;lift&rdquo; they generate from their models. A final area is how to compen-
sate employees for knowledge management, especially creation, codification,
and transference. It seems that incentives should especially encourage these
activities, since these do not have immediate pay-offs.
</p>
<p>3.5.2 Empirical Findings
</p>
<p>There are systematic and anecdotal empirical studies that are building a case
that compensation is a key ingredient to the success of database marketing
or CRM efforts.
</p>
<p>Reinartz et al. (2004) found evidence that compensating employees ac-
cording to their success in cultivating relationships with high value cus-
</p>
<p>2 This result is stated and proven in a working paper version of the paper (Hauser et al.
1992).</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>tomers plays a role in improving company performance. The authors sur-
veyed 211 managers and CRM experts in Austria, Germany, and Switzer-
land. They measured various aspects of CRM implementation along with
market-based performance measures including customer satisfaction, reten-
tion, company image, and customer benefits. The authors found for ex-
ample that &ldquo;CRM-Compatible Organizational Alignment&rdquo; enhanced com-
pany acquisition efforts in improving market performance. CRM-Compatible
Organizational Alignment was a 4-scale item that included incentives to de-
liver the appropriate service to customers based on customer tier, i.e., &ldquo;re-
warding employees for building and deepening relationships with high value
customers.&rdquo; Other items in the scale were less incentive specific (training,
organized to respond optimally to different customer groups, etc.) so it isn&rsquo;t
clear exactly what the incentive contribution is. However, incentives are def-
initely part of the picture.
</p>
<p>Peppers and Rogers (1997, pp. 79&ndash;98) describe an interesting case in-
volving the telecommunications firm MCI. Facing customer churn problems
in the early 1990s, MCI instituted a Customer First retention program.
The program focused on the top 5% of customers who generated 40% of
revenues. MCI assigned customer managers to portfolios of these customers,
and rewarded the customer managers based on retention-oriented metrics.
According to Peppers and Rogers, the program was beginning to succeed.
However, MCI&rsquo;s marketing group, which was compensated based on product-
sales statistics, did not like this program because it took away their prime
prospects for cross-selling and put them in the hands of the Sales and
Services group.
</p>
<p>Day and Van den Bulte (2002) surveyed 345 senior marketing, sales, and
MIS executives in US companies. They identified potential factors related
to CRM success, one of which they labeled &ldquo;Configuration.&rdquo; Configuration
involved &ldquo;organization structures, incentives, and controls.&rdquo; Configuration
turned out to be the most important factor underlying &ldquo;customer relationship
capability&rdquo; (CRC), and CRC was strongly related to customer retention,
sales growth, and profit. This provides further support that compensation
incentives are important.3
</p>
<p>Day (2003) reports that Siebel Systems ties 50% of management incentive
compensation to customer satisfaction, and 25% of salesperson compensation
to customer satisfaction. To link the employee efforts more directly to their
impact on satisfaction, Siebel pays the bonus 1 year after the signing of a
contract. Day also reports that Capital One allows a customer representative
leeway in the packages he or she can offer a would-be churner to induce the
churner to stay with Capital One. The representative is compensated based
on his or her ability to retain the customer with as profitable a package as
possible. In this way, Capital One rewards employees based on their ability
to improve profitable retention.
</p>
<p>3 Note however that Configuration was measured on a single scale that did not refer
directly to compensation.</p>

</p>
<p>Finally, Srinivasan and Moorman (2002) study the drivers of online re-
tailer performance. They relate organization factors to customer-related
investments, which in turn they relate to customer satisfaction, which in turn
they relate to performance. They verify the satisfaction-performance relation-
ship by linking BizRate.com customer ratings to executive-reported company
cash flow. The most important customer-related investment is found to be
expenditures on customer information systems. Having a customer-focused
reward system was the second-most important determinant of information
system expenditures (marketing/technology interactions were the most im-
portant). The implication is that setting up a CRM-related incentive system
enhances performance by motivating the company to make the right early in-
vestments in customer information technology that in turn pay off in higher
customer satisfaction and better company performance. Note this finding
also reinforces the Star model (Fig. 3.1), which points out that the elements
of organizational design (in this case compensation and knowledge manage-
ment) all highly related.
</p>
<p>3.5.3 Summary
</p>
<p>There is good evidence that compensation incentive systems should and do
play a role in successful implementation of database marketing. Most of this
work is on the incentives&ndash;customer satisfaction&ndash;performance link. Hauser et
al. (1994) provide the theoretical link, while Reinartz et al. (2004), Day and
Van den Bulte (2002), and Srinivasan and Moorman (2002) provide the em-
pirical links.
</p>
<p>While these results are promising, one important topic for future work is
coordinating the compensation schemes of various groups within the com-
pany. Hauser et al. (1994) propose that more incentives should relate most
directly to the fruits of an employee&rsquo;s effort. For example, if employees focus
on reducing churn, they should be compensated based on churn rate. Peppers
and Rogers&rsquo; (1997) MCI case, however, cites problems when one group being
compensated based on acquisition and one on retention. In the MCI case,
one group increased retention by &ldquo;fencing in&rdquo; the most profitable customers,
essentially taking them away from the other group that wanted to sell these
customers more products. Both groups were responding to the compensation
incentive structure, but they were in conflict.

<p>3.6.1 Providing Appropriate Support
</p>
<p>Once the firm&rsquo;s strategy, structure, knowledge management process, and com-
pensation are in place, employees need training and support. Training is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>70 3 Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>especially important for knowledge management, particularly with regard to
accessing and using the system (Payton and Zahay 2003). It is also important
with regard to customer versus product management &ndash; these are two differ-
ent mindsets. Finally, the organizational culture must reinforce what the rest
of the organizational design is trying to accomplish. For example, using the
culture types enunciated by Deshpandé et al. (1993), a &ldquo;Clan&rdquo; culture, which
is characterized by interpersonal cohesion, teamwork, and mentoring, might
be appropriate for a firm that wanted to put strong emphasis on the trans-
ference component of knowledge management. A &ldquo;Market&rdquo; culture, which
emphasizes goal achievement and competitiveness, might be more appropri-
ate for a firm that wanted to emphasize a highly results-oriented customer
management system.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of supporting people is the commitment of senior man-
agers. Senior managers can articulate their support for the organizational
design and reward individuals beyond the formal compensation plan. In ad-
dition, senior managers can contribute directly. For example, Senn (2006)
reports a &ldquo;Top Executive Relationship Process&rdquo; at Siemens Information and
Communications, in which top executives meet with Siemens&rsquo; customers&rsquo; top
management on a regular, planned basis.
</p>
<p>3.6.2 Intra-Firm Coordination
</p>
<p>No matter what organization design emerges from the Star model (Fig. 3.1),
it will only be successful to the extent that people work well with each other,
i.e., they coordinate. Three potential sources of coordination problems include
conflict, poor communication, and lack of education. Following is a list of
different personnel who need to coordinate, and potential issues that may
hinder coordination:
</p>
<p>Groups Coordination issue
Modelers and managers Communication, education
Acquirers and retainers Conflict
Customer managers and product managers Conflict
Channel managers Communication
Modelers and IT Communication, education
Marketing managers and IT Communication, education
Marketing and financial managers Conflict
Database marketers and senior management Communication, education
</p>
<p>We discuss these issues in more depth in the following two sections.
</p>
<p>3.6.2.1 Coordination Within the Marketing Function
</p>
<p>Modelers and Managers: Gillett (1999) points out that the model builders and
the managers who use modeling results need to coordinate effectively in order</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.6 People 71
</p>
<p>for database marketing to be successful. According to Gillett, this entails
understanding each other&rsquo;s needs, managing expectations, and understanding
each other&rsquo;s capabilities. These are largely communication and education
issues. The model builder needs to be able to translate a business problem,
e.g., how to cross-sell effectively, into a statistical analysis that solves the
problem. The manager needs to have some idea what models can and cannot
do. For example, predictive modeling is very good at prioritizing customers
in terms of responsiveness, but not as good at drawing the line in terms of
who should or should not be targeted. Managers also need to have realistic
expectations on how fast models can be built and how accurate they can be.
With today&rsquo;s emphasis on downsized staffing, it is very easy for managers
to make unrealistic demands on model-builders. It is difficult for a manager
to fathom why it takes a week to produce a predictive model, but these
expectations need to be set appropriately.
</p>
<p>Gillett (1999) recommends that data-mining should be a team effort, com-
prised of an IT specialist (for the data), a statistician (to do the data mining),
and a manager (to make sure the effort fulfills a business need). The benefits
of team play are (1) a result that&rsquo;s more likely to improve business perfor-
mance, and (2) a set of insights that&rsquo;s more likely to increase the company&rsquo;s
knowledge base long-term.
</p>
<p>Acquirers and Retainers: One of the hallmarks of the customer-centric or-
ganization is separate management of acquisition and retention (Sect. 3.3.5).
However, these functions have potentially conflicting mindsets. Acquirers are
volume and short-term oriented, since their task is easily quantified. Re-
tainers are customer relationship and long-term oriented. Problems occur
when the acquirers attract customers who are difficult to retain. For exam-
ple, a telecom company may find it easier to attract young users, but these
are precisely the customers who innately are more difficult to retain. On
the other hand, the customers who are easiest to retain might be the most
difficult to acquire. For example, if older people are more naturally brand
loyal, they are attractive for the retainers, but difficult for the acquirers to
attract.
</p>
<p>Customer managers and product managers: The conflict here is that cus-
tomer managers may demand products that product managers can&rsquo;t pro-
duce. For example, the customer manager for teenagers may ask for a line of
personal computers with high styling and large disk capacity. That sounds
fine, but the product manager for personal computers may also be besieged
with requests for other product features from the business customer man-
ager, the educational institution customer manager, and the family customer
manager.
</p>
<p>Channel managers: Marketing can be organized by channel, and this raises
coordination issues (Botwinik 2001). One problem is that in many companies,
the online channel initially was set up as a separate profit center as a way to
establish a company&rsquo;s web presence. Now companies have that presence, and
they need to coordinate among the channels. Whereas originally there may</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72 3 Organizing for Database Marketing
</p>
<p>have a conflict between channel managers in that they were seen as competing
for the same customer, now the issue is more on communicating effectively so
that the overall customer needs are addressed. As a simple example, a direct
sales representative needs to have the customer&rsquo;s online purchase records
easily on hand.
</p>
<p>Different marketing functional managers: Botwinik (2001) argues that
various marketing functions, e.g., marketing, sales, and service, view their
domains as distinct and rarely coordinate. However, the customer views his
or her relationship with the firm in terms of the overall experience. For ex-
ample, the customer may have problems with Internet response time. The
customer calls customer service, who may fix the immediate problem, but
the real problem is that the customer has the wrong computer. Marketing
can help identify that need. Then sales can help define the specs for the re-
placement computer. The three groups need to be communicating with each
other so each of them can route customers seamlessly to the appropriate
department.
</p>
<p>3.6.2.2 Coordinating Outside the Marketing Function
</p>
<p>Modelers and IT : While modelers and IT people are both technically oriented,
it is not necessarily the case that these two groups communicate easily. Data
managers are responsible for organizing so many different data entities that
they have a hard time sitting down with an applied model-builder and helping
to stipulate the database for a predictive modeling project. On the other
hand, modelers may have little taste for defining the variables in the database
&ndash; they&rsquo;re more interested in seeing what predictive power they can get for a
given set of variables, and what statistical techniques work best. Put simply,
the data managers need to take a course in statistics, and the data miners
need to take a course in data management.
</p>
<p>Marketing Managers and IT : IT departments typically handle data for
the entire company, including finance and operations as well as marketing.
As a result, the marketing department can wait an inordinate amount of
time before the database it needs is assembled. The Directors of IT, Mar-
keting, Finance, Operations, and Human Resources need to coordinate and
set priorities. Coordination problems also occur when marketing managers
want to access the data warehouse through queries, and can&rsquo;t easily trans-
late their needs into a query the system can handle. Cunningham et al. (2006)
describe an evaluation tool that can used to measure how well the system
satisfies management needs. This should enhance coordination between IT
and managers.
</p>
<p>Marketing Managers and Financial Managers: This is an arena of potential
conflict. The conflict stems from a classic tradeoff between Type I and Type II
error (see Chapter 10). Type I error is not contacting a customer when contact
would improve profits. Type II error is contacting a customer although this</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3.6 People 73
</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t improve profits. The problem is that it is difficult to minimize both
errors &ndash; there is an inherent conflict.
</p>
<p>The problem is that marketing, i.e., customer managers, talk about in-
vesting in customers and producing long-term results. They feel that Type
I is the worse error &ndash; nothing is worse than not increasing customer
value when the opportunity is there. Financial managers however are more
naturally concerned with Type II errors. The worse thing is to waste money
on customers who are not worth it. Simply understanding each other&rsquo;s error
priorities would go a long way for helping to resolve conflicts, but it appears
that someone is needed to set the tone for which error is more important.
</p>
<p>Database marketers and senior management : The issue here is one of com-
munication and education, primarily on the part of senior management. Se-
nior management needs to have a clear understanding of what database mar-
keting can do, and database marketing needs to avoid over-selling what it can
do. This is similar to the miscommunications that can occur between data
miners and marketing managers, but on a more strategic scale.</p>

<p>Chapter 4
</p>
<p>Customer Privacy and
Database Marketing
</p>
<p>Abstract Probably the single most important aspect of the legal environ-
ment pertaining to database marketing is customer privacy. We examine this
issue in depth. Privacy is a multidimensional issue for customers, and we
begin by reviewing the nature and potential consequences of these several
dimensions. We discuss the evidence regarding the impact of customers&rsquo; con-
cerns for privacy on their behavior &ndash; there is some although not definitive
evidence for example that privacy concerns hinder e-commerce. We discuss
current firm practices regarding privacy, as well as some of the major laws
regarding customer privacy. We conclude with a review of potential solutions
to privacy concerns, including regulation, permission-based marketing, and a
strategic focus on trust.
</p>
<p>4.1 Background
</p>
<p>4.1.1 Customer Privacy Concerns and Their
Consequences for Database Marketers
</p>
<p>Customer privacy in database marketing pertains to the customer&rsquo;s ability
to control the collection, usage, and anonymity of his or her data. The basic
premise of database marketing is exchange: companies collect and analyze
customer data, and in return provide customers with more appropriate prod-
ucts, services, and offers. However, this premise is muddled when customers
become concerned about privacy. Figure 4.1 outlines these concerns and their
ramifications.1
</p>
<p>1 See Smith et al&rsquo;s (1996) and Stewart and Segars (2002) for a formally developed measure-
ment instrument of privacy concerns &ndash; the &ldquo;Concern for Information Privacy&rdquo; (CFIP)
scale. This scale taps the security, third-party access, none-of-your-business, and fear of
errors dimensions of information privacy discussed in this section.

<p>76 4 Customer Privacy and Database Marketing
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.1 Customers&rsquo; privacy concerns and their ramifications for database marketers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Data security : Customers fear that computer hackers can gain access to
their data. High-profile cases of &ldquo;identity theft&rdquo; fuel this fear. In one in-
stance, ChoicePoint, a collector and seller of customer-level data available
in the public domain, revealed that an identity-theft ring gained access to
145,000 records in its database (Perez 2005). The data included names,
addresses, and social security numbers. Another well-known data com-
pany, Lexis-Nexis, revealed that criminals gained access to social security
numbers, driver&rsquo;s license information, and addresses of 310,000 individu-
als (Timmons and Zeller Jr. 2005). These cases suggest to consumers that
even if the companies collecting the data are well-meaning, these compa-
nies cannot protect the privacy of their data.
Data security also pertains to access by persons within the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion. For example, a patient might be comfortable with a physician seeing
his or her medical history, but not a medical student or a departmental
administrator.
</p>
<p>&bull; Secretive data collection (George 2002): Customers suspect that companies
collect data from them without their knowledge. The most conspicuous
example is the use of cookies, a few lines of computer code inserted by
an Internet website into the customer&rsquo;s computer that can then be used
to track the customer over time (Turner and Dasgupta 2003). Cookies are
usually inserted without the customer&rsquo;s permission. It is not the tracking
per se that bothers customers, but the surreptitious nature of the data
collection.
</p>
<p>&bull; Junk mail and spam (George 2002): Some customers fear that data col-
lection leads to unwanted junk mail and emails. Good predictive models</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.1 Background 77
</p>
<p>should address this concern, as companies use these models only to target
customers who will respond. But the best predictive models might boost a
1% response rate up to a 5&ndash;7% response rate. That can mean huge profits
for the database marketers (Chapter 10), but the 93% who do not respond
might view the solicitations as an invasion of privacy.
</p>
<p>&bull; Third-party access (Smith et al&rsquo;s 1996; Turner and Dasgupta 2003; George
2002): Customers realize that the company with whom they do business
may sell the data it collects to unknown third parties euphemistically called
&ldquo;partners.&rdquo; Customers may not mind the company that collects the data
using it, but want to control who else gets to use the data.
</p>
<p>&bull; None of your business (Smith et al&rsquo;s 1996; George 2002; Winer 2001):
The customer may simply feel that it is none of the company&rsquo;s business
to know what types of books, movies, electronic equipment, etc., that the
customer prefers, or what areas of the country (or what countries) the
customer calls on the telephone. These customers view their relationship
with the company as purely transactional, and resent being classified as
&ldquo;mystery book readers&rdquo; or &ldquo;international callers&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>&bull; Feelings of violation (Winer 2001): Winer (2001) states this as, &ldquo;How do
they know that about me?&rdquo; For example, a direct marketer may use a
compiled database (Chapter 8) to learn that a customer reads Newsweek
and recently purchased a high definition television. Even if the customer
knows data are being collected and databases are being merged, when the
company reveals what it knows to the customer, the overall data collection
effort seems more invasive.
</p>
<p>&bull; Inequitable exchange (Fletcher 2003): While the premise of database mar-
keting is for the customer to sacrifice some privacy in exchange for better
service, prices, product, etc., some customers may not view this as an eq-
uitable exchange. Either they don&rsquo;t see the benefits of better targeting, or
they view the costs of sacrificing privacy as too high. Either way, they view
the database marketing exchange equation as an inequality, not favorably
in their direction.
</p>
<p>&bull; Fear of Errors (Smith et al&rsquo;s 1996): Customers may fear that the data
collected on them may include errors. The errors could occur through
computer &ldquo;glitches&rdquo; or human mistakes. The end result is that the com-
pany may have an incorrect profile of the customer, without either the
firm or the customer knowing it.
</p>
<p>As Fig. 4.1 shows, there are four key ramifications of these privacy concerns.
First, customer fears about privacy can decrease sales volume. Stewart and
Segars (2002) found that consumers who were concerned with privacy in-
tended to remove their names from mailing lists or were less likely to pur-
chase products simply because of the manner in which the company used
personal data. The issue is especially relevant for the Internet. Udo (2001) sur-
veyed 158 online users and found that privacy and security concerns were the
number one issue hampering more purchasing on the Internet. A Microsoft
&ldquo;Presspass&rdquo; (Microsoft 2000) suggested, based on a Forrester Research study,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>78 4 Customer Privacy and Database Marketing
</p>
<p>that customer privacy concerns decreased Internet sales by $12.2 billion in
2000.
</p>
<p>Second, privacy concerns may limit the data available to companies, there-
fore decreasing the precision and profitability of predictive modeling. Stewart
and Segars (2002) found that consumers who were concerned with privacy
were more likely to refuse to give information to companies. For existing
customers, purchase history is typically the most important variable driving
predictive model accuracy (e.g., Knott et al. 2002), and companies automati-
cally collect those data. However, when acquiring new customers, the prospect
has no purchase history with the company, so demographic and other cus-
tomer characteristic data become very important. If cookies were outlawed,
companies would not be able to track customers&rsquo; Internet search preferences
and behaviors &ndash; variables that are becoming important in predictive models.
In the extreme, if companies were prohibited from using prior purchase his-
tories to tailor campaigns, predictive modeling would virtually be brought to
a standstill.
</p>
<p>Third, privacy can increase costs. Turner (2001) notes that restrictions
on access to external customer data could increase costs by 3.5&ndash;11%. This
diminishes the efficiency of database marketing.
</p>
<p>Fourth, managers may face difficult ethical questions if they find them-
selves collecting data the customer doesn&rsquo;t want them to collect. A good
test of ethical behavior is, &ldquo;Would I be embarrassed if the public knew my
actions?&rdquo; In the case of collecting and utilizing data that customers would
prefer to remain private, the answer to that question may be &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; This puts
well-meaning managers in an ethical dilemma.
</p>
<p>In summary, consumers have several concerns about privacy. The ramifi-
cations of these concerns are: (1) lower customer expenditures especially on
the Internet, (2) less data available for predictive models, (3) higher costs
for companies complying with various privacy rules, and (4) difficult ethical
concerns for managers.
</p>
<p>4.1.2 Historical Perspective
</p>
<p>Concerns about customer privacy are not new. They probably emerged when
customer data were first punched onto computer cards in the 1960s. One of
the first uses of customer data was in the financial sector, where decisions
needed to be made about customer credit-worthiness. Concerns about pri-
vacy led to the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 and the Privacy Act of
1974, which delineated consumers&rsquo; rights with regard to credit information
(Turner and Dasgupta 2003). As technological sophistication increased and
firms began to match and merge files and communicate information seam-
lessly, more legislation was passed &ndash; the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act of 1986 and the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988
(Turner and Dasgupta 2003). Despite these steps, a 1992 survey found that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.2 Customer Attitudes Toward Privacy 79
</p>
<p>76% of consumers felt they had lost control over how information about them
was collected and used by organizations (Turner and Dasgupta 2003).
</p>
<p>A landmark privacy event of the Internet age was DoubleClick&rsquo;s purchase
of Abacus in 1999 (Winer 2001). DoubleClick&rsquo;s specialty was the placement
of Internet ads, and accordingly had cookie-based information on many con-
sumers. Abacus was a customer-list exchange company that as a result had
data on off-line purchase habits, as well as names and addresses, of millions
of customers. DoubleClick&rsquo;s strategy was to merge their Internet data with
Abacus&rsquo; offline data. This would create a highly revealing portrait of millions
of customers. The resounding negative publicity resulted in DoubleClick&rsquo;s
declaring it would refrain from this plan. What DoubleClick was propos-
ing was no different from many of the merge&ndash;purge operations that go on
when various lists are combined. However, the magnitude of DoubleClick&rsquo;s
endeavor, plus the involvement of the Internet, raised public awareness and
kindled the fears raised above.
</p>
<p>The Internet and rising privacy concerns in areas such as health care and
the exploitation of children have given rise to a plethora of privacy laws; we
will briefly review a few of these in Sect. 4.3.3. The fact that these regulations
are part of a historical progression suggests that as technology develops and
data collection and dissemination becomes more and more seamless, more
legislation will be forthcoming.
</p>
<p>4.2 Customer Attitudes Toward Privacy
</p>
<p>While the above suggests the nature of the fears customers have regarding
privacy, there has been some research that has measured customer attitudes
and their impact on purchase behavior. In addition, segmentation schemes
have been proposed for conceptualizing customer heterogeneity with respect
to privacy.
</p>
<p>4.2.1 Segmentation Schemes
</p>
<p>Ackerman et al. (1999) surveyed web users and identified three segments with
regard to privacy and the Internet. (a) Fundamentalists, who are very con-
cerned about the use of data and do not want to provide any data through
websites. (b) Pragmatists, who are concerned about privacy but whose fears
could be allayed by laws, privacy policy statements, and the like. (c) Marginal-
ists, who are only marginally concerned with the issue. The authors found
that Fundamentalists comprised 17% of their sample, Pragmatists 56%, and
Marginalists 27%. This suggests that extreme concerns about privacy are con-
fined to a minority. However, if Fundamentalists publicize privacy concerns
(e.g., the DoubleClick escapade) and if companies do not allay the concerns</p>

</p>
<p>of the Pragmatists, these consumers could easily move to the Fundamentalist
camp.
</p>
<p>A follow-up study conducted in Germany (Grimm and Rossnagel 2000)
similarly found 30% Fundamentalists and 24% Marginalists. The 45% Prag-
matists were further subdivided into those concerned with identity (20%)
versus profiling (25%). Identity would appear easier to deal with, because
companies can use household ID&rsquo;s and contact individuals only after merging
the ID&rsquo;s with the names/addresses/phone number file, which could be held
by a third party or at least by a limited set of individuals in the organization.
However, concerns about profiling seem endemic to what database market-
ing is all about. Predictive models essentially profile customers most likely
to respond, most likely to churn, most likely to be profitable, etc.
</p>
<p>Fletcher (2003) proposes a segmentation scheme depicted in Fig. 4.2. The
scheme is based on two factors: attitudes toward and trust of the benefits
of direct marketing, and knowledge and awareness with respect to privacy
issues. Fletcher identifies four segments. (a) Silent majority, who have low
knowledge awareness of privacy issues, but positive attitudes toward direct
marketing. This group is cooperative but should be educated about the use of
data and privacy issues, so they do not turn on companies if they see negative
publicity. (b) Sleepers, who also have low knowledge and awareness of privacy
issues, but are inherently hostile to direct marketing. There is little that can
be done with this group in terms of bringing them into the CRM world.
(c) Partners, who are highly aware of privacy issues but have positive views
on direct marketing. These are the customers who &ldquo;buy into&rdquo; the database
marketing exchange equation. (d) Activists, who are highly aware of privacy
issues and have negative views on direct marketing. These are similar to the
Fundamentalists. CRM companies need to try to educate these people on the
value of direct marketing.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.2 Customer Attitudes Toward Privacy 81
</p>
<p>The above segmentation schemes are useful but need more testing and
refinement. Complicating the picture is that segment sizes and intensity of
feelings probably differ by product category (see Bart et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>4.2.2 Impact of Attitudes on Database
Marketing Behaviors
</p>
<p>The key issue is how consumer attitudes toward privacy affect their attitudes
toward various purchase behaviors in a database marketing environment. As
mentioned earlier, Stewart and Segars found that consumers who were more
concerned about privacy stated they would be more likely to request their
names be removed from a mailing list, more likely to refuse to give information
to a company, and more likely to refuse to buy a product because of the
manner in which a company used personal information.
</p>
<p>Verhoef et al. (2007) related customer attribute ratings of various sales
channels (Internet, Catalog, Telephone) to their attitudes toward searching
and purchasing on these channels. One attribute was the extent to which their
privacy was guaranteed when purchasing on these channels. This attribute
related negatively to purchasing on the Internet, significantly but less im-
portantly to purchasing via catalog, and was not a significant determinant
of purchasing in the store. These results make sense and highlight the pri-
vacy concerns evoked by the Internet. They also demonstrate that privacy
concerns inhibit purchasing, and therefore slow down Internet commerce.
</p>
<p>George (2002) studied the relationships among Internet experience, belief
that one&rsquo;s data belong to oneself (&ldquo;Property View&rdquo;), trust in the privacy
offered by the Internet, concerns with the security of buying on the Internet,
Internet purchase intent, and Internet purchasing. The main results, based

<p>Internet purchase intent and purchasing. Also, Internet experience is neg-
atively associated with the property view of one&rsquo;s data, which in turn
begets more favorable attitudes toward Internet security, and ultimately,
higher Internet purchase intent and purchasing. In short, Internet expe-
rience induces favorable attitude changes that further enhance Internet
usage.
</p>
<p>George combines &ldquo;trust&rdquo; and &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; in his Internet Trust scale. Bart et
al. (2005) separate the two. They measured trust as an overall belief that the
website delivers on its promises and that the information on the website is
believable. Privacy was measured in terms of the clarity of the privacy policy.
They find that privacy affects trust, which in turn affects behavioral intent
to use the Internet.
</p>
<p>In a study reported by Peppers and Rogers (2004a), Intel and Urban found
that levels of trust affected the number of software downloads from an Intel
website. Privacy was not part of this study, but it reinforces the importance
of trust in Internet marketing (see also Pepe 2005).
</p>
<p>The emergence of trust as a key factor is very important. Trust is a broader
issue than privacy &ndash; for example, it involves trusting the product recommen-
dations made from the site, which is not a privacy issue &ndash; but it is not
surprising that privacy concerns manifest themselves in a lack of trust. Note
there may be reverse causality here. Surely privacy concerns undermine trust,
but lack of trust could also trigger privacy concerns.
</p>
<p>While the above studies clearly show that privacy concerns inhibit Internet
purchasing Turner and Dasgupta (2003) suggest that consumers may be more
willing to provide data than their attitudes indicate. Chain Store Age (2002)
reports that 70% of US consumers report worrying about privacy, but only
40% bother to read privacy policies. On the other hand, Clampet (2005a)
reports that 86% of consumers have asked to be removed from a mailing list,
and 83% have refused to provide information because it was too personal.
</p>
<p>4.2.3 International Differences in Privacy Concerns
</p>
<p>An interesting question is whether privacy concerns differ across coun-
tries. Milberg et al. (1995) examined the inter-relationships among
cultural values, regulatory environment, and information privacy con-
cerns across nine countries. Cultural values included uncertainty avoid-
ance index (UAI), power distance index (PDI), and individualism
(IDV) (Hofstede 1980, 1991). UAI measures the degree to which
society is averse to uncertainty. Milberg et al. hypothesized that
consumers from countries with high UAI should have higher concerns for
privacy. PDI measures the degree of inequality among various social classes.
Milberg et al. hypothesized that consumers from high PDI countries will be
more concerned about privacy, since high PDI countries are characterized by
lower levels of trust. IDV measures the degree of independence encouraged in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.2 Customer Attitudes Toward Privacy 83
</p>
<p>society. Milberg et al. hypothesized that consumers from high IDV countries
would be associated with higher concerns for privacy.
</p>
<p>For each of the nine countries, cultural values were measured using Hof-
stede&rsquo;s classifications. Regulatory levels were measured using the authors&rsquo;
judgments of the degree of regulation (low to high). The authors surveyed
900 members (IT professionals and financial auditors) of the Information
Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) to measure the concern for
privacy, using Smith et al&rsquo;s (1996) privacy measurement instrument.
</p>
<p>The results were that (1) the level of concern for privacy differs across
countries, (2) however, the prioritization of concerns for various privacy is-
sues is the same, with secondary use first, improper access second, errors
third, and collection fourth, (3) cultural values were not associated with pri-
vacy concerns, and (4) cultural values were associated with the degree of
privacy regulation. Power distance and uncertainty avoidance were positively
associated with the degree of regulation, and individuality was negatively
associated with the degree of regulation.
</p>
<p>These results are interesting and establish inter-country differences in
privacy concerns. However, it is interesting that cultural values affected
the degree of regulation while not apparently affecting concern for privacy.
Milberg et al. (2000) conducted another survey of 595 ISACA members. They
examined 19 countries rather than 9, and used partial least squares analysis
rather than simple F-tests. In this study, they found that indeed, cultural
values affected both the degree of regulation and the concern for privacy.
PDI, IDV, and Masculinity (MASC) were positively associated with privacy
concerns, whereas UAI was negatively associated with privacy concerns. Like
their previous study, they found that UAI was positively associated with de-
gree of regulation, and that IDV was negatively associated with regulation.
They also found that MASC was negatively associated with degree of regu-
lation. However, contrary to their previous study, they found that PDI was
negatively associated with degree of regulation.
</p>
<p>Bellman et al. (2004) surveyed 534 Internet users across 38 countries. Their
research differs from the Milberg et al. studies in that Bellman et al. survey
consumers. The authors examined three potential correlates of concern for
information privacy: (1) cultural values (PDI, IND, UAI, and MASC), (2)
current privacy regulatory structure, and (3) experience with using the In-
ternet. Current privacy regulations were classified across countries as &ldquo;No
regulation or self help,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sectoral&rdquo; (meaning regulations specific to partic-
ular industries), and &ldquo;Omnibus&rdquo; (meaning general regulations that apply
across industries).
</p>
<p>The authors examined the role of regulatory approach as a mediator of
the relationship between cultural values and concern for information privacy.
Their results suggested that indeed regulatory approach mediated this rela-
tionship, in that the relationship between cultural values and overall concern
for information privacy became insignificant when regulatory approach was
added to the analysis.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>84 4 Customer Privacy and Database Marketing
</p>
<p>However, there were relationships between cultural values and various sub-
scales of the concern for information privacy measure. For example, respon-
dents from cultures with lower IND indices indicated higher levels of concern
for errors in the database; respondents from cultures with low PDI and low
MASC had higher levels of concern about unauthorized secondary use; re-
spondents from cultures with low PDI desired more privacy regulation and
those from cultures with low MASC were more concerned about data secu-
rity. In addition, online privacy concerns were negatively related to Internet
experience.
</p>
<p>Summarizing the Milberg et al. and Bellman et al. studies, concerns for
privacy differ across countries. However, findings regarding the relationships
between these concerns and cultural values, the desire for regulation, and
regulatory environment have not been consistent. Milberg et al. (1995) find no
relationship between cultural values and overall concern for privacy, whereas
Milberg et al. (2000) find several results, and Bellman et al. (2004) find
relationships between cultural values and particular subscales of the overall
concern for privacy.
</p>
<p>The studies differ in several ways. The Milberg et al. studies sample infor-
mation system experts and financial auditors, whereas Bellman et al. sample
consumers. Milberg et al. (1995) use simple statistical tests, Milberg et al.
(2000) use partial least squares, and Bellman et al. use multivariate analysis
of variance and mediation tests. An underlying issue here is to decide what
is the underlying structural model?
</p>
<p>One possible structure is shown in Fig. 4.4. In this model, the most
straightforward path is that cultural values influence concern for privacy,
which in turn influences desire for regulation, which in turn influences reg-
ulatory structure. However, cultural values might also have a direct impact
on desire for regulation, which also influences regulatory structure, so con-
cern for privacy might not play a role in determining regulatory structure.
In addition, regulatory structure can influence concern for privacy as well
as the desire for regulation. So there is also reverse causality in the model.
Unraveling these relationships would be difficult but important. In addition,
Bellman et al. show that consumers&rsquo; Internet experience is associated with
lower privacy concerns. Perhaps &ldquo;Database Marketing Experience&rdquo; should be
added to the framework.

<p>4.3 Current Practices Regarding Privacy 85
</p>
<p>4.3 Current Practices Regarding Privacy
</p>
<p>4.3.1 Privacy Policies
</p>
<p>Companies &ndash; especially those selling through the Internet and catalogs &ndash;
have adopted official privacy policies that they make available to consumers,
typically on web-sites. There are three key components of these policies:
</p>
<p>&bull; Opt-in vs. Opt-out : &ldquo;Opt-in&rdquo; means that the customer has the opportunity
proactively to agree to various uses of their data, where the &ldquo;null&rdquo; is that
the data will not be used. Opt-out means that the customer can proactively
assert that their data are not to be used, where the &ldquo;null&rdquo; is that the data
will be used.
</p>
<p>&bull; Internal vs. third-party usage: Companies may use the data only for their
own marketing efforts, or they may &ldquo;partner&rdquo; with other companies. They
may sell the data to another company, e.g., a magazine may sell its sub-
scription list to direct marketers, or the company might serve as an in-
termediary for transmitting offers to customers. For example, a cell-phone
company might partner with an electronics company and offer a certain
subset of its customers a deal on a DVD player.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer characteristic versus purchase history data: Some companies
only collect customer characteristic data such as age, gender, etc. Others,
in fact most, also collect purchase history data.
</p>
<p>These components suggest a taxonomy for privacy policies. For example, a
company might be opt-in/only for internal use, for customer characteristic
data, and opt-out/third-party use, for purchase history data. To gauge the
prevalence of the various policies, we analyzed the privacy policies of the
top 50 catalogers ranked by Catalog Age (2003). We visited each company
website, read its privacy statement, and classified the policy accordingly.2 The
results are in Fig. 4.5. It was often difficult to interpret the various policies
(this is an issue itself) and so these results should be taken as exploratory.
However, the figure suggests some interesting findings:
</p>
<p>&bull; Opt-out is more prevalent than Opt-in. This is interesting, but begs the
question of why opt-out is more popular. One hypothesis is that con-
sumers make the choice that requires the least effort (see Bellman et al.
and Sect. 4.4.3).
</p>
<p>&bull; Both personal characteristic and purchase history data are collected. This
was sometimes difficult to gauge, especially regarding purchase history, and
we classified nine companies as &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say&rdquo; regarding their use of purchase
history data. But it appears that companies do inform customers that they
are collecting both personal characteristic and purchase history data.
</p>
<p>2 The authors expressly thank Carmen-Maria Navarro for invaluable research assistance
in this endeavor.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>86 4 Customer Privacy and Database Marketing
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.5 Privacy statement practices among top 50 catalog companies in 2003.
</p>
<p>&bull; While opt-out is the most popular policy, there are a surprising number of
instances where customers are simply informed of how the data are used
and nothing stated about opting in or out.
</p>
<p>Again, these results are exploratory, but they suggest a number of issues
for further investigation in company use of privacy statements. First is
that indeed, privacy statements are commonly made public but they are
non-standardized and often difficult to interpret (see also Martin et al.
2000).
</p>
<p>Second, companies seem to prefer opt-out. However, it isn&rsquo;t clear that
this is the optimal policy. Since many customers do not read the privacy
statements, they may not realize that their data is going to be used, possibly
by third parties as well as the collecting firm. When they receive various offers
that they then feel are an invasion of privacy, this only exacerbates the privacy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Current Practices Regarding Privacy 87
</p>
<p>problem and lowers response. It might be that if companies publicized their
privacy statements better and utilized opt-in, privacy fears would be allayed
and companies would be left with a highly responsive group. Opt-in might
provide the first node in a decision tree predictive model in that those who
do not op-in probably are less responsive.
</p>
<p>Third, what is the optimum combination of policies for own versus
third-party use, and for personal characteristics versus purchase history?
Chen et al. (2001) use a game-theoretic analysis to show it may be of interest
for a firm to sell its customer information to another firm (see Sect. 4.4.7). An-
other consideration in sharing information is whether to identify the partner
with whom the information is shared. If that firm is prestigious, the customer
may be more satisfied with the firm&rsquo;s sharing data with third parties and view
it as an opportunity to form relationships with prestigious firms.
</p>
<p>Fourth, exactly what it means to use or share data needs to be explained
thoroughly to the customer. In the experience of the authors, a company
would rarely provide their customers&rsquo; complete purchase history data to a
third party together with names and addresses. Instead, a third party might
make a request, e.g., &ldquo;extend this offer to customers who&rsquo;ve bought a high
definition television set over the last year&rdquo;. Serving as a conduit rather than
actually giving the data to the third party might be perceived as less in-
vasive by customers. In short, the black box of what it means to share
customer information with third parties perhaps should be opened up for
consumers.
</p>
<p>4.3.2 Collecting Data
</p>
<p>The manner in which companies collect data can increase privacy concerns.
For example, companies often compile purchase histories directly from trans-
actions. This is a seamless, unobtrusive way of collecting data. Internet com-
panies, however, may want to collect data on customer search behavior. For
this, they use cookies, thus potentially alarming the customer that their pri-
vacy is being invaded. Bricks-and-mortar stores have an even more chal-
lenging situation. It is often very difficult for them to &ldquo;match-back&rdquo; store
purchases to the company&rsquo;s house file. Retailers therefore find themselves in-
stituting a loyalty program, primarily for the purpose of collecting customer
data! Registration for the card usually requires the customer to answer a few
questions, at a minimum name and address, so it is easy to track customers
who use their loyalty card.
</p>
<p>Data on personal characteristics are collected in various ways: (1) upon
registration at a web site or for a loyalty card, (2) from &ldquo;complilers&rdquo; such as
Equifax, that collect as much publicly available information as possible on
millions of individuals, (3) from purchasing lists (e.g., a company can pur-
chase a list subscribers to a particular magazine), and (4) from data sharing
(Stone and Condron 2002) and cooperative exchanges.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>88 4 Customer Privacy and Database Marketing
</p>
<p>A well-known exchange forum in the catalog industry is run by Abacus.
Companies contribute names to a database (perhaps with additional infor-
mation such as whether the person has purchased in the last X months) and
in turn withdraw names from the pool. Companies can specify certain com-
petitors that cannot be allowed access to their names. In addition, sometimes
companies exchange names directly. For example, company A and company
B may provide each other access to 100,000 customers on their &ldquo;12-month
buyer&rdquo; list. These exchanges can be a crucial way that companies acquire
customers, and acquisition efforts arguably lower prices for the sought-after
customers. In addition, the availability of list exchanges lowers the costs of
customer acquisition, further driving down prices.
</p>
<p>But should customers be informed of this practice? If informed, would
so many customers opt out that this would cease to become a productive
way of acquiring customers, driving up price? Chen et al. (2001) also would
argue that information exchange could increase prices because it cushions
price competition. How would customers react to this theory in terms of
their attitudes toward sharing data?
</p>
<p>4.3.3 The Legal Environment
</p>
<p>A host of legislation has been enacted in the USA, Europe, and the rest
of the world as well. Europe is known for its 1995 &ldquo;Directive on Data
Privacy,&rdquo; (http://europa.eu.int/eurlex/lex/Notice.do?val = 307229:cs&amp;lang
= en&amp;list = 307229:cs,&amp;pos = 1&amp;page = 1&amp;nbl = 1&amp;pgs = 10&amp;checktexte =
checkbox&amp;visu=#texte), which places the burden on organizations to seek
permission before using personal information for any purpose (Turner and
Dasgupta 2003). Specific provisions include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Data must be &ldquo;collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes.&rdquo;
&bull; The consumer (&ldquo;data subject&rdquo;) must be told &ldquo;the purposes of the process-
</p>
<p>ing for which the data are intended.&rdquo;
&bull; &ldquo;Personal data may be processed only if the data subject has unambigu-
</p>
<p>ously given his consent.&rdquo;
&bull; The consumer must be informed of the &ldquo;right of access to and the right to
</p>
<p>rectify the data concerning him . . . to guarantee fair processing in respect
of the data subject.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; The company &ldquo;controller&rdquo; of the data must notify a &ldquo;supervisory author-
ity,&rdquo; a public authority for the correct administration of the law, &ldquo;before
carrying out . . . automatic processing . . . &rdquo; of data.
</p>
<p>&bull; Data transfer to another country can take place only if &ldquo;the third country
in question ensures an adequate level of protection.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The directive pursues a full disclosure policy &ndash; the consumer will know what
data are being processed for what purposes, will have access to the data, and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.3 Current Practices Regarding Privacy 89
</p>
<p>can consent or not consent to particular analyses of the data. In addition,
the directive sets up a public official to administer the law, and requires
companies to report to this official.
</p>
<p>The dictum that data transfer can take place only to a country that has
an &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; level of protection raised concerns among US companies, since
the USA does not offer as much protection as the European Directive. As a
result, customer lists that flow freely within the USA might not flow from
Europe to the USA. This would hamper direct marketing efforts of US compa-
nies in Europe, for example, US credit card companies seeking to acquire new
customers. In 2000, negotiators created a &ldquo;Safe Harbor&rdquo; agreement, whereby
American companies that ascribe to seven principles could do business with-
out fear of European sanctions (Harvey and Verska 2001; Carlson 2001).
Many American companies did not sign this agreement because it would still
require full notification of customers whenever their data are being processed
and for what purpose, and European customers could forbid specific analy-
ses. However, in 2001, Microsoft signed onto Safe Harbor (Lucas 2001) and
by 2005, 400 US companies had followed.
</p>
<p>While the Safe Harbor system seems to be in place, as recently as
2005, the European Commission complained to the USA that its compa-
nies were not fully complying, and urged the US Department of Com-
merce to enforce the agreement fully (Swartz 2005). A complete de-
scription of the Safe Harbor agreement is available at http://www.
export.gov/safeharbor/safeharbordocuments.htm. While it is a relaxation of
the European Directive, it still has several strong requirements, including
that (1) companies notify European consumers about the purposes for which
it collects and uses their data, (2) if the company wishes to disclose data to
a third party, consumers must have the right to opt out of any disclosure
to a third party, or out of any use other than that originally notified, and
(3) also must have access to the personal information companies hold on
them (with the exception when the &ldquo;expense of providing access would be
disproportionate to the risks to the individual&rsquo;s privacy&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Clearly this is a regulatory issue in flux. There are many questions that
will undoubtedly be resolved over the next few years. For example, if a cat-
aloger obtains a list from a European company (assuming the consumer has
consented), does the cataloger have to inform the consumer each time he or
she is included in a predictive model?!? What are reasonable costs of pro-
viding consumers access to their data? If one division of a company obtains
data, say the magazine division of AOL/Time Warner, would the magazine
division need permission from the consumer in order for AOL to use the
data? Finally, will the Safe Harbor agreement, or even its more highly reg-
ulatory European Directive parent, become law for transactions within the
USA?
</p>
<p>In addition to the European Directive and Safe Harbor agreement,
there have been some specific laws passed in the USA pertaining to
data privacy. Following is a brief summary of four significant laws (see</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>90 4 Customer Privacy and Database Marketing
</p>
<p>also Goldstein and Lee 2005; for a summary of additional laws, see
http://www.consumerprivacyguide.org/law/):
</p>
<p>&bull; The CAN-SPAM Act: This applies to commercial e-mail messages used for
direct marketing (Dixon 2005). It requires that firms accurately identify
the sender of the message, provide a clear mechanism for the customer
to opt-out, and make clear that the message is an advertisement or a
solicitation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA): Protects the pri-
vacy of children with regard to the Internet (http://www. consumerpri-
vacyguide.org/law/). The law requires websites that cater to children 12
and under to inform parents as to their information practices and obtain
parent consent before collecting personal information from children. It also
allows parents to review and correct information the website might have
collected about their children.
</p>
<p>&bull; Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act (GLB): Regulates the
sharing of customer information in the domain of financial products and
services (http://www.consumerprivacyguide.org/law/). It informs cus-
tomers about the privacy policies of financial companies, and gives cus-
tomers opt-out privileges over how financial companies share financial in-
formation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): The
HIPAA Act of 1996 and subsequent regulations govern patient medical in-
formation, covering three main areas: privacy (e.g., when patient consent is
needed to release medical records, when patients can access their records,
etc.), security (protecting the confidentiality of data in electronic networks
and transmissions, and transactions (standards for content and format of
medical information when shared between health insurers, providers, and
other health organizations) (Speers et al. 2004).
</p>
<p>One can see elements of the European Directive incorporated in these laws.
For example, they emphasize clearly informing customers of privacy policies
(if not actual use of the data) and the right to opt-out and patient consent.
</p>
<p>An additional regulatory step taken in the USA is the National
Do-Not-Call Registry (www.donotcall.gov). Citizens can sign up and as a
result cannot be called for many telemarketing purposes. There are some
obvious exceptions &ndash; calls that are for survey purposes, political campaigns,
and charities. In addition, the registry allows calls from companies with whom
the customer has an existing relationship. This would appear to favor large
companies, since they have more customers they could call. One might argue
this decreases competition. For example, if a customer has a cell-phone con-
tract with Verizon, Verizon can call him or her to cross-sell services or adjust
the contract. This in turn gives Verizon more monopoly power over the cus-
tomer, which enables higher prices. Whether this is in fact a consequence of
the do-not-call registry is of course conjecture, but it is an important consid-
eration and illustrates the potentially subtle economic impact of all privacy
regulations.</p>

<p>4.4 Potential Solutions to Privacy Concerns 91
</p>
<p>4.4 Potential Solutions to Privacy Concerns
</p>
<p>In this section, we review steps for addressing the privacy concerns listed in
Fig. 4.1. Table 4.1 shows which steps might address each concern. We also
discuss what the net effect of each step might be on the consequences of
privacy concerns.
</p>
<p>4.4.1 Software Solutions
</p>
<p>A number of software solutions have been proposed to ensure customer pri-
vacy. Software is available that allows companies to take into account cus-
tomer privacy preferences when marketing to their customers (Maselli et al.
2001). The software also allows sensitive data such as financial and credit in-
formation to be linked via a user ID but not to a specific name and address.
As a result, very few people in the company would be able to associate a
particular name with sensitive data. Software is also being developed to en-
able data mining of data owned by different organizations without the data
actually having to be shared (Kantarcioglu and Clifton 2004).
</p>
<p>A host of software solutions have been developed specifically for the Web
and e-commerce (Turner and Dasgupta 2003). For example &ldquo;anonymizers&rdquo;
provide customers with the ability shield their computer&rsquo;s IP address, or pro-
vide a new IP address each log in, so that the company cannot use cookies to
record the customer&rsquo;s transactions. In fact, Hoffman et al. (1999) recommend
that companies allow customers to be anonymous or &ldquo;pseudo-anonymous&rdquo;,
although they still need to be addressable in order to conduct database mar-
keting. There are also tools the customer can use to block certain e-mails,
counter the placement of cookies, or the customer can simply delete cookies.
</p>
<p>In summary, software can address privacy concerns pertaining to data
security, secretive data collection, third-party access, and fears of violation.
One possible benefit is that ethical dilemmas can be avoiding by distancing
managers from the data. For example, they would no longer have access to
personally identifiable information. To the extent that companies use software
to integrate customer privacy preferences with their marketing efforts, it can
also diminish junk mail and spam and the &ldquo;none-of-your-business&rdquo; attitude.
If customers interpret a company&rsquo;s use of sophisticated privacy software as a
cue that the company cared about the customer, they might be more receptive
to its marketing efforts. While these benefits are uncertain, it is certain that
software and software maintenance is always expensive.
</p>
<p>4.4.2 Regulation
</p>
<p>Regulation can be thought of as a continuum from no regulation to self-
regulation to government regulation (Milberg et al. 1995).</p>

<p>4.4 Potential Solutions to Privacy Concerns 93
</p>
<p>4.4.2.1 Government Regulation
</p>
<p>Regulations such as the European Directive and the other initiatives discussed
in Sect. 4.3.3 can address many privacy concerns, including data security, se-
cretive data collection, junk mail and spam, third-party access, and none-of-
your-business attitudes. For example, the European Directive includes pro-
visions on third-party access and informing customers what data are being
collected. The CAN-SPAM Act curtails spam. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Fi-
nancial Modernization Act (GLB) regulates sharing of financial information
among companies. The Do-Not-Call Registry alleviates concerns about un-
wanted telephone solicitations. Government regulation in the USA focuses
especially on the privacy of truly sensitive data, such as medical information
(HIPAA), financial data (GLB), and children&rsquo;s information (COPPA).
</p>
<p>Government regulation provides an easy &ldquo;out&rdquo; on ethical issues, e.g.,
&ldquo;What we did was legal under the Such-and-Such Act.&rdquo; However, govern-
ment regulation is costly in that it often includes compliance monitoring,
which can be expensive both for the government and for firms. Whether the
benefits of regulation result in higher sales and profits depends on how cus-
tomers interpret the regulations. If customers view regulations as addressing
their fears so they can do business with companies and not be concerned
about privacy, customers might be more receptive to firms&rsquo; marketing ef-
forts. The key unanswered question is, does government regulation increase
trust (Turner and Dasgupta 2003)?
</p>
<p>4.4.2.2 Self-Regulation
</p>
<p>Self-regulation often consists of standards set by an industry trade organiza-
tion and adhered to by its members. A prime example is the Direct Marketing
Association&rsquo;s &ldquo;Privacy Promise&rdquo; (Direct Marketing Association 2007). This
contains four key provisions: (1) provide annual notice of the customer&rsquo;s right
to opt out of third-party information exchanges, (2) honor customer requests
to opt out of these exchanges, (3) accept customer requests that they be
added to in-house &ldquo;suppression&rdquo; files &ndash; lists of customers that are not to be
contacted by the company, (4) use the DMA&rsquo;s Mail Preference, e-Mail Pref-
erence, and Telephone Preference Service lists to weed out prospects who do
not wish to be contacted.
</p>
<p>Another example of self-regulation is the Platform for Privacy Preferences
(P3P) initiative. P3P was developed and recommended for company adoption
by the World Wide Web Consortium (WC3) in 2002 (Computer and Internet
Lawyer 2002). P3P offers the capability for the Internet customer to access
the website&rsquo;s privacy policy in a standard format and compare to his or her
own preferences (Matlis 2002; Grimm and Rossnagel 2000).
</p>
<p>This type of self-regulation can allay the same customer fears that gov-
ernment regulation addresses. The problem however is whether customers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>94 4 Customer Privacy and Database Marketing
</p>
<p>perceive self-regulation to be as effective. For example, while all DMA mem-
ber companies sign a statement agreeing to the Privacy Promise as part of
their membership, identify a Privacy Promise contact person, and re-affirm
compliance each year, customers may be concerned about whether the DMA
monitors compliance. P3P has no compliance mechanism (Matlis 2002). As a
result, self-regulation is less costly, but its effectiveness depends on whether
customers are aware of it and believe it works.
</p>
<p>4.4.3 Permission Marketing
</p>
<p>Permission marketing (also called &ldquo;permission-based marketing&rdquo;) refers to
obtaining the customer&rsquo;s consent before initiating database marketing efforts
(see Peppers and Rogers 2004b). The main benefit of permission marketing
is to make clear the exchange proposition: the company wants to collect data
on the customer and in return will use the data to personalize products and
offers. Permission marketing should also address customer fears of secretive
data collection, junk mail and spam, third-party access, and feelings of none-
of-your-business and violation.
</p>
<p>If permission marketing delivers on its promise, targeting can be more
efficient. First, the customers who do not want to participate in permission
marketing probably would be low responders anyway. Customers who directly
permit database marketing messages probably are more apt to respond to
them (Godin 1997). Second is that the customer presumably would allow the
collection of a lot of data. Permission marketing is also ethical in that the
customer has full information on the system, although it may increase costs
in terms of gaining and recording the permission. A key question is whether
sales and profits increase under permission marketing. To the extent that
targeting efficiency is higher, profitability in the sense of ROI should increase.
But whether absolute profits increase depends on how many customers agree
to participate. It is quite possible that under permission marketing, the firm
is left with a lucrative but small number of customers with whom it can
undertake database marketing.
</p>
<p>A central issue of permission marketing is the format of soliciting cus-
tomers, i.e., how to &ldquo;pop the question&rdquo; of whether they wish to participate.
There are two basic considerations in posing this question: (1) the framing of
the request, which can be either positive &ldquo;I wish to participate&rdquo; or negative
&ldquo;I wish not to participate&rdquo;, and (2) the default action assumed, which can
be &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;no&rdquo;, or neither. For example, if the question is framed, &ldquo;I wish to
participate&rdquo; and a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; box is checked, the customer is participating unless
he or she opts-out by checking the &ldquo;no&rdquo; box. Opt-in can therefore be defined
as when the customer decides to participate either by default or by proac-
tively saying yes. Opt-out can be defined as when the customer decides not
to participate, either by default or by proactively saying no.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.4 Potential Solutions to Privacy Concerns 95
</p>
<p>Bellman et al. (2001) investigated the premise that customers would re-
spond in the direction that required the least effort, following the path of
least resistance. They examined two factors in a controlled experiment: (1)
positive versus negative framing of the solicitation (&ldquo;I want to participate&rdquo;
versus &ldquo;I do not want to participate&rdquo;) and (2) whether the default answer
indicated participation, no participation, or neither.
</p>
<p>The authors conducted two experiments. The first was to investigate just
the framing. They asked 134 Internet users whether they wanted to receive
surveys about health issues. The question was framed in two ways: (1) the
statement &ldquo;Notify me about more health surveys&rdquo; appeared and the customer
had to proactively check a box in order to participate (opt-in presentation);
(2) the statement &ldquo;Do not notify me about more health surveys&rdquo; appeared
and the customer had to proactively check a box in order not to participate
(opt-out presentation). The authors found that 48.2% participated under the
opt-in format, while 96.3% participated under the opt-out format.
</p>
<p>In the second experiment, Bellman et al. combined question framing with
default box-checking. There were two factors in the experiment: framing of
the question and action requirements in terms of box-checking. The framing
question was asked in two ways: &ldquo;Notify me about future health surveys&rdquo;
(positive framing) or &ldquo;Do not notify me about future health surveys&rdquo; (neg-
ative framing). The box checking could either be so that the null was to
participate, not participate, or neither (box not checked). So for example
the statement &ldquo;Notify me about future health surveys&rdquo; with the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; box
checked would be a positive frame with the default being opt-in.
</p>
<p>The results, depicted in Fig. 4.6, showed that positive framing and the no-
action default increased participation rates. Figure 4.6 shows that if the cus-
tomer saw the statement &ldquo;Notify me about more health surveys&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; box was checked rather than the &ldquo;no&rdquo; box, 89.2% would participate.
That is, only 11.8% would uncheck the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; box and check &ldquo;no.&rdquo; On the
other extreme, if the wording was negative, &ldquo;Do not notify me about more
health surveys&rdquo; and the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; box was checked, indicating the customer would
have to press &ldquo;no&rdquo; in order to opt-in, only 44.2% opted in.
</p>
<p>Bellman et al.&rsquo;s work is important because it shows the format of how
customers are solicited for permission marketing is crucial for how many
customers sign up. Wording the question in a positive way (&ldquo;I want to par-
ticipate&rdquo;) and having a yes box checked, can double participation rates over
wording the question in a negative way (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to participate&rdquo;) and
having a yes box checked for that. Interestingly, with a positive frame, the
default checking of the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; box does not seem crucial. As Fig. 4.6 shows,
wording the question positively yields 88.5% participation even if no box is
checked, whereas asking the same question and checking the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; box as a
default adds only slightly, yielding a participation rate of 89.2%.
</p>
<p>A crucial next question is whether &ldquo;manipulating&rdquo; the customer into par-
ticipating influences further response to the direct marketing offers to fol-
low. That is, perhaps positive wording with a yes default yields the most</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>96 4 Customer Privacy and Database Marketing
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.6 Customer decisions to participate in permission marketing as a function of fram-
ing and default action. (a) Positive frame means the solicitation was worded &ldquo;Notify me
about more health surveys&rdquo;; negative frame means the solicitation was worded &ldquo;Do NOT
notify me about more health surveys. (b) &ldquo;No is default&rdquo; means the box was checked that
would indicate not to participate. &ldquo;Yes is default&rdquo; means the box was checked that would
indicate participate. &ldquo;Neither&rdquo; means that neither box was checked (From Bellman et al.
2001).
</p>
<p>customers, but many customers were essentially defaulted into participation,
and they won&rsquo;t respond well to future direct marketing efforts. Whereas
the customers who saw a negative wording with a default indicating non-
participation had to take action in order to participate, and hence might be
better responders further down the line. This is an important area for future
investigation.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of permission marketing is the need for companies to ed-
ucate the customer &ndash; to spell out exactly what CRM is, and why the trade
of privacy for database marketing is worth it. Customers seem to accept
that financial institutions such as banks need to know their credit history.
The view is that free flow of information lowers risk and keeps interest rates
down. As a result, it helps the economy. The same argument needs to be
made regarding other products &ndash; the free flow of information helps compa-
nies keep their marketing costs down, tailor appropriate services, and target
price discounts. Customers need to &ldquo;buy into&rdquo; this notion and be willing to
provide the data to make it happen &ndash; on a permission basis. In summary, in
order for permission marketing to be profitable, it needs to be marketed to
the customer.
</p>
<p>4.4.4 Customer Data Ownership
</p>
<p>The aim of customer data ownership is to grant the customer control of his or
her data. There are two ways this can be done. First is to provide customers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.4 Potential Solutions to Privacy Concerns 97
</p>
<p>with access to their data and the right to change it (Zwick and Dholakia
2004). Cespedes and Smith (1993) early-on recommended consumer access to
and control over their information. Zwick and Dholakia mention Amazon.com
as a case in point, where customers can learn the reasons for recommenda-
tions Amazon makes, and update or add to their preference data in order
to improve the quality of these recommendations. This essentially makes the
customer an active participant in the estimation of predictive models-the
data provided by the customer increase the accuracy of the recommendation
engine used by Amazon. So this form of customer data ownership should
result in higher response rates.
</p>
<p>Another form of customer data ownership is to let customers house their
data on their computers. Watson (2004) envisions a system of &ldquo;Customer-
Managed Interactions&rdquo; (CMI) whereby customer compile their own data on
preferences and behaviors regarding various product categories. They then
submit their data to companies and ask for tailored offers. For example,
the customer might maintain a database on his or her travel history, vaca-
tion preferences, etc. When it comes time to take a vacation, the customer
sends the data to various travel agencies who then compile a product rec-
ommendation and offer for the customer. Essentially, this system brings the
&ldquo;request-for-proposal&rdquo; (RFP) system used in government and B2B sectors to
the realm of database marketing.
</p>
<p>Data ownership addresses several concerns related to privacy. It ad-
dresses data security, secretive data collection, and none-of-your-business
and violation attitudes. In addition, it makes the nature of the exchange-
information for better service and more appropriate offers-more clear. One
concern is that providing customers with ownership of their data can
be costly. As with permission marketing, the question of whether it in-
creases sales and profits depends on how many customers want to partic-
ipate. It does appear to address the ethical concerns with database mar-
keting, because customers know exactly what data are being housed in the
company.
</p>
<p>4.4.5 Focus on Trust
</p>
<p>Bart et al. (2005) as well as other work discussed in Sect. 4.2 identify the
intermingling of trust and privacy. How exactly to combine trust and pri-
vacy in a database marketing context is a fertile area for future research
(e.g., see Peppers and Rogers 2005a). Trust addresses concerns about junk
mail and spam, third-party access, data security, and fears of violation. How-
ever, its main promise is to define the DBM exchange equation &ndash; the cus-
tomer trusts that by providing the company with better data, he or she
will be better served. The result, as indicated by Bart et al.&rsquo;s work, is
higher sales levels. Customers who trust companies tend to buy more from
them.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>98 4 Customer Privacy and Database Marketing
</p>
<p>Cespedes and Smith (1993) suggest a three-faceted approach to engen-
dering trust: (1) obtain clear and informed consent regarding the use of a
customer&rsquo;s data, (2) acknowledge corporate responsibility for information ac-
curacy and allow customers to access and edit their data, and (3) categorize
customers based on behaviors rather than personal characteristics. The third
recommendation is particularly interesting. Customers will perceive as fair a
system that provides heavy users with special offers, but less likely to believe
a system is fair if it provides customers of certain income groups with spe-
cial offers. Perhaps the key theme of Cespedes and Smith is transparency &ndash;
transparency in how the data are used, what data are collected, and access
to the data.
</p>
<p>Bart et al&rsquo;s (2005) rating scales for privacy involve transparency, re-
flected in phrases such as &ldquo;easy to understand&rdquo; and &ldquo;clearly explains.&rdquo; The
fact that this measure links so strongly to trust shows that transparency
is crucial for establishing trust. Our review in Sect. 4.3.1 suggests current
practice entails vaguely worded privacy policies. One possibility would be
for companies to adopt a standard format for stating policies that makes
clear where the company stands on the three crucial issues: what data are
collected, do third parties have access to the data, and can the customer
opt-out.
</p>
<p>Additional recommendations for engendering trust include: make it part
of the corporate culture; engender the attitude among the entire company
that they need to do all that&rsquo;s possible, not merely all that is required,
to ensure customer privacy (Peppers and Rogers 2005b); and publicize
customer trust ratings obtained via surveys &ndash; e.g., a recent survey found
eBay, P&amp;G, Amazon, and HP among the most trusted companies (McClure
2004).
</p>
<p>4.4.6 Top Management Support
</p>
<p>The European Directive requires companies to create top management posi-
tions and empower the occupiers of these positions to ensure privacy within
their company. It appears that more and more US companies are creating the
position of Chief Privacy Officer (Clampet 2005b). For example, the CPO at
Pfizer is needed simply to deal with the regulatory environment created by
HIPAA (Corr 2004).
</p>
<p>Top management support potentially can address all privacy concerns,
because top management can enhance the implementation of software, com-
pliance with government and self-regulation, permission marketing, data
ownership, and taking the steps to engender trust. Milberg et al. (2000)
measure &ldquo;corporate privacy management environment&rdquo; using a number of
items, including &ldquo;how important to the senior management of your or-
ganization is information privacy?&rdquo; They find that the corporate privacy
management environment is negatively associated with whether managers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.4 Potential Solutions to Privacy Concerns 99
</p>
<p>perceive privacy problems within the company. So at least company
executives believe that top management support decreases privacy con-
cerns. However, further research is needed to see whether customers see this
link.
</p>
<p>While the above suggests that top management support can address con-
cerns, it is costly in that it increases personnel costs, and raises concerns about
organizational bureaucracy. It hopefully would help resolve ethical dilemmas,
because the CPO could make these issues more salient and more openly dis-
cussed within the company.
</p>
<p>4.4.7 Privacy as Profit Maximization
</p>
<p>One view is that the customer database is a competitive advantage for many
companies, because it teaches them things about customers that no other
companies know, and hence enables them to serve them better. It therefore
behooves companies to protect this core competence by not sharing informa-
tion.
</p>
<p>Chen et al. (2001) present a more nuanced viewpoint, that a moderate
level of sharing customer data may be a profitable equilibrium in a compet-
itive environment. Chen et al. examine the case where companies vary in
their abilities to target customers. Chen et al. express this as knowing brand
preference and willingness to pay &ndash; their theory is about targeting in terms
of price. But the general point is that an important industry capability is
how much different companies know about different customers. A main find-
ing of Chen et al. is that industry profits are maximized when targeting is
imperfect, i.e., when companies do not know the preferences of all customers.
Chen et al. show that when companies do not know much about customers,
they should share information to increase profits. But at a certain point this
becomes self-defeating because extensively shared customer information pro-
motes price competition (see Fig. 4.2, p. 31 of Chen et al.).
</p>
<p>In summary, Chen et al. alleviate the fear that firms will share infor-
mation without bounds. However, they would advocate a balanced sharing
of information because &ldquo;when the achievable targetability in an industry is
low, it is important to share customer information. However, it behooves
firms in an industry to develop self-regulations at an early stage to pro-
tect customer privacy so as to ensure win-win competition in the industry&rdquo;
(pp. 36&ndash;37).
</p>
<p>Another viewpoint of privacy as profit maximization is that privacy is a
company attribute and rating higher on that attribute increases sales and loy-
alty. In the words of Peter Cullen, CPO of Royal Bank, quoted in Thibodeau
(2002), privacy &ldquo;is one of the key drivers of a customer&rsquo;s level of commitment
and has a significant contribution to overall demand,&rdquo; and &ldquo;plays a measur-
able part in how customers decide [to] purchase products and services from
us. It brings us more share of the customer&rsquo;s wallet.&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>100 4 Customer Privacy and Database Marketing
</p>
<p>4.5 Summary and Avenues for Research
</p>
<p>In this chapter we have reviewed the nature of the privacy &ldquo;problem,&rdquo; the
consumer perspective on privacy, current industry practices, and potential
solutions to the problem. Some of our major conclusions are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Privacy is multi-dimensional. It ranges from customer feelings of violation
to inequitable exchange to a reluctance to have their data transmitted
to third parties. The implication is that any measurement of consumer
perceptions of privacy needs to be multi-dimensional, and any solutions to
privacy concerns must address several dimensions (see Table 4.1).
</p>
<p>&bull; Negative consumer attitudes toward privacy appear to decrease sales. The
evidence comes from three studies: George (2002) found that privacy at-
titudes influenced Internet purchase intent, Verhoef et al. (2007) found
that privacy attitudes decreased use of the Internet as a sales channel,
and Bart et al. (2005) found that privacy concerns lead to lower trust and
lower trust in turn leads to lower sales.
</p>
<p>&bull; Companies communicate their privacy policies. This communication takes
place at least on the web, and policies vary in terms of opt-in/opt-out/no
option for data collection, the type of data collected, and whether the data
is shared with third parties. The statements are often difficult to interpret
although there seems to be a clear tendency for opt-out rather than opt-in,
and providing no option at all is more common than opt-in.
</p>
<p>&bull; There is an active market for sharing customer data. This occurs through
the direct sale of lists, customer list exchanges, and third party collectors
of customer data. Customer concerns regarding the sharing of data are
well-founded.
</p>
<p>&bull; There is a growing regulatory environment with respect to privacy.
Europe has taken the lead in adopting a strict, highly protective pol-
icy, and American companies have scrambled to comply with it. The USA
is less regulated, but there are specific laws with regard to children, the
financial industry, the health care industry, and e-mail marketing. The
indications are that more laws will be forthcoming.
</p>
<p>&bull; There are several potential ways to address customer privacy concerns.
Including software solutions, government and self-regulation, permission
marketing, customer data ownership, focus on trust, top management sup-
port, and privacy as a profit-maximizing strategy. These solutions collec-
tively can address all customer privacy concerns. They hence offer ways to
improve sales levels and ensure efficient targeting, in an ethical way.
</p>
<p>The chapter suggests several areas for further research:
</p>
<p>&bull; Which privacy dimensions are most crucial? How does this vary by indus-
try and customer? Are there customer segments?
</p>
<p>&bull; More evidence on how privacy concerns detract from commerce: We do
have some evidence summarized above that suggests privacy concerns</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4.5 Summary and Avenues for Research 101
</p>
<p>decrease economic activity, but we need new studies especially with re-
gard to the Internet.
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the impact of regulation? Is regulation a friend or foe of database
marketing? Which is more effective, government or self-regulation, and
under what conditions? A fascinating question is whether the do-not-call
registry has provided advantages to large firms with large customer bases.
</p>
<p>&bull; What would be the impact of a more transparent information environment
for the customer? If customers knew exactly what data were collected, ex-
actly how they were used, and what decisions were made as a result, would
this enhance participation in database marketing or cause too many cus-
tomers to opt out? This is a crucial issue because probably the underlying
fear of many CRM executives is that complete transparency, coupled with
opt-in, would result in very little opt-in.
</p>
<p>&bull; Does customer experience with database marketing diminish or enhance
concerns for information privacy? This is a very important issue because if
experience diminishes concern, the privacy issue might possibly melt away
over time. This issue has been studied with respect to the Internet. The
evidence seems to be that experience diminishes concerns (George 2002;
Bellman et al. 2004). However, this issue warrants deeper investigation.
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the effectiveness of the various solutions proposed for address-
ing privacy? Are some of the customer data ownership proposals feasi-

<p>In conclusion, privacy is an issue in flux and difficult to research, but it gets
at the core of whether the database marketing premise of exchange &ndash; data

<p>Customer Lifetime Value:
Fundamentals
</p>
<p>Abstract Customer lifetime value (LTV) is one of the cornerstones of data-
base marketing. It is the metric by which we quantify the customer&rsquo;s long-
term value to the firm. This chapter focuses on the fundamental methods
for calculating lifetime value, centering on &ldquo;simple retention models&rdquo; and
&ldquo;migration models.&rdquo; We present a general approach to calculating LTV us-
ing these models, and illustrate with specific examples. We also discuss the
particular case of calculating LTV when customer attrition is unobserved.
</p>
<p>5.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Marketing needs to develop key metrics if it wants to become more relevant
to top management. The commonly used marketing metrics are sales and
market share but these measures are &ldquo;dated&rdquo;. They are aggregate &ldquo;30,000
feet&rdquo; measures and do not provide the level of insight modern executives need
to manage their businesses. This chapter focuses on a relatively new metric:
lifetime value of a customer (LTV).
</p>
<p>LTV has two main applications: (1) to diagnose the health of a business and
(2) to assist in making tactical decisions. LTV provides a longer-run economic
view of the customer and generates diagnostics based on the parameters that
determine it: retention rates, sales per customer, and costs. LTV, linked with
customer acquisition rates and expenditures, quantifies the long-term prof-
itability of the firm. A firm cannot reduce customer acquisition investment
without a warning signal going off: the number of newly acquired customers
multiplied by their LTV would decline, indicating a long-term decline in total
company profit.
</p>
<p>LTV&rsquo;s tactical applications include determining how much a firm can in-
vest to acquire customers and deciding how much service to offer a given cus-
tomer. For example, a bank might decide that high-LTV customers should
receive better services (e.g., a personal representative and no service fees for
bank checking accounts).

<p>106 5 Customer Lifetime Value: Fundamentals
</p>
<p>This chapter covers the fundamentals of calculating LTV. Chapter 6 covers
challenging issues in computing LTV and Chapter 7 provides LTV applica-
tions.
</p>
<p>5.1.1 Definition of Lifetime Value of a Customer
</p>
<p>The definition we will use for the lifetime value of a customer (LTV) is:
</p>
<p>The net present value of the profits linked to a specific customer once the customer has been
acquired, after subtracting incremental costs associated with marketing, selling, production
and servicing over the customer&rsquo;s lifetime.
</p>
<p>There are a number of important issues implied in this definition. The firm
needs to: (1) forecast future sales of a customer; (2) compute incremental
costs per customer; and (3) determine the relevant discount rate to use in the
present value calculation. Note also that we do not include acquisition costs
as part of lifetime value. However, we often display customer acquisition
cost alongside customer LTV. In this way, we gain insight on whether an
unprofitable customer (for whom LTV minus acquisition cost is negative) is
due to high acquisition cost or low LTV. Formally, we refer to LTV minus
acquisition cost as &ldquo;Customer Equity&rdquo; (Blattberg et al. 2001).
</p>
<p>5.1.2 A Simple Example of Calculating
Customer Lifetime Value
</p>
<p>Assume a firm spends $2.00 for mailing and printing a catalog which is sent
to 1,000,000 prospects. The response rate to the mailing is 1%. Prospects
who become customers spend $200 per year as long as they are still active
customers. A customer has a probability of &ldquo;attriting&rdquo; (&ldquo;churning&rdquo;)1 each
year of 20%. If a customer attrites, he or she ceases to be a customer and never
returns. The firm also spends $20 per year in marketing (catalogs and service)
to each active customer. The firm has a gross margin of 50% and uses a
discount rate of 15%.
</p>
<p>Table 5.1a shows the computations for the LTV of the customer just de-
scribed along with the average acquisition cost per customer. We see that
the acquisition cost is less than the LTV and so the firm should invest in
acquiring this customer.
</p>
<p>This example highlights some of the critical information required to com-
pute LTV. Table 5.2 summarizes these issues and where they are covered.
</p>
<p>1 Throughout this chapter and book we will use attrite and churn interchangeably.</p>

<p>aThe survival rate is the probability the customer is still a customer in a given year. In
this case the survival rate in year t is 0.8t&minus;1. This is because the customer has a 0.2
probability of attriting each year; hence a retention rate of 0.8, and we assume the
retention rate is constant over time.
bDiscount multiplier = 1/(1 + discount rate)(Year&minus;1)

<p>108 5 Customer Lifetime Value: Fundamentals
</p>
<p>5.2 Mathematical Formulation of LTV
</p>
<p>Lifetime value can be stated as:
</p>
<p>LTV =
&infin;&sum;
t=1
</p>
<p>E[Ṽt]
(1 + δ)t&minus;1
</p>
<p>(5.1)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Ṽt = a random variable representing the customer&rsquo;s net profit contribution
during time t.
</p>
<p>δ = the discount rate per time unit t.
</p>
<p>Profit contribution over time is uncertain; therefore LTV is the expected
net present value of future profit contributions. The assumptions made in
quantifying these uncertain returns determine LTV. For simplicity we do not
include a customer subscript in Equation 5.1. Ideally, the calculation should
be made at the customer level, but data might not be available to estimate the
required parameters on a per customer basis. Therefore, LTV calculations are
often made for the &ldquo;average&rdquo; customer using average parameters. However,
calculating the LTV of a group of customers assuming an average retention
rate will technically not yield the correct average LTV. The reason is that the
mean of a function of a variable &ldquo;X&rdquo; does not equal the function evaluated
at the mean of X (i.e., E[f(X)] �= f(E[X])). The correct way to calculate
the average LTV of a group of customers is to determine each customer&rsquo;s
parameters (e.g., retention rate), use them to calculate each customer&rsquo;s LTV,
and then average. For this reason, even if the firm only needed to compute
LTV at the segment level, it is preferable to compute individual LTV values
and then average at the segment level.
</p>
<p>Larger discount factors result in future profit being less &ldquo;important&rdquo; to
the firm. Despite the importance of the discount factor in the calculation of
LTV, there is very little systematic work on what value to use. In practice,
one sees annual discount factors varying between 10% (δ = 0.10) and 20%
(δ = 0.20), usually with little justification. We cover this issue in depth in
Chapter 6.
</p>
<p>E(Ṽt) can be decomposed into revenues and costs. Specifically, Ṽt = R̃t&minus;Ct
where R̃t is the revenue generated by the customer in period t and Ct includes
costs of goods, marketing and servicing. Little has been written about how
to compute relevant costs for LTV models. For example, one very important
issue is how to treat &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; versus &ldquo;variable&rdquo; costs. This topic will be covered
in Chapter 6. We assume future costs are known, but revenues are random, so
to compute expected lifetime value, we need to compute E(R̃t), expected rev-
enue. To do this, we multiply the probability the customer is retained through
period t (the survival rate in Table 5.1a) times the expected revenue gener-
ated during the period, given the customer has survived. Formally, E(R̃t) =
P (Survive until period t) &middot;E(R̃t|Survive until period t) = St &middot;E(D̃t) where</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.3 The Two Primary LTV Models: Simple Retention and Migration 109
</p>
<p>St is the probability the customer survives until period t, and D̃t is a random
variable equal to the revenue the customer generates during period t, given
the customer survives until then.
</p>
<p>Hazard models can be used to estimate St, and regression models can
be used to estimate E(D̃t). A significant challenge is to incorporate control
variables such as pricing and marketing contacts. We discuss these issues in
Chapters 6 and 28.
</p>
<p>5.3 The Two Primary LTV Models: Simple
Retention and Migration
</p>
<p>There are two primary models used to calculate LTV &ndash; simple retention and
migration (Dwyer 1989; Berger and Nasr 1998). Simple retention models as-
sume once the customer has attrited, the customer is lost to the company.
Table 5.1a assumes a simple retention model. Migration models acknowledge
that customers might migrate in and out of being a customer during the
normal course of their lifetimes. Simple retention models are more applicable
for industries such as financial services, B2B businesses, magazine subscrip-
tions, and pharmaceutical drugs. Migration models are more applicable for
industries such as retailing, catalogs, and consumer packaged goods.
</p>
<p>5.3.1 Simple Retention Models
</p>
<p>5.3.1.1 Calculating the Retention Rate by Direct Observation
</p>
<p>As Table 5.1a illustrates, one of the most important parameters for the simple
retention model is the retention rate, the probability the customer remains
with the company, given the customer has not yet left the company. The
simplest way to calculate a retention rate is by direct observation. Using its
customer base for year 1, the firm can determine what percentage of these
customers remained with the company in year 2. The resulting retention rate
is often assumed to apply for all periods. The computation can be made
more detailed by segmenting customers based on how long they have been
customers or by various other demographic or behavioral variables.
</p>
<p>The method just described is perhaps the most common way that retention
rates are calculated in the real world. The problem is that they assume re-
tention rates from the past will hold up in the future. They also provide little
flexibility to calculate the probability customer will still be with the firm 11/2
years from now, or to calculate customer-level retention rates. Overcoming
these deficiencies requires a model for which hazard models provide an ideal
approach (see Chapter 15 for more detailed discussion of hazard models).</p>

<p>5.3 The Two Primary LTV Models: Simple Retention and Migration 111
</p>
<p>5.3.1.2 Using Hazard Models to Calculate LTV
for a Simple Retention Model
</p>
<p>Hazard models are used to compute St, the probability that a customer is
still alive at (survived to) time t. Let T̃ be a random variable representing
the time the customer attrites (dies) with probability density function f(t).
The probability of attrition is P(T̃ &lt; t) = F(t), where F(t) is the cumulative
distribution function: F(t) =
</p>
<p>&int; t
0
f(x)dx. The probability that a customer
</p>
<p>survives past time t is St = P(T̃ &ge; t) = 1&minus; F(t) =
&int;&infin;
t
</p>
<p>f(x)dx.
The hazard function is also very useful. It is the probability the customer
</p>
<p>attrites during the instantaneous period ∆t given the customer has remained
with the firm up to period t. It is defined as h(t) = f(t)S(t) . The hazard functions
can also be represented as h(t) = ddx logS(t). Thus for a given survival func-
tion, there is a one-to-one relationship with a corresponding hazard function.
</p>
<p>To show how the survival function is used in LTV calculations, we will
begin with a very simple distribution for survival rates, the exponential dis-
tribution, where f(t) = λe&minus;λt. The survival function for the exponential dis-
tribution is St = 1&minus; F(t) = e&minus;λt and the hazard function is h(t) = f(t)S(t) = λ.
This means that if the lifetime of the customer follows an exponential distri-
bution, the hazard is constant each period no matter how long the customer
survives.
</p>
<p>To make matters simpler, we will use the discrete version of the exponential
distribution, the geometric distribution with parameter h. The hazard for the
geometric distribution in any discrete time period is h and is constant. Let
r = 1 &minus; h which is the retention rate. The survival function for τ periods
after the initial period is rτ . The value of a customer up to period τ is&sum;τ
</p>
<p>t=1 r
t&minus;1(Rt&minus;Ct)/(1+δ)t&minus;1 where Rt is revenue, δ is the discount rate and
</p>
<p>Ct is cost in period t.
Table 5.3 shows the computation of expected profit for the geometric as-
</p>
<p>suming a hazard rate h per period and a retention rate each period of
r = 1 &minus; h. The table also shows the survival rate. The expected profit in
each period is the survival rate times the discounted profit per period, which
we assume to be known and constant. This case, where we assume constant re-
tention rate and profit contribution, can be calculated using a simple formula:
</p>
<p>LTV = (R&minus; C) 1 + δ
1 + δ &minus; r (5.2)
</p>
<p>where δ is the discount rate, r is the retention rate, and R and C are the
assumed known revenues and costs per period.2
</p>
<p>2 Assume revenues (R) and costs (C) are constant over time, and the discount factor is
δ. Then

</p>
<p>Figure 5.1 shows the relationship between LTV and the retention rate us-
ing Equation 5.2. The relationship is convex and increases significantly as
retention rate approaches one. This is the reason many authors argue small
increases in the retention rates have a significant impact on LTV. What they
do not include is the cost of changing the retention rate. It may be very costly
to increase it from 0.90 to 0.95.
</p>
<p>Other statistical distributions can be used to generate survival and hazard
functions. For example, if one believes that customers have declining haz-
ards, meaning that the longer the customers are with the firm, the lower the
probability of attrition, then a Weibull distribution with specific parameters
can be used. The Weibull distribution has a probability distribution function
(p.d.f) of:
</p>
<p>f(t) = λγ(λt)γ&minus;1e&minus;(λt)
γ
</p>
<p>(5.3)
</p>
<p>The survival and hazard functions for the Weibull are respectively:
</p>
<p>S(t) = e&minus;(λt)
γ
</p>
<p>(5.4a)
</p>
<p>h(t) = λγ(λt)γ&minus;1 (5.4b)
</p>
<p>The shape of the survival and hazard functions are determined by γ. If γ &lt; 1,
then the hazard function is decreasing over time, and if γ &gt; 1, then it is
increasing. If γ = 1, the Weibull become the exponential distribution with
constant hazard λ. Figure 5.2 plots the hazard function for γ = 0.7 and
γ = 1.3 (with λ = 0.3). The shape of the hazard is extremely useful for
database marketers because it tells the decision maker whether the risk of
customer attrition increases or decreases over time.

</p>
<p>Researchers should try to explain the shape of the hazard function. For
example, a decreasing hazard function may be due to heterogeneity across
customers in their preference for the product and may not be due to changing
hazard rates. Alternatively, as the customers uses the product or service, he
or she increases preference or satisfaction or is locked in and that causes the
decreasing hazard.
</p>
<p>One can always transform continuous into discrete distributions.3 Table 5.4
shows the results for a Weibull distribution with 10 years of data with γ = 0.7
and λ = 0.3. It shows a different pattern than one sees for a constant hazard
rate model. For example in year 2 the retention rate increases to 0.81. In year
3 it is 0.84. The retention rate is the key statistic for computing LTV. By
multiplying the retention rates over time, we compute the implied survival
rate, i.e., the probability the customer is still active. Multiplying this times
the $100 sales per year yields expected sales per year.
</p>
<p>Hazard models are a powerful tool for calculating lifetime value. They can
be used to calculate customer-specific LTV because they can be extended to
incorporate customer-level information such as demographics and marketing
variables (Chapter 15). They are flexible and can allow a constant or time-
varying retention rate. Hazard models can be estimated using commonly
available statistical packages. See Chapter 15, Seetharaman and Chintagunta
(2003), and Lawless (2003) for more details.
</p>
<p>A key issue that affects the use of hazard models for LTV computations is
that we may not know when a customer attrites. For many non-subscription
businesses, the firm cannot determine if the customer attrites. For example,
</p>
<p>3 It is often useful to use discrete distributions because continuous time distributions
frequently require numerical integration to compute LTV. It is easier to think of revenue
streams in discrete intervals as well.</p>

</p>
<p>Survival rates and Hazard rates are computed from Equations 5.4a, b. The estimated
</p>
<p>hazard is computed by taking the change in survival rate and dividing it by the average
</p>
<p>survival rate for a given row and the row above it. This can then be compared to the
</p>
<p>actual hazard rate computed from the model.
</p>
<p>The estimated retention rate is simply 1 &ndash; hazard rate which is computed from the
estimated hazard rate. The estimated survival rate is the estimated retention rates
multiplied up to the given point in time for which the survival rate is computed.
</p>
<p>The results show that the estimated hazard is very close to the actual hazard rate.
</p>
<p>a catalog company does not know when a customer has attrited. If the time
of attrition is not known, hazard models cannot be estimated. Later we will
discuss ways to incorporate the &ldquo;death&rdquo; process to estimate the probability
of attriting (Sect. 5.4).
</p>
<p>5.3.2 Migration Models
</p>
<p>5.3.2.1 The Basic Customer Migration Model for Calculating LTV
</p>
<p>The second common model for measuring LTV is the migration model, which
as we will see in the next section, models LTV as a Markov Chain. The term
migration model is used because the model allows customers to &ldquo;migrate&rdquo;
among different states. The most common way of defining states is in terms
of how recently the customer has bought from the company. This model</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.3 The Two Primary LTV Models: Simple Retention and Migration 115
</p>
<p>acknowledges, in contrast to the simple retention model, that the customer
might not purchase from the firm each period, but can skip one or more
periods and still come back to purchase.
</p>
<p>To operationalize this model, we define &ldquo;recency state j&rdquo; to mean that the
customer last bought from the company j periods ago. We assign customers
to recency states at the conclusion of each period. So if at the end of period
15 the customer is in recency state 2, that means the customer did not buy
in period 15 but bought in period 14. Recency state 1 would mean that the
customer bought in period 15. The key parameters that drive the migration
model are the &ldquo;recency probabilities&rdquo;4:
</p>
<p>pj = Probability the customer purchases in the current period, given that the
customer last purchased j periods ago, i.e., that the customer is classified
in recency state j at the end of the previous period (NR &ge; j &ge; 1).5
</p>
<p>The migration model reduces to the simple retention model if pj = 0 for
j &gt; 1 because then if the customer is not retained, he or she cannot purchase
again. We assume the recency probabilities do not change over time, i.e., we
have no time subscript for pj . This assumption could be relaxed at the cost
of added complexity.
</p>
<p>Table 5.5 illustrates the calculation of LTV using a migration model. We
have four recency states (NR = 4), labeled 1, 2, 3, and &ge;4. The state &ldquo;&ge;4&rdquo;
signifies that it has been four or more periods since the customer has pur-
chased. In Table 5.5, this customer has no chance of purchasing again &ndash; in
Markov chain terminology, state &ge;4 is an absorbing state. We have acquired
the customer in period 1. Therefore, the customer is classified in recency
state 1 at the end of period 1. The probability the customer purchases in
period 2 is p1 = 0.5. With probability 1 &minus; p1 = 0.5, the customer does
not purchase and hence moves to recency state 2 at the end of period 2.
To compute the probability the customer purchases in period 3, we calcu-
late P(customer in state 1) &times; P(Purchase|state 1) + P(customer in state
2) &times; P(Purchase|state 2) = 0.5 &times; 0.5 + 0.2 &times; 0.5 = 0.35. The general pat-
tern is that the customer moves to recency state 1 if he or she purchases
in that period, or slips one recency state if he or she does not. Note that
for the absorbing state &ge;4, we assume there is no chance the customer will
purchase again so the customer stays in that state. So for period 5, the
probability the customer is in state &ge;4 is P(Customer is in state &ge;4 in pe-
riod 4) + P(Customer does not purchase|Customer is in state 3 in period 4)
= 0.360 + (1&minus; 0.1) &times; 0.200 = 0.540.
</p>
<p>4 Note we generally follow the general development of Berger and Nasr in this section.
See also also Dwyer (1989) and Calciu and Salerno (2002).
</p>
<p>5 Technically there is no upper limit to how many periods ago the customer might have
purchased, but for computational purposes, we typically use an upper limit &ldquo;NR&rdquo;. NR =
&ldquo;&ge;5&rdquo; means that any customer who has not purchased in the past 5 or more periods
would be classified in recency state &ge;5.</p>

</p>
<p>Table 5.5 shows that the sum of discounted expected profit after 15 periods
is $230.74. One can see because of the declining values in later periods that
this is close to the ultimate long-term LTV but not exact. Carrying out the
calculation for 100 periods yields an LTV of $231.08.
</p>
<p>Figure 5.3 shows sensitivity analyses based on the example in Table 5.5.
The figure shows a convex relationship between recency probabilities p2 and
p3 and LTV. These relationships could help a firm evaluate whether it would
be worthwhile to attempt to induce customers who had not bought in say
three periods to purchase this period.
</p>
<p>Libai et al. (2002) describe a customer migration model for a European
retailer. The models they use place customers into segments. Segment mem-
bership is dynamic. The authors argue that one way to increase customer
equity is to increase the probability that a customer will move to a more
profitable segment. By identifying key differences between segments, the firm
can adjust the marketing and customer service mix for each segment. The
concepts described by Libai et al. have the potential to link marketing mix
actions to segment migration. The difficulty is creating the linkages. The au-
thors do not describe the exact modeling methods they use. This becomes
a research opportunity for academics and practitioners who have large cus-
tomer databases and can develop the relevant methodology.</p>

<p>5.3.2.2 Generalizing the Migration Model Using
a Markov Chain Framework
</p>
<p>Pfeifer and Carraway (2000) propose a Markov Chain framework that gen-
eralizes the calculations for the migration model. We use the same notation
for pj to signify the probability the customer purchases by the end of the
current period, given the customer is in recency state j at the end of the pre-
vious period. We also label the recency states R1,R2, . . . ,RNR. To simplify
the exposition, we assume as in Pfeifer and Carraway that there are three
possible (recency) states (NR = 3): bought last period (R1), bought two
periods ago (R2), and bought three or more periods ago (R3). The model
of customer migration can be represented as a Markov chain with a 3 &times; 3
transition probability matrix, P, as follows:
</p>
<p>Period t+ 1
R1 R2 R3
</p>
<p>P = Period t
R1
R2
R3
</p>
<p>⎡⎣p1 1&minus; p1 0p2 0 1&minus; p2
p3 0 1&minus; p3
</p>
<p>⎤⎦ (5.5)
Each element of P represents the probability the customer migrates from
one state to another in a single period. Consider a customer in state R1. The
customer will or will not purchase in the current period with probabilities
p1 and 1 &minus; p1 respectively. If the customer purchases, he or she remains in
R1. If not, the customer moves to R2. The customer in state R2 will or will</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>118 5 Customer Lifetime Value: Fundamentals
</p>
<p>not purchase at the current period with probabilities p2 and 1&minus; p2. Finally,
the customer in state R3 will or will not purchase at the current period with
probabilities p3 and 1&minus;p3. Some transitions have zero probability, such as R2
to R2. If a customer is in recency state R2, he or she will either not purchase
and go to recency state R3 or purchase and go to R1 but cannot stay in R2.
</p>
<p>Because of the property of the Markov Chain, we can easily calculate a
t-step (t periods from now) transition matrix; that is, the matrix of proba-
bilities of moving from one state to another after t periods. It is simply the
matrix product of t one-step transition matrices, Pt. The (i, j)th element
of the matrix Pt is the probability that the customer who begins at the ith
state and will be at the jth state t periods later.
</p>
<p>Assume that the firm earns MC if a customer purchases, and the firm
spendsM for a customer to repurchase. The profit vectorG can be written as:
</p>
<p>G =
</p>
<p>⎡⎣MC &minus;M&minus;M
&minus;M
</p>
<p>⎤⎦ (5.6)
The first row of G represents the profit contribution if the customer is in
state R1 (just purchased), the second row represents the profit contribution
if the customer is in state R2 (the customer did not purchase but the firm
spent M on marketing to the customer), etc. Let Π1 = the profit after one
period. Then,
</p>
<p>Π1 = PG =
</p>
<p>⎡⎣p1MC &minus;Mp2MC &minus;M
p3MC &minus;M
</p>
<p>⎤⎦ (5.7)
The vector of the expected profit is P2G after two periods, and PTG after T
periods. And the corresponding vector of the expected net present value that
considers the discount factor d per period is P1G/(1 + d) after one period,
P2G/(1+d)2 after two periods, andPTG/(1+d)T after T periods. Therefore,
the vector of the total net present value from the period 0 to the period T is:
</p>
<p>VT =
T&sum;
</p>
<p>t=0
</p>
<p>[(1 + d)&minus;1P]tG (5.8)
</p>
<p>Hence the vector of the total net present value for the infinite time horizon
becomes
</p>
<p>V&infin; = lim
T&rarr;&infin;
</p>
<p>VT = [I&minus; (1 + d)&minus;1P]&minus;1G (5.9)
</p>
<p>where I is the identity matrix. The vector in Equation 5.9 is of particular
interest because each element represents the expected lifetime value of a
customer starting in state R1,R2, etc. The first element of V&infin; is of partic-
ular interest &ndash; it is the long-term value of a customer who starts out in state</p>

<p>5.3 The Two Primary LTV Models: Simple Retention and Migration 119
</p>
<p>R1. This is the LTV of a just-acquired customer, because a just-acquired
customer starts off in state R1 (just purchased). The second element of V&infin; is
the net present value of a customer who we currently observe to be in state R2
(purchased two periods ago). In this way, we see that the Markov framework
is a generalization of the migration model presented in the previous section.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the connection between the &ldquo;brute force&rdquo; calculation in
Table 5.5 and the matrix calculation, note the recency probabilities
in Table 5.5 imply the following:
</p>
<p>P =
</p>
<p>⎡⎢⎢⎣
.5 .5 0 0
.2 0 .8 0
.1 0 0 .9
0 0 0 1
</p>
<p>⎤⎥⎥⎦ (5.10)
The matrix P is 4 &times; 4 because we have four states. The payoff matrix is
simple:
</p>
<p>G =
</p>
<p>⎡⎢⎢⎣
$100
$0
$0
$0
</p>
<p>⎤⎥⎥⎦ (5.11)
The customer contributes $100 if he or she purchases; else contributes $0, and
we are not considering any period-by-period marketing costs. To complete the
model, note that the discount rate in Table 5.5 is 10%. From Equation 5.9,
we therefore have:
</p>
<p>V&infin; =
</p>
<p>⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩

<p>As another example, assume a customer generates $40 marginal contribu-
tion (MC ) whenever a purchase is made, and the firm mails to the customer
unless the customer lapse to state &ge;4, in which case the firm knows the cus-
tomer will not purchase no matter what, so doesn&rsquo;t bother to mail a catalog.
The mailing costs are $4. The firm&rsquo;s discount rate is d = 0.2. The payoff
matrix, G, is then:
</p>
<p>G =
</p>
<p>⎡⎢⎢⎣
MC &minus;M
&minus;M

<p>Next suppose the transition matrix is defined as

<p>P =
</p>
<p>⎡⎢⎢⎣
.3 .7 0 0
.2 0 .8 0
.05 0 0 .95
0 0 0 1
</p>
<p>⎤⎥⎥⎦
This transition matrix implies that if the customer is state R1, he or she
has a 0.3 chance of purchasing. If the customer is in state R2, there is a 0.2
chance of a purchase but if the customer is in state R4, the customer is the
&ldquo;absorbing&rdquo; state &ldquo;&ge;4&rdquo; and has no chance of purchasing.
</p>
<p>Suppose we want to study the behavior of a new customer (in state R1)
to determine how likely the customer is to be in state R1 after four purchase
occasions? We can multiply the transition matrix three times and see what
the purchase pattern will be. For the period after the first purchase, we see
that:
</p>
<p>P2 =
</p>
<p>⎡⎢⎢⎣
.23 .21 .56 0
.10 .14 0 .76
.015 .035 0 .95

and after the 4th period,
</p>
<p>P4 =
</p>
<p>⎡⎢⎢⎣
.0823 .0973 .1288 .6916
.037 .0406 .056 .8664
.0070 .0080 .0084 .9766
0 0 0 1
</p>
<p>⎤⎥⎥⎦
The matrix shows that a customer who began in state R1 has a 0.0823 prob-
ability of being in R1 (having just made a purchase) 4 periods later.
</p>
<p>Another question that can be answered using the method just described
is that we can examine the expected present value for each initial state after
4 periods, which is:
</p>
<p>&prod;
4
</p>
<p>=
4&sum;
</p>
<p>i=0
</p>
<p>P iG
</p>

=
</p>
<p>⎡⎢⎢⎣
$49.40
$2.69
($1.98)
0
</p>
<p>⎤⎥⎥⎦ where P 0G = G
The interpretation of the 3rd row element of Π4 is that a customer beginning
in recency state 3 has a negative expected present value after 4 periods. The
firm should not mail individuals in this cell because the value is negative at
time 0.
</p>
<p>Pfeifer and Carraway show that the states do not have to be defined in
terms of recency. They can be defined in terms of recency plus frequency,
for example. In this case, R1 might represent a customer who just bought
and has bought once over the last year. R2 might represent a customer</p>

<p>who just bought and has bought twice over the last year. If we have four
recency states, each with four frequency states, the transition matrix will
be a 16 &times; 16, but the same machinery as described in Equations 5.6&ndash;5.9
would be applicable. Particularly interesting would be to experiment with
different marketing policies, which would change the values of the G vector.
Pfeifer and Carraway show how this might be done in the context of a catalog
manufacturer.
</p>
<p>In summary Pfeifer and Carraway&rsquo;s formulation of migration models as a
Markov chain is a valuable generalization. It provides a framework for ex-
tending the definition of customer states, and for experimenting with various
marketing policies. Their contribution is very practical and hence of value to
managers.
</p>
<p>5.4 LTV Models that Include Unobserved
Customer Attrition
</p>
<p>A series of LTV models have been developed that incorporate unobserved
attrition (Schmittlein et al. 1987; Fader et al. 2004, 2005). They derive results
such as the expected future number of remaining purchases or the customer&rsquo;s
expected remaining lifetime with the firm, given the customer&rsquo;s past purchase
history. These models therefore can be used to value customers in terms of
the future number of purchases, lifetime duration, or lifetime value.
</p>
<p>A fundamental notion in these models is the concept of whether the
customer is &ldquo;alive&rdquo; or &ldquo;dead.&rdquo; Customer attrition (or churn) is an impor-
tant concern for many companies (Chapter 24). In contractual settings, such
as subscriptions in the telecom, magazine, or cable industries, it is easy to
determine when customers have attrited &ndash; they do not renew their contract.
However, in many industries the customer has no written contract with the
company so attrition is unobserved. For example, catalog companies are
known to keep sending catalogs to customers who have not purchased in
several years. Perhaps those customers have attrited (churned) and sending
them catalogs is a fruitless investment. This issue is of prime importance to
non-contractual businesses such as travel services, restaurants, retail, health
care providers, and catalogers.
</p>
<p>Determining whether a customer is alive or dead would at first seem
trivial &ndash; if the customer has not bought in a long time, he or she has attrited.
However, what if the customer has an erratic, infrequent buying pattern?
Perhaps there is a hiatus in the customer&rsquo;s purchase pattern (e.g., when a
customer is on vacation or has changed jobs) and again will buy from the
firm without any remedial action.
</p>
<p>The models developed to date focus on four key phenomena:
</p>
<p>&bull; The number of purchases in a given time period.
&bull; Heterogeneity in the parameters of the purchase rate model.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>122 5 Customer Lifetime Value: Fundamentals
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer lifetime, i.e., how long the customer is alive.
&bull; Heterogeneity in the parameters governing the lifetime model.
</p>
<p>Table 5.6 shows how these phenomena are modeled. There are three
main models developed to date. Schmittleim et al. (1987) (SCM) and
Fader et al. (2005) (FHL) model purchases as a Poisson process, whereas
Fader et al. (2004) (FHB) model it as a Bernouli process. SCM model cus-
tomer lifetime as an exponential distribution, whereas FHL and FHB model
it as a geometric process. We will concentrate our discussion on SCM and
FHL.
</p>
<p>SCM&rsquo;s propose the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchase rate: While alive, each customer purchases according to a Poisson
process with parameter λ.
</p>
<p>&bull; Heterogeneity in purchase rate process: The parameter λ is distributed
across customers according to a gamma distribution with parameters r
and α, so that the mean λ is r/α and the variance is r/α2.
</p>
<p>&bull; Lifetimes: Each customer&rsquo;s lifetime follows an exponential distribution
with parameter &micro;. &micro; is the &ldquo;death rate,&rdquo; i.e., the mean of the lifetime
distribution is 1/&micro;.
</p>
<p>&bull; Heterogeneity in lifetimes: The parameter &micro; is gamma distributed across
customers with parameters s and β, so that the mean &micro; is s/β and the
variance is s/β2.
</p>
<p>The most debatable assumptions are the Poisson purchase rates and exponen-
tial lifetimes. Both assumptions entail the memoryless property. For example
the number of purchases by an alive individual customer with known para-
meters purchasing in the next t units of time is independent of how many
purchases he or she made in any previous period of time. The implied expo-
nential distribution between purchases (given the customer is alive) means
that the customer is most likely to make another purchase directly after
the previous purchase. This might hold in certain industries but not those
where purchasing builds up customer inventory and the customer does not
purchase again until the inventory is depleted. In addition, both the time
between purchases and customer lifetimes have the property that the mean
equals the variance, which is not intuitive and appears to be restrictive. The
exponential lifetime assumption implies that the modal customer behavior
is to leave the firm fairly soon after being acquired. This might be a good
assumption in some non-contractual settings.
</p>
<p>SCM derive two important metrics: (1) the probability the customer is
alive and (2) the expected time a customer will purchase in a period of length
T&lowast;. SCM derive that for a customer who has made x purchases over T time
periods, with the last purchase being at time t, the probability the customer
is still alive can be expressed as6:
</p>
<p>6 This assumes α &gt; β. The authors derive other formulas for other cases.</p>

<p>where F is the Gaussian hypergeometric function7 (Schmittlein et al. 1987,
p. 6) with four parameters related to the four parameters that govern the
model: a1 = r + x+ s, b1 = s+ 1, c1 = r + x+ s+ 1 and z1(T ) = α&minus;bα+y . The
expected quantity purchased in a period of length T &lowast; is:

&times; P (Customer Alive)
</p>
<p>(5.14)
</p>
<p>Another important calculation is the expected remaining time that the cus-
tomer stays with the company, calculated at time t. SCM show that after
taking into account heterogeneity, the remaining lifetime for a customer (τ)
follows a Pareto distribution:
</p>
<p>f(τ |s, β) = s
β
</p>
<p>[
β
</p>
<p>(β + τ)
</p>
<p>]s+1
(5.15)
</p>
<p>where s and β are the parameters of the gamma distribution of heterogeneity
in death rate &micro;. The expected value of the Pareto distribution is
</p>
<p>E [τ |s, β] = β
(s&minus; 1) (5.16)
</p>
<p>The authors point out that since the death rate and purchase rate are as-
sumed independent, purchases made up to time T have no impact on the
remaining time we expect the customer to live. However, if the customer is
active at time T , we do need to update the β parameter to β+T . Therefore,
given the customer is still active at time T , the remaining lifetime follows a
Pareto distribution with parameters β+T and s. So the expected remaining
lifetime for a customer with purchase history {x, t, T} is:
</p>
<p>E [remaining lifetime|x, t, T, α, t, β, s] = (β + T )
(s&minus; 1) P (customer alive)
</p>
<p>(5.17)
</p>
<p>where P (customer alive) is calculated using Equation 5.13.
The above discussion centers on the &ldquo;Paredo/NBD&rdquo; model developed
</p>
<p>by Schmittlein et al. More recently, this model has been extended by
</p>
<p>7 See Fader et al. (2005) for a method to approximate the Gaussian hypergeometric
function.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.4 LTV Models that Include Unobserved Customer Attrition 125
</p>
<p>Fader et al. (2005) referred to as FHL. This extension retains the original
ideas of the Paredo/NBD model but is much easier to estimate. In fact, the
authors provide Excel spreadsheets for estimating the models.
</p>
<p>FHL&rsquo;s model is called the Beta Geometric/NBD, or BG/NBD model. It
models lifetime as a geometric distribution rather than an exponential dis-
tribution. The customer has a probability p of becoming inactive after any
transaction, so:
</p>
<p>P (become inactive after jth transaction) = p(1&minus; p)j&minus;1 (5.18)
The parameter p is analogous to the death rate &micro; in the Pareto/NBD model,
and also is modeled to be heterogeneous across customers, following a beta
distribution. Fader et al. (2004) derive formulas for P (Alive) and E(Number
of purchases) analogous to those for the Pareto/NBD model.
</p>
<p>FHL assume a consumer follows a Poisson process for purchasing. Hence
the interpurchase time is exponential. Specifically, let λ equal the purchase
rate and tj be the time the customer purchases for the jth time. Then,
</p>
<p>f(tj |tj&minus;1, λ) = λe&minus;λ(tj&minus;tj&minus;1)tj &gt; tj&minus;1 &ge; 0 (5.19)
As stated earlier, the probability an individual becomes inactive after the
jth transaction is p(1 &minus; p)j&minus;1 where p is the probability the customer be-
comes inactive immediately after the jth purchase. These two equations then
generate expressions of interest in computing LTV. The first is the expected
number of purchases in a period of length t is:
</p>
<p>E(X(t)|λ, p) = (1&minus; e
&minus;λpt)
p
</p>
<p>(5.20)
</p>
<p>and the probability the customer is alive at time τ is:
</p>
<p>P (τ &gt; t) = e&minus;λpt (5.21)
</p>
<p>The critical parameters are λ and p. The higher p is, the fewer purchases
and the less likely the customer is to be alive after t. This seems reason-
able since the probability of dying should determine the number of pur-
chases. In Equation 5.20 the limit as t goes to infinity is 1/p which is the
expected number of purchases the customer will make over the long run.
The probability the customer is alive decreases in p, which is also intuitively
reasonable.
</p>
<p>A potential problem is that as λ increases, the expected number of pur-
chases increases because the numerator of Equation 5.20 increases. However,
the expected time the customer remains alive declines as λ increases Equa-
tion 5.21. If a customer has a higher purchase rate, then he or she will
have a lower probability of being alive at time τ . This follows from the
assumption that the customer has probability p of dying after each pur-
chase. FHL&rsquo;s model implicitly assumes the more times the customer pur-
chases, the higher the probability the customer attrites. This is a questionable
assumption.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>126 5 Customer Lifetime Value: Fundamentals
</p>
<p>Once FHL develop the individual customer model, they then study how
heterogeneity in the purchase rate and probability of dying change the results.
They use Gamma heterogeneity for λ and Beta heterogeneity for p.

<p>f(λ|r, α) = α

for λ &gt; 0 (5.22)

<p>Γ(α) is the gamma function evaluated at α.

<p>f(p|a, b) = p
a&minus;1(1&minus; p)b&minus;1
</p>
<p>B(a, b)
0 &le; p &lt; 1 (5.23)
</p>
<p>where B(a, b) is the beta function which is equal to Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+ b).
The key expectations derived by FHL are:
</p>
<p>E(X(t)|r, α, a, b) = a+ b&minus; 1
a&minus; 1
</p>
<p>[
1&minus;

</p>
<p>(
t
</p>
<p>α+ t
</p>
<p>)]
(5.24)
</p>
<p>where 2F1(&bull;) is the Gaussian hypergeometric function. This is the expected
number of purchases for the whole customer base over time. Obviously, the
hypergeometric function makes it more difficult to understand the intuition
behind the results.
</p>
<p>The other expectation of interest is the expected number of transactions for
an individual with a specific observed behavior characterized by the number
of purchases made, x (frequency), the last time a purchase was made tx
(recency) and the length of the interval, T .
</p>
<p>Let E(Y (t)|X = x, tx, T, r, α, a, b) equal the expected number of transac-
tions for a time period of length t given the number of prior purchases, the
last observed purchase tx and the end of the interval T . Then,
</p>
<p>E(Y (t)|X = x, tx, T, r, α, a, b) =
a+b+x&minus; 1
</p>
<p>a&minus;1
[

(

a+ tx
</p>
<p>)r+x
(5.25)
</p>
<p>While this expression appears to be complex, FHL argue that the Gausian
hypergeometric function can be approximated using Excel. FHL test their
model versus the Pareto/NBD and find it to be equivalent.
</p>
<p>For a fixed future time interval, FHL&rsquo;s model will provide an estimate of
LTV. They compute Equation 5.25 for a customer who makes x purchases
with his or her last purchase at time tx, with the end of the base period
(period before computing future LTV) being T and the future period of
length t, what is the expected number of purchases. This times the expected
margin gives the undiscounted future LTV. To transform FHL (or SMC)
into an LTV calculation with discounting requires setting the model up with</p>

<p>5.4 LTV Models that Include Unobserved Customer Attrition 127
</p>
<p>discrete time intervals and creating conditional probabilities of staying alive
(the hazard function) for their models.
</p>
<p>To see how FHL&rsquo;s model behaves as a function of its parameters, we will
provide a relatively simple version of their model by looking at one consumer
and avoiding the complexity added by studying heterogeneity. The three key
quantities that FHL (and SCM) provide and which are extremely useful in
LTV modeling are:
</p>
<p>E[X(t)|λ, p] = the number of transactions in a period of length t,
P (τ &gt; t|λ, p) = the probability the customer will be alive after period t, and
E[Y (t)|x, tx, T, λ, p] = the expected number of transactions in the period t
</p>
<p>to T , for an individual with observed behavior X = x, tx, where tx is the
time of the last purchase in the interval [0, t].
</p>
<p>From above, λ is the purchase rate per period and p is the probability the
customer attrites after a purchase. For the example, we will use several values
of the parameters and time periods to show how the above quantities change.
We will use the following formulas to compute the quantities described
above:
</p>
<p>E[X(t)|λ,p] = 1&minus; e
&minus;λpt
</p>
<p>p
(5.26a)
</p>
<p>P (τ &gt; t|λ, p) = e&minus;λpt (5.26b)
E[Y (t)|X = x, tx, T, λ, p)
</p>
<p>=
p&minus;1(1&minus; p)xλxe&minus;λT &minus; p&minus;1(1&minus; p)xλxe&minus;λ(T+pt)
</p>
<p>L(λ, p|X = x, tx, T ) (5.26c)
</p>
<p>with
</p>
<p>L(λ, p|X = x, tx, T ) = (1&minus; p)xλxe&minus;λT + δx&gt;0 p(1&minus; p)x&minus;1λxe&minus;λtx (5.26d)
</p>
<p>The above expressions are easily computed in Excel. We will start with the
expected number of purchases in given time interval t. We will use two val-
ues of λ and two values of p to contrast the expected number of purchases.
Table 5.7a provides the values. It shows, as should be obvious, as p (the death
probability) increases, the number of purchases decreases and as λ increases;
so does the expected number of purchases. For a simple Poisson model with
λ = 0.1, which represents .1 purchase per month and a time interval of 24
months, the expected number of purchases would be λt = 2.4. For FHL,
we see that the expected number of purchases is 2.13 purchases for t = 24
(24 months). As p increases, we see that the expected number of purchases
decreases. For p = 0.25 and λ = 0.1, the expected value decreases to 1.8.
Thus, the larger the value of p, the more the model diverges from a Poisson
purchase rate model.
</p>
<p>An interesting result is shown for the probability that a customer is alive
which is displayed in Table 5.7b. It shows that as λ, the purchase rate,</p>

<p>increases, the probability of being alive decreases for fixed p. As discussed
earlier, this is a counter-intuitive result.
</p>
<p>Another result worth noting is the expected number of purchases in a
given time interval, 24 months, given past purchase behavior. This is shown
in Table 5.7c. This quantity is different than the expected number of pur-
chases because it is conditional on the time of the last purchase. The table
shows that the longer since the last purchase, the customer is expected to
make fewer purchases. Intuitively, if a customer has a high purchase rate but
does not purchase in a fixed interval, the likelihood increases that the cus-
tomer has died. Hence, for a fixed number of purchases, x, the less recent
tx, the time of the last purchase is, the smaller the number of purchases.
This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with the findings from recency
modeling.
</p>
<p>Table 5.7d shows that as λ increases, the impact of tx is much greater. The
change in the expected number of purchases has much greater differences from
low to high values of tx. Again this result makes intuitive sense.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5.4 LTV Models that Include Unobserved Customer Attrition 129
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the computations from FHL&rsquo;s model show that many of
their results are reasonable except for the assumption that each time a cus-
tomer makes a purchase, the probability of attriting is constant. This leads to
counter-intuitive results regarding the probability of attriting as a function
of the purchase rate. It may also lead to poor fits if their model is applied
at the individual level rather than at the aggregate level after allowing for
heterogeneity.
</p>
<p>The next extension, due to Fader et al. (2004) (FHB) builds on the
BG/NBD modeling the process entirely in discrete time. The key change
is moving from a Poisson to a Bernoulli purchase process. In each period, the
customer has the probability, p, of purchasing. Periods are independent and
p is constant, analogous to the stationarity and independence assumptions of
the Poisson. In fact, a Bernoulli process becomes a Poisson process as we move
from discrete to continuous time. The parameter p is heterogeneous across
customers according to a Beta distribution. The death process for the cus-
tomer follows the same geometric distribution as FHL, but the unit is the time
period, not the transaction. So each time period, the customer has a proba-
bility q of dying, and q is heterogeneous across customers according to a Beta
distribution. The authors call this model the beta-geometric/beta-binomial
(BG/BB) model. Again, they derive formulas for P (Alive) and E[Number of
Purchases] as in the other cases.
</p>
<p>In summary, the stochastic models developed by SCM, FHL, and FHB
provide models of lifetime value when customer attrition is unobserved.
These models can be used to calculate customer lifetime value estimates
both on average (analogous to a simple retention model) and for individual
customers with purchase histories (particularly the number of purchases and
time of the last purchase). However, one needs to be careful when computing
it for individuals because the amount of data per individual may be very
small. The models are rich yet remarkably simple &ndash; Table 5.6 states all that
is needed to define each model &ndash; and with the extensions of Fader et al.
relatively easy to estimate.
</p>
<p>There are two main areas for building on these models. The first is to
allow for inter-relationships between the purchase and death processes, and
especially between these processes and quantity purchased. Surely the para-
meters governing these processes should be correlated across customers. One
would assume for example that customers with high purchase rates would
have lower death rates.
</p>
<p>The second extension is to incorporate marketing variables in these mod-
els. The parameters of the model could be made functions of marketing vari-
ables. This would require for example a hierarchical Bayesian framework, for
example:
</p>
<p>p &sim; Beta(α, β) (5.27a)
α &sim; Normal(&micro;, σ2) (5.27b)
&micro; = f(marketing effort) (5.27c)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>130 5 Customer Lifetime Value: Fundamentals
</p>
<p>The real complexity would come in predicting individual-level response in
terms of purchase rates or P[Alive] as a function of marketing efforts. This
endeavor, however, would be well worth it because it would turn what now
is a ceteris paribus lifetime value model into a potential lifetime value model.
</p>
<p>5.5 Estimating Revenues
</p>
<p>The next major requirement in computing LTV is estimating revenues per
customer per period. There are many possible ways to make these estimates.
</p>
<p>5.5.1 Constant Revenue per Period Model
</p>
<p>One computes the average revenue per customer for all periods and then uses
this measure for revenue per customer per period. This is very easy to use
but very näıve and likely to be unrealistic. It is often the case that revenue
increases over time.
</p>
<p>5.5.2 Trend Models
</p>
<p>One can calculate the trend in revenue per period per customer from the ini-
tial customer acquisition period to the end of the customer&rsquo;s purchase series.
We might use segments or aggregate across customers. The trend model then
is used to capture the pattern of customer revenues over time. The trend can
be modeled using a constant growth rate or a growth curve which asymptotes
to a specific value or other shapes depending upon the revenue data pattern.
</p>
<p>5.5.3 Causal Models
</p>
<p>Revenue can be estimated using causal models in which the dependent vari-
able is the log of spending (to avoid negative predictions) and the independent
variables are causal variables such as price and other relevant variables that
should predict spending. The decision maker or researcher can use historical
values or patterns in causal variables to serve as the independent variables in
the predictions. The problem with causal models is that while they fit may
the data, they must predict future spending. To overcome this problem we
can create scenarios to understand how different values of independent vari-
ables affect spending levels. Then the firm can decide upon which scenario(s)
best fit likely firm behavior.</p>

</p>
<p>5.5.4 Stochastic Models of Purchase Rates and Volume
</p>
<p>One could use the distribution of purchase volume across consumers to predict
purchase volume for individual customers. The prediction will be a weighted
average of the customer&rsquo;s historical purchase volume and the mean for all cus-
tomers, the weights being determined by how many observations are available
for the customer. (See Columbo and Jiang (1999) and the description of the
model in Chapter 12.)</p>

<p>Issues in Computing Customer
Lifetime Value
</p>
<p>Abstract This chapter addresses the challenging details in computing LTV
that are all-too-easy to ignore. We focus particularly on the appropriate
discount rate and appropriate costs. We draw from standard corporate
finance and the CAPM model to derive the appropriate discount rate. We dis-
cuss the application of activity based costing (ABC) in computing costs.
We advocate that the only costs appropriate for LTV calculations are those
that change as a function of the number of customers within the partic-
ular application at hand (i.e., variable costs). We conclude with a discus-
sion of incorporating marketing response and customer externalities in LTV
calculations.
</p>
<p>6.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>This chapter discusses some of the major issues in computing LTV. Many
of them have received little attention in the marketing literature. Yet, each
is essential. Specifically, Sect. 6.2 addresses how to determine the appropri-
ate discount rate for calculating LTV. Section 6.3 discusses customer port-
folio management. We show that the firm reduces risk by constructing a
portfolio of customers, but this comes at the cost of lower returns. We also
discuss whether the firm should adjust the discount rate for the risk associ-
ated with individual customers or segments. Section 6.4 examines the relevant
costs to include in LTV computations. Many firms allocate fixed costs when
calculating LTV. We propose that for most database marketing decisions,
such as targeting mailings to a specific set of customers, LTV should be
calculated using just variable costs. Section 6.5 discusses incorporating re-
sponse to marketing into LTV calculations. This is especially useful if the
marketing environment is expected to change, or if the firm wants to de-
termine long-term marketing policy using LTV. The chapter ends with a
brief discussion of externalities (e.g., customer referrals) in the computation
of LTV.

<p>134 6 Issues in Computing Customer Lifetime Value
</p>
<p>6.2 Discount Rate and Time Horizon
</p>
<p>In the basic formula for LTV, LTV =
&sum;&infin;
</p>
<p>t=1
E(R̃t&minus;Ct)
(1+d)t&minus;1 where R̃t = revenue
</p>
<p>in period t, Ct = the cost in period t and d is the discount rate. We assume
revenues are a random variable but costs are known.1 A key parameter is
the discount rate. A higher discount rate means that future profit streams
(R̃t &minus; Ct) are less valuable. Many firms solve the problem of setting the dis-
count rate by limiting the length of the period over which LTV is computed.
However, depending upon retention rates and the size of the revenue stream,
revenue streams that accrue after the cutoff period may be significant.
</p>
<p>We discuss two approaches for determining d &ndash; opportunity cost of capital
(Sect. 6.2.1), and source-of-risk (Sect. 6.2.2). Our goal in providing alternative
methods is to spur further research in this area.
</p>
<p>6.2.1 Opportunity Cost of Capital Approach
</p>
<p>6.2.1.1 Basic Concepts
</p>
<p>Capital budgeting theory in corporate finance tells us that the appropriate
discount rate for evaluating the financial value of a proposed project equals
the opportunity cost of capital for the firm&rsquo;s investors. By opportunity cost,
we mean the rate of return investors can achieve on another investment of
similar risk. In calculating LTV, we think of customers as investments or
&ldquo;projects&rdquo; and hence use a discount rate equal to the rate of return investors
could make on similar-risk investments, i.e., their opportunity cost of capital.
</p>
<p>There are three key concepts: (1) the link between the appropriate discount
rate for LTV and rate of return investors could make on other investments,
(2) what investors could expect to make on investments of similar risk as the
customer projects undertaken by the firm, and (3) the definition of investors.2
</p>
<p>Rate of return and the discount rate are linked in that both represent the
time value of money. If the investor can make a 10% return on investments,
then the investor is indifferent between receiving $100,000 today and $110,000
tomorrow. So promising the investor $110,000 tomorrow is equivalent to giv-
ing the investor $100,000 today ($110,000/(1.10)). The rate of return (10%)
and discount multiplier (1/1.10) are thus two sides of the same coin. If the
investor can make 10% on alternative investments and the returns generated
by a customer are not profitable when discounted by 10% per period, the
investor would not want to invest in that customer. Hence if we want to use
LTV to decide whether to undertake a marketing activity, the activity has to
</p>
<p>1 We implicitly are assuming costs are more predictable than revenues.
2 See Hansen (2006) for a discussion of the cost-of-capital associated with LTV models.
His discussion is somewhat different than ours but his work was helpful in framing the
issues for us.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Discount Rate and Time Horizon 135
</p>
<p>be profitable using a discount rate equal to what the investor could make on
other projects.
</p>
<p>The situation is amplified by the second key concept &ndash; risk. No investment
is a sure bet, and so in calculating LTV, we need to use as a discount rate
the rate of return the investor could make on a project of similar risk to the
customer management project. For example, if the investor&rsquo;s opportunity
cost of capital at a certain risk level is d, and the LTV of a customer is
positive at that value for d, the investor still might not want to invest in that
customer if the customer is considered more risky than other projects on
which the investor can generate a return of d. A good portion of this section
will be spent on how to determine the opportunity cost of capital (hence d)
incorporating risk.
</p>
<p>The third concept is the definition of &ldquo;investor.&rdquo; For publicly owned com-
panies, the investor is the shareholder. We say the manager makes the decision
of whether to invest in the customer, but really the shareholder is making the
decision because the manager represents the shareholder. For privately held
companies, investor might be the owner who is funding the company from
personal funds but has alternative uses of those funds.
</p>
<p>6.2.1.2 Calculating the Opportunity Cost of Capital
</p>
<p>With these concepts in mind, the first step is to calculate the opportunity
cost of capital incorporating risk. A theory has been developed to do this for
publicly owned companies. Brealey et al. (2004) state, &ldquo;The cost of capital for
corporate investment is set by the rates of return on investment opportunities
in financial markets.&rdquo;3 Hence, in its general form, the cost of capital repre-
sents the alternative investment a shareholder can make in financial markets
that provides the same return and risk. It is computed as the weighted aver-
age cost of capital (WACC),4
</p>
<p>WACC =
D
</p>
<p>V
rdebt +
</p>
<p>E
</p>
<p>V
&middot; requity (6.1)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>D = amount of debt the firm has
E = amount of equity the firm has
V = D + E
rdebt = rate of return on the firm&rsquo;s debt
requity = rate of return on the firm&rsquo;s equity
</p>
<p>To compute WACC we need four key quantities: D, E, rdebt and requity. D
and E are readily available from the firm&rsquo;s balance sheet. Usually, rdebt is

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>136 6 Issues in Computing Customer Lifetime Value
</p>
<p>easy to compute because it is simply the marginal borrowing cost of the firm.
The reason for using the marginal borrowing cost is that if debt is added to
the firm, the cost of debt might increase because the risk increases.
</p>
<p>Computing requity requires using another model. The formula for requity
is:
</p>
<p>requity = rf + β(rm &minus; rf ) (6.2)
where:
</p>
<p>rf = the risk free rate
rm = the market rate of return
</p>
<p>rf is usually the T-bill rate (treasury bills) for a long-bond (10- or 30-year
treasury bond). The current rate of return for long-term treasury bonds is
between 4% and 5%.5 rm &minus; rf is the &ldquo;risk premium&rdquo; for stocks. Currently
this is in the range of 4&ndash;5%.
</p>
<p>The other unknown quantity is β (&ldquo;beta&rdquo;), which adjusts the risk pre-
mium based on how risky the firm (or investment) is. A market portfolio
(e.g., an investment comprised of all the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 or FTSE
100) will have a beta of one. Firms whose variability is greater than the
market will have a beta higher than one and those with low variability rel-
ative to the market will have a beta of less than one. Beta is very impor-
tant because the higher beta, the more the market wants to be compen-
sated for the risk it is taking and hence the higher the weighted cost of
capital.
</p>
<p>Brealey et al. (2004) provide examples of betas from the period May 1997
to April 2002.6 For example, Amazon.com had a beta of 3.3 and Pfizer had a
beta of 0.57. We will use these and assume a specific corporate debt and equity
structure and show how the weighted average cost of capital is computed.
Assume Pfizer has 20% debt and 80% equity and Amazon has 30% debt and
70% equity. Also assume that Pfizer&rsquo;s borrowing rate is 6% and Amazon&rsquo;s is
7% because it is riskier. The market premium (rm &minus; rf ) will be assumed to
be 5% and risk free rate will be 4%.
</p>
<p>The first step is to compute requity using Equation 6.2. For Pfizer it
is rPfizerequity = 0.04 + 0.57(0.05) = 0.0685 or 6.85% and for Amazon it is
rAmazonequity = 0.04 + 3.3(0.05) = 0.205 or 20.5%. Thus, required expected re-
turn for Amazon is much higher than for Pfizer because it is much riskier.
We can now compute WACC for each.
</p>
<p>For Pfizer, WACCPfizer = 0.2 &times; 0.06 + 0.8 &times; 0.0685 = 0.0688 or 6.88%
and for Amazon WACCAmazon = 0.3 &times; 0.07 + 0.7 &times; 0.205 = 0.1645 or
16.45%. Clearly, Amazon has a much higher cost of capital than does Pfizer.
</p>
<p>5 www.Bloomberg.com for March 9, 2007 indicates the 10-year treasury bond yield is
4.59%.

stocks. Simply enter a stock&rsquo;s ticker symbol and then click on &ldquo;Key Statistics&rdquo; on the
left-hand side of the page.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Discount Rate and Time Horizon 137
</p>
<p>This will manifest itself in the types of projects for which Amazon can make
investments to guarantee the rate of return its shareholders expect. Pfizer has
much lower WACC and can invest in many more potential projects because
it does not require as high a rate of return. In terms of LTV, Amazon should
use a discount rate of 16.45%, whereas Pfizer needs only use 6.88%. Amazon
will require higher returns and retention rates from its customers in order to
generate positive LTV.
</p>
<p>It is time to stop and digest the information just provided. The two critical
elements in computing WACC are: (1) beta, reflecting the riskiness of the
firm, and (2) the capital structure, namely, the amount of debt and equity.
</p>
<p>The question now is whether weighted cost of capital is the appropriate
measure for calculating LTV. The answer depends upon whether the LTV
project the firm is undertaking is within the normal scope of business and
similar to its normal investment strategy in terms of risk or it is not in the
normal course of business. If it is, investors have assumed an appropriate
cost of equity. The market has adjusted for this risk through requity and
rdebt. Then WACC is the appropriate measure. If not, then a project-specific
cost of capital should be used, which is discussed in the next section.
</p>
<p>6.2.1.3 Project Weighted Average Cost of Capital
</p>
<p>If the projects the firm is investing in are similar to those it has historically
invested in, WACC is the appropriate discount rate. However, if a proposed
project is significantly different, then there should be a project WACC be-
cause the risk is different than the market expects from the firm. Brealey et
al. (2004) observe7:
</p>
<p>The project cost of capital depends on the use to which that capital is put. Therefore, it
depends on the risk of the project and not on the risk of the company. If a firm invests in a
low-risk project, it should discount the cash flows at a correspondingly low cost of capital.
If it invests in a high-risk project, those cash flows should be discounted at a high cost of
capital.
</p>
<p>Of course, every project has a different risk. However, only those projects
with a substantially different risk level should have a project-specific cost of
capital. For example, suppose Capital One is making an investment decision
to solicit a segment of customers who are similar to those it targets for its
typical credit cards. Then the firm&rsquo;s WACC is the appropriate discount rate.
Now suppose Capital One decides to target the sub-prime market (poor credit
quality customers), which we will assume it does not do currently. Is the risk
the same as it is for its typical projects? Clearly it is much higher. Capital
One should use a higher discount rate than its WACC for this project.
</p>
<p>The major problem is determining an appropriate project-specific discount
rate. The earnings for Capital One&rsquo;s sub-prime project are likely to have a
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>138 6 Issues in Computing Customer Lifetime Value
</p>
<p>high beta because sub-prime customers are more vulnerable to downturns in
the economy. The profit flows from sub-prime customers are more volatile
than normal profit flows from investments Capital One usually makes. With
a higher beta, the firm must use a higher cost of capital and hence a higher
discount rate. To help understand how to determine the appropriate beta to
use, it is helpful to understand what beta is and how it is computed.
</p>
<p>6.2.1.4 Computing Beta and Project-Specific Discount Rates
</p>
<p>Beta is computed several ways but we will concentrate on its definition:
</p>
<p>βi =
σim
σ2m
</p>
<p>(6.3)
</p>
<p>where σim is the covariance between stock i&rsquo;s return and the market return
and σ2m is the variance of the market return. Thus, the more the stock co-
varies with the market, the higher beta. In the case of no co-variation, beta
is zero. Analysts typically obtain rates of return for a stock and the market,
calculate the covariance and variance, and compute β.
</p>
<p>Assume the firm determines there is a correlation of 0.5 between the profit
flow from its customers and the overall stock market. Further, it finds that
its variation in returns among its customers has a standard deviation of 0.1,
which is the normal variability it sees in its annual returns. An analysis of
the stock market shows that it has a 0.04 standard deviation in its returns.
Noting that σim = ρimσiσm, we calculate βi = (0.5&times;0.1&times;0.04/0.042) = 1.25.
Obviously, the difficult part of the above computation is the linking of the
returns from the market to returns from customers. Little has been published
in marketing showing how to conduct these analyses and it would be useful
to see real-world examples.
</p>
<p>For a new project it is far more difficult to determine β because there are
no data on cash flows for this project. Some firms develop general guidelines
based on the type of project. Risky projects will have a significantly higher
cost of capital than do standard projects. Some projects such as replacing a
machine where the return is based on savings might have a very low discount
rate because it is almost a guaranteed return (low σi).
</p>
<p>While the notion of project-specific discount rates for calculating LTV is
not particularly satisfying because it requires setting WACC subjectively, it
is based on sound theory. It is important to understand the basic principles
of how WACC is set and when to deviate. If the analyst is uncertain about
the risk, he or she can always revert to using the firm&rsquo;s WACC.
</p>
<p>6.2.1.5 Empirical Research on Calculating Customer-Specific
Discount Rates

rates to specific customers. The idea is that each customer is in a sense a</p>

in their application is that they calculated β relative to the returns from all
customers, instead of relative to the returns from a financial market. Denote
by &ldquo;C&rdquo; the returns from their entire customer base and &ldquo;a&rdquo; the firm&rsquo;s income
stream customer a. They calculated:
</p>
<p>βa =
CovaC
σ2C
</p>
<p>(6.4)
</p>
<p>Finance scholars would argue that one should use the market of all securities,
not the firm&rsquo;s customer base, as the &ldquo;market&rdquo; from which to calculate the
crucial covariance. The reason is that in a publicly owned company, managers
supposedly are operating in the interest of investors who can invest in the
entire securities market. Even in a privately held company, the owners of that
company are investors who should be interested in the market as a whole.
</p>
<p>Wangenheim and Lentz (2004) as well as Dhar and Glazer (2003) recom-
mend ignoring the risk-free rate and just using βa &times; Rm for the discount
rate. This implicitly assumes the risk-free rate is zero for all customers and
is a departure from finance theory. So theoretically this weakens the ties to
the CAPM. However, pragmatically, customers with higher β&rsquo;s are assigned
higher discount factors for the LTV calculation and those β&rsquo;s represent a
measure of volatility relative to the portfolio of customers as a whole.
</p>
<p>Wangenheim and Lentz (2004) calculate βa for each customer in a
European airline&rsquo;s customer base. They used revenue as the measure of re-
turns, and used the revenues generated by all the company&rsquo;s customers as the
market return. The sample included 26,776 customers over a 4-year period.
The authors calculated an alternative measure of risk, the number of periods
with no purchases (NIP) for each customer. These calculations were made
for two separate periods, period 1-quarters 1&ndash;8, and period 2-quarters 9&ndash;16.
The correlation matrix among the measures is shown in Table 6.1.
</p>
<p>The results are quite clear: βa is an unstable measure of customer risk.
It is virtually uncorrelated between two separate time periods. On the other
hand, the number of inactive periods, an ad hoc measure of risk but easier to
calculate, is very stable over time. One could question whether NIP is a mea-
sure of risk or simply a measure of purchase frequency, but in any case, the

</p>
<p>instability of β is somewhat disappointing. It might be that there were not
enough observations given that β was estimated with only eight observations,
but this did not seem to hurt the stability of NIP. One alternative would have
been to segment customers into groups based on demographics or some other
variable. They could then create a β for each segment and determine its stabil-
ity. It might have led to a higher correlation. In any case, this is an interesting
but speculative investigation of β as a measure of customer-specific risk.
</p>
<p>6.2.2 Discount Rate Based on the
Source-of-Risk Approach
</p>
<p>Many times the risk in a database marketing project may be attributable
to a specific component. For example, in deciding whether to undertake an
acquisition campaign, the acquisition rate may be very uncertain but the
long-term customer income stream matches historical risk levels. One ap-
proach for handling this is to use a high discount rate for the component of
lifetime value that is most risky (the acquisition rate), while using the firm&rsquo;s
ordinary WACC for discounting long-term income.
</p>
<p>Consider the case of evaluating a customer acquisition program that re-
quires an investment of $2,500,000 for a mailing of 1,000,000 pieces with
an expected response rate of 2%. Once a customer responds to the mailing,
he or she fits the traditional response patterns. Acquired customers gener-
ate $35 per year in net income and have a retention rate of 90%. However,
the firm believes this is a very risky project because it is not certain about
the acquisition rate. The firm therefore plans to use a 20% discount rate
versus its normal rate of 10%.
</p>
<p>Assume that the $2,500,000 acquisition investment is made at time t = 0,
and revenues begin at time t = 1. We therefore begin discounting revenues
at t = 1. In that case, the net present value of the investment is8:
</p>
<p>NPV = NαLTV &minus; I = Nαm
(
</p>
<p>1
1 + d&minus; r
</p>
<p>)
&minus; 2,500,000 (6.5a)
</p>
<p>where N = number of customer&rsquo;s mailed, m = margin per customer, α =
response rate, r = retention rate, I = investment, and d = discount rate.
For the example, N = 1,000,000, m = $35, α = 0.02, r = 0.9, I = $2,500,000,
and d = 0.2. Substituting into Equation 6.5a, the project has a net loss of
&minus;$167,667. So using conventional NPV methods the firm should not invest
in the acquisition project.
</p>
<p>However, the abnormal risk is attributable only to the first-period returns.
To account for this specific source of risk, one could find an appropriate
</p>
<p>8 Note LTV = m/(1+ d&minus; r) rather than m(1+ d)/(1+ d&minus; r), which is the usual formula
we use for a simple retention model LTV. The difference is because we assume the
discounting begins in period 1.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.2 Discount Rate and Time Horizon 141
</p>
<p>discount rate for first-period revenues, then discount the ensuing revenues at
the regular discount rate. We can arrive at an appropriate first-period dis-
count rate by asking the manager to specify a certainty equivalent; that is,
what amount of money would leave the manager indifferent between that
amount and the expected first-period earnings. Then we could solve for
the discount rate implied by the certainty equivalent, apply that discount
rate to the first-period returns, and discount subsequent period returns by
the company&rsquo;s WACC, which we assume to be 10%. The NPV of the project
can be represented as follows:
</p>
<p>NPV =
Npm
</p>
<p>1 + d1
+
</p>
<p>Npmr
</p>
<p>(1 + d2)(1 + d2 &minus; r) &minus; I (6.5b)
</p>
<p>The first term represents first-period returns, discounted by an amount d1.
The second term represents the discounted value of future returns beginning
in period 2. These will be discounted by d2, the firm&rsquo;s WACC (10%). Given
the parameters, Npm = 1,000,000&times; 0.02&times; $35 = $700,000. We then ask the
manager, &ldquo;What amount of money would leave you indifferent between that
amount for sure and the $700,000 you expect to receive in period 1, given
your uncertainty about the 2% response rate?&rdquo; Say the manager answers,
&ldquo;$550,000&rdquo;. Then the manager has told us:
</p>
<p>$550, 000 =
$700, 000
1 + d1
</p>
<p>or (6.5c)
d1 = 27.3%
</p>
<p>Now we can substitute d1 = 0.273 into Equation 6.5b, and use d2 = 0.10.
The NPV is now $606,818 and the project is profitable. Applying a 20%
discount factor to the entire calculation over-penalized the lifetime value,
making the investment appear unprofitable. When applying a high discount
rate to the part of the calculation that was really uncertain (first-period
revenues), the results changed and the project is profitable.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;source-of-risk&rdquo; approach appears to be a useful method when the
project under consideration is abnormally risky. The approach has two ben-
efits: (1) it requires the manager to think through why the project is abnor-
mally risky, and (2) it computes a more realistic net present value, highly
discounting the components of the project that are truly risky, while not pe-
nalizing the components that have normal risk. As we illustrated, the tech-
nique can change the decision. It relies on the manager stating a certainty
equivalent, which would probably not be too difficult in the example we used.
There may be other situations where it would be more difficult. Nevertheless,
source-of-risk discounting appears worthy of consideration when a project and
a customer&rsquo;s lifetime value is abnormally risky due to an attributable source.</p>

</p>
<p>6.3 Customer Portfolio Management
</p>
<p>Finance theory has developed methods for dealing with risk. The CAPM
model applies to the discount rate d and was discussed in Sect. 6.2. Modern
portfolio theory (Sharpe 2000) applies to managing customers with different
risks (variances) as well as expected returns (means). Marketers have barely
scratched the surface in applying portfolio theory, which will be discussed
in this section. Modern portfolio theory is concerned with what percentage
of a firm&rsquo;s total investment should be allocated to the various investment
opportunities available to it. The specification of these percentages creates
the investment portfolio.
</p>
<p>Consider two investments A and B. Each is characterized by an expected
return, &micro;A and &micro;B, a standard deviation around that return, σA and σB and
a correlation between these returns, ρAB. Let wi be the fraction of invest-
ment placed in investment i(i = A,B;
</p>
<p>&sum;
i wi = 1). The expected return and
</p>
<p>variance of that return for any set of w&rsquo;s are:
</p>
<p>E[return] = &micro;p = w1&micro;A + w2&micro;B (6.6)
V ariance[return] = σ2p = w
</p>
<p>2
1σ
</p>
<p>2
A + w
</p>
<p>2
2σ
</p>
<p>2
B + 2w1w2σAσBρAB (6.7)
</p>
<p>The subscript p refers to the portfolio. A given specification of w&rsquo;s constitutes
a portfolio with a specific expected return and risk (measured by the variance)
calculated using Equations 6.6&ndash;6.7.
</p>
<p>To see why a firm should invest in a portfolio rather than an individual
security, suppose there are two stocks, both of which have the annual same
rate of return, 10%. Each has a standard deviation of 2% and their returns
have a correlation of 0.5. Consider the decision of whether to purchase 100
shares of stock 1 or purchasing 50 shares of each stock. If 100 shares of stock
1 is purchased, the expected return is 10% (1 &times; 10%) and the variance is
12 &times; 22 = 4. If 50 shares of each stock are purchased, then the expected
return is still 0.5 &times; 10% + 0.5 &times; 10% = 10% but the variance is 0.52 &times; 22 +
0.52&times;22+2&times;0.5&times;0.5&times;2&times;2&times;0.5 = 3. This demonstrates a key principle &ndash;
the lower the correlation between two securities, the greater the advantage
is to creating a portfolio because for the same return, the portfolio will have
lower variance. If the correlation between two securities is 1, then there is no
diversification advantage in buying a weighted average of two securities.
</p>
<p>For customer management, the same principle can apply. If a portfolio of
two customers segments can be created, then it may have the same rate of
return but lower variance than marketing to only one customer segment.
</p>
<p>What does a portfolio of customers mean? It is the same concept as stocks
except the factor determining the commonality between customers&rsquo; rates of
return may be related to economic factors (e.g., income level), or lifestyle
differences.
</p>
<p>Suppose a firm has two potential target segments &ndash; high and low income
customers &ndash; and needs to decide whether to invest in both segments or one.</p>

</p>
<p>Assume the firm acquires 100,000 credit card customers per year from high-
income prospects. The expected annual rate of return from these customers
is 10% and the standard deviation is 2%.9 The low-income customers have a
higher expected rate of return, 20%, because they are charged a higher credit
card interest rate, but they have a standard deviation of 10% because they
are riskier. In some years, the rate of return from low-income customers is
negative because of a higher default rate.10
</p>
<p>The difference in the rates of return between the two segments are driven
by two factors: the amount they borrow (called &ldquo;revolving&rdquo;) and the degree
to which they pay off their debt (&ldquo;solvency&rdquo; risk). The firm finds that the
correlation between the returns of the two groups is 0.75.
</p>
<p>The firm constructs three alternative portfolios. One contains 10% low-
income and 90% high-income, the second has 30% low-income and 70% high-
income and the third has 50% of each. The expected return and variance of
each portfolio is computed using Equations 6.6 and 6.7. Table 6.2 shows the
results.
</p>
<p>The expected return for portfolio 1 is 11% with a standard deviation of
2.06%. For portfolio 2 it is 13% with a standard deviation of 3.31% and for
portfolio 3 it is 15% with a standard deviation of 5.10%. The firm feels that
portfolio 1 is far superior to its current strategy of targeting only high income
customers (10% return with a standard deviation of 2%) because, for very lit-
tle increase in risk (0.05%), it can increase its return to 11% versus 10%. How-
ever, portfolios 2 and 3 increase the risk beyond what it views as tolerable.
</p>
<p>The concept of customer portfolios clearly has some benefits. The critical
inputs the firm must determine are the relative rates of returns, the variability
</p>
<p>9 Note we are setting up this example in terms of expected annual returns, to follow
finance theory as close as possible. However, we could also set up the problem in terms
of LTV per customer segment, in which case we would want to use segment-specific
discount rates.
</p>
<p>10 For example, homeowners from the lower income households are facing penalties and
tougher credit causing default problems in the &ldquo;subprime&rdquo; market (see, Simon 2007).</p>

<p>in returns and the correlation in returns. If these can be estimate adequately
by the firm, it can construct a portfolio of different segments of customers.
</p>
<p>Figure 6.1 illustrates how these calculations could be used to find the &ldquo;op-
timal&rdquo; portfolio, the set of w&rsquo;s that is best for the investor. There are three
important steps:
</p>
<p>1. Calculate and graph all the possible portfolios by considering all possible
w&rsquo;s. (Note: Fig. 6.1 was constructed assuming three potential investments
with characteristics shown in the notes to the figure.)
</p>
<p>2. Identify the &ldquo;efficient frontier&rdquo; set of portfolios. This consists of the set of
portfolios such that one cannot improve both the expected return and the
risk by varying the w&rsquo;s. Figure 6.1 shows the efficient frontier as an upper
envelope. Any portfolio within the envelope is not efficient because one
can either increase return for the same risk or decrease risk and obtain the
same return.
</p>
<p>3. Place the investor&rsquo;s &ldquo;indifference curves&rdquo; on the graph and find the high-
est indifference curve that has a tangency to the efficient frontier. The
portfolio at that tangency is the optimal portfolio. The indifference curves
in Fig. 6.1 are based on a utility function of the form U = b &times; Expected</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.4 Cost Accounting Issues 145
</p>
<p>Return &minus; c &times; Variance. This means that an indifference curve would be of
the form Expected Return = U/b+ (c/b)&times; Variance. The investor would
be indifferent among any set of portfolios whose expected returns and vari-
ances satisfy this equation, since they all yield the same utility U . As one
increases U , one gets higher indifference curves. So the point of tangency
in Fig. 6.1 shows the portfolio that yields the highest utility.11
</p>
<p>The above procedure can be used to decide how many customers of each
risk/return profile to acquire in order achieve the firm&rsquo;s goal, which might
be to create a portfolio of customers that generate high return at acceptable
risk. The trade-offs between risk and return would be captured by the utility
function. The w&rsquo;s would be the fractions of each type of customer to acquire.
</p>
<p>In summary, the concept of customer segment portfolios is very impor-
tant. Many firms use some variant of the concept but do it intuitively rather
than systematically. In finance, a major breakthrough was creating stock
portfolios to be on the efficient frontier. The opportunity exists for database
marketers to apply the same concepts. Little work in database marketing has
focused on customer portfolio management. However, it is a promising area of
research.
</p>
<p>6.4 Cost Accounting Issues
</p>
<p>Whether in the context of LTV or any cost-related calculations of cus-
tomer value, quantifying costs can be a severe challenge. Seppanen and Lyly-
Yrjanainen (2002) make the useful distinction between product and customer
costs. Product costs pertain to the cost of producing the product sold to the
customer. Customer costs refer to the marketing and service costs incurred by
the customer. Customer costs are particularly relevant for LTV calculations
so we focus on them.
</p>
<p>6.4.1 Activity-Based Costing (ABC)
</p>
<p>Costs may vary significantly among customers, depending on variation in
customer-specific marketing efforts, customer orders, and customer after-
service calls. The challenge is to quantify these costs on a per customer basis.
Searcy (2004) suggests activity-based costing (ABC) as a method for doing
so. ABC attempts to link customer activities such as placing orders to the
costs of executing those activities (Kaplan and Cooper 1998). Searcy suggests
five steps to implement an ABC analysis:
</p>
<p>11 Sharpe(2000, part 1, chapter 4) shows how to formulate the identification of the efficient
frontier and the selection of the optimal portfolio as a mathematical program.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>146 6 Issues in Computing Customer Lifetime Value
</p>
<p>1. List the &ldquo;activities&rdquo; which a customer might undertake (e.g., fulfilling an
order).
</p>
<p>2. Determine how much the organization spends on each activity in total.
3. Identify the organization&rsquo;s products, services, and customers.
4. Select &ldquo;drivers&rdquo; for each activity. A driver is the customer action that
</p>
<p>causes the activity to take place (e.g., placing an order).
5. Calculate the activity rates, i.e., the cost to fulfill one order.
</p>
<p>Table 6.3 shows an example of an activity-based costing scheme for a hy-
pothetical catalog company. The company identified five customer-related
activities: catalog mailing, filling web orders, filling telephone orders, data
maintenance, and after-sales support. It then listed the costs directly incurred
in executing these activities &ndash; salaries, printing, shipping, and hardware/soft-
ware. Then it listed the drivers of these costs, e.g., catalog mailing costs are
incurred when catalogs are mailed, and the company mailed 1,000,000 cata-
logs in the year of consideration. The number of web orders drives the filling
web orders activity. Next the company allocated these costs to each activ-
ity, using the cost drivers when possible. For example, the company spent
$2,825,000 on salaries in the year under consideration. $1,875,000 was allo-
cated to filling telephone orders. This is determined from telephone operators
costing $22.50/h including benefits, time per order is 10 min per order and
there are 500,000 orders totaling to $1,875,000. Other allocations such as
printing and shipping costs can also be made accurately, whereas others were
less scientific, e.g., salaries related to filling web orders.
</p>
<p>Note that costs that could not be allocated directly to activities, but were
considered part of customer-related costs, were classified as overhead. For
example, there was $1,000,000 in hardware/software overhead, and $100,000
in salaries that were related to customers but not classifiable in any of the
activities. The overhead was allocated to each activity proportionally to the
subtotals of the direct costs for that activity. Allocating overhead is contro-
versial and is discussed later.
</p>
<p>An important and final step is then the calculation of cost per activity. The
most expensive activity is after-sales support, because it absorbs typically as
much as 30min in service personnel time. Note the much lower cost of filling
a web order compared to filling a telephone order. This comes about because
of the salaries that must be paid to fill telephone orders, whereas the web
requires almost no salaries.
</p>
<p>Table 6.4 shows an application of the ABC-based costing scheme to evalu-
ate the profitability of three customers. Customer A places only four orders,
but they are all on the web and therefore do not cost much. This customer also
only placed one after-sales call. The customer generated a profit of $58.91.
Customer B places twice as many orders, but is actually less profitable. This
is because the orders are placed on the telephone, and the customer demands
significantly more after-sales support. Customer C is perhaps what manage-
ment would like to do with Customer B. Customer C also places eight orders,</p>

<p>but places them on the Web, and only makes two after-service calls. This cus-
tomer&rsquo;s profit is more than double that of Customer B ($101.84 vs. $42.88).
</p>
<p>Table 6.4 illustrates the value of the ABC approach. The analysis also
raises important marketing issues. For example, it is clear that Customer
B would be more profitable if the customer could be migrated to the Web
and encouraged to use the Web for after-sales support. This makes sense
from a cost perspective. However, the lack of human contact could weaken
the customer&rsquo;s loyalty to the firm in the long run (Ansari et al. 2008). In
any case, the analysis is valuable because it identifies potential cost savings,
highlights differences among customers, and raises the broader issues of what
happens to the customer when we cut costs.
</p>
<p>6.4.2 Variable Costs and Allocating Fixed Overhead
</p>
<p>An important issue in activity-based costing as well as in all cost calculations
for LTV analysis is the allocation of fixed overhead. There are two schools
of thought &ndash; full costing versus marginal costing. Full costing says that all
fixed costs must be allocated. Table 6.4 shows that this &ldquo;overhead&rdquo; can be
significant and its allocation a bit arbitrary. For example, why was so much
hardware/software overhead allocated to telephone fulfillment? The arith-
metic reason is that the allocations were proportional to the costs of that</p>

<p>activity. However, that may inflate the cost of filling orders via telephone,
making telephone customers look more expensive and less profitable, and
causing the company to migrate customers to the Web, which might not be
good for loyalty.
</p>
<p>Overhead allocations can saddle customers with huge costs that actually
yield negative lifetime values. Consider a telecom firm that has just made a
huge investment in infrastructure. If these costs are allocated per customer,
it is easy for many customers to have negative LTV&rsquo;s, even though these
customers contribute to profits and &ldquo;firing&rdquo; them would decrease profits.
</p>
<p>The alternative is marginal (variable) costing where the only costs
allocated to the customer are those that vary with the number of customers
and are directly attributed to servicing or marketing to the customer. The
view of the &ldquo;marginal costers&rdquo; is that the goal is to ascertain how much each
customer contributes to fixed overhead and therefore to profit. To saddle
the customer with arbitrarily allocated overhead costs hides the true value
of the customer, and may convince the firm to &ldquo;fire&rdquo; a customer, leaving the
firm with less profit, or not acquiring a customer and losing an opportunity
to increase profit.
</p>
<p>To understand why fixed overhead should not be included in LTV, suppose
a firm has 100,000 customers who on average spend $150 per year with a
gross margin of 40%. The firm has a fixed overhead cost of $3,000,000 which
includes the office complex, top management&rsquo;s compensation and other fixed
costs. Variable costs per customer (e.g., catalog mailings) are $10. Table 6.5
provides the income statement for the base case. The profitability of the
customer is $50 without allocating overhead and $20 with overhead.
</p>
<p>Suppose the firm is considering adding 10,000 new customers. Since we as-
sume overhead is fixed, it does not increase when the 10,000 new customers
are added. We can now construct an income statement with the new cus-
tomers added. This is shown in Table 6.6. We see that profit increases by
$500,000. This is $50 per customer, so the value of these new customers is
$50 per customer, not $20.</p>

</p>
<p>Increase in net profits (cf. Table 6.5) $500,000

</p>
<p>One might argue that the firm must allocate overhead because these costs
must be &ldquo;covered&rdquo;. True, for the firm to stay in business it must cover its
overhead costs. But this is not relevant for making business decisions such
as whether to add new customers. The firm can improve profits by adding
customers that contribute at the margin. If the firm adds fixed overhead to
the computation of the value of a customer, it will under-invest in adding
new customers and will not maximize profits.
</p>
<p>Many associate &ldquo;overhead&rdquo; with &ldquo;fixed,&rdquo; but it is quite possible that over-
head does vary with an increase in the number of customers. It is then a
variable cost. Suppose that one could model these costs using an equation
to capture how they change as the number of customers change. Assume the
equation is OH(N) = 2,500,000 + 5&times;N where N is the number of customers
and OH(N) is the overhead associated with N customers. To continue our ex-
ample, N = 100,000 and OH(100,000) = $2,500,000 + $5 &times; N = $3,000,000.
When the firm adds 10,000 customers, overhead increases by $50,000. Specif-
ically, the marginal overhead cost for adding a new customer is $5 which is
the coefficient in front of N . This cost should be subtracted from the prof-
itability of a new customer and for our example the incremental profit would
be lowered to $45.
</p>
<p>How does the firm determine the coefficients for the equation above? One
method is to run a regression in which the number of customers is the in-
dependent variable and the overhead expenses of the firm is the dependent
variable. It is important to adjust these numbers for inflation because other-
wise there is spurious correlation between the number of customers (usually
increasing) and costs (also usually increasing).
</p>
<p>Another important concept is that of &ldquo;semi-variable&rdquo; costs. Semi-variable
costs vary with the number of customers according to a step-function. The
complication this adds to the computation of LTV is that it makes costs a
non-linear function of the number of customers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.4 Cost Accounting Issues 151
</p>
<p>To understand semi-variable costs, we begin with a firm that has 1,000,000
customers with average sales per year of $50, variable costs of $35 and a
margin of $15. The firm incurs fixed costs of $2,000,000 per year including
the costs of its call center. The average customer has a yearly retention rate of
85%. The acquisition cost per new customer is $50. The firm uses a discount
rate of 15%. The LTV, given these assumptions and a simple retention lifetime
value model, is $57.50.12
</p>
<p>Assume that starting from its current situation, the next additional
200,000 customers require the firm to build another building, incurring a
one-time cost of $500,000. The next 200,000 customers add $300,000 more,
and each additional 200,000 customers after that adds $150,000. This traces
out a step function. We call these semi-variable costs. More generally, cus-
tomer center costs are nonlinear in the number of customers. The question
is: &ldquo;How does this affect the cost side of the LTV calculation?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The answer depends upon the decision being made. Assume the decision
is whether the firm should add 200,000 customers. Also assume for the first,
simplest example, that the $500,000 is a one-time cost. The computation for
the decision is then very straightforward. We have the acquisition cost of $50
per customer. The LTV calculated earlier is $57.50. The decision is to add
200,000 new customers comes with a one-time incremental cost of $500,000.
The incremental profit from adding the customers is 200,000 &times; ($57.50 &minus;
$50) &minus; $500,000 = $1,000,000. In this example the semi-variable cost is a
one-time cost and so it is subtracted from the net profit at the time the
decision is being made to add new customers. Table 6.7 shows the company&rsquo;s
current year profit statement and the net gain in LTV. Note that current
year profits decrease because of the investment in customer acquisition, but
add $1,000,000 in the long term.
</p>
<p>For our second example, suppose the same assumptions as above are used
except instead of adding a building, the firm realizes if it adds 200,000 cus-
tomers, the additional $500,000 will be per year due to adding supervisors
and layers of management. It will have an incremental cost (above its current
variable costs) of $2.50 per new customer ($500,000/200,000). How does the
firm compute the LTV?
</p>
<p>Thinking of lifetime value as the incremental benefits and costs associated
with a customer, the solution is also straightforward. We add $2.50 to the
variable costs for the new 200,000 customers. The total variable costs per
new customer are now $35.00+$2.50 = $37.50, and profit contribution is now
$12.50 per customer. LTV is now $47.92 rather than $57.50. The net impact
of the acquisition is now 200,000 &times; ($47.92 &minus; $50) = &minus;$416,667 (Table 6.8).
It is now unprofitable to add the new 200,000 customers.
</p>
<p>The tricky part of this problem is that we are now assuming variable
costs per the new customers are $37.50, different than $35.00 for existing
customers. This is despite the fact that the new customers will use the call
</p>
<p>12 The formula for computing LTV for this example is LTV = m
1&minus;k where k = r/(1+d),m
</p>
<p>is the margin, r is the retention rate, and d is the discount rate.</p>

<p>center no more or no less than current customers. However, this goes back to
(1) linking the treatment of semi-variable costs to the decision at hand, and
(2) thinking of LTV as incremental costs and benefits generated by customers.
The decision is whether to add 200,000 more customers, and these customers
force us to spend an additional $500,000 per year on the call center.
</p>
<p>If we were to amortize the $500,000 among the 1,200,000 customers we
would have after the acquisition of the 200,000 customers, it would amount
to only $0.42 per customer. This would result in a profit contribution of
$14.58 per customer, an LTV for the new customers of $55.89, and we would
calculate the profits to be 200,000 &times; ($55.89 &minus; $50) = $1,178,000, although
Table 6.8 clearly shows the net result is lower profits.
</p>
<p>For this example, the key point is that costs are non-linear, in this case
a step function. The costs could also be concave or convex in the number of
customers. The shape of the cost function is critical. Most articles about LTV
assume a constant variable cost function, i.e., variable costs per customer are
constant in the number of customers.
</p>
<p>Our final example will cover a different decision. Suppose the firm wants
to compute LTV after it has added the 200,000 new customers. However, we
will change the parameters of the decision slightly to make the incremental
customer profitable. We will use all of the same assumptions used earlier in
this section except we will assume the 200,000 new customers add $0.50 (not
$2.50) per customer due to supervisors and management personnel required</p>

<p>to manage the additional customers. The profit contribution per customer is
now $14.50 and the LTV for this segment of customers is $55.58 and Table 6.9
shows the acquisition is profitable.
</p>
<p>Now suppose the 200,000 customers have been acquired and the firm wants
to calculate LTV for planning purposes, e.g., to target certain customers for
a loyalty program. If we know how much of each resource a customer uses,
then customer-specific variable costs could be calculated using ABC costing.
If the usage level is not known, we would simply use the average variable
cost per customer. Total variable costs are now $35&times; 1,200,000+ $100,000 =
$42,100,000, or $42,000,000/1,200,000 = $35.083 per customer. Thus, the
profit contribution per customer across their entire customer base is now
$50&minus; $35.083 = $14.927 and the average LTV per customer is now $57.18.
</p>
<p>In summary, determining the costs to use in an LTV calculation can be
the most difficult part of the calculation. The single most challenging issue
is whether to include fixed or only variable (marginal) costs. Researchers can
be found who advocate full costing (e.g., Searcy 2004; Foster et al. 1996,
p. 11) as well as marginal costing (Mulhern 1999, p. 29; also see Gurau and</p>

<p>Ranchhod 2002). Our recommendation is to link the determination of costs
to the decision being made and recall that LTV is the net present value of
incremental profits and costs. If the decision is to add customers, their LTV
should be calculated using the costs they add to the company. Marketers
are likely to skip over these elements of the calculation, but as the above
discussion illustrates, they can be crucial in actual applications.

<p>6.5 Incorporating Marketing Response
</p>
<p>The LTV models reviewed so far do not take into account how customers
respond to marketing efforts. These models view lifetime value as a ceteris</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.5 Incorporating Marketing Response 155
</p>
<p>paribus calculation: given the environment stays the same, what is the value
of the customer? These calculations can be useful but including marketing
response in the calculation of LTV can be very valuable (Berger et al. 2002;
Calciu and Salerno 2002) for at least two reasons:
</p>
<p>&bull; Marketing efforts may in fact change so calculations that assume a constant
marketing effort are erroneous;
</p>
<p>&bull; Incorporating market response allows firms to examine the impact of policy
on customer value.
</p>
<p>Note, however, that LTV is essentially a prediction of future customer value,
discounted to the present. As a result, if incorporating marketing efforts re-
quires the firm to predict future marketing efforts and these are difficult to
predict, incorporating future marketing efforts might in fact diminish the
accuracy of LTV.
</p>
<p>Rust et al. (1995) were among the first to relate marketing expenditures
to customer value. They model the following process:
</p>
<p>Marketing =&gt; Objective =&gt; Perceived =&gt; Customer =&gt; Market =&gt;
Profit
</p>
<p>Expense Quality Quality Retention Share
</p>
<p>The authors do not measure LTV at the customer level, but rather ag-
gregate up to market share and profit. Their market share and profit models
are:
</p>
<p>MSt =
rMSt&minus;1Nt&minus;1 + (1&minus; r&prime; &minus; c)(1&minus;MSt&minus;1)Nt&minus;1 +A(cNt&minus;1 +Nt &minus;Nt&minus;1)
</p>
<p>Nt
(6.8a)
</p>
<p>Profitt = Y &times;MSt &times;Nt &minus;Xt (6.8b)
where:
</p>
<p>r = retention rate
MSt = market share in period t
Nt = number of customers in market, i.e., market size, in period t
r&prime; = retention rate for competitors
c = rate at which customers leave the market
A = % of new customers who choose the brand, i.e., acquisition rate
Y = profit margin
Xt = Expenditure on quality improvement in period t
</p>
<p>To complete the model, the authors assume that the retention rate r is a
function of perceived quality, which in turn is a function of objective quality,
which is a function of marketing expense, so essentially:
</p>
<p>r = f(Xt) (6.9)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>156 6 Issues in Computing Customer Lifetime Value
</p>
<p>In addition to the explicit link between marketing expense and retention
rate in Equation 6.9, the authors include in Equation 6.8a the number of cus-
tomers who switch to the firm, and the acquisition of new customers among
the pool who either has left the market in the previous period (cNt&minus;1) or
joined the market this period (Nt&ndash;Nt&minus;1). Note that the authors focus on
marketing&rsquo;s impact on retention rate, not on acquisition rate or the percent-
age of customers who leave the market. These would be obvious extensions
to the model.
</p>
<p>The challenge of course is to estimate Equation 6.8a. The authors suggest
using market testing and discuss an application we review in Chapter 7. The
authors also calculate the net present value of the profit stream as follows:
</p>
<p>NPV =
P&sum;
</p>
<p>k=1
</p>
<p>Y &middot;MSt+k(1 +G)kNt &minus;Xt+k
(1 + δ)k&minus;1
</p>
<p>(6.10)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>G = annual growth rate in the total number of customers in the market
δ = annual discount factor
NPV is the aggregate analog of LTV
</p>
<p>Blattberg et al. (2001) and Blattberg and Thomas (2000) develop a &ldquo;customer
equity&rdquo; model in which they model acquisition rate, retention rate, and future
&ldquo;add-on selling,&rdquo; as functions of marketing actions. Their customer equity
model is at the customer segment level and is as follows:
</p>
<p>CEt =
I&sum;
</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>⎡⎢⎢⎣Nitαit(Sit &minus; cit)&minus;NitBiat
</p>

</p>
<p>(1 + δ)k
</p>
<p>⎤⎥⎥⎦
(6.11)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Nit = Market &ldquo;potential&rdquo; in period t, i.e., the number of customers in segment
i available to be acquired.
</p>
<p>αit = Acquisition rate for segment i in period t
Sit = Sales per customer in segment i in period t
cit = Cost of goods sold for segment i in period t
Biat = Acquisition expenditures per customer in segment i in period t
ρit = Retention rate for segment i in period t
Bir,t = Retention expenditures per customer in segment i in period t</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.5 Incorporating Marketing Response 157
</p>
<p>Bi,AO,t = Add-on sales expenditures per customer in segment i in period t
δ = Discount factor
</p>
<p>Equation 6.11 traces the lifetime value of a firm&rsquo;s customer franchise starting
from acquisition and proceeding over the customers&rsquo; lifetimes. The analysis is
at the segment level, which is practical in real-world applications. The model
identifies three drivers of customer equity: acquisition, retention, and add-
on sales. Add-on sales include cross-selling and up-selling sales. Blattberg et
al. discuss strategies for increasing these quantities. Blattberg and Thomas
suggest models that would link marketing expenditures to these three quan-
tities, i.e.:
</p>
<p>αit = ka
</p>
<p>⎡⎣1&minus; e&minus; J&sum;j=1λjBiatj
⎤⎦ (6.12a)
</p>
<p>ρit = kr

1&minus; e&minus;γBirt] (6.12b)
</p>
<p>Sit =
Jit&sum;
j=1
</p>
<p>Oijtrijt (6.12c)
</p>
<p>Bi,AO,t =
Jit&sum;
j=1
</p>
<p>OijtCijt (6.12d)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Biatj = Expenditures for acquisition activity j targeted at segment i in
period t
</p>
<p>Oijt = Number of offers of type j made to segment i in period t
Cijt = Unit cost of type j offers made to segment i in period t
rijt = Response rate and contribution from type j offers made to segment i
</p>
<p>in period t
</p>
<p>Equations 6.12a&ndash;d are crucial for driving customer value over time and would
have to be estimated through market testing.
</p>
<p>Comparing the Rust et al. (1995) (RZK) and Blattberg et al. (2001)
(BGT) models, both consider customer acquisition as well as retention. RZK
is at the aggregate customer level whereas BGT is at the segment level, al-
though RZK could easily formulate their model at the segment level (see
Rust et al. 2000) in addition to Rust et al. (1995). RZK focus on reten-
tion rates and model the process from expenditure to objective quality to
perceived quality/satisfaction to retention, whereas BGT model just the re-
lationship between expenditures and behavior. BGT include acquisition and
add-on selling impact as well as the impact on retention.
</p>
<p>Both models could be used evaluate current versus alternative marketing
efforts. The key relationships are between marketing effort and retention,
and in BGT&rsquo;s case, acquisition and add-on selling as well. These relation-
ships could be estimated using historical data, managerial judgment (see also</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>158 6 Issues in Computing Customer Lifetime Value
</p>
<p>Blattberg and Deighton 1996), or market tests. For example, a firm could
test an offer by extending it to each of its market segments and measuring
the response rate rijt. Similar tests could be used to gauge the effective-
ness of acquisition as well as retention efforts. With BGT&rsquo;s model, the firm
would only have to measure customer behavior (i.e., how many customers
were acquired, how many were retained, etc.) whereas the RZK model would
require surveys to measure perceived quality/satisfaction. This would take
more effort but provide rich diagnostics. Both models also require knowledge
of the size of the market; i.e., how many potential customers are available
in each time period. RZK model this explicitly through customers leaving
the market (c) and customers defecting from competitors to the focal com-
pany (r&prime;). RZK also explicitly model the growth of the market through the
parameter G.
</p>
<p>The next step is for these models to be estimated empirically and the links
between marketing and LTV quantified. Another step would be to optimize
marketing efforts over time. See Chapters 26, 28 and 29 for discussion along
these lines.
</p>
<p>6.6 Incorporating Externalities
</p>
<p>Another measure of customer value is the externality generated by the cus-
tomer. Externalities include word-of-mouth, which could be positive or neg-
ative, or the number of referrals generated by the customer.
</p>
<p>A challenging circularity occurs in trying to incorporate customer refer-
rals in lifetime value calculations. One could imagine including the expected
revenue generated through referrals but that revenue is the lifetime value of
the referred customer. In order to calculate that lifetime value, however, one
must take into account that the new customers might refer customers, and
these new customers have lifetime values. So one faces an infinite recursion
and it is not clear how to incorporate it into lifetime value.
</p>
<p>Another complication would be, if one wanted to value the entire customer
database one customer at a time, one would have to be careful not to double-
count. For example, customer i might have referred customer j, so customer
i&rsquo;s LTV would include customer j&rsquo;s. So should customer j be treated as not
having a separate LTV? In short, incorporating referral value of a customer
in LTV calculations is a challenging area that needs to be addressed.
</p>
<p>Hogan et al. (2003) conduct an analysis of word-of-mouth externalities
in which they merge a lifetime value model and a Bass diffusion model to
calculate the impact of a customer &ldquo;disadopting&rdquo; the category. An example
of disadoption, analyzed by Hogan et al., is the decision not to continue with
online banking after an initial trial. Note we do not mean that the customer is
moving to another company&rsquo;s online banking service but that the customer
has decided no longer to use online banking. This can produce a harmful</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6.6 Incorporating Externalities 159
</p>
<p>effect to the entire industry due to a smaller customer base in the industry.
For example, the Bass model can be stated as:
</p>
<p>n(t) =
(
p+ q &times; N(t)
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>)
&times; (m&minus;N(t)) (6.13)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>n(t) = number of new adopters in period t
N(t) = total adopters as of period t
m = marketing potential parameter
p = innovation parameter
q = imitation parameter
</p>
<p>When customers leave the market, N(t) andm both decrease. Since N(t) &gt; m,
the impact of losing one customer is to decrease the ratio N(t)m and hence a
smaller number gets multiplied by the imitation parameter. This slows the
growth of the market and hence generates fewer sales for all firms.
</p>
<p>In an empirical application to the online banking industry, Hogan et al.
find that this indirect effect (on imitation) due to disadoption can be larger
than the direct loss in revenues (in the case of online banking, cost savings),
to the extent that the disadoption occurs earlier. Hogan et al. make two
additional points. First is that a disadoption by a competitor also carries
the indirect effect, so competitive disadoptions can hurt the firm. Second is
that a disadoptor may in fact spread negative word of mouth and have a
further negative impact on the firm. This is not explicitly incorporated in
the Bass model (m &gt; 0) but Hogan et al. use a simple assumption (one
disadoptor causes another would-be adoptor to delay purchase by 5 years
due to negative word-of-mouth) and show that the financial impact can be
substantial.
</p>
<p>In summary, customers can be valued by externalities in terms of word-
of-mouth and in terms of the number of referrals. The referral issue needs
empirical work to demonstrate its magnitude, and also conceptual work on
how to incorporate it into lifetime value calculations. Word-of-mouth has been
initially investigated by Hogan et al. (2003) but needs further work especially
in estimating negative word-of-mouth from disadoption of the category.</p>

</p>
<p>Customer Lifetime Value Applications
</p>
<p>Abstract The prior two chapters have covered the technical aspects of Life-
time Value Modeling. But how is LTV applied in the real-world and what
types of questions can LTV provide answers that traditional marketing analy-
ses can not? This chapter will provide some answers to these questions. We
will discuss how LTV models can be used in the real-world and describe some
applications from the literature.
</p>
<p>We begin this chapter with the basic analysis of customer acquisition, which
has been one of the primary applications of LTV analysis. We will then
study reactivation strategies in which the firm selects customers to target
for reactivation based on their LTV. Next we will provide some examples of
how LTV is used to segment the customer base and is then linked to specific
market actions. We will end with the use of LTV models to value firm&rsquo;s
customer bases and ultimately the value of the firm.
</p>
<p>7.1 Using LTV to Target Customer Acquisition
</p>
<p>Probably the earliest application of LTV modeling is for customer acquisi-
tion. It offers a very different approach than is commonly used in marketing
analysis because it looks at the long-term value of a customer to determine
if the firm should make the investment required to acquire the customer. By
using an LTV metric for customer acquisition, the firm can determine which
acquisition strategies provide the highest payouts or are above the hurdle
rate.
</p>
<p>Most marketing analysis would concentrate on marketing spending and
its return (now called return on marketing investment &ndash; ROMI). The typical
ROMI model does not separate acquisition from retention marketing spend-
ing and cannot see if investing in new customers pays out.
</p>
<p>161</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>162 7 Customer Lifetime Value Applications
</p>
<p>The method begins by determining how much is being spent on customer
acquisition. This may be difficult to determine in some industries because
it is not be possible to separate new from existing customer expenditures.
For example, consumer packaged goods firms often do not know to whom
their spending is targeted beyond certain demographic groups. To allocate
their spending between acquisition versus retention spending is almost im-
possible. These firms have very little understanding of customer acquisition
costs.
</p>
<p>It is easiest to understand the steps if we use an example. Suppose a B2B
firm wants to compute the cost of acquiring a customer. In our example, we
will assume the firm makes 3 calls per prospect before it decides to cut off fu-
ture sales calls if no progress is being made. Out of every three prospects, one
on average becomes a lead &ndash; a prospect that provides some type of &ldquo;buying
signal&rdquo;. Each lead receives approximately 4 sales calls and 1 out of 2 leads
become a customer. Thus, it takes on average 17 sales calls to generate one
sale.
</p>
<p>To cost a sales call the firm keeps records on the direct expenses of a
sales person. The average sales person can make 4 calls per week and earns
approximately $95,000 per year. Further, there are travel and direct support
costs for the sales person which average $35,000 per year. Hence the direct
costs associated with the sales person is $130,000 per year. A sales person
makes approximately 200 sales calls per year (50 &times; 4). Thus the cost of a
sales call is $650. If it takes 17 sales calls to close one customer, then the
acquisition cost is 17&times; $650 = $11,050.
</p>
<p>The next step is to determine the lifetime value of the customer once
acquired. For this example, the average new customer generates $8,000 in-
cremental profit per year and the retention rate for the customer is 0.75. The
firm&rsquo;s discount rate is 15%. Using the LTV formula for this set of assump-
tions (Chapter 5, Equation 5.2), we have LTV = m(1 + d)/(1 + d&minus; r), where
m = the incremental margin, r = the retention rate and d = the discount
rate. This results in the LTV per customer of $23,000. This is greater than
the acquisition costs of $11,050.
</p>
<p>Suppose the firm could develop a segmentation strategy for its perspective
customers. The firm has a segment of customers it estimates will have an in-
cremental margin of $3,000 and the same retention rate as above. This yields
LTV = $8,625. The firm cannot afford these customers given the acquisition
cost of $11,050.
</p>
<p>If the firm can identify customers who have low potential sales, what meth-
ods can the firm use to acquire them that generates an LTV greater than the
acquisition costs? The firm decided to use telemarketing to generate leads
in which low potential firms (identified by firm size) were contacted by out-
bound telemarketing representatives. The average telemarketing representa-
tive makes 10 calls to generate a qualified lead and the estimated cost per
call was $3. Through these calls the firm qualified a set of firms. It then sent
a sales representative who on average made two direct sales calls and had</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.2 Using LTV to Guide Customer Reactivation Strategies 163
</p>
<p>approximately a 50% chance of closing the account. The acquisition costs
for these customers are $30 (for telemarketing) +$650&times; 4 = $2,630 cost per
customer acquired.
</p>
<p>Assume the customers acquired through telemarketing contribute incre-
mental profit of $3,000, a 0.75 retention rate and we use a discount rate
of 15%. The LTV of these customers is therefore $3, 000 &times; (1 + 0.15)/(1 +
0.15&minus;0.75) = $8,625, which is greater than the acquisition costs and makes it
profitable to use telemarketing techniques to acquire lower-valued customers.
</p>
<p>The lessons we have learned from using our LTV model for customer ac-
quisition are: (1) LTV is a better metric for customer acquisition than initial
year one profit because the firm is likely to lose money during the acquisition
year which would result in not acquiring as many customers (or any cus-
tomers) as is optimal; (2) comparing LTV to acquisition costs may allow the
firm to design alternative acquisition strategies and tactics which can result
in finding ways to acquire lower LTV customers.
</p>
<p>7.2 Using LTV to Guide Customer
Reactivation Strategies
</p>
<p>In Chapter 6 we discussed some issues associated with customer reactivation
which is a very important application of LTV modeling. We will discuss the
generic reactivation problem and briefly mention several relevant articles.
</p>
<p>According to Stauss and Friege (1999), regaining lost customers is im-
portant for several reasons. First, it helps to secure future sales and
profits. Second, the acquisition costs associated with replacing lost cus-
tomers can be reduced. Lastly, the negative effect of word-of-mouth can be
controlled.
</p>
<p>There are two metrics commonly used to assess the payback from reactiva-
tion: (1) the ex-customer&rsquo;s first-year profitability, and (2) the ex-customer&rsquo;s
LTV. Stauss and Friege (1999) use Second Lifetime Value (SLTV) &ndash; the life-
time value of a recaptured customer &ndash; instead of LTV of the terminated
relationship for calculating the value of a regained customer.
</p>
<p>Griffin and Lowenstein (2001) build on the framework laid out by Stauss
and Friege (1999). They propose a general outline for reacquiring lost cus-
tomers. According to them, firms should segment lapsed customers on the
basis of SLTV, and identify the reason why the customers defected.
</p>
<p>Griffin and Lowenstein, using data from publishing firms, show that the
SLTV decreases with the duration of a customer&rsquo;s lapse. In addition the way
in which the customer was acquired also affects the SLTV. For example,
the value of the customer is higher if the customer was recruited through a
subscription card for that particular publication as opposed to a secondary
subscription source that handles multiple subscriptions.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>164 7 Customer Lifetime Value Applications
</p>
<p>In a related study, Thomas et al. (2004a) looked at how firms should price
customers when reacquiring them and how they should price them when
they have been reacquired. The most interesting result shows that pricing
affects reactivation tenure. An interesting and somewhat surprising result is
that the higher the reactivation price, the longer the tenure of the reacti-
vated customer. This finding can be explained by heterogeneity in price sen-
sitivity with the more price sensitive customers being more likely to change
their buying behavior due to price. They also hypothesized, contrary to Grif-
fin and Lowenstein&rsquo;s result described above, that the longer lapse durations
are positively related to second durations. Thomas et al. found, however,
that the relationship was directionally negative although not statistically
significant.
</p>
<p>The area of customer reactivation strategies and SLTV is an under re-
searched area. Because of addressability and knowledge of historical behav-
ior, firms should be able to identify segments of lapsed customers who have
high profit potential (SLTV). In order to determine lapsed customers profit
potential, an understanding and analysis of the reliability of SLTV is needed.
To date, no one has conducted such analyses.
</p>
<p>7.3 Using SMC&rsquo;s Model to Value Customers
</p>
<p>In Chapter 5 we discussed a model developed by Schmittlein et al. (1987)
which we call the SMC model. The model provided estimates of how many
active customers the firm has, the likelihood that each customer is &ldquo;alive&rdquo;
and what expected number of purchases the customer will make over a
given future time interval. For businesses in which there is no contrac-
tual relationship, using models provided by SMC or Fader et al. (2005)
is essential for determining the customer&rsquo;s lifetime value. We will discuss
a paper by Schmittlein and Peterson (1994) in which they applied the
SMC model to an industrial firm to answer some of the questions dis-
cussed above. They also provided some empirical validation of the SMC
model. We will not repeat the equations provide in Chapter 5 but will
discuss the application and how SMC&rsquo;s model was used in an industrial
setting.
</p>
<p>Schmittlein and Peterson&rsquo;s (SP) application relates to an office products
firm. The primary data SP obtained were order data, initial date on the file
and amount spent per order. Because customers had no contractual obliga-
tion, determining when a customer was active was one of the primary mod-
eling requirements.
</p>
<p>SP show how SMC can be applied at the individual level. The key quanti-
ties needed are: (1) the probability the customer is alive within any time inter-
val, (2) the number of orders to be made and (3) the average order quantity for
the customer. In Table 4 of SP (1994, p. 57), which we summarize in Table 7.1,</p>

<p>Fig. 7.1 Likelihood the customer is still alive and expected number of future purchases,
as a function of number of recent purchases.
Assumptions:
</p>
<p>R = 0.415
α = 0.415
s = 2
β = 4
</p>
<p>SP show the computations for a future 5-year period for ten customers. For
each customer, they compute the probability the customer is active, the ex-
pected number of orders, the average order quantity and the expected dollar
volume. Because of the nature of their model, they did not net present value
the purchases. What is interesting in Table 7.1 is that customers have either
a very high or very low probability of being alive. Only one customer has
a probability of 0.38 while the other customer either have a probability of
being alive of 0.9 or greater or 0.2 or less. This is an interesting result but
may be caused by the choice of the ten customers for whom they displayed
the data.
</p>
<p>Another interesting insight to be gleaned from the model is the trade-off
between the customer remaining active and the expected number of pur-
chases in an upcoming period. Figure 7.1 graphs P(Alive) and E(number of
purchases in next 2 periods) as a function of x, the number of purchases
between time 0 and T = 2, with the last transaction at t = 1. Figure 7.1
shows that as the number of purchases increases, the expected number of
purchases, given the customer is alive, increases. This is because if a cus-
tomer has purchased a large number of times in [0,2], he or she probably
has a high purchase rate, λ, even if the last purchase occurred in period 1.
However, if the customer made a large number of purchases in [0,1] and did</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.3 Using SMC&rsquo;s Model to Value Customers 167
</p>
<p>not purchase in period 2, there is a decent chance that customer has at-
trited. As a result P(active) follows an inverted U shape as the number of
purchases increase. If the number of purchases is small and there have been
no purchases in a while (x = 0), there is a good chance that customer is no
longer alive. If the number of purchases is large but there have not been any
purchases in a while, there is also a good chance the customer is no longer
alive.
</p>
<p>This has important ramifications for customer profitability analysis. The
Schmittlein, Columbo, and Morrison method allows one to calculate the
probability the customer is still alive, the expected remaining lifetime, and
the expected number of purchases in a given time horizon, for each customer.
The ideal customer will be one who is likely to be alive, has a long expected
remaining lifetime, and has a high purchase rate. Figure 7.1 illustrates that
there may be trade-offs among at least two of these quantities.
</p>
<p>The other interesting aspect of their application is that they are one of the
few authors who modeled the purchase dollar amount per order. Most appli-
cations merely assume the dollar amount per order is either the average for
the population or for the individual. They used a weighted average estimate
for the purchase dollar amount per order based on the information obtained
from individual customers and the overall population average amount per
order. This is a form of a shrinkage estimator and allows them to develop an
individual dollar amount per order.
</p>
<p>SP conduct a number of validation tests of the model. They show for
example that the model predicts very accurately the number of customers
who will make 0, 1, 2, etc., purchases over some future length of time. An
important phenomenon the model attempts to capture, however, is the no-
tion of the customer being &ldquo;alive.&rdquo; To validate this, the authors classified
each customer in their database into categories [0&ndash;10%], [10&ndash;20%], etc. Then
they contacted 40 customers in each of these &ldquo;deciles,&rdquo; and asked them
whether they could report &ldquo;active status.&rdquo; Figure 7.2 shows a clear monoton-
ically increasing relationship between the predicted classification and the
percentage who self-reported being alive. There may be some regression to-
ward the mean, e.g., only 55% of those in the [90&ndash;100%] group reported
being active, while 22% in the [0&ndash;10%] group reported being active. How-
ever, this could be a function of the way the &ldquo;active&rdquo; question was asked.
In any case, the strong monotonically increasing relationship is clear and
impressive.
</p>
<p>SP&rsquo;s study is an excellent application of SCM&rsquo;s model. It shows how the
model can be used to estimate individual LTV&rsquo;s and it also provides some
model validation results. The other interesting element of their model is that
it is applied in a business-to-business setting. Many of the applications of
LTV models are better suited for industrial or business-to-business settings
because the available databases are much better than for consumer product
firms selling through channels of distribution.</p>

</p>
<p>7.4 A Case Example of Applying LTV Modeling
</p>
<p>Van Raaij et al. (2003) report the first experience of a business-to-business
company with incorporating customer value analysis into their marketing
planning. The company, which we will call &ldquo;DBM,&rdquo; was a multinational firm
in the market for professional cleaning products. It sold directly to end-users
such as in-flight caterers and professional cleaning services, as well as through
distributors. It divided its market into sectors such as healthcare, lodging, or
dairy. Sales and profits had been leveling off after years of growth and DBM
was worried about new competitors. Further non-product costs (e.g., costs to
service customers) had been increasing. The company desired to assign these
costs to individual customers and calculate customer profit.
</p>
<p>DBM undertook a six-stage process to calculate profit at the customer
level and then develop strategies based on the results:
</p>
<p>1. Select active customers
2. Design the customer profitability calculation model
3. Calculate customer profit
4. Interpret the results
5. Develop strategies
6. Establish an infrastructure for future applications.
</p>
<p>Selecting active customers: The selection of active customers as a first step
is quite interesting in view of the models we have reviewed for calculating
whether in fact a customer is alive. DBM&rsquo;s approach was quite pragmatic: a
customer was active if it had made at least one purchase in the period under
consideration. Another issue facing DBM was whether to define the customer
as end-users or distributors, or both. DBM decided on end-users because it
wanted to develop its marketing efforts from the point of view of the end-user.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.4 A Case Example of Applying LTV Modeling 169
</p>
<p>This made life difficult because sometimes DBM had to gather information
on end-users through distributors, but DBM made the effort and excluded
the revenues generated by distributors with whom it could gain agreement
for them to supply information to DBM.
</p>
<p>Designing the profitability model : The design of the profitability model
centered on the assignment of costs. For this DBM used activity-based costing
(ABC) (Chapter 6). DBM devised the following list of cost activities (the cost
&ldquo;pool&rdquo;) and cost drivers:
</p>
<p>Cost activity Cost driver
</p>
<p>Logistics Costs charged by logistics partner
Order processing Number of orders placed by customer
Technical service Service hours spent by mechanics at
</p>
<p>customer
Customer consultants Consultant hours spent at customer
Equipment Cost of equipment placed at customer
</p>
<p>Much of the expense involved with each activity was labor costs, which
prior to utilizing Activity Based Costing had simply been designated as over-
head. Now with the ABC model, DBM could assign labor costs to the par-
ticular activities demanded by each customer, and hence calculate customer-
specific costs. There were still overhead costs such as product development
and non-activity specific sales and marketing costs, and these were allocated
to each customer proportional to the customers&rsquo; gross sales. These should not
have been added to the value of the customer since they will distort future
marketing costs (Chapter 6). Firm-level overhead such as office housing, etc.,
were not included in the cost calculations.
</p>
<p>Calculating profitability : The calculation of profitability required data on
revenues as well as costs, and these were assembled from various data sources
within the company.
</p>
<p>Interpreting the results: The most obvious initial finding was the great
disparity in profitability across customers. While we often talk about the
80/20 rule, where 20% of customers accounts for 80% of revenues or profits,
in this case, DBM found that 20% of customers accounted for 95% of profits.
The customer &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; is shown in Table 7.2.
</p>
<p>Perhaps most interestingly, the top customers provided smaller per cus-
tomer margins than the large customers. DBM reasoned that this was because

ordered by profitability.
</p>
<p>top customers had superior bargaining power and hence negotiated lower
prices. They also required higher levels of support.
</p>
<p>The company used the customer profit curve to plot what they called
a &ldquo;Stobachoff&rdquo; curve (Storbacka 1997). This is simply the equivalent of a
cumulative lift curve. It orders the customers according to profitability, and
then plots the cumulative profit accounted for by these customers as one
progresses from the highest to lowest profit. Figure 7.3 shows that in this
example, 75% of the customers are profitable (the curve increases up to about
that point) while 25% are unprofitable. Given that the top 75% of customers
accounts for 120% of the profits, the remaining 25% really drag profits down.
In this case there are a lot of profitable customers but they are subsidizing a
relatively small number (at least a minority) of unprofitable customers. Note
that by adding fixed costs through overhead, the firm may be distorting the
true profitability of the remaining 25% of the customers. Some of these may
be incrementally profitable.
</p>
<p>DBM examined these Stobachoff curves for each of its 13 sectors. They
classified each sector into one of four groups based on the number of profitable
customers being relied on and how much they were subsidizing the unprof-
itable customers. The result is Fig. 7.4, which depicts four distinct cells. In
the low dependence, low subsidizing cell, all customers are profitable and
roughly equally so. In the low dependence, high subsidization cell, most cus-
tomers are profitable but there are a few unprofitable customers who drag
down total profits. In the high dependence, low subsidizing cell, there are only
a few profitable customers and the rest of customers are unprofitable but not
highly so. In perhaps the most dangerous case is the high dependence, high
subsidization cell. In this case, there are a few highly profitable customers,
and many highly unprofitable customers. This is dangerous because if those</p>

</p>
<p>Develop Strategies: DBM analyzed its Stobachoff curves for each of its
13 sectors. Nine of them showed little subsidization. However, two sectors
were in the low dependence, high subsidization cells, suggesting that the
few customers dragging down profits should be dealt with individually. The
remaining two sectors were in the high dependence, high subsidization cells,
meaning the profitable customers had to be nurtured while the others either
had to be &ldquo;fired&rdquo; or at least made marginally profitable.
</p>
<p>In addition to the Stobachoff curve analysis, sector managers were pro-
vided with detailed profitability calculations for each customer. This allowed
managers to focus on individual customers who were either extremely prof-
itable or unprofitable. Often the unprofitable customers were consuming an
inordinate amount of a particular cost activity, e.g., technical services. The
manager could work with the customer to reduce these costs.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>172 7 Customer Lifetime Value Applications
</p>
<p>In summary, the customer profitability analysis (CPA) provided both
sector-level and specific customer strategies that vastly improved the way
DBM managed its customer base.
</p>
<p>Establish infrastructure: DBM decided to perform the CPA every 6
months. The first major hurdle for this company was making sure it could
assemble the cost information on a customer basis. Doing so enabled them to
calculate individual customer profitability and went a long way in developing
its customer strategy. DBM managers realized however that in the long-term,
they needed to integrate marketing efforts and incorporate lifetime value and
customer potential explicitly in the system.
</p>
<p>7.5 Segmentation Methods Using Variants of LTV
</p>
<p>7.5.1 Customer Pyramids
</p>
<p>Probably the most common analysis of customer profitability data is to rank
customers in terms of profit and classify them in a customer &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo;
(Zeithaml et al. 2001). The pyramid shape occurs because usually a minority
of customers account for the majority of profits. Figure 7.5 shows a hypothet-
ical example of a customer pyramid. We saw a similar example in the DBM
</p>
<p>PLATINUM
5% of Customers 
40% of Profits

<p>7.5 Segmentation Methods Using Variants of LTV 173
</p>
<p>analysis above. Customer pyramids form the basis of customer tier programs,
which are discussed in Chapter 23.
</p>
<p>Figure 7.5 shows that the top 20% of customers account for 80% of profits,
although this group can be sub-divided into Platinum and Gold segments,
where the Platinum segment is only 5% of customers but accounts for 40%
of profits, while the Gold segment is 15% of customers and accounts for 40% of
profits. Clearly those in the Platinum segment are key customers. The Iron
segment holds its own &ndash; it consists of 30% of customers and accounts for 30%
of customers. The Lead segment, consisting of half the firm&rsquo;s customers, is
unprofitable.
</p>
<p>The customer pyramid is simply another way of displaying the Stobachoff
curve used in the DBM example. However, the customer pyramid commonly
displays the data in four segments and Zeithaml et al. discuss various ways to
develop each of these segments. They discuss applications to the marketing
research, real estate, and medical industries. Several aspects of creating and
managing the customer pyramid are important.
</p>
<p>&bull; Single-measure based : The single measure can be profit, LTV, sales lev-
els, or potentially even a combination of these. The advantage of a single
measure is simplicity; the disadvantage of course is over-simplification.
However, in actual applications, firms can look at several measures within
each pyramid segment. For example, current period profit might be used
to define the pyramid, but the firm could consider LTV as well as cus-
tomer response to marketing when examining the customers within each
pyramid.
</p>
<p>&bull; Firing vs. ignoring vs. developing the customer : A key decision in customer
pyramid management is deciding when to develop a customer, when to
leave a customer alone, and when to fire a customer. This corresponds
to increasing marketing efforts, leaving marketing efforts as they are, and
decreasing marketing efforts. The key questions are for example, &ldquo;Can an
&lsquo;iron-tier&rsquo; customer be converted into gold, or should we avoid investing
in this customer, make average profits, and invest in other customers?&rdquo;
These are difficult questions and depend of course on marketing response
of the customer as well as competitive and firm resource issues.
</p>
<p>&bull; The pyramid is only as good as the extent to which it differentiates cus-
tomers: Zeithaml et al. (2001) emphasize that while by definition the
customer pyramid differentiates customers in terms of profitability, they
should be differentiated in other key respects as well. For example, cus-
tomers in different tiers should differ in their preferences for service levels
and their willingness to pay for these levels. In addition, customers in each
segment should be accessible, i.e., &ldquo;addressable&rdquo; in CRM terminology. The
customer&rsquo;s potential LTV should be high in order to invest in converting
at least some of these customers into higher tiers. Finally the firm should
have the resources to be able to invest in potentially high-valued customers.
Under these circumstances, customer pyramids are a valuable byproduct
of customer value assessment.</p>

<p>7.5.2 Creating Customer Portfolios Using
LTV Measures
</p>
<p>Ang and Taylor (2005) provide an interesting application of LTV measures
to create a portfolio matrix of customers. They begin with two key measures
that affect LTV, tenure and gross margin. Using these metrics they divide
customers into four quadrants based on these metrics: low and high tenure
and low and high margin. They then name these quadrants. Figure 7.6 below
shows the matrix with the names used by Ang and Taylor.
</p>
<p>The interesting element of their paper is that they then compute the size
and customer profitability for each cell of the matrix. Figure 7.7 shows the
results. Ang and Taylor show that 10% out of 14% (5/7) of the customers
with low tenure and low profits are unprofitable and 20% out of 42% of the
customer with high tenure but low profitability are unprofitable. The firm
then has to decide what actions to take.
</p>
<p>Ang and Taylor recommend certain actions for each cell. For low-tenure,
high-margin customers encourage contracts by offering lower-priced service
for entering a 12-month contract. For high-tenure, high-margin customers
maintain high level of service and provide avenues for advocacy. For high-
tenure, low-margin customers advertise benefits of high priced plans that
come from additional features. Finally, for low-tenured, low-margin customers
increase prices and reduce service.</p>

<p>Applying the strategies above, Ang and Taylor described how 18% of
the low-tenured, low margin customers were ultimately shifted to high mar-
gin customers. Thus, a combination of classifying customers and then ap-
plying different strategies, led to higher profits and longer tenure for some
customers.

<p>7.6 Drivers of the Components of LTV
</p>
<p>In a two papers, Thomas et al. (2004b) and Reinart et al. (2005) discuss
the drivers of two components of LTV &ndash; lifetime duration and cumulative
profits &ndash; and the drivers of customer acquisition. Their study used a series of
three linked models for duration, profits, and acquisition. Then by applying
their model, they showed that many firms are either under or over investing
in acquisition or retention marketing.
</p>
<p>From the results provide in their papers, we have identified some of the
key factors that determine acquisition rates. These are: (1) acquisition ex-
penditure level, (2) demographics and (3) size of market. For duration,
the key variables are: (1) retention expenditures, (2) customer usage rates,
(3) cross-buying (how many categories purchased), and (4) share of wallet.
For profitability, the key variables are: (1) acquisition and retention dollars
(2) customer usage rates, (3) lifetime duration, (4) cross-buying, and (5) share
of wallet.</p>

</p>
<p>None of the results for acquisition rates is surprising but their method
can be applied to any company&rsquo;s database to make a determination of what
factors determine higher or lower acquisition rates. For lifetime duration and
profitability, there are some interesting findings. Breadth of purchase and
share of wallet are both intuitively appealing but not well-known in the real
or academic world.
</p>
<p>Thomas et al. (2004b) use their estimated equations for relationship du-
ration, profit contribution, and acquisition likelihood to compute optimal
marketing expenditures. They found that firms&rsquo; spending is very far from
&ldquo;optimal&rdquo;. In Table 7.3 above, we show their key results. It shows that the
lowest improvement is 28.9% in increased profitability. The conclusion we
draw from their findings is that using models of key LTV components is
likely to help firms improve their spending levels. No generalization can be
made regarding whether firms over or under spend. However, if Thomas,
Reinartz and Kumar&rsquo;s results are replicated across other firms, it appears
there is a significant opportunity to increase profits through models of the
type proposed in Thomas et al.
</p>
<p>7.7 Forcasting Potential LTV
</p>
<p>Employing traditional econometric models, Kim et al. (1999) provide a
method of forecasting customer-level potential lifetime value for business cus-
tomers in a telecommunication company. We formally define the potential
lifetime value of customer i as:
</p>
<p>PLVi =
&infin;&sum;
t=1
</p>
<p>(Rit &minus; Cit)/(1 + γ)t&minus;1 (7.1)
</p>
<p>where PLVi is the potential lifetime value of customer i, Rit is the revenue
generated from customer i at time t, Cit is the cost or expenses incurred for
customer i at time t, and γ is the discount rate. Depending on the firm&rsquo;s
data collection interval, the time interval t above can be monthly, quarterly,
or yearly. Similarly, the discount rate γ depends on the data interval t.
</p>
<p>The firm&rsquo;s objective is to maximize the potential lifetime values of its
customers. The firm should find the optimal Cit to maximize PLVi for each
time interval t. Hence, we need to solve a complex optimization problem since</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.7 Forcasting Potential LTV 177
</p>
<p>the revenue Rit is clearly a function of past and current costs/marketing ex-
penditures (Cit). We need to specify the functional form of the revenue re-
sponse curve with respect to the current and previous costs and estimate its
parameters with appropriate data. Moreover, the costs consisted of several
components such as cost of goods sold, service, and various marketing costs.
Different allocation of total cost into these components may change PLVi.
Hence, we make an simplifying assumption that the firm incurs costs propor-
tional to the corresponding revenue, Cit = βRit. We also assume that β is
constant over customer and/or time. With this proportionality assumption,
Equation 7.1 becomes
</p>
<p>PLVi =
&infin;&sum;
t=1
</p>
<p>(1&minus; β)
(1 + γ)t&minus;1
</p>
<p>Rit (7.2)
</p>
<p>The problem of finding the potential lifetime value of customer i becomes
the problem of forecasting his/her future revenue streams. The proportional-
ity assumption allows us to easily calculate the PLVi from forecasted future
revenues. The appropriate specification of forecasting models (for future rev-
enue streams) depends on several factors including data availability, indus-
try characteristics, forecasting horizon, costs, ease of application, and so on
Makridakis et al. (1983). So their forecasting model is somewhat customized
for forecasting revenues of business customers in a telecommunications com-
pany. Compared to residential customers, business customers are better tar-
get markets for one-to-one marketing because their average revenues are large
and their revenue distribution across business customers is highly skewed. In
their study, the top 3% of its business customers account for 60% of total
business revenues.
</p>
<p>The revenue from customer i at time t(Rit) are decomposed into two parts
and each component is estimated separately. That is, Rit = Qit &middot;CSit where
Qit is the telecommunication demand of customer i at time t and CSit is
the firm&rsquo;s market/customer share. The econometric model for total telecom-
munication demand includes several independent variables such as the size
of business, past telecommunication expenditures and growth rates. On the
other hand, market share prediction is mainly based on a customer survey.
Upon predicting future revenue streams for each customer, potential lifetime
values are derived using the Equation 7.2. They also calculated the realized
lifetime values for the corresponding customers that practitioners often use
as its proxy. Figure 7.8 shows the relationship between the realized and the
potential lifetime values. The correlation is about 0.4 and is statistically sig-
nificant at p = 0.05. However, there are a number of customers whose po-
tential lifetime values are fairly large but their realized lifetime values are
small. They may be customers with high growth potentials. There are also
some customers who have large realized lifetime values with relatively small
potential lifetime values.</p>

<p>7.8 Valuing a Firm&rsquo;s Customer Base
</p>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, one of the important applica-
tions of customer valuation is to value the firm&rsquo;s customer base. This value
should relate to the firm&rsquo;s stock market value, and hence be of significant in-
terest to senior management. In addition, it helps other firms who might be
interested in acquiring the company determine what would be a reasonable
price.
</p>
<p>Gupta et al. (2004a) applied a simple retention model of lifetime value
to assess the value of five firms&rsquo; customer bases. The analysis is conducted
at the customer cohort level, where cohort 0 is the current customer base,
cohort 1 is the customers to be acquired next year, cohort 2 is the customers
to be acquired the year after, etc. The lifetime value of cohort 0 is:
</p>
<p>LTV0 = n0
&infin;&sum;
t=0
</p>
<p>mt
rt
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)t
&minus; n0c0 (7.3)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>LTV0 = Lifetime value of the current customer base.
n0 = The current number of customers.
mt = The margin contributed by the average customer in the tth period of
</p>
<p>their lifetime.
r = Retention rate.
c0 = Acquisition cost per customer among current customers.
</p>
<p>Equation 7.3 is the standard simple retention model with acquisition costs
subtracted to produce the net profit contribution of the cohort.
</p>
<p>The authors recognize that an important contributor to the long-term
value of the company (which supposedly is what the stock market and any</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7.8 Valuing a Firm&rsquo;s Customer Base 179
</p>
<p>acquirer should take into account) is the future set of customers to be acquired
by the company.
</p>
<p>In general, we have:
</p>
<p>LTVk =
nk
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)k
</p>
<p>&infin;&sum;
t=k
</p>
<p>mt&minus;k
rt&minus;k
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)t&minus;k
&minus; nkck
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)k
(7.4)
</p>
<p>where LTVk is the net present value (in t = 0) of the lifetime value of the
customer&rsquo;s to be acquired k periods from now. Summing Equation 7.4 over
all cohorts (k = 0, 1, . . . ,&infin;) yields the total value of the customer database:
</p>
<p>CustomerValue =
&infin;&sum;
k=0
</p>
<p>{
nk
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)k
</p>
<p>&infin;&sum;
t=k
</p>
<p>mt&minus;k
rt&minus;k
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)t&minus;k
&minus; nkck
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)k
</p>
<p>}
(7.5)
</p>
<p>The authors devote considerable time to estimating the key components
of their model. To estimate nk, the number of customers to be acquired k
periods from the present, they obtain quarterly data on the size of each firm&rsquo;s
customer base and estimate a diffusion-like growth model to project nk into
the future. This of course assumes the pattern of acquiring customers can
be projected into the future, but the model is estimated on quarterly data
over 5 years, fits well, and incorporates the notion of a peak and subsequent
decline, so is realistic. To estimate contribution margin m, the authors use
company annual reports and divide by the number of customers. We should
note that they are using an average cost, not an incremental cost which
will be important in businesses that have high fixed costs such as retailers
or distribution businesses. They are able to calculate this number for the
cohorts in their historical data, and find them to be fairly stable from cohort
to cohort. In addition, they assume that the profit contribution for a given
cohort does not change over time, given of course that the customer is still a
customer.
</p>
<p>The authors estimate acquisition costs by dividing the number of acquired
customers by marketing costs. This is a fairly strong assumption, but four of
the five firms they investigated were relatively new at the time of their study,
so the assumption amounts to the majority of marketing expenditures going
toward customer acquisition at least in the early periods. This assumption
will break down in the future, but by that time the discount factor would
make this not too bad an assumption. The authors estimate retention rate
by consulting industry experts and other published data. The retention rates
ranged from 70% for Amazon to 95% for Ameritrade. Finally, the authors
used a discount rate of 12%.
</p>
<p>The key results are shown in Fig. 7.9. The figure shows that customer
valuation calculated via Equation 7.5 matches the stock&rsquo;s market value (share
price times number of shares) very well for Ameritrade, Capital One, and
E&lowast; Trade. Interestingly, the customer valuation strongly under-estimates the
market value of Amazon.com and eBay.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>180 7 Customer Lifetime Value Applications
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.9 Customer base valuation versus stock market value (From Gupta et al. 2004a).
</p>
<p>The authors offer potential explanations, e.g., they cite reports that claim
the market might be over-valuing eBay. Also, they discuss that the unique
nature of eBay as a representative of buyers and sellers, makes it difficult to
calculate the number of &ldquo;customers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The authors also raise the possibility that the model is not capturing all
the phenomena the market is using the value the customer and hence the
firm. For example, the simple retention model does not capture the value
of word-of-mouth, which might be significant for Amazon and eBay. The
market might also be thinking of extending the Amazon and eBay brand
names into other industries. For example, Amazon started as a purveyor of
books, and now sells DVD&rsquo;s, electronic equipment, etc. eBay started as a US
company, but is now seeking to extend its reach to China. These issues would
be factored into the lifetime value calculation by including add-on selling, or
allowing margin contributions to increase over time, whereas Gupta et al.
assumed they were constant.
</p>
<p>There are technical issues in lifetime value calculation that might influence
the accuracy of the simple lifetime value formula. First, if the customer base is
highly heterogeneous in retention rates, using an average retention rates can
underestimate lifetime value. Second, the authors are using a simple retention
model on a quarterly basis and a migration model might be more appropriate,
where customers could leave and then come back (Chapter 5). This might be
accommodated indirectly by the model since the model calculates the number
of additional customers each period, not distinguishing whether they are truly
new to the firm or customers who are migrating back.
</p>
<p>In any case, this is very promising and interesting work. It clearly demon-
strates the potential to relate the value of a firm&rsquo;s long-term customer base
with the market&rsquo;s assessment of the value of the firm. The three cases where
the model predicts well show the potential of the approach; the two cases
where the model does not predict well opens the door for future research.</p>

<p>Database Marketing Tools: The Basics</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Chapter 8
</p>
<p>Sources of Data
</p>
<p>Abstract &ldquo;Data&rdquo; is the first word in database marketing with good rea-
son &ndash; the quality, impact, and ultimately, ROI of database marketing pro-
grams depend on the availability of good data. We discuss the various types
of customer data available, e.g., customer demographics, transactions, and
marketing actions, and the sources that provide these data such as internal
records, commercially processed numbers and segmentation schemes, exter-
nally available customer lists, and primary survey data.
</p>
<p>8.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The customer information file (CIF) is the building block for database mar-
keting. A customer-focused company always makes its decisions based on the
analysis of customer data, and a detailed customer record is the prerequisite
for useful analysis.
</p>
<p>Customer information may include everything about customers, ranging
from their names, addresses, phone numbers, their demographic and lifestyle
information, transaction histories, and everything that can be derived from
customer contacts. It is true that more detailed information leads to better
decision-making. However, there is a trade-off between costs and benefits of
collecting data. Therefore, it is a good idea to prioritize each data element
once you list out the necessary data elements to be included in your customer
information file.
</p>
<p>The task of constructing the customer information file ideally begins with
the objectives its users set. Hence, its size and specific data elements depend
on the decision-making problems managers attempt to solve with the cus-
tomer information file. Unfortunately, some companies have made mistakes,
building their customer databases simply because their competitors have built
one or because of some vague vision that it would be good to have all &ldquo;the
data&rdquo; available. As a result, some companies have spent millions of dollars
assembling data and have not seen a clear pay-off. The poor performance of
</p>
<p>183</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>184 8 Sources of Data
</p>
<p>these investments has given &ldquo;CRM&rdquo; a bad name in many companies. In these
companies, CRM has become associated with huge information technology
investment in assembling data, but no clear plan on how to use it productively.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, we recommend the following process for constructing a cus-
tomer database:
</p>
<p>For example, in Step 1, a company&rsquo;s managers may stipulate their desire
to focus on campaigns that reduce customer churn, and campaigns that in-
crease cross-selling. In Step 2, they list customer product ownership, customer
attrition, and previous campaign histories as the types of data they need to
support these activities. In Step 3, they list the exact data they want and
how they will obtain it. For example, they list the specific products for which
customer ownership is needed and how they will obtain these data.
</p>
<p>The rest of this chapter focuses on Steps 2 and 3, the types of customer
data that are available, and the sources of these data. A fourth step not
covered here but discussed to some extent in Chapters 10 and 25, is the
financial evaluation of the data themselves. Many companies may find it is
too expensive to compile a specific data field, even though the above process
has determined it would be valuable. Sometimes, the company can purchase
data from an outside source on a &ldquo;trial basis,&rdquo; see how well it works in the
predictive models that support its marketing activities, and if so, purchase
the data for the long term.
</p>
<p>8.2 Types of Data for Describing Customers
</p>
<p>There are no standard ways of classifying the types of data elements in-
cluded in customer information file. Moreover, the types of data elements are
different across industries and companies. For our convenience, we classify
them into (1) customer identification data, (2) demographic data, (3) psy-
chographic or lifestyle data, (4) transaction data, (5) marketing action data,
and (6) other types of data.1 We focus on the common data elements that
most companies have in their customer information file.
</p>
<p>8.2.1 Customer Identification Data
</p>
<p>Customer identification data is the most basic customer information, cover-
ing various classification data, the customer&rsquo;s contact addresses, and other
useful customer-identification data. More specifically, they include customer&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>1 We did not include competitive data in our typology because most companies do not
have them. However, in Section 8.3.3 we discuss the use of surveys to acquire competitive
information for a small sample of customers and infer from that the competitive behavior
of the rest of the customers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.2 Types of Data for Describing Customers 185
</p>
<p>name (first, middle, last, prefix and suffix), a unique id, home and business
addresses, home, business and mobile telephone numbers, email addresses,
date of birth, and so on. For business customer data, they may also include
names of contacts, departments, fax numbers, etc.
</p>
<p>Customer identification information is rarely used in building (statisti-
cal) response models partially because it is nominally scaled.2 However, they
are critical in maintaining the customer relationship because they provide
the means to contact the customer. Catalogers can&rsquo;t send their catalogs to
customers without customers&rsquo; correct addresses. Telemarketers can&rsquo;t initiate
selling activities without customer&rsquo;s phone numbers.
</p>
<p>There are two customer identification fields worthwhile to mention in
greater detail. The first is the customer ID that is uniquely assigned to each
customer upon her first contact with the company. Later this customer id is
used as a key field to link to other databases. Once the ID is assigned for a
customer, the same ID will be used for her repeat visits/contacts. That is, in
order to keep track of all customer interactions, we should have a system to
identify who a customer is and then pull her customer ID or assign a new cus-
tomer ID. It is relatively easy to keep track of purchases made by using store
(credit) cards that have the ID number on the card. Similarly, online sellers
will easily identify customers if they log in with their User IDs. But some cus-
tomers may pay cash or by a new credit card. Many retailers have difficulty
identifying customers without store cards. These retailers attempt to match
repeat customers by name, address, phone number or their combination.
</p>
<p>Second, identification fields such as address and phone number need to be
regularly updated. More than 40 million Americans change their addresses
annually. In a year, 17% of consumers move and 22% of businesses move. It
is important to keep customers&rsquo; addresses accurate and up-to-date. A fast
and cheap way of updating address is to employ a NCOA (National Change
of Address) supplier licensed by the United States Postal Service. To use
this service, all customer names with their addresses are sent to the NCOA
service provider. Then the data is typically standardized to confirm to the
USPS requirements including ZIP+4 code. Next is to match the data against
the NCOA file containing records of old and new addresses for people who
moved during the last couple of years. The new addresses are provided for
those matched customers. Even though it will not guarantee 100% coverage,
it is far less expensive and faster than other address updating methods (e.g.,
correcting by customer survey).3 Many companies regularly update their cus-
tomer information file through this NCOA service once or twice a year.
</p>
<p>2 Date of birth and address can be converted to &ldquo;age&rdquo; and &ldquo;location&rdquo; and these factors
can be important in predictive models. However, when they have been put in a usable
form, we consider them demographic data.
</p>
<p>3 The standard fee is $3/M with an NCOA hit rate of 3% (Robinson 2002). However,
some vendors charge a fee on a &ldquo;hit per name&rdquo; basis, generally less than 5 cents per
name.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>186 8 Sources of Data
</p>
<p>8.2.2 Demographic Data
</p>
<p>Demographic data spans the kinds of data fields that US Census Bureau
collects every 10 years. They include the age of head of household, family
income, family size, occupation of head of household, marital status, presence
of children, length of residence, education level, own or rent, type of dwelling,
car ownership and its types, gender, race, and so on. For business customers,
they may also include data ranging from the race of the CEO, to the number
of employees, sales volume, years in business, and so on.
</p>
<p>Demographic information is especially useful for targeting prospects. Mar-
keting researchers have found that the best predictors for customers&rsquo; fu-
ture purchase behaviors are their historical purchase/transaction informa-
tion. However, transactional data is mainly available for current customers.
In order to target prospects without any transactions, we need to uti-
lize their demographic (and/or psychographic) characteristics that are ob-
servable to marketers. For example, from current customers we could use
a predictive model to identify what types of demographic characteristics
a high-value customer has. Then we target prospects whose demographic
profiles are similar to those of current high-value customers. And once
prospects become customers, transaction data is collected to fine-tune tar-
geting.
</p>
<p>Most companies often do not have enough demographic information in
their customer information files. It is especially true for companies that have
built customer information files based on legacy databases scattered across
various departments. As discussed later, those companies can enhance cus-
tomer information files through overlaying demographic data provided by
external data providers. Demographic data are available both at individual
or geographical aggregate level. Individual level data are more accurate, but
more expensive, and sometimes are not available. The aggregate data are
the average demographic values of customers living in the same geographic
boundary such as census tracts, ZIP codes, Zip+4, and postal carrier routes.
For example, customer income is usually not available on a customer basis,
since IRS filings are private. In that case, income for individual customers
may be assumed equal to the average for their census tract.
</p>
<p>8.2.3 Psychographic or Lifestyle Data
</p>
<p>Lifestyle is a way of life or style of living that reflects the attitudes and values
of a consumer while psychographics are psychological characteristics of con-
sumers such as attitudes, values, lifestyles, and opinions. Generally, lifestyles
and psychographics are used interchangeably. Specific questions to measure
lifestyles consist of three groups: activities on hobbies, vacation, entertain-
ment, club membership, sports, etc.; interests in family, job, fashion, food,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.2 Types of Data for Describing Customers 187
</p>
<p>media, etc.; opinions on politics, business, economics, educations, products,
culture, etc. (Plummer 1974).
</p>
<p>Product usage or ownership can be classified as psychographic data since
we can infer customers&rsquo; attitude and behavior from their product usage.
For example, Best Buy would like to know its customer&rsquo;s attitude toward
technology, innovativeness, and market mavenism. Best Buy would also like
to know its customer&rsquo;s use of various electronic products, as well as other
products that may be complementary to electronic products. For example,
hiking would be relevant information to know for Best Buy because they
might be able to sell hikers electronic gizmos such as GPS locaters. Database
marketers often purchase consumer &ldquo;response lists&rdquo; to collect these psycho-
graphic information. Consumer response lists are lists of individuals who
have some identifiable product interest (e.g., martial art equipments or digi-
tal cameras) and have a proven willingness to buying by mail (Roberts and
Berger 1999). There are several subcategories of consumer response lists.
Buyer lists (those who have bought a product or service) and subscription
lists (those subscribing to a publication) are most meaningful for database
marketers. For example, the Nordstrom Quality Women Apparel (buyer) list
includes about 500,000 purchasers of apparel from Nordstrom during the past
12 months.
</p>
<p>Lifestyle research has grown out of the limitation of demographic vari-
ables to explain heterogeneous purchase behavior across consumers. Still few
companies are collecting individual lifestyle data for their own database mar-
keting use, partially because of large collection costs, even though they often
purchase some lifestyle information from consumer response lists. However,
database marketers should note that traditional marketing researchers have
successfully used lifestyle data for targeting (or segmenting) prospects for
a long time. It may be valuable to conduct a lifestyle survey for a sample
of current customers and identify what types of lifestyle characteristics a
high-value customer has. Then we might link those lifestyle characteristics
to demographic or transaction data that we have available for all customers.
Through the chain demographic/transaction data &rArr; lifestyle &rArr; customer
value, we can target the customers we want.
</p>
<p>The best-known lifestyle segmentation system is VALS, formerly known
as the Values and Lifestyles Program, developed in 1978 by the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) and now owned and operated by SRI Consulting
Business Intelligence (SRIC-BI). VALS was one of the first major consumer
segmentation programs based on consumer lifestyle characteristics. It corre-
lated people&rsquo;s values about social issues such as abortion rights and military
spending with their product and media preferences. In 1989, VALS was re-
vised. Psychological characteristics such as excitement-seeking were found
to be more powerful predictors of consumer behavior and more stable over
time than social values were. Over the years, many consumer product compa-
nies have used VALS for new product development, positioning and effective
advertising.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188 8 Sources of Data
</p>
<p>VALS classifies American adults into eight distinctive groups: Innova-
tors, Thinkers, Achievers, Experiencers, Believers, Strivers, Makers, and Sur-
vivors. The segments differ in terms of attitudes, decision making patterns,
and purchases of products, services, and media. As shown in Fig. 8.1, the
VALS segments are defined along two fundamental dimensions: primary mo-
tivation (horizontal dimension) and resources available, which is associated
with innovative behavior (vertical dimension). VALS points out that peo-
ple are driven by three powerful primary motivations: Ideals, Achievement,
and Self-Expression. Resources refer to education, income, self-confidence,
health, eagerness to buy things, and energy level. For example, Achiev-
ers have goal-oriented lifestyles and a deep commitment to career and
family. They value consensus, predictability, and stability over risk, in-
timacy, and self-discovery. For more detailed descriptions on VALS, see

<p>8.2.4 Transaction Data
</p>
<p>Transaction data are the most powerful data for predicting future customer
purchase behavior. In fact, scanner data researchers for the last two decades
have developed various models predicting consumer purchase behavior of
packaged goods based on transaction histories. In addition, transaction data
cannot typically be purchased outside.4 Transaction-related data can be col-
lected across various channels through which a company interacts with cus-
tomers. In addition, valuable transaction information can internally be found
in various departments such as customer service, fulfillment, billing, and ac-
counting.
</p>
<p>Generally, transaction data include purchase date, purchased items with
their product categories, sizes, and prices, purchase amount, method of pay-
ment, discount, sales tax, return code, allowances, salesperson ID, and so
on. Interpreting customer transactions more broadly, transactions are the
outcomes of a process: attention, intention, desire, and action. Hence, we
treat any transaction-related information before and/or after the purchase
(e.g., product/service inquiry, Web clickstream data, customer complaints,
customer satisfaction scores) as transaction data.
</p>
<p>Because of data storage and maintenance costs, some companies only save
some part of transaction data or its summary. For example, a typical telecom-
munication company has tens of million customers and each customer makes
several calls a day. The size of calling data easily becomes terabytes in weeks.
</p>
<p>4 Transaction data defined here do not include product usage or ownership information
that can be purchased through consumer response lists. That is, we limit our attention
to the transaction-related information specific to the firm&rsquo;s product or service.</p>

</p>
<p>Hence, instead of saving all calling data, the transaction data are recorded
in summarized quantities (total number of calls made each day, the most
frequently called numbers, etc.). As the data storage and access costs drop,
we expect that more data will be stored in raw form.</p>
<p/>

<p>190 8 Sources of Data
</p>
<p>8.2.5 Marketing Action Data
</p>
<p>Marketing action data and transaction data may be the most important
types of data for efficient marketing strategies and tactics. Marketing action
information covers all marketing efforts directing to customers and prospects
whereas transaction information is their responses to the marketing effects.
For example, if we send out a catalog and the customer responds, the mailing
of a catalog is marketing action data and the response or no response is
transaction data.
</p>
<p>Remember that our ideal objective in database marketing is to find the
optimal set of marketing activities over time that will maximize the cus-
tomer&rsquo;s long-run profit contribution. The control variables in our hands are
marketing activities. Should we send the catalog to a customer? Should the
salesperson visit the customer to cross-sell other products? We can make all
these marketing decisions efficiently if we have records on historical mar-
keting activities and the corresponding customer responses or performances.
Hence, if possible, the two should be linked. Surprisingly, however, not many
companies record marketing action information partially because it is time-
consuming and cumbersome without an automatic recording system. And
it is sometimes difficult to link the marketing activities and the customer
response when the firm employs multiple channels. For example, customer
may receive a catalog and the catalog encourages the customer to buy on the
Internet. So is this purchase matched to the catalog or the Internet? This is
important for companies that want to evaluate their marketing efforts. (See
Chapter 25 for more discussion.)
</p>
<p>Similar to the case of transaction data, marketing efforts are the outcome of
an ongoing interaction process with the customer. Accordingly, the gathering
of marketing action data is an ongoing process. Consider the case of the
life insurance industry. Marketing action data would include the number of
communications sent to customers (or prospects), the kinds of promotional
offers that were delivered, when the salesperson contacted the customer, when
thank you letters were mailed, and any follow-up conducted by the customer-
care department or by the sales representative.
</p>
<p>Marketing data are also very diverse depending on the type of business.
The major marketing activity of a direct marketer is to select a group of
customers out of its house list and send mailing packages to them. The di-
rect marketer should record customer lists of who received each mailing, the
content of mailings such as types of products and amount of discounts, date
of mailing, costs of mailing, etc. Marketing action data can be very complex
when the sources of selling products and services are diverse. For example,
an insurance company may sell its products through the Internet, in-house
or outside telemarketing agency, own sales force or brokers, or alliances with
other financial institutions. Marketing strategies differ across these various
channels, so the types of marketing action data differ as well. In addition,
the difficulty in collecting marketing action data is expected to differ across</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.3 Sources of Customer Information 191
</p>
<p>various channels. Data collection is relatively easy with the Internet. It may
be extremely difficult with brokers because sometimes their sales represen-
tatives do not record their selling activities or, even if they do, they are not
willing to share this information with the insurance company.
</p>
<p>8.2.6 Other Types of Data
</p>
<p>Financial data are especially important for financial institutions and ser-
vice providers who require monthly payments. Some external data providers
supply customer-level financial data. For example, Fair Isaac Inc. has de-
veloped a credit score called a FICO score (Myers Internet 2005). A FICO
score attempts to condense a customer&rsquo;s credit history (e.g., late payments,
amount of time credit has been established, length of time at present resi-
dence, employment history) into a single number representing the financial
risk of the customer. That is, a FICO score is the likelihood that credit users
will pay their bills. There are actually three FICO scores computed by data
provided by each of the three credit bureaus &ndash; Experian, Trans Union, and
Equifax.
</p>
<p>Some companies also include in their customer information files descriptors
they calculate or infer about each customer. These are often derived from
statistical models. Examples are lifetime value, values of RFM, credit score,
up-selling score, cross-selling score, selling productivity, and so on. The actual
score or a decile-ranking may be recorded.
</p>
<p>8.3 Sources of Customer Information
</p>
<p>Once customer information needs have been defined, we list the specific data
fields required to achieve the information objective and determine how to
collect them. The goal is to collect the most accurate or valuable information
as cheaply as possible. Understandably, there is a tradeoff between the value
of information and its acquisition costs.
</p>
<p>Marketing researchers have classified marketing research data into primary
and secondary data (Malhotra 1993). A researcher collects primary data for
the specific purposes of addressing the problem at hand. Collecting primary
data is expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, secondary data are
data that have already been collected for purposes other than the problem
at hand. Secondary data are easier and faster to collect. Secondary data
are classified into two types: internal and external. Internal data are those
generated within the organization for which the research is being conducted,
while external data are generated outside of the organization.
</p>
<p>We use the same topology in classifying sources of customer informa-
tion: internal (secondary) data, external (secondary) data, and primary data.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>192 8 Sources of Data
</p>
<p>As explained, internal data are the cheapest to collect, followed by exter-
nal data and primary data. In contrast, primary data are the most time-
consuming to collect, followed by external and internal data. Hence, when
we collect customer data, first we should look internally. If the data are
there and its accuracy or quality is acceptable, we stop. But if not, we look
for external data sources. And the final medium we rely upon is primary
data.
</p>
<p>8.3.1 Internal (Secondary) Data
</p>
<p>Internal sources should be a starting point for the customer information file.
Most companies have vast amounts of internal data, more than they ex-
pected to have. Data may have been collected and stored for other business
purposes than marketing. For example, order processing or fulfillment sys-
tem may have compiled order-taking channels, inventory availability, and
delivery information. Billing and accounting computer systems may store in-
formation on pricing, sales volume, discounts, and net price paid. Contact
management systems for the sales force often have valuable information on
customer profiles, contact dates, types of promotions offered, and even the
content of conversation. Providing information on customer complaints and
satisfactions, the customer service department is another valuable internal
data source. The marketing and/or sales department stores customer trans-
action histories and records for various marketing activities. An important
but easily ignored source of data that marketing department may have is
prospect data. They may come from participants of sweepstakes, names of
the gift receivers, or names having called the 800 number.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, managers often do not know exactly where the internal
data are stored. Or some of them are not in usable format. This is one of the
reasons why the issue of data warehousing is important. A data warehouse
is the process of assembling data from various sources, transforming and
organizing it into a consistent form for decision-making and providing users
with access to this information (Man 1996). That is, a data warehouse is a
repository of data gathered from various departments for business decision
making. A properly constructed data warehouse provides the company with a
more precise understanding of its customer behaviors. For example, Victoria&rsquo;s
Secret Stores, the US lingerie chain, used to spend too much time collecting
information without thinking about using it (Goldberg and Vijayan 1996). Its
data warehousing efforts allowed them to learn that its system of allocating
merchandise to its 678 shops, based on a mathematical store average, was
wrong. An average store sells equal numbers of black and ivory lingerie while
stores in Miami sells ivory by a margin of 10 to 1.
</p>
<p>In addition, a data warehouse helps the company to become more
customer-centric since data from various functional areas are integrated
around customers. With integrated customer databases, many banks such as</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.3 Sources of Customer Information 193
</p>
<p>BankAmerica Corp. and Bank One Corp. can provide branch and cus-
tomer service employees with comprehensive customer relationship informa-
tion (Barthel 1995). As a result, they can improve customer services by sat-
isfying inquiries about various accounts through a single point of contact. In
addition, data integration allows banks to identify cross-selling possibilities
more readily.
</p>
<p>Typically thousands of users with different needs want to use a data ware-
house. Hence it is not frequently efficient to meet the needs of all users with
a single warehouse. The solution can be a &ldquo;data mart&rdquo; that is a kind of
a departmental data warehouse. A data mart is a specialized system that
stores the data needed for a specific department or purpose (e.g., market-
ing data mart). The (enterprise) data warehouse is the central repository
for all company data with extensive data elements available while a data
mart is considered as a subset of the data warehouse specializing in a nar-
row subject or functional area. For example, the Magazine division of AOL&ndash;
Time Warner may have its own marketing data mart to satisfy its specific
needs. The data mart is created and updated by tapping the enterprise data
warehouse.
</p>
<p>Compared to a data warehouse, the size of a marketing data mart is rel-
atively small, hence the cost of building a marketing data mart is lower and
only several months are required to build it. Recently, however, the size of
many marketing databases is increasing rapidly. Several companies have re-
ported that their marketing data marts are approaching the terabyte level
(Stedman 1997). For example, Fleet Financial Group is building a 1 TB data
warehouse and a 500 GB accompanying marketing database. MCI has 2.5TB
of sales and marketing information and Charles Schwab &amp; Co. has built a
customer data mart close to 1TB. Experiencing performance degradation
due to the size of their marketing data mart, they have negotiated with end
users to include only critical information in the marketing data marts. Often,
they separate the marketing database into even smaller pieces to increase
query performance. For example, MCI has built 16 separate marketing data
marts such that each is smaller than 100GB.
</p>
<p>8.3.2 External (Secondary) Data
</p>
<p>Internal data do not always satisfy the data requirements specified by man-
agers. Therefore, database marketers often purchase external data for two
purposes. First, they may rent (targeted) customer lists for prospecting. Sec-
ond, they may want to augment their customer information files by attaching
various demographic and lifestyle characteristics. This is called data enhance-
ment. To enhance your data, you would send your customer list (with iden-
tification information such as names and addresses) to a list enhancer and
request that a couple of demographic characteristics (e.g., occupation) be
attached to those customers. The list enhancer runs your list through its</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>194 8 Sources of Data
</p>
<p>proprietary database by matching your names/addresses to theirs (Roberts
and Berger 1999). Demographic information would be appended to those cus-
tomers when your customers are on the list enhancer&rsquo;s customer list. The list
enhancer returns back the enhanced data disk to you.
</p>
<p>For marketing researchers, there are many external data sources including
federal and state government, trade associations, commercial data providers,
and marketing research firms (Malhotra 1993). In this section, we will limit
our discussion on external data sources that are more relevant to database
marketers.
</p>
<p>8.3.2.1 US Census Data
</p>
<p>US Census data are an easy and quick external source for enhancing your
customer information file. The Census Bureau conducts a full census every
10 years and now the Census 2000 data is available (www.census.gov). In
order to reduce the burden on citizens by asking too many questions, the
Census Bureau introduced the long form along with the short form. Five out
of six households get a short form containing only the basic demographic
questions while the remaining household is asked to fill out the long form
containing more than 100 questions about its lifestyles and backgrounds.
</p>
<p>The US Census contains very useful information for database marketers.
For example, variables in the census include household income, per capita
income, education level, types of occupations, home values, rent or own,
age of the head of the household, and so on. Individual-level census data
are not available due to privacy concerns. However, geographical aggregate
(average) information is made available to the public. The census data are
available at zip code or block group levels. A block may have as few as 10&ndash;20
families in it, and their demographic characteristics in the same block are
expected to be similar. Some data elements such as population and income
are available at the block group level whereas others (e.g., place of birth by
citizenship status, real estate taxes) are only available at the census track
level.
</p>
<p>Commercial data vendors use census data along with other data to make
these data easier and more convenient for database marketers. Considering
that the census is conducted every 10 years, they also provide the projected
data for each year.
</p>
<p>8.3.2.2 Mapping Data
</p>
<p>Geocoding is the process of assigning latitude and longitude coordinates to a
location. Geomarketing vendors provide geocoding services that can enhance
your customer information files by assigning coordinates to each address, ZIP
code, or ZIP + 4. Before assigning coordinates, they also verify whether the
address is consistent with USPS standard.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.3 Sources of Customer Information 195
</p>
<p>Once the location coordinates are attached to the address records, mapping
software can display the location on the map. Distances can be calculated
between each customer and various store locations. The data can also be use-
ful for presentations and overall understanding of the market from a spatial
location perspective. And if it is integrated with marketing information (e.g.,
customer&rsquo;s demographic characteristics), it can be a valuable tool for both
managers and analysts. For example, mapping can help retailers and banks
to find a location for a new branch.
</p>
<p>8.3.2.3 Individual Level Data
</p>
<p>Several external data vendors provide list enhancement services at the in-
dividual customer level. For example, Donnelly Marketing, a subsidiary of
InfoUSA, has various demographic and lifestyle information for over 225 mil-
lion individuals and 100 million unique households. For each individual or
household, it offers over 250 variables that can be appended to a client&rsquo;s
customer information file. They include gender, age, estimated household
income, home ownership, estimated home value, dwelling type, credit card
information, mail order buyers, auto ownership, ethnicity, marital status,
newlyweds, and so on (see http://www.infoUSA.com).
</p>
<p>InfoUSA also provides list enhancement service for businesses. Extracted
from various sources such as yellow pages, annual reports, leading business
magazines and newspapers, and 17 million phone calls to verify information,
its business database has over 14 million US businesses. Clients can enhance
their business lists with more than 70 variables including type of business,
sales volume, number of employees, the race of CEO, the establishment date,
credit rating, phone number and fax number, and so on.
</p>
<p>There are at least four major vendors competing in the list enhance-
ment business: Acxiom, Experian, Equifax (previously R. L. Polk &amp; Co.),
and InfoUSA. Each vendor is slightly different in compiling its lists ini-
tially. For example, R. L. Polk &amp; Co. complied its lists from the state motor
vehicle registration information along with various public records. Hence,
it has some automobile specialized information such as the make, model,
and year of the automobile owned. Having sold its Consumer Information
Solution group to Equifax, Polk now focuses on the automobile industry
(http://www.polk.com). On the other hand, Donnelley Marketing originally
compiled its lists through telephone and city directories. Now sources of its
lists are expanded to mail order buyers and subscribers, magazine subscribers,
credit information and other public sources. In 1999, Donnelley Marketing
became the wholly owned subsidiary of InfoUSA, which was already a well-
known provider of business databases.
</p>
<p>An innovative way of collecting lifestyle data has been crafted by NDL
(National Demographics and Lifestyles) in the 1970s.5 NDL compiles its
</p>
<p>5 Afterwards, NDL has been acquired by R. L. Polk.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>196 8 Sources of Data
</p>
<p>data by providing warranty card processing services to manufacturers and
retailers. The manufacturer inserts warranty cards in its product packag-
ing along with a lifestyle survey provided by NDL. NDL processes the
data, provides the warranty information with some lifestyle data to the
manufacture, but keeps adding all the information to its customer lifestyle
database.
</p>
<p>Even large compilers can not achieve 100% matches with a typical cus-
tomer database. About 80&ndash;90% of a company&rsquo;s customer lists are covered by
the large compilers (Roberts and Berger 1999). Moreover, for those lists of
names matched, some data elements may not be available at the individual
level. Compilers provide various geographic average values (e.g., ZIP, ZIP+4
or block groups) for those data elements. Understandably, it costs more to en-
hance at the individual level. In addition, some data elements such as income
are often the inferred values that are the outputs of a statistical model. For
example, we can think of an income prediction model where the dependent
variable is income and the independent variables may be the age of household
head, automobile ownership, type and make of the car, home value, types of
occupation, etc. The model is estimated on a group of individuals for whom
individual-level income is available. The model can then be used to predict
income for all households.
</p>
<p>8.3.2.4 Pre-modeled or Cluster Data
</p>
<p>Having applied customer analysis to customer (individual or geographic
level) and business data, some external data providers segment the entire
US population into several groups. Taking hundreds of demographic and
lifestyle variables for each subject, a clustering algorithm attempts to find
a number of clusters such that subjects in the same cluster are as homo-
geneous as possible and, at the same time, subjects in the different clus-
ters are as heterogeneous as possible in terms of their characteristics. Once
the plausible number of clusters is determined, each segment is character-
ized by the average values of its subjects&rsquo; demographic, lifestyle, psycholog-
ical, and media interest. See Chapter 16 for further discussion of &ldquo;cluster
analysis.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>These segment codes can be said to be pre-modeled information in that
they are the output of external data vendors&rsquo; clustering algorithm. They
can save your time and effort in modeling since it is already modeled. Once
you have your customer lists cluster-coded, you can tell to which segment
each customer belongs and enumerate his/her various characteristics based
on the norms for that segment. Clustering information is sometimes crit-
icized because it is too aggregated and/or demographic and lifestyle vari-
ables cannot explain the heterogeneity of purchase behavior among cus-
tomers. For example, you wouldn&rsquo;t expect that the percentage of cat owners
for one cluster would be significantly different than that for other clusters.
However, clustering information is useful for targeting prospects at least.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.3 Sources of Customer Information 197
</p>
<p>Moreover, it helps you to develop appropriate advertising copy and media
selections.
</p>
<p>PRIZM is one of the first demographic and lifestyle based segmentation
schemes (http://www.claritas.com). Developed by Claritas, PRIZM is based
on the principle that &ldquo;birds of a feather flock together.&rdquo; That is, people of
similar demographic and lifestyle characteristics tend to live near each other.
Applying a series of cluster and factor analyses to US Census data, it clusters
census block groups with similar characteristics into 66 neighborhood types,
listed in Table 8.1. With similar profiles in terms of demographic and lifestyle
characteristics, each cluster has a unique name such as Blue Blood Estates,
Furs &amp; Station Wagons, Shotguns &amp; Pickups, and Young Influentials. Once
the customer information file of a client is PRIZM-coded, you can improve
your targeting decision for prospects.
</p>
<p>More recently, Looking Glass has developed a segmentation scheme called
Cohorts. Unlike PRIZM, Cohorts is based on self-reported household level

youngest, a collection of mostly 25- to 34-year-old couples with
large families in new-money subdivisions. Surrounding their
homes are the signs of upscale living: recreational parks, golf
courses and upscale malls. With a median income of nearly
$90,000, Winner&rsquo;s Circle residents are big spenders who like to
travel, ski, go out to eat, shop at clothing boutiques and take in
a show.

<p>GROUP S2: The affluentials
</p>
<p>08 Executive
Suites
</p>

couples typically living just beyond the nation&rsquo;s beltways. Filled
with significant numbers of Asian Americans and college
graduates &ndash; both groups are represented at more than twice the
national average &ndash; this segment is a haven for white-collar
professionals drawn to comfortable homes and apartments
within a manageable commute to downtown jobs, restaurants
and entertainment.
</p>
<p>14 New Empty
Nests
</p>

rest-home retirement. This is the top-ranked segment for
all-inclusive travel packages; the favorite destination is Italy.
</p>
<p>15 Pools &amp;
Patios
</p>
<p>Formed during the postwar Baby Boom, Pools &amp; Patios has
evolved from a segment of young suburban families to one for
mature, empty-nesting couples. In these stable neighborhoods
graced with backyard pools and patios &ndash; the highest proportion
of homes were built in the 1960s &ndash; residents work as
white-collar managers and professionals, and are now at the top
of their careers.

<p>17 Beltway
</p>
<p>Boomers
</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s Baby Boomers are now in their forties and fifties,
</p>
<p>and this segment reflects one group of college-educated,
</p>
<p>upper-middle-class homeowners. Like many of their peers who
married late and are still raising children, these Boomers live in
comfortable suburban subdivisions and are still pursuing
kid-centered lifestyles.
</p>
<p>18 Kids &amp;
Cul-de-Sacs
</p>
<p>Upscale, suburban, married couples with children &ndash; that&rsquo;s the
skinny on Kids &amp; Cul-de-Sacs, an enviable lifestyle of large
families in recently built subdivisions. With a high rate of
Hispanic and Asian Americans, this segment is a refuge for
college-educated, white-collar professionals with administrative
jobs and upper-middle-class incomes. Their nexus of education,
affluence and children translates into large outlays for
child-centered products and services.
</p>
<p>19 Home Sweet
Home
</p>
<p>Widely scattered across the nation&rsquo;s suburbs, the residents of
Home Sweet Home tend to be upper-middle-class married
couples living in mid-sized homes with few children. The adults
in the segment, mostly between the ages of 25 and 54, have
gone to college and hold professional and white-collar jobs.
With their upscale incomes and small families, these folks have
fashioned comfortable lifestyles, filling their homes with toys,
TV sets and pets.
</p>
<p>Group S3: Middleburbs
</p>
<p>21 Gray Power The steady rise of older, healthier Americans over the past
decade has produced one important by-product: middle-class,
home-owning suburbanites who are aging in place rather than
moving to retirement communities. Gray Power reflects this
trend, a segment of older, midscale singles and couples who live
in quiet comfort.
</p>
<p>22 Young
Influentials
</p>
<p>Once known as the home of the nation&rsquo;s yuppies, Young
Influentials reflects the fading glow of acquisitive yuppiedom.
Today, the segment is a common address for young,
middle-class singles and couples who are more preoccupied
with balancing work and leisure pursuits. Having recently left
college dorms, they now live in apartment complexes
surrounded by ball fields, health clubs and casual-dining
restaurants.
</p>
<p>30 Suburban
Sprawl
</p>
<p>Suburban Sprawl is an unusual American lifestyle: a collection
of midscale, middle-aged singles and couples living in the heart
of suburbia. Typically members of the Baby Boom generation,
they hold decent jobs, own older homes and condos, and pursue
cocooning versions of the American Dream. Among their
favorite activities are jogging on treadmills, playing trivia
games and renting videos.
</p>
<p>36 Blue-Chip
Blues
</p>
<p>Blue-Chip Blues is known as a comfortable lifestyle for young,
sprawling families with well-paying blue-collar jobs. Ethnically
diverse &ndash; with a significant presence of Hispanics and
African-Americans &ndash; the segment&rsquo;s aging neighborhoods feature
compact, modestly priced homes surrounded by commercial
centers that cater to child-filled households.

</p>
<p>singles and married couples living in older suburban homes.
</p>
<p>With their high-school educations and fixed incomes, segment
residents maintain an easy-going lifestyle. Residents like to
socialize by going bowling, seeing a play, meeting at the local
fraternal order or going out to eat.
</p>
<p>GROUP S4: Inner suburbs
</p>
<p>44 New
Beginnings
</p>
<p>Filled with young, single adults, New Beginnings is a magnet
for adults in transition. Many of its residents are
twentysomething singles and couples just starting out on their
career paths &ndash; or starting over after recent divorces or company
transfers. Ethnically diverse &ndash; with nearly half its residents
Hispanic, Asian or African-American &ndash; New Beginnings
households tend to have the modest living standards typical of
transient apartment dwellers.
</p>
<p>46 Old Glories Old Glories are the nation&rsquo;s downscale suburban retirees,
Americans aging in place in older apartment complexes. These
racially mixed households often contain widows and widowers
living on fixed incomes, and they tend to lead home-centered
lifestyles. They&rsquo;re among the nation&rsquo;s most ardent television
fans, watching game shows, soaps, talk shows and
newsmagazines at high rates.
</p>
<p>49 American
Classics
</p>
<p>They may be older, lower-middle class and retired, but the
residents of American Classics are still living the American
Dream of home ownership. Few segments rank higher in their
percentage of home owners, and that fact alone reflects a more
comfortable lifestyle for these predominantly white singles and
couples with deep ties to their neighborhoods.
</p>
<p>52 Suburban
Pioneers
</p>
<p>Suburban Pioneers represents one of the nation&rsquo;s eclectic
lifestyles, a mix of young singles, the recently divorced and
single parents who have moved into older, inner-ring suburbs.
They live in aging homes and garden-style apartment buildings,
where the jobs are blue-collar and the money is tight. But what
unites these residents &ndash; a diverse mix of whites, Hispanics and
African-Americans &ndash; is a working-class sensibility and an
appreciation for their off-the-beaten-track neighborhoods.
</p>
<p>GROUP C1: Second city society
</p>
<p>10 Second City
Elite
</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s money to be found in the nation&rsquo;s smaller cities, and
you&rsquo;re most likely to find it in Second City Elite. The residents
of these satellite cities tend to be prosperous executives who
decorate their $200,000 homes with multiple computers,
large-screen TV sets and an impressive collection of wines.
With more than half holding college degrees, Second City Elite
residents enjoy cultural activities &ndash; from reading books to
attending theater to dance productions.
</p>
<p>12 Brite Lites,
Li&rsquo;l City
</p>
<p>Not all of the America&rsquo;s chic sophisticates live in major metros.
Brite Lights, Li&rsquo;l City is a group of well-off, middle-aged couples
who have settled in the nation&rsquo;s satellite cities. Residents of
these typical DINK (double income, no kids) households have
college educations, well-paying business and professional careers
and swank homes filled with the latest technology.

</p>
<p>the home of those legendary Soccer Moms and Dads. In these
</p>
<p>small satellite cities, upper-class families boast dual incomes,
college degrees and new split-levels and colonials. Residents of
Upward Bound tend to be kid-obsessed, with heavy purchases
of computers, action figures, dolls, board games, bicycles and
camping equipment.

</p>
<p>24 Up-and-
Comers
</p>
<p>Up-and-Comers is a stopover for young, midscale singles before
they marry, have families and establish more deskbound
lifestyles. Found in second-tier cities, these mobile,
twentysomethings include a disproportionate number of recent
college graduates who are into athletic activities, the latest
technology and nightlife entertainment.
</p>
<p>27 Middleburg
Managers
</p>
<p>Middleburg Managers arose when empty-nesters settled in
satellite communities that offered a lower cost of living and
more relaxed pace. Today, segment residents tend to be
middle-class and over 55 years old, with solid managerial jobs
and comfortable retirements. In their older homes, they enjoy
reading, playing musical instruments, indoor gardening and
refinishing furniture.
</p>
<p>34 White Picket
Fences
</p>
<p>Midpoint on the socioeconomic ladder, residents in White
Picket Fences look a lot like the stereotypical American
household of a generation ago: young, middle-class, married
with children. But the current version is characterized by
modest homes and ethnic diversity &ndash; including a
disproportionate number of Hispanics and African-Americans.
</p>
<p>35 Boomtown
Singles
</p>
<p>Affordable housing, abundant entry-level jobs and a thriving
singles scene &ndash; all have given rise to the Boomtown Singles
segment in fast-growing satellite cities. Young, single and
working-class, these residents pursue active lifestyles amid
sprawling apartment complexes, bars, convenience stores and
laundromats.
</p>
<p>41 Sunset City
Blues
</p>
<p>Scattered throughout the older neighborhoods of small cities,
Sunset City Blues is a segment of lower-middle-class singles and
couples who have retired or are getting closed to it. These
empty-nesters tend to own their homes but have modest
educations and incomes. They maintain a low-key lifestyle filled
with newspapers and television by day, and family-style
restaurants at night.

<p>47 City

<p>Startups
</p>
<p>In City Startups, young, multi-ethnic singles have settled in
</p>
<p>neighborhoods filled with cheap apartments and a commercial
</p>
<p>base of cafes, bars, laundromats and clubs that cater to
</p>
<p>twentysomethings. One of the youngest segments in America &ndash;
</p>
<p>with ten times as many college students as the national average

<p>concentrations of Hispanics and African-Americans.

<p>Young singles and single parents make their way to Mobility
</p>
<p>Blues, a segment of working-class neighborhoods in America&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>satellite cities. Racially mixed and under 25 years old, these
transient Americans tend to have modest lifestyles due to their
lower-income blue-collar jobs. Surveys show they excel in going
to movies, playing basketball and shooting pool.
</p>
<p>60 Park Bench
Seniors
</p>
<p>Park Bench Seniors typically are retired singles who live in the
racially mixed neighborhoods of the nation&rsquo;s satellite cities.
With modest educations and incomes, these residents maintain
low-key, sedentary lifestyles. Theirs is one of the top-ranked
segments for TV viewing, especially daytime soaps and game
shows.
</p>
<p>62 Hometown
Retired
</p>
<p>With three-quarters of all residents over 65 years old,
Hometown Retired is one of the oldest lifestyles. These racially
mixed seniors tend to live in aging homes &ndash; half were built
before 1958 &ndash; and typically get by on social security and
modest pensions. Because most never made it beyond high
school and spent their working lives at blue-collar jobs, their
retirements are extremely modest.
</p>
<p>63 Family
Thrifts
</p>
<p>The small-city cousin of inner-city districts, Family Thrifts
contain young, ethnically diverse parents who have lots of
children and work entry-level service jobs. In these
apartment-filled neighborhoods, visitors find the streets
jam-packed with babies and toddlers, tricycles and basketball
hoops, Daewoos and Hyundais.
</p>
<p>GROUP T1: Landed gentry
</p>
<p>05 Country
Squires
</p>
<p>The wealthiest residents in exurban America live in Country
Squires, an oasis for affluent Baby Boomers who&rsquo;ve fled the city
for the charms of small-town living. In their bucolic
communities noted for their recently built homes on sprawling
properties, the families of executives live in six-figure comfort.
Country Squires enjoy country club sports like golf, tennis and
swimming as well as skiing, boating and biking.

Small Pond

of Big Fish, Small Pond are often among the leading citizens of
their small-town communities. These upscale, empty-nesting
couples enjoy the trappings of success, belonging to country
clubs, maintaining large investment portfolios and spending
freely on computer technology.
</p>
<p>11 God&rsquo;s
Country
</p>
<p>When city dwellers and suburbanites began moving to the
country in the 1970s, God&rsquo;s Country emerged as the most
affluent of the nation&rsquo;s exurban lifestyles. Today, wealthier
communities exist in the hinterlands, but God&rsquo;s Country
remains a haven for upper-income couples in spacious homes.
Typically college-educated Baby Boomers, these Americans try
to maintain a balanced lifestyle between high-power jobs and
laid-back leisure.

of middle-aged, upper-middle-class households that have started
to empty-nest. Workers here &ndash; and most households boast two
earners &ndash; have well-paying blue- or white collar jobs, or own
small businesses. Today these Baby-Boom couples have the
disposable income to enjoy traveling, owning timeshares and
going out to eat.
</p>
<p>GROUP T2: Country comfort
</p>
<p>23 Greenbelt
Sports
</p>
<p>A segment of middle-class exurban couples, Greenbelt Sports is
known for its active lifestyle. Most of these middle-aged
residents are married, college-educated and own new homes;
about a third have children. And few segments have higher
rates for pursuing outdoor activities such as skiing, canoeing,
backpacking, boating and mountain biking.
</p>
<p>28 Traditional
Times
</p>
<p>Traditional Times is the kind of lifestyle where small-town
couples nearing retirement are beginning to enjoy their first
empty-nest years. Typically in their fifties and sixties, these
middle-class Americans pursue a kind of granola-and-grits
lifestyle. On their coffee tables are magazines with titles
ranging from Country Living and Country Home to Gourmet
and Forbes. But they&rsquo;re big travelers, especially in recreational
vehicles and campers.
</p>
<p>32 New Home-
steaders
</p>
<p>Young, middle-class families seeking to escape suburban
sprawl find refuge in New Homesteaders, a collection of small
rustic townships filled with new ranches and Cape Cods.

these dual-income couples have fashioned comfortable,
child-centered lifestyles, their driveways filled with campers and
powerboats, their family rooms with PlayStations and Game
Boys.
</p>
<p>33 Big Sky
Families
</p>
<p>Scattered in placid towns across the American heartland, Big
Sky Families is a segment of young rural families who have
turned high school educations and blue-collar jobs into busy,
middle-class lifestyles. Residents like to play baseball,
basketball and volleyball, besides going fishing, hunting and
horseback riding. To entertain their sprawling families, they
buy virtually every piece of sporting equipment on the market.
</p>
<p>37 Mayberry-
ville
</p>
<p>Like the old Andy Griffith show set in a quaint picturesque
berg, Mayberry-ville harks back to an old-fashioned way
of life. In these small towns, middle-class couples and families
like to fish and hunt during the day, and stay home and
watch TV at night. With lucrative blue-collar jobs and
moderately priced housing, residents use their discretionary
cash to purchase boats, campers, motorcycles and pickup
trucks.

neighborhood of lower-middle-class singles and couples living in
modestly priced homes. Many are high school-educated seniors
who held blue-collar jobs before their retirement. And a
disproportionate number served in the military; no segment has
more members of veterans clubs.
</p>
<p>42 Red, White
&amp; Blues
</p>
<p>The residents of Red, White &amp; Blues typically live in exurban
towns rapidly morphing into bedroom suburbs. Their streets
feature new fast-food restaurants, and locals have recently

Payless Shoes. Middle-aged, high school educated and
lower-middle class, these folks tend to have solid, blue-collar
jobs in manufacturing, milling and construction.
</p>
<p>43 Heartlanders America was once a land of small middle-class towns, which can
still be found today among Heartlanders. This widespread
segment consists of middle-aged couples with working-class jobs
living in sturdy, unpretentious homes. In these communities of
small families and empty-nesting couples, Heartlanders pursue
a rustic lifestyle where hunting and fishing remain prime leisure
activities along with cooking, sewing, camping and boating.
</p>
<p>45 Blue
Highways
</p>
<p>On maps, blue highways are often two-lane roads that wind
through remote stretches of the American landscape. Among
lifestyles, Blue Highways is the standout for lower-middle-class
couples and families who live in isolated towns and farmsteads.
Here, Boomer men like to hunt and fish, the women enjoy
sewing and crafts, and everyone looks forward to going out to a
country music concert.
</p>
<p>50 Kid Country,
USA
</p>

school-educated and living in tiny apartments in the nation&rsquo;s
exurban towns. With their service industry jobs and modest
incomes, these folks still try to fashion fast-paced lifestyles
centered on sports, cars and dating.

families, Crossroads Villagers is a classic rural lifestyle.

Villagers help put food on the table through fishing, gardening
and hunting.
</p>
<p>57 Old
Milltowns
</p>
<p>With the shrinking of the nation&rsquo;s manufacturing sector,
America&rsquo;s once-thriving factory towns have aged, as have their
residents. Old Milltowns reflects the decline of these small
industrial communities, now filled with retired singles and
couples living quietly on fixed incomes. These home-centered
residents make up one of the top segments for daytime
television.
</p>
<p>58 Back
Country
Folks
</p>
<p>Strewn among remote farm communities across the nation,
Back Country Folks are a long way away from economic
paradise. The residents tend to be poor, over 55 years old and
living in older, modest-sized homes and manufactured housing.
Typically, life in this segment is a throwback to an earlier era
when farming dominated the American landscape.

America

families in small, isolated towns located throughout the nation&rsquo;s
heartland. With modest educations, sprawling families and
blue-collar jobs, many of these residents struggle to make ends
meet. One quarter live in mobile homes. One in three haven&rsquo;t
finished high school. Rich in scenery, Bedrock America is a
haven for fishing, hunting, hiking and camping.

<p>Households that defy classification
</p>
<p>Omegas Omegas are people who are impossible to classify distinctly. They may be
married or single, homeowners or renters, 18&ndash;65 years old, have incomes
that range from very low to six figures, and enjoy numerous and diverse
interests.
</p>
<p>Clients have begun to criticize the nature of the clusters developed by
the external data providers. Purchase behavior observed in financial ser-
vices will be different from purchase behavior in groceries. Different indus-
tries will have different demographic and lifestyle drivers. In the 1980s, Pin-
point has developed FiNPiN, a consumer classification system designed for
the financial service industry (Winters 1993). Several vendors have followed
suit. For example, Claritas introduced its own industry-specific segmenta-
tion product called P$YCLE. Designed for financial institutions, P$YCLE
segments US households into 42 clusters mainly in terms of their financial
behavior. Claritas went one step further and develop a segmentation prod-
uct named LifeP$YCLE for insurance marketers. Claritas gathers household
data from a syndicated survey of 90,000 consumers about their use of financial
services.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>210 8 Sources of Data
</p>
<p>Finally, the segmentation vendors have actively incorporated databases
from other specialty research firms. For example, by utilizing the data from
Nielsen Marketing Research, Simmons Marketing Research Bureau, credit
data, electoral rolls and additional customer survey, vendors can now report
more extensive purchase behavior (e.g., usage pattern for particular products
and services) for each segment.
</p>
<p>8.3.2.5 List Rentals for Prospecting
</p>
<p>Database marketers can increase the efficiency of their customer acquisition
efforts significantly by carefully selecting the right mailing lists for prospect-
ing. For example, a mail order company of women&rsquo;s petite sizes may want
to target only short women (Hatch 1995). Driver&rsquo;s license data from state
motor vehicle bureaus have information on drivers&rsquo; heights and weights. This
mail order company may seek and find a list that contains women and their
heights and weights.
</p>
<p>The list rental industry is very diverse. There is no standard way of cate-
gorizing the different types of lists. Roberts and Berger (1999) classify them
into consumer and business lists first. Alternatively, lists can be categorized
into house lists, response lists and compiled lists. A house list is the list
of customers in the company&rsquo;s own customer information file, while (con-
sumer) response lists are some other company&rsquo;s house list or &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo;
list (Sect. 8.3.2.3). A compiled list is a list of customers compiled from pub-
lic records, phone directories, or professional associations. The reason these
lists are called compiled is that somebody has actually compiled the lists
based on data available typically from various sources. Usually the compiled
list has some common identifiable characteristics and its size is large with
lower unit price. For example, InfoUSA is renting complied lists of 95 million
ethnic individuals, 37 million homeowners, 8.4 million new movers, and so
on. Hence, a compiled list is appropriate for wide market coverage. On the
other hand, a response list is a list of customers who have either purchased
or requested information from specific companies. Its mailing response rates
are expected to be high since consumers in the response list have previously
shown their interests to respond to the mailing. Moreover, there are a wide
variety of response lists available, and customers in each response list often
show interests on particular products and services. For example, subscribers
of a cat magazine will have strong interests in cats. Cat food sellers may want
to rent this subscriber list.
</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of list buyers and sellers. The &ldquo;market&rdquo;
for lists is generally organized as follows:
</p>
<p>The list buyer wishes to purchase a list say for prospecting. The buyer
employs a list broker to find good lists. On the other side, there are own-
ers of lists. This may be a list compiler as described above, or an individ-
ual company. Individual companies often employ list managers who are in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8.3 Sources of Customer Information 211
</p>
<p>charge of selling their customer list. For example, Best Buy may be inter-
ested in attracting customers to its stores with an offer for an Apple IPod.
Crutchfield, an electronics cataloger, has a list of its recent customers. Best
Buy&rsquo;s list broker and Crutchfield&rsquo;s list manager get together and negotiate
terms by which Best Buy may rent Crutchfield&rsquo;s list. Crutchfield of course
may decide not to rent to Best Buy if it thinks Best Buy will steal sales
from them. But if Crutchfield is willing, the broker and list manager nego-
tiate price, terms, etc. The list owner, in this case Crutchfield, then pays
both the broker and the list manager a certain percentage. It is an inter-
esting arrangement. Essentially, the list buyer does not pay directly for the
services of the list broker or list manager. However, one might conjecture
that the list buyer indirectly pays because undoubtedly the fact that the
list owner pays both the broker and the list manager keeps prices relatively
high.
</p>
<p>For years, the list industry was relatively low-tech. Recently, however,
computerized list search engines have appeared. These allow a broker, or the
list buyer, to search directly for lists. One such search engine is Nextmark
(http://www.nextmark.com). See Roberts and Berger (1999) for more detail
about the list rental industry.
</p>
<p>Another way to acquire a prospect list is through list exchange. This
process is managed by companies such as Abacus (http://www.abacus-
us.com). Abacus maintains what they call a cooperative database. Companies
contribute names to the database, and in return can obtain new names from
the database. List exchanges became more accepted during the cash crunch
of the past few years. According to the 2004 Catalog Age Benchmark Report
on Lists, 30% of all respondents have negotiated list exchanges (Del Franco
2004). They were more willing to exchange with non-competitors than com-
petitors. Chen et al. (2001) showed that information sharing (or list exchange)
can be profitable for two competing firms under reasonable conditions.
</p>
<p>8.3.3 Primary Data
</p>
<p>If the data elements are not available from internal or external sources, they
need to be collected directly from a consumer survey. These are costly and
time-consuming, but often worthwhile. We will not discuss various statistical
issues on collecting primary data (survey, focus group and in-depth interview,
observational data, etc.) since they are well documented in traditional mar-
keting research textbooks. Instead, we provide a couple of real world examples
how companies collect their primary data.
</p>
<p>Traditionally packaged goods manufacturers are mass marketers. How-
ever, Quaker has seen the potential of one-to-one marketing. In order to cre-
ate its own customer list, in 1990 Quaker mailed cents-off coupons, each of
which had a unique household number. Analyzing who redeemed coupons and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>212 8 Sources of Data
</p>
<p>when they were redeemed, Quaker could learn customer-level purchase be-
havior for its product. Moreover, this information could be used to customize
advertising and promotion to the unique needs of individual households
(Mollie 1991).
</p>
<p>Philip Morris gives another excellent example. Because of the increasing
restrictions on tobacco advertising, it is necessary for Philip Morris to build its
own customer information file and reach smokers directly. Customers fill out
detailed questionnaires to get free shirts and sleeping bags (Berry 1994). With
its 26 million smokers&rsquo; names and addresses, Philip Morris sends targeted
coupons and asks for grassroots support for their lobbying efforts. Similarly,
Seagram has built its own customer information file and tracked consumers&rsquo;
names and addresses, the brands and types of alcohol they drink, their sex,
birth date, income, and how many bottles they purchase in an average month
(Berry 1994).
</p>
<p>A strategic alliance with credit card companies or Internet portals of-
ten reduces costs of collecting primary data significantly. For example, GM
offered GM credit card with MasterCard in 1992, and, as a result, could
build a customer database with tens of millions of customers. More recently,
several offline-based companies formed strategic alliances with online com-
panies to target online customers and track online customer behaviors. For
example, United Artists Theatre Circuit, one of the largest theater chains in
the USA, made a long-term strategic alliance with AOL (Time Warner 1999).
The alliance allows United Artists efficiently to reach the largest group of
moviegoers in cyberspace.
</p>
<p>Another important use of primary data, perhaps in its infancy, is to use
surveys to gather competitive information (Kamakura and Wedel 2003; Du et
al. 2005). For example, a company could survey its customers and ask them
how often they purchase from a competitor, what competitive products they
own, and what percentage of purchases are from a competitor (&ldquo;share-of-
wallet&rdquo;). They would have these competitive data for just the sample, say
1,000 customers. The company would then run a predictive model to predict
say share-of-wallet as a function of variables it has on all its customers. This
model would then be used to score the rest of the customer file. So each
customer would be scored in terms of their predicted share-of-wallet, i.e.,
what percentage of their business is with the company as opposed to the
competition.
</p>
<p>Du et al. (2005) noted that few firms were collecting competitive infor-
mation. They suggested that the survey-based approach should be utilized
to augment the company&rsquo;s interactions with its customers by adding the in-
ferred competitive interactions. Their empirical analysis indicated that the
volume customers transact within a firm has little correlation with the volume
they transact with the firm&rsquo;s competitors. In addition, a small percentage of
customers account for a large portion of all the competitive transactions,
suggesting considerable potential to increase sales if these customers can be
correctly identified and encouraged to switch.</p>

<p>8.4 The Destination Marketing Company 213
</p>
<p>8.4 The Destination Marketing Company
</p>
<p>Competition among external data providers is getting stiffer as their prod-
ucts and services become less differentiated. In result, data-selling business
has become a low margin business. To differentiate from others and increase
value-added, external data vendors are beginning to integrate downstream
and provide services such as predictive modeling, customer segmentation,
cross-selling modeling, and other marketing consulting services. By provid-
ing selling and marketing research services, in addition to the data that drive
these efforts, these vendors have taken one step further to increase their
value share in the total value chain. We observe that a big marketing broker
is emerging. We call it &ldquo;Destination Marketing Company (DMC).&rdquo; For ex-
ample, Acxiom&rsquo;s business covers list-selling data enhancement, analytic and
marketing services consulting, data quality assessment, and direct mail ful-
fillment service.
</p>
<p>The essential role of the DMC is to connect sellers and buyers. The DMC
is like a big marketing broker. A company can outsource its whole marketing
function to the DMC. For example, a number of companies employ outside
advertising agencies or marketing research companies to assist its marketing
department. Similarly, a company may not need a marketing department by
outsourcing all of its marketing function from the DMC. The DMC attempts
to find potential customers for its products and services, sends communica-
tion messages, and closes the sales. The DMC may be compensated on a
commission basis.
</p>
<p>The DMC has two major resources: customer information and database
marketing knowledge. That is, the DMC should have a huge customer infor-
mation file that consists of individual and business customers, or at least be
particularly astute at obtaining databases from external sources. The DMC
is also knowledgeable in all aspects of database marketing techniques such
as database management and predictive modeling. If a client company asks
the DMC to sell its products, the DMC selects a group of customers from
its customer information file to be predicted to have high probability of pur-
chasing the product. In searching for the most efficient way of selling the
product, the DMC also selects the best communication and sales channel for
each customer. Once the sales are closed, the results are recorded back into
the customer information file.
</p>
<p>Can we find any empirical evidence of an emerging DMC? As discussed,
some external data vendors such as Acxiom and Harte-Hanks are moving in
this direction. Companies have been willing to outsource their advertising and
marketing research function. And some companies use agencies and brokers
to sell their products. However, you can argue that while companies may be
willing to outsource some part of their marketing function, they should be
responsible for the overall marketing strategy, including the target market
and product positioning. Without a solid marketing strategy, products be-
come commodities. For example, the profit margins for OEM manufacturers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>214 8 Sources of Data
</p>
<p>are very low. They may not have enough resources and capabilities to have
their own one-to-one marketing infrastructure but outsource their marketing
to the DMC. Therefore, while the Destination Marketing Company has its
advantages, it can be a consequence, as well as a cause, of a poor marketing
strategy. However, if the DMC is integrated into a firm&rsquo;s marketing group,
and that group has a solid grasp of the big picture, the DMC can be extremely
valuable.</p>

<p>Chapter 9
</p>
<p>Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>Abstract Another cornerstone of database marketing is testing. Testing pro-
vides transparent evidence of whether the program prescribed by sophisti-
cated data analyses actually is successful in the marketplace. Much of the
testing in database marketing is extremely simple &ndash; select 20,000 customers,
randomly divide them in half, run the program for one group and not the
other, compare results. However, there are several issues in designing and
analyzing database marketing tests; we discuss these in this chapter.
</p>
<p>9.1 The Importance of Testing
</p>
<p>Capital One may be the one of the most successful credit card companies to-
day (Cohen 2001). The secret to the success is its test-and-learn management
philosophy that Capital One calls its Information Based Strategy (IBS). Cap-
ital One conducted 45,000 tests in the year 2000, which on average is 120 per
day. For example, once Capital One comes up with an idea for a new product
offering, it attempts to find a target population by testing the new product
with various promotional campaigns to various samples of customers. Based
on the test results, Capital One identifies what types of customers are most
receptive to the new product and what should be the corresponding pro-
motional campaign. It sometimes even conducts additional tests to fine-tune
the strategy. Capital One always makes important marketing decisions (e.g.,
customized pricing, promotion, and packaging) through a series of tests.
</p>
<p>Database marketers should not invest a large amount of company resources
unless its expected benefit is greater than the costs. Frequently it may not be
easy to calculate the expected benefit because the future is uncertain. Unless
you are absolutely sure that it will succeed, you should conduct tests to make
an informed decision. The objective of testing is to obtain more information
before committing a large amount of resources and, hence, reduce the risk of
possible failure. The field of database marketing is particularly amenable to
tests because companies have addressable customer databases and hence can
</p>
<p>215</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>216 9 Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>randomly assign its customers to various treatment conditions, and observe
the results.
</p>
<p>While Capital One is the acknowledged leader in database marketing tests
and is known for extensive use of testing, most database marketers consider
testing an integral part of the way they do business. Database marketers test
various decisions including media choice, the development of promotional
campaign, the selection of mailing lists, choice of message format, and so on.
Moreover, the decision-making process is really &ldquo;closed-loop.&rdquo; A campaign is
revised based on a test, the modified campaign is tested, then implemented,
and then the results are used to suggest further tests, and so on. That is,
information learned from a test or from full-scale campaigns become inputs to
the next tests, which in turn feed the next round of testing and full campaign
roll-outs.
</p>
<p>9.2 To Test or Not to Test
</p>
<p>Probably the first question that should be asked before conducting a test is
the most basic &ndash; should a test be conducted? As discussed, testing provides
information to aid in making correct management decisions. However, infor-
mation is usually obtained at a cost. Testing costs may include the cost of
time delay as well as its administrative cost. For example, to assess the benefit
of a loyalty program or a churn management program, one really should run
the test for about a year. This is typically not practical. The database mar-
keter must think through whether useful information can be gleaned from a 1
or 2-month test. Hence the decision to collect information or data can be an-
alyzed to see if the expected benefit of the information exceeds its collection
costs.
</p>
<p>We discuss two approaches for deciding whether to run a test. The first
is based on decision analysis and is called the &ldquo;Value of Information.&rdquo; This
potentially quantifies how much the database marketer should be willing to
spend on a test. The second approach, &ldquo;Assessing Mistargeting Costs,&rdquo; is
more conceptual, but provides a framework for thinking about whether or
not to conduct a test.
</p>
<p>9.2.1 Value of Information
</p>
<p>Testing provides information. In this section we discuss the fundamental con-
cepts in quantifying the value of information. We first study a decision tree
that is very useful for understanding complex decision-making problems. Us-
ing the decision tree, we show how to calculate the &ldquo;value of perfect informa-
tion&rdquo; and then extend to the problem of computing the &ldquo;value of imperfect
information.&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.2 To Test or Not to Test 217
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.1 Decision tree for calculating the expected value of a new product launch.
</p>
<p>Consider a problem of a new product introduction. The average probabil-
ity of new product success is known to be 30%. That is, without collecting
any additional information on the new product, the success probability of
the new product is 30%, and its failure probability is 70%. Suppose that a
firm would make $1,000 if the new product succeeds and lose $500 if it fails.
Should the firm introduce the new product? If the firm does not introduce
the new product, the payoff is $0. On the other hand, if the firm decides to
introduce the new product, it will succeed with probability 0.30 and gain a
payoff of $1,000 and fail with probability 0.70 and obtain a payoff of &minus;$500.
As a result, the expected value or payoff for the new product introduction is
&minus;$50 (= $1, 000 &times; 0.3&minus; $500 &times; 0.7). Therefore, the firm should not intro-
duce the new product. The decision tree shown in Fig. 9.1 summarizes these
calculations.
</p>
<p>Decision trees are a graphical way to organize the probabilistic computa-
tions leading to the best decision. We draw the decision tree starting with
a decision. Should the firm introduce the new product? The decision fork
shown as the square box in Fig. 9.1 has two arrows (or alternatives) com-
ing out: introduce or not introduce. We now evaluate the payoffs from each
alternative. The outcome of the first alternative or &ldquo;not introduce&rdquo; is $0.
The payoff from the second branch is more complicated to calculate. If the
firm decides to introduce the new product, the payoffs will be determined by
chance. We represent this as a circle &ndash; called the chance fork &ndash; distinguished
from the decision fork. Two possible outcomes branching from &ldquo;introduce&rdquo;
are &ldquo;success&rdquo; or &ldquo;failure.&rdquo; The new product will succeed by 30% of the time
and fail 70% of the time. The payoff given &ldquo;success&rdquo; is $1,000 and the payoff
given &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is &minus;$500. Hence the &ldquo;expected value&rdquo; or payoff from introduc-
ing the new product is &minus;$50 (= $1, 000&times;0.3&minus;$500&times;0.7). Since the expected
payoff of &ldquo;not introduce&rdquo; ($0) is larger than that of &ldquo;introduce&rdquo; (&minus;$50), the
firm should not introduce the new product.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>218 9 Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>Fig. 9.2 Decision tree for assessing the value of perfect information.
</p>
<p>9.2.1.1 Value of Perfect Information
</p>
<p>We next consider a case of conducting a test to aid in making decision on
introducing a new product. We first consider the value of the perfect test
(or information). The perfect test can forecast with 100% accuracy whether
the new product will succeed or fail. Figure 9.2 shows the decision tree to
determine whether we conduct a test.
</p>
<p>If we do not conduct the test, we will not introduce the new product
(because the expected value of launching the product is &minus;$50 as calculated
above) so that the corresponding payoffs will be $0. However, if we decide
to conduct a test, the payoffs will be determined by chance. There is a 30%
chance that the new product will actually be a success and 70% chance it
will be a failure. Assume the test can perfectly predict whether the new
product will succeed or fail. If the new product is forecasted to succeed in
the test, it will actually succeed. The firm should then introduce the new
product and the resulting payoff will be $1,000. Alternatively, if the new
product is predicted to fail in the test, it will actually fail. The firm should
then not introduce the new product, and the corresponding payoff will be $0.
Therefore, the expected payoff becomes $300(= $1, 000 &times; 0.3 &minus; $0 &times; 0.7).
The value of perfect information (or the perfect test) is $300 since the
payoff increases from $0 to $300 by conducting the test. In other words,
the firm should conduct the perfect test unless its cost is greater than
$300.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.2 To Test or Not to Test 219
</p>
<p>9.2.1.2 Value of Imperfect Information
</p>
<p>Information provided by a test is rarely perfect. The test cannot provide per-
fect information for several reasons including small sample size, measurement
errors, and so on. Going back to the problem of new product introduction,
we assume that the test provides imperfect information. Assume the test cor-
rectly forecasts 90% of the time when the new product will actually succeed.
So the test will say &ldquo;failure&rdquo; 10% of time for the would-be successful new
product. In addition, if the new product will actually fail, the test is assumed
to predict that the new product will fail 80% of the time, and wrongly forecast
that it will succeed 20% of times. What is the value of information provided
by this imperfect test?
</p>
<p>Before we proceed into the decision tree for imperfect information, let
us briefly calculate some important preliminary probabilities. We are able
to calculate the joint probability of test results (&ldquo;Success&rdquo; or &ldquo;Failure&rdquo;)
and actual results (Success or Failure) by multiplying these two proba-
bilities. For example, the (joint) probability that the test says &ldquo;success&rdquo;
and the new product will actually succeed as P (Product is a Success &amp;
Test says &ldquo;Success&rdquo;) = P (Success &amp; &ldquo;Success&rdquo;) = P (Product is a Suc-
cess) &times;P (Test says &ldquo;Success,&rdquo; given that the product actually is a success) =
(0.3)&times; (0.9) = 0.27. Similarly, P (Product is a Success &amp; Test says &ldquo;Failure&rdquo;)
is (0.3)&times; (0.1) = 0.03 while P (Failure &amp; &ldquo;Success&rdquo;) = 0.14 and P (Failure &amp;
&ldquo;Failure&rdquo;) = 0.56.
</p>
<p>From these four joint probabilities, we can calculate the probability that
the test says that the new product is a &ldquo;success&rdquo; or &ldquo;failure.&rdquo; The probability
the test says the product will succeed, P (&ldquo;Success&rdquo;), equals P (Product is a
Success &amp; Tests says &ldquo;Success&rdquo;) + P (Product is a Failure &amp; Test says
&ldquo;Success&rdquo;) = 0.27 + 0.14 = 0.41. The test will say 41% of the time that the
new product is a &ldquo;Success.&rdquo; When the test says the new product will be a
&ldquo;Success,&rdquo; about 66% of the time (= 0.27 &divide; 0.41) the product will actually
succeed, but 34% of the time (= 0.14 &divide; 0.41), it will fail. Similarly, P (Test
says &ldquo;Failure&rdquo;) is 0.59 (= 0.03 + 0.56). The test will say 59% of the time
that the new product is a &ldquo;Failure.&rdquo; And when the test says &ldquo;Failure,&rdquo; about
5% of the time (= 0.03 &divide; 0.59) it will instead succeed and 95% of the time
(= 0.56&divide; 0.59) it will fail.
</p>
<p>Now we are ready to draw the decision tree for imperfect information.
Similar to the case of perfect information, the firm has a decision making
problem of whether to conduct a test. The payoffs will be $0 if the firm does
not conduct a test. Note that the firm should not introduce the new product
without additional information provided by the test. However, if the firm
decides to conduct a test, the payoffs will be determined by chance. Figure 9.3
summarizes the decision tree to determine whether we conduct a test.
</p>
<p>Given conducting a test, there is a chance fork where P (&ldquo;Success&rdquo;) = 0.41
and P (&ldquo;Failure&rdquo;) = 0.59. That is, the test will say 41% of times that the new</p>

</p>
<p>product is a &ldquo;Success&rdquo; and 59% of times that the new product is a &ldquo;Failure.&rdquo;
If the test predicts &ldquo;Success,&rdquo; the firm will face another decision making prob-
lem of whether to introduce the new product or not. As computed before,
if the test predicts &ldquo;Success,&rdquo; there is a 66% (= 0.27 &divide; 0.41) chance it will
actually succeed, but a 34% (= 0.14&divide; 0.41) chance it will fail. The expected
value of introducing the new product if the test says &ldquo;Success&rdquo; is $488 (=
$1, 000 &times; 0.66&minus;$500 &times; 0.34). As a result, the firm should introduce the new
product when the test predicts &ldquo;Success.&rdquo; Similarly, if the test predicts &ldquo;Fail-
ure,&rdquo; the firm will face a decision making problem of whether to introduce
the new product or not. If the test predicts &ldquo;Failure,&rdquo; there is a 5% chance
(= 0.03 &divide; 0.59) it will instead succeed and a 95% chance (= 0.56 &divide; 0.59) it
will actually fail. Hence, the expected value of introducing the new product
if the test says &ldquo;Failure&rdquo; is &minus;$425 (= $1, 000 &times; 0.05 &minus; $500 &times; 0.95). As a
result, the firm should not introduce the new product when the test predicts
&ldquo;Failure.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Combining the above results, if the test says &ldquo;Success,&rdquo; the firm should
introduce the new product and its expected profit is $488. Alternatively, if
the test forecasts &ldquo;Failure,&rdquo; the firm should not introduce the new product
and its expected value is $0. In addition, P (Test says &ldquo;Success&rdquo;) = 0.41 and
P (Test says &ldquo;Failure&rdquo;) = 0.59. Hence, the expected profit from conducting
the imperfect test is $200 (= $488 &times; 0.41 + $0 &times; 0.59). That is, the payoff
increases from $0 to $200 by conducting the imperfect test. Note that it is less
than the value of perfect test ($300). The firm should conduct the imperfect
test unless its cost is greater than $200.</p>

<p>9.2 To Test or Not to Test 221
</p>
<p>The above illustrates a decision-theoretic technique for deciding whether
the company should launch a product. The test might be a direct mail
offer announcing the product, so this is very relevant to database mar-
keting. The tree-approach is logical and provides a nice &ldquo;picture&rdquo; of the
decision-making problem. However, it requires key inputs, for example, the
probability that the test will say &ldquo;Success&rdquo; if indeed the product will suc-
ceed, etc. These probabilities typically must be assessed judgmentally. This
may seem a bit disconcerting, but the decision-theoretic viewpoint is that
managers internally weigh these chances anyway when deciding whether to
conduct a test. The value of information approach merely asks the man-
ager to write down those assumptions explicitly and then &ldquo;play out&rdquo; rig-
orously the implications of those assumptions on what the manager should
decide.
</p>
<p>9.2.2 Assessing Mistargeting Costs
</p>
<p>Another way to view the question of whether to test is as follows: There
is a correct or optimal decision to make. However, we may not make that
optimal decision for two reasons: (1) We decide to conduct a test and the
test involves wrong decisions for some or all of the customers involved in
the test. This is called the mistargeting costs of the test, or MTtest. (2)
We roll out what we think is the optimal action on our entire customer
base and it turns out to be the wrong decision. This is what we call mis-
targeting costs of the rollout, or MTrollout. We therefore have the following
formula:
</p>
<p>Π = Optimal Profit&minus;DCtest &minus;MTtest &minus;MTrollout (9.1)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Π = Total profit
Optimal Profit = Profit if the company takes the correct action
DCtest = Direct costs of the test
MTtest = Mistargeting costs of the test
MTrollout = Mistargeting costs of the rollout
</p>
<p>For example, a company may need to decide whether to cross-sell Product
A or Product B to its customers. There is a correct decision &ndash; Product A,
B, or neither &ndash; but we don&rsquo;t know which is correct. The direct cost of a test
would include administrative costs, the cost of delaying actions that may
allow competitors to move faster, and the cost of contacting people for the
test, etc. MTrollout would be the deviation we get from optimality because
we cross-sell the wrong product or cross-sell when neither of the products
are profitable. MTtest would be the cost we would incur by taking wrong</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>222 9 Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>actions during the test. For example, we might randomly select three groups
of customers, each of sample size n, and cross-sell Product A to Group I,
Product B to Group II, and neither to Group III. For one of these groups,
we&rsquo;ve made the right decision, but for two groups we have made the wrong
decision. The mistargeting costs occur because for two of the groups, we&rsquo;ve
wasted resources and may not be able to cross-sell these customers again for
this particular campaign (e.g., if you contact the customer for Product A,
you can&rsquo;t go back to them later to cross-sell product B).1
</p>
<p>The level of mistargeting costs will be lower if (1) we have good prior
knowledge on the correct course of action, (2) there is low variation in the
possible value of a response if the customer responds, and (3) there is low
variation in the possible response rates that might be obtained. That is, if
there are only a limited number of possible values for the value of response
and the response rate, and we have a good prior on it anyway, mistarget-
ing costs will be low. In addition, MSrollout will be lower to the extent
that we&rsquo;ve conducted a large test, i.e., have a large sample size, because
then we&rsquo;re more likely to learn the correct action and won&rsquo;t mistarget on
the test. We can summarize these thoughts in the following extension of
Equation 9.1:
</p>
<p>Π = Optimal Profits&minus;DCtest(n)&minus; f(Priors, σV , σp)
&times;n&minus; g(Priors, σV , σp, n)&times; (N &minus; n) (9.2)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>f(&bull;) = Mistargeting cost per participant in test
g(&bull;) = Mistargeting cost per customer in rollout
N = Total size of customer base
n = Total number of customers participating in the test
</p>
<p>Given our discussion above, f(&bull;) and g(&bull;) will both decline as a function of
strong priors on the correct action, but increase if there is wide variation in
the possible value of a response or the response rate itself.
</p>
<p>Equation 9.2 provides the following insights:
</p>
<p>&bull; The purpose of a test is to transfer mistargeting costs from the full rollout
to a test. The mistargeting costs in the test are incurred on a smaller subset
of customers (n &lt;&lt; N), but we learn from the test (g(&bull;) is decreasing in
</p>
<p>1 We are implicitly assuming that the test &ldquo;destroys&rdquo; the experimental units. If the cus-
tomers in a test could be included in the full rollout, MTtest would be much smaller.
</p>
<p>But this is often not the case. Consider a credit card test where Groups A and B are
</p>
<p>randomly selected to receive two different cards. The optimal credit card might turn
</p>
<p>out to be the Group B card. But to then go back to Group A and offer them that
card would present problems. First, some of them would have signed up for the Group
A card. Second, the Group B card may be perceived differently by the Group A cus-
tomers because they saw the Group A card first. Third, the company may wish to avoid
&ldquo;cluttering&rdquo; their customers, so may rule out tested customers from the full rollout.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.3 Sampling Techniques 223
</p>
<p>n) so that mistargeting costs in the rollout are minimized, and these lower
costs are multiplied by a large number (N &minus; n).
</p>
<p>&bull; If we have strong prior information on the right course of action, we need
not test because we&rsquo;re pretty sure of the right answer. So why incur the
direct costs of testing plus the mistargeting cost of taking the wrong action
with one of our experimental groups in the test (MTtest)?
</p>
<p>&bull; If there is wide variation in possible values of either the value of a re-
sponse or the response rate, then we should test, because there is then a
huge plus or minus around the mistargeting costs we could incur with a
rollout.
</p>
<p>&bull; Too little testing (e.g., small n or not many treatment groups) can hurt
because we don&rsquo;t learn enough from the test to decrease mistargeting costs
for the rollout. On the other hand, too much testing (e.g., high n or
too many treatment groups) can also hurt because we&rsquo;ll incur a lot of
mistargeting costs on the test and even though we&rsquo;ll probably learn the
correct course of action, we won&rsquo;t be able to apply the lower mistarget-
ing costs on the rollout to enough customers (N &minus; n will not be large
enough). So there is probably a middle-ground to be taken with regard to
testing.
</p>
<p>Hypothetically, Equation 9.2 could be quantified, but we see its value as a
framework for providing guidance of whether or not to test. The above bullet
points highlight the insights generated from the framework. Generally, a test
should be run if (1) prior information on the correct course of action is not
available or not reliable, (2) there is wide variation in the possible value of
a response, (3) there is wide potential variation in the response rate, (4) the
direct costs of running the test, in terms of time, administrative, and contact
costs, are low, and (5) the number of customers and treatments needed to
learn much from the test is not a significant fraction of our total customer
base. For example, if our total customer base is 30,000 and we are thinking
of response rates in the range of 1%, we may want to test three groups of
5,000. But that means 15,000 customers are involved in the test, and that is
a significant proportion of our total customer base. We could calculate some
scenarios depending on potential response value or response rate, but testing
half a company&rsquo;s customer base means the direct costs are probably high,
and we may only be able to apply our learning to the untested half of our
customer base.
</p>
<p>9.3 Sampling Techniques
</p>
<p>Once we define the population and sampling units for a test, we draw one or
more samples from the population. Broadly classifying, there are two types
of sampling techniques: probability sampling and nonprobability sampling.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>224 9 Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>9.3.1 Probability Versus Nonprobability Sampling
</p>
<p>A probability sample is where customers (&ldquo;sampling units&rdquo;) are selected by
chance, and, hence every customer in the population has a known chance of
being selected for the sample (Boyd et al. 1981). A probability sample can be
implemented objectively since customers are selected strictly at random. This
probabilistic selection allows us to measure sampling error and consequently
make statistical inferences based on the results.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, a nonprobability sample is where samples are not se-
lected randomly. Here one selects customers based on the researcher&rsquo;s judg-
ment, convenience, or other nonrandom process. Since subjectivity is involved
in the sampling process, we cannot determine the probability of each customer
being included in the sample. As a result, we cannot measure sampling error
and there is a high risk that statistical inference based on a nonprobability
sample will be biased.
</p>
<p>There are various types of nonprobability samples including convenience
sampling, judgmental sampling, quota sampling, snowball sampling, etc.
These samples are frequently used in survey research due to lower sampling
costs and faster sample collection, even though they are statistically inferior
to a probability sample. On the other hand, most database marketers use the
probability samples. Typical database marketers have customer information
files and, hence, are able to select random samples quickly and cheaply.
</p>
<p>9.3.2 Simple Random Sampling
</p>
<p>We focus now on the probability sample. Several kinds of probability sam-
ples are in common use. Varying in terms of efficiency, they include simple
random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling
and others. High efficiency means that, for the same sample size, a parame-
ter is estimated more accurately, i.e., the standard error of its estimate is
lower. Generally, sampling efficiency is positively related to sampling cost.
Given the sampling budget, database marketers should select the most effi-
cient sampling technique.
</p>
<p>Simple random sampling is the most popular probability sampling tech-
nique. Most statistical inference assumes that observations are collected by
simple random sampling. With an accurate list of all the firm&rsquo;s customers
or prospects, it is cheap and easy to implement. In simple random sampling,
every items/names has an equal chance of being included in the sample. That
is, simple random sampling is similar to a lottery system. If we sample n items
without replacement from the population of size N , this probability is n/N .
</p>
<p>Let us explain how simple random sampling works from an illustration.
Suppose a database marketer has 10 customers in her customer information
file. She wants to select two customers by simple random sampling. To draw a</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.3 Sampling Techniques 225
</p>
<p>simple random sample, each of ten customers (in the population) is assigned
a unique identification number, one through ten for example. Next a random
number (r1) is generated from a 0&ndash;1 uniform distribution. If 0 &le; r1 &lt; 0.1,
then we select the first customer. We select the second customer for 0.1 &le;
r1 &lt; 0.2, the third for 0.2 &le; r1 &lt; 0.3, and so on. After we select the first
customer for the sample, another random number (r2) is generated from a
0&ndash;1 uniform distribution. A customer is selected among the remaining nine
customers. If 0 &le; r2 &lt; 1/9, then we select the first customer. We select the
second customer for 1/9 &le; r2 &lt; 2/9, the third for 2/9 &le; r2 &lt; 3/9, and so on.
</p>
<p>Sample selection of size n from the population of size N can be similarly
done. Fortunately to database marketers, most commercial software such as
SAS have a built-in function of implementing simple random sampling. All
database marketers need to do is specify a simple command for performing
simple random sampling.
</p>
<p>9.3.3 Systematic Random Sampling
</p>
<p>Even though simple random sampling will be representative on average, there
is still a chance it could yield an un-representative sample, especially if the
sample size is small. Hence, many database marketers prefer employing other
sampling techniques that provide higher statistical efficiency (without incur-
ring not much additional costs) than simple random sampling. An alternative
sampling technique frequently used by database marketers is systematic sam-
pling. Systematic sampling provides an easy way to implement a simple ran-
dom sampling. Moreover, it is often more efficient than simple random sam-
pling, as explained below.
</p>
<p>Let us illustrate systematic sampling by an example. Suppose we want
to sample n out of the population size N . First, we determine the sampling
interval (k) by rounding N/n to the nearest integer. Next, we randomly
select a starting point and select every kth item successively in the target
population. For example, ifN is 1,000 and n is 100, then the sampling interval
k should be 10.2 Then an item between 1 and 10 is randomly selected. If this
number is 8, the sample of 100 customers will consist of customer 8, 18, 28,
and up to 998.
</p>
<p>Systematic sampling is statistically more efficient than simple random
sampling when the ordering of elements in target population is related to
the variable of interest. For example, if the customer information file is or-
dered with respect to their cumulative purchase amounts, systematic sam-
pling will evenly select customers with various purchase amounts. It increases
the sample representativeness. On the other hand, a simple random sam-
pling may be unrepresentative because it may sample only heavy users or
</p>
<p>2 Systematic sampling is often called a Nth name sampling in direct marketing applica-
tions. Here N represents a sampling interval k.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>226 9 Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>a disproportionate number of heavy users. However, if the population is or-
dered in a way unrelated to the variable of interest &ndash; for example, customers
ordered alphabetically &ndash; systematic sampling will provide almost identical
sampling error to simple random sampling (Malhotra 1993).
</p>
<p>Systematic sampling yields a probability sample in that every element
in the target population has a known and equal chance of being included
in the sample. It is the most popular sampling technique among database
marketers since it is frequently more efficient than simple random sampling
without incurring additional costs.
</p>
<p>9.3.4 Other Sampling Techniques
</p>
<p>There are other probability sampling techniques such as cluster sampling,
stratified sampling, area sampling, sequential sampling, etc. These are not
very popular among database marketers, but among survey researchers.
</p>
<p>Researchers often use cluster sampling rather than simple random sam-
pling to save on survey costs. In cluster sampling, samples are selected in
groups. For example, suppose a researcher needs a sample of 1,000 represen-
tative US customers for in-depth personal interviews. Simple random sam-
ples will provide 1,000 customers who live all over the country. It is not
economically sensible to interview 3 customers in New York, 5 in Los Ange-
les, and so on. In cluster sampling, the USA is divided into several clusters
or blocks &ndash; using zip codes, for example. And randomly select a manage-
able number of clusters, say 10, and select 100 customers for each of the
selected cluster. Cluster sampling will significantly reduce the sampling costs
by selecting a small number of clusters in the first stage, but there is a
danger of sample misrepresentation. Customers in a block or a cluster tend
to be similar in demographic characteristics. Hence, if clusters covering big
metropolitan cities are only selected in the first stage, customers selected from
those clusters in the second stage may not be representative of average US
customers.
</p>
<p>The goal of stratified sampling is to increase statistical efficiency by in-
creasing the sample representativeness. Database marketers are beginning to
use this sampling more frequently today. Stratified sampling first divides the
target population into several segments with respect to one or more com-
mon characteristics and then randomly selects customers from each one of
these segments. For example, the customer base might be segmented several
groups based on profitability, a segment below $200, a segment of $200&ndash;300,
and so on. Stratified sampling guarantees more representative samples with
respect to the criterion used to segment the target population. Statistical
efficiency will be greater when the customers within each segment are more
homogeneous. There are several strategies of stratified sampling. The most
popular is the proportional allocation which uses a sampling fraction in each
of the strata proportional to that of the total population. For example, if</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.4 Determining the Sample Size 227
</p>
<p>the population consists of 70% in the female stratum and 30% in the male
stratum, the relative size of the two samples should reflect this proportion.
See Lehmann et al. (1998) for more details on stratified as well as cluster
sampling.
</p>
<p>9.4 Determining the Sample Size
</p>
<p>Determining the test sample size is not an easy task. Marketers are interested
in knowing the true parameter value (e.g., response rate for the direct mail
offer) for the target population. Considering the cost of testing, they take
small samples from the target population and attempt to estimate the true
parameter. The larger the sample size, the closer the estimate will be to the
true parameter value. However, the larger sample size increases the cost of
testing (see Sect. 9.2.2). There is a trade-off between the accuracy of the test
results and the cost of conducting tests.
</p>
<p>In order to determine the optimal sample size, marketers need to consider
various qualitative and quantitative factors including the cost/benefit of the
correct decision-making, the level of prior knowledge for the true parameter
value, the (expected) incident/response rates, the desired level of precision,
etc. For example, larger sample size will be preferred if the benefit of correct
decision-making is great.
</p>
<p>Considering the complexity of determining the sample size, several authors
have often provided some practical guidelines. For example, Schmid (1995)
has suggested a rule of thumb, so-called the Rule of 100. It says that one
should have a minimum of 100 responses for each cell. According to this
rule, if you expect a 2% response, the sample size should be at least 5,000 to
get 100 responses. Alternatively, Levin and Zahavi (1996) suggest that the
sample size should be around 10% of the size of the population.
</p>
<p>Although these heuristic rules are practically simple in determining the
sample size, there is no compelling evidence on why these rules correctly
yield an optimal sample size. In essence, these rules intentionally ignore var-
ious factors influencing the optimal sample size in order to provide a simple
guidance to practitioners.
</p>
<p>9.4.1 Statistical Approach
</p>
<p>A more formal method to determine the sample size is based on traditional
statistical inference. Most marketing research textbooks provide the statisti-
cal formula to determine the sample size required to achieve a given level of
precision at a desired level of confidence (Tull and Hawkins 1993). The for-
mula generally is provided in two forms: one for the estimation of means
(e.g., mean order amount) and the other for proportions (e.g., response</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>228 9 Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>probability). The sample size for mean can be derived from the following:
</p>
<p>z = (X &minus; &micro;)/σX = D/σX =
D
</p>
<p>σ/
&radic;
n
</p>
<p>(9.3a)
</p>
<p>where z is the &ldquo;z-value&rdquo; from the standard normal distribution corresponding
to the desired level of confidence, X is the sample mean, &micro; is the population
mean, σX is the standard error of the sample mean, σ is the population
standard error, D is the level of precision, and n is the sample size. Similarly,
in the case of proportions, we use the following formula:
</p>
<p>z = (p&minus; π)/σp = D/σp = D&radic;
π(1&minus; π)/n (9.3b)
</p>
<p>where p is the sample proportion, π is the population proportion, and σp is
the standard error of the sample proportion. From Equations 9.3a, b, we can
solve for the sample size for the sample mean and the sample proportion to
achieve a given level of precision (D) at a desired level of confidence (z):
</p>
<p>Sample size for estimating means: n = σ2z2/D2 (9.4a)
Sample size for estimating proportions: n = π(1&minus; π)z2/D2 (9.4b)
</p>
<p>For example, the population (or true) response rate for the catalog (π) is 1%.
And the cataloger wants 95% confidence (hence, its z-value is 1.96) and allows
the error (of the estimate) to be within 20% of the population response rate.
Then, the optimal sample size should be about {(0.01)(0.99)(1.96)2}/{(0.2)
(0.01)}2 &asymp; 9, 508.3
</p>
<p>If more than 10% of the population is included in the sample, the finite
population corrections to the above formula are often applied. That is, the
correction factor should be incorporated into Equations 9.3a, b as in the fol-
lowing.
</p>
<p>z =
D
</p>
<p>σ
&radic;
(N &minus; n)/(N &minus; 1)/&radic;n (9.5a)
</p>
<p>z =
D&radic;
</p>
<p>π(1&minus; π)&radic;(N &minus; n)/(N &minus; 1)/&radic;n (9.5b)
where N is the size of the population. Solving Equations 9.5a, b with respect
to n, we have:
</p>
<p>nc =
nN
</p>
<p>N + n&minus; 1 (9.6)
</p>
<p>3 Note Equation 9.4b, the case of proportions, is somewhat paradoxical because it says
we need to know the true response rate, π, in order to figure out the sample size we
need to estimate π! However, often managers have some idea what to expect for a
response rate. For example, if one were trying to estimate the response rate to a direct
mailing, and management was willing to assume the response rate will be approximately
1%, the value πo = 0.01 would be inserted in Equation 9.4b, where πo is the a priori
&ldquo;guesstimate&rdquo; of the true proportion π.</p>

<p>where nc is the adjusted sample size and n is the unadjusted sample size in
Equations 9.3a, b. Note that the population size is very large, no correction
is required since nc &asymp; n.
</p>
<p>One needs to determine three unknown values to determine the optimal
sample size statistically: the population variance, the degree of confidence,
and the desired level of precision. Estimates of the population variance, σ2
</p>
<p>or π(1 &minus; π), sometimes are available from similar previous studies (for the
case of proportions, see footnote 3). If there is no secondary source, one
may conduct a pilot study or simply rely on researcher&rsquo;s judgment. The two
other unknowns are determined based on the researcher&rsquo;s subjective judg-
ment. That is, we need to specify the level of precision (D) that is the max-
imum permissible difference between the sample mean/proportion and the
population mean/proportion. We also need to specify the z value associated
with the confidence level. For example, for a 95% confidence level, the prob-
ability that the difference between the population mean/proportion and the
sample mean/proportion will be within the specified precision is 95%. The
corresponding z value is 1.96. Table 9.1 shows the samples sizes required to
estimate the population proportion π at a level of precision D.
</p>
<p>In various database marketing applications, the level of confidence is typ-
ically assumed to be 95% (corresponding to z = 1.96). The true proportion
π depends on application, but a response probability of 1% is not unusual in
direct mail solicitations. The level of precision D may be acceptable if it is
within 20% of the actual proportion. For example, given the true response
rate of 10%, the estimated response rate of 8&ndash;12% is acceptable. Table 9.1
indicates that the optimal sample sizes for a typical database marketing ap-
plication should be in the 1,000s, not 100s.
</p>
<p>Summarizing, the statistical way of determining the sample size is theo-
retically sound. However, it is not very practical in that three unknown pa-
rameters should be specified quite subjectively to determine the sample size.
</p>
<p>9.4.2 Decision Theoretic Approach
</p>
<p>Considering both the statistical properties of the test samples and the eco-
nomic factors, Pfeifer (1998) has proposed a practical method to determine</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>230 9 Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>the optimal sample size. His approach is decision-theoretic in that the optimal
sample size is considered a business decision and, hence, the economic trade-
offs should be carefully evaluated for the increase of sample size. Here we
briefly describe Pfeifer&rsquo;s approach to determining the sample size. Even
though Pfeifer applied the approach to a (direct) test-mailing problem, it
can easily be applied to other database marketing situations.
</p>
<p>9.4.2.1 Problem Definition
</p>
<p>A direct marketer needs to decide the number of names to mail in a test
(the sample size = n) from a total of N names (the size of population = N).
The fixed cost for the test mailing is A and its unit variable cost is C. Let r
be the number of responses from the test mailing and V be the net present
value to the firm for a given response. Once r is observed, the direct marketer
will decide whether to send the mail to the remaining N &minus; n names in the
population. The fixed and variable cost for the rollout mailing is reasonably
assumed to be the same as in the test mailing. Let rR be the number of
responses to the rollout mailing and VR be the net present value to the firm
for the corresponding rollout response.
</p>
<p>9.4.2.2 Prior Response Probability
</p>
<p>The key parameter of Pfeifer&rsquo;s model is the uncertain population response
rate, π. The population response rate is the unknown probability that a
randomly chosen name will respond to the offer. From her experience, the
direct marketer is assumed to have a prior distribution for π. More specifically,
Pfeifer assumes that the prior distribution of π follows a beta distribution
with parameters a = n0π0 and b = n0 (1&minus; π0).
</p>
<p>f(π) =
πa&minus;1(1&minus; π)b&minus;1
</p>
<p>B(a, b)
, 0 &le; π &le; 1, a &gt; 0, b &gt; 0 (9.7)
</p>
<p>The parameters a and b, or n0 and π0, are the means by which the direct
marketer expresses her prior knowledge on the population response rate π.
These two parameters are the required inputs to determine the optimal sam-
ple size in Pfeifer&rsquo;s model. The parameter π0 may be interpreted as the direct
marketer&rsquo;s best guess for the population response rate and the parameter n0
as the level of uncertainty in her guess.4 The prior information incorporated
in π0 and n0 is equivalent to the information that can be obtained from π0n0
responses out of the (test) mailing to n0 customers. For example, suppose
</p>
<p>4 The mean of a beta distribution is a(a+ b)&minus;1 = π0. Hence, π0 can be regarded as the
direct marketer&rsquo;s best guess for the population response rate. Similarly, the variance of
a beta distribution is ab(a + b)&minus;2(a + b + 1)&minus;1 = π0 (1 &minus; π0)(n0 + 1)&minus;1. Hence, n0
measures the level of uncertainty.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.4 Determining the Sample Size 231
</p>
<p>that 1,000 customers receive catalogs and 20 customers respond. Then the
population response rate is estimated to be π0 = 0.05 and the variance of
π0 is πo(1&minus; πo)/no = (0.05)(0.95)/1, 000. Therefore, values of π0 = 0.05 and
n0 = 1, 000 would mean that the decision-maker was 95% confident the true
response rate was somewhere within &plusmn;1.96&radic;(0.05&times; 0.95)/1, 000 = &plusmn;0.018
of π0 = 0.05.
</p>
<p>Given the prior distribution on π, the direct marketer sends test mailings
to n names and gets r responses. Observing the test mailing results, the direct
marketer updates her estimate on π. Her updated probability forecast of π
or the posterior distribution of π can be written as
</p>
<p>f(π|n, r) = π
r+a&minus;1(1&minus; π)n&minus;r+b&minus;1
B(r + a, n&minus; r + b) (9.8)
</p>
<p>9.4.2.3 Calculating the Expected Rollout Profit
</p>
<p>The direct marketer will decide whether to roll out to the remaining N &minus; n
names in the population after she gets the test mailing results. The profit
from the rollout is
</p>
<p>ProfitR = VRrR &minus; (N &minus; n)C (9.9)5
</p>
<p>A risk-neutral marketer will roll out if the expected rollout profit, E(ProfitR),
is greater than zero. Hence, we compute the expected number of responses
from the rollout mailing, E(rR). Noticing that rR is distributed as a beta-
binomial, its mean can be written as (Johnson and Kotz 1969)
</p>
<p>E(rR) = (N &minus; n) r + a(r + a) + (n&minus; r + b) = (N &minus; n)
r + n0π0
n0 + n
</p>
<p>(9.10)
</p>
<p>Therefore, the expected rollout profit is
</p>
<p>E(ProfitR) = VRE(rR)&minus; (N &minus; n)C = (N &minus; n)
[
VR
</p>
<p>n0π0 + r
n0 + n
</p>
<p>&minus; C
]
</p>
<p>(9.11)
</p>
<p>As mentioned, the direct marketer should roll out the population if
E(ProfitR) &gt; 0. Hence, the direct marketer should roll out the list if
</p>
<p>r &gt; C(N &minus; n)(n0 + n)[VR(N &minus; n)]&minus;1 &minus; n0π0 (9.12)
Let r&lowast; be the smallest integer that satisfies the Equation 9.11. Then the direct
marketer should roll out if the number of responses from the test mailing is
greater than and equal to r&lowast; and should not if the number is less than r&lowast;.
</p>
<p>5 Pfeifer (1998) included the fixed cost term for test mailing (A) in Equation 9.9. However,
we delete it to simplify our exposition. Our key results do not change without the fixed
cost. In addition, Pfeifer himself mentioned that fixed costs can be negligible if the test
mailing is included as part of a regular mailing.</p>

<p>232 9 Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>9.4.2.4 Selecting the Optimal Sample Size
</p>
<p>In order to determine the optimal test sample size, let us consider the ex-
pected profit including both the test and the rollout mailing. If r &lt; r&lowast; for
the test mailing result, the direct marketer will not roll out and, hence, the
profit (from the test) becomes ProfitT = V r &minus; nC. Alternatively, if r &ge; r&lowast;
for the test mailing result, the direct marketer will roll out. And the result-
ing profit (from both the test and the rollout) becomes ProfitT + ProfitR =
V r &minus; nC + VRE(rR) &minus; (N &minus; n)C. That is, the total profit is a function of
r. Since the probability distribution of r is the beta-binomial, the expected
(total) profit becomes
</p>
<p>E(ProfitT + ProfitR|n)
</p>
<p>=
r&lowast;&minus;1&sum;
r=0
</p>
<p>g(r|n)(V r &minus; nC) +
n&sum;
</p>
<p>r=r&lowast;
g(r|n)[V r &minus; nC + VRE(rR)&minus; (N &minus; n)C]
</p>
<p>= V nπ0 &minus; nC +
n&sum;
</p>
<p>r=r&lowast;
g(r|n)[VR(N &minus; n)(n0π0 + r)(n0 + n)&minus;1 &minus; (N &minus; n)C]
</p>
<p>(9.13)
</p>
<p>where g(r|n) is the beta-binomial density for r.
</p>
<p>9.4.2.5 Illustrative Example
</p>
<p>Given the test sample size n, the direct marketer can calculate the expected
profit from Equation 9.13. To find the optimal sample size, the direct marketer
evaluates Equation 9.12 for various candidate values of n and selects the one
that maximizes the expected profit. Let us provide an illustrative example
given by Pfeifer (1998). A house list consists of 50,000 customers and it costs
$1 to mail. The direct marketer&rsquo;s best guess for the population response
rate (π0) is 2% and the corresponding level of uncertainty (n0) is assumed
to be 200. With this prior specification, Pfeifer implicitly assumes that the
response rate of a given house list is a randomly drawn number from a beta
distribution with π0 = 2% and n0 = 200. The responses to the mailing are
worth $50 each. So mailing to all 50,000 customers in the list will result in
$0 expected profit. It will cost $50, 000 (= $1&times; 50, 000) which is equal to the
expected revenue of $50, 000 (= $50&times; 2%&times; 50, 000). Without a test mailing,
the direct marketer will be indifferent between mailing to all 50,000 customers
and doing nothing.
</p>
<p>The values of the parameters in Equation 9.12 are all determined. The
appropriate parameter values are: N = 50, 000, C = $1, V = VR = $50, π0 =
0.02 and n0 = 200. Figure 9.4 shows the plots of expected profits as a function
of the test sample sizes n. It indicates that a test sample size of about 2,000
maximizes the expected profit. The expected profit with the test sample of</p>

<p>Fig. 9.4 Test sample size versus expected profit using Pfeifer (1998) Model (From Pfeifer
1998).
</p>
<p>0 is $0, because the expected response rate of a house list is the breakeven
response rate. Also, the expected profit is $0 if the test sample size N =
50, 000, because there would then be no rollout and the expected profits
for the test would just depend on the expected response rate which is at
breakeven. For any test sample sizes between 0 to 50,000, we have the option
of rolling it or not based on the sample information from the testing results.
If the test indicates the full roll-out will not be unprofitable, the manager will
lose money on the test but avoid the even larger loss of an incorrect roll-out.
However, if the test indicates the full roll-out will be profitable, the manager
makes money on the test and then makes even more on the full launch. That
is, there is 50% chance that the test results suggest the full roll-out and 50%
chance that the test results suggest no roll-out. But we lose some money
when the test results are bad, whereas we can make big money when the test
results are good. As a result, the manager on average makes money through
testing, and the optimal test size is about 2,000 out of a population of 50,000,
or 4%.
</p>
<p>It also is important to note that the expected profit numbers that emerge
from this analysis combine subjective and objective information. In a classical
statistical sense, the expected profits could be a biased estimate of the true
expected profits if the manager&rsquo;s prior for the response rate does not on
average equal the true response rate. For example, if the manager&rsquo;s prior
is overly optimistic, and overly confident in that prior, the test information
will have little impact on the updated response rate and the expected profits
will be overly optimistic. However, it can be argued that managers learn the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>234 9 Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>average response rates across lists, and so their prior is not overly optimistic,
and if they are not confident in the performance of the particular list to be
tested, they can indicate low confidence through a small value for n0.6
</p>
<p>9.4.2.6 Extending Pfeifer&rsquo;s Model
</p>
<p>This approach is very promising but could be extended in several ways. Fore-
most would be the incorporation of a control group. Note that the method
assumes a rollout should occur if the expected profit from the rollout is
greater than zero. However, this assumes that if no action is taken, no profit
is generated. This may be the case for a direct marketer who is thinking
of a program of contacting people who are not current customers, which is
the orientation of Pfeifer&rsquo;s paper. But if the company has current customers,
there will be profits from those customers even if the action is not taken. For
example, if Product A is not cross-sold to the customer, the customer may
buy it anyway through a different channel. These profits are uncertain as are
the profits that might accrue from directly contacting the customer. There-
fore there is uncertainty if the action is taken or not taken. This necessitates
a control group. The question then becomes, what should be the size of the
test group and the control group. Control groups are often used in testing
and it seems the above approach could be extended to this situation.
</p>
<p>Another extension would be to incorporate uncertainty in the value of
the customer, V . If the decision is whether to send a catalog, V represents
customer expenditure given the customer responds. This number will also be
uncertain. An extension would be to incorporate priors on this quantity as
well. Obviously, the more diffuse those priors are, the higher sample size will
be needed.
</p>
<p>In summary, Pfeifer&rsquo;s approach is a practical tool for deciding sample size,
directly applicable to customer acquisition tests. Extending the method as
discussed above would provide important and interesting avenues for future
research. It also should be noted that the usefulness of the model hinges on the
validity of the manager&rsquo;s prior. If the manager states a highly optimistic prior
with great certainty, he or she is likely to calculate positive expected profits
from a roll-out no matter what the test results, and lose money. The key
point is that the expected profit calculations are a combination of objective
evidence from the test and subjective judgment encompassed in the prior, and
therefore essentially a subjective judgment of expected profits. Having noted
this limitation, the model is still valuable because managers use judgments
all the time in deciding whether to undertake a full roll-out. The model
merely captures those judgments rigorously and calculates the implications
for profitability.

</p>
<p>9.5 Test Designs
</p>
<p>Experimental research generally consists of three phases: the experimental or
planning phase, the design phase, and the analysis phase. In this section we
focus our attention on the design phase and somewhat on the analysis phase.
Once the objective of the research is set in the planning phase, the research
problem should be expressed in terms of a testable hypothesis. For example,
a cataloger would like to know whether the new catalog design increases the
response rates among current customers. A mobile telecommunication service
provider wants to know whether churn rates are higher among customers aged
below 25. It is then time to design the experiment. In this section we study
the test designs that are most popular among database marketers.
</p>
<p>9.5.1 Single Factor Experiments
</p>
<p>Single factor design is the simplest test design and is fundamental for under-
standing more complex designs. This section discusses single factor experi-
ments in which no restrictions are placed on randomization. Randomization
refers to the random assignment of sample units to experimental (or control)
groups by using random numbers. Treatment conditions are also randomly
assigned to experimental groups. For example, a credit card company is con-
templating whether to make a promotional offer to increase card usage. It
comes up with an idea of offering coupons on gas purchases. Ten randomly
selected customers are given $5 coupons and another ten randomly selected
customers are offered $10 coupon on gas purchase. It randomly selects an
additional ten customers who do not receive any promotional offers. This is
called a control group.7 The card usages of 30 customers for a month after
the experiment are shown in Table 9.2. Then single factor model becomes
</p>
<p>Yij = &micro;+ τj + εij (9.14)
</p>
<p>where Yij represents the ith observation (i = 1, 2, . . . , nj) on the jth treat-
ment (j = 1, 2, . . . , k). For example, the third observation in control condition
(Y31) is 600 in Table 9.2. &micro; is a common effect for the whole experiment, τj
is the treatment effect of jth condition, and εij is a random error.
</p>
<p>We usually assume that the error term εij is distributed as i.i.d. normal
with zero mean and the common variance. That is, εij &sim; N(0, σ2). It is also
assumed that the sum of all treatment effects is zero, or
</p>
<p>&sum;k
j=1 τj = 0. To
</p>
<p>7 In practice, a control group is defined as the group that receives the current level of mar-
keting activity or receives no treatment at all. A control group is included to ascertain
the true incremental effect of the treatments versus no treatment. For example, cus-
tomers still use credit cards without promotional coupons. Hence, the true experimental
effect of promotional coupon offers is the incremental card usage from the promotional
coupon over the credit card usages among the control group customers.</p>

<p>describe the basics of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), we rewrite
Equation 9.14:
</p>
<p>Yij = &micro;+ (&micro;.j &minus; &micro;) + (Yij &minus; &micro;.j) or Yij &minus; &micro; = (&micro;.j &minus; &micro;) + (Yij &minus; &micro;.j) (9.15)
where &micro;.j is the expected value of Yij given the customer receives treatment
j. Comparing Equations 9.14 and 9.15, the jth treatment effect τj can be
represented by &micro;.j &minus; &micro;.
</p>
<p>Since the means in Equation 9.15 are not known, they are estimated from
the nj observations for each treatment condition j. These observations can be
used to estimate the grand mean &micro; and the treatment means &micro;.j . Restating
Equation 9.15 in terms of &ldquo;sample means,&rdquo; we obtain:
</p>
<p>Yij &minus; Y .. = (Y .j &minus; Y ..) + (Yij &minus; Y .j) (9.16)
where Y .. is the sample (grand) mean over all observations, Y .j is the sample
mean over the observations with treatment condition j. The equation says</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9.5 Test Designs 237
</p>
<p>that the deviation of each observation from the overall mean consists of two
parts: the deviation of the treatment mean from the overall mean and its
deviation from its own treatment mean.
</p>
<p>Taking squares and summations of Equation 9.16, we have:
</p>
<p>k&sum;
j=1
</p>
<p>nj&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>(Yij &minus; Y ..)2 =
k&sum;

</p>
<p>j=1
</p>
<p>nj&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>(Yij &minus; Y .j)2 (9.17)
</p>
<p>The term in the left is called the total sum of squares while the first term
in the right is called the between groups/treatments sum of squares and the
second term is called the within groups sum of squares or the error sum
of squares. Equation 9.17 says that the total sum of squares is equal to the
between groups sum of squares plus the error sum of squares.
</p>
<p>The main interest in single factor experiment is to test whether there are
treatment effects. That is, we conduct a one-way analysis of variance test
where the hypothesis to be tested is H0: τj = 0 for all j. If the hypothesis is
accepted, we conclude that there are no treatment effects and all the varia-
tions in the dependent variable Yij are explained by the grand mean &micro; and
the random error εij .
</p>
<p>Going back to the Equation 9.17, it can be shown that the between-group
sum of squares divided by its degree of (k&minus;1), called mean squares, is distrib-
uted as chi-square. Similarly, the error sum of squares divided by its degree
of freedom
</p>
<p>&sum;k
j=1 (nj &minus; 1) = (N &minus; k) is also distributed as chi-square. And
</p>
<p>since these two chi-squares are independent, their ratio can be shown to be
distributed as F with degrees of freedom, (k &minus; 1) and (N &minus; k). Therefore, if
H0 is true, we can test the hypothesis by evaluating the following quantity.
</p>
<p>Fk&minus;1,N&minus;k =
</p>
<p>k&sum;
j=1
</p>
<p>nj&sum;

</p>
<p>(Yij &minus; Y .j)2/(N &minus; k)
(9.18)
</p>
<p>The quantity in the numerator becomes larger when the deviations of the
treatment means from the grand mean become larger. Hence, we reject the
null hypothesis if the quantity in the Equation 9.18 is larger than the critical
region F1&minus;α, where α is the designated significance level.
</p>
<p>An one-way analysis of variance is applied to the credit usage data in
Table 9.2 and its results are summarized in Table 9.3. The test statistic for

</p>
<p>9.5.2 Multifactor Experiments: Full Factorials
</p>
<p>Database marketers often need information on a wide variety of strategic is-
sues. For example, a credit card company manager attempts to devise an op-
timal promotional package to increase credit card usages among current cus-
tomers. She has more than one tactic of interest. For example, there might be
three tactics, or three factors to test in the experiment: (1) the use of coupons
for gas purchases, (2) the use of cash rebates, and (3) the use of &ldquo;affinity&rdquo;
cards. The manager is interested in the impact of all three of these marketing
strategies on credit card usage rate. One method is to hold all other factors
constant except one and observe the effects over several levels of this chosen
factor. Alternatively, one can perform a full-factorial experiment in which all
levels of a given factor are combined with all levels of every other factor.
</p>
<p>A full-factorial experiment is superior to the one-at-a-time experiment
in several aspects (Hicks 1982). A factorial experiment will provide greater
statistical efficiency since all data are used in computing the effect of each
factor. In addition, we can evaluate interactions among factors with a factor-
ial experiment. This design component is particularly important because we
frequently observe synergistic effects among marketing variables.
</p>
<p>To see how a full-factorial experiment works, let us again consider an
example of a credit card company that is considering a promotional offer
to increase the card usage. Now the manager wants to look at the effects
of two promotional variables on card usage: coupons for gas purchases and
a cash rebate for credit card usage. Three levels of coupon amount ($0, $5
and $10) and two levels of cash rebate (0% and 1%) are considered. That
is, it is a 3 &times; 2 factorial experiment, yielding six possible combinations of
coupon amount and rebate level. Five customers are randomly selected at
each of these six treatment conditions. Table 9.4 shows the (monthly) credit
card usage of these 30 customers after the experiment.
</p>
<p>The mathematical model for this experiment can be written as
</p>
<p>Yijk = &micro;+ τjk + εi(jk) (9.19)</p>

<p>where the subscript j(j = 1, 2, 3) represents the levels of coupon amounts, the
subscript k(k = 1, 2) represents the levels of cash rebates and the subscript
i(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) represents the number of observations/customers for each
treatment condition j and k. For example, Y422 is 650 in Table 9.4. Similar to
the single-factor experiment, &micro; is the grand mean for the whole experiment,
τjk is the treatment effect for jth coupon condition and kth rebate condition,
and εi(jk) is a random error.
</p>
<p>Treating each treatment condition as unique, the model in Equation 9.19
does not consider the factorial or multifactor nature of the experiment. That
is, we apply a one-way ANOVA to the data in Table 9.4 and summarize the
results in Table 9.5a.
</p>
<p>The test statistic for the hypothesis H0: τjk = 0 for all j = 1, 2, 3 and
k = 1, 2 is F &lowast; &asymp; 54.0 (= 122, 687.5/2, 270.8) that is statistically significant
at the significance level of 1%. Hence, we reject the hypothesis and conclude
that there are statistically significant differences in credit card usages among
different coupon offers and cash rebates.</p>

<p>We can slightly modify Equation 9.19 to represent the multi-factor nature
of the factorial experiments. Decomposing τjk into the main effect of coupon
treatment condition (Cj), the main effect of cash rebate treatment condition
(Rk), and their interactions (CRjk), Equation 9.19 can be rewritten as
</p>
<p>Yijk = &micro;+ Cj +Rk + CRjk + εi(jk) (9.20)
</p>
<p>The two-way ANOVA is the appropriate tool to analyze the model in Equa-
tion 9.20, the general model for a two-way factorial experiment. The main
interests in two-way factorial experiment are three tests: (1) whether there
is a main treatment effect of coupon (H0 : Cj = 0 for all j = 1, 2, 3), (2)
whether there is a main treatment effect of cash rebate (H0 : Rk = 0 for all
k = 1, 2), and (3) whether there is an interaction effect between coupon and
cash rebate (H0 : CRjk = 0 for all j = 1, 2, 3 and k = 1, 2). If the hypothesis
H0 : Cj = 0 is accepted, we conclude that coupon amounts on gas purchase
will not affect on credit card usage. Similar conclusions will be derived from
other tests.
</p>
<p>We apply a two-way ANOVA to the data in Table 9.4 and summarize the
results in Table 9.5b.
</p>
<p>The between group sum of squares in Table 9.5a (613,437.5) is now de-
composed into three sums of squares in Table 9.5b: between coupons sum
of squares (258,875), between rebates sum of squares (229,687.5) and the
coupons &times; rebates interaction sum of squares (124,875). Table 9.5b also shows
that each of the two main effects and the interaction effect are statistically
significant at the 1% level.
</p>
<p>The significant coupons &times; rebates interaction implies that a change in one
factor produces a different change in the response variable at one level of the
other factor than at the other levels of this factor. The interaction can be
more clearly seen in Fig. 9.5 where the mean card usages (over each of five

the mean card usages are $450 for no coupons, $500 for $5 coupons, $520
for $10 coupons. On the other hand, with 1% cash rebates, the mean card
usages are $475 for no coupons, $660 for $5 coupons, $860 for $10 coupons.
That is, there exist positive synergies between coupons and cash rebates. Or
coupons are more effective when they are used with 1% cash rebates. If there
are no coupons &times; rebates interactions, the card usage plot of no cash rebates
should be parallel to the card usage plot of 1% cash rebates.

<p>9.5.3 Multifactor Experiments: Orthogonal Designs
</p>
<p>A full-factorial experiment is very useful to database marketers since several
factors are simultaneously considered and, hence, all interaction effects can be
identified. However, as the number of factors considered in a factorial exper-
iment increases, the number of treatment conditions increases very rapidly.
For example, it is not unusual for database marketers to consider 5 factors
where each factor has three levels. The number of treatment conditions for
this factorial experiment is 245 (= 35). It is not economical &ndash; sometimes, it is
not even feasible &ndash; to assign customers to each of 245 treatment conditions. In
order to overcome this problem, researchers use &ldquo;fractional factorial&rdquo; designs,
where only a fraction of all possible treatment combinations is selected for</p>

<p>testing (Hicks 1982). In fractional factorial designs one willingly gives up the
measurement of all possible interaction effects and obtains a smaller number
of treatment conditions.
</p>
<p>A special class of fractional factorial designs, called orthogonal arrays,
is a highly fractional design in which all main effects can be identified al-
though all interaction effects are assumed to be negligible (Green 1974).
Widely used in conjoint analysis experiments, orthogonal arrays are known
to be the most parsimonious set of designs (in the sense of the lowest num-
ber of treatment conditions) available for estimating main-effect parame-
ters. For example, we consider an experiment with 9 factors where each
factor has two levels. Hence, the number of treatment conditions for the
full factorial experiment is 512 (= 29). Table 9.6 shows an orthogonal ar-
ray for this experiment that was provided by Addelman (1962). In the case
of orthogonal arrays a necessary and sufficient condition for the main ef-
fects of any two factors be uncorrelated (unconfounded) is that each level
of one factor occurs with each level of another factor with proportional
frequency.
</p>
<p>Assuming that all interaction effects can be neglected, we can reduce the
number of treatment conditions from 512 to 16. With relatively few treat-
ment combinations, orthogonal arrays allow us to estimate all main effects
on an unconfounded basis for a dozen or more factors, each at two or three
levels.
</p>
<p>The concept of &ldquo;confounding&rdquo; is important in fractional designs and merits
some elaboration. Assume we have a three-factor experiment where we want
to test three treatments, each at two levels. Let&rsquo;s say the experiment is for
a credit card and the factors are coupon (yes or no), rebate (yes or no), and</p>

<p>affinity card (yes or no). A full factorial experiment would have 23 = 8 combi-
nations. Let&rsquo;s assume eight combinations are impractical for the researcher so
we want to design an experiment with just four combinations. Table 9.7 shows
two possible designs. Which is the better design? Experiment 1 runs into the
problem of &ldquo;confounding.&rdquo; The confounding is between the Coupon and Re-
bate. With this experiment, we will not be able to differentiate the impact
of the coupon from that of the rebate, because every treatment group that
gets a coupon also gets a rebate, and every group that does not get a coupon
does not get a rebate. If card usage is higher for groups 1 and 2, we don&rsquo;t
know if it due to the coupon or the rebate. There is no way to differentiate
these effects. In contrast, Experiment 2 has no confounds between any pairs
of the three factors. If treatment groups 1 and 2 have higher usage rates, that
can be interpreted as due to the coupon, because treatment groups 1 and 2
both always have coupons but sometimes have rebates or affinities and some-
times not. Similarly, groups 3 and 4 never have a coupon but sometimes have
rebates or affinities and sometimes not. Experiment 2 is the preferred design.
</p>
<p>Lists of orthogonal designs (e.g., Table 9.6) are provided by Plackett and
Burman (1946) and Addelman (1962), making it easier to develop orthogonal
arrays. SPSS also provides a routine for creating orthogonal arrays.
</p>
<p>The price of the orthogonal array is that it assumes there are no interac-
tion effects, whereas there may be interaction effects as we saw in the credit
card example. Another way to state the assumption is that the orthogonal
array cannot differentiate between a main effect and various interactions, so
we just assume there are no interactions and that the main effects we estimate
just reflect main effects and nothing else. This is somewhat troublesome but
often main effects are clear and important, and interactions are indeed sec-
ondary. There are in fact intermediate-type fractional factorial designs where
a fraction of all possible combinations are selected so that at least some of
the interactions can be estimated (see Winer 1971 for a thorough treatment).
These fractional factorials of course will require more treatments.
</p>
<p>9.5.4 Quasi-Experiments
</p>
<p>As the name implies, a quasi-experiment is almost a true experiment. A
quasi-experiment is where we are unable to fully manipulate the scheduling</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>244 9 Test Design and Analysis
</p>
<p>or assignment of treatments to test units (Malhotra 1993). There are many
types of quasi-experiments, but their common feature is that the assignment
of treatments to customers is not controlled by the researcher.
</p>
<p>Quasi-experiments are therefore used in database marketing when it is
difficult to randomly assign customers to treatment conditions. For example,
we may want to evaluate the impact of a customers&rsquo; participation in a reward
program on their purchase frequencies. We offer the reward program to all
customers and let customers decide whether they participate the program or
not. Suppose that 40% of customers participate and the rest do not. Monthly
purchase dollars before and after launching the rewards program are mea-
sured. Program participants increase their purchase dollars from $100 to $120
as a result of the rewards program. Purchase dollars of non-participants are
also increased from $90 to $100. Non-participants in this quasi-experiment
serve as the control set. Hence, we may conclude that customers increase
their purchase dollars by ($120&ndash;100)&minus; ($100&ndash;90) = $10 due to their program
participations. However, this conclusion is misleading since customers were
not randomly assigned between program participants and non-participants.
There could be a self-selection bias whereby the customers who self-selected
into the rewards program were pre-disposed to buy from the company anyway
(see Chapter 11, Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling). A true experimen-
tal design would approach this situation by dividing customers randomly into
participants and non-participants. The random assignment would eliminate
concerns for selection bias.
</p>
<p>One way of reducing the selection bias in quasi-experiments is to introduce
covariates in analyzing the experimental effect. This is called the analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA). ANCOVA tries to control statistically for factors that
influence purchase frequency besides membership in a rewards program. One
can also develop a formal selectivity model (see Chapter 11, Statistical Issues
in Predictive Modeling).
</p>
<p>In summary, quasi-experiments are in general less preferred because one
loses the randomization of the true experiment. Randomization rules out
other factors as causes (on average) and particularly addresses selection bias.
However, in the real world, one may not have the luxury of randomizing. In
that case, the researcher at a minimum should use an analysis of covariance
framework, and consider formulating a formal selectivity model.</p>

<p>The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>Abstract The third cornerstone of database marketing (the other two being
LTV and testing) is predictive modeling. Predictive modeling is the use of
statistical methods to predict customer behavior &ndash; e.g., will the customer
respond to this offer or catalog? Will the customer churn in the next 2
months? Which product in our product line would be most attractive to the
customer? Which sales channel will the customer use if we send the customer
an email? Predictive modeling first and foremost is a process, consisting of
defining the problem, preparing the data, estimating the model, evaluating
the model, and selecting customers to target. We discuss the process in depth,
and conclude with a review of some important long-term considerations
related to predictive modeling.
</p>
<p>10.1 Predictive Modelling and the Quest
for Marketing Productivity
</p>
<p>Predictive modeling is the database marketer&rsquo;s primary tool for making mar-
keting efforts more productive. Predictive modeling allows the firm to focus
its marketing efforts on the customers for whom those efforts will be most
effective.
</p>
<p>Table 10.1 illustrates economic benefits of predictive modeling for a direct
marketer. The company has a list of 1,000,000 potential customers purchased
from a list vendor, and is planning to mail an offer for a compact DVD
player. If the customer decides to purchase and responds to the offer, the
profit contribution is $80. The cost of the mailing is $0.70 per mailed-to
customer. Although this would not be known in advance, assume that a
mailing to the entire list will generate 10,000 responses, a 1% response rate. If
the company mails to the entire list, profit contribution is 1,000,000 &times; 0.01 &times;
$80 = $800,000, and costs are 1,000,000 &times; $0.70 = $700,000. The net profit
is $800,000 &minus; $700,000 = $100,000, an ROI of $100,000/$700,000 = 14.3%.

<p>10 100,000 0.05 &minus;66, 000 100,000
&rArr; Profit = $334,000 by targeting top five deciles
</p>
<p>The bottom portion of Table 10.1 shows how predictive modeling im-
proves things considerably. Predictive modeling prioritizes the 1,000,000
prospects according to their likelihood of responding. We can then parti-
tion the prospects into 10 deciles ordered by likelihood of response. Those
in the top decile have a 3.00% chance of responding; those in the bottom
have only a 0.05% chance. The profit from mailing to the top decile is
100, 000&times; 0.03&times; $80&minus; 100, 000&times; $0.70 = $170, 000. The top five deciles gen-
erate positive profit if mailed, whereas the bottom five deciles generate a loss.
The decision is simple &ndash; mail to prospects in the top five deciles. The expected
profit is $334,000 despite an investment of only 500, 000&times; $0.70 = $350, 000.
For only half the investment compared to a mass mailing, the predictive
modeling approach yields more than three times the profit, for an ROI of
$334, 000/$350, 000 = 95.4%!
</p>
<p>The key assumption is that the direct marketer is able to segment cus-
tomers into deciles prioritized by likelihood of response. This is the job of
predictive modeling.
</p>
<p>The predictive model will be more successful to the extent that it can
better separate responders from the non-responders. Table 10.2 shows that
&ldquo;small&rdquo; improvements in this segmentation can have a dramatic impact on
profits.
</p>
<p>Table 10.2 shows three scenarios. Scenario 1 is the present situation, taken
from Table 10.1. In Scenario 2, the predictive model is able to identify a</p>

<p>248 10 The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>top decile that has a 3.5% response rate rather than a 3.00% response rate.
The second and third deciles are also a little better (2.20% vs. 2.00% and
1.50% vs. 1.40%), while the lower deciles have lower response rates so that
the average still comes to 1.00%, maintaining the assumption that 1.00% of
the 1,000,000 prospects will respond. This slight increase in predictive ability
means that if the direct marketer were to mail to the top five deciles, profits
would be $370,000 rather than $334,000. Profits are maximized by mailing to
the top four deciles, yielding $376,000 in profits. This is an increase of $42,000
and now ROI is $376, 000/(400, 000 &times; $0.70) = 134%. Scenario 3 continues
this process, except now response rate in the top decile is 4.00% rather than
3.00%, etc. Optimal profits in this scenario are now $430,000, for an ROI of
$430, 000/(300, 000&times; $0.70) = 205%.
</p>
<p>In short, predictive modeling allows dramatic increases in profits relative
to mass mailing, and every &ldquo;ounce&rdquo; of additional predictive ability increases
profits still further. An improvement from 3.0% response to 3.5% response
doesn&rsquo;t seem that large. But multiplied through by the 100,000 customers in
decile 1, and then by the $80 contribution, increases profit by 0.50 &times; $80 &times;
100, 000 = $40, 000.
</p>
<p>Because of the above economics, predictive modeling has become a very
competitive industry. While the basic process is straightforward, there are
many subtleties and nuances. There is a continual race for the &ldquo;latest and
greatest&rdquo; twist that produces a 3.5% top-decile response rather than 3.0%.
Many of these details are described in Chapters 8 and 11 through 19, which
cover the statistical methods and data sources that underlie the process. The
purpose of this chapter is to focus on the process, to show how the methods
and data combine to create the &ldquo;lift table&rdquo; shown in Table 10.1.
</p>
<p>10.2 The Predictive Modeling Process: Overview
</p>
<p>Figure 10.1 presents the predictive modeling process. It consists of four main
steps &ndash; (1) Define the Problem, (2) Prepare the Data, (3) Estimate the Model,
and (4) Select Customers to Target. Each of these consists of important sub-
steps. Academic research often focuses on one sub-step at a time, e.g., com-
paring neural nets to logistic regression as a statistical model. However, as
emphasized by Neslin et al. (2006a), all the steps are important in combina-
tion, and together constitute an approach to predictive modeling.
</p>
<p>10.3 The Process in Detail

taking their business elsewhere (&ldquo;churning&rdquo;), decide which financial products
to cross-sell to which customers, decide which customers should receive a new
company-sponsored magazine, or decide which customers should be offered
a free needs assessment by a financial advisor.
</p>
<p>The Internet has generated many applications of predictive modeling, in-
cluding: which customers should be serviced on the Internet versus a company</p>

<p>representative, which products should be recommended to the customer as
he or she navigates through the company website, which online ads should be
&ldquo;served&rdquo; to which customers on which pages (Manchanda et al. 2006), which
customers should receive which promotions as they purchase from an e-tailer
website (Zhang and Krishnamurthi 2004), and which customers should re-
ceive e-mails with particular messages (Ansari and Mela 2003). Even as the
Internet enters its mature stage as a marketing channel, answers to these
questions are still not part of normal business routine.
</p>
<p>10.3.2 Prepare the Data
</p>
<p>Data preparation is perhaps the least exciting phase of the predictive model-
ing process, but it is the foundation upon which rests the success of the entire
process. It involves a variety of tasks, ranging from conceptual to clerical.
</p>
<p>10.3.2.1 Define the Behavior to Be Predicted
and the Potential Predictors
</p>
<p>The behavior to be predicted (the &ldquo;dependent variable&rdquo;) follows directly
from the definition of the problem. For example, if the problem is to identify
would-be churners, the behavior to be predicted is customer churn.
</p>
<p>The main categories of potential predictor variables include (see Chap-
ter 8):
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer characteristics &ndash; demographics, lifestyle, psychographics, gener-
ally, variables that describe the customer and remain relatively constant
over time.
</p>
<p>&bull; Previous behavior &ndash; previous purchases, previous product usage, and re-
sponse to previous marketing efforts. Behavior is often described using
&ldquo;RFM&rdquo; variables (recency, frequency, and monetary value), i.e., how re-
cently did the customer purchase, how frequently has the customer pur-
chased over the last x years, and what is the average expenditure when
the customer makes a purchase.
</p>
<p>&bull; Previous marketing &ndash; previous marketing efforts targeted at the customer,
including catalogs, e-mails, telemarketing, sales force visits, etc.
</p>
<p>Table 10.3 depicts examples of managerial problems, the behavior of interest,
and potential predictors. For example, in deciding which prospects to target
for a customer acquisition campaign, the company may have conducted a
test mailing. Response to that test is the behavior to be predicted. Potential
predictors would be customer characteristics included in the prospect list,
e.g., the customer&rsquo;s &ldquo;FICO&rdquo; score (a measure of financial risk developed by
Fair Isaac, Inc. (Myers Internet, Inc. 2005).</p>

</p>
<p>Sometimes the choices are not straightforward. For example, if the com-
pany has a particular product in mind for a cross-selling campaign, it can
conduct a test and use response to the offer for this product as the depen-
dent variable. However, the company might have several potential products
to cross-sell and can&rsquo;t test each one. One possibility is to define the behavior
to be predicted as the product most recently purchased. Important predictors
would include the products the customer had bought previously to the most
recent product (see Chapter 21, Knott et al. 2002).
</p>
<p>Paradoxically, previous marketing efforts, and response to those efforts, of-
ten are the most difficult data to compile. This is partly due to poor record-
keeping. For example, during the dot-com boom, companies e-mailed cus-
tomers frantically without noting which customers received what. In contrast,
previous purchase data are readily available because purchases are recorded
by accounts receivable.
</p>
<p>One category of data usually not used is competitive activity &ndash; marketing
efforts received or competitive products purchased by current customers. This
is due to the difficulty in collecting such data, and is endemic to database
marketing.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>252 10 The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>10.3.2.2 Compile the Data
</p>
<p>The behavior and predictors listed in the previous step must be quantified
and assembled into a data file that can be accessed by statistical software.
The data may be available from several sources:
</p>
<p>&bull; The &ldquo;house file&rdquo; &ndash; For example, for the next-product-to-buy application,
the company should know from its current customer records the product
most recently purchased and the products that were purchased before that
one.
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchased data &ndash; For example, a financial services company may need a
measure of financial risk such as a FICO score. It can purchase a list of
individuals with their FICO scores, and merge it with its house file. This
can also be done with variables such as product ownership, media usage,
etc. The process is to find a list that has the desired variable and merge
that with the house list. The parties that help do this are list brokers (who
can find lists), list managers (who sell the lists), and service bureaus that
merge purchased lists and house lists.
</p>
<p>&bull; Test data &ndash; Very often, a test provides the key source of data, especially
the dependent variable. For example, a telecom company might test a
churn management program on a group of 20,000 high-potential churners
and observe which ones are &ldquo;rescued&rdquo; by the program. This provides the
dependent variable &ndash; &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; &ndash; for a predictive model.
</p>
<p>&bull; Surveys &ndash; Surveys are useful for obtaining measures on two variables often
missing from house data and difficult to purchase from a third party &ndash;
consumer attitudes and competitive activity. The problem is that for a
company with a million or so customers, it is impractical to survey all
of them. However, one procedure is to survey a subset of customers and
leverage the results to infer the attitudes of the rest of its customers, or
infer the competitive activity of its customers (see Du et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>&bull; Text Data &ndash; The vast majority of data used for predictive modeling are
metric &ndash; RFM, customer demographics, etc. However, text data such as
the content of customer e-mails may be an important future source of
data. See Coussement and Van den Poel (2007a) for a recent application
to predicting customer churn.
</p>
<p>Figure 10.2 illustrates schematically how predictive models can be used to
leverage survey data on a subset of customers to infer data for the rest of
the customer base (see also Chapter 16). The example is of a company using
cluster analysis of survey responses to define market segments, estimating a
predictive model to predict membership in those segments, and then apply-
ing that predictive model on its (non-surveyed) customers to predict their
membership in the desired cluster.
</p>
<p>The first step is to survey say 500 customers on their &ldquo;attribute impor-
tances&rdquo; (e.g., the importance of quality, reliability, durability, price, conve-
nience). These data are then cluster analyzed to define market segments (in</p>

</p>
<p>this case, Quality Seeker and Price Seeker segments). Then a predictive model
is estimated to predict which customers in the survey are members of the de-
sired segment. The predictors are customer characteristics and RFM variables
collected from the survey respondents, but also available in the house data
file.1 The predictive model can then be applied to the full customer database
to identify customers predicted to be in the desired cluster.
</p>
<p>This procedure provides the potential to incorporate richer variables into
a predictive modeling application. The spirit of the approach is similar to all
predictive modeling, where a model estimated on a subset of customers is ap-
plied to the entire customer data file. However, the sample size for estimating
the model is typically much lower (e.g., 500 rather than thousands) and the
richness of the data being analyzed may make them more difficult to predict.
Hence, companies should be cautious, using controlled tests before rolling out
a full campaign based on this approach.
</p>
<p>10.3.2.3 Pre-Process the Data
</p>
<p>Once the data have been assembled in a data file, there is the often painstak-
ing job of &ldquo;pre-processing&rdquo; the data. There are three main tasks &ndash; creating
dummy variables, handling missing data, and creating composite variables.
</p>
<p>Nominally scaled variables such as gender, country of residence, source of
acquisition, etc., must be re-scaled as dummy variables. Some computer pro-
grams, e.g., ModelMax, distributed by ASA, Inc. (http://www.asacorp.com/
index.jsp) do this automatically. SAS, SPSS, and Excel, can also be used to
create dummy variables.
</p>
<p>Composite variables are created by combining two or more of the original
variables. For example, RFM variables are typically created from original
variables. For example, recency is created by finding the date of the most
recent purchase and calculating the time from that purchase to the time
</p>
<p>1 We assume the survey is anonymous so the customer characteristics and RFM variables
have to be asked directly. If the survey were not anonymous, the firm could simply link
the customer to the customer characteristics and RFM variables available in its house
file, and just use the survey to collect the attitudinal data.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>254 10 The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>period when the dependent variable is observed; frequency is created by
counting the number of purchases over a given period or since the acquisition
of the customer; monetary value can be calculated as the average expenditure
across all purchases ever made by the customer. RFM can be defined on
marketing as well as purchase data. For example, RFM measures of outgoing
customer contacts would include: when did the customer last receive a
catalog (recency), how many catalogs did the customer receive over the last
year (frequency), and what was the average size of the catalog received by
a customer (monetary value).
</p>
<p>Another composite variable is trend. For example, a telecom company
may have data on the number of calls made each month over an 8-month
period. The analyst may calculate a trend to indicate whether the number of
calls is increasing or decreasing. This could be the compounded growth rate
(geometric mean) over the 8-month period, or the trend coefficient from a
regression of number of calls versus time.
</p>
<p>Composite variables can quantify &ldquo;massively categorical variables&rdquo; such
as zip code or state (Steenburgh et al. 2003). For example, there are 50
states in the USA. One can create 50 dummy variables to represent each
state. But probably several states contribute equally to the dependent vari-
able, so those states should be combined into one composite dummy vari-
able (e.g., if State = CA, NH, ME, FA, or MA, then COMSTATE = 1;
else COMSTATE = 0). The question is which states should be combined.
There are algorithms for figuring this out, usually combining heuristics and
statistical tests. States might be ordered in terms of response rates, and var-
ious breakpoints considered for grouping the states together. For each set
of breakpoints, a statistical test can be used to decide whether the states
grouped together by the breakpoints have equal response rates. These algo-
rithms are employed by decision tree software (see Chapter 17) but are also
available in software geared toward other statistical procedures (e.g., see the
ModelMax program mentioned earlier, that &ldquo;bins&rdquo; variables such as state of
residence into homogenous composite groups).
</p>
<p>Another approach is due to Steenburgh et al. (2003). These authors create
a hierarchical Bayes model for zip codes of the form:
</p>
<p>Yi =
J&sum;
</p>
<p>j=1
</p>
<p>αjXij + βzi + εi (10.1)
</p>
<p>βz =
K&sum;
</p>
<p>k=1
</p>
<p>γkWkz + νz (10.2)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>Yi = Value of the dependent variable (e.g., lifetime value) for customer i.
Xij = Value of predictor variable j for customer i.
αj = Parameter reflecting the importance of predictor variable j in predicting
</p>
<p>behavior.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.3 The Process in Detail 255
</p>
<p>βz = Contribution of zip code z to predicting behavior.2
</p>
<p>Wkz = Value of variable k associated with zip code z. For example, these
variables might be the average income of all persons residing in zip code
z, their average age, education, or the average home value of homes in zip
code z.
</p>
<p>γk = Importance of Wkz in determining the contribution of zip code z to
predicting behavior. For example, a high value of γk for k = income would
mean that zip codes with high income tend to have higher values of the
dependent variable.
</p>
<p>εi = Unobserved factors for customer i that influence this customer&rsquo;s behav-
ior.
</p>
<p>νz = Unobserved factors for zip code z that influence this zip code&rsquo;s contri-
bution to customer behavior.
</p>
<p>Rather than 10,000 zip code dummies, the idea is to model the contribution of
zip code to behavior as a function of observed characteristics of the zip code.
The authors estimate this model using Bayesian techniques, and show that it
outperforms a more straightforward model that includes the characteristics of
the zip code directly in the model. The authors find that if a lot of information
is available for each zip code, the difference between the approaches is not as
large.
</p>
<p>The final phase of pre-processing the data is handling missing values. As
described in Chapter 11, this can be done by eliminating customers with miss-
ing data (this is usually too wasteful), creating missing variable dummies, or
imputing a value for the missing value. The simplest approach is to insert the
mean for each missing variable, but this procedure can be highly inaccurate
if the missing variable is highly correlated with other variables. For example,
if income is highly correlated with education and income is missing, it would
distort the results to impute the same income for both a highly educated and
not highly educated customer. For that reason, missing variable dummies or
more sophisticated methods of imputation, as described in Chapter 11, are
preferred.
</p>
<p>10.3.2.4 Create Calibration and Validation Samples
</p>
<p>As described in Chapter 11, it is a good idea to estimate the predictive model
on a &ldquo;calibration&rdquo; dataset, and test it on a &ldquo;validation&rdquo; dataset. This pre-
vents model &ldquo;over-fitting,&rdquo; i.e., finding statistical parameters that predict
idiosyncratic characteristics of the calibration data that do not hold up in
the real world.
</p>
<p>The question arises as to what should be the sample size and percent-
age allocation of data to calibration versus validation. Usually, in database
</p>
<p>2 z is not indexed by i in Equation 10.2 because Equation 10.2 models the average con-
tribution of zip code z to predicting behavior. In Equation 10.1, we would use the β for
zi, the zip code where customer i resides, to predict that individual&rsquo;s behavior.</p>

<p>256 10 The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>marketing applications the sample sizes vary from 10,000 to 100,000s. Note
this is the case even if all variables are observed for all millions of customers.
The reason is that to estimate a model on say a million customers can use
a lot of computer time, and sample sizes in the tens of thousands often are
sufficient. If the sample size is relatively small (e.g., 10,000), intuitively the
majority of the data should be allocated to the calibration data. In this case,
Chapter 11 discusses a 2/3, 1/3 allocation to calibration and validation.
</p>
<p>10.3.3 Estimate the Model
</p>
<p>10.3.3.1 Select Predictors
</p>
<p>In Chapter 11, we discuss various methods for selecting variables for inclusion
in predictive models. These include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Theory : For example, customer satisfaction should predict customer churn.
&bull; Managerial Relevance: For example, evaluating the call center may be on
</p>
<p>management&rsquo;s agenda, so including &ldquo;number of calls to call center&rdquo; may
be an important variable to include in a churn model.
</p>
<p>&bull; Stepwise Regression: This method selects the subset of the variables that
maximizes adjusted R2. Adjusted R2 penalizes the model if it uses too
many variables to achieve a good level of fit. Stepwise procedures exclude
variables that are correlated with the dependent variable, but also corre-
lated with other predictors that are even more highly correlated with the
dependent variable, and excludes variables that simply have low correla-
tion with the dependent variable.
</p>
<p>&bull; All-possible Subsets Regression: This examines all models that can esti-
mated given the set of predictors, and chooses the best one. This is an
appealing idea but becomes impractical when there are even a moderate
number of predictors.
</p>
<p>&bull; Factor Analysis: This groups together predictors that are highly correlated
with each other to create a composite variable as a weighted sum of those
variables.
</p>
<p>&bull; Decision Trees: Decision trees select variables that best separate respon-
ders from non-responders, among the customers left after previous sub-
divisions of the data.
</p>
<p>There are no definitive studies on the best way to select variables for a predic-
tive model. Data collected as part of a &ldquo;churn modeling tournament&rdquo; (Neslin
et al. 2006a) provide some evidence for how commonly used various methods
are, shown in Fig. 10.3. The churn modeling tournament invited academics
and practitioners to predict customer churn using a database made available
by the authors. There were 44 entries, divided roughly 50&ndash;50 between aca-
demics and practitioners. As shown in Fig. 10.3, the most commonly used</p>

<p>10.3 The Process in Detail 257
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.3 Methods used to select variables for churn modeling tournament (Statistics
provided by Neslin et al. 2006a).
</p>
<p>methods for selecting variables were (1) exploratory data analysis (e.g., cal-
culating correlations and examining the data), (2) &ldquo;common sense,&rdquo; and (3)
stepwise. Entrants also used, to a lesser degree, &ldquo;theory,&rdquo; factor analysis, and
cluster analysis. When confronted with a real problem, analysts apparently
use relatively &ldquo;low brow&rdquo; methods to select variables, and among statistical
techniques, stepwise regression dominates.
</p>
<p>Another finding from the tournament is the number of variables included
in the model. Figure 10.4 shows this distribution. There were approximately
75 predictors in the data provided. Participants could also create dummy
variables and composite variables. Figure 10.4 shows that the clear majority
of modelers included 40 or fewer variables, although a few included 100+.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>258 10 The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>These entrants used decision tree approaches that create several decision
trees, each with a different set of variables. Therefore, the &ldquo;norm&rdquo; for a real-
world application in this case was about 20&ndash;40.
</p>
<p>10.3.3.2 Select the Statistical Modeling Technique
</p>
<p>Statistical techniques that can be used for predictive models include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Regression
&bull; Logistic regression (Chapter 15)
&bull; Type I or Type II Tobit (Chapter 15)
&bull; Decision trees (Chapter 17)
&bull; Neural nets (Chapter 18)
&bull; Machine learning algorithms (Chapter 19)
</p>
<p>No one method is considered best in terms of predictive accuracy. Machine
learning algorithms appear very promising, but they have not been applied
often enough or compared enough to more traditional methods to make a
definitive statement. It is noteworthy that the winning entry to the churn
modeling tournament was a bagging and boosting decision tree algorithm, a
machine learning method.
</p>
<p>An important criterion in selecting a statistical model, besides predictive
accuracy, is ease of interpretation, i.e., understanding and communicating
what drives the behavior being modeled. Decision trees are especially strong
here, and to a lesser degree logistic or regular regression. For example, the
branches of a decision tree can easily be communicated to customer care cen-
ter personnel so they can act accordingly (e.g., &ldquo;if the customer is a heavy
user, been a customer for at least 5 years, and has called before, route the cus-
tomer to the . . . department&rdquo;). Neural nets and machine learning algorithms
are generally weaker on this criterion. Neural nets supposedly gain predic-
tive accuracy because they are highly nonlinear and can capture interactions.
However, to the authors&rsquo; knowledge, most neural net programs do not clearly
show these effects.
</p>
<p>Another important issue is the nature of the dependent variable. If the
dependent variable is continuous, regular regression is easy to use, whereas
logistic regression is designed for the case of a 0&ndash;1 dependent variable (e.g.,
respond versus not respond). Multinomial logit can be used if the dependent
variable is nominally scaled but contains several categories. Decision trees,
neural nets, and machine learning algorithms can be used for both continu-
ous and 0&ndash;1 dependent variables. Type I Tobits are designed for continuous
variables that have a lower limit, such as customer expenditures, which are
bounded below by zero. Type II Tobits are applicable when modeling a 0&ndash;1
and a continuous variable, such as whether the customer will respond, and
if so, how much he or she will spend. Research is needed to compare Type II
Tobits with using a regression model for expenditures, a logistic regression
for response, and multiplying the results.</p>

<p>10.3 The Process in Detail 259
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.5 Statistical models used for the churn modeling tournament (Statistics provided
by Neslin et al. 2006a).
</p>
<p>Figure 10.5 shows the methods that were used for the churn modeling tour-
nament. Logistic regression was the most popular method, followed by deci-
sion trees and neural nets. Logistic regression is readily available on standard
software, including SPSS and SAS. Decision trees require specialized soft-
ware such as SPSS&rsquo;s AnswerTree. ASA&rsquo;s ModelMax (Sect. 10.3.2.3) is one
alternative for developing neural nets.
</p>
<p>10.3.3.3 Estimate the Model
</p>
<p>As noted in Sect. 10.3.2.4, it is common to subdivide the data into calibra-
tion (estimation) and validation (holdout) samples. Sometimes a model is
estimated on the calibration data, tested on the validation, and then re-
estimated and re-tested as necessary, eventually arriving at the final model.
Note this iterative process is not a validation test. In a validation test, the fi-
nal model is used to predict for the validation sample. In the churn modeling
tournament (Neslin et al. 2006a), more than three quarters of the submis-
sions subdivided the data as part of estimation. In fact, neural net algorithms
often use this tactic in employing &ldquo;training&rdquo; and &ldquo;test&rdquo; samples.

</p>
<p>company conducts a test on 10,000 customers and observes the responses
shown in Table 10.4. It has measures of recency, frequency, and monetary
value to use as predictors. For example, customer 1 bought last month and
so has a recency of 0, bought 5 times over the last year and therefore has a
frequency of 5, and the customer&rsquo;s average expenditure per purchase is $242.
It turns out that the customer responded to the catalog and made a purchase.
The responses were generating by simulating the following logistic regression
model:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.3 The Process in Detail 261
</p>
<p>Probability(Respond) =
1
</p>
<p>1 + e&minus;(&minus;7.5&minus;0.15R+0.1F+0.03M)
(10.3)
</p>
<p>Response is negatively related to recency, and positively related to frequency
and monetary value. It turns out, simulating this model, that 26.1% of all
10,000 customers responded to the catalog.
</p>
<p>Using all 10,000 observations yields the following logistic regression:
</p>
<p>Probability(Respond) =
1
</p>
<p>1 + e&minus;(&minus;7.739&minus;0.118R+0.092F+0.031M)
(10.4)
</p>
<p>Note this model is close to the true model, in Equation 10.3. The next step
simply is to substitute each customer&rsquo;s values for R, F , and M into Equa-
tion 10.4 and calculate the predicted probability of response, yielding Ta-
ble 10.5. We see that we predict a probability of 0.554 that customer 1 re-
sponds to the catalog.
</p>
<p>Next we order the customers by predicted likelihood of response as shown
in Table 10.6. Customer 7,672, with R = 2, F = 11, and M = $290, has the
highest predicted probability of response, 0.884. The top 25-ranked customers
have high predicted response probabilities, and indeed, most of them re-
sponded. The bottom customers (#s 9,990&ndash;10,000) have low predicted prob-
ability of response, and none of them responded.
</p>
<p>Now we are in a position to divide the data into n-tiles, in this case, deciles.
The top decile includes customers ranked 1 through 1,000. Table 10.7 shows
that the 1,000th customer has a predicted response probability 0.4588.3 We
would classify any new customer with a predicted probability between 0.4588
and 1 to be in the top decile. Note also that 54.2% of the customers in the
top decile actually did purchase.
</p>
<p>We can repeat this process for the 2nd, 3rd, etc. deciles. This produces the
lift table shown in Table 10.8.4 We can use Table 10.8 to calculate profit per
decile as in Table 10.1. The model would then be applied to the company&rsquo;s
1,000,000 other customers. Each would be classified in the appropriate decile
using the cut-offs in Table 10.8, and then mailed to if they were in a profitable
decile. Note we would use the actual response rate, not the predicted response
rate, in the profit calculations. In practice, there should not be too much
difference between the two.5
</p>
<p>Since we can view the 1,000 customers in each decile as a sample from
all the company&rsquo;s customers, the actual response rate is a sample pro-
portion. A 95% confidence interval therefore for the response rate for the
</p>
<p>3 We are assuming that there are no ties in predicted response probability, so we can iso-
late the single customer who is ranked 1,000th. Sometimes, especially with models with
large samples but only a few predictor variables, it is possible to have ties in predicted
response. In that case there could be an uneven number of customers in each n-tile.
</p>
<p>4 We describe the &ldquo;lift&rdquo; column of Table 10.8 in the next section.
5 However, it is possible that the predicted response rate suffers from &ldquo;rare event&rdquo; bias
(see Sect. 10.3.5.1 and Chapter 15, Sect. 15.1.3). Using the actual response rate is one
way to avoid this problem.</p>

</p>
<p>In words, λk is how much more likely customers in n-tile k are to respond
compared to the response rate for the entire sample. We want lift in the
top tiles to be greater than 1, and lift in the lower tiles to be less than
1. Consider Table 10.9. The response rate across the entire sample &ndash; the
&ldquo;average&rdquo; &ndash; is 1.60%. The response rate in the top decile is 6.00%. Therefore,</p>

</p>
<p>customers in the top decile are 3.75 times more likely to respond than average
(λ1 = 6.00/1.60 = 3.75). Top decile lift is 3.75 to 1.
</p>
<p>Lift itself does not have direct managerial significance. What matters is
the economics of profit, which are built off response rate, profit contribu-
tion, and cost, as in Table 10.1. However, higher lift makes a particular n-tile
more profitable, since lift is directly proportional to response rate. Also, lift
provides a common measure that can be used to compare models across ap-
plications and circumstances. For example, our experience is that top-decile
lift typically is lies between 1.5 and 10.0, with 3&ndash;5 probably the norm.
</p>
<p>There is a maximum achievable top-n-tile lift. Let r̄ be the response rate
across the entire sample; N is the sample size and n is the number of tiles.
Then:

<p>Max Lift =
</p>
<p>{
n if N &times; r̄ &le; N/n
1/r̄ if N &times; r̄ &gt; N/n (10.7)
</p>
<p>The key is to account for whether there is a large enough sample in the
top decile to accommodate all responders. Consider first the case that the
number of responders (N &times; r̄) is less than the number of customers in the

<p>top tile (N/n).6 Then the maximum response rate in that decile would be
N&times;r̄
N/n = nr̄ and maximum lift would be nr̄/r̄ = n. Assuming this case holds
for Table 10.9, the maximum top-decile lift is 10, so having achieved 3.75, we
are about 37.5% of where we would be with a perfect model. If there are more
responders than customers in the top tile, at best we can have all of customers
in the top decile classified as responders, so top decile lift would be 1/r̄.
</p>
<p>In Table 10.8, r̄ = 0.261, n = 10 andN = 10, 000, soN&times;r̄ = 2, 610 &gt; 1, 000
and maximum top decile lift is 1/r̄ = 1/0.261 = 3.83. Our top-decile lift of
2.08 means we have achieved 54.3% of what would be achieved with a perfect
model.
</p>
<p>10.3.4.3 Additional Ways of Evaluating the Model
</p>
<p>Chapter 11 details other statistics for evaluating predictive models. One of
the most common is the &ldquo;cumulative lift chart,&rdquo; which tabulates cumulative
response rates from the top n-tile down. Continuing the example in Table 10.9,
Table 10.10 shows the calculation of cumulative lift.
</p>
<p>The cumulative lift for the kth decile shows the percentage of all respon-
ders accounted for by the first k deciles. Table 10.10 says that the top 3 deciles
account for 75.0% of all responders. Obviously, the higher the cumulative lift
for a given decile, the better. Cumulative lift can be calculated by cumu-
latively summing the total number of responders in successive deciles, and
dividing by the total number of respondents.7
</p>
<p>As discussed in Chapter 11, another evaluation technique is to see how
well the model predicts on a validation database. Assume 20,000, not 10,000
</p>
<p>6 We assume there are no ties in the top n-tile, so the exact number of customers in the
top n-tile is N/n. See Footnote 3.
</p>
<p>7 One could also calculate lift by cumulating the lift column and dividing by the sum
of all n lifts. However, that may not be exact if there are slightly different numbers of
customers in each n-tile, due to ties. See Footnote 3. In Table 10.10, we are assuming
this is not a problem.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.3 The Process in Detail 267
</p>
<p>customers, had been in the test, but the estimated predictive model (Equa-
tion 10.4) was based on the 10,000 calibration customers. That equation, and
the corresponding cut-offs shown in Table 10.8, could be used to classify the
validation customers, then we could calculate the actual percentage response
rate among these customers. This rate should not differ appreciably from
the actual response rates in Table 10.8. Another commonly used method of
evaluation is to pit one model versus another, say the logistic regression model
versus a neural net model, and compare them in terms of lift, cumulative
lift, etc.
</p>
<p>10.3.5 Select Customers to Target
</p>
<p>There are four approaches to deciding which customers to target:
</p>
<p>&bull; Lift (gains) table cut-off (e.g., see Banslaben 1992)
&bull; Individual score cut-off (e.g., see Bult and Wansbeek 1995)
&bull; Budget constraint
&bull; Choice-based segmentation (Gensch 1984; Gensch et al. 1990)
</p>
<p>10.3.5.1 Lift (Gains) Table Cut-Off
</p>
<p>There are four steps to using the lift table to decide which customers to target
(see also Banslaben 1992):
</p>
<p>&bull; Finalize the lift table
&bull; Score the rest of the data
&bull; Place these customers into the appropriate n-tile
&bull; Select n-tiles to target
</p>
<p>Finalize the Lift Table
</p>
<p>There are two issues here: (1) How many tiles to use? (2) Whether to use
predicted response rates directly from the model, or the actual response rates
for each decile? The number of tiles to use depends somewhat on the sample
size. From Equation 10.5, the plus or minus around the predicted response
rates for an n-tile depends on the sample size, which is N/n, where N is
the total sample size and n is the number of tiles. This would favor fewer
tiles. However, more tiles are beneficial if say the top decile is divided into a
very high-responding group versus a less high-responding group. The trade-
off is between added detail in looking at more tiles, and the smaller sample
size available to quantify that detail. Our experience is that deciles are often
used to evaluate models simply because deciles are a common benchmark.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>268 10 The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>However, more tiles, even centiles, are might be used to select the actual
customers to target.
</p>
<p>While it would be most logical to use the response probabilities calculated
directly from the model to select customers, there are two arguments against
this. First, nonlinear models such as logistic regression can under-estimate
true response probabilities when response is relatively &ldquo;rare.&rdquo; Chapter 15
discusses this as well as potential statistical corrections. But the simplest
approach is to use the actual response rates in each n-tile as the prediction
of response. Second, the calibration sample may intentionally be constructed
to contain 50% responders and 50% non-responders. This is to provide more
instances of response and hence the model can learn better how to profile
responders. The result is that the predicted response rate certainly cannot
be taken literally. However, the model could be used to rank a validation
sample that reflects the true response rate for the population. Then we can
group customers into deciles, observe the actual response rates, and use them
as the predicted response probabilities.
</p>
<p>Score the Rest of the Data
</p>
<p>Most predictive models are estimated on a subset of all customers but deci-
sions must be made for all customers. For example, in the example above, a
test is conducted on 10,000 customers, the lift table is set up using this sam-
ple, and then predictions are made for the rest of the company&rsquo;s customers.
This is referred to as &ldquo;scoring&rdquo; the database.
</p>
<p>Place Customers into the Appropriate n-Tile
</p>
<p>Once each customer is scored, he or she can be classified into the appropriate
n-tile using the cut-offs shown for example in Table 10.8. This classification
can be used to select customers for the immediate application at hand, or
stored for use in future applications. For example, management might decide
to take a particular action on customers who scored in the top decile for at
least one of three catalog response models.
</p>
<p>Select n-Tiles to Target
</p>
<p>Once we have classified all customers in the appropriate tile, and decided what
we will use for predicted response, customer selection is simple. We simply
calculate the profit from each tile as in Table 10.1 and target customers who
are in the profitable tiles. We saw in Table 10.1 how this targeting can vastly
increase both profits and ROI compared to mass marketing. This is the heart
of what database marketing is about.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.3 The Process in Detail 269
</p>
<p>10.3.5.2 Individual Score Cut-Off
</p>
<p>Another approach to selecting customers to target is to use the predictive
model to predict response for each customer, and select a cut-off point for
these predictions so that all customers scoring above this point are targeted.
The simplest way to implement this is first to calculate the breakeven re-
sponse rate needed for the marketing effort to be profitable, and then select
all customers whose predicted response likelihood is above that point. For
example, if r is the response probability, w is the profit contribution per re-
sponse, and c is the cost of contacting a customer, it is profitable to contact
the customer as long as rw &minus; c &gt; 0, or r &gt; c/w. So, the firm would target
any customer whose predicted response rate is higher than the cut-off point
c/w.
</p>
<p>Bult and Wansbeek (1995) derive an optimal cut-off point so that the
expected marginal contribution of mailing to customers above that point
equals the marginal cost. Let customer i&rsquo;s score from a predictive model be
ni. Using a logistic predictive model and assuming a logistic distribution of
the ni&rsquo;s across customers, they obtain the following expression for the optimal
fraction of customers to select:
</p>
<p>qopt =
1
</p>
<p>1 + eαγ(w &minus; 1)&minus;γ (10.8)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>qopt = Optimal fraction of customers to select for the direct marketing cam-
paign.
</p>
<p>γ = Parameter for the logistic distribution of the ni&rsquo;s; higher γ means the
ni&rsquo;s are more concentrated, i.e., lower variance in predicted scores across
customers.
</p>
<p>α = Constant term in the logistic regression model.
w = Marginal contribution of a response, relative to the marginal cost. So,
</p>
<p>w &gt; 1 means that the marginal response contributes more than the cost.
</p>
<p>Equation 10.8 shows if the marginal contribution is higher, we can target more
customers. If the constant in the logistic regression model is more positive,
this means that the level of response is generally lower, and we will not want
to target as many customers. The relation between γ and the optimal fraction
to target is not monotonic (see Table 3 of Bult and Wansbeek).
</p>
<p>Bult and Wansbeek compare their approach to the lift table approach
using deciles and a linear probability model. They find their approach yields
8% higher profits. This happens for at least two reasons: (1) The authors use
a logistic regression rather than a linear probability model, and the logistic
regression could have been more accurate. (2) Separating into deciles was too
coarse a segmentation for this application. The decile approach yielded 40%
as the fraction to be mailed, whereas the proposed approach yielded 47% as
the fraction to be mailed.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>270 10 The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>Bult and Wansbeek&rsquo;s approach is very promising. First, it realizes that
dividing the population into tiles is only an approximation of the response
rate as a function of the fraction invited. Second, it takes into account the
uncertainty in predicting individual response rates, through its explicit ac-
counting for the error term in the predictive model. However, the method
makes assumptions not only with regard to the form of the predictive model
(all predictive modelers do this) but also with respect to the distribution
of predicted scores in the population. Future work is needed to make more
detailed comparisons among (1) the Bult and Wansbeek method, (2) the lift-
table cut-off method, and (3) the simple cut-off point method described at
the beginning of this section.
</p>
<p>10.3.5.3 Budget Constrained Cut-Off
</p>
<p>Another approach to determining whom to target is to derive a budget-
constrained cut-off. This is easy to do. If the contact cost per customer is
c, and the budget is B, then the firm should contact the top B/c customers
ranked by a predictive model. Companies may use this approach if they have
decided on a marketing plan that specifies a total budget for direct marketing
activities. Perhaps part of the plan is to spend $1 M on five direct marketing
efforts, so the budget for each is $200,000.
</p>
<p>An advantage of the budget approach is that it does not require the level
of the prediction to be correct, just the ordering of the customers. This makes
good sense. A predictive model may be estimated at time t and applied at
time t + x, where x could be measured in months. During this time, com-
petitive conditions, seasonality, the rest of the product&rsquo;s marketing mix, etc.,
could change the absolute level of response. However, it is less likely that the
ordering of customers would change (unless there were interactions between
the variables in the predictive model and the changes in the environment).
</p>
<p>Of course the downside of the budget approach is that the budget may
prevent the company from mailing to customers who might be profitable, or
encourage the company to contact customers who will not respond profitably.
</p>
<p>10.3.5.4 How Deeply to Go Down the List: Trading
Off Mis-Targeting Errors
</p>
<p>As just mentioned, there are two errors that can be made in selecting cus-
tomers:
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Type I Error&rdquo; &ndash; Targeting a customer who really is not profitable.
&bull; &ldquo;Type II Error&rdquo; &ndash; Not targeting a customer who would have been prof-
</p>
<p>itable.
</p>
<p>Ideally a company would like the probability of both these errors small, but
decreasing one tends to increase the other. For example, to prevent Type I</p>

aType 1 Error: Targeting a customer who turns out not to be profitable (e.g., does not
respond).
Type II Error: Not targeting a customer who would have been profitable (e.g., would
have responded).
</p>
<p>Errors, the company would want to avoid contacting customers who are not
profitable. That would &ldquo;bias&rdquo; the company not to mail as far down the list.
As a result, the company would not contact several customers who would
have been profitable. That means increased likelihood of Type II Errors. The
same logic holds if we try to prevent Type II Errors. This would encourage
the company to contact more customers, since the worst thing would be
not to contact customers who were profitable. By giving the customers the
benefit of the doubt and contacting more of them, undoubtedly several will
be contacted who in fact are not profitable. This would increase the number
of Type I Errors.
</p>
<p>The root of these arguments is the classical statistics treatment of Type I
and Type II Errors. The company essentially is trying to decide between two
hypotheses &ndash; the customer is profitable versus the customer is not profitable.
We have oriented the argument so that the null hypothesis is that the
customer is not profitable. Under that definition, Type I Error is concluding
the alternative (Profitable) is true even though the null (Unprofitable) is
really true.
</p>
<p>One possibility would be to formalize these issues in a decision-making
framework by quantifying the costs of Type I and Type II Errors, as well
as the firm utility function for these errors. We indeed recommend this as
further research. We will instead focus on the strategic ramifications of Type
I and Type II Error thinking.
</p>
<p>A relevant question is under what circumstances a company would care
more about Type I versus Type II Errors, and hence contact less aggressively
or more aggressively, respectively. The following factors are important (see
Table 10.11):
</p>
<p>&bull; Objective: Type I Error companies tend to care about ROI. This encour-
ages them to make the denominator of ROI lower, i.e., not contacting as
many. Type II companies tend to care more about sales. For sure, the
steeper down the list one contacts, the more sales there will be.
</p>
<p>&bull; View of contact : Type I Error companies are concerned that contacts are
clutter from the customer perspective, and don&rsquo;t want to bother the cus-
tomer unless it&rsquo;s clear the contact will be profitable. Type II companies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>272 10 The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>view contacts as communication. Even if the customer doesn&rsquo;t respond,
his or her awareness of the company has improved, and this can pay off
later on.
</p>
<p>&bull; Campaign budget : Companies with a small budget for a campaign will
by necessity be Type I Error oriented. Companies with large budgets can
afford to be more concerned about not mailing to profitable customers
(Type II Error).
</p>
<p>&bull; Future campaigns: The Type I Error company thinks of several campaigns.
If the customer isn&rsquo;t profitable for the current campaign, hopefully he or
she will be for a subsequent campaign. A company conducting only one
campaign for the entire year has only one &ldquo;shot,&rdquo; so might be concerned
about Type II Error.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer orientation: A company thinking of its relationship with the cus-
tomer as transactional will be Type I Error oriented &ndash; if the contact pays
off right now, do the contact; if not, don&rsquo;t contact. A more relationship-
oriented company will be more Type II Error oriented &ndash; even if the contact
doesn&rsquo;t pay off now, it is part of nourishing the long-term relationship with
the customer.
</p>
<p>&bull; CRM strategy : Langerak and Verhoef (2003) distinguish &ldquo;tactical&rdquo; ver-
sus &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; CRM strategies. Tactical CRM views CRM strictly as a
marketing efficiency tool. Companies with this view are more Type I Error
oriented. Strategic CRM views CRM as a vehicle to cultivate the customer
relationship and maximize lifetime value. Companies with this view care
about Type II Error.
</p>
<p>In summary, when expenditures are held accountable and the &ldquo;warm and
fuzzy&rdquo; side of marketing is considered a luxury, companies will be Type I
Error oriented. They will contact only the customers they know are good
responders. The upside is high ROI. The downside, however, is catering only
to customers who pay off in the short term and not developing marginal
customers. Eventually, the company is left with a solid although relatively
small group of loyal customers. The marginal customer has been allowed
to drift away to competition. The company would have to conduct a re-
acquisition campaign to lure back these customers. It would contact deeply
down its prioritized list, committing many Type I Errors, but avoiding the
Type II Errors that got it into this mess.
</p>
<p>While over-emphasis on Type I Errors can lead to trouble, so can over-
emphasis on Type II Error. Such companies will contact a lot of customers,
even if they are not profitable in the short-run. The problem is, they may
not be profitable in the long-run either. The &ldquo;warm and fuzzy&rdquo; aspect of
marketing may result in too much wasted effort spent on customers who turn
out not to be profitable over any time horizon. Before we know it, the total
marketing budget has mushroomed, marketing productivity is low, and even
loyal customers are being flooded with unwanted contacts. Such a company
may painfully have to pull in the reigns, not mail as deeply down the list,
and reduce total expenditures. Sales may decrease, but ROI will increase.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.3 The Process in Detail 273
</p>
<p>Obviously one wants to balance Type I and Type II Errors in the long-run,
and at a minimum, database marketers need to be aware of the two types of
errors when deciding exactly where to draw the cut-off for implementing pre-
dictive modeling. It is a task for senior management as well as the specialist
designing the campaign.
</p>
<p>10.3.5.5 Choice-Based Segmentation
</p>
<p>The lift table, individual score, and budget constrained methods for target-
ing customers are for situations where the predictive model has measured the
probability of response or total sales volume that will result from a database
marketing campaign. In some situations, however, the predictive model is
measuring customer loyalty, i.e., the probability the customer will purchase in
the absence of any marketing effort. In that case, the company may not want
to target their 100% loyal customers, because these customers will purchase
no matter what, and their chance of purchasing will not be enhanced by mar-
keting efforts. At the other extreme, they do not want to target customers who
cannot be swayed because their preference for the company is just too low.
In this case, it may be better to target the customers &ldquo;in the middle.&rdquo; This
is known as &ldquo;choice-based segmentation&rdquo; (Gensch 1984; Gensch et al. 1990).
</p>
<p>Gensch (1984) and Gench et al. (1990) illustrate choice-based segmentation
using a multinomial logit model (Chapter 15):
</p>
<p>Pik =
eVik
</p>
<p>J&sum;
j=1
</p>
<p>eVij
(10.9a)
</p>
<p>Vik =
M&sum;
</p>
<p>m=1
</p>
<p>βmXikm (10.9b)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Pik = Probability customer i purchases from firm k.
Vik = Customer i&rsquo;s preference for firm k.
Xikm = Value of attribute m for firm k for customer i.
βm = Importance of attribute m in determining preference.
M = Number of attributes used to evaluate firms.
J = Number of firms.
</p>
<p>The model translates customer ratings of each firm along each ofM attributes
into the probability they will purchase from each firm. The data available for
the model are each customer&rsquo;s attribute ratings and purchase choices. Vik is
not directly observed, but is calculated from Equation 10.9b and interpreted
as preference, because higher Vik translates into higher likelihood of purchase
via Equation 10.9a.</p>

<p>Lost Switchables Competitives Loyals
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.6 Choice-based segmentation for selecting customers to target (From Gensch
1984).
</p>
<p>Figure 10.6 shows a graph of probability of purchase as a function of pref-
erence. It identifies &ldquo;Loyal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Switchable,&rdquo; &ldquo;Competitive,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lost&rdquo; cus-
tomers, depending on their preference value Vik. Loyals have a very high
likelihood of buying from the firm, and this probability will not change much
even if Vik changes a little bit. The customer&rsquo;s attribute ratings for the brand
are so high that improving them a little bit, which will increase Vik, will not
appreciably change the likelihood of purchase. The same goes for the Lost
customer. Their Vik is so low that even if firm k were to improve on the
attributes and Vik changed a little bit, it wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to get them to
purchase from the firm. In contrast are the Competitives and Switchables,
whose Vik&rsquo;s are in the steeply increasing portion of the curve in Fig. 10.6. The
Competitives lean toward firm k, but there are some to be gained, or more
ominously, lost, if Vik changes. The Switchables lean away from firm k, but
if firm k can improve just a little bit, there is much to be gained in purchase
probability.
</p>
<p>One strategy is to target the Switchables and the Competitives because
if the firm can improve itself a little bit on one or a few of the attributes,
the resulting increase in preference will be significant. Gensch et al. (1990)
illustrate the approach for a B2B firm, and demonstrate through a natural
experiment that salespersons who focused on Switchables and Competitives
outperformed salespersons who did not.

<p>Choice-based segmentation is a rich way of selecting customers to target
based on a predictive model. It stands out from the other customer selection
methods because those methods focus on response as the dependent variable,
whereas choice-based segmentation focuses on probability of purchase as the
dependent variable. The responsiveness of the customer is inferred from their
location on the graph in Fig. 10.6.</p>

<p>to a large number of customers. The question is, which of these customers
should be mailed a catalog this year, 2003.
</p>
<p>The behavior to be modeled (the dependent variable) is whether the cus-
tomer responded to last year&rsquo;s mailing. Potential predictors include the &ldquo;typ-
ical&rdquo; RFM variables as well as customer characteristics. In compiling the
data, not many customer characteristics were available, so most of the as-
sembled database consists of previous behavior variables. These are listed in</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.4 A Predictive Modeling Example 277
</p>
<p>Table 10.13. Data include dollars spent, number of orders, number of items
bought, and number of product lines purchased. Also, data on mode of
payment (credit card as well as specific type of credit card, versus phone
orders) are available, along with whether the purchase was for a gift (the
orientation of the catalog is toward gifts, but customers can certainly buy for
themselves). Variable 40 is the dependent variable, did the customer purchase
in the Fall of 2002?
</p>
<p>Many of the variables are highly related to each other. For example, First
Season Dollars (FORDSLS) + Latest Season Dollars (LORDSLS) + Other
Season Dollars (not quantified) = Dollars This Year (SLSLYR). As a result,
FORDSLS, LORDSLS, and SLSLYR will be highly correlated.
</p>
<p>No pre-processing was necessary for these data, as they are mostly contin-
uous variables with very few missing. The 101,000 observations were divided
into 30,000 for calibration and 71,000 for validation.
</p>
<p>A stepwise logistic regression was estimated. Stepwise is particularly useful
when there a lot of potential predictors with no particular theory as to which
ones should be most useful (e.g., should first season or latest season orders
be more predictive, and what even should be the sign of these variables?).
Logistic regression is easy to estimate, in this case, on SPSS. The results of
the estimation are shown in Table 10.14.
</p>
<p>Table 10.14 shows this year&rsquo;s orders have a large impact on response,
as do orders from last year, 2, 3, and 4 years ago, in diminishing degrees.
Buying with a credit card (CHARGSLS) decreases response, but buying with
American Express (AMEXSLS) or MasterCard/Visa (MCVISSLS) tends
to increase response. This means American Express, Visa, and MasterCard
customers have higher response, and implicitly that the other credit card

<p>customers (e.g., Discover) have lower response. One counter-intuitive result
is that latest period number of lines ordered (LORDLNS) has a positive
coefficient, whereas first period number of lines ordered (FORDLNS) has a
negative coefficient. One would think both variables should have a positive
coefficient, or at least the same sign. Multicollinearity could be distorting
the signs. Stepwise should eliminate this because it tends to discard one of
two correlated variables. But this can&rsquo;t be guaranteed.
</p>
<p>Figure 10.7 shows lift charts and tables for both the calibration and vali-
dation samples. The top-decile lift for the calibration sample is close to 4 to
1 (0.347/0.091 = 3.8). So the top decile customers are four times as likely to
respond as the average customer. Using Equation 10.7, we can calculate that
the maximum top-decile lift is 10. So the lift achieved by this model is 38%
of what maximally could have been achieved.

<p>There is no fall-off in performance for the validation sample. This is not
rare. Large sample sizes coupled with relatively few predictors often spell</p>

<p>success for the validation sample. However that this does not mean the model
will be perfectly accurate when implemented. All the data &ndash; calibration and
validation &ndash; are from 2002. Things might have changed in 2003 that would
render the model no longer accurate. This can only be assessed by imple-
menting the model in 2003. It would be impractical to run a test because the
holiday season is a short period.
</p>
<p>Table 10.15 uses the decile cut-off approach to select customers to target.
Average order size is assumed to be $60 with a contribution of 40%. A more
thorough analysis would model order size as well as response and combine
the two, but it is not unheard of to focus on response and assume an average
purchase size (e.g., Bult and Wansbeek 1995). Contact cost is $1 per customer
(printing and postage) and fulfillment cost (packing, packaging, and mail) is
$5 per order. Therefore, the profit per customer for decile k is rk &times; ($60 &times;
0.40&minus; $5)&minus; $1. Table 10.12 predicts that deciles 1&ndash;5 are profitable. Decile 6
is marginally unprofitable. A Type II Error-oriented company might mail to
decile 6 in addition to the top five deciles.
</p>
<p>This example illustrates the full predictive modeling process, from problem
definition to implementation plan. The case was a typical catalog example,
where 0&ndash;1 response to the mailing was the prime behavior of interest, mostly
RFM and previous behavior variables were used for predictors, and stepwise
logistic regression was used to select variables and estimate the predictive
model. The performance of the model appeared to be acceptably good (3.8</p>

</p>
<p>to 1 top-decile lift) with no fall-off on the validation sample. Implementation
was a simple matter of using the decile cut-off approach.
</p>
<p>10.5 Long-Term Considerations
</p>
<p>While predictive modeling is of considerable use in targeting customers for
particular marketing campaigns, there are important long-term issues in using
these models. We discuss these issues in this section.
</p>
<p>10.5.1 Preaching to the Choir
</p>
<p>Repeated use of predictive models can affect the size of the company&rsquo;s loyal
customer base. This happens as follows: The model classifies customers with
favorable RFM scores in high deciles, and hence they are selected to be con-
tacted. As a result, their RFM scores improve while those not contacted
develop lower RFM scores. The next time the model is applied, the same
customers score in the high deciles and the same customers in the low deciles,
and the cycle continues. Over time, one group of customers receives a great
deal of attention; another group receives little. The former group has become
better customers, but the latter group has probably become worse.
</p>
<p>The predicament can arise due to an over-emphasis on Type I Error. The
answer strategically is occasionally to contact low-decile customers, even if
they are not likely to respond to the current mailing. This contact is setting
up the customer to respond to the next mailing. This is a Type II Error
strategy. In more analytical terms, an optimal contact model is needed that
takes into account the long-term management of the customer. The model
needs to be forward looking &ndash; it needs to recognize that an investment may
not pay off in the short run but will in the long term. See Chapter 28 for a
discussion of optimal contact models.
</p>
<p>10.5.2 Model Shelf Life and Selectivity Bias
</p>
<p>A model has a &ldquo;shelf-life,&rdquo; i.e., the number of applications for which its accu-
racy holds up. Accuracy may decline over time because of changing market
conditions, especially competitive activity. The model therefore needs to be
re-estimated. However, a problem can arise because only customers selected
by the predictive model have received marketing efforts. For example, only
1,000,000 of the company&rsquo;s 10,000,000 customers may have received a special
catalog. This targeting was based on a predictive model that is now possibly</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.5 Long-Term Considerations 281
</p>
<p>obsolete. Re-estimating the model is a good idea, but the catalog was only
mailed to those who were predicted to respond in the first place. These cus-
tomers provide the sample for the new predictive model. However, the results
of a model estimated on these customers may not apply to the entire sample
of customers.
</p>
<p>This is an example of &ldquo;selectivity bias.&rdquo; To understand the problem statis-
tically, consider the case of estimating the relationship between wages and job
training when only certain workers (e.g., ambitious or high aptitude) obtain
training. If these variables are not included in the regression of wages versus
job training, the result is a biased coefficient for the job training variable.
Statistically, there are unobserved factors (ambition, aptitude) that affect
both obtaining job training and the obtaining good wages:
</p>
<p>Wages = f(Job Training) + ε (10.10a)
</p>
<p>Job Training = ε&prime; (10.10b)
</p>
<p>Both ε&rsquo;s include worker ambition and aptitude and so are correlated. Since
ε&prime; is correlated with Job Training and ε&prime; is correlated with ε, Job Training
and ε are correlated and we have bias (Maddala 1983; Wooldridge 2002).
</p>
<p>Our situation is similar but not identical. We measure all variables that
determine receipt of the catalog, so if we include them in the re-estimated
catalog response model, there should be no selectivity bias. However, the
RFM predictor variables are &ldquo;selectively&rdquo; changed by who receives the cata-
log. In particular, since R and F are contingent on purchases, customers with
high error terms end up with different values for R and F than those with
low error terms. If the error terms are not correlated over time, this is just a
one-period effect. However, if the errors are correlated over time, then R and
F become correlated with these errors, setting up the potential for bias.
</p>
<p>To explore this issue, we generated a simulation where we estimate
an initial predictive model, repeatedly use it for targeting, and then re-
estimate it at a later date. We assume response is generated by a probit
model:
</p>
<p>Z&lowast;im = β0 + β1Recencyim + β2Frequencyim
+β3Monetary V alueim + εim (10.11a)
</p>
<p>Responseim =
</p>
<p>{
Y es if Z&lowast;im &gt; 0
No if Z&lowast;im &le; 0
</p>
<p>(10.11b)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>Responseim = Signifies whether customer i responds to the mth mailing.
Recencyim = Recency score for customer i at the time of the mth mailing.
Frequencyim = Frequency score for customer i at the time of themth mailing.
Monetary V alueim = Monetary value score for customer i at the time of the
</p>
<p>mth mailing.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>282 10 The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>For the purpose of illustration, we assume the true response-generating
process, governed by the β&rsquo;s, remains constant over time. The unobserved
factors, ε, differ across individuals but are correlated over time for a given
individual. The hypothesis is that if this correlation is nonzero, it will induce
bias when we re-estimate the predictive model.
</p>
<p>We assume the company has 1,000,000 customers and we randomly gen-
erate initial RFM values for each customer. Then we simulate a mailing to
a random sample of 10,000 customers. We randomly generate response ac-
cording to Equations 10.11 using β0 = &minus;4.5, β1 = &minus;0.05, β2 = 0.07, and
β3 = 0.01. Therefore, the most likely responders have responded recently,
frequently, and have high monetary value scores. We use the response to this
mailing to estimate Equation 10.11a, and call this the &ldquo;Initial Model.&rdquo; The
coefficients of this model should on average equal the true coefficients. We
then update the RFM variables for each customer, use the Initial Model to
score all 1,000,000 customers, and select the top 200,000 for a mailing. Next
we see who responds, update the RFM variables, re-score customers, and
mail again. After this third mailing, we re-estimate the predictive model and
call it the &ldquo;Re-Estimated Model.&rdquo; Note the Re-Estimated Model uses as data
the 200,000 customers who were most recently mailed. The reason is that,
although it was not the case in our simulation, we want to see if the model
has changed. We therefore want to use only recent data.
</p>
<p>We then use both the Initial Model and the Re-Estimated model to target
a fourth mailing. Our hypothesis is that the Re-Estimated model should be
biased if the ε&rsquo;s are correlated over time. We also expect that as a result, the
Re-Estimated model will generate poorer results on a fourth mailing.
</p>
<p>Figure 10.8 shows the estimated results. As expected, the Initial Model&rsquo;s
coefficients are unbiased, and the Re-Estimated Model&rsquo;s coefficients are unbi-
ased if the correlation ρ = 0.0, but biased if ρ = 0.4, and even more biased if
ρ = 0.8. These results show that if we re-estimate a model that has been used
repeatedly to target customers, the new model has biased coefficients, even
if the underlying process generating response has not changed. This nicely
confirms our hypothesis.
</p>
<p>However, Fig. 10.9 shows two surprising results if we apply the Initial and
Re-Estimated Models to a fourth mailing: (1) Both models become more
accurate as the correlation increases, i.e., they select customers with higher
response rates. This may be due to the fact that the responders to a given
mailing generally have higher ε&rsquo;s, and because they responded, they are more
likely to have their R and F values favorably updated for the next mailing,
where their high ε&rsquo;s persist. (2) The Re-Estimated model does not become
worse as it becomes biased (ρ = 0.4 or 0.8). In fact, it becomes better than
the Initial Model. We have an example where a biased model is more accurate
than an unbiased model! The reason for this also lies in the selection of cus-
tomers with high ε&rsquo;s. The Re-Estimated model indeed is biased, because the
RFM variables become correlated with the error term over time. However, this
information is incorporated in the biased coefficients, so although they are</p>

tive models, depending on correlation between unobserved customer factors over time.
</p>
<p>biased, they incorporate more information, the correlation between the error
term and the RFM variables. Hence the Re-Estimated Model performs better.
</p>
<p>This of course is a surprising result but in retrospect quite sensible. Essen-
tially, the RFM variables become more informative as they become updated
over time, singling out customers with higher ε&rsquo;s versus lower ε&rsquo;s. In fact,
when we inspected the simulated ε&rsquo;s for the customers selected by the Re-
Estimated model but not by the Initial Model, we found that the former
selected customers with higher ε&rsquo;s on average. Obviously, this is an intrigu-
ing result that needs further investigation.
</p>
<p>Managerially, the result exacerbates the &ldquo;Preaching to the Choir&rdquo; effect
discussed earlier. Repeated use of a model identifies the best responders,
and re-estimating the model identifies them even more accurately. The most
straightforward remedy would be to conduct another test, randomly select-
ing 10,000 of the 1,000,000 customers, and re-estimating the model. An-
other possibility, needing further investigation, is whether two-stage least
squares might generate consistent, albeit biased, results. Still another possi-
bility would be to develop a selectivity-model in the same vein as described
by Maddala (1983) or Wooldridge (2002).

<p>10.5.3 Learning from the Interpretation
of Predictive Models
</p>
<p>The role of predictive modeling emphasized in this chapter is efficient tar-
geting. However, there is much to be learned from predictive models. For</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10.5 Long-Term Considerations 285
</p>
<p>example, a churn model for a wireless phone company might not only predict
churn but reveal that customers with older phones are most likely to churn.
This suggests that company offer such customers special deals on new phones
to keep them from churning (Chapter 24).
</p>
<p>Sharing the interpretation of predictive models is important for several
reasons: (1) Potential to employ the insights to improve marketing (as in the
churn example above). (2) Assurance that the targeted customer is consistent
with the overall marketing plan (e.g., the predictive model may find young
people are more likely to respond to this particular campaign, but older
people might be the firm&rsquo;s target group). (3) Assurance to senior managers
that the model driving their business is credible. For example, it would be
difficult to sell a model-based cross-selling campaign to senior management
based on a model that is not interpretable.
</p>
<p>Gillett (1999) recommends that predictive models should be implemented
as part of a team effort involving analysts, database managers, CRM man-
agers, and senior marketing managers. This way the insights are shared and
credibility established, and all parties are able to do their jobs better.
</p>
<p>10.5.4 Predictive Modeling Is a Process
to Be Managed
</p>
<p>It is common to think of predictive modeling as the statistical model &ndash; logistic
regression, neural nets, machine learning, etc. But predictive modeling is a
process; there are many choices along the way. As a result, there are various
predictive modeling approaches, depending on these choices.
</p>
<p>Neslin et al. (2006a) emphasize this in the analysis of their churn model-
ing tournament. They found that variables representing factors such as time
spent on various tasks, the method used for selecting variables, as well as
the statistical method, tended to be correlated. The authors factor analyzed
these data and interpreted the factors in terms of five approaches to predictive
modeling:
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Logit&rdquo;: This entailed the use of logistic regression, and exploratory data
analysis and stepwise for variable selection. Less time was spent on prepar-
ing files in comparison to selecting variables and estimating the model.
Practitioners as opposed to academics were associated with this approach.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Tree&rdquo;: This was characterized by reliance on decision trees, low reliance on
exploratory analysis or stepwise variable selection, and the use of estima-
tion and test sub-samples of the calibration data. The approach involved
a lot of time allocated for estimating the model, and entailed more time
in total.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Practical&rdquo;: This approach did not emphasize any particular statistical
model but placed strong emphasis on common sense in selecting variables.
Users of this approach tended to allocate more time to downloading data,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>286 10 The Predictive Modeling Process
</p>
<p>although less time in total on the entire process, and did not sub-divide
the data into estimation and test sub-samples. Practitioners were fairly
strongly associated with this factor.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Discriminant&rdquo;: This approach relied heavily on discriminant analysis as
the statistical model and cluster analysis for selecting variables. Users of
this approach spent less time on data cleaning and more on estimation,
and ended up using more variables than average in their models.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Explain&rdquo;: This approach was not associated with any particular statistical
model, but was strongly associated with self-reported use of theory, factor
analysis, and cluster analysis for variable selection. This suggests users of
this approach were interested in understanding churn as well as (or as a
means toward) predicting it. Users of this approach tended to use fewer
variables in their final model, and explored several estimation techniques
before selecting the final one.
</p>
<p>The authors regressed each entry&rsquo;s prediction performance versus factor
scores describing the degree to which each entry used each approach. They
found the Logit and Tree approaches tended to perform best, Practical was a
notch below, Explain was a notch below that, and Discrimant had the worst
performance.
</p>
<p>These particular results may not hold universally, but the analysis em-
phasizes that predictive modeling is a process, more than just a statistical
technique. The implication is that various approaches can work but must be
managed. For example, if a firm&rsquo;s analysts are using the Tree approach, they
will require more time, especially on estimating their models. This means
that investment in faster hardware may be worthwhile. Analysts using the
Explain approach may not generate as accurate predictions, but these ana-
lysts should be tapped for the insights they are generating. If those insights
are not forthcoming or illuminating enough, the analysts should be encour-
aged to use a Logit or Tree approach, which at least will gain accuracy if not
as much insight.

<p>10.6 Future Research
</p>
<p>This chapter has several implications for future research. These include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Appropriate sizes for calibration and validation samples: Guidelines are
needed for the best sample sizes in absolute as well as relative terms.
</p>
<p>&bull; The relative importance of different types of variables in different types of
predictive models: Are customer characteristics worth the added expense
of acquiring from list vendors? How important are competitive variables?
How valuable are variables that measure previous marketing efforts and
responses to those efforts?
</p>
<p>&bull; New methods for variable selection: New methods are needed to select
variables for inclusion in predictive models. The ideal method would avoid</p>

</p>
<p>omitted variables bias that arises from using stepwise, and the effort in-
volved with factor analysis, while coming up with a parsimonious model.
</p>
<p>&bull; New methods for statistical models: Machine learning algorithms (vector
support machines, boosting and bagging, Bayesian Networks, etc.) need
to be thoroughly investigated and compared with simpler techniques.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use of Type II Tobit : When predicting a 0&ndash;1 response and level of response,
is a Type II Tobit better than a regression and logistic regression estimated
separately and multiplied together?
</p>
<p>&bull; Perfecting the n-tile cut-off approach: We need better methods for deter-
mining how many n-tiles to use.
</p>
<p>&bull; Optimal cut-off scores: More work is needed to follow up on Bult and
Wansbeek (1995), comparing their work with the n-tile cut-off approach.
</p>
<p>&bull; Balancing Type I and Type II Errors: Methods are needed that allow
database marketers to quantify the costs of Type I and Type II Errors
and determine an optimal cut-off score based on their consideration.
</p>
<p>&bull; Optimal contact strategy models for determining cut-offs for successive
campaigns: There is promising work in this area (Chapter 28) but more is
needed that takes into account wear-in, wear-out, and Type I and Type II
Errors.
</p>
<p>&bull; Selectivity and model wearout : How should one re-estimate predictive mod-
els when the customers that provide data for those models have been se-
lected to receive marketing efforts by previous marketing models?
</p>
<p>&bull; Does model interpretation pay off ? Are firms that pay attention to the
insights generated by predictive models able to translate those insights into
long-run success? What organizational forms best encourage sharing of
these insights? Does outsourcing the estimation or implementation phases
of predictive modeling result in fewer shared insights, and lower long-term
performance?
</p>
<p>&bull; What are the approaches to the predictive modeling process and how can
they be better managed? Neslin et al. (2006a) show there are different
approaches to predictive modeling, defined by the choices analysts make
as they move through the process. Are there generic approaches that apply
across all kinds of models, and if so, what are the costs and benefits of
each, and how should these approaches be managed?</p>

<p>Statistical Issues in
Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>Abstract Whereas Chapter 10 describes the basic process of predictive mod-
eling, this chapter goes into depth on three key issues: selection of variables,
treatment of missing data, and evaluation of models. Topics covered include
stepwise selection and principal components methods of variable selection;
imputation methods, missing variable dummies, and data fusion techniques
for missing data; and validation techniques and metrics for evaluating pre-
dictive models.
</p>
<p>The word (scientific) &ldquo;model&rdquo; has several meanings. Here we focus on statis-
tical models. A model is, in effect, a statement of reality or its approximation.
Most phenomena in the social sciences are extremely complex. With a model
we simplify the reality and focus on a manageable number of factors. For
example, economists often assume a world where there are only two prod-
ucts available, apples and oranges, in order to understand the relationship
between the price of an apple and the price of an orange. Economists know
that the assumed world is far from the reality. However, they devise a model
to allow them to answer the question of their interests within the assumed
world. Once economists build knowledge from a simple world, they often ex-
tend their model to study more complex world that may be closer to the
reality.
</p>
<p>Managers build a statistical model to understand and predict variables
of importance to their firms. Consider a manager in a bank who wants to
determine to whom he or she should issue credit cards. Or the manager wants
to know who will default and who will not. It is impossible to completely
understand why consumers default and identify all the factors influencing
customer&rsquo;s default behavior. Simplifying the reality, the bank manager sets
up a statistical model that relates customer&rsquo;s default behavior to only two
important factors, the income and the education. We know that this simple
model is not very close to the reality. There surely are thousands of other
variables that may influence customer&rsquo;s default behavior. The manager does
not include them into the model because they are either minor factors or

</p>
<p>they are not available in the database. Hopefully, the manager could reduce
the default rate by 80% with the help of this simple model.
</p>
<p>This chapter describes the fundamentals of a statistical model building.
We do not discuss statistical basics that can be found in other textbooks
on statistics or marketing research. Instead, we focus on issues that are
important to database marketers but are not well-treated in other books. We
begin our discussion on the managerial justification for building a statistical
model. Then we discuss three important statistical issues that are of prime
importance to database marketers: model/variable selection, treatment of
missing data, and evaluation of the model.
</p>
<p>11.1 Economic Justification for Building
a Statistical Model
</p>
<p>Why do we want to build a statistical model? What is the economic ben-
efit from building a model? Database marketers have often used the decile
analysis to evaluate the economic value of a model. The concept may best
be explained by an example. Suppose that a bank has budget available to
issue 2,000 credit cards and needs to determine who should receive a card
among 10,000 credit card applicants. It will lose $400 if a customer defaults
and gain $100 if the customer does not default. And assume that the market
average default probability is 11.5%. Without a statistical model, the bank
does not know who will default and will not. Hence, it may randomly select
2,000 customers among 10,000 applicants and issue credit cards. Given the
market (average) default probability of 11.5%, 230 (0.115 &times; 2,000) customers
will default and 1,770 customers will not. Therefore, with randomly issuing
credit cards to 2,000 applicants, the bank will collect total profits of $85,000
(1,770 &times;$100&minus; 230&times; $400).
</p>
<p>Now assume the bank develops a statistical model estimated using data
from current customers. Based on the estimated model, it can predict the de-
fault probability for each of the 10,000 applicants. Customers are ranked in
descending order in terms of their predicted default probabilities. The ranked
customers are evenly divided into ten groups (or deciles), each with 1,000 cus-
tomers as shown in Table 11.1. The second column in Table 11.1 represents
the average of the predicted default probabilities over 1,000 customers. In-
stead of randomly selecting 2,000 customers to receive a credit card, it targets
the 2,000 customers in decile 9 and 10, who are least likely to default.1 The
third column shows the percentage of actual defaulters. Eleven out of 1,000
</p>
<p>1 We could actually find the breakeven default rate to maximize the profit if we were
not constrained to issue only 2,000 cards. The bank should issue the credit card if the
expected profit is greater than zero. Therefore, the profit maximizing rule is &ldquo;issue card
if $100&times; (1&minus; p)&minus; $400&times; p &gt; 0 where p is the default probability. Hence, the breakeven
default probability is 0.2. That is, the bank should issue the credit card if the predicted</p>

<p>customers actually default in decile 9 while only one customer defaults in
decile 10. The bank collects profits of $194,000 (1,988 &times; $100&minus;12&times;$400) by
employing the statistical model. As a result, the bank can increase the profit
from $85,000 to $194,000 with the model. Therefore, the economic benefit of
the statistical model is $109,000.
</p>
<p>The economic benefit of a statistical model can only be realized by building
a good model that provides accurate predictions. The predictive model in
Table 11.1 can be said to be a good model since its predicted default rates are
very close to the corresponding actual default rates. However, we can easily
think of more accurate model that perfectly forecasts who will default and
who will not. In the following three sections, we discuss three key statistical
(however, often ignored) issues that will help database marketers to develop
more accurate models.
</p>
<p>11.2 Selection of Variables and Models
</p>
<p>11.2.1 Variable Selection
</p>
<p>Most predictive models (e.g., regression, logistic regression, neural nets) can
be stated in the following regression-type format:
</p>
<p>Y = f(X1, X2, X3, . . . XK) + ε (11.1)
</p>
<p>where Y is the variable being predicted (customer response, customer value,
etc.), the X&rsquo;s are the potential predictor variables, and ε are other (ran-
dom) variables that have not been observed by researchers. Note that &ldquo;K&rdquo; is
</p>
<p>default probability is less than 0.2. Applied to the data given in Table 11.1, credit cards
should be issued to 8,000 applicants (from decile 3 to 10) to maximize its profits.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>294 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>the number of potential predictor variables (including the intercept). In real-
world applications, the value for K can be very high, easily in the hundreds if
not in the thousands. This is because there are often many demographic vari-
ables and other customer characteristics available, several measures of pre-
vious customer behavior (RFM, etc.), and several previous contact variables
(e.g., marketing contacts). There are several reasons why all K variables can-
not be included in the model: (1) Computation time &ndash; for example, a neural
net would take an enormous amount of time to run with 300 predictors.
(2) Feasibility &ndash; in a decision-tree model, one would run out of observations
if all 300 predictors were used. (3) Overfitting &ndash; there is a danger that using
300 variables will result in &ldquo;overfitting,&rdquo; whereby the model is able to find a
unique idiosyncratic combination of variables that can predict an individual
observation, but the relationship implied by this combination does not hold
up in general. (4) Interpretation &ndash; it is often difficult to interpret a model
with 300 variables. As a result, the model cannot be easily communicated to
upper level management, and hence is less likely to be trusted and used.
</p>
<p>The ideal approach to selecting which variables should be in the model
would be theory. To the extent that theory is available for why certain vari-
ables should be in the model, these variables should be included (e.g., if
data on customer complaints are available, this variable should certainly be
included in a model of customer churn). However, very often there is not
good theory available that we would be confident in relying on. In this case,
we should rely on statistical methods to select variables to be included in
the model. There are several techniques available for this: (1) all-subset re-
gression, (2) step-wise techniques, (3) principal components regression, and
(4) other advanced techniques. We discuss these methods in this section.
</p>
<p>11.2.1.1 All-Possible Subset Regression
</p>
<p>All possible subset regression is frequently used to determine the optimal set
of independent variables. This procedure first requires the fitting of all possi-
ble combinations among the available independent variables. For example, if
three independent variables are available, we need to fit eight regression equa-
tions, &empty;, {X1}, {X2}, {X3}, {X1, X2}, {X1, X3}, {X2, X3}, and {X1, X2,
X3}. Next, select the best regression equation using some statistical criteria
such as adjusted R2, AIC (Akaike Information Criteria) or BIC (Bayesian
Information Criteria):
</p>
<p>Adjusted R2 = 1&minus;
[
n&minus; 1
n&minus; k
</p>
<p>] (
1&minus;R2) (11.2a)
</p>
<p>AIC = &minus;2 log L̂+ 2k (11.2b)
BIC = &minus;2 log L̂+ k log n (11.2c)
</p>
<p>where n is the number of observations, k is the number of predictors includ-
ing the intercept and L̂ is the value of the likelihood function achieved by</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.2 Selection of Variables and Models 295
</p>
<p>the model. Different from R2, these criteria penalize more complex models
so that a simple model may often be chosen if the increase in fit by including
additional variables is not large enough. We select the best model with the
largest adjusted R2 or the lowest AIC or BIC. The adjusted R2 is used for
linear regression models while AIC and BIC can be used for both linear and
non-linear models. Assuming that the model errors (ε) are normally distrib-
uted, the AIC becomes n log σ̂2(k) + 2k where log σ̂2(k) is the variance of ε.
AIC however still tends to select models that overfit the data. To overcome
this difficulty, the BIC penalizes the number of estimated parameters, and
hence the number of variables included in the model, more strongly (2 for
AIC and logn for BIC ) than the AIC (Schwarz 1978).
</p>
<p>The major weakness of all-possible subset regression is that the method
is not practical when there are a large number of independent variables. If
there are 50 variables, we need to run 250 = 1.16&times; 1015 regressions. Most of
commercial statistical packages have all possible subset regressions but they
cannot practically handle more than 30 independent variables.
</p>
<p>11.2.1.2 Stepwise Selection
</p>
<p>An alternative method to select an optimal set of independent variables is a
stepwise selection method that combines &ldquo;forward selection&rdquo; and &ldquo;backward
elimination&rdquo;. The forward selection procedure begins with fitting a simple
regression model for each of the K &minus; 1 potential X variables. For each re-
gression model, the F statistic for testing whether or not the slope is zero is
obtained. The X variable with the largest F value is the candidate for first
variable to be included. If this F value exceeds a predetermined level F0, the
X variable is added. Otherwise, the process terminates with no variables in
the model. Suppose that X1 is entered at step 1. Now the forward selection
routine fits all regression models with two X variables, where X1 is one of
the two. For each such regression, we compute the partial F test statistic
that will test whether or not βk = 0 when X1 and Xk are two variables in
the model. The X variable with the largest partial F value is the candidate
for addition. If this F value exceeds a predetermined level F0, the second
X variable is added. Otherwise, the process terminates. The forward selec-
tion continues until no further X variables can be added, at which point the
routine terminates.
</p>
<p>The backward elimination procedure is an attempt to achieve a similar
conclusion working from the other direction. That is, it begins with the re-
gression using all independent variables, and subsequently reduces the num-
ber of variables in the equation until a decision is reached on the equation to
use. The order of deletion is determined by using the partial F value. The
backward elimination begins with a regression containing all variables. The
partial F value is calculated for every predictor variable treated as though it
were the last variable to enter the regression equation. The variable for which</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>296 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>this F value is the smallest is the candidate for deletion. If this F value is
smaller than the predetermined level F1, the variable is dropped from the
model. Otherwise, the routine terminates. The backward elimination routine
continues until no further X variables can be deleted, at which point the
routine terminates.
</p>
<p>The most popular stepwise selection procedure combines forward selection
and backward elimination. It begins with the forward search procedure. And
assume that X1 is entered at step 1 and X2 is entered at step 2. Now the
backward elimination routine comes in to determine whether or not any of
these twoX variables already in the model (X1 andX2 in this case) should be
dropped. If a variable&rsquo;s partial F is smaller than the predetermined level F1,
the variable is dropped; otherwise, it is retained. The stepwise selection rou-
tine continues until no further X variables can be added or deleted, at which
point the search terminates. The stepwise selection allows an X variable to
be added into the model at an earlier stage and to be dropped subsequently,
if it is no longer useful in conjunction with variables added at later stages.
</p>
<p>The stepwise selection is computationally very efficient since it does not
need to evaluate the full factorial. However, because of its algorithmic char-
acteristics (e.g., sequential search), the stepwise selection often leads to the
sub-optimal solution. The relative merits and drawbacks of stepwise proce-
dures, lower computational costs versus sub-optimality, have been mainly
discussed within the linear regression context (Hocking 1976; Miller 1989).
</p>
<p>An issue often raised in conjunction with stepwise selection (although it
applies to all-possible subset regression as well) is the difficulty it can create in
interpreting the results. Stepwise will tend to eliminate a variable if (1) it has
little predictive power, or (2) it has predictive power but is highly correlated
with a variable that has better predictive power. In this latter case is where
difficulty in interpretation arises. For example, assume income predicts cus-
tomer profitability well, but age predicts even better, and income and age are
positively correlated. It is possible that stepwise regression will include age in
the final model, and eliminate income. But as a result, the estimated coeffi-
cient for age picks up not only the impact of age but the impact of income as
well &ndash; income is not in the model explicitly, so age serves as its representative.
How should we interpret an age coefficient of say $1,000? Taken literally, this
means that every additional year of the customer&rsquo;s age makes her or him
$1,000 more profitable. But implicitly, it&rsquo;s the additional age plus the extra
income that comes with age that makes the customer more profitable.
</p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, researchers should always ask themselves &ndash;
is this variable we&rsquo;ve included in the model serving to represent certain other
variables besides itself? If so, we need to be careful not to assume that chang-
ing that variable alone will induce the change in the dependent variable indi-
cated by its coefficient. An important example of this is if data on catalogs and
emails were available but stepwise selected only catalogs for the final model.
The coefficient for catalogs would reflect the impact of catalogs and emails
combined. If we just increase the number of catalogs without a concomitant</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.2 Selection of Variables and Models 297
</p>
<p>increase in emails, we may not achieve the gain in sales predicted by the co-
efficient for catalog. The careful researcher needs to be savvy in interpreting
coefficients when stepwise selection has been used.
</p>
<p>11.2.1.3 Principal Components Regression
</p>
<p>Massy (1965) developed principal components regression by combining princi-
pal components analysis and regression analysis. We first review the method
of principal components. Principal components analysis is a technique for
combining a large number of variables into a smaller number of variables,
while retaining as much information as possible in the original variables.
Suppose we have an n&times; k matrix of X of n observations on k variables, and
Σ is its variance&ndash;covariance matrix. The objective of principal components
analysis is to find a linear transformation of X into a new set of data de-
noted by P, where P is n &times; p and p &le; k. The p variables in P are called
&ldquo;factors&rdquo; and the n observations for each factor are called factor scores. The
data matrix P has certain desirable properties: (i) the p variables (columns)
of P are uncorrelated with each other (orthogonality), and (ii) each variable
in P, progressing from P1 to P2, etc., accounts for as much of the combined
variance of the X&rsquo;s as possible, consistent with being orthogonal to the pre-
ceding P &rsquo;s. The new variables correspond to the principal axes of the ellipsoid
formed by the scatter of sample points in the n dimensional space having the
elements of X as a basis. Hence, the principal components transformation is
a rotation from the originalX coordinate system to the system defined by the
principal axes of this ellipsoid.2 Specifically, the transformation to principal
components is given by
</p>
<p>P = M&prime;X (11.3)
</p>
<p>To see how M (p &times; n) is determined, post-multiply Equation 11.3 by P&prime;.
Then, PP&prime; = M&prime;XX&prime;M. XX&prime; is simply the variance&ndash;covariance matrix Σ.
The variance&ndash;covariance matrix for principal components PP&prime; = Λ should
be diagonal by virtue of requirement (i) above. Hence, we have:
</p>
<p>Λ = M&prime;ΣM (11.4)
</p>
<p>Equation 11.4 is an orthogonal similarity transformation diagonalizing the
symmetric matrix Σ. The transformation matrix M has an orthonormal set
of eigenvectors of Σ as its columns, and PP&prime; = Λ has the eigenvalues of Σ
as its diagonal elements. If the columns of M are ordered so that the first
diagonal element of Λ contains the largest eigenvalue of Σ, the second the
</p>
<p>2 The principal axes spanned by the elements of X are not invariant to changes in the
scales in which the variables are measured. Hence, X is usually standardized before the
transformation to principal components.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>298 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>next largest, etc., the principal components will be ordered as specified in
requirement (ii).
</p>
<p>Instead of fitting a linear regression Y = Xβ + ε, principal components
regression fits the following regression:
</p>
<p>Y = Pγ + ε (11.5)
</p>
<p>where P is factor scores from Equation 11.3. Once the values of P are deter-
mined from principal components analysis, the parameters γ can be estimated
by ordinary regression.
</p>
<p>Massy (1965) suggested that only a few factors should be included &ndash; actu-
ally, data reduction is its main purpose &ndash; but did not provide formal guidelines
to determine the number of factors. Marketers often employ heuristic meth-
ods. For example, a factor is selected if its eigenvalue is greater than one.
Basilevsky (1994) proposed an alternative criterion to determine the number
of factors using AIC, the Akaike&rsquo;s information criterion (Naik and Tsai 2004).
Or the number of factors can be selected judgmentally according to which
set of factors is easiest to interpret3.
</p>
<p>In summary, Principal Components Regression uses all the k original vari-
ables, but transforms them to a more manageable number of p factors. The
value of this approach hinges on the interpretability of the p factors. Very
often the factors generated by the transformation matrix M are difficult to
interpret. It turns out however that M is not unique in that, for a given
number of factors p, there are other &ldquo;rotated&rdquo; versions of M that can pro-
duce a factor score matrix P retaining the same amount of information as in
the original X matrix (see Lehmann et al. 1998 for more discussion). Often,
but not always, the rotated version of M produces factor scores that are eas-
ier to interpret. Hence, we recommend principal components regression only
when the original independent variables are highly collinear with one another,
when there are a great number of potential explanatory variables, and when
the factors can be easily interpreted. Principal components regression can
be implemented easily in SAS or SPSS by running the principal component
analysis, interpreting the factors it yields, computing the factor scores, and
then running a regression with these factor scores as independent variables.
</p>
<p>11.2.1.4 Other Techniques
</p>
<p>Recently, Naik et al. (2000) introduced a new reduction technique called
sliced inverse regression to the marketing community. The method was orig-
inally developed by Li (1991). Similar to principal components regression, it
attempts to extract important factors (a linear combination of all the origi-
nal independent variables) to reduce dimension. But sliced inverse regression
</p>
<p>3 Principal components analysis generates a &ldquo;loadings matrix,&rdquo; representing the correla-
tion between each factor and each original X variable, that can be used to interpret the
factors. See Lehmann et al. (1998) for more details.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.2 Selection of Variables and Models 299
</p>
<p>provides simple tests for determining the number of factors to retain and for
assessing the significance of factor-loading coefficients (the elements of M ).
The composition of factors is determined objectively on the basis of t-values.
Naik et al. (2000) demonstrated that sliced inverse regression performs bet-
ter than principal components regression using Monte Carlo experiments and
two real-world applications. However, sliced inverse regression is also not free
from the interpretation problems. So we only recommend its usage when the
derived factors are meaningful.
</p>
<p>Finally, the variable selection problem has attracted the interest of statis-
ticians interested in applying newly developed Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) estimation methods. In the previous section, we discussed the rel-
ative merits and drawbacks of stepwise procedures, lower computational
costs versus sub-optimality. George and McCulloch (1993) proposed a sto-
chastic search variable selection model (SSVS) to overcome the problems of
all-possible subset regression (computational costs) and the stepwise selec-
tion (sub-optimality). Their procedure uses probabilistic considerations for
selecting promising subsets of X&rsquo;s. SSVS is based on embedding the entire
regression setup in a hierarchical Bayes normal mixture model, where la-
tent variables are used to identify subset choices. The promising subsets of
independent variables can be identified as those with higher posterior prob-
abilities. The computational burden is then alleviated by using the Gibbs
sampler to indirectly sample from this multinomial posterior distribution on
the set of possible subset choices. Those subsets with higher probability can
then be identified by their more frequent appearance in the Gibbs sample.
</p>
<p>11.2.2 Variable Transformations
</p>
<p>One of the most popular models used among database marketers is the clas-
sical linear regression model. It is easy to apply and its interpretation is clear.
However, the classical linear regression model assumes that the relationships
between a dependent variable and several independent variables are linear.
For example, consider the case that we are predicting customer value with a
linear regression model:
</p>
<p>Customer Value(i) = Yi =
K&sum;
</p>
<p>k=1
</p>
<p>βkXik + εi (11.6)
</p>
<p>This linear regression assumes that the relationship between the customer
value (Yi) and the independent variables (Xik) is linear. However, in many
applications the straight-line assumption does not approximate the true re-
lationship very well. For example, customer value will be minimal for small
values of marketing contact (one of the X&rsquo;s), but once marketing expenditure
passes a certain point, customer value increases dramatically. This is called</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>300 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>a threshold effect. Or customer value increases rapidly at first with increased
marketing investment, but then levels off. This is called a saturation effect.
</p>
<p>However, the linearity assumption in classical linear regression is not as
narrow as it might first appear. In the regression context, linearity refers to
the manner in which the parameters and the disturbance enter the equation,
not necessarily to the relationship between variables (Greene 1997). Specifi-
cally, we are able to write the linear regression model in a very general form.
Let X = {x1, x2, . . . , xk} be a set of K independent variables and let f1,
f2, . . . , fM be M independent functions. And let g(Y ) be a function of Y .
Then the linear regression model is:
</p>
<p>g(Y ) = β1f1(Z) + β2f2(Z) + . . . . . + βMfM (Z) + ε
= β1x1 + β2x2 + . . . . . + βMxm + ε
</p>
<p>(11.7)
</p>
<p>Hence, the original linear regression can be tailored to various modeling situa-
tions by using logarithms, exponentials, reciprocals, transcendental functions,
polynomials, products, ratios, and so on for f(&bull;) or g(&bull;). For example, the
relationship between X and Y might be hypothesized as:
</p>
<p>Y = Xβ11 X
β2
2 . . . X
</p>
<p>βK
K e
</p>
<p>ε =
&prod;K
</p>
<p>k=1
Xβkk e
</p>
<p>ε (11.8a)
</p>
<p>In logs,
</p>
<p>lnY = β1 lnX1+β2 lnX2+&middot; &middot; &middot;+βK lnXK+ε =
&sum;K
</p>
<p>k=1
βk lnXk+ε (11.8b)
</p>
<p>This model is known as a multiplicative model or log-linear model, where
f(&bull;) = g(&bull;) = ln(&bull;). It is also known as the constant elasticity model since
the elasticity of Y with respect to changes in Xk does not vary with Xk
(note: ηk = &part; lnY/&part; lnXk = βk). This model has been widely used for various
marketing problems. We can estimate parameters of Equation 11.8 using a
standard least squares procedure since its functional form belongs to the class
of Equation 11.7.
</p>
<p>Another popular model among marketers is an exponential model in which
the relationship between X and Y is hypothesized as:
</p>
<p>Y = eβ1X1+β2X2+βKXK+ε = e
&sum;K
</p>
<p>k=1 βkXk+ε (11.9a)
</p>
<p>In logs,
</p>
<p>lnY = β1X1 + β2X2 + &middot; &middot; &middot;+ βKXK + ε =
&sum;K
</p>
<p>k=1
βkXk + ε (11.9b)
</p>
<p>Here we just apply the transformation g(y) = ln(y). This model is also known
as a semi-log model in which the relationship between Y and X is not linear
(but ln Y andX is linear). Again we can estimate parameters of Equation 11.9
using a standard least squares procedure since its functional form belongs to
the class of Equation 11.7.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.3 Treatment of Missing Variables 301
</p>
<p>Another useful model is the Box-Cox model that embodies many models as
special cases. Suppose we consider a form of the linear model Y = α+βg(x)+ε
in which g(x) is defined as:
</p>
<p>g(λ)(x) =
</p>
<p>{
(xλ &minus; 1)/λ if λ �= 0
ln(x) if λ = 0
</p>
<p>(11.10)
</p>
<p>The linear model results if λ equals 1, whereas a log-linear or semi-log model
(depending on how Y is measured) results if λ equals 0. If λ equals &minus;1, then
the equation will involve the reciprocal of x. That is, depending on the value
of λ, we can explain various forms of relationship between Y and X. If λ is
known, we simply transform x into g(x) by inserting λ into Equation 11.9.
But λ typically is unknown a priori. So we may try different values of λ&rsquo;s
(e.g., &minus;1, 0, 1) and compare the performance of models with different λ&rsquo;s.
Alternatively, we can treat λ as an additional unknown parameter in the
model that will provide us with a tremendous amount of flexibility. The cost
of doing so is that the model becomes non-linear in its parameters. That is,
the model does not belong to the class in Equation 11.7 so that we cannot
use ordinary least square for its estimation. We would have to use nonlinear
regression (available in SAS).
</p>
<p>Finally, if we are ready to sacrifice the simplicity of the classical linear
regression, we can employ nonparametric regression in which no a priori re-
lationship is assumed. Simply assuming the relationship is smooth, nonpara-
metric regression overcomes the highly restrictive structure of linear model
and flexibly determines the shape of the relationship. It is data-driven method
and, in result, its estimation is computationally intensive. However, because
of the recent explosion in the size and speed of computers, several nonpara-
metric procedures can be run on personal computers. For more on nonpara-
metric regression, see Härdle and Turlach (1992), and Hastie and Tibshirani
(1990).
</p>
<p>11.3 Treatment of Missing Variables
</p>
<p>Missing variables is a fact of life for DBM applications. For example, de-
mographics such as income and marital status are often missing because
customers do not wish to divulge this information. Previous marketing ef-
forts may be available for some customers but not for others. The question
is how to handle this situation. One extreme solution is to eliminate a vari-
able from the analysis if it is missing for any customer. This is obviously
wasteful. For example, income could be an important predictor. There would
appear to be a huge opportunity cost for omitting this variable from the
analysis just because it is missing for say 20% of customers. The follow-
ing are methods that have been proposed and used for dealing with missing
data.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>302 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>11.3.1 Casewise Deletion
</p>
<p>In casewise deletion, the observation is discarded if any one of the variables
in the observation is missing. This method is simple but is not desirable if
the entire sample size is small. It is especially undesirable when each record
has a lot of variables and, hence, there is a high probability that at least
one variable is missing. In addition, casewise deletion may lead to the biased
results if the characteristics of the discarded records are different from those
of the remaining records.
</p>
<p>11.3.2 Pairwise Deletion
</p>
<p>Pairwise deletion can be used as an alternative to casewise deletion in sit-
uations where different samples can be used for different calculations. For
example, consider a case of calculating pairwise correlations. The correlation
between variable 1 and 2 is calculated across the remaining observations after
deleting observations in which variable 1 and/or 2 are missing. And the cor-
relation between variable 1 and 3 is based on the observations after deleting
observations in which variable 1 and/or 3 are missing. Each pairwise corre-
lation is computed over different sets of observations. For example, several
SAS procedures (in default) employ pairwise deletion. &ldquo;PROC CORR&rdquo; in
SAS estimates a correlation by using all cases with non-missing values for
the pair of variables.
</p>
<p>This procedure is also not appropriate when the sample size is small.
Moreover, if there is a systematic pattern in generating missing data, the
correlation coefficient matrix may be seriously biased because each pairwise
correlation is calculated over different subsets of cases.
</p>
<p>11.3.3 Single Imputation
</p>
<p>In single imputation, one substitutes a single value for each missing value.
Once all missing values are substituted, standard statistical procedures are
applied to the filled-in complete data set. The simplest form of the single
imputation is &ldquo;mean substitution&rdquo;, in which all missing values of a variable
are replaced by the mean value for that variable (computed across observed
values). Or the patterns in the complete (non-missing) data can be used
to impute a suitable value for the missing response. For example, house-
hold income may be related to the value of the car owned and the value
of the house owned. Hence, one estimates a regression model with house-
hold income as a dependent variable and the value of the car owned and the
value of the house owned as two independent variables. The missing values</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.3 Treatment of Missing Variables 303
</p>
<p>for the household income can be predicted (&ldquo;imputed&rdquo;) by the estimated
regression.
</p>
<p>A particular challenge in single imputation is when the analyst has avail-
able a variable at the aggregate level, but that variable is missing at the
household level. Consider the case where the analyst has mean income for
the census tract where the customer resides. It is common to use that mean
income as the income value for that customer. However, Duan et al. (2007)
show this leads to biased estimates of the income parameter in a predictive
model if income is correlated with a variable observed at the individual level,
e.g., age. Duan et al. then prescribe a Bayesian procedure for inferring an
individual-level estimate of the income variable. The procedure relies on a
survey or other source of data that contains individual-specific values of both
age and income.
</p>
<p>The most critical problem of the single imputation is that it ignores the
uncertainty on the predictions of the unknown missing values. As a result, the
variability in the variable for which observations are missing is misleadingly
decreased in direct proportion to the number of missing data points.
</p>
<p>11.3.4 Multiple Imputation
</p>
<p>Multiple imputation is an advanced method of dealing with missing data
that can solve the &ldquo;over-certainty&rdquo; problem of the single imputation method.
Rather than replacing a single value for each missing data point, multiple im-
putation imputes multiple values. For example, we introduced the regression-
based single imputation in which each missing value for the household income
is predicted by the estimated regression. But we know that the predicted value
is distributed as normal. In single imputation, we replace the missing value
by the expected value of this normal distribution. In multiple imputation,
we can impute the missing value several times by drawing from this normal
distribution.
</p>
<p>Statisticians have developed a general multiple imputation procedure that
replaces each missing value by a set of plausible values to incorporate the un-
certainty involved in imputing the missing value (Rubin 1987; Schafer 1997).
The procedure consists of three steps. First, the missing data are generated
m times, resulting in m sets of complete data. Second, each of the m complete
data sets is analyzed using the predictive modeling technique being employed
for this application. Finally, these intermediate results from the m complete
data sets are combined to generate a final model.
</p>
<p>There are several ways to implement the multiple imputation procedure.
The choice depends on the type of missing data patterns. For monotone
missing data patterns, either a regression method or propensity score method
can be used. The data set is said to have monotone missing data pattern
when a variable Xj is missing for the customer i implies that all subsequent</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>304 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>variables Xk(k &gt; j) are all missing for the customer i. For an arbitrary
missing data pattern, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used
(Schafer 1997). We will discuss MCMC method since missing data patterns
in database marketing are more likely to be arbitrary.
</p>
<p>Let X be the n&times; p matrix of complete data, which is not fully observed.
Let the observed part of X be Xobs and the missing part by Xmis. Schafer&rsquo;s
imputation method uses a Bayesian approach, in which information about
unknown parameters is expressed in the form of a posterior probability dis-
tribution. MCMC has been applied as a method for deriving posterior distrib-
utions in Bayesian inference. In addition, we need to assume the data model
or a probability model for the complete data. Multivariate normal models
are usually used for normally distributed data while a log-linear model is
assumed for categorical data. Without loss of generality, we assume that the
complete data are from a multivariate normal distribution with the unknown
parameters θ (i.e., mean vector and variance&ndash;covariance matrix). Our goal
is to derive the joint posterior distribution of Xmis and θ given Xobs that
is h(Xmis, θ|Xobs). For multiple imputations for missing data, the following
two steps are repeated.
</p>
<p>1. The Imputation Step: Generate Xmis from f(Xmis|Xobs, θ). That is, given
the estimated mean vector and variance&ndash;covariance matrix of the multi-
variate normal distribution (θ), the imputation step generates the missing
values (Xmis) from a conditional distribution f .
</p>
<p>2. The Posterior Step: Generate θ from g(θ|Xmis, Xobs). The posterior step
generates the posterior parameters (mean vector and variance&ndash;covariance
matrix) for the multivariate normal distribution from a conditional distri-
bution g. These new estimates will then be used in the imputation step.
</p>
<p>The two steps are iterated long enough for the iterated values to converge to
their stationary distribution. That is, at the tth iteration, the imputation
step generates X(t+1)mis given θ
</p>
<p>(t) and the posterior step generates θ(t+1)
</p>
<p>given X(t+1)mis . As a result, we have a Markov chain {X(1)mis, θ(1)}, {X(2)mis, θ(2)},
{X(3)mis, θ(3)} . . . which converges to h(Xmis, θ|Xobs). In practice, 50 to 100
burn-in iterations are used to make the iterations converge to the station-
ary joint distribution before imputing missing values. Then a set of missing
values are independently generated m times from this joint distribution.
</p>
<p>When the imputation step is finished, each of the m complete data sets is
in turn analyzed with the predictive model. This yields m different sets of the
point and the variance estimates for the predictive model parameters. Let Q̂i
be the point estimate from the ith imputed data set and Ûi be the correspond-
ing variance estimate. That is, we have {Q̂1, Û1}, {Q̂2, Û2}, . . . , {Q̂m, Ûm}
from m applications of the predictive model. Then the point estimate for
Q from m complete data sets is the average of the point estimates from m
different data sets.
</p>
<p>Q̄ =
m&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>Q̂i/m (11.10a)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.3 Treatment of Missing Variables 305
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the variance estimate for Q̄ should consider the between-
imputation variance as well as the within-imputation variance.
</p>
<p>V ar(Q̄) = Ū + (1 + 1/m)B (11.10b)
</p>
<p>Ū =
m&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>Ūi/m (within-imputation variance)
</p>
<p>B =
m&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>(Q̂i &minus; Q̄)2/(m&minus; 1)(between-imputation variance)
</p>
<p>The total variance V ar(Q̄) is the weighted average of the within-imputation
variance and the between-imputation variance. The within-imputation vari-
ance Ū is simply the average of the variance estimates from m different data
sets. The between-imputation variance B is the key term which explains the
uncertainty associated with missing values. Since single imputation does not
consider this between-imputation variance for missing values, its variance
estimates become underestimated.
</p>
<p>Multiple imputation is becoming more popular in treating missing
values among database marketers because of its theoretical attractiveness
and the availability of commercial software. For example, SAS has a
procedure PROC MI that can implement multiple imputations for an
n &times; p matrix of incomplete data. Once the m complete data are gener-
ated and analyzed by using the predictive model of our choice, PROC
MIANALYZE can be used to generate valid statistical inference (e.g., Equa-
tion 11.10) by combining results from the m applications of the predictive
model.
</p>
<p>11.3.5 Data Fusion
</p>
<p>Kamakura and Wedel (1997) introduced a special type of missing data
problem called data fusion. Figure 11.1 shows the structure of data set for
data fusion. A marketing researcher conducts a survey and then attempts
to relate its results to another survey conducted with a different sample
of respondents. We conduct a survey to respondents in sample A to col-
lect variables I and II, and conduct another survey to respondents in sam-
ple B to collect variable II and III. Combining these two survey responses,
we have missing observations of variable III for sample A respondents and
variable I for sample B respondents. The variables common to sample A
and B can be demographic variables, whereas the variables unique to sam-
ple A or sample B can be brand choice behavior and media exposure,
respectively.
</p>
<p>It is not practical to apply the multiple imputation procedure to this type
of data since there are too many missing variables to be imputed. Statisticians
have traditionally developed a special technique called a file concatenation</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>306 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.1 Data structure for the data fusion problem (Modified from Kamakura and
Wedel 1997).
</p>
<p>method which is designed to combine data from two different sources. In a
file concatenation approach, when a variable is missing from sample A (the
recipient sample), its value is taken from sample B (the donor sample) to
replace it (Ford 1983; Roberts 1994). Each recipient customer in sample A is
linked to one or more donor customers in sample B on the basis of common
variables. Similarity or distance between customers is measured in terms of
common variables (e.g., demographic variables).
</p>
<p>Kamakura and Wedel&rsquo;s data fusion method is different from previous file
concatenation methods in several aspects. First, they assume the existence
of a set of unobserved imputation groups in the combined sample of A and
B. If some variables in sample A are missing, they can be replaced by values
that are derived from the (mixture) model estimates obtained from customers
from sample B belonging to that same latent imputation group. The funda-
mental idea is similar to the previous file concatenation methods. However,
Kamakura and Wedel identify (latent) homogeneous groups based on sta-
tistical estimation, whereas the previous file concatenation methods identify
similar customers in rather heuristic ways. Second, their procedure is spe-
cially tailored to discrete data and the problem of forming cross-classified
tables with chi-square tests of significance among variables from independent
studies obtained from separate samples. Third, previous methods concatenate
two independent files by matching them on the basis of the information on
the common variables (e.g., variable II in Fig. 11.1) only. In contrast, data fu-
sion uses a mixture model that identifies homogeneous imputation groups on
the basis of all information available from the two samples. Finally, their data
fusion method overcomes problems of model selection encountered in previ-
ous approaches to modeling under missing data. Data fusion uses multiple</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.3 Treatment of Missing Variables 307
</p>
<p>imputations to provide an assessment of the uncertainty caused by the data-
fusion process.
</p>
<p>As mentioned, there are several ways to implement multiple imputation
procedures. The choice depends on the type of missing data patterns. Data
fusion is a special type of multiple imputation technique designed to com-
bine data from multiple sources. Hence, the multiple imputation method in
previous section may be appropriate for general missing variable problems
encountered by database marketers. However, when database marketers at-
tempt to combine customer data from various sources, data fusion can be a
very efficient method.
</p>
<p>11.3.6 Missing Variable Dummies
</p>
<p>Another simple approach to treat missing variables is to create a missing
variable dummy per covariate to signify that the variable is missing for a given
customer (Van den Poel and Larivière 2003). The extra dummy takes on the
value of 1 or 0 depending on whether a variable for a particular customer
is missing or complete. For example, suppose that one of the independent
variables is INCOME that contains some missing values. We define:
</p>
<p>INCOMEM i = 1 if income is missing for customer i, and 0 if not missing
INCOMEO i = customer i&rsquo;s income if income is not missing, and 0 if missing
Yi = dependent variable to be predicted for customer i, e.g., customer value
</p>
<p>The model is then Yi = β0 + β1INCOMEM i + β2INCOMEO i + εi. After
estimation, we would have the following predictions:
</p>
<p>Ŷi = β̂0 + β̂1 if income is missing for customeri (11.11a)
</p>
<p>Ŷi = β̂0 + β̂2INCOMEOi if income is not missing for customer i.
(11.11b)
</p>
<p>This method allows us to learn about the relationship between income
and customer value among the customers for whom we have such infor-
mation. That relationship is quantified by β̂2. We also learn whether the
fact that the customer has missing income data provides any insight on cus-
tomer value. That insight is quantified by β̂1. For example, we might find
β̂1 &gt; 0 if wealthy people are reluctant to divulge their income. In sum-
mary, this method allows us to learn about the relationship between the
missing variable and the dependent variable of interest, while at the same
time providing information on the types of people for whom information is
missing.
</p>
<p>Missing variable dummies can actually be used after we impute missing
observations from single or multiple imputations. The extra dummy takes
on the value of 1 if the observation is imputed (previously missing) and 0 if</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>308 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>the observation is complete. For example, we apply the above regression with
two income variables: INCOMEM i = 1 if income is imputed for customer
i, and 0 if complete; INCOMEO i = customer i&rsquo;s income if income is not
imputed, and customer i&rsquo;s imputed income if missing. If missing values occur
randomly and our imputation procedure is unbiased, the coefficient associated
with INCOMEM will be estimated to be 0. If this coefficient is not zero
and statistically significant, we conclude that our imputing method does not
capture the pattern of missing data generation process appropriately.
</p>
<p>11.4 Evaluation of Statistical Models
</p>
<p>We often come up with several alternative models in a database market-
ing application. We then need to determine which one to use. This is the
subject of model selection in statistics. In a typical database marketing
application, we randomly partition the data into two mutually exclusive
subsets, the estimation sample and the holdout (or test) sample. We esti-
mate competing models on the estimation (also called calibration) sample,
and test their predictive performance on the holdout (also called validation)
sample.
</p>
<p>The major drawback in comparing models in the estimation sample has
been found to be the problem of overfitting (i.e., finding statistical para-
meters that predict idiosyncratic characteristics of the calibration data that
do not hold up in the real world). For example, the estimation of classical
regression model is designed to minimize its mean squared error (or sum
of squared errors). As a result, a complex model is guaranteed to have
a lower mean squared error (or higher R2) than a simpler model. Tak-
ing an extreme case, using a polynomial of sufficiently high order, we can
develop a regression model with zero mean squared error. However, this
complex model may overfit the data by identifying random fluctuations as
true patterns in the data. As mentioned in the section of all-possible sub-
set regression, to overcome the problem of overfitting, statisticians have de-
veloped evaluation criteria such as adjusted R2, AIC and BIC for model
selection in the calibration sample. You select the model with the high-
est adjusted R2 or the lowest AIC or BIC. Basically, these criteria avoid
the problem of overfitting by panelizing the number of parameters to be
estimated.
</p>
<p>Even though model selection in the calibration sample has been widely
studied in the statistical literature, database marketers rarely evaluate al-
ternative models in the calibration sample. Hence, we limit our attention to
model selection problems based on the validation sample. We first discuss
various methods to divide the sample into calibration and validation sam-
ples, and then study evaluation criteria to compare alterative models in the
validation sample.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.4 Evaluation of Statistical Models 309
</p>
<p>11.4.1 Dividing the Sample into the Calibration and
Validation Sample
</p>
<p>How much of the data should be saved for the validation sample? The larger
the calibration sample, the more accurate the model (hence, lower standard
errors for the parameter estimates), although the returns would begin to
diminish once the size of calibration data exceeds to a certain limit. And the
larger the validation sample, the more discerning is the comparison between
alternative models. There is a tradeoff.
</p>
<p>11.4.1.1 The Holdout Method
</p>
<p>The holdout method randomly partitions the data into two mutually exclu-
sive subsets, the calibration sample and the validation (or holdout) sample.
Models are estimated with the calibration sample and the prediction errors
of the estimated models are compared using the validation sample.
</p>
<p>The first important issue in the holdout method is what percentage of the
data should be used for the calibration sample. More data in the calibration
sample leads to more efficient estimates, while more in the validation sample
leads to a more powerful validity test. That is, as more data are used for
the calibration sample (so less data for the holdout sample), the model pa-
rameter estimates become more accurately estimated but the variance of the
prediction errors for each competing model becomes larger. Alternatively, if
you decrease the size of the calibration sample, the variance of the prediction
errors becomes smaller but the parameter estimates become inaccurate.
</p>
<p>In many database marketing applications, it is common to reserve one-
third of the data for the holdout sample and use the remaining two-third
for the estimation (Kohavi 1995). Steckel and Vanhonacker (1993) showed
that the proportion of the sample optimally devoted to validation increases,
levels off, and then decreases as the total sample size increases. Specifically,
in small samples (e.g., n &lt; 100), the one-quarter to one-third validation split
was recommended. However, once the sample size gets larger, any reasonable
split performed equally well. Hence, we may not need to worry about the
optimal split between estimation and validation sample since the sample sizes
in real database marketing applications are very large.4
</p>
<p>A second issue in creating the calibration and holdout samples is the risk
that the resulting calibration or holdout sample may not be representative
despite the random partitioning. The overrepresented class in the calibra-
tion sample will be underrepresented in the holdout sample. For an example
of credit scoring, suppose that the data have 50% of defaults and 50% of
</p>
<p>4 All the results from Steckel and Vanhonaker (1993) were based on a regression model
containing two independent variables, which is a rather restrictive specification. Hence,
more research may be required to generalize their results.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>310 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>non-defaults. If the calibration sample happens to have more than 50% of
defaults, then the percentage of defaults in the holdout sample will be less
than 50%.
</p>
<p>There are two ways of addressing this problem (Witten and Frank 2000).
One is to employ stratification in partitioning the data. For the discrete de-
pendent variable, a data is partitioned such that both the calibration and
the holdout sample have the same proportion of each class. For the con-
tinuous dependent variable, the data are ranked in ascending order and is
partitioned such that observations are evenly represented in both samples.
An alternative way is to do random sub-sampling where the holdout method
is repeated k times and the prediction error is derived by averaging the pre-
diction errors from different iterations. Even though it is time consuming,
random sub-sampling is a better way of minimizing the problem of sample
misrepresentation.
</p>
<p>A third issue is that selecting the best model from a single experiment (or
partitioning) may be too näıve. The estimates of prediction errors are random
variables so that they are expected to show random variations. Hence, in
order to compare the true performances of alternative models, we require a
set of prediction error estimates from multiple experiments. More specifically,
we randomly divide our data into the calibration and the validation sample.
Estimate two alternative models using the calibration sample, and derive the
prediction errors of two models applied to the validation sample, {x1, y1},
where x1 and y1 are the prediction error estimate of the first model and
the second model. We now repeat the procedure all over again. We divide
the data, estimate models, and derive another set of prediction errors. This
yields {x2, y2}. We repeat the same experiment k times resulting in k sets of
prediction error estimates. Considering these k sets of estimates as a paired
comparison data, we can design a formal statistical test for comparison, a
paired t-test. The test statistic is t = D̄/
</p>
<p>&radic;
σ2D/k where Di = xi&minus;yi, D̄ is the
</p>
<p>mean of Di, and σ2D is the variance of Di. Given your choice of significance
level, we reject or accept the null hypothesis that the performances of two
models are the same.5
</p>
<p>11.4.1.2 K-Fold Cross-Validation
</p>
<p>As implied, the holdout method makes inefficient use of the data by reserving
a large portion of the data for the validation sample. If the size of the data
</p>
<p>5 Once we find the best performing model, we are often interested in reporting its
</p>
<p>parameter estimates. Then we apply the best model to the entire sample and report
</p>
<p>its parameter estimates. This procedure is applied to the other calibration/validation
</p>
<p>methods such as k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out and the bootstrap. That is, the
goal of dividing the sample into the calibration and validation is to get accurate predic-
tion error estimates in an efficient way. So if we are interested in parameter estimates,
we do not need to divide the sample into two so that we can estimate the parameters
more accurately.</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>is really big, this is not a significant problem. However, the size of your data
in practice may often be smaller than you would like it to be. Database
marketers frequently adopt K-fold cross-validation technique to use the data
more efficiently.
</p>
<p>In K-fold cross-validation, the data is randomly divided into K equal
sized and mutually exclusive subsets (or folds). The model is estimated and
validated k times; each subset in turn is reserved for the validation and the
remaining data are used for estimation. The k prediction errors from different
iterations are averaged to provide the overall prediction error estimate.
</p>
<p>Similar to the holdout method, the problem of sample misrepresentation
problem in K-fold cross-validation can be mitigated by stratification and/or
repetition. If stratification is adopted to K-fold cross-validation, it is called
stratified k-fold cross-validation. Repeating k-fold cross-validation multiple
times using different partitions (or folds) and averaging the results will pro-
vide a better error estimate.
</p>
<p>How many folds should be used? Various tests on a number of datasets
have shown that ten is about the right number even though there are not any
strong theoretical explanations as to why (Witten and Frank 2000). Kohavi
(1995) has empirically shown that as k decreases (e.g., k = 2 and 5) and the
estimation sample sizes get smaller, there is a variance due to the instability
of the estimation sample, leading to an increase in variance. The k-fold cross-
validation with 10 to 20 folds produced the best performance.
</p>
<p>11.4.1.3 Leave-One-Out Method
</p>
<p>Leave-one-out cross-validation is simply a type of k-fold cross-validation when
k is equal to the size of the entire sample. Each observation in turn is re-
served for validation and the remaining (k &minus; 1) observations are used for
estimation. Upon estimation, the model is applied to the validation sam-
ple (consisted of one observation) and its prediction error is computed. The
overall estimate of prediction error is the average of k error estimates from k
iterations.
</p>
<p>Leave-one-out cross-validation is an attractive method in using the data
(Witten and Frank 2000). Since it uses a large amount of data for estimation,
parameters are estimated more accurately. It is shown to work especially well
when the dependent variable is continuous. However, it has not performed
well for discrete dependent variable or for model selection problem (Shao
1993).
</p>
<p>11.4.1.4 Bootstrap
</p>
<p>Given a dataset of size n, the principle of the bootstrap is to select samples of
size n with replacement from the original sample. Since the bootstrap samples</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>312 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>are selected with replacement, some cases are typically sampled more than
once. Originally introduced by Efron (1983), bootstrapping has been shown
to work better than other cross-validation techniques, especially in small
samples.
</p>
<p>There are various bootstrap methods that can be used for estimating pre-
diction error and confidence bounds (Efron and Tibshirani 1993). One of the
simplest is the 0.632 bootstrap in which a dataset of n observations is selected
(with replacement) from an original sample of size n. Since some cases are
sampled more than once, there are cases that are not picked. Those obser-
vations not included in the bootstrap sample are used as validation samples.
The probability of any given observation not being chosen in the original
sample is (1&minus; 1/n)n &asymp; e&minus;1 = 0.368. Therefore, the expected number of dis-
tinct observations from the original dataset appearing in the calibration set
is 63.2% of the sample size n. Accordingly, we expect that the size of the val-
idation set will be 36.8% of the original sample size n for a reasonably large
dataset. The 0.632 bootstrap has been improved to the popular 0.632+ boot-
strap that performs very well for estimating prediction error with discrete
dependent variables (Efron and Tibshirani 1993).
</p>
<p>The estimate of prediction error for 0.632 bootstrap is derived by com-
bining the error from the validation sample and the error from the cal-
ibration sample. Since the model is estimated on the sample containing
only 63.2% of distinct cases, the prediction error applied to the valida-
tion sample may overestimate the true prediction error. On the other hand,
the error in the calibration sample underestimate the true prediction er-
ror. Hence, the estimate is given by the linear combination of these two
errors, given by 0.632 &times; (prediction error in validation sample) plus 0.368 &times;
(error in calibration sample). Given a bootstrap sample, prediction er-
rors for alternative models are calculated and compared to find the best
model.
</p>
<p>11.4.2 Evaluation Criteria
</p>
<p>Here we describe several evaluation criteria frequently employed by data-
base marketers to choose the best model. Several alternative measures are
available to evaluate the performance of the model applied to the validation
sample. All of them measure &ldquo;goodness-of-fit&rdquo;, which refers to how well the
model can predict the dependent variable. In other words, these measures
all assess the distance between what really happened and what the model
predicts to happen. But they differ in ways of quantifying the distance. De-
pending on the purpose of models, one criterion is preferred to another. There
is no dominating criterion. Database marketers employ different performance
measures depending on the nature of dependent variables. We first discuss
various measures when the dependent variable is continuous (sales, market</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.4 Evaluation of Statistical Models 313
</p>
<p>share, monthly shopping expenditure, etc.). Next we discuss discrete depen-
dent variables (churn, response, etc.).
</p>
<p>11.4.2.1 Continuous Dependent Variable
</p>
<p>Suppose we have n observations for the validation sample on which we want
to evaluate predictions. The actual values for the dependent variable are
Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn and the corresponding predicted values are Ŷ1, Ŷ2, . . . , Ŷn. If
the model predicts perfectly for the ith observation, Ŷi should be the same
as Yi. There is no error. The distance between Ŷi and Yi indicates a pre-
diction error. Table 11.2 summarizes the formulae of alternative performance
measures frequently used for the continuous dependent variable. They are
different in terms of defining this distance.
</p>
<p>Mean squared error may be the most popular measure among statisti-
cians partially because of its mathematical tractability. It is easier to make a
statistical inference on the summation of the squared terms. An alternative
measure is mean absolute error that measures the Euclidean distance be-
tween the predicted and the actual value. Mean squared error panelizes the
larger errors more heavily by squaring them while mean absolue error treats
all errors evenly. Hence, if your application accepts marginal prediction er-
rors but tries to avoid large errors, you should employ mean squared error as
the evaluation measure. On the other hand, note that mean absolute error is
more robust to outliers than mean squared error.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>314 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>Sometimes it is more relevant to use a relative performance measure. Both
mean squared error and mean absolute error are unit dependent. For exam-
ple, we can increase or decrease mean squared error simply by multiplying our
data by an arbitrary number (that is not zero). We cannot tell how good a
model with mean squared error of 100 is. Relative squared error makes mean
square error unit-free by normalization. Similar to R2 in linear regression,
total sum of squares is used for the normalizing factor. Similarly, relative ab-
solute error normalizes mean absolute error. Mean absolute percentage error
can also be interpreted as a kind of relative measure since it has normalization
factor (actual value in the denominator) applied to each observation.
</p>
<p>There is no dominant performance measure. As shown in the comparison
between mean squared error and mean absolute error, each measure has its
advantages and limitations. The choice will be determined after studying
the research problem itself. For example, the cost associated with prediction
errors helps us to select a prediction measure. But cost information is not
always available. Hence, researchers report a number of measures to evaluate
their model performance. Fortunately, a number of studies have shown that
correlations among performance measures are strongly positive. We may not
need to worry about much the selection among performance measures.
</p>
<p>11.4.2.2 Discrete Dependent Variable
</p>
<p>Hit Ratio
</p>
<p>Different performance measures have been proposed when the dependent vari-
able is discrete. We first describe two popular measures, the hit ratio and pre-
dictive log-likelihood, when the dependent variable takes on values of either
0 or 1. These measures can easily be generalized for the dependent variables
with more than two discrete values. For a discrete dependent variable, the
predictive value typically takes the form of probabilities. For example, sup-
pose a bank wants to know who is going to default. Historical data includes
both defaulters (coded 1) and no defaulters (coded 0) with their demographic
characteristics. Upon estimation the model (e.g., logit) is applied to the test
sample with n customers. With customer specific demographic information,
the model provides the predictive default probability of each customer. If the
probability is greater than a cut-off threshold 0.5, then we predict that she
will default. Otherwise, she is predicted not to default. Hit ratio is calculated
as
</p>
<p>Hit ratio =
n&sum;
</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>Hi/n (11.12)
</p>
<p>where Hi is 1 if the prediction is correct and 0 if the prediction is wrong.
That is, hit ratio is the percentage of correct predictions.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.4 Evaluation of Statistical Models 315
</p>
<p>One may ask why we use the cut-off of 0.5 for the hit ratio. The answer
is that if the prediction is higher than 0.5, the event is more likely to occur
than not occur, and so we predict that it occurs. However, this is somewhat
arbitrary and we will generalize this notion of hit rate, across all thresholds,
when we discuss ROC curves.
</p>
<p>Predicted Log-Likelihood
</p>
<p>Hit ratio employs a 0/1 loss function. The loss is 0 if the prediction is correct
and 1 if it is not. This loss function is intuitive and easy to understand.
However, the hit ratio is a lexicographic type of measure. It treats the case
with the predicted probability of 0.51 to be the same as the case with 0.99
when the customer actually defaults. It ignores the distance between the
actual and the predicted once it passes the threshold (i.e., 0.5). Adopting a
loss function with continuous form, the predictive log-likelihood overcomes
the problem associated with the lexicographic loss function of the hit ratio.
The predicted likelihood of observing the data can be expressed as:
</p>
<p>Predicted Likelihood =
n&prod;
</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>[
P̂Yii &times; (1&minus; P̂ )(1&minus;Yi)i
</p>
<p>]
(11.13a)
</p>
<p>Taking logs of this equation, the formula for the predictive log-likelihood is
</p>
<p>Predictive log-likelihood =
n&sum;
</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>[
Yi log P̂i + (1&minus; Yi) log(1&minus; P̂i)
</p>
<p>]
(11.13b)
</p>
<p>where P̂i is the predicted probability of default, and Yi represents the ac-
tual default value taking 1 if customer defaults, 0 otherwise. The larger the
log-likelihood, the better the model. The perfect model in which the model
predicts 0 when the actual is 0 and 1 when the actual is 1 will have the log-
likelihood of zero. Imperfect models will have negative log-likelihoods; the
more negative the value, the worse the prediction.
</p>
<p>ROC Sensitivity
</p>
<p>The concept of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve originated
in the field of signal detection to measure the diagnostic power of a model
(Swets 1988). In order to understand its concept, let us take a look at a two-
by-two contingency table shown in Table 11.3. A diagnostic system (or model)
looks for a particular &ldquo;signal&rdquo; and ignores other events called &ldquo;noise.&rdquo; The
event is considered to be &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative,&rdquo; and the diagnosis made is
correspondingly positive or negative. For example, there are customers who
will respond to the mailing offer (&ldquo;positive&rdquo;) and who will not (&ldquo;negative&rdquo;).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>316 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>Table 11.3 True event versus diagnosis (From Swets 1988)
</p>
<p>Event
</p>
<p>Positive Negative
</p>
<p>Diagnosis Positive True positive (a) False positive (b) a+ b
Negative False negative (c) True negative (d) c+ d
</p>
<p>a+ c b+ d a+ b+ c+
d&minus;N
</p>
<p>And using the predictive model we estimate customers&rsquo; response probabilities,
and assign them into responders or non-responders. There are two ways in
which the actual event and the diagnosis can agree: &ldquo;true-positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;true-
negative&rdquo; in Table 11.3. And there are two cases that diagnosis can be wrong:
&ldquo;false-positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;false-negative.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In a test of a diagnostic model, the true-positive proportion, a/(a + c),
and the false-positive proportion, b/(b + d), can capture all of the relevant
information on accuracy of the model. These two proportions are often called
the proportion of &ldquo;hits&rdquo; and &ldquo;false alarms.&rdquo; The true positive proportion is
also called &lsquo;sensitivity&rsquo; that is the probability of a randomly selected positive
event being evaluated as positive by the model. In addition, the true negative
proportion is often called specificity that is the probability of a randomly
selected negative event being evaluated as negative by the model. Note that
the false positive proportion is (1 &ndash; specificity). A good diagnostic model will
provide many hits with few false alarms.
</p>
<p>The ROC curve plots the proportion of hits versus false alarms for various
settings of the decision criterion (see Fig. 11.2). Going back to the credit
assessment example, we derived hit ratio based on the decision that if the
predicted default probability of a customer is greater than a threshold value
(e.g., 0.5), then we predict that she will default. Otherwise, she is predicted
not to default. In an ROC curve, we initially set the threshold value high,
say 0.9. We do not issue a credit card to a customer if her predicted default
probability is higher than 0.9. We issue a credit card otherwise. Given the
threshold, we can prepare the two-by-two contingency table. The proportions
of hits and false alarms from the table will become a point of the ROC curve
for the model. Now we set the threshold value a bit lower, say 0.8. And plot
a point of the ROC curve. Changing the value of the threshold value to 0 will
complete the ROC curve.
</p>
<p>Note an ROC curve is generated for a particular model as a function of
a critical decision criterion or parameter in the model, the cut-off threshold.
The performance (or value) of the model is measured to be the area under
the ROC curve. The area varies from 0.5 to 1. The major diagonal in Fig. 11.2
represents the case of the area equal to 0.5 when the proportions of hits and
false alarms are the same. Random assignment will lead to the area of 0.5.
On the other hand, a perfect model when the curve follows the left and upper
axes has the area of 1. There are no false alarms with 100% hits. The realistic</p>

<p>Fig. 11.2 The ROC curve&lowast;.
&lowast;&ldquo;A&rdquo; signifies the area under the ROC curve. The best model is the one that generates
ROC curves with highest area (From Swets 1988).
</p>
<p>model lies in between. The area under the curve increases as the model can
increase more hits while reducing the number of false alarms. We want to
select the model with the highest-area ROC curve, because this means that
for a given threshold cut-off, it generates more true-positives relative to false-
positives.
</p>
<p>11.4.2.3 Evaluation Criteria to Assess Financial Performance
</p>
<p>The evaluation criteria discussed so far measure the goodness-of-fit that refers
to how well the model can predict the dependent variable. However, these
evaluation criteria are not useful for assessing the financial performance of
the predictive models. Models that do not fit well can still perform well
(Malthouse 2002). There are several evaluation criteria to assess the financial
performance of the models.
</p>
<p>Lift (Gains) Chart
</p>
<p>Direct marketers frequently evaluate their proposed models using a gains ta-
ble (or chart) analysis. Gains table can be developed as follows (see Banslaben</p>

</p>
<p>(1992) and Chapter 10 more details). Once we estimate the response model,
the model is applied to each customer in the validation sample to derive the
corresponding response probability (P̂i). Then all customers in validation are
ordered by their predicted response probabilities. In the final step, customers
are sequentially divided in groups of equal size (usually ten groups), and
the average actual response rate per group is calculated. The gains table
describes the relationship between the ordered groups and the (cumulative)
average response rate in these groups. Table 11.4 shows an example of gains
table.
</p>
<p>The response rate of the top decile is usually used to evaluate the perfor-
mances of models. The response rate of the top decile in Table 11.4 is 6%,
which is much higher than the overall response rate of 1.6%. The best per-
forming model is the one which provides the highest response rate in the
top decile. Alternatively, the variation among the response rates in each of
10 deciles can be used to evaluate the performances of competing models
(Ratner 2002). The best model will show the greatest variation. That is, our
goal here is to maximize the separation between top deciles and the bottom
deciles.
</p>
<p>Lift is a useful measure that can be calculated directly from the gains
table, and also used to compare the performances among alternative models.
Formally, we can define lift as λk = rk/r̄ where λk is lift for the kth tile, rk
is response rate for the kth tile and r̄ is the average response rate across the
entire sample. In words, λk is how much more likely customers in kth tile are
to respond, compared to the average response rate for the entire sample. We
want lift in the top tiles to be greater than 1, and correspondingly, lift in the
lower tiles to be less than 1. For example, the average response rate across
the entire sample is 1.60% while the response rate in the top decile 6.00%.
Therefore, customers in the top decile are 3.75 times more likely to respond
than average (λk = 6.00/1.60 = 3.75). We say, top decile lift is 3.75. Lift
itself does not have direct managerial (or financial) significance. However,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11.4 Evaluation of Statistical Models 319
</p>
<p>the extent to which top tiles have higher lifts makes them more profitable,
since lift is directly proportional to response rate. In addition, it is easy to
compare lift across models or different applications. See more discussion in
Chapter 10.
</p>
<p>Another evaluation criteria frequently used in database marketing is the
cumulative lift chart, which tabulates cumulative response rates from the top
n-tile down. Continuing our example in Table 11.4, the cumulative lift for
the kth decile is defined by the percentage of all responders accounted for
by the first k deciles. For example, the top 3 deciles account for 75.0% of all
responders. Obviously, the higher the cumulative lift is for a given decile, the
better the model.
</p>
<p>Gini Coefficient
</p>
<p>The Gini coefficient is essentially the area between the model&rsquo;s cumulative
lift curve and the lift curve that would result from random prediction. It was
originally developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini. To understand
the general concept, we need to define the Lorenz curve and the perfect equal-
ity line. The Lorenz curve is a graph representing the cumulative distribution
function of a probability distribution. For example, it is frequently used to
represent income distribution of a country, where it shows for the top x%
of its population, what percentage (y%) of the total income they have. The
percentage of the population is plotted on the x-axis, and the percentage of
the total income on the y-axis. To draw the Lorenz curve, all the elements (or
customers) of a distribution must be ordered from the largest to the small-
est (in terms of their predicted response probabilies). Then, each element
(customer) is plotted according to its cumulative percentage of x and y. The
Lorenz curve is compared with the perfect equality line, which represents a
linear relationship between x and y. For example, if all the people in the pop-
ulation earn the same income, the Lorenz curve becomes the perfect equality
line.
</p>
<p>In database marketing applications, we would plot the percentage of cus-
tomers on the X-axis ordered by their predicted likelihood of responding, and
the cumulative percentage of responders (i.e., the cumulative lift curve) on
the Y-axis (see Fig. 11.3). The perfect equality line would represent a model
where predictions are made randomly, since then each customer would have
an equal chance of being predicted to be a responder. The higher this curve
relative to the perfect equality line, the better the model because our model
can account for a large percentage of the responders by targeting a relatively
small percentage of cutomers.
</p>
<p>The Gini coefficient is defined graphically as a ratio of the summation
of all vertical deviations between the Lorenz curve and the perfect equality
line (A) divided by the total area above the perfect inequality line (A + B).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>320 11 Statistical Issues in Predictive Modeling
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.3 Gini coefficient.
</p>
<p>That is, the Gini coefficient is equal to A/(A + B) in Fig. 11.3. Its value lies
between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to the perfect equality (i.e., everyone
has the same income) and 1 corresponds to the perfect inequality (i.e., one
person has all the income, while everyone else has zero income). In database
marketing terms, a Gini coefficient of 0 means that the model is predicting
no better than random, while a value of one corresponds to the (very rare
case) that there is only one responder and that customer is identified as the
customer with the highest probability of responding. In general, higher Gini
Coefficients mean that more responders can be identified by targeting smaller
numbers of customers.
</p>
<p>The Gini coefficient for a given model can be calcualted as:
</p>
<p>Gini coefficient =
N&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>(ci &minus; ĉi)/(1&minus; ĉi) (11.14)
</p>
<p>where ĉi is the proportion of the customers who have a predicted proba-
bility of response equal or greater than customer i&rsquo;s and ci is the propor-
tion of actual responders who are ranked equal or higher than customer
i in their response probability. That is, ĉi is the locus of the cumulative
lift curve and ci is the locus of the perfect equality line. We choose the
model with the highest Gini coefficient, that is, the Gini coefficient closest
to 1.</p>

<p>The scientific method for predicting the future is based on the assumption
that the future repeats the past. For many applications, this assumption is
reasonable. Suppose we try to predict monthly sales of color television. We
may build forecasting models, (whether they are time-series models or re-
gression models) based on historical sales of color television, and isolate pat-
terns from random variations. The predicted sales of a color TV are based
on the estimated model (or identified patterns). However, the future can be
very different from the past especially the market conditions are changing.
The model becomes useless. This is why we need to keep updating mod-
els. Sometimes it may be enough to re-estimate the model with additional
data. Sometimes we need to change the model itself. Remember that the
model cannot be static. (See discussion of model &ldquo;shelf life&rdquo; in Chapter 10
(Sect. 10.5.2).)</p>

<p>RFM Analysis
</p>
<p>Abstract Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary Value (M) are the
most popular database marketing metrics used to quantify customer trans-
action history. Recency is how recently the customer has purchases; frequency
is how often the customer purchases, and monetary value is the dollar value
of the purchases. RFM analysis classifies customers into groups according to
their RFM measures, and relates these classifications to behaviors such as the
likelihood of responding to a catalog or other offer. RFM analysis was prob-
ably the first &ldquo;predictive model&rdquo; used in database marketing. This chapter
discusses the RFM framework, how it can be used and various extensions.
</p>
<p>12.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>How do you select customers for target mailing? Or whom should you send
your catalogs or direct mail offers to? The need to mail smarter is always
among the top concerns of direct marketers. The direct mail promotion that
results in sales to 2% of the mailed universe is considered a success. Identifying
and targeting the customers who are most likely to respond are therefore of
prime concern.
</p>
<p>Because of the nature of their businesses, direct marketers including cat-
alogers have been collecting customer data, analyzing them, and developing
models for several decades to improve their business performance. One pop-
ular approach used to improve mailing efficiency is the RFM &ndash; Recency, Fre-
quency, Monetary amount &ndash; model. The primitive form of the RFM model
was used about 50 years ago by catalogers of general merchandise. For exam-
ple, as early as 1961, George Cullinan promoted the use and understanding of
RFM customer data analysis. Recognizing his contribution in advancing the
direct marketing industry, the DMA (Direct Marketing Association) inducted
him into the DMA Hall of Fame in 1989.
</p>
<p>The core concept of the RFM model is based on the empirical evidence.
Direct marketers have found that the response to a mailing offer is hetero-
geneous across customers. And they also found that customers who have

<p>324 12 RFM Analysis
</p>
<p>responded well in the past are likely to respond in the future. More specif-
ically, direct marketers have found that customers&rsquo; purchase response can
be predicted using their previous purchase histories. The three most impor-
tant variables to summarize customers&rsquo; purchase histories are recency (R),
frequency (F), and monetary amount (M). That is, using RFM measures
for each customer, one can predict his or her propensity to respond. Once
identifying who is going to respond, the direct marketer sends catalogs to
customers with high propensity.
</p>
<p>This chapter first discusses the fundamental concepts of the RFM model.
Second, using the notion of a breakeven point, we study how the model
can be used to determine the number of customers to mail to, in order to
maximize profits. In Sect. 12.2, highlighting the relationship of RFM model
with other statistical tools, we criticize its current status and investigate the
possibility of extending its potential. We conclude that while simple RFM
analysis may provide a good starting point, statistical model-building using
the raw customer data is the better option.
</p>
<p>12.2 The Basics of the RFM Model
</p>
<p>Suppose that a direct mail company has its house list with a million
customers. Each season it decides to mail catalogs to a subset of customers
from the house list. Sending catalogs to all customers will maximize its
revenue or sales. But it may lose profits if the average response rate is too
low. There are some customers who will not purchase the product whatever
the company does. The company would like to select good customers who
are likely to respond to the catalogs. The goal of an RFM analysis is to
predict the response (or purchase) probability of each customer. Sending
catalogs to only perhaps 20% of its customers based on these predictions
(the good customers), the company can now make a profit.
</p>
<p>12.2.1 Definition of Recency, Frequency, and
Monetary Value
</p>
<p>Based on their experience, direct marketers have found three important
purchase-related variables that will influence the future purchase possibility
of their customers. The first variable, recency (R), represents the last time the
customer purchased from the company. It stands for the elapsed time (mea-
sured in days, weeks, months or years) since the last purchase. For example,
suppose you randomly select 10,000 customers from a cataloger&rsquo;s house list.
Your objective is to find the relationship between the recency and the re-
sponse probability. You first choose a particular catalog mailing, say the June</p>

<p>catalog. You select 10,000 customers who received that mailing and record
whether or not they responded. Then, you measure how many months had
elapsed between receipt of the June catalog and the customer&rsquo;s previous pur-
chase. That is the measure of recency. We summarize the results in Fig. 12.1.
</p>
<p>Figure 12.1 shows that 350 of the 10,000 customers responded to the June
catalog by placing an order. So the average response rate is 3.5%. And the
decile analysis based on customers&rsquo; recency values indicates a negative rela-
tionship between the recency and the response rate. Those customers who
recently purchased from the company had the higher probability to purchase
again when they received the June catalog. Many direct marketers believe
that the negative relationship is a law. There may be various reasons why
the response rates are decreasing with recency (Gönül et al. 2000). The ini-
tial order might serve as a trigger to encourage the customer to think about
items that might complement that order. They thus place another soon after
the initial order. Or a first time buyer may order a second item because of
reduced uncertainty about the product and delivery quality with the arrival
of the initial order.
</p>
<p>However, the specific relationship between recency and purchase clearly
depends on various factors such as the types of product categories and cat-
aloger as well as catalog-specific factors. For example, Gönül et al. (2000)
found a U-shaped relationship applied to household semi-durable items. Cus-
tomers&rsquo; response rates initially decrease with recency because of the reasons
given above, but increase after a year or so because of an inventory effect.
That is, customers may need to replace the old product after a year. It is also
not hard to imagine a positive relationship between recency and purchase.
Consider the customer who has just obtained a new credit card from Capital
One. The customer probably would not be very receptive to an offer soon
after that for another credit card &ndash; the customer just obtained a new credit
card; why would he or she want another new one?
</p>
<p>Summarizing, the important point is that we frequently find that there is
some relationship between the recency and the response rate. It is most often
assumed to be negative but it might be U-shaped or positive. Once we learn</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>326 12 RFM Analysis
</p>
<p>the relationship, we can forecast response rate using recency calculated from
their historical purchase records. However, the exact shape of the relationship
is unknown to us before we look at the data.
</p>
<p>The second variable, frequency (F), represents how often the customer
has purchased in a certain time period (Bult and Wansbeek 1995). It is
often measured as the number of purchase occasions since the first purchase.
Some direct marketers use the number of purchase occasions divided by the
duration of being the customer. Similar to recency, the exact relationship
between the frequency and response rates should be determined empirically.
But the relationship is often positive. Those customers who frequently bought
the product tend to have higher probability to respond.
</p>
<p>Finally, response probabilities are related to monetary value (M) repre-
senting the dollar value of previous purchases. One might measure monetary
value as the amount of money spent during a certain time period (Bult and
Wansbeek 1995). Alternatively, one may use the total dollar amount divided
by the duration of being a customer, or simply the average expenditure per
order (Hughes 1996b). Similar to frequency, the monetary value tends to have
a positive relationship with the response probability.
</p>
<p>You can see that in the case of frequency and monetary value, these vari-
ables can become confounded with the length of the customer relationship if
not expressed on a per-period or per-order basis. However, the length of the
relationship is probably an important predictor of future behavior. Therefore,
perhaps an RFML model would be more appropriate, with recency, frequency
per period, monetary value per order, and length of relationship (e.g., time
since first purchase). However, in the real world, RFM is used, and either F
or M are not often expressed on per period or per order basis, so that at least
one of these variables also captures the length of the relationship.
</p>
<p>12.2.2 RFM for Segment-Level Prediction
</p>
<p>Once the information on customer purchase histories is summarized in the
three RFM variables, direct marketers construct a model to predict the re-
sponse propensity for each customer. Direct marketers transform the RFM
variables into discrete form in order to use them to predict response rates.
More specifically, three separate codes for each variable (RFM) are created.
For example, customers are sorted by their recency. A code of &ldquo;5&rdquo; is assigned
for the top 20% of customers in terms of their recency values. The next 20%
of customers are coded as &ldquo;4&rdquo;, and so on. As a result, every customer has a
recency code of 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1. That is, we transform the continuous vari-
able (recency) into five discrete variables (recency codes). As we will criticize
later, there is certainly information loss with this transformation. Similarly,
a frequency code and a monetary code are assigned to each customer. As a
result, each customer is now represented by three RFM codes.</p>

</p>
<p>The variable transformation from the original RFM to three RFM (dis-
crete) codes allows us to segment customers into 125 (5&times;5&times;5) groups. Every
customer is represented by his or her RFM codes and classified into the one
of the 125 groups. For example, suppose that a direct marketer randomly
selects 10,000 customers out of the house list who received a recent direct
mail offer. Responses to the offer are summarized in Table 12.1.1
</p>
<p>The results in Table 12.1 essentially are a cross-tabulation of R by F by M
by response, and become the RFM model for predicting a customer response
rate. That is, we model the response probability as a function of three RFM
codes. For example, if a customer has 5 for R, F, and M code, her response
probability is predicted to be 15%. Once the predicted response probabilities
are computed for all customers in the house list, one can select a group of
customers for an upcoming mailing drop.
</p>
<p>Reflecting the popularity of the RFM model, there are commercial pack-
ages available in the market to perform the above procedure in a fairly au-
tomatic way. Operated on a PC, they do everything necessary to code all
customers in terms of RFM, select test groups, and provide reports so that
the marketers can do the entire job themselves without any technical assis-
tance. For example, one can get a demo program for &ldquo;RFM for Windows&rdquo;
from http://www.dbmarketing.com.
</p>
<p>12.3 Breakeven Analysis: Determining the Cutoff Point
</p>
<p>If the number of direct mail offers to be sent has been dictated by budget con-
siderations, we can easily select customers in the house list by rank-ordering
</p>
<p>1 Note that we only have on average 10, 000/125 = 80 customers per segment. With this
small sample size, the segment-level response probabilities will be imprecisely estimated.
For example, if the estimated response probability is 3.5% for a certain segment, its 95%
confidence interval can be calculated to be (&minus;0.5%, 7.5%). In practice, more than 10,000
customers are often used to estimate the response probability of a single RFM segment.</p>
<p/>

<p>328 12 RFM Analysis
</p>
<p>them with respect to their predicted response probabilities. However, if we
are not provided with this constraint, we cannot determine the number of
customers to send direct mails by RFM model alone. We must determine the
optimal number of direct mail offers to maximize profit.
</p>
<p>12.3.1 Profit Maximizing Cutoff Response Probability
</p>
<p>With cost information, the profit-maximizing rule for the mailing decision
is rather simple. A firm should send the direct mail to a customer if the
expected profit from the customer is greater than zero. That is, we send the
direct mail if
</p>
<p>m&times; E(Z)&times; r̂ &minus; C &gt; 0 (12.1)
</p>
<p>where m represents profit contribution margin, E(Z) is the expected order
amount (given that the customer responds to the mailing offer), r̂ is the
predicted response probability from the RFM model, and C is the unit
mailing cost.
</p>
<p>The unit cost of mailing a catalog (C) is reasonably treated to be the same
across all customers. And only the variable costs such as printing, packag-
ing and mailing should be included in the cost computation. Other costs
such as overhead are not included since we assume the firm incurs no addi-
tional overhead for the marginal additional mailing.2 On the other hand, both
the expected order amount and the predicted response probability should
be considered to be heterogeneous across customers. The RFM model can
be employed to predict the response probability for each customer. As for the
expected order amount, we will first assume that it is homogeneous across all
customers. Specifically, we will predict the expected order amount for a cus-
tomer to be the average of past orders across all customers. We will discuss
the issue of estimating customer specific order amount later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>Note that the Equation 12.1 can be rewritten as r̂ &gt; C/[mE(Z)]. Given
the same expected order amount across all customers, a firm should send
the catalog only to customers whose predicted response probability is greater
than the unit cost of mailing (C) divided by the expected net contribution
dollar (mE(Z)). That is, C/[mE(Z)] is the breakeven response probabil-
ity. For example, suppose that the unit cost of mailing is $2.0, the profit
contribution margin is 50%, and customers order $80 on average. Then,
</p>
<p>2 The allocation of overhead to database marketing campaigns is an important issue.
See Chapter 6 for additional discussion. Also, see Schmid and Weber (1995), who have
suggested that the cost computation should be varied depending on the nature of
customers targeted. They claimed that only the variable costs should be considered for
prospecting while all variable costs with overheads should be counted for old customers
to be reactivated. Finally, all costs and some percentage of normal profits should be
included for current customers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.3 Breakeven Analysis: Determining the Cutoff Point 329
</p>
<p>the breakeven response probability is 0.05. Ranking its customers by their
predicted response probabilities driven by the RFM model, direct marketers
should send the mails to customers whose predicted response probabilities is
greater than 0.05.
</p>
<p>With the cost information, we can calculate the economic benefit of em-
ploying the RFM model. For example, again suppose that the unit cost of
mailing is $2, the profit contribution margin is 50%, and customers order $80
on average. The direct marketer has one million customers and their average
response probability is assumed to be 0.02. Hence, the breakeven response
rate is $2/[(0.5)($80)] = 0.05 or 5%.3
</p>
<p>Without the RFM model, the direct marketer would not know who will
respond and who will not. Hence, it randomly selects 200,000 customers
for target mailing. (We would then expect to achieve the average response
rate, 2%.) We expect that its net contribution dollar will be $160, 000(=
$80&times;0.5&times;0.02&times;200, 000) and the cost of mailing is $400, 000(= $2&times;200, 000).
So we have a $240,000 net loss. Now the direct marketer employs the RFM
model and calculates the predicted response probability for each customer.
Assume only 20% of customers (or 200,000 customers) turn out to have the re-
sponse probabilities greater than the breakeven point (0.05). So 200,000 mails
are sent to those customers and 16,000 customers (assuming the average re-
sponse rate of 8%) respond. The net contribution is $640, 000(= $80&times; 0.5&times;
16, 000) while the cost of mailings is $400, 000(= $2 &times; 200, 000). So we have
$240,000 in net profit. As a result, this direct marketer can increase its profit
from minus $240,000 to $240,000 by employing the RFM model.4
</p>
<p>12.3.2 Heterogeneous Order Amounts
</p>
<p>Now going back to the issue of the expected order amount, a simple way to
predict the dollar amount of order for a customer is to take the average of past
orders for each customer. This method is simple and still allows for utilizing
a customer-level order amount. However, its prediction may be unreliable
when the number of historical orders is small. As a result, we will observe
the regression-to-the-mean effect. Consider a customer whose historical or-
der amounts are relatively low. His or her next order will be greater than
</p>
<p>3 Practitioners often discount the predicted response rate based on the test market results
(Hughes 1996a). This is because marketers often conduct an unfair test. They tend to
use the first class mail and pick the best month for the test. As a result, the predicted
response rate is biased upward. The discount of 10&ndash;15% is usually applied, meaning
that the rollout response rate from any RFM cell is assumed to be only 85&ndash;90% of what
the test response rate was.
</p>
<p>4 For illustration, the example in this section does not explicitly consider error in model
predictions of response rates, nor long-term considerations that might influence how
deeply down the list the direct marketer will want to mail. See Chapter 10 for further
discussions.</p>

<p>330 12 RFM Analysis
</p>
<p>this historical average (based on a small sample) because of the regression-
to-the-mean effect. The opposite result is expected for those customers with
historically high order amounts (Schmittlein and Peterson 1994). Recogniz-
ing this problem of the simple average approach, researchers have developed
more sophisticated models (Schmittlein and Peterson 1994; Jen et al. 1996;
Colombo and Jiang 1999).
</p>
<p>Here we describe the model by Colombo and Jiang (1999) in more detail
since their model makes perhaps the most reasonable distributional assump-
tion. For a given customer, the dollar amount of order will vary from pur-
chase occasion to occasion. And the amount cannot be negative. They use
a gamma distribution with parameter u and θ to model the possible ran-
dom variation of order amounts over time. [On the other hand, Schmittlein
and Peterson (1994) and Jen et al. (1996) have proposed a normal distrib-
ution.] This gamma distribution has a mean of u/θ. In order to allow this
mean to vary across customers, they keep u constant and allow θ to vary as
another gamma distribution with parameters v and φ. The (unconditional)
distribution for z, the observed dollar amount, is then given by
</p>
<p>P (z|u, v, φ) = Γ(u+ v)
Γ(u)Γ(v)
</p>
<p>(
z
</p>
<p>φ+ z
</p>
<p>)u (
φ
</p>
<p>φ+ z
</p>
<p>)v 1
z
</p>
<p>(12.2)
</p>
<p>The above equation can be used to estimate the parameters u, v and φ using
maximum likelihood from the observed dollar amounts of orders.
</p>
<p>Colombo and Jiang (1999) also derived the expected amount of order (wi)
for customer i, given that his/her average amount of order is zi across the
past xi number of purchases. That is,
</p>
<p>E(wi) =
u(xizi + φ)
(uxi + v &minus; 1) =
</p>
<p>[
v &minus; 1
</p>
<p>uxi + v &minus; 1
]
</p>

</p>
<p>v &minus; 1 +
[
</p>
<p>uxi
uxi + v &minus; 1
</p>
<p>]
zi (12.3)
</p>
<p>Equation 12.3 shows that individual customer-level expected amount of or-
der is a weighted average of the expected order amount across all customers,
uφ/(v&minus; 1), and customer-level observed average amount of order, zi. As the
number of transactions for customer i (xi) increases, more weight will be as-
signed to his/her observed average amount of order. For example, Colombo
and Jiang applied their model to the direct marketing data and estimated
u = 2.9, v = 2.5, and φ = $496. Hence, the population mean, uφ/(v &minus; 1), is
calculated to be $953. Let us compare two customers, one with two transac-
tions (xi = 2) and the other with 100 transactions (xi = 100). Assume that
the average amount of order is $500 for both customers. Then the expected
amount of order is $502 for the customer with 100 transactions and $592 for
the customer with 2 transactions. As the number of historical transactions
gets smaller, less weight is assigned to the observed average amount of order.
As a result, its expected amount of order converges or &ldquo;shrinks&rdquo; more to the
population mean.</p>

<p>12.4 Extending the RFM Model 331
</p>
<p>12.4 Extending the RFM Model
</p>
<p>Direct marketers have widely used the RFM model partly because it is easy
to understand and it often predicts well. However, not many people know
why it works and when it works. Recently researchers have criticized various
aspects of the RFM model (Wheaton 1996; Yang 2004).
</p>
<p>First, the coding of recency, frequency and monetary value is arbitrary.
Quintiles (creating 5 recency, 5 frequency, and 5 monetary value divisions) are
frequently used, and hence 125 segments are assumed. However, depending
on budget, finer or cruder RFM coding may be employed (Hughes 1996a).
Because of this ad hoc coding scheme, the resulting RFM cells often fail to
generate response differences between segments. Yang (2004) has recently
developed a more formal procedure to determine the number of RFM cells.
</p>
<p>Second, direct marketers today are collecting additional customer-level
information including their demographics and behavioral characteristics. In-
corporating this information into the traditional RFM model would improve
the predictive performance. However, it is cumbersome to add other variables
to RFM models. Practitioners simply treat additional variables the same as
RFM variables. For example, with a new variable, say gender (male or fe-
male), the number of RFMG cells becomes 2 &times; 5 &times; 5 &times; 5 = 500. As the
number of additional variables increases, the number of cells will geometri-
cally increase. It is unrealistic to estimate RFM model with more than two
additional variables.
</p>
<p>12.4.1 Treating the RFM Model as ANOVA
</p>
<p>We formally evaluate the RFM model by formulating it as a formal statistical
method. We then provide several suggestions on improving the traditional
RFM model. Statistically speaking, the RFM model is simply a three-way
ANOVA (analysis of variance) with all main effects and interactions. More
specifically, consider a factorial experiment where we have three treatment
conditions. Each of three treatments (recency, frequency, and monetary) has
three levels (1, 2, and 3) and, hence, we need to estimate 3 &times; 3 &times; 3 = 27
parameters if all interactions are allowed. The RFM model is identical to the
full model for this factorial experiment.
</p>
<p>Let us provide an example. Table 12.2 shows the results of 3&times; 3&times; 3 RFM
model applied to the response data for catalog mailing drops. Catalogs are
mailed to 4,000 customers, and 325 of them responded. The overall response
rate was 8.13%. The response rates widely varied across the 27 RFM cells,
from 1.14% to 23.08%. Now we apply the three-way ANOVA with all main
effects and interactions. Table 12.2 shows its results. Note that we estimate
27 parameters, which are the same as in RFM model. We can calculate the
response probabilities of 27 RFM cells from these 27 parameter estimates.</p>

<p>The three-way ANOVA with all main effects and interactions can be written
as
</p>
<p>&micro;RFM = &micro;+ &micro;R + &micro;F + &micro;M + &micro;R&lowast;F + &micro;F&lowast;M + &micro;R&lowast;M + &micro;R&lowast;F&lowast;M (12.4)
</p>
<p>where &micro; is the overall mean response rate (intercept), &micro;R is the recency main
effect, &micro;F is the frequency main effect, &micro;M is the monetary main effect, &micro;R&lowast;F
is the recency&ndash;frequency interaction effect, &micro;F&lowast;M is the frequency&ndash;monetary
interaction effect, &micro;R&lowast;M is the recency&ndash;monetary interaction effect, and
&micro;R&lowast;F&lowast;M is the recency&ndash;frequency&ndash;monetary triple interaction effect. For
example, the response rate of (R = 1,F = 1,M = 1) cell is
</p>
<p>0.054&minus; 0.019 + 0.035&minus; 0.072&minus; 0.059 + 0.005&minus; 0.024 = 0.057
which is identical to the response rate of cell (1,1,1) in Table 12.2.
</p>
<p>Interpreting RFM model as ANOVA allows us to evaluate a traditional
RFM model with formal statistical methodology. As a result, we are in
a position to propose new types of RFM models. For example, Table 12.3</p>

</p>
<p>shows that among the main effects, only recency and frequency are sta-
tistically significant at the p = 0.05 level. Response rates are not dif-
ferent across customers with different monetary values. In addition, the
recency&ndash;frequency interaction is the only significant interaction effect. Based
on these statistical tests, we propose a simpler RFM model with a small
number of parameters without losing predictive performance. Table 12.4
shows the estimation results of this simpler RFM model. The model takes
two main effects (R and F) and an interaction term (R&lowast;F). As a result,
the number of parameters estimated has been reduced to 9 from 27. Re-
sponse rate for each of 9 cells can similarly be calculated. For example,
the response rate of (R = 1,F = 1) cell is 0.058 + 0.138 &minus; 0.030 &minus; 0.082
= 0.084.
</p>
<p>Another benefit from treating RFM model as ANOVA comes from the fact
that it becomes easier to add other variables such as consumer demograph-
ics. We can incorporate additional variables into the RFM model by employ-
ing the concept of ANCOVA (analysis of covariance). ANCOVA is a tech-
nique that combines features of ANOVA and regression (Neter et al. 1985).</p>

<p>We can augment RFM model with several additional variables &ndash; also called
concomitant variables &ndash; that are related to the response probability. These
might include demographics and other customer characteristics. This aug-
mentation will reduce the variance of error terms in the model and make the
prediction more accurate.
</p>
<p>12.4.2 Alternative Response Models Without
Discretization
</p>
<p>Although the RFM model has been used for decades, some researchers have
criticized its heuristic nature and proposed alternative response models such
as decision trees and logistic regression (Wheaton 1996). Using mail response
data from the collectible industry, Levin and Zahavi (2001) compared the
predictive performance of the RFM model to decision trees and logistic re-
gression. They found that the RFM model was the worst, and logistic regres-
sion was slightly better than decision trees. However, as Levin and Zahavi
(2001) themselves have point out, these results may be specific to the appli-
cation. These studies empirically showed the inferiority of RFM model for a
given data, but could not theoretically explain why RFM model worked or
did not work.
</p>
<p>Treating RFM model as ANOVA allows us theoretically to compare it
with other popular response models. Since a main criticism given to RFM
model is its discretization of recency, frequency and monetary values, as an
alternative model, we propose a classical linear regression where the depen-
dent variable is customer response (0 or 1) and independent variables are
customers&rsquo; original recency, frequency, and monetary values before trans-</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12.4 Extending the RFM Model 335
</p>
<p>formed to discrete scores.5 The regression model has two advantages over
RFM model. First, the number of parameters estimated is significantly re-
duced. Only 4 parameters are required to estimate in regression model while
125 parameters (assumed 5 &times; 5 &times; 5 model) are estimated in RFM model.
Hence, we will get more accurate parameter estimates. Second, we may
experience some information losses in the RFM model due to discretiza-
tion. In contrast, there is no information loss with the regression model
since it uses the original independent variables, Moreover, we can avoid
the problem of arbitrarily determining the number of codes, say 5 levels for
recency.
</p>
<p>However, we can imagine situations where RFM model may perform
better than the regression model. The relationship between the inde-
pendent variables and the dependent variable may be highly nonlin-
ear (especially, not monotonic). In this case, the discrete form of RFM
model (or ANOVA) will work better. The linear regression model as-
sumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent vari-
ables and the dependent variable. Similarly, the logistic regression assumes
that there is a monotonic (consistently positive or negative) relationship
between the independent variables and the dependent variable. On the
other hand, the RFM model will well approximate the nonlinear relation-
ship by discretizing the independent variables. Secondly, we expect that
RFM model will work better than the linear or logistic regression model
when there are significant interactions among independent variables. The
regression model cannot include interactions among variables unless re-
searchers explicitly incorporate them. On the other hands, the RFM model
(or ANOVA) automatically considers and estimates interactions among
variables.
</p>
<p>Alternative response models to RFM model are decision trees such as
CHAID and CART (Levin and Zahavi 2001). Decision trees overcome the
limitations of the linear and logistic regression models even though they have
their own weaknesses (see Chapter 17). The way of approximating the nonlin-
earity in the RFM model is based on variable discretization. The RFM model
typically uses five codes with even percentiles. But the number of codes is
arbitrary. For highly nonlinear relationship, you may need ten codes. In ad-
dition, even percentiles are also arbitrary. Decision trees can not only handle
nonlinear relationship but also incorporate interactions among variables in a
more formal and parsimonious way (see Chapter 17).
</p>
<p>Finally, statisticians have recently developed nonlinear regression models
such as kernel smoothing, radial-basis function neural nets, multilayer per-
ceptron neural networks, additive models, that can fit highly nonlinear curves
in formal and semi-automatic ways (Fahrmeir and Tutz 1994). Similarly,
these modern regression models can incorporate interactions among indepen-
</p>
<p>5 If you are concerned about the discrete nature of the dependent variable, you can use
the logit or probit model instead. Still, the independent variables are customers&rsquo; recency,
frequency, and monetary value.</p>

<p>dent variables. They are theoretically complex and not easy to understand.
But many commercial packages with easy-to-use icons have become available
so that database marketers can implement them without strong statistical
training.
</p>
<p>12.4.3 A Stochastic RFM Model by Colombo and
Jiang (1999)
</p>
<p>The RFM model simplifies the analysis of customer behavior by summarizing
historical transaction data by three RFM variables. However, much informa-
tion may be lost through summarization. This raises a possibility that without
any summarization more comprehensive statistical models can be employed
to analyze consumer purchase data in direct marketing. Moreover, it is not
theoretically justified to use RFM variables in predicting future response.
</p>
<p>Colombo and Jiang (1999) overcome these problems of the traditional
RFM model by developing a formal model of buyer behavior rooted in well-
established stochastic models. We describe their model for solicited trans-
actions where consumers purchase in response to a specific offer such as a
catalog.6
</p>
<p>Suppose that customer i with a true unobserved response probability of πi
will respond ri times tomi solicitations. If the response probability is constant
across all solicitations, then the distribution of the number of responses to
mi solicitations is given by the binomial distribution. That is,
</p>
<p>P (r = ri|mi, πi) =
(
mi
ri
</p>
<p>)
πrii (1&minus; πi)mi&minus;ri (12.5)
</p>
<p>Since the true response probability of πi is heterogeneous across consumers,
we assume that the πi&rsquo;s have a beta distribution given by
</p>
<p>f(π|α, β) = Γ(α+ β)
Γ(α)Γ(β)
</p>
<p>πα&minus;1(1&minus; π)β&minus;1 (12.6)
</p>
<p>The beta distribution has extensively been used to incorporate heterogeneity
in consumer response in marketing (Lilien et al. 1992). Depending on the
values of the parameters α and β, it can take a variety of shapes such as
U-shape, J-shape, inverted U-shape, and so on.
</p>
<p>From Equations 12.5 and 12.6, the observed number of responses (ri) to
mi solicitations can be shown to follow a beta-binomial distribution:
</p>
<p>6 Colombo and Jiang (1999) also developed a model for unsolicited transactions where
customers buy from a firm at any time rather than in response to a direct communi-
cations. We focus our attention on the case of solicited transactions because catalog
industry has actively used traditional RFM models.</p>

</p>
<p>This distribution relates customer response behavior to the parameters of the
beta distribution, α and β. Hence, their values can be estimated by maximum
likelihood. Once α and β are estimated, we can easily calculate the expected
response probability for customer i as
</p>
<p>P (πi|ri,mi, α, β) = α+ ri
α+ β +mi
</p>
<p>(12.8)
</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the only customer-level information
Equation 12.8 requires is the number of solicitations (mi) and the number
of responses (ri). That is, mi and ri are sufficient statistics for an individ-
ual customer&rsquo;s purchase history. This fact theoretically justifies the use of
frequency in a traditional RFM model.
</p>
<p>So far, we have assumed that all customers in the database are active.
However, some customers may be inactive because they are unable or unwill-
ing to purchase the product from the firm. Customers in a non-subscription
setting do not usually give notice to the firm when they leave. Hence, the firm
needs to infer the status of the customers from their transaction histories. For
example, if a customer has not purchase for a long period of time, he or she
can be considered to be inactive. Several researchers have studied models to
estimate the probability that a customer is active given his or her transaction
histories (Schmittlein and Peterson 1994; Schmittlein et al. 1987; Fader et al.
2005). We do not cover them in this chapter since these models are developed
for unsolicited transactions where purchases are not directly solicited by the
firm and they can occur at any time. See Chapter 5 for descriptions of these
approaches.</p>

<p>Market Basket Analysis
</p>
<p>Abstract Market basket analysis scrutinizes the products customers tend to
buy together, and uses the information to decide which products should be
cross-sold or promoted together. The term arises from the shopping carts su-
permarket shoppers fill up during a shopping trip. The rise of the Internet has
provided an entirely new venue for compiling and analyzing such data. This
chapter discusses the key concepts of &ldquo;confidence,&rdquo; &ldquo;support,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lift&rdquo; as
applied to market basket analysis, and how these concepts can be translated
into actionable metrics and extended.
</p>
<p>13.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Marketing researchers have been interested in studying product affinity for
a long time. We have learned from the introductory economics or market-
ing course that coffee and sugar are complements while coffee and tea are
substitutes. The price reduction of a product not only increases its own
demand but also increases demand of its complementary product. That
is, if two products are complements for each other, their demands tend
to be positively associated. On the other hand, if two products are sub-
stitutes for each other, their demands tend to be negatively correlated
since the price reduction of a product would decrease the demand of its
substitute.
</p>
<p>Marketing practitioners are interested in product affinities because they
provide very useful information for designing various marketing strategies. It
may not be surprising to a supermarket manager to see that coffee is pur-
chased with coffee cream or sugar. In fact, an experienced manager may know
lots of product pairs purchased together by consumers. However, considering
that the typical supermarkets carry tens of thousands items, it is also likely
that there are thousands of associated product pairs the manager may not
have recognized. Maybe the best-known example in the data mining industry

<p>340 13 Market Basket Analysis
</p>
<p>is that beers and diapers tend to be purchased together in the supermarket.1
</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons are, the beer&ndash;diaper association is not obvious to the
manager. Market basket analysis is designed to find these types of product
associations with minimal human interaction.
</p>
<p>Typically the input to a market basket analysis is point-of-sale (POS)
transaction data at the customer level. Market basket analysis extracts many
interesting product associations from transaction data. Hence its output
consists of a series of product association rules: for example, if customers
buy product A they also tend to buy product B. Market basket analysis alle-
viates managerial effort and automates the process for finding which products
are purchased together. Let the data speak for itself.
</p>
<p>Market basket analysis was originally applied to supermarket transaction
data. Actually it takes its name from the fact that consumers in a supermarket
place all of their purchased items into the shopping cart or the market basket.
Nowadays the application of market basket analysis is not limited to the
supermarket. It can be applied to any industry selling multiple products such
as banks, catalogers, direct marketers and so on, and to new sales channels,
especially the Internet.
</p>
<p>13.2 Benefits for Marketers
</p>
<p>The output of a market basket analysis is a series of association rules. These
rules are used to improve the efficiency of marketing strategies and tactics.
We learn from the analysis which products/services are purchased at the
same time or in a particular sequence. Hence the rules can be very useful
and actionable for firms dealing with multiple products/services. Examples
are retailers, financial institutions (e.g., credit cards company), catalog mar-
keters, direct marketers, Internet merchants, and so on (Berry and Linoff
1997). Market basket analysis is especially popular among retailers because
of their large number of SKUs. In a recent Aberdeen Group survey, 38% of
the retailers polled said they used market basket analysis and felt it had a
positive effect on their business (Nishi 2005).
</p>
<p>Market basket provides valuable information for firms to develop various
marketing strategies and tactics. First, association rules from a market basket
analysis can be used for a supermarket to manage its shelf space. It may stock
the associated items close together such that consumers would not forget to
purchase both items. On the other hand, it may stock the associated items
far apart such that consumers would spend more time browsing aisle by
</p>
<p>1 Thomas Blischok first discovered this interesting statistical pattern. As vice president of
industry consulting for NCR, he did a study for Osco Drug in 1992 when he discovered
dozens of correlations, including one connecting beer and diapers in transactions be-
tween 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Blischok recounted the tale in a speech, and the story became
the legend in data mining industry (Forbes 1998).</p>

<p>aisle (Chain Store Age 1998).2 Other types of merchants such as retailers,
catalogers and Internet may realize similar benefits.
</p>
<p>Second, market basket analysis can be used for designing various promo-
tional strategies. It will provide ideas on product bundling. In addition, it
can be used to design a cross-coupon program where consumers purchasing
an item A get the (discount) coupon for an item B.3 Or it will help managers
to select appropriate items to be loss leaders.
</p>
<p>Third, market basket analysis with temporal components can be very use-
ful to various marketers for selecting cross-selling items. For example, market
basket analysis might indicate that customers who have purchased whole life
insurance tend to purchase property insurance within 6 months. It suggests
a cross-selling possibility &ndash; the insurance salesperson should contact his/her
current customers with whole life insurance (within 6 months) and try to
cross-sell the property insurance.
</p>
<p>13.3 Deriving Market Basket Association Rules
</p>
<p>Since the seminal paper by Agrawal et al. (1993), the problem of deriving
association rules have been widely studied within the field of knowledge dis-
covery (Agrawal and Srikant 1994; Mannila et al. 1994; Silverstein et al. 1998;
Zhang 2000), and is often called the market basket problem. In this section,
we study how a market basket analysis works and derives various association
rules that are &ldquo;interesting.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>13.3.1 Setup of a Market Basket Problem
</p>
<p>The input for a market basket analysis is customer-level transactions data,
although it is not necessary that each customer be explicitly identified. For
example, grocery stores record each customer&rsquo;s transaction data (&ldquo;market
basket&rdquo;) with their scanning device even though they do not know the cus-
tomer&rsquo;s name, address, etc. For each transaction, the store knows the date,
the casher number, items purchased, prices of each item, coupons redeemed,
and so on. Table 13.1 shows the hypothetical transaction data from a grocery
store. There are five transactions and each transaction consists of a set of
</p>
<p>2 As discussed later, market basket analysis is an exploratory data mining tool. Once
</p>
<p>an association between two products is identified, we should test two different shelf
</p>
<p>strategies (stocking two products adjacent or far apart) with control groups.
3 Dhar and Raju (1998) have developed a model to study the effects of cross-ruff coupons
</p>
<p>on consumer choice behavior and derived conditions under which cross-ruff coupons can
</p>
<p>lead to higher sales and profits than other types of package coupons. However, they did
</p>
<p>not employ market basket analysis for their empirical application.</p>

</p>
<p>items. The main focus of market basket analysis is the set of items purchased
for each transaction. From this transaction data, market basket analysis pro-
vides a series of association rules where we infer which items are purchased
together.
</p>
<p>Each association rule consists of an antecedent and a consequent. For
example, consider the association rule, &ldquo;if a consumer purchases item A,
s/he also tends to purchase item B.&rdquo; Here item A is the antecedent while
item B is the consequent. Note that both antecedent and consequent can
contain multiple items.
</p>
<p>13.3.2 Deriving &ldquo;Interesting&rdquo; Association Rules
</p>
<p>Let us intuitively derive a few association patterns from Table 13.1. At first
glance, we can see that milk and orange juice are purchased together in three
out of the five transactions. This observation may tell us that there is a cross-
selling possibility between milk and orange juice. Anything else? Ice cream
and beer are purchased together in two out of the five transactions. Again
from this pattern, we may suggest an association rule like: &ldquo;if a customer
purchases ice cream, then s/he also purchases beer,&rdquo; or more compactly, &ldquo;if
ice cream then beer.&rdquo; Similarly, we can formulate an association rule between
orange juice and soap.
</p>
<p>We can generate many association rules from Table 13.1 but we are only
interested in selecting &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; rules. That is, how managerially rele-
vant are the rules we have generated? It is difficult to come up with a single
metric quantifying the &ldquo;interestingness&rdquo; or &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; of an association rule
(Bayardo and Agrawal 1999). Hence, researchers have proposed several dif-
ferent metrics. There are three most popular criteria evaluating the quality
or the strength of an association rule: support, confidence and lift.
</p>
<p>Support is the percentage of transactions containing a particular com-
bination of items relative to the total number of transactions in the data-
base. We can think of the support for an individual item A, which would
just be the probability a transaction contains item A, or &ldquo;P(A)&rdquo;. However,
when we are interested in associations, we are concerned with multiple items,
so the support for the combination A and B would be P(AB). For example,
consider the association rule &ldquo;if milk then beer&rdquo; from Table 13.1. Support</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.3 Deriving Market Basket Association Rules 343
</p>
<p>measures how often milk and beer are purchased together, as a percentage
of the total number of transactions. They are purchased together two out of
five transactions. Hence, support for the association rule is 40%.
</p>
<p>Support for multiple items can be interpreted as a joint probability. It
measures the probability that a randomly selected basket contains item A
and item B together. Hence it is symmetric and does not hint at cause-and-
effect. We know that the joint probability of A and B, P (AB), is no different
than the joint probability of B and A, P (BA). For example, support for the
association rule &ldquo;if milk then beer&rdquo; would be the same as the support for the
association rule &ldquo;if beer then milk.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Support has one critical disadvantage in evaluating the quality of an as-
sociation rule. The example in Table 13.1 shows that the association rule
&ldquo;if beer then milk&rdquo; has support of 40%. However, is the association rule
&ldquo;if beer then milk&rdquo; an interesting rule? The answer is yes if this means
that 40% of customers buy beer and milk together and no one buys milk
without buying beer. However, Table 13.1 shows that all the transactions
contain milk. All customers buy milk and only 40% of those buy beer.
Hence, the association rule &ldquo;if beer then milk&rdquo; is not interesting even if
its support is 40%. Milk is so popular in grocery shopping (by itself it has
very high support) that the support for milk plus any other item can be
large.
</p>
<p>Confidence measures how much the consequent (item) is dependent on the
antecedent (item). In other words, confidence is the conditional probability of
the consequent given the antecedent, P (B|A). For example, the confidence for
the association rule &ldquo;if ice cream then beer&rdquo; is 66% since three transactions
contain ice cream (the antecedent) and two among the three transactions also
contain beer (the consequent). In other words, given that the baskets con-
taining ice cream is selected, there is 66% chance that the same basket also
contains beer. Different from support, confidence is asymmetric. For exam-
ple, the confidence of &ldquo;if beer then ice cream&rdquo; is 100% while the confidence
of &ldquo;if ice cream then beer&rdquo; is 66%.
</p>
<p>The law of conditional probability states that P (B|A) = P (AB)/P (A).
That is, confidence is equal to the support of the association rule divided by
the probability or the support of the antecedent. For example, the support
of an association rule &ldquo;if ice cream then beer&rdquo; is 40% (two out of five trans-
actions) while the support or the probability of ice cream is 60% (three out
of five). Hence, its confidence is 66% (40%/60%).
</p>
<p>Confidence surely is a good criterion for selecting interesting rules but is
not a perfect criterion. Consider a rule &ldquo;if ice cream then orange juice.&rdquo; Its
confidence or P (B|A) is 33% so you may think it is an interesting rule. How-
ever, there is 60% chance (e.g., P (B) = 60%) that a randomly chosen trans-
action contains orange juice. Hence, ice cream is not a powerful antecedent
for identifying an orange juice purchase &ndash; it has lower than a random chance
of identifying an orange juice purchase. Thus there is no cross-selling oppor-
tunity.</p>
<p/>

<p>344 13 Market Basket Analysis
</p>
<p>Lift (also called improvement or impact) is a measure to overcome the
problems with support and confidence. Consider an association rule &ldquo;if A then
B.&rdquo; The lift for the rule is defined as P (B|A)/P (B) or P (AB)/[P (A)P (B)].
As shown in the formula, lift is symmetric in that the lift for &ldquo;if A then B&rdquo;
is the same as the lift for &ldquo;if B then A.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>P (B) is the probability that a randomly chosen transaction contains item
B. In other words, it is an unconditional (or baseline) probability of purchas-
ing item B regardless of other items purchased. Practitioners often use the
term, &ldquo;expected confidence&rdquo; for P (B) instead of unconditional probability.
</p>
<p>Hence, lift is said to measure the difference &ndash; measured in ratio &ndash; between
the confidence of a rule and the expected confidence. For example, the lift
of an association rule &ldquo;if ice cream then beer&rdquo; is 1.67 because the expected
confidence is 40% and the confidence is 67%. This means that consumers who
purchase ice cream are 1.67 times more likely to purchase beer than randomly
chosen customers. That is, larger lift means more interesting rules.
</p>
<p>A lift of 1 has a special meaning. We know that P (AB) = P (A)P (B) if
A and B are independent. Therefore, lift equals one if the event A is inde-
pendent of the event B. Lift greater than 1 indicates that the item A and
the item B tend to occur together more often would be predicted by random
chance. Similarly, lift smaller than 1 indicates that the item A and item B are
purchased together less likely than would be predicted by random chance.
</p>
<p>Lift has little practical value when the support for the antecedent item is
very low. For example, suppose that P (mushroom pizza &amp; ice cream) = 0.01,
P (mushroom pizza) = 0.01 and P (ice cream) = 0.25. The association rule
&ldquo;if mushroom pizza then ice cream looks like a good rule based on its lift
of 4. However, only a small number of customers purchase mushroom pizza.
A co-marketing program designed to encourage mushroom pizza buyers to
purchase ice cream may not have a high impact. This problem can be partially
resolved by taxonomies described in Sect. 13.4.1.
</p>
<p>Summarizing, we have introduced three popular criteria for evaluating
association rules in market basket analysis, defined as follows:
</p>
<p>Confidence = P (B|A) (13.1a)
Support = P (BA) (13.1b)
</p>
<p>Lift = P (B|A)/P (B) (13.1c)
</p>
<p>Each criterion has its advantages and disadvantages but in general we would
like association rules that have high confidence, high support, and high lift.
Association rules with high support are potentially interesting rules. Simi-
larly, rules with high confidence would be interesting rules. Or you may look
for association rules with very high or very low lift.4 Practitioners generally
</p>
<p>4 The very low lift implies that the two products &ldquo;repel&rdquo; each other. Substitutes (e.g.,
Coke and Pepsi) tend not to be in the same basket. Knowing that two products &ldquo;repel&rdquo;
each other can often suggest actionable recommendations. For example, Coke should
not be promoted together with Pepsi.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.3 Deriving Market Basket Association Rules 345
</p>
<p>employ all three together in generating a set of interesting association rules.
They might set a threshold for each rule and let the market basket software
choose rules to meet the condition (see Chapter 21 for further discussion). For
example, practitioners might ask the software to find all associations so that
support, confidence, and lift are all greater than some minimum threshold
specification (e.g., see Yan et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>13.3.3 Zhang (2000) Measures of Association
and Dissociation
</p>
<p>Other than three metrics discussed above, researchers have proposed a num-
ber of measures including chi-square value (Morishita 1998), entropy gain
(Morimoto et al. 1998; Morishita 1998), gini (Morimoto et al. 1998) and
laplace (Webb 1995). More recently, Zhang (2000) proposed a new metric
that was theoretically shown to be better than traditional measures such as
the confidence and/or the χ2 test. He also applied his new measure (along
with traditional measures) to a POS transaction data and a donation data,
and showed that his measure could identify association patterns not discov-
ered by traditional measures. Considering the importance of finding a good
measure of association rules, we describe his measure with comparing others.
</p>
<p>Zhang&rsquo;s point of departure is to recognize the difference between asso-
ciation and disassociation. If the probability of co-occurrence P (A|B) for
patterns A and B is larger than probability of no co-occurrence P (A|B),
then the relationship of A with B is association (attractive). Otherwise,
the relationship is disassociation (repulsive). Association is described by
PA(B &rArr; A) = 1 &minus; P (A|B̄)/P (A|B) if P (A|B̄) &lt; P (A|B). Disassociation
is described by PD(B &rArr; A) = P (A|B̄)/P (A|B) &minus; 1 if P (A|B̄) &ge; P (A|B).
Combining the two formulas, we obtain
</p>
<p>P (B &rArr; A) = P (A|B)&minus; P (A|B̄)
Max[P (A|B), P (A|B̄)]
</p>
<p>=
P (AB)&minus; P (A)P (B)
</p>
<p>Max[P (AB)(1&minus; P (B)), P (B)(1&minus; P (A))] (13.2)
</p>
<p>where B &rArr; A (e.g., B implies A) describes the association of A with B.
For example, let us calculate P (beer &rArr; ice cream) in Table 13.1. Since
P (ice cream|beer) = 1 is larger than P (ice cream|not beer) = 1/3, so the
relationship of ice cream with beer is association. And P (beer &rArr; ice cream)
is equal to 2/3.
</p>
<p>The association metric in Equation 13.2 is asymmetric. That is, P (B &rArr; A)
can be different from P (A &rArr; B). Zhang&rsquo;s metric has several other good prop-
erties. For example, consider three extreme cases: perfect association, perfect
disassociation, and random or independent association. A good measure of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>346 13 Market Basket Analysis
</p>
<p>association should yield a definitive result for each case. In other words, the
result a measure of association should yield a constant number, indepen-
dent of P (A) and/or P (B), for perfect association, perfect disassociation, or
independent association.
</p>
<p>The following table calculates the value for support, confidence, lift, and
Zhang&rsquo;s measure for each of the three cases:
</p>
<p>Support Confidence Lift Zhang
</p>
<p>Perfect Association P (A)(=)P (B) 1 1/P (B) 1
Perfect Dissociation 0 0 0 &minus;1
Independence P (A)P (B) P (B) 1 0
</p>
<p>The table shows that only Zhang&rsquo;s measure provides a unique number
for all three cases. This means that Zhang&rsquo;s measure has a similar inter-
pretation as a correlation coefficient: values close to 1 signify almost perfect
positive association, values close to &minus;1 signify almost perfect negative asso-
ciation, and values close to zero mean very little relationship. None of the
other measures has this nice numerical interpretation.
</p>
<p>13.4 Issues in Market Basket Analysis
</p>
<p>13.4.1 Using Taxonomies to Overcome the
Dimensionality Problem
</p>
<p>The typical supermarket in the US carries about 30,000 items or SKUs (stock
keeping units). It means that we need to evaluate about 4.5 &times; 108 potential
association rules such as the ones &ldquo;if A then B.&rdquo; Furthermore, as discussed
later, you may be interested in association rules involved in more than two
items. The &ldquo;curse of dimensionality&rdquo; comes into play unless we control the
number of items to a manageable size.
</p>
<p>Much research has focused on algorithms for computing all relevant asso-
ciations (Agrawal et al. 1993; Agrawal and Srikant 1994; Hu et al. 2000; Yan
et al. 2005). However, another way to overcome dimensionality problem is to
aggregate items into some manageable number of categories. For example,
Tropicana orange juices with various sizes can be grouped into the Tropicana
orange juice category. Or different types of Tropicana juices such as orange
and grape juice may be aggregated. More generalized categories such as the
juice category (after aggregating all juices with different brands, sizes and
types) can also be used as the input for market basket analysis.
</p>
<p>There is another benefit from item aggregation. Unit sales of many SKUs
in the original market basket data are so small. Hence, their supports are</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.4 Issues in Market Basket Analysis 347
</p>
<p>extremely low. As shown in the previous section, the presence of low-support
items may make it difficult to find good association rules. For example, sup-
pose that there is only one transaction including Brand A orange juice in the
entire basket data. And the transaction containing Brand A orange juice also
includes yogurt. The confidence of the association rule, &ldquo;if Brand A orange
juice then yogurt,&rdquo; for this basket data is 100%. But it is not an interesting
association rule. We can easily avoid this problem through item aggregation.
</p>
<p>Obviously, as we employ higher levels of aggregation, the computational
burden for the market basket analysis is diminished. However, item aggre-
gation often leads to the loss of transaction details useful for developing ac-
tionable marketing strategies. Suppose that the result of the market basket
analysis suggests the cross-promotion opportunity between beer and orange
juice. It is unusual for a supermarket to promote all items in the orange juice
category together. Instead, they promote a particular brand of orange juice.
The market basket data aggregated across brands does not allow the manager
to select a brand for target promotion.
</p>
<p>What is the right level of item aggregation for a market basket analysis?
Practitioners often suggest aggregating items such that each of the resulting
aggregates have roughly the same level of appearance or support in the market
basket data (for example, see www.megaputer.com/html/mba.html). As a
result, items with smaller unit sales will be grouped together so that we can
avoid the problem of bad association rules due to the low support items.
However, one should not apply this suggestion too strictly. The needs of the
end user are more important in deciding the level of aggregation. For example,
the marketing manager in a discount store will be more interested in selling
a television than a DVD. That is, it may be more reasonable to aggregate
cheap items than expensive items.
</p>
<p>13.4.2 Association Rules for More than Two Items
</p>
<p>So far, we have investigated association rules with two items &ndash; one antecedent
and one consequent. However, managers might be interested in association
rules involving more than two items. The idea behind market basket analysis
with two items can be easily extended to the analysis of more than two
items. For example, consider an association rule, &ldquo;if A and B then C.&rdquo; The
support of this association rule is P (ABC) and its confidence is P (C|AB).
And P (C|AB)/P (C) is its lift. Similar analysis can be performed for the sets
of four items, five and so on.
</p>
<p>As discussed above, the curse of dimensionality comes into play as the
number of items considered simultaneously increases. The number of calcula-
tions to perform the market basket analysis increases exponentially with the
number of items to be considered together. For example, going back to the
supermarket with 30,000 items, we need to evaluate 30000C3(&asymp; 4.5 &times; 1012)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>348 13 Market Basket Analysis
</p>
<p>potential association rules such as the ones &ldquo;if A and B then C.&rdquo; And about
3.4&times; 1016 calculations are required for the sets of four items.
</p>
<p>Researchers have suggested various pruning methods to overcome the di-
mensionality problem associated with the market basket analysis of multiple
items (Agrawal et al. 1993). One easy pruning method is to generate associa-
tion rules that satisfy a given support constraint. In addition, is the pruning
is performed iteratively so that the number of calculations can be minimized.
For example, given the support constraint of 1%, any items less than this
minimum support are first eliminated and only the remaining items are used
for the analysis of two items. For association rules for three items, any pairs of
items less than the support constraint are eliminated and only the remaining
pairs of items are used as antecedents. Similar iterative pruning is applied
for generating association rules involved with more than three items. Yan et
al. (2005) assert that even simple pruning rules that use thresholds can re-
sult in too many calculations, and propose a genetic algorithm for producing
interesting associations.
</p>
<p>13.4.3 Adding Virtual Items to Enrich the Quality of
the Market Basket Analysis
</p>
<p>Market basket analysis has originally been developed to study association
patterns among items sold in supermarket. However, it becomes a much
more useful data mining tool when items considered are not restricted to
real products. Virtual items are not real products sold in retail stores, but
they are treated as items in the market basket analysis. For example, mar-
keting managers may be interested in knowing which items are sold well with
male customers. The market basket analysis can provide this information
simply by adding one more virtual item (sex identifier: &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;female&rdquo;)
to each transaction basket.
</p>
<p>Practically, the number of virtual items can be unlimited. They may in-
clude customer demographic information such as income, household size, ed-
ucation and so on. Sometimes customer&rsquo;s purchase behavioral information &ndash;
for example, the type of payment (e.g., cash or credit cards), the day of the
week that the purchase is made, etc. &ndash; is used as virtual items. Or marketing
variables such as the indicator for temporary price reductions and special
display are often used as virtual items.
</p>
<p>Creating relevant virtual items definitely enriches the quality of the market
basket analysis. However, it does run into the curse of dimensionality prob-
lem described earlier. Therefore, before you decide to add the virtual items to
the market basket data, you should have some idea or hypothesis on how the
results of analysis associated with virtual items help marketing managers to
solve their decision making problems. For example, supermarkets typically se-
lect a set of items every week and discount their prices significantly &ndash; called</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.4 Issues in Market Basket Analysis 349
</p>
<p>loss leaders &ndash; to increase the number of shoppers visiting their stores. Super-
market managers know that they lose money by selling loss leader items. But
most of supermarkets employ this strategy since they expect that consumers
would shop a lot of other (non-discounted) products. We can detect various
issues associated with the loss leader strategy by adding the indicator of the
loss leader item as virtual item.
</p>
<p>13.4.4 Adding Temporal Component to the Market
Basket Analysis
</p>
<p>Market basket analysis was originally designed to analyze which products are
purchased together at a given shopping trip. However, it can be applied to
broader marketing problems if we incorporate a temporal component. This
makes it more applicable to identifying cross-selling possibilities. For example,
a segment of bank customers might open a savings account after they open
checking accounts. Or customers who have purchased personal computers
may tend to purchase printers within the next 3 months.
</p>
<p>Researchers have attempted to accommodate a time-series component
into market basket analysis to broaden its application domain (Agrawal
and Srikant 1995; Chen et al. 1998; Ramaswamy et al. 1998). They have
shown that temporal components can be incorporated into the existing as-
sociation rule algorithm with minor modification. However, there is one
big difference in terms of the data required. In particular, we need panel
data whereby particular customers are identified and observed over time.
Previously, each transaction was treated independently and there was no
need to track whose transaction it is. To conduct a temporal analysis, a
data-gathering system must track customer identification in order to re-
late transactions occurring at different times. For example, the traditional
scanning device in the supermarket may provide transaction data with
anonymous customer identity that is not appropriate for the market bas-
ket analysis with temporal component. To incorporate the temporal compo-
nent, a customer identification device such as a store loyalty card is required
where a cash register first scans the customer&rsquo;s store card and scans items
purchased.
</p>
<p>A temporal association rule can be considered a traditional association
rule with some temporal relationships between items in the antecedent and
the consequent. Theoretically, we need to consider all possible pairwise com-
binations among all transactions made by a given customer. As a result, we
have all possible &ldquo;before item(s)&rdquo; (in the antecedent) and &ldquo;after item(s)&rdquo;
(in the consequent) pairs. Because of this combinatorial nature of the prob-
lem, again the curse of dimensionality comes into play. For example, we
need to consider 450(= 100C2) paired combinations for a customer with
100 transactions.</p>

Detergent Orange juice 0.20 1.00 1.67
Pizza Ice cream 0.20 0.50 1.25
Beer Soap 0.20 0.50 1.25
</p>
<p>An easy way to reduce the number of paired combinations is to restrict
the temporal space of interest. For example, we may focus on temporal as-
sociation for the &ldquo;next shopping trips&rdquo; where we now consider 99 pairwise
comparisons for a customer with 100 transactions. Or we may restrict our
attention to the transactions &ldquo;within 2 months&rdquo; from the transaction date of
the antecedent.
</p>
<p>13.5 Conclusion
</p>
<p>There are several commercially available data mining software packages for
performing market basket analysis. Examples are Integral Solutions&rsquo; Clemen-
tine (marketed by SPSS), Silicon Graphics&rsquo; MineSet, etc. that provide market
basket analysis as a differentiating feature from other data mining products.
Marketing managers without much statistical expertise can perform market
basket analysis by clicking icons and interpreting the output without much
difficulty.
</p>
<p>Most market basket analysis software presents its output or association
rules either in tabular form or in plain English. Most software allows users to
specify selection criteria and sort the resulting association rules by support,
lift, confidence, antecedent or consequent. Table 13.2 shows the output exam-
ple in compact tabular form. We have here applied market basket analysis to
the transaction data given in Table 13.1, selected the association rules with
lifts greater than one, and sorted them by lift. Also note that we have limited
the association rules to two items.
</p>
<p>Some software presents results in plain English. For example, the associa-
tion rules in Table 13.2 might be presented as the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; When a customer buys Orange Juice then the customer also buys Soap
in 67% of cases. This pattern is present in 40% of transactions.5
</p>
<p>5 This paragraph means that the confidence of the association &lsquo;if orange juice then beer&rsquo;
is 67% and its support is 40%.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>13.5 Conclusion 351
</p>
<p>&bull; When a customer buys Orange Juice then the customer also buys De-
tergent in 33% of cases. This pattern is present in 20% of transactions.
</p>
<p>&bull; When a customer buys Ice Cream then the customer also buys Beer in
67% of cases. This pattern is present in 40% of transactions.
</p>
<p>Market basket analysis is an attractive data mining tool for several reasons.
First, relative to other data mining tools, it is computationally simple. Sec-
ond, its outputs are easy to understand because they are expressed in the
form of association rules. Third, it is actionable in that it is easy for mar-
keting managers to turn the association rules into marketing strategies and
tactics.
</p>
<p>Market basket analysis is particularly well suited to the problems without
well-defined marketing objectives. You simply have a large set of data (e.g.,
POS transaction data from a supermarket) and you do not have specific
hypothesis to test because you do not have much experience analyzing them.
That is, it is a good undirected data mining technique. Market basket analysis
can also be used for directed data mining tasks (Zhang 2000). But we suggest
other statistically sound techniques when you have clear hypothesis to test.</p>

<p>Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>Abstract Collaborative filtering is a relatively new technique to the data-
base marketing field, gaining popularity with the advent of the Internet and
the need for &ldquo;recommendation engines.&rdquo; We discuss the two major forms of
collaborative filtering: memory-based and model-based. The classic memory-
based method is &ldquo;nearest neighbor,&rdquo; where predictions of a target customer&rsquo;s
preferences for a target product are based on customers who appear to have
similar tastes to the target customer. A more recently used method is item-
based collaborative filtering, which is model-based. In item-based collabo-
rative filtering predictions of a target customer&rsquo;s preferences are based on
whether customers who like the same products the target customer likes
tend to like the target product. We discuss these and several other methods
of collaborative filtering, as well as current issues and extensions.
</p>
<p>14.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>One day you rent a movie, &ldquo;Independence Day,&rdquo; at a video rental store.
You are surprised at the cash register to find that there are ten movie titles
recommended on your receipt that happen to match your interests pretty
well. An automatic collaborative filtering system in the store has a database
storing the movie tastes of many other customers. It identifies customers
in the database who like &ldquo;Independence Day,&rdquo; finds out what other movies
they liked, and recommends the ten most liked movie titles to you. It
automatically recommends a set of movie titles as an expert, or more to the
point, a friend would.
</p>
<p>Collaborative filtering is a recently developed data mining technique.
Its main concept originated from work in the area of information filtering
and first introduced by Goldberg et al. (1992). Their email filtering system,
called Tapestry, innovated the field of recommendation system even though
it required users to evaluate items explicitly and respond to complex queries.
Since then, the system has been improved to become automatic (Resnick

<p>et al. 1994) and the algorithm has been fine-tuned (Shardanand and Maes
1995). More recently, a number of websites including Amazon.com, CD-
Now.com and MovieFinder.com have adopted collaborative filtering systems
to provide personalized recommendations to their customers. Collaborative
filtering is broadening its base of applications to include financial services,
travel agencies, and so on.
</p>
<p>Let us take an example of movie selection to understand the task applied
to collaborative filtering. The objective of collaborative filtering is to select
(and then recommend) a set of movies that each customer will like. The typ-
ical input data takes the form of preference ratings on each product/item
evaluated by users. As shown on Table 14.1, it is the n&times;m user-item matrix
(n users; m items) with each cell representing a user/consumer&rsquo;s preference
rating on a specific item/product. Our main task is to predict the prefer-
ence ratings for missing cells, based on other observed preference ratings. For
example, Amy has rated Movies 1, 2, 4 and 5. Then what is Amy&rsquo;s predicted
preference rating for Movie 3? Similarly, we wish to predict the missing pref-
erence ratings for all other customers. Once we have all the predicted movie
ratings, we are ready to provide movie recommendations for each customer
(e.g., suggest three highly rated movies for each customer).
</p>
<p>14.2 Memory-Based Methods
</p>
<p>There are a number of algorithms used in collaborative filtering, but they
can be divided into two main categories, memory-based and model-based
(Sarwar et al. 2001). Memory-based methods, also called neighborhood-
based, user-based or heuristic methods, attempt to find a set of users that
have similar preferences to the target user. Once a neighborhood of users is
identified, memory-based methods combine their preferences to predict the
preference of the target user. On the other hand, model-based methods first
develop a model of user ratings. They usually take a probabilistic approach
and calculate the expected preference for the target user. We first study
memory-based methods in this section and describe model-based methods
in the next section.
</p>
<p>Memory-based methods predict the unobserved preferences of an active
or target user based on the (observed) preferences of other users. Let ri,j</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.2 Memory-Based Methods 355
</p>
<p>be the preference rating of user i on item j (e.g., the value of cell in row i
and column j in Table 14.1). The neighborhood-based method predicts the
preference rating of an active user a for item j (r̂a,j) from the following
equation.
</p>
<p>r̂a,j = ra + τ
n&sum;
</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>sa,i(ri,j &minus; ri) (14.1)
</p>
<p>where ri is the mean preference rating of user i, ra is the mean preference
rating of the active user, sa,i is the similarity between user a and user i
and τ is the normalizing constant such that the
</p>
<p>&sum;n
i=1 |sa,i| becomes one.
</p>
<p>The mean preference rating is computed over the set of items that the user
has evaluated. Note that the summation will only be applied to users whose
preference ratings on item j are observed. For example, for predicting the
preference of user a on &ldquo;Independence Day&rdquo; we incorporate only the ratings
of users who have evaluated &ldquo;Independence Day.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The predicted rating in Equation 14.1 consists of two components: the ac-
tive user&rsquo;s own mean preference rating and the observed ratings of other
users in the database. Without ratings from other users, the best guess for
r̂a,j is the mean of the user&rsquo;s previous preference ratings over other items. The
beauty of collaborative filtering is the capability of improving the prediction
accuracy by incorporating other users&rsquo; opinions. The user i who experienced
item j evaluates her preference rating for item j as ri,j . So her relative pref-
erence is (ri,j &minus; ri). This might suggest that the active user will also prefer
movie j higher than her average. However, this depends on whether the ac-
tive user and user i have similar tastes. This is measured by the similarity in
tastes between the two users, sa,i, which can be positive (the active user and
user i tend to like the same movies) or negative (the active user and user i
tend to have opposite tastes in movies).
</p>
<p>The relative ratings of users who have rated on item j will be combined
to predict r̂a,j , but the contribution of each user (sa,i) will be different. If
the other user is &ldquo;similar&rdquo; to the active user, a larger weight is assigned.
If the other user is less similar to the active user, his or her opinions are
not reflected heavily on the predicted preference rating of the active user. In
sum, the predicted rating is her mean preference rating plus the weighted
sum of other users&rsquo; relative preferences. And the weights are determined by
the similarity between each user and the active user.
</p>
<p>The use of relative preference rather than absolute preference is based
on the recognition that rating distributions are centered at different points
for different users (Herlocker et al. 1999). Herlocker et al. show that the
method using relative preference provides significantly better prediction ac-
curacy than the method of using absolute preference. Some users may tend
to use categories 3 to 5 on a five point rating scale while others may tend to
use categories 1 to 3. If a user gives the same ratings for all items, her rating
distribution will not provide any information for predicting the rating of the
active user.</p>
<p/>

<p>356 14 Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>Going one step further, Herlocker et al. (1999) have also tried to incorpo-
rate the difference in spread between users&rsquo; rating distributions. The original
ratings are converted to z-scores with mean zero and variance one. However,
this did not perform significantly better than relative preference approach.
The authors conclude that the difference in variance among users&rsquo; rating
distributions does not influence the prediction performance, but the mean
difference does.
</p>
<p>14.2.1 Computing Similarity Between Users
</p>
<p>Similarity between users, sa,i, is the most important concept in the
neighborhood-based collaborative filtering. Mainly based on the work of
Breese et al. (1998) and Herlocker et al. (1999), this section reviews
various similarity measures and their modifications used in collaborative
filtering.
</p>
<p>14.2.1.1 Similarity Measures
</p>
<p>Researchers have proposed a number of different metrics that measure the
similarity or the distance between users. We describe three similarity mea-
sures: Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation, and cosine vector sim-
ilarity. Other similarity measures including the entropy-based uncertainty
measure and mean-squared difference have been applied but found not to
perform as well as Pearson correlation (Herlocker et al. 1999)
</p>
<p>Pearson Correlation Coefficient
</p>
<p>The most popular similarity measure may be Pearson correlation coeffi-
cient that GroupLens first introduced in its neighborhood-based algorithm
(Resnick et al. 1994). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the active
user a and the user i is given by
</p>
<p>sa,i =
</p>
<p>&sum;
j (ra,j &minus; ra)(ri,j &minus; ri)&radic;&sum;
</p>
<p>j (ra,j &minus; ra)2
&sum;
</p>
<p>j (ri,j &minus; ri)2
(14.2)
</p>
<p>Note that the above correlation is computed over the items that both users
have evaluated. Hence, if there are only a few numbers of commonly rated
items, these correlations may be unreliable.
</p>
<p>Claiming its better performance, Shardanand and Maes (1995) have
proposed the following constrained Pearson correlation coefficient as the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.2 Memory-Based Methods 357
</p>
<p>similarity measure.
</p>
<p>sa,i =
</p>
<p>&sum;
j (ra,j &minus; 4)(ri,j &minus; 4)&radic;&sum;
</p>
<p>j (ra,j &minus; ra)2
&sum;
</p>
<p>j (ri,j &minus; ri)2
(14.3)
</p>
<p>They use 4 because it is the midpoint of their seven-point rating scale. How-
ever, there are no theoretically convincing reasons why 4 is better than the
mean ratings.
</p>
<p>Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient
</p>
<p>Herlocker et al. (1999) criticized the rather restrictive data assumptions re-
quired for the Pearson correlation coefficient and proposed Spearman rank
correlation coefficient as a similarity measure. The Pearson correlation coeffi-
cient can be cast in a regression framework that relies on several assumptions,
including that the relationship is linear and the error distribution has a mean
of 0 and constant variance. These assumptions are frequently violated in col-
laborative filtering data. Spearman rank correlation coefficient does not rely
on these model assumptions. It is identical to Pearson except that it computes
a measure of correlation between rank orders instead of rating values. There
has not been any significant performance difference observed between Pearson
and Spearman (Herlocker et al. 1999). However, these authors suggest using
Spearman rank correlation for a rating scale with a small number of discrete
values and Pearson correlation for the rating scale with continuous values.
</p>
<p>(Cosine) Vector Similarity
</p>
<p>Adopting the idea from information retrieval literature, Breese et al. (1998)
have proposed the cosine vector similarity measure. In information retrieval,
the vector of word frequencies characterizes each document and the angle
between two vectors of word frequencies measures the similarity between two
documents. Likewise, the similarity between the active user a and the other
user i is defined as
</p>
<p>sa,i = cos(ra, ri) =
ra &middot; ri
</p>
<p>‖ra‖ ‖ri‖ (14.4)
</p>
<p>where ra = (ra,1, ra,2, . . . , ra,J ), ri = (ri,1, ri,2, . . . , ri,J ), ra &middot; ri =&sum;J
j=1 ra,jri,j , ‖ra‖ =
</p>
<p>&radic;&sum;J
j=1 r
</p>
<p>2
a,j , and ‖ri‖ =
</p>
<p>&radic;&sum;J
j=1 r
</p>
<p>2
i,j . Note that the
</p>
<p>angle is calculated over items that both users have evaluated. Because of its
origin in the field of information retrieval, ratings below zero as well as the
unrated items receive zero rating values.
</p>
<p>The cosine vector similarity is mathematically similar to Pearson correla-
tion coefficient. However, Pearson correlation takes into account the differ-
ences in rating scale between different users (i.e., ri and ra, see Equation 14.2).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>358 14 Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>The cosine vector does not. The cosine vector similarity has been shown to
be successful in the field of information retrieval, but it does not perform well
compared to the Pearson correlation coefficient in the area of collaborative
filtering (Breese et al. 1998).
</p>
<p>14.2.1.2 Significance Weighting
</p>
<p>One critical problem that all similarity measures have in common is that
they do not consider the significance (or confidence) of the similarity mea-
sure. Does the correlation of 0.9 between two users tell you that two users are
very similar? It depends on the confidence attached to the correlation. If 0.9 is
calculated based on 100 co-rated items, we will trust the correlation and con-
clude that preference structures of two users are very similar. However, if the
correlation of 0.9 is based on five co-rated items, we may reserve our conclu-
sion because we are not sure whether 0.9 is the true correlation or results from
chance. That is, we need to recognize that the true similarity between users
is an unknown parameter. Since the calculated correlation is the estimate of
the true similarity, it is important to know the confidence of our estimate.
</p>
<p>Herlocker et al. (1999) have found that some users who correlated highly
with the active user did not perform well in predicting the preference ratings
of the active user. Those high correlations (with terrible predicting perfor-
mance) were frequently based on tiny sample sizes (often three to five co-rated
items). In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a weighting factor has
been proposed to add to the correlation such that the algorithm can discount
the correlations based on small samples. More specifically, if two users had
fewer than 50 co-rated items, Herlocker et al. multiplied the original correla-
tion by a significance weight of n/50 where n is the number of co-rated items.
For more than 50 co-rated items, a significance weight of 1 was uniformly
used. The authors showed that applying significance weighting improved the
prediction accuracy whether it is applied to Pearson or Spearman correla-
tion (Herlocker et al. 1999). However, they did not provide any theoretically
convincing reasons why they selected 50 as opposed to 10 or 100 as a cutoff.
</p>
<p>14.2.1.3 Variance Weighting
</p>
<p>Similarity measures discussed so far assume that all item ratings have the
identical informational value in predicting the preference of the active user.
However, researchers are beginning to recognize that preference ratings on
certain items are more important than others in identifying similarities among
users (Breese et al. 1998; Herlocker et al. 1999). For example, the item that
all users rate highly or badly is not very a useful piece of information in
differentiating users. On the other hand, the item that 50% of users rate very
positively and the rest rate very negatively tells us a lot about similarities
among users.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.2 Memory-Based Methods 359
</p>
<p>For treating the informational value of each item rating differently, Her-
locker et al. (1999) have proposed to incorporate the item-variance weight
factor into the calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient. More specif-
ically, first standardize each rating so that its mean is zero and its variance
is one. Then Equation 14.2 can be written as
</p>
<p>sa,i =
&sum;J
</p>
<p>j=1
za,jzi,j
</p>
<p>/
J (14.5)
</p>
<p>where za,j = (ra,j &minus; ra)/σa, zi,j = (ri,j &minus; ri)/σi and J is the number of
co-rated items. We now incorporate the item-variance weight factor into
Equation 14.5, the standardized Pearson correlation.
</p>
<p>sa,i =
&sum;J
</p>
<p>j=1
vjza,jzi,j
</p>
<p>/&sum;J
j=1
</p>
<p>vj (14.6)
</p>
<p>where vj = (σ2j &minus;σ2min)/σ2max, σ2j =
&sum;n
</p>
<p>i=1 (ri,j &minus; r̄j)2
/
(n&minus; 1), σ2min and σ2max
</p>
<p>are the minimum and maximum variances over all items.
It intuitively makes sense to incorporate the variance weighting in the
</p>
<p>similarity computation. Unfortunately, however, employing the item-variance
weighting factor did not show any significant gain in the prediction accuracy
(Herlocker et al. 1999).
</p>
<p>14.2.1.4 Selecting Neighborhoods
</p>
<p>Shardanand and Maes (1995) have observed that selecting a subset of users
instead of all possible users improved the prediction performance of collabo-
rative filtering. Adding a large number of users with correlations (similarity)
that were very low in magnitude seemed to increase the noise rather than
providing additional information in predicting the ratings of the active user.
Hence, they set an absolute correlation threshold so that only users with
absolute correlations (with the active user) greater than the threshold are se-
lected in computing Equation 14.1. An alternative way of selecting users with
high informational values is to pick the n users that correlate most highly
with the active user, where n is selected by the analyst (Herlocker et al. 1999).
</p>
<p>How do you choose a specific value for the correlation threshold or the
number n for the best n neighbors? Setting a high correlation threshold or
a small n will allow you to limit users to those with high correlations. How-
ever, setting too high correlation threshold or too small n makes your pre-
dictions less accurate because you are not drawing on the opinions of enough
neighbors. The magic number may have to be determined empirically for the
given study. Herlocker et al. (1999) have compared the performance of vari-
ous combinations of the correlation threshold and the best n neighborhood.
They found the best n method (with n = 20) provided the best performance
overall. Adding the feature of correlation threshold to the best n method does
not improve the performance of the best n method.</p>

<p>360 14 Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>14.2.2 Evaluation Metrics
</p>
<p>Research in collaborative filtering evaluates the performance of each algo-
rithm in terms of three metrics: coverage, statistical accuracy, and decision-
support accuracy (Sarwar et al. 1998).
</p>
<p>14.2.2.1 Coverage
</p>
<p>Coverage measures the percentage of items for which a collaborative filtering
algorithm can provide predictions. Since we evaluate algorithms of collabora-
tive filtering, item predictions of an active user should be made using other
users&rsquo; ratings to be included in coverage counting. We do not expect 100%
coverage because none of the users may rate certain items or similarities can-
not be computed for some users who do not rate any items in common with
the active user. As mentioned, applying the method of correlation thresholds
or the best n correlates will reduce coverage.
</p>
<p>14.2.2.2 Statistical Accuracy
</p>
<p>Statistical accuracy measures the closeness between the predicted and the
actual rating. Various metrics including mean absolute error, root mean
squared error and Pearson correlation coefficient can be employed in mea-
suring statistical accuracy. For more discussions on statistical accuracy, see
Chapter 11.
</p>
<p>14.2.2.3 Decision-Support Accuracy
</p>
<p>Decision-support accuracy measures how effectively predictions enhance a
user&rsquo;s ability to find items they like among the many choices in the full item
set. The user&rsquo;s decision is a binary process in many instances. For example, a
moviegoer will or will not watch the movie, Matrix. An Internet shopper will
or will not purchase a book from Amazon. However, as shown in Table 14.1,
the input data and the corresponding predictions are rating scores from 1
to 5. Hence, we need to convert the predicted rating scores into the binary
variable (0/1). Suppose a moviegoer watches the movies scored greater than
or equal to 4. Items with predicted scores of 4 or 5 are converted into the rec-
ommendation (1). Otherwise, items are converted into the recommendation
(0). We study two important metrics for decision-support accuracy.
</p>
<p>ROC Sensitivity
</p>
<p>The concept of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve originated in
the field of signal detection to measure the diagnostic power of a model (Swets</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.2 Memory-Based Methods 361
</p>
<p>Table 14.2 True event versus diagnosis &ndash; the basis for ROC curves (From Swets 1988)
</p>
<p>Event
</p>
<p>Positive Negative
</p>
<p>Diagnosis Positive True positive (a) False positive (b) a + b
</p>
<p>Negative False negative (c) True negative (d) c+ d
a+ c b+ d a+ b+ c+d&minus;N
</p>
<p>1988; see also Chapter 11). In order to understand this concept, let us take
a look at a two-by-two contingency table shown in Table 14.2. A diagnostic
system (or model) looks for a particular &ldquo;signal&rdquo; and ignores other events
called &ldquo;noise.&rdquo; The event is considered to be &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative,&rdquo; and
the diagnosis made is correspondingly positive or negative. There are two
ways in which diagnosis can be correct: &ldquo;true-positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;true-negative&rdquo;
in Table 14.2. And there are two cases that diagnosis can be wrong: &ldquo;false-
positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;false-negative.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The true-positive proportion, a/(a+ c), and the false-positive proportion,
b/(b+ d), captures all of the relevant information on accuracy of the model.
These two proportions are often called the proportion of &ldquo;hits&rdquo; and &ldquo;false
alarms.&rdquo;1 A good diagnostic model will provide many hits with few false
alarms.
</p>
<p>The ROC curve plots the proportion of hits versus false alarms for various
settings of the decision criterion (see Fig. 14.1). Going back to the movie
recommendation example, assume we set the rating threshold very high, say
4.9. We recommend the movie if the predicted preference rating is higher
than 4.9. We do not recommend otherwise. Given the rating threshold, we
can prepare the two-by-two contingency table after going through the filtering
algorithm for the entire database. The proportions of hits and false alarms
from the table will become a point of the ROC curve for the model. Now we set
the rating threshold a bit lower, say 4.8. And plot a point of the ROC curve.
Changing the value of the rating threshold to 0 will complete the ROC curve.
</p>
<p>Note an ROC curve is generated for a particular model as a function of a
critical decision criterion or parameter in the model, such as a cut-off. The
performance (or value) of the model is measured to be the area under the
ROC curve. The area varies from 0.5 to 1. The major diagonal in Fig. 14.1
represents the case of the area equal to 0.5 when the proportions of hits and
false alarms are the same. Random assignment will lead to the area of 0.5.
On the other hand, a perfect model when the curve follows the left and upper
axes has the area of 1. There are no false alarms with 100% hits. The realistic
model lies in between. The area under the curve increases as the model can
increase more hits while reducing the number of false alarms.
</p>
<p>1 The true positive proportion is also called &ldquo;sensitivity&rdquo; that is the probability of a ran-
domly selected positive event being evaluated as positive by the model. In addition, the
true negative proportion is often called specificity that is the probability of a randomly
selected negative event being evaluated as negative by the model. Note that the false
positive proportion is (1 &ndash; specificity).</p>

<p>362 14 Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>Fig. 14.1 The ROC curve (From Swets 1988).
</p>
<p>PRC Sensitivity
</p>
<p>Suppose that a movie prediction model recommends 100 titles and you like
50 of them, and another prediction model recommends 200 titles and you like
80 of them. Which movie prediction model is better? Researchers in infor-
mation retrieval have developed decision-support accuracy measures called
precision and recall to evaluate the model performance for cases as in this
example.
</p>
<p>Recall is the same as the true-positive proportion or the proportion of
hits in the ROC (e.g., a/(a + c) in Table 14.2). Precision is the number of
true-positives divided by the total number of positives diagnosed by the
model (e.g., a/(a+ b) in Table 14.2). Hence, precision indicates how selective
the system is, and recall indicates how thorough it is in finding valuable
information (Salton and McGill 1983). For example, suppose that the total
number of movies in movie database a user will like is 500 (e.g., a+ c = 500).
Suppose a model recommends 100 movies and the user likes 50 of them (e.g.,
a + b = 100 and a = 50). Then b = 50 and c = 450. Hence, the precision is
0.5 (= 50/100) and the recall is 0.1 (= 50/500).
</p>
<p>The PRC (precision-recall curve) plots recall versus precision for various
settings of the decision criterion. Similar to drawing the ROC curve, we
start with a very high rating threshold. Given the rating threshold, say 4.5,
we create the resulting two-by-two contingency table, calculate recall and</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.3 Model-Based Methods 363
</p>
<p>Fig. 14.2 The PRC (precision-recall curve).
</p>
<p>precision, and plot it on the PRC graph. Decreasing the value of rating
threshold gradually to zero, we can complete the locus of the PRC curve.
</p>
<p>For a given level of recall, we would like the precision to be as high as
possible. Therefore, the performance (or value) of the model is measured as
the area under the PRC curve. Its shape is different from the ROC curve
because of the different x-axis, as shown in Fig. 14.2. The area varies from 0
to 1. A perfect model with the area of one will have 100% precision for all
recall values. The random selection will produce the horizontal line with its
height determined by the proportion of actual positives in the entire samples.
The area under the curve increases as the model can increase the precision
for a given recall.
</p>
<p>14.3 Model-Based Methods
</p>
<p>Memory-based collaborative filtering has been widely used in practice be-
cause it is easy to implement. However, memory-based methods have several
limitations (Ansari et al. 2000; Sarwar et al. 2001). First, when data are
sparse, predictive accuracy becomes very poor. Many e-commerce sites such</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>364 14 Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>as Amazon.com carry a large number of products. Even heavy users in these
sites may have purchased well under 1% of the products. Because of low cover-
age, similarities (or correlations) between users are unreliable, and sometimes
cannot be computed. Second, memory-based methods require computations
that grow with both the number of customers and the number of products.
They will suffer serious scalability problem with millions of customers and/or
products. Model-based methods attempt to overcome these limitations of
memory-based methods.
</p>
<p>14.3.1 The Cluster Model
</p>
<p>Cluster models treat the recommendation problem as a classification task,
and identify groups consisting of users who appear to have similar prefer-
ences (Iacobucci et al. 2000). The segments are created using a clustering
algorithm in which the number of clustering variables is equal to the number
of items. When the number of items is too large, it is often recommended
to use only items that are rated (or purchased) by a minimum number of
users (or buyers). Once the segments are determined, cluster models assign a
target user to the segment containing the most similar users. Some clustering
algorithms classify the target user into multiple segments and calculate the
strength of each segment membership. Then the predicted preference for the
target user can be made by averaging the preferences of the other users in
the segment.
</p>
<p>Cluster models overcome the scalability problem of memory-based meth-
ods because they compare the target user to a small number of segments
rather than the entire customer base. However, cluster models provide less
personal recommendations than memory-based methods. Hence, the quality
of their predictions is often poor (Sarwar et al. 2001; Linden et al. 2003). Clus-
ter models overcome the scalability problem by grouping numerous users into
a small number of segments and treating all customers in the given segment
as the same in predictions. Increasing the number of segments may improve
the quality of prediction, but then the scalability problem comes in.
</p>
<p>14.3.2 Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>Unlike the memory-based collaborative filtering method that matches the
target user to similar users, item-based methods consider a set of items that
the target user has rated, calculate how similar they are to the target item,
and then combine those similar items into the prediction (Sarwar et al. 2001;
Linden et al. 2003). That is, item-based methods proceed in two steps: item
similarity computation and prediction computation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.3 Model-Based Methods 365
</p>
<p>The most critical step in item-based methods is to compute the similarity
between items and select the most similar items to the target item. The
similarity between item i and j (si,j) is calculated over the users who have
rated both items. For the data provided in Table 14.1, item-based methods
compute the similarity between movies (or columns) while memory-based
methods compute the similarity between users (or rows). There are several
ways to measure the similarity between items. Here we present two most
popular metrics: the Pearson correlation coefficient and the cosine vector
similarity.
</p>
<p>si,j =
&sum;
</p>
<p>u&isin;U (ru,i &minus; r̄i)(ru,j &minus; r̄j)&radic;&sum;
u&isin;U (ru,i &minus; r̄i)2
</p>
<p>&sum;
u&isin;U (ru,j &minus; r̄j)2
</p>
<p>(14.6a)
</p>
<p>si,j = cos(ri, rj) =
ri &middot; rj
</p>
<p>‖ri‖ ‖rj‖ (14.6b)
</p>
<p>In Equation 14.6a, U indicates the set of users who both rated item i and j,
ru,i is the rating of user u on item i and r̄i is the mean rating of item i over
users u &isin; U . In Equation 14.6b,
</p>
<p>ri = (r1,i, r2,i, . . . , rU,i), rj = (r1,j , r2,j , . . . , rU,j), ri &middot; rj
</p>
<p>=
&sum;U
</p>
<p>u=1
ru,iru,j , ‖ri‖ =
</p>
<p>&radic;&sum;U
u=1
</p>
<p>r2u,i, and ‖rj‖ =
&radic;&sum;U
</p>
<p>u=1
r2u,j .
</p>
<p>Once the similarity computations between items are completed, then the
predicted rating of item j for a target user u is given by the weighted
sum of ratings provided by the user on the items similar to the item j.
And similarities between items i and j (si,j) will measured by the Pearson
correlation coefficient or the cosine vector similarity. That is, the predicted
rating of item j for a target user u (r̂u,i) can be written as
</p>
<p>r̂u,j = ru +
I&sum;
</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>wi,j(ru,i &minus; ru) (14.7)
</p>
<p>In Equation 14.7, ru is a target user u&rsquo;s average rating across all I products
he or she has rated, and wi,j = si,j/ |
</p>
<p>&sum;
i si,j | is the weighted similarity of
</p>
<p>item i and item j. As a result, the user will receive a high prediction for item
j if the other items the user has rated tend to have high predictions and be
positively correlated with item j. In addition, similarities are scaled (e.g.,
wi,j) by the absolute sum of the similarities to make sure that the predicted
rating is within the predefined range.
</p>
<p>Sarwar et al. (2001) showed that item-based methods provided better
quality prediction than the memory-based algorithm across all sparsity lev-
els even though the difference was not significantly large. In addition, since
the item-similarity matrix is fairly static and can be created offline, their
online recommendation is fast even for extremely large data sets. Their</p>
<p/>

<p>366 14 Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>online speed of prediction does not depend on the total number of users,
but depends only on how many items the target user has rated. In sum,
item-based methods partially overcome the two challenging problems (data
sparsity and scalability) that memory-based methods often face in online
applications.
</p>
<p>14.3.3 A Bayesian Mixture Model by
Chien and George (1999)
</p>
<p>Chien and George (1999) were the first to propose a model-based ap-
proach based on a Bayesian mixture model. They pointed out a limitation
of memory-based methods that occurs when the number of co-rated items
from a pair of users is very small (e.g., problem of sparse data). This can
lead to high (but unreliable) similarity scores based on an extremely small
number of co-rated items. Significance weighting schemes discussed earlier
may alleviate this problem somewhat, but it is still heuristic. In addition,
memory-based methods are not based on a statistical model so that we
cannot statistically evaluate the uncertainty associated with the predicted
values.
</p>
<p>A Bayesian mixture model assumes that users who tend to give similar
ratings can be modeled as having the same ratings probability distribution.
That is, users can be partitioned into subgroups which are identified by com-
mon probability structure for the ratings. The prediction of a missing rating
is based on the posterior distribution of the groupings and associated ratings
probabilities. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with a hybrid
search algorithm are used to estimate parameters and obtain predictions of
the missing ratings. Chien and George (1999) show that their model outper-
forms memory-based methods both on two simulated data sets and a real
data. We do not describe their model in detail here because a hierarchical
Bayesian model in the next section overlaps with their model and is more
practical.
</p>
<p>14.3.4 A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach
by Ansari et al. (2000)
</p>
<p>Ansari et al. (2000) propose an effective hierarchical Bayesian model to pre-
dict missing ratings. They adopt a regression-based approach and model
customer (or user) ratings as a function of product (or item) attributes,
customer characteristics, and expert evaluations. Their model also accounts
for unobserved sources of heterogeneity in customer preferences and prod-
uct appeal structures. Specifically, customer i&rsquo;s rating on product j can be</p>

product attributes for product j. The random effects λi account for unob-
served sources of customer heterogeneity and appear in the model interac-
tively with the observed product attributes. Similarly, the random effects
γj represent unobserved sources of product attributes and appear in the
model interactively with the observed customer characteristics. The variance-
covariance matrices Λ and Γ provide the information about the extent of
unobserved heterogeneity in customer characteristics and product attributes,
respectively.
</p>
<p>Ansari et al. (2000) applied their model to the EachMovie data, which
is a popular movie rating database frequently used by collaborative filter-
ing researchers. Model parameters are estimated by Markov Chain Monte
Carlo. Their estimation results provided several interesting findings. First,
they compare the full model in Equation 14.8, the model with customer het-
erogeneity only, the model with product heterogeneity, and the model with-
out any heterogeneity at all. The full model outperforms all the other models
on various comparison criteria. They conclude that it is important to con-
sider both customer and product heterogeneity. In addition, accounting for
customer heterogeneity is more important than accounting for product het-
erogeneity. Second, they compared their hierarchical Bayesian model with
memory-based methods and showed that their model is substantially better
in rating predictions.
</p>
<p>The main contribution of Ansari et al.&rsquo;s method in collaborative filter-
ing research is to adopt a statistically formal approach. Unlike the memory-
based approach, their model can provide information on how accurate their
rating predictions are from the corresponding posterior distribution. In ad-
dition, their model can be used even when rating or preference data for an
item does not exist. For example, it can provide the predicted ratings for
a new movie, given data on its attributes and the characteristics of cus-
tomers (x, z, and w in Equation 14.8). Their model also has some advantages
over Chien and George&rsquo;s Bayesian mixture approach. Ansari et al.&rsquo;s model
explicitly incorporates explanatory variables (e.g., customer characteristics
and item attributes) so that it can explain why customers like or dislike
a product. Finally, Chien and George&rsquo;s Bayesian mixture assumes that all
customers in a given segment have the same preference structure. This as-
sumption can be restrictive in practice, and a large number of parameters are
required to be estimated. On the other hand, Ansari et al.&rsquo;s model employs
continuous heterogeneity so that each customer has his/her unique set of
preferences.</p>

<p>14.4 Current Issues in Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>For the last 10 years, a number of researchers have improved the algorithm
of collaborative filtering significantly. In addition, it has been commercially
incorporated in several web sites for many years now. However, we still have
a number of practical and theoretical issues to be resolved.
</p>
<p>14.4.1 Combining Content-Based Information
Filtering with Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>As shown, collaborative filtering is designed to solve the problem of making
accurate and efficient recommendations, that is, it is a recommendation &ldquo;en-
gine.&rdquo; There is an alternative method to approach the same problem: content-
based information filtering. Each method has its advantages and disadvan-
tages. This section will briefly study the content-based information filtering
and introduce recently developed techniques combining it with collaborative
filtering.
</p>
<p>14.4.1.1 Content-Based Information Filtering
</p>
<p>Content-based information filtering recommends items for users by analyzing
the content of items that they liked in the past (Balabanovic and Shoham
1997). Its underlying assumption is that the content of an item is what de-
termines the user&rsquo;s preference (Balabanovic 1997). We predict the item pref-
erences of an active user from the observed preferences from other users in
collaborative filtering. In contrast, content-based filtering does not use the
preferences of other users. Instead, its prediction is solely based on the con-
tent of an item and the historical preference of the active user.2
</p>
<p>Content-based methods have been widely used. E-mail filtering software
sorts e-mail into categories according to the sender and content of the ti-
tle. New-product notification services advertise a new book or album by the
user&rsquo;s favorite author or artist (Schafer et al. 1999). Search engines such as
Yahoo recommend relevant documents on the basis of user-supplied keywords
(Ansari et al. 2000).
</p>
<p>To show the main idea of the content-based filtering, let us define an item
as a vector X = (x1, . . . , xK) where each element xi is the content or the
attribute of the item. For example, an item can be a movie Matrix and its
</p>
<p>2 The hierarchical Bayesian approach by Ansari et al. (2000) models customer ratings
as a function of product (or item) attributes. Hence, it can be considered as content-
based methods. However, customer ratings in their model not only depend on product
attributes but also customer characteristics and expert evaluations. It is a hybrid method
to combine content-based methods and collaborative filtering.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.4 Current Issues in Collaborative Filtering 369
</p>
<p>contents may be its genre, its main actor/actress, its director, etc. An active
user has evaluated a set of items so that we observe their preference ratings
with their content information. For each user, the set of evaluated items will
be used as the estimation sample for the content-based filtering. That is, we
run a regression model r = f(x1, . . . , xK) for each user where r is the item
ratings. Once the model is estimated, we predict the preference ratings of
missing items for the active user.
</p>
<p>14.4.1.2 Combining Techniques
</p>
<p>Content-based filtering is an effective recommendation tool for new items
where rating information from other users does not exist. However, it also
has several limitations (Sarwar et al. 1998; Good et al. 1999). First, it often
provides bad recommendations since it only considers the pre-specified con-
tent of items. If two items have the same content, it will predict them to have
the identical ratings. Second, it tends to restrict the scope of the recommen-
dation to the similar items that consumers have already rated (Balabanovic
and Shoham 1997).
</p>
<p>In contrast, collaborative filtering overcomes the limitations of the content-
based filtering by enabling consumers to share their opinions and experiences
on items (Herlocker et al. 1999). It recommends items that similar consumers
have liked. It automates the process of word-of-mouth communication among
consumers. However, it also has its own limitations. First, collaborative fil-
tering does not work very well when the number of evaluators/users is small
relative to the volume of information in the system. That is, it is difficult to
find similar users in predicting ratings for some unpopular items. Second, it
has an early rater problem that occurs when a new product/item appears in
the database. Note that the collaborative filtering cannot provide the predic-
tive ratings for a new product until some consumers have evaluated it.
</p>
<p>Recognizing that the content-based and the collaborative filtering systems
both have their advantages and disadvantages in recommending products, re-
searchers have recently attempted to develop a hybrid model to combine these
two approaches (Balabanovic 1997; Balabanovic and Shoham 1997; Basu et
al. 1998; Sarwar et al. 1998; Good et al. 1999; Herlocker et al. 1999; Kim and
Kim 2001). Claiming that their models take advantage of the collaborative
filtering approach without losing the benefit of the content-based approach,
they have shown that their models performed better than the individual ap-
proach. We describe the hybrid model by Kim and Kim (2001).
</p>
<p>14.4.1.3 Hybrid Model by Kim and Kim (2001)
</p>
<p>Taking a statistically more formal approach than the other combining meth-
ods, Kim and Kim (2001) have developed a hybrid recommender system that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>370 14 Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>combines the content-based and the collaborative filtering systems. Their
point of departure is first to extract the content component of products/items
by employing a regression and then to apply the collaborative filtering to the
consumer&rsquo;s preference unexplained by this (content-based) regression. Specif-
ically, the authors apply a simple regression to extract item attributes and
then adjust upward or downward based on whether similar users have positive
or negative errors associated with the regression-based prediction.
</p>
<p>The Algorithm
</p>
<p>The algorithm consists of six major steps. First, the system needs to deter-
mine a set of content features to characterize products/items. For the movie-
goer example, key features may include the genre of the movie, the director,
the producer, the main actors/actresses and so on.
</p>
<p>The second step is to identify the relationship between item features and
preference ratings. They use a simple regression applied to each user.
</p>
<p>raj = β0a + β1aX1aj + . . .+ βaiXKaj + εaj (14.9)
</p>
<p>where raj is the preference rating of the active user a for item j,K is the
number of specified features and X1aj is the value of the 1st feature for prod-
uct j evaluated by the active user a. The parameters to be estimated (or
β&rsquo;s) in the Equation 14.9 measure how important each feature is in deter-
mining the preference of the user. Upon estimation, the model can predict
the active user a&rsquo;s preference on items not yet evaluated. For the moviegoer
example in Table 14.1, we would apply the regression with Amy&rsquo;s observed
movie preferences as a dependent variable and the corresponding movie fea-
tures as independent variables. Given the features of Movie 3, the estimation
model would be used to predict Amy&rsquo;s rating for Movie 3 that is not rated.
</p>
<p>Steps 1 and 2 are nothing but a version of content-based filtering. Only the
contents of items are utilized to predict the preferences of a user. Content-
based filtering cannot explain anything beyond item features. For example, a
user may provide different ratings for the two movies with identical features.
Many other factors than the specified item features will influence the prefer-
ence ratings. The unexplained portion of user ratings will be modeled in the
following steps.
</p>
<p>Steps 3 and 4 are required to derive the matrix of prediction errors. The
prediction error (εaj = raj &minus; r̂aj) is the difference between the actual pref-
erence and the predicted preference for user a, movie j. In other words, the
prediction errors are the residuals in regression model or the preferences un-
explained by the model. It is required to calculate the predicted ratings for
both observed and missing items. But the prediction errors for missing items
cannot be calculated. Hence, the data matrix of prediction errors consists of
a series of prediction errors with a set of missing values.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.4 Current Issues in Collaborative Filtering 371
</p>
<p>Step 5 is to apply the collaborative filtering technique to the prediction
error matrix. Kim and Kim (2001) have employed a typical neighborhood-
based algorithm to calculate the values for missing cells. Hence, the predicted
rating of an active user t on product j (et,j) can be calculated as
</p>
<p>ea,j = εa + τ
n&sum;
</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>sa,i(εi,j &minus; εi) (14.10)
</p>
<p>where and n is the number of users in the prediction error matrix who have
evaluated the item j. The weight sa,i is the (error) similarity between user i
and the active user a. And τ is a normalizing factor such that the absolute
values of the weights sum to one.
</p>
<p>The final step is to sum the outputs from the third step and the fifth step.
For the missing cells, the content-based filtering in step 3 provides r̂aj while
the collaborative filtering in step 5 produces eaj . The predicted rating of item
j for the active user a is the sum of these two numbers. Summarizing the
algorithm,3
</p>
<p>STEP 1: Determine a set of content features characterizing items.
STEP 2: Fit the (features) regression for each user.
STEP 3: Calculate the fitted preferences for all users and all items.
STEP 4: Derive a matrix of prediction errors.
STEP 5: Apply the collaborative filtering into the error matrix.
STEP 6: Sum the output from STEP 3 and STEP 5.
</p>
<p>Performance of the Model
</p>
<p>Kim and Kim&rsquo;s hybrid model is applied to the movie rating data. Four other
competing models are also applied to the data. The baseline model that pre-
dicts the rating for each movie as the mean rating across users will benchmark
the performance of the other personalized recommender systems. The second
model is a content-based filtering method where the genres of the movie are
used as the contents of the movie/item. A dummy variable is created for
each of the ten genre variables including comedy, drama, action, art/foreign,
classic, animation, family, romance, horror and thriller. A movie can be si-
multaneously classified into more than one of these genres. For each user,
actual movie ratings are regressed on these ten genre dummies. The third is
a collaborative filtering model using the neighborhood-based algorithm with
similarities between users measured by Pearson correlation coefficients. In
addition, twenty co-rated items are used as the cutoff for significance weight-
ing, and the users with less than 0.01 correlations are not included as a set
of neighborhood.
</p>
<p>3 A hybrid model by Kim and Kim (2001) has a same objective as a hierarchical Bayesian
approach by Ansari et al. (2000) in combining content-based methods and collaborative
filtering. Ansari et al.&rsquo;s approach is statistically more rigorous. However, it is much
easier to implement Kim and Kim&rsquo;s method.</p>

</p>
<p>Table 14.3 shows the prediction accuracy for five models in the validation
sample. Two performance measures are employed: the MAE and the ROC
sensitivity measure. As expected, models incorporating some personalized
components outperform the (aggregate) baseline model with respect to both
MAE and ROC. In addition, the hybrid model is shown to outperform all
other models for both prediction measures. With respect to the ROC, the
hybrid model improves the predictive performance of the content-based and
the collaborative filtering by 6.8% and 2.6%, respectively.
</p>
<p>14.4.2 Implicit Ratings
</p>
<p>So far we have limited our attention to case where we have preference rating
data explicitly expressed by users on a discrete numerical scale. In the real
world, however, explicit rating information is not always available. Often
the data available are behavioral measures such as the user&rsquo;s web-browsing
pattern, purchase history and so on. These data provide implicit ratings
of products. GroupLens research shows that predictions based on reading
time are nearly as accurate as predictions based on explicit numerical ratings
in the news article recommendation (Konstan et al. 1997). However, Mild
and Reutterer (2001) applied various versions of memory-based methods to
actual purchase choices and found poor predictive performance. Considering
its practical importance, the research on implicit ratings is relatively rare.
</p>
<p>It is not obvious how to develop an implicit score from customers&rsquo; purchase
histories. One cannot simply assign one for an item purchased and zero for
an item not purchased. A purchase of an item may imply that customer likes
it.4 But if an item has not been purchased, this might mean the customer
dislikes it or the customer does not know its availability, or something else.
Moreover, technically speaking, we cannot apply collaborative filtering to the
data filled with either 1 or 0. You need 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s with missing cells that
will be predicted.5
</p>
<p>4 Even this is debatable because purchase does not always imply the consumer liked the
product. CDNOW allows customers later to go back and say &ldquo;own it but dislike it&rdquo;
(Schafer et al. 1999).
</p>
<p>5 Sarwar et al. (2000) suggest that the frequency of purchases instead of purchase indicator
(e.g., one) can be used for repeat purchase products.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.4 Current Issues in Collaborative Filtering 373
</p>
<p>An easy way of overcoming the problem is to use the default voting
(Breese et al. 1998). The idea has been developed out of the observation
that, when users only rate a small number of items, the correlation algorithm
and neighbor-based collaborative filtering will not work well because it uses
only ratings of the items both users have rated. The authors suggest that
some default rating value is assigned for not-rated items such that the corre-
lation is calculated over the union of the rated items. They also suggest that
the same default value is assigned for some additional items k that neither
user has rated. However, Breese et al. (1998) did not provide any justification
on why some not-rated items should get default ratings and others should
not. More research is definitely required.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, Mild and Reutterer (2003) propose using the Jaccard or
Tanimoto coefficient as the similarity measure to overcome the limited vari-
ance in similarities constructed for very sparse binary purchase data. The
Tanimoto similarity between two users a and i (sa,i) is defined as
</p>
<p>sa,i =
the number of items that both users purchased
</p>
<p>the number of items that either user a or user i purchased
</p>
<p>That is, the Tanimoto similarity ignores the number of coinciding non-chosen
items. Mild and Reutterer (2003) show that the Tanimoto similarity outper-
forms traditional similarity measures in the case of extremely asymmetric
distributed or sparse data vectors (e.g., many zeros).
</p>
<p>Another approach would be to calculate simple correlations between 0 and
1 data for the similarity measure for item-based collaborative filtering as in
Sect. 14.3.2, Equation 14.7. That is, for each pair of items, we would calcu-
late the correlation across users between 0 and 1 data of whether or not they
purchased the product. That would provide the correlation needed in Equa-
tion 14.7. We would interpret a high correlation as meaning that customers
who buy one product tend to buy the other. So if the active customer has
purchased products that correlate positively with Product A, we would pre-
dict that the customer would be interested in purchasing Product A. This
of course is a simple, brute force approach that avoids the fact that we do
not know how to interpret the 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s (see Iacobucci et al. (2000) for a
criticism of the use of correlations between 0 and 1 variables), but is worthy
of future research because in all likelihood, the customer who has purchased
a specific product tends to like it. Using this theme in an item-based col-
laborative filtering system would essentially just be an extension of market
basket analysis (see Chapter 13), which looks at conditional probabilities of
purchasing one product, given another product has been purchased. This is
similar conceptually to the correlation that would be used in the item-based
collaborative filtering system based on 0&ndash;1 data.
</p>
<p>We may be able to increase the quality of data considerably by collecting
implicit data that imply negative user preference. For example, information
on returned products may indicate negative preference (Schafer et al. 1999).
Or customer complaints on products/services can be incorporated. However,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>374 14 Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>a really complex question on implicit negative preference may be how to
code/rate them. If 1 is for purchase and 0 for non-purchase, then what number
should be assigned to the implicit negative preference such as the product
return? Without any theoretical development, researchers have empirically
searched for the optimal value leading to the best prediction performance.
The better approach may be to construct the unobserved distribution of
customer preference on the product.
</p>
<p>Another issue on implicit ratings is how to combine the explicit and the
implicit rating. We might first derive the implicit preference ratings from
purchase histories. The rating database will be revised once the explicit rating
information is available. For example, Amazon.com users sometimes provide
explicit ratings on books they bought. It is an interesting future research
agenda to develop a concrete method of initializing ratings with implicit
rating information and updating them with explicit rating information.
</p>
<p>14.4.3 Selection Bias
</p>
<p>Most collaborative filtering algorithms assume that the missing data is gen-
erated randomly. However, customers can evaluate only products that they
have purchased. Or the set of movies rated by a moviegoer may be movies
that she tends to like. We do not know all possible causes of the missing
data pattern, but we know that most data employed in collaborative filtering
research has non-ignorable missing data pattern.
</p>
<p>If the missing evaluations are missing at random, we can safely assume that
the missing data does not have any informational value in rating predictions.
That is, the fact that the evaluation is missing does not depend on the value
of that evaluation, when the missing evaluations are missing at random (Ying
et al. 2006). But this assumption may be too restrictive in practice. Some
customers do not provide ratings simply because they have not purchased
the product in question. And the reason why they did not purchase the
product may be that they did not like it. Failing to incorporate missing-data
mechanism can lead to biased estimates unless the missing data is generated
completely at random (Little and Rubin 1987). That is, our rating predictions
can be suboptimal if we ignore missing-data mechanism.
</p>
<p>Ying et al. (2006) account for non-random missing data by proposing a
joint model for the latent processes underlying selection and prediction. In
their model, the fact that a product is &ldquo;selected&rdquo; for evaluation influences
the predicted rating of the product. More specifically, their selection and
prediction model can be written as
</p>
<p>Us = βsXs + εs
Up = βpXp + εp
</p>
<p>(εs, εp) &sim; N(0, 0, 1, 1, ρ)
(14.11)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14.4 Current Issues in Collaborative Filtering 375
</p>
<p>Similar to Ansari et al. (2000), they view product evaluations (or recommen-
dations) as a target customer&rsquo;s latent consumption utility. In Equation 14.11,
the subscript s indicates the selection component while the subscript p in-
dicates the prediction component. And X represents all covariates such as
product or customer characteristics.
</p>
<p>The selection equation in Equation 14.11 is the key to incorporate non-
random missing data mechanism. The latent value Us can be translated into
the observed quantity by assuming that P (Ys = 1) = P (0 &lt; Us) where
Ys is the 0/1 indicator representing whether the product is evaluated (see
Chapter 11 for more discussion of selection models). The correlation ρ, rep-
resenting the correlation between the error terms, is allowed to vary across
customers captures the interrelation between the selection and the prediction
processes.
</p>
<p>We can interpret Equation 14.11 as a two-step rating process even though
Ying et al. did not make any assumptions on temporal ordering of these
two processes. First, a customer will make a decision on whether the item
is evaluated (or purchased) according to the selection model. And then if
the selection decision is affirmative, s/he will make the rating decision. If we
ignore the selection model, the expected value for the prediction utility should
be E(Up) = βpXp. When the selection process is considered, it will change.
For example, suppose that a customer has decided to evaluate (e.g., rating is
not missing). Then the expected value for the prediction utility should be
</p>
<p>E(Up|Us &gt; 0) = βpXp + ρφ(βsXs)/Φ(βsXs) (14.12)
where φ(&middot;) and Φ(&middot;) are the density function and distribution function of
the standard normal evaluated at βsXs. That is, incorporating the selection
process changes the expected value for the prediction utility. It is also in-
teresting to note the role of the correlation ρ. If the selection process is not
correlated with the prediction process (e.g., ρ = 0), the expected value for
the prediction utility in Equation 14.12 becomes βpXp that is the same as
the expected value without the selection model.
</p>
<p>Applying their model into the EachMovie data, Ying et al. (2006) found
that the correlation ρ is significantly different from zero. Hence, the missing-
data generation process is not random. In addition, the inclusion of the se-
lection model clearly improves the prediction accuracy for the item ratings.
</p>
<p>14.4.4 Recommendations Across Categories
</p>
<p>Current recommendation systems are designed to recommend a set of items
from a single product category, whether their algorithms are based on collabo-
rative filter, content-based filtering, or combining approach. For example, the
recommendation system may select ten movies among thousands of movie ti-
tles. An interesting marketing issue may be the possibility of predicting item</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>376 14 Collaborative Filtering
</p>
<p>preference in one category based on the preference information from other
product categories. For example, consider an Internet store selling books and
CDs that attempts to develop a recommender system. One can construct two
separate recommendation engines, one of book customers and the other for
CD customers. This approach is somewhat limited in utilizing cross-category
information. Alternatively, ignoring category differences and treating all
items from books and CDs homogeneously, one may develop one recommen-
dation system. Even though this approach maximizes the use of customer
purchase information, it may lead to the prediction bias resulting from mix-
ing apples and oranges. Finally, we can think of a method somewhere between
these two extreme approaches. Acknowledging category differences, we can
still use cross-category purchase information in predicting customer behavior.
</p>
<p>One way of incorporating the category effect is to weight ratings differ-
ently in calculating similarities between customers and mean ratings. For
example, suppose there are two categories, books and CDs. When we predict
the preference ratings of books, we multiply the ratings of CDs by a factor
α and apply the collaborative filtering algorithm. If α is equal to zero, then
the approach becomes two separate recommendation engines. On the other
hand, if α is equal to one, it becomes the approach of ignoring cross-category
effects. If α is somewhere between, we are assuming that the importance of
CD purchase information is α times as much as that of book purchase in-
formation in predicting the preference rating of books. Similarly, when we
predict the preference ratings of CDs, we multiply the ratings of books by a
factor β and apply the collaborative filtering algorithm. That is, we can al-
low for any asymmetric effect in providing information. That is, the purchase
information on books may be valuable in predicting purchase preferences of
the same customer for CDs. At the same time, the purchase information on
CDs may not be very useful in predicting purchase preferences for books.
</p>
<p>How do we determine the values of α and β? A simple approach may be
to determine empirically. That is, try every possible value from 0 to 1, and
choose the ones that would provide the best prediction performance.</p>

<p>Discrete Dependent Variables and
Duration Models
</p>
<p>Abstract Probably the most common statistical technique in predictive
modeling is the binary response, or logistic regression, model. This model
is designed to predict either/or behavior such as &ldquo;Will the customer buy?&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Will the customer churn?&rdquo; We discuss logistic regression and other dis-
crete models such as discriminant analysis, multinomial logit, and count data
methods. Duration models, the second part of this chapter, model the timing
for an event to occur. One form of duration model, the hazard model, is par-
ticularly important because it can be used to predict how long the customer
will remain as a current customer. It can also predict how long it will take
before the customer decides to make another purchase, switch to an upgrade,
etc. We discuss hazard models in depth.
</p>
<p>Many database marketing phenomena we want to model are discrete. For
example, consider predicting the brand of car a customer will choose in an
upcoming car purchase. Or consider predicting which customers will respond
to a direct mail offer. The brand choice or the response to the offer may be
modeled to be a function of customer&rsquo;s demographic and purchase behavioral
characteristics. However, the dependent variable is categorical (i.e., an iden-
tification of a brand or a response indicator). These are discrete dependent
variables.
</p>
<p>This chapter will discuss various statistical models that are designed to
analyze discrete or what are also called qualitative dependent variables. We
start with models for a binary response including the linear probability model,
logit model (or logistic regression), probit model and discriminant analysis.
In the next section, we introduce models for multinomial response that gen-
eralize the binary response models. Next, we briefly study models specially
designed for count data, followed by the tobit model or censored regression.
Finally, we discuss hazard models appropriate for analyzing duration data.
The hazard model analyzes the time until an event occurs, so has both dis-
crete and continuous aspects.

<p>378 15 Discrete Dependent Variables and Duration Models
</p>
<p>15.1 Binary Response Model
</p>
<p>The dependent variable for the binary response model can take two
different values. For example, a consumer responds to the promotional event
(Y = 1) or will not (Y = 0). Or a customer purchases the firm&rsquo;s brand of
car (Y = 1) or a competitor&rsquo;s brand (Y = 0). The specific values (0/1) as-
signed to each outcome of the dependent variable are arbitrary since all that
matters is that we have a code for knowing which values of Y correspond
to which outcomes. So we can assign Y = 0 for the response to the promo-
tional event and Y = 1 for the non-response. Or it can be Y = &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for the
response and Y = &ldquo;No&rdquo; for the non-response.
</p>
<p>In order to clarify the following discussion, consider a credit scoring model
that has become a standard application for financial institutions deciding
whether to grant credit to customers. The goal of the credit scoring model
is to automate the credit-granting decision process by predicting the default
probability for each credit applicant. The consumer&rsquo;s future response will be
either default (Y = 1) or not default (Y = 0). Typically a customer&rsquo;s default
behavior/response is modeled to be a function of her demographic and credit-
related behavioral characteristics with a number of macro economic variables.
</p>
<p>15.1.1 Linear Probability Model
</p>
<p>Our goal is to model the default behavior of customer i. Let Yi to be the
default indicator variable for customer i that is assumed to be randomly
drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with a mean of pi. Hence, the probability
that Yi equals 1 is pi while the probability that it equals 0 is 1&minus; pi. That is,
</p>
<p>Yi =
{
1, P (Yi = 1) = pi
0, P (Yi = 0) = 1&minus; pi (15.1)
</p>
<p>Our dependent variable Yi will have a relationship with a set of independent
variables by assuming that pi is a function of the set of independent variables.
That is, we assume that pi = F (ββ&prime;Xi) where Xi is a vector of independent
variables for customer i (e.g., customer&rsquo;s credit-related variables) and ββ is a
corresponding parameter vector. Then E(Yi) = (1)(pi) + (0)(1 &minus; pi) = pi =
F (ββ&prime;Xi).
</p>
<p>The key issue in a binary response model is the specification of the link
function F . The simplest is to assume that F is linear, pi = F (ββ&prime;Xi) = ββ&prime;Xi.
Now since E(Yi|Xi) = ββ&prime;Xi, we can derive the following linear probability
model.
</p>
<p>Yi = ββ&prime;Xi + εi (15.2)
</p>
<p>where εi is the error term of customer i. A linear probability model is a
traditional regression model with a binary dependent variable Yi and a set</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.1 Binary Response Model 379
</p>
<p>of independent variables Xi. Consistent with the assumption for a classical
linear regression, the expected value of the error term is 0, which can be seen
in the following calculation:
</p>
<p>E(εi) = E(Yi &minus; ββ&prime;Xi) = pi(1&minus; ββ&prime;Xi) + (1&minus; pi)(0&minus; ββ&prime;Xi)
= pi &minus; piββ&prime;Xi &minus; ββ&prime;Xi + piββ&prime;Xi
= pi &minus; ββ&prime;Xi
= 0
</p>
<p>However, there are a number of shortcomings to the linear probability model.
First, the error term in Equation 15.2 will violate the homoscedasticity as-
sumption of classical linear regression model since Yi is a binary discrete
variable. Noting that εi can only take two values, 1&minus; ββ&prime;Xi with probability
of pi and &minus;ββ&prime;Xi with probability 1&minus;pi, we compute the variance of the error
term as:
</p>
<p>V ar(εi) = E(ε2i ) = pi(1&minus; ββ&prime;Xi)2 + (1&minus; pi)(&minus;ββ&prime;Xi)2 = ββ&prime;Xi(1&minus; ββ&prime;Xi)2
</p>
<p>That is, the variance is not homoscedastic, but varies with the values of inde-
pendent variables. The second problem associated with the linear probability
model is more serious. We refer to it as the &ldquo;unit interval&rdquo; problem. Since pi
is the probability that Yi = 1, its value should be bounded from 0 to 1. The
predicted value of p̂i = β̂β
</p>
<p>&prime;
Xi in the linear probability model is not guaranteed
</p>
<p>to be within the [0, 1] range. As a result, predictions can be impossible to
interpret as probabilities. In addition, the heteroscedasticity, if not corrected
for, can increase prediction error. Because of these shortcomings, the linear
probability model is becoming less frequently used in database marketing
even though it is computationally simple to use.
</p>
<p>Several researchers have discussed ways of overcoming the shortcomings
of linear probability models (Judge et al. 1985; Greene 1997). For example,
Goldberger (1964) suggested correcting the heteroscedasticity problem by
employing GLS (generalized least squares) estimation. Judge et al. (1985)
proposed an inequality-restricted least squares approach to overcome the unit
interval problem, however their remedies are sample-dependent.
</p>
<p>15.1.2 Binary Logit (or Logistic Regression) and
Probit Models
</p>
<p>A direct way to remedy the unit interval problem is to find a link function that
satisfies the [0, 1] constraint on pi. One such function is a cumulative density
function. The value of pi = F (ββ&prime;Xi) or the probability of Yi = 1 approaches
to 1 as the value of ββ&prime;Xi goes to the plus infinity while it approaches to 0
as the value of ββ&prime;Xi goes to the minus infinity (see Fig. 15.1). Even though</p>

</p>
<p>φ(t)dt = Φ(ββ&prime;Xi) (15.3b)
</p>
<p>where φ(&middot;) is the density of a standard normal distribution and Φ(&middot;) is the
corresponding cumulative density. The model is called a binary logit or logis-
tic regression model when the link function F is logistic, and a probit model
when F is the standard normal. The shape of the logistic distribution is very
similar to that of the normal distribution except in the tails, which are heav-
ier (Greene 1997). Hence, its estimation results are also similar. It is difficult
to show that the logistic is better (or worse) than the standard cumulative
normal on theoretical grounds. However, the binary logit model may be more
frequently used because of its mathematical convenience &ndash; once the logistic
regression has been estimated, Equation 15.3a provides a convenient formula
for calculating predicted probabilities. In contrast, the probit model requires
a table look-up of the normal distribution to calculate predicted probabilities,
as shown in Equation 15.3b.
</p>
<p>The binary logit and probit models are estimated using the method of
maximum likelihood. Each observation is treated as an independent random
draw from the identical Bernoulli distribution. Hence, the joint probability</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>[F (ββ&prime;Xi)]Yi [1&minus; F (ββ&prime;Xi)]1&minus;Yi (15.4)
</p>
<p>The estimation of the parameter vector ββ involves finding a set of parameters
to maximize the likelihood function, Equation 15.4. It is difficult to derive an
analytical solution for ββ because the likelihood function (except in the case
of the linear probability model) is highly nonlinear. Therefore, the estimates
ββ are found through an iterative search using Newton&rsquo;s BHHH method for
the logit or probit model (Berndt et al. 1974).
</p>
<p>Let us provide a simple example of the logistic regression model applied
to credit scoring. Again our objective is to predict the prospect&rsquo;s default
probability. For illustration, we assume that a customer&rsquo;s default likelihood is
a function of her or his annual income and marital status, even though there
are several other variables related to the default behavior. Annual income
x1 (measured in $1,000) is a continuous variable while marital status x2
is defined to be categorical (x2 = 1 if the customer is single, divorced, or
separated, and x2 = 0 otherwise). The logistic regression model is applied to
a sample of current customers whose default behaviors have been observed.
We code Yi = 1 if customer i defaults and Yi = 0 if not. The following
equation summarizes the estimation result.
</p>
<p>P (Yi = 1) =
e0.5&minus;0.01x1+1.1x2
</p>
<p>1 + e0.5&minus;0.01x1+1.1x2
=
</p>
<p>1
1 + e&minus;(0.5&minus;0.01x1+1.1x2)
</p>
<p>(15.5)
</p>
<p>Equation 15.5 indicates that there is a negative relationship between income
(x1) and default likelihood. A customer with higher income will have the lower
chance of default. On the other hand, there is a positive relationship between
marital status and the default probability. A customer who is single, divorced,
or separated will have the higher probability of default. More specifically, the
single customer with the income of $40,000 (x1 = 40 and x2 = 1) is predicted
to have a default probability of 0.08 while the married customer with the same
income (x1 = 40 and x2 = 0) is predicted to have 0.03 probability of default.
Hence, the marginal effect of the marital status x2 (at x1 = 40) is 0.05. This
is the difference in default probabilities between a married customer and a
single, divorced, or separated customer.
</p>
<p>An intuitive way to interpret an individual logit parameter (β) is to con-
sider the &ldquo;odds ratio&rdquo;. First, the odds of a yes response (Yi = 1) is de-
fined to be P (Yi = 1)/P (Yi = 0), i.e., the likelihood of the event happening
relative to not happening. For example, an odds of &ldquo;3&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;3
to 1 odds,&rdquo; means that the likelihood of defaulting is three times greater
than the likelihood of not defaulting. Second, the odds ratio is the ratio of
the odds when the independent variable equals Xi + 1 divided by the odds
when the independent variable equals Xi. Hence the odds ratio shows by</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>382 15 Discrete Dependent Variables and Duration Models
</p>
<p>what factor the odds change when the independent variable increases by one
unit.
</p>
<p>It can be shown using simple algebra that for logistic regression, the odds
ratio equals exp(β) &ndash; the exponentiation of a logistic regression parameter
tells us the factor by which the odds change per unit change in the corre-
sponding independent variable. For example, the coefficient for marital status
in Equation 15.5 is β = 1.1. Since exp(1.1) = 3, this tells us that the odds of
defaulting change by a factor of 3, which means an increase of 200%, if the
customer is single, devorced, or separated (x2 = 1) versus married (x2 = 0).
The coefficient for income is β = &minus;0.01. Since exp(&minus;0.01) = 0.99, that means
that the odds of defaulting change by a factor of 0.99, which means a decrease
by 1% ((1&minus; 0.99)&times; 100% = &minus;1%) per $1,000 increase in income.
</p>
<p>In order to compare the impact of variables measured in different units,
we can calculate the change in the odds per standard deviation change in
the independent variable. Let σ = the standard deviations of the indendent
variable of interest, then the odds ratio per standard deviation change can
be shown to equal exp(βσ). Hence if the standard deviation of income in our
data is $15,000, we have exp(&minus;0.01 &times; 15) = 0.86, so a standard deviation
increase in income on the odds of defaulting decreases the odds of defaulting
by 14% ((1&minus; 0.86)&times; 100% = &minus;14%).
</p>
<p>15.1.3 Logistic Regression with Rare Events Data
</p>
<p>Researchers have addressed problems in the statistical analysis of rare events
data using logistic regression or binary probit. In the social and epidemiolog-
ical sciences, there are dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events) than
zeros (non-events), for example in the analysis of wars, coups, presidential ve-
toes and infections by uncommon diseases. In database marketing, response
rates below 1% are not unusual. When applied to rare events data, logistic
regression or binary probit can under-estimate customer response probability.
</p>
<p>Statistically, the problem emerges from the fact that the statistical prop-
erties of linear regression models are invariant to the (unconditional) mean
of the dependent variable. But the same is not true for logistic regression or
binary probit (King and Zeng 2001). In fact, King and Zeng show that for
the logistic regression model, when the mean of a binary dependent variable,
or the frequency of events in the data, is very small, parameter estimates of
logistic regression become more biased and predicted response probabilities
become too pessimistic. There are two intuitive explanations for this. (1) King
and Zeng argue that in rare events data, there are plenty of values available
for the independent variables to understand the circumstances that cause a
non-event, however, there are far fewer to understand the circumstances that
cause an event. Those few values do not fully cover the tail of the logistic dis-
tribution, and so the model infers that there are fewer circumstances under</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.1 Binary Response Model 383
</p>
<p>which the event will occur, resulting in an under-estimate of the probability
the event occurs. King and Zeng show that the primary manifestation of this
is downward bias in the constant term of the logistic regression.1 (2) Para-
metric link functions such as those used for logit or probit lack flexibility.
Logit and probit models assume specific shapes of the underlying link func-
tion (see Fig. 15.1), implying a given tail probability expression that remains
invariant to observed data characteristics. As a result, these models cannot
adjust for the case when there are not enough observations to fully span the
range needed for estimating these link functions (see Kamakura et al. (2005)
for further discussion).
</p>
<p>The bias in logistic regression with rare events is potentially very impor-
tant because it suggests that taking predicted logistic response probabilities
literally under-estimates the actual likelihood of response. Too many cus-
tomers will be deemed unprofitable and the firm will incur an opportunity
loss by not contacting many customers who would have been profitable (a
&ldquo;Type II Error&rdquo; as described in Chapter 10, Sect. 10.3.5.4).
</p>
<p>Researchers have proposed three approaches to overcome the problem with
using logistic regression (or probit) to analyze rare events data. These are all
statistical approaches aimed at calculating unbiased individual-level predic-
tions. When applying predictive models at the n-tile level, it is practical to use
each n-tile&rsquo;s actual response rate as the prediction for customers in that n-tile
(see Chapter 10, Sect. 10.3.5.1). Turning now to the statistical approaches to
calculating unbiased individual-level predictions, the first is to adjust the co-
efficients and the predictions of the estimated logistic regression model. King
and Zeng (2001, p. 147) describe how to adjust the maximum likelihood
estimates of the logistic regression parameters to calculate &ldquo;approximately
unbiased&rdquo; coefficients, β̃. When the β̃&rsquo;s are inserted into the logistic equation
for a given customer&rsquo;s set of independent variables, Xi, the resulting pre-
diction is called π̃i. King and Zeng then derive the following adjustment to
predicting the probability of an event using logistic regression when events
are rare:
</p>
<p>P (Yi = 1) = π̃i + (0.5&minus; π̃i)π̃i(1&minus; π̃i)XiV ar(β̂)X &prime;i (15.6)
</p>
<p>where V ar(β̂) is the estimated variance/covariance matrix of the estimated
coefficients. First, since we are dealing with rare events data, π̃i will be small
and so predictions using Equation 15.6 are adjusted upwards. Second, to the
extent that we have a very large sample size, we have more information,
V ar(β̂) will be relatively small, and there is less need for adjustment.2
</p>
<p>1 King and Zeng note that logistic regression coefficients estimated using maximum like-
</p>
<p>lihood are biased but consistent. However, the bias tends toward zero if observations
</p>
<p>are randomly sampled and the percentage of events approaches 50%. This makes sense
</p>
<p>given our intuitive explanation for the bias.
2 Software for implementing these adjustments, called &ldquo;Zelig,&rdquo; is available at Professor
</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s website, http://gking.harvard.edu/stats.shtml. We thank Professor King for his
</p>
<p>insights on this issue and for making his software available.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>384 15 Discrete Dependent Variables and Duration Models
</p>
<p>A second approach to addressing the bias issue is &ldquo;choice-based sampling.&rdquo;
In choice-based sampling, the sample is constructed based on the value of
the dependent variable. For example, if we were constructing a predictive
model for customer churn, we would gather all the churners and all the non-
churners, then randomly select 10,000 churners and 10,000 non-churners. The
intuitive appeal of choice-based sampling is that we now have an equal (or at
least more well-balanced) number of churners and non-churners, so being a
churner is no longer a rare event. The problem is that choice-based sampling
may induce a selection bias regarding the independent variables because there
may be unobserved factors that systematically produce different distributions
of independent variables for churners and non-churners (King and Zeng 2001;
Donkers et al. 2003).
</p>
<p>As a result, choice-based sampling produces biased results and correc-
tions must be undertaken. One of the popular ones is &ldquo;Weighted Exogenous
Sampling Maximum-Likelihood&rdquo; (WESML), developed by Manski and Ler-
man (1977) (see Singh (2005) for an application). King and Zeng (2001)
propose a simpler technique they find is equivalent to other econometric so-
lutions, and show that it performs similarly to WESML, although acknowl-
edge that WESML can be more effective with large samples and with func-
tional form misspecification. The King and Zeng adjustment is only to adjust
the constant term in the maximum-likelihood-estimated logistic regression
model:
</p>
<p>β̂0,adj = β̂0 &minus; ln
[(
</p>
<p>1&minus; τ
τ
</p>
<p>)(
ȳ
</p>
<p>1&minus; ȳ
)]
</p>
<p>(15.7)
</p>
<p>where β̂0,adj is the adjusted constant term, β̂0 is the MLE estimate of the
constant term, τ is the percentage of &ldquo;1&rsquo;s&rdquo; (i.e., churn, respond, etc.) in
the population, and ȳ is the fraction of 1&rsquo;s in the choice-based sample. For
example, τ might equal 2% but ȳ could equal 50%. One can see that since
τ &lt; ȳ, the adjusted constant term will be smaller than the MLE-estimated
constant term.
</p>
<p>Donkers et al. (2003) investigated the similar issue and derived the adjust-
ment factor to the constant term of the logistic regression. Their adjustment
formula is identical to Equation 15.7 except that they did not consider the
population (or prior) percentage. That is, β̂0,adj = β̂0 &minus; ln[y/(1&minus; y)].
</p>
<p>Research is needed to investigate WESML as well as King and Zeng&rsquo;s
adjustment in a database marketing context, and to find the conditions under
which random sampling (with King and Zeng&rsquo;s adjustment Equation 15.6) is
preferred to choice-based sampling (with either King and Zeng&rsquo;s adjustment
Equation 15.7 or WESML). See Ben-Akiva et al. (1997) for further discussion
and cautions regarding choice-based sampling.
</p>
<p>A third approach to addressing the rare-events problem is to relax the logit
or probit parametric link assumptions, which can be too restrictive for rare
events data (Bult and Wansbeek 1995; Naik and Tsai 2004). Naik and Tsai
(2004) proposed an isotonic single-index model and developed an efficient</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.1 Binary Response Model 385
</p>
<p>algorithm for its estimation. Different from the logistic regression or probit
model, its link function is flexible so that it encompasses all proper distrib-
ution functions and identifies the underlying distribution using information
in the data rather than imposing a particular shape. More work is needed to
investigate Naik and Tasi&rsquo;s method in a database marketing context.
</p>
<p>15.1.4 Discriminant Analysis
</p>
<p>Database marketers frequently use discriminant analysis as an alternative
to logistic regression or probit in analyzing binary response data. Discrim-
inant analysis is a multivariate technique identifying variables that explain
the differences among several groups (e.g., respondents and non-respondents
to mailing offers) and that classify new observations or customers into the
previously defined groups.
</p>
<p>Discriminant analysis involves deriving linear combinations of the indepen-
dent variables (ββ&prime;X) that will discriminate between a priori defined groups
(e.g., responders and non-responders). The weights, called discriminant co-
efficients, are estimated in such a way that the misclassification error rates
are minimized or the between-group variance relative to the within-group
variance is maximized. Once the discriminant weights ββ are determined, the
discriminant score (yi = ββ&prime;xi) for each customer i can be obtained by mul-
tiplying the discriminant weight associated with each independent variable
by the customer&rsquo;s value on the independent variable and then summing over
the set of independent variables. The resulting score for each customer can
be transformed into a posterior probability that gives the likelihood of the
customer belonging to each group.
</p>
<p>We apply the discriminant analysis into the credit scoring data in the pre-
vious section where a logistic regression was applied. The dependent variable
is binary (i.e., Yi = 1 if customer i defaults and Yi = 0 if not). And there
are two independent variables, annual income x1 and marital status x2. The
discriminant function (d) is estimated to be d = &minus;0.02x1 + 1.87x2. That is,
the discriminant coefficient is &minus;0.02 for x1 and 1.87 for x2. Among defaulters
whose Yi is equal to 1, the mean value of x1 is 30 and the mean of x2 is 0.7.
Among non-defaulters whose Yi is equal to 0, the mean value of x1 is 50 and
the mean of x2 is 0.3. Hence, the average discriminant score of defaulters is
ddefaulters = (&minus;0.02)(30)+(1.87)(0.7) = 1.249 while the average discriminant
score of non-defaulters is dnon-defaulters = (&minus;0.02)(50) + (1.87)(0.3) = 0.469.
A single customer with annual income of $40,000 is classified as a defaulter
because her or his discriminant score is (&minus;0.02)(40)+(1.87)(1) = 1.79, which
is greater than the midpoint of ddefaulters and dnon-defaulters(= 0.859).
</p>
<p>There are many studies on the relative performance of logistic regression
and discriminant analysis in the analysis of binary dependent variables. In
terms of computational burden, discriminant analysis is better. Ordinary</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>386 15 Discrete Dependent Variables and Duration Models
</p>
<p>least squares can be used to estimate the coefficients of the linear discrimi-
nant function, while nonlinear optimization methods are required to estimate
the coefficients of the logistic regression (Maddala 1983). However, computa-
tional simplicity is no longer an adequate criterion, considering the high-speed
computers available now.
</p>
<p>Amemiya and Powell (1983) found that if the independent variables are
multivariate normal, the discriminant analysis estimator is the maximum-
likelihood estimator and is asymptotically efficient. On the other hand, the
discriminant analysis estimator is not consistent when the independent vari-
ables are not normal, but the logistic regression is and therefore more robust.
Press and Wilson (1978) compared the performances of these two estima-
tors in terms of the number of correct classification when the independent
variables were dummy variables, and thus the assumption of normality was
violated. They found that the logistic regression did slightly better than dis-
criminant analysis.
</p>
<p>15.2 Multinomial Response Model
</p>
<p>Multinomial response models generalize binary response models to the situ-
ation of more than two possible outcomes or choice alternatives. Hence, the
dependent variable for the multinomial response model takes more than two
values. For example, consider a customer&rsquo;s choosing a brand of a car among
J alternative brands. The consumer response will be the choice of the first
brand (Y = 1), the second brand (Y = 2), or the Jth brand (Y = J).
</p>
<p>It is much more complex to estimate multinomial response models than
binary response models. However, the fundamental concepts, including the
interpretation of results are identical. Marketers have frequently employed
a multinomial logit model in analyzing multinomial response (or choice)
data because it is mathematically more tractable. However, the multinomial
logit fundamentally has a structural problem called the IIA (Independence of
Irrelevant Alternatives) property (Maddala 1983; Hausman and McFadden
1984). The multinomial probit model avoids the IIA problem but it is com-
putationally intense. More recently, McCulloch and Rossi (2000) proposed
a simulation-based estimation technique called Gibbs sampling to overcome
the computational problem of the multinomial probit model.
</p>
<p>A multinomial logit is similar to a binomial logit, except that the number
of choice (or response) alternatives is J . So we consider a consumer facing a
choice problem among J alternatives. Then the probability of the consumer
i&rsquo;s choosing alternative j can be written as:
</p>
<p>P (Yij = j) = exp(ββ&prime;xij + α&prime;jzi)/
J&sum;
</p>
<p>k=1
</p>
<p>exp(ββ&prime;xik + α&prime;kzi) (15.8)</p>

<p>where zi represents a set of independent variables describing characteristics
of customer i (e.g., consumer&rsquo;s income), xij are a set of independent variables
representing the attributes of alternatives (e.g., price of brand j faced by the
customer i), and ββ and α are parameters to be estimated. The alternative
specific parameters αj indicate that the effect of an independent variable is
different across different alternatives.
</p>
<p>Multinomial response models have rarely been employed in database mar-
keting. The reason may be that database marketers do not usually have com-
petitors&rsquo; data (e.g., which competitor&rsquo;s brand to choose). They only observe
whether customers do or do not purchase their products (or react/no react
to their promotional offers). However, there are some database marketing
problems in which a multinomial response model can be useful.
</p>
<p>Gensch et al. (1990) used customer research and the multinomial logit
model to understand the preferences and the decision-making processes
of ABB Electric&rsquo;s customers. ABB sold medium-sized power transformers,
breakers, switchgear, relays, etc., to electric utilities in the North American
market, and its major competitors included General Electric, Westinghouse,
McGraw&ndash;Edison, and so on. Gensch et al. identified 8 attributes that cus-
tomers used to select among 7 alternative suppliers including ABB. The
multinomial logit (Equation 15.8) was applied to evaluate which attributes
were the most salient or key in determining the choice among 7 suppliers.
Table 15.1 illustrates the output of the multinomial logit. It indicates that
warranty, energy losses and appearance are the key variables in determining
which supplier to purchase from. Gensch et al. also found that the salient
attributes identified by the logit model are quite different from the attributes
customers say are most important in their choice.
</p>
<p>As mentioned, multinomial logit has not been used frequently in database
marketing. However, we can think of several situations where the multino-
mial logit can be useful. Suppose that we classify current customers into J
clusters (or segments) using cluster analysis. We can apply the multinomial
logit with segment membership of each customer serving as the dependent
variable. The estimated multinomial logit model can be used to identify the</p>
<p/>

<p>388 15 Discrete Dependent Variables and Duration Models
</p>
<p>segment membership of potential customers. In addition, a multinomial logit
model can be valuable when database marketers attempt to predict what
products their customers will purchase. For example, insurance salesperson
wants to know which products (e.g., term insurance, endowment insurance,
and accident death benefits) the customer would be likely to buy when the
salesperson needs to decide which products to cross-sell.
</p>
<p>15.3 Models for Count Data
</p>
<p>Some dependent variables are not categorical, but are discrete with an or-
dered metric. For example, the number of beers a consumer drinks in a week
can be 0, 1, 2, and so on. Another example may be the number of mail orders
a customer makes in a year. A multinomial logit model will not be appro-
priate because the dependent variable is ordered. One may apply a classical
linear regression. But if there are many small numbers in the data, the dis-
crete characteristic of the data will be prominent. As a result, the classical
linear regression, which assumes a normal error term and hence a continuous
dependent variable, may not work well either.
</p>
<p>15.3.1 Poisson Regression
</p>
<p>Let Yi to be the value of the dependent variable for customer i. The Poisson
regression model assumes that each Yi(i = 1, 2, . . ., n) is a random variable
independently drawn from a Poisson distribution with parameter λi. Its prob-
ability density function is
</p>
<p>P (Yi = yi) = λ
yi
i exp(&minus;λi)/yi! yi = 0, 1, 2, . . . . (15.9)
</p>
<p>The dependent variable Yi will have a relationship with a set of independent
variables specified by a link function. The log-linear link function is frequently
used in Poisson regression. That is,
</p>
<p>lnλi = ββ&prime;Xi (15.10)
</p>
<p>where Xi is a vector of independent variables for customer i and ββ is a
corresponding parameter vector. It can be shown that the mean equals the
variance for the Poisson distribution. That is:
</p>
<p>E(Yi|Xi) = V ar(Yi|Xi) = λi = exp(ββ&prime;Xi)
The Poisson regression model is typically estimated by the method of maxi-
mum likelihood. Its log-likelihood function with the sample size of n can be
written as</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.3 Models for Count Data 389
</p>
<p>lnL(ββ|Yi, Xi) =

</p>
<p>Yi(ββ&prime;Xi)&minus;
&sum;
i
</p>
<p>exp(ββ&prime;Xi)
</p>
<p>(15.11)
Parameters will be estimated by finding ββmaximizing the log-likelihood func-
tion in the Equation 15.11. Similar to the logit and probit, the log-likelihood
function of the Poisson regression model is nonlinear and, hence, there is no
analytical solution. An iterative search routine such as Gauss&ndash;Raphson can
be applied to find the optimal solution.
</p>
<p>15.3.2 Negative Binomial Regression
</p>
<p>The Poisson regression model is often criticized because of its implicit as-
sumption that the mean of the Poisson distribution is the same as its vari-
ance. There are a number of tests available (called tests for overdispersion)
to determine whether this assumption is valid (Greene 1997). A number of
researchers have found the assumption to be violated (Hausman et al. 1984;
McCulloch and Nelder 1983). In that case, a more flexible model should be
applied. A number of researchers have proposed several approaches to extend
the Poisson regression model. We briefly discuss the most popular extension
called a negative binomial regression.
</p>
<p>Let the λi parameter of the Poisson distribution equal δiui where δi is the
component observable to the researcher (ln δi = ββ&prime;Xi) and ui is the random
error or the term for explaining unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity, that
is, differences between customers that are not explicitly measured by the
researcher. Hence, lnλi = ln δi + lnui = ββ&prime;Xi + lnui. Then the conditional
distribution of Yi, given ui, is Poisson with mean and variance of λi = δiui.
That is,
</p>
<p>P (Yi = yi|ui) = λyii exp(&minus;λi)/yi! = (δiui)yi exp(&minus;δiui)/yi! (15.12)
The unconditional distribution is simply the expected value of the conditional
distribution integrated over the conditioning variable ui. That is,
</p>
<p>P (Yi = yi) =
&int; &infin;
0
</p>
<p>[(δiui)yi exp(&minus;δiui)/yi!]g(ui)dui (15.13a)
</p>
<p>The choice of the density of ui will determine the form of the unconditional
distribution. For mathematical convenience, a gamma distribution is gener-
ally assumed for the density of ui. Then the unconditional density of Yi in
Equation 15.13a becomes the density of the negative binomial distribution:
</p>
<p>P (Yi = yi) =
Γ(θ + yi)
</p>
<p>Γ(yi + 1)Γ(θ)
</p>
<p>[
δi
</p>
<p>δi + θ
</p>
<p>]yi [
1&minus; δi
</p>
<p>δi + θ
</p>
<p>]θ
(15.13b)
</p>
<p>The negative binomial distribution in Equation 15.13b has a mean of δi and
a variance of δi(1 + δi/θ). In contrast to the Poisson regression, the mean is
different from the variance.</p>

<p>390 15 Discrete Dependent Variables and Duration Models
</p>
<p>Models for count data have not been used in database marketing. However,
there are situations in which they could be useful. Econometricians used count
models for the number of accidents on a natural-gas pipeline, the number of
patents issued and so on. Similar database marketing examples include the
number of customer complaints, the number of returns, and the number of
responses to direct marketing offers.
</p>
<p>We can easily fit Poisson regression and the negative binomial regression
models using the SAS GENMOD procedure.
</p>
<p>15.4 Censored Regression (Tobit) Models
and Extensions
</p>
<p>The dependent variables of our interest in database marketing often are cen-
sored. As defined by Wooldridge (2002, p. 517), &ldquo;censored regression models
generally apply when the variable to be explained is partly continuous but
has positive probability mass at one or more points.&rdquo; A simple example is
monthly expenditures from a catalog firm&rsquo;s customers. Expenditures are con-
tinuous, but there will be several customers who spend no money during a
particular month. Hence expenditures is a continuous dependent variable but
has a positive probability mass at zero, and has no observations less than zero.
</p>
<p>This can be modeled using a (Type I) Tobit model as follows: Define
y&lowast;i as a latent variable that reflects customer i&rsquo;s propensity for spending
money on the firm&rsquo;s product in a given time period. Consider a sample of
size n, (y&lowast;1 , y
</p>
<p>&lowast;
2 , . . . , y
</p>
<p>&lowast;
n). Those observations of y
</p>
<p>&lowast; &le; c will be recorded as
the value c (c is usually zero as in the case of expenditures). The resulting
sample of observations y1, y2, . . ., yn is said to be a censored sample. Note
that yi = y&lowast;i if y
</p>
<p>&lowast;
i &gt; c and yi = c otherwise.
</p>
<p>One might proceed by estimating yi as a function of various independent
variables using OLS regression. However, Wooldridge (2002, pp. 524&ndash;525)
shows that the resulting estimates will be inconsistent, whether we use all n
observations or just those for which yi &gt; 0. The problem is that OLS does not
account for the underlying censoring process. The regression model specially
designed to analyze the censored sample is the censored regression (or Tobit)
model can be written as:
</p>
<p>y&lowast;i = ββ
&prime;xi + εi (15.14a)
</p>
<p>yi =
</p>
<p>{
0 if y&lowast;i &le; 0
y&lowast;i if y
</p>
<p>&lowast;
i &gt; 0
</p>
<p>(15.14b)
</p>
<p>Equation 15.14a shows that a latent variable follows a usual regression model,
with error term εi having mean zero and variance σ2, while Equation 15.14b
shows that the dependent variable we observe can only be non-negative. Our
problem is to estimate ββ and σ2 using n observations of yi and xi. This</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.4 Censored Regression (Tobit) Models and Extensions 391
</p>
<p>model is first studied by Tobin (1958). Because he related his study to the
literature on the probit model, his model was nicknamed the Tobit model
(Tobin&rsquo;s probit). If there are no censored observations, E(yi) = E(y&lowast;i ) =
ββ&prime;xi and a classical regression model can be applied. However, with censored
observations, E(yi) is no longer equal to ββ&prime;xi. Restricting our attention to
non-censored observations, we get
</p>
<p>E(yi|yi &gt; 0) = ββ&prime;xi + E(εi|εi &gt; &minus;ββ&prime;xi) = ββ&prime;xi + σ φiΦi (15.15)
</p>
<p>where φi and Φi are the density function and distribution function of the
standard normal evaluated at ββ&prime;xi/σ. We can see that xi is correlated with
φi/Φi because φi and Φi are both functions of xi and hence if we run an OLS
regression as a function just of xi, we obtain biased and inconsistent results
due to omitted variables bias. If we use all observations, we get
</p>
<p>E(yi) = P (yi &gt; 0)E(yi|yi &gt; 0) + P (yi = 0)E(yi|yi = 0)
= Φi(ββ&prime;xi + σ
</p>
<p>φi
Φi
</p>
<p>) + (1&minus; Φi)(0) = Φiββ&prime;xi + σφi
(15.16)
</p>
<p>Still, an OLS regression will yield biased results because xi is correlated with
φi.
</p>
<p>The Type I Tobit Model can be estimated using maximum likelihood
(Wooldridge 2002, pp. 525&ndash;527). This can be done in SAS using Proc LIF-
EREG or QLIM.
</p>
<p>An important extension of the Type I Tobit is to model the process by
which a customer purchases at the level c (0) or greater. For example, we may
want to model which types of customers are likely to buy in a given month,
and if so, how much do they spend. This can be formulated as follows:
</p>
<p>y&lowast;i = ββ
&prime;xi + εi (15.17a)
</p>
<p>yi =
</p>
<p>{
0 if y&lowast;i &le; 0
y&lowast;i if y
</p>
<p>&lowast;
i &gt; 0
</p>
<p>(15.17b)
</p>
<p>z&lowast;i = α
&prime;wi + ui (15.17c)
</p>
<p>zi =
</p>
<p>{
1 if z&lowast;i &gt; 0
0 if z&lowast;i &le; 0
</p>
<p>(15.17d)
</p>
<p>The probit model (Equations 15.17c and 15.17d) determines whether the cus-
tomer buys in a given period, and if so, Equations 15.17a and 15.17b deter-
mine how much the customer spends. Note that expenditures are observed
only if the customer buys, but we acknowledge through the Type I Tobit
component that when a customer buys, he or she must spend at least $0.
Crucial to the formulation is that the error term ui of the probit is corre-
lated with the error term of the Type I Tobit (εi). This introduces additional
&ldquo;selectivity bias&rdquo; into the estimation of Equation 15.17a if not accounted for.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>392 15 Discrete Dependent Variables and Duration Models
</p>
<p>This model is estimable in LIMDEP using a two-stage maximum likelihood
procedure (Greene 2002, p. E23.18).
</p>
<p>A variation of Equation 15.17 is not to include the censoring restriction
15.17b (e.g., see Greene 2002, p. 710). This might be applicable if the depen-
dent variable can be positive or negative, such as the case if we are looking at
customer profitability. Many authors refer to this as a Type II Tobit model
(e.g., Wooldridge 2002, p. 562). This model can also be estimated within
LIMDEP (Greene 2002, pp. E23-1&ndash;E23-5).
</p>
<p>Another related model is where there is selectivity, but data are observed
for all customers, so the selection variable can be an independent variable
in the regression model. The example would be the case where we wanted
to determine if Internet usage affects customer profitability, but wanted to
recognize that only certain customers &ldquo;self-select&rdquo; into using the Internet.
The model would be:
</p>
<p>Yi = β&prime;Xi + δzi + εi (15.18a)
z&lowast;i = α
</p>
<p>&prime;wi + ui (15.18b)
</p>
<p>zi =
</p>
<p>{
1 if z&lowast;i &gt; 0
0 if z&lowast;i &le; 0
</p>
<p>(15.18c)
</p>
<p>This is a recursive model (w determines whether the customer uses the Inter-
net via Equations 15.18b and 15.18c, and then using the Internet determines
customer profitability via Equation 15.18a. The only difference between this
model and a standard linear recursive model is that whereas traditional re-
cursive models consist of two or more linear equations, each one feeding into
the next, the case here is a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; recursive model, where one equation
is a nonlinear discrete variable model, a probit, and the second equation is
a linear model. OLS estimation of Equation 15.18a will be biased if ε and
u are correlated, because that will set up a correlation between z and ε.
Greene (2002, p. E23-14) describes this model and how to estimate it within
LIMDEP.
</p>
<p>The above models (Equations 15.16&ndash;15.18) are very relevant for database
marketing, but there are few applications to date. An exception is the study
by Reinartz et al. (2005) which is discussed in Chapter 26. They present a
variation of Equation 15.17, where the probit model determines the acquisi-
tion (or selection) process and two (censored) regressions characterize rela-
tionship duration and customer profitability. They use their model to balance
resources between customer acquisition and retention efforts.

<p>15.5 Time Duration (Hazard) Models 393
</p>
<p>each customer in a month? Are attrition probabilities different depending on
the customer&rsquo;s demographic characteristics? What is the expected duration
of a customer&rsquo;s relationship with the firm? These questions can be addressed
using time duration models, specifically the statistical technique called haz-
ard modeling. We first discuss the characteristics of duration data. Then we
discuss and criticize a traditional approach such as a logit model to analyze
duration data. Finally, we introduce the hazard model specially designed to
analyze duration data.
</p>
<p>15.5.1 Characteristics of Duration Data
</p>
<p>In order to understand the characteristics of duration data, let us consider an
example of ABC newspaper. It has a database of its subscriber lists and keeps
the records of subscribers who are or have been customers at least a month
for the last 7 years. We randomly select 1,000 subscribers out of the database
to study their purchase behavior. Figure 15.2 displays how long some of these
customers have subscribed the ABC newspaper. We can exactly calculate the
duration of subscription for some customers including Customers 1, 2 and 3
because they no longer subscribe the ABC newspaper. On the other hand,
those customers such as Customers 4 and 1,000 still subscribe to the ABC
newspaper. The duration information provided by these current customers
is incomplete. We know when they began to subscribe, but we do not know
when they stop. For example, we know that customer 4 has subscribed to the
ABC newspaper for a year so far, but we do not exactly know how longer she
will stay. The data are right-censored.
</p>
<p>Fig. 15.2 Duration data for the ABC newspaper</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>394 15 Discrete Dependent Variables and Duration Models
</p>
<p>The ABC newspaper recognizes that the concept of customer&rsquo;s lifetime
value is important for its successful operations and customer retention is a
critical component of customer&rsquo;s lifetime value. Hence, the ABC newspaper
develops a model to understand factors determining a customer&rsquo;s subscription
duration and forecasts how long each of the current and potential customers
will stay. Based on this analysis, the ABC newspaper plans to develop various
acquisition and retention strategies. The question is, what is the appropriate
model?
</p>
<p>15.5.2 Analysis of Duration Data Using a Classical
Linear Regression
</p>
<p>The classical regression model may be the simplest way to explain the rela-
tionship between the customer&rsquo;s subscription duration and her demographic
characteristics (income, education, age, etc.). We might eliminate the incom-
plete (right-censored) observations &ndash; they are current customers &ndash; from the
estimation because they will bias downward the mean duration since those
observations actually have longer durations. Limiting our estimation sam-
ple only to non-current customers, we fit the regression model where the
subscription duration of each customer is the dependent variable and the
corresponding demographic characteristics are the independent or predictor
variables.3
</p>
<p>We apply the linear regression to the sample of previous customers with
two customer characteristics, annual income (measured in thousand dollars)
and sex (coded 1 if male and 0 if female customer). The estimated regression
line is
</p>
<p>Subscription duration = &minus;1 + 0.2&times; Income + 0.5&times; Sex (15.19)
</p>
<p>This regression line allows us to predict the expected subscription duration
of a customer given his or her income and sex. The expected subscription
duration for a female customer with the annual income of $20,000 is predicted
to be 3 years (= &minus;1 + 0.2 &times; 20 + 0.5 &times; 0). On the other hand, a male
customer with the annual income of $30,000 is predicted to maintain his
subscription for 5.5 years (= &minus;1 + 0.2 &times; 30 + 0.5 &times; 1) on average.
In addition, the regression line indicates that there is a positive relationship
between subscription duration and annual income. With the same income, a
male would stay longer than a female by 1/2 year.
</p>
<p>3 The dataset of complete observations may result in sample selection bias when the
characteristics of the complete observations are different from those of the right-censored
observations. For example, current customers may be satisfied with the ABC newspaper,
but previous customers may have switched to other newspapers. As a result, current
customers may have longer subscription durations than previous customers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15.5 Time Duration (Hazard) Models 395
</p>
<p>The application of the regression line to current customers allows us to
forecast how much longer they will remain with the ABC newspaper. Suppose
that Customer 4 in Figure 15.2 is female with the annual income of $30,000.
Her predicted duration is 5 years. Since she has subscribed for a year so far,
we expect that she will remain four more years with the ABC newspaper.
Moreover, we can use the results of the regression model to target potential
customers. Computing the predicted duration for each of potential customers,
we rank order them in terms of their subscription durations. Recognizing that
a customer with the longer duration will generate bigger profits for the ABC
newspaper, we only select customers with predicted duration greater than a
specified cutoff.
</p>
<p>However, a regression model has several limitations in analyzing duration
data (Helsen and Schmittlein 1993). First, because of potential censoring bias,
the regression model is not applied to all customers, but only those for whom
we have observed their full lifespan. It will be problematic especially when the
number of complete observations is small relative to the number of incomplete
observations. Second, a regression model is very limited in helping marketers
to manage the customer relationship. For example, marketers may want to
know the attrition probability for each customer during the specified period of
time. A bank prepares a special promotion to target customers who have high
attrition probability during the upcoming month. A regression model cannot
easily answer this question.4 For more discussion on the limitation of a regres-
sion in the analysis of duration data, see Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980) or
Lawless (2003).
</p>
<p>15.5.3 Hazard Models
</p>
<p>Recently researchers from various disciplines have devoted considerable at-
tention to the analysis of duration, survival time, lifetime, or failure time
data. Engineers would like to know how long a light bulb lasts under vari-
ous conditions. Medical researchers want to know how long an AIDS infected
patient will live. Economists are interested in knowing the duration of un-
employment. Subscription managers in newspaper want to know how long
customers will subscribe to their newspapers. Customer managers at Verizon
may have interest in knowing how long their customers will stay with Verizon
before they switch to other carriers.
</p>
<p>4 We can partially overcome this limitation by dividing the observation period into even
intervals. For each interval, a customer indicator (1 if a customer stays, and 0 if she does
not) is used as a dependent variable. Because of its discrete nature, we now apply the
binary logit or probit. However, the logit or probit has other shortcomings in modeling
duration time such as arbitrarily determined time intervals. See Helsen and Schmittlein
(1993) for more discussion.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>396 15 Discrete Dependent Variables and Duration Models
</p>
<p>Hazard models are specially designed to analyze duration data. Helsen and
Schmittlein (1993) note several advantages over traditional tools such as a
linear regression and discrete time probit or logistic regression in the analy-
sis of duration data. Similar to the example given in the previous section,
the variable of interest is the length of time that elapses from the beginning
of an event either to the end of the event (for uncensored data) or the end
of the observation period (for censored data). For the example in Fig. 15.2,
we have observations, t1, t2, . . ., t1000 with t1 = 2, t2 = 4, . . ., t1000 = 2.
Note that the starting time of the event can be different across observa-
tions. Note also that we often have information on customer character-
istics that will be related to the observed duration, ti(i = 1, . . ., 1000).
These characteristics are typically demographics such as family size, in-
come and marital status, but hazard models can also include time-varying
&ldquo;covariates&rdquo; such as purchase recency or the timing of previous marketing
contacts.
</p>
<p>Let us define T to be a random variable representing the duration time
of interest (e.g., the time the customer stays with the company) and its
(continuous) probability density function be f(t), where t is a realization
of T . Then its cumulative density function, or the probability the customer
leaves the company before period t, is
</p>
<p>F (t) =
&int; t
0
</p>
<p>f(s)ds = P (T &le; t) (15.20)
</p>
<p>The survival function is defined as the probability that the length of the
duration is at least t. That is, the survival function is S(t) = 1 &minus; F (t) =
P (T &gt; t). Researchers prefer directly to model the hazard function to the
probability density function because of its mathematical convenience. The
hazard rate is the probability that the event occurs at t, given that it has not
occurred until t. That is, the hazard rate is a kind of a conditional probability.
For an example in life insurance, the hazard rate measures the probability
that a customer cancels the policy between periods t and t +∆t, where ∆t
is a short period of time, given that she maintains the policy for t years.
Formally defined, the hazard rate is
</p>
<p>h(t) = lim
∆t&rarr;0
</p>
<p>P (t &le; T &le; t+∆t|T &ge; t)
∆t
</p>
<p>= lim
∆t&rarr;0
</p>
<p>P (t &le; T &le; t+∆t)/P (T &ge; t)
∆t
</p>
<p>= lim
∆t&rarr;0
</p>
<p>[F (t+∆t)&minus; F (t)]/S(t)
∆t
</p>
<p>=
f(t)
S(t)
</p>
<p>(15.21)
</p>
<p>Note that&minus;d lnS(t)/dt=&minus;[dS(t)/dt]/S(t)=&minus;[&minus;f(t)]/S(t)=h(t). The term,
&minus; lnS(t) = Λ(t), is called the integrated hazard function. It equals &int; t
</p>
<p>0
h(s)ds
</p>
<p>since &minus;dΛ(t)/dt = h(t). Then the survival function S(t) = exp[&minus;Λ(t)].5
</p>
<p>5 This equation is useful to calculate the survival probability (up to T &lowast;) for current
customers once we have estimated the parameters of the hazard function.</p>

<p>Hence, the density function f(t) can be written as

</p>
<p>(15.22)
</p>
<p>How do we model the hazard rate h(t)? The simplest model may be to assume
h(t) is a constant h0. This model implies that the hazard rate is constant as t
increases as shown on Fig. 15.3. With a constant hazard rate, the probability
that a customer cancels the insurance policy given she maintains the policy
for 1 month is the same as the probability that a customer cancels the policy
given she maintains the policy for 10 years. Substituting h(t) = h0 into
the Equation 15.22, we can derive f(t) that equals to h0e&minus;hot. That is, the
probability density function corresponding to a constant hazard rate is an
exponential distribution for duration time. The exponential distribution has
a memoryless property that leads to the constant hazard rate.
</p>
<p>For many applications, the constant hazard function is too restrictive. A
natural extension allowing for monotonically increasing or decreasing hazard
is to assume that h(t) = β0 + β1t where β0 and β1 are parameters to be
estimated. If β1 is zero, the model goes back to the constant hazard model.
If β1 is positive as shown in Fig. 15.3, the hazard rate is increasing with t.
The case is said to have positive duration dependence. We occasionally find
positive duration dependence in the analysis of shopping data. A shopper
tends to have a low probability of repurchasing the product immediately
after she buys it. The probability will increase as t increases because house-
hold inventory is depleting. On the other hand, if β1 is negative, the hazard
rate is monotonically decreasing with t. This negative duration dependence
frequently occurs in the analysis of direct marketing data.</p>

<p>The shapes of these hazards are shown in Fig. 15.3. The exponential has a con-
stant hazard while the Weibull can be monotonically increasing or decreasing
function depending on the value of p. On the other hand, the log-logistic as-
sumes that the hazard rate is monotonically increasing at the beginning and
then decreasing later (Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980).
</p>
<p>The parameters of the hazard model can be estimated by maximum like-
lihood. Given the duration data of n samples, t1, t2, . . ., tn, the log-likelihood
function can be written as
</p>
<p>lnL =

</p>
<p>lnS(t|θ) (15.23)
</p>
<p>Note that the only information available for the right-censored observations is
the survivor rate. The above log-likelihood function is highly nonlinear so that
an iterative search algorithm such as the BHHH method is used to find the
optimal solution (Berndt et al. 1974). Hazard models can be estimated in SAS
using either of two procedures. PROC PHREG may be more popular since
it can handle time-varying covariates (e.g., marketing) and various forms of
hazard functions. However, if the shapes of survival distribution and hazard
function are known, PROC LIFEREG produces more efficient estimates with
faster speed.
</p>
<p>15.5.4 Incorporating Covariates into the
Hazard Function
</p>
<p>There are several approaches to incorporating independent variables in a haz-
ard model. First, we can model the parameter of the parametric hazard rate
h(t) to be a function of independent variables. For example, the parameter λ
of the exponential and the Weibull hazard is modeled as
</p>
<p>λi = exp(&minus;ββ&prime;Xi) (15.24)</p>

<p>where Xi is the vector of independent variables for observation i and ββ is
the corresponding parameter vector. Cox (1972) has proposed a more flexible
method called the proportional hazard model. He defines the hazard rate of
observation i, hi(t |X) as
</p>
<p>hi(t |X) = h0(t)ψi(X) = h0(t) exp(&minus;ββ&prime;Xi) (15.25)
</p>
<p>where h0(t) is the baseline hazard rate and ψi(X) incorporates covariates
(or independent variables) that may be time-varying. The baseline hazard is
the hazard rate that describes the relationship between the hazard rate and
time duration, and can specified as constant, exponential, Weibul, etc., as
discussed above (see also Seetharaman and Chintagunta 2003).
</p>
<p>Going back to the example of ABC newspaper, we employ a proportional
hazard model to the duration data with two independent variables, income
and sex. Allowing for monotonically increasing or decreasing hazards, we
estimated the hazard function incorporating independent variables as
</p>
<p>hi(t |X) = h0(t)ψi(X) = h0(t) exp(&minus;β2 &times; Income&minus; β3 &times; sex) (15.26)
</p>
<p>Upon estimation, we can evaluate from the β coefficients how each indepen-
dent variable influences the hazard rate: 100 &times; [exp(ββ) &minus; 1] measures the
percentage change of the hazard rate with respect to the unit change of the
independent variable (Tuma and Hannan 1984).
</p>
<p>We conclude this section with a real application of the hazard model pro-
vided by Poel and Larivière (2004). They applied the proportional hazard
model to data from a European financial services company that offers bank-
ing and insurance services towards customers. The data set consists of a ran-
dom sample of 47,157 customers, of whom 47% churned (uncensored sample)
and the rest are current customers (censored sample). They considered var-
ious categories of independent variable to explain retention (or churn), but
we report some of their estimates for an expositional purpose in Table 15.2.
</p>
<p>Table 15.2 shows that customers whose interpurchase time increases expe-
rience shorter duration time. Every additional year in the average interpur-
chase time is associated with a 100 &times; [exp(0.048) &minus; 1] = 4.9% higher proba-
bility to churn. The more products owned by a customer the more likely she</p>

</p>
<p>is to stay with the company. An increase of one additional product lowers
the switching probability with 99.9% (e.g., 100&times; [exp(&minus;6.856)&minus;1] = &minus;99.9).
Older people are less inclined to leave the company. As a customer&rsquo;s age in-
creases by one, her probability to leave decreases by 2.2%. Men (coded as 1)
are 141% more likely to leave the company than females. More educated peo-
ple have a somewhat (8.2%) lower attrition probability. Finally, customers
with a high social status have a significantly lower attrition probability than
customers who live in an area that is associated with a low social status.</p>

<p>Cluster Analysis
</p>
<p>Abstract Cluster analysis segments a customer database so that customers
within segments are similar, and collectively different from customers in other
segments. Similarity is in terms of the &ldquo;clustering variables,&rdquo; which may
be psychographics, demographics, or transaction measures such as RFM.
The clusters often have rich interpretations with strong implications for which
customers should be targeted with a particular offer or marketed to in a cer-
tain way. This chapter discusses the details of cluster analysis, including
measures of similarity, the major cluster methods, and how to decide upon
the number of clusters and their interpretation.
</p>
<p>16.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Marketers have used cluster analysis to segment the market for a long time.
It allows marketers to group their customers into several homogeneous clus-
ters such that customers in the same cluster are similar in terms of their
demographic and behavioral characteristics while customers across different
clusters are different.
</p>
<p>Cluster analysis is often confused with classification tasks. Both techniques
segment subjects into several groups. But they are different in their goals. In
classification we know the number of groups and the segment membership
of each subject. The goal is to predict the segment membership of a new
subject once a classification model is estimated. On the other hand, we do not
have any predefined segments in clustering. Its objective is simply to group
subjects into several homogeneous clusters. Using the terminology of machine
learning, classification is a typical task of directed knowledge discovery while
clustering is an example of undirected knowledge discovery.
</p>
<p>In a classification task we have a dependent variable. For example, a bank
wants to evaluate the credit risks of card applicants in order to decide whom
to issue their credit cards. In order to develop the forecasting model, we first
analyze the existing customer data for which each customer is already known
to be either a defaulter or not. An appropriate model such as a discriminant
</p>
<p>401</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>402 16 Cluster Analysis
</p>
<p>analysis or logistic regression is applied to the data, taking customer&rsquo;s credit
status (i.e., defaulter or not) as the dependent variable and his/her demo-
graphic and behavioral characteristics as the independent variables. Upon
estimating model parameters, we can classify new card applicants into either
defaulters or non-defaulters by obtaining information on their demographic
and behavioral characteristics.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are no pre-classified groups in clustering. We do
not make any distinction between dependent and independent variables. Our
goal is to group subjects into an arbitrary number of homogeneous segments
in terms of their characteristics or variables. Because of the subjectivity
involved in determining the number of clusters and selecting the clustering
algorithm with a similarity measure, clustering is often considered as an
exploratory data analytic technique.
</p>
<p>Because of its exploratory nature, there is always the question of whether
the cluster analysis has produced the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; segmentation scheme. A prac-
tical answer is that there are multiple ways to segment the market. The
question is whether a given segmentation scheme is managerially useful. Cer-
tainly the interpretability of the segmentation scheme makes it more useful.
But in a database marketing context, a crucial consideration is whether a
given segmentation scheme can be used for targeting. We discuss this issue
in Sect. 16.3.2. It is noteworthy that most of the clustering techniques are
algorithms that try to group customers into groups so that customers within
groups are similar to each other and collectively different from clusters in
other groups. There is no underlying statistical model or theory that hypoth-
esizes a true underlying grouping that needs to be discovered. This also clouds
the issue of whether the obtained solution is &ldquo;correct.&rdquo; With most clustering
methods, sources of error and variation are not formally considered. Hence,
clustering results will be sensitive to outliers or noise points. The exception
to this is probabilistic clustering, which is described in Sect. 16.2.3.3.
</p>
<p>16.2 The Clustering Process
</p>
<p>Conducting a cluster analysis consists of several steps:
</p>
<p>&bull; Select variables on which to cluster
&bull; Select a similarity measure and scale the variables
&bull; Select a clustering method
&bull; Determine the number of clusters
&bull; Conduct the cluster analysis, interpret the results, and apply them
</p>
<p>There are several methods that can be used for each of these steps, espe-
cially involving similarity measures and clustering methods. Choice of these
methods is often subjective. For example, an analyst who has found a certain
similarity measure, scaling procedure, and clustering method to be successful</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16.2 The Clustering Process 403
</p>
<p>in the past will tend to use that approach again. It is often a good idea to
try a few different approaches in one application, to see which yields the best
results. The reader should recognize, however, that there are many method-
ological choices to be made with a cluster analysis, and no set of choices that
all database marketers agree on as optimal. As mentioned above, often the
choice of method hinges on the question &ndash; are the results useful?
</p>
<p>16.2.1 Selecting Clustering Variables
</p>
<p>The first question the analyst faces is what variables should form the basis
for the clustering. That is, on which set of variables do we want to form
homogeneous groups of customers? In typical applications, there are several
variables available. These include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Benefits sought: These are measures of what benefits in a product or ser-
vice customers deem to be important. They can be collected by asking
customers directly in a survey (e.g., &ldquo;How important is price to you?&rdquo;), or
via a conjoint analysis or other indirect measure of benefits sought.
</p>
<p>&bull; Psychographics: Attitudes and behaviors relevant to a particular product
category. For example, if the product category is consumer electronics,
customer self-report of whether they see themselves as innovators, opinion
leaders, or &ldquo;gadget freaks,&rdquo; are psychographics. Ownership and usage of
various electronics products are also psychographics.
</p>
<p>&bull; Demographics: These include age, income, region, employment, etc.
&bull; Geo-demographics: These include variables inferred by where the customer
</p>
<p>lives. For example, the US census makes publicly available average income,
age, home ownership, etc., for fairly small geographic units such as &ldquo;census
blocks.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; Behavior: These include recency, frequency, and monetary value behaviors
measured from the company&rsquo;s customer file. These can be measured by
department (e.g., frequency of purchasing men&rsquo;s clothes, women&rsquo;s clothes,
children&rsquo;s clothes, accessories). Behavior can also include sales channels
through which the customer buys.
</p>
<p>&bull; Competitive measures: These include share of wallet, competitor prefer-
ences, etc.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer value: These might include responsiveness to marketing, lifetime
value, customer lifetime duration, customer risk, etc.
</p>
<p>The choice of variables on which to cluster might depend on the application.
For example, for a new product application, clustering on benefits sought
might be most useful. For a cross-selling application, clustering on channel
usage or RFM for various departments might be useful. For a customer tier
program, clustering on customer value might be useful.
</p>
<p>One strategy is to use one of the above sets of variables for the cluster-
ing variables, and then the other variables for the &ldquo;discrimination variables.&rdquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>404 16 Cluster Analysis
</p>
<p>These variables can aid in interpretation and in classifying new customers to
clusters. The reason not to mix types of variables as clustering variables is
the interpretation may become difficult, and also, different types of variables
are most likely measured on different scales, which brings up a scaling prob-
lem (discussed in Sect. 16.2.2.3). In Sect. 16.3, we will show a hypothetical
example to illustrate the roles of clustering and discrimination variables.
</p>
<p>A practical question is, given we know the type of variables on which we
want to cluster, how many variables should we use? This issue, the problem
called &ldquo;variable selection,&rdquo; has been well studied in classical regression. Omit-
ting relevant variables results in biased parameter estimates while including
irrelevant variables leads to overfitting the model (Greene 1997). However, the
selection of clustering variables has rarely been studied. Technically speaking,
one can cluster on any number of variables. However, often it is advantageous
to keep the number of variables relatively small (say 5&ndash;15) to aid in interpre-
tation.1
</p>
<p>16.2.2 Similarity Measures
</p>
<p>The goal of clustering is to group customers into several homogeneous clus-
ters. Customers in the same cluster are supposed to be similar while subjects
across different clusters are dissimilar. We need to be more precise. How do
you define the similarity between customers?
</p>
<p>Clustering begins with selecting a similarity measure and a set of variables
regarding which the similarity is calculated. Care should be taken in selecting
a similarity measure since different measures often lead to different clustering
results. It is recommended to apply several different similarity measures and
check the stability of clustering results. Unstable clustering results may imply
that the clusters found do not provide a meaningful or usable segmentation
scheme.
</p>
<p>16.2.2.1 Distance-Type Similarity Measures
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of similarity measures: distance type
and matching type. Distance types of similarity measures are more appropri-
ate when variables are measured on a common metric, so that the similarity
between two customers can be measured as their distance in a metric space.
For example, three customers are plotted in Fig. 16.1. Each customer is repre-
sented as a point in two-dimensional space. Expressed in matrix terminology,
</p>
<p>1 It is also recommended to study correlation structure among candidate clustering vari-
ables. Including highly correlated variables in a cluster analysis has the effect of weight-
ing up an underlying dimension. Hence, if two variables are highly correlated, either one
of them should be deleted.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16.2 The Clustering Process 405
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.1 Defining similarity&lowast;.
&lowast;Points A, B, and C represent customers, in particular their values for Attributes 1
and 2.
</p>
<p>we have the 3 &times; 2 data matrix where there are three customers and two at-
tributes describing each customer. The distance between Customers A and B
is the shortest among all three pairwise inter-point distances. Hence, we may
say that Customer A is similar to Customer B in terms of their attributes
(e.g., income and age). We are implicitly using the distance between points
or subjects as the similarity measure.
</p>
<p>The most popular distance similarity measure is the Euclidean distance
between points (Hair et al. 1992). The Euclidean distance between two p-
dimensional subjects x = [x1, . . . , xp]&prime; and y = [y1, . . . , yp]&prime; is defined as
</p>
<p>d(x,y) = [(x1 &minus; y1)2 + . . .+ (xp &minus; yp)2]1/2 = [(x&minus; y)&prime;(x&minus; y)]1/2 (16.1)
</p>
<p>Each subject is represented in two-dimensional space (p = 2) in Fig. 16.1.
Hence, the Euclidean distance between Customers A and B is
</p>
<p>&radic;
5 = [(1 &minus;
</p>
<p>2)2+(1&minus;3)2]1/2. Similarly, the distance between Customers A and C is 2&radic;5
and the distance between B and C is 3. The distance between Customers A
and B is the shortest. So A and B are said to be the most similar.
</p>
<p>The Minkowski metric generalizes the concept of the Euclidean distance.
The Minkowski distance between two p-dimensional subjects is given by
</p>
<p>d(x,y) =
[&sum;p
</p>
<p>i=1
|xi &minus; yi|m
</p>
<p>]1/m
(16.2)
</p>
<p>where it becomes the Euclidean distance whenm is equal to two. On the other
hand, the Minkowski metric with m = 1 is called the city-block distance. For
example, the city-block distance between Customers A and B in Fig. 16.1 is
the sum of the horizontal and the vertical distance, which in this case would
be 3 (= 1 + 2).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>406 16 Cluster Analysis
</p>
<p>16.2.2.2 Matching-Type Similarity Measures
</p>
<p>Geometric distance is not meaningful for categorical variables. Instead, we
can use the degree of matching to measure the similarity between customers
when they are represented by a set of categorical characteristics. For example,
two customers are treated as similar if both of them are students.
</p>
<p>More formally, we measure the similarity between two customers as the de-
gree of matching, specifically, the ratio of the number of matching attributes
to the total number of attributes considered. For a simple example, suppose
that two customers are represented by the presence (coded as 1) or absence
(coded as 0) of five attributes. If Customer A&rsquo;s attributes can be represented
as x = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]&prime; and Customer B&rsquo;s as y = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]&prime;, then there are
three matches out of five attribute comparisons and, so the similarity be-
tween Customers A and B is 0.6.
</p>
<p>There are some variants of matching-type similarity measures such as as-
signing differential weighting on matching from mismatching cases. For ex-
ample, when there are an unusually large number of zeros in the data, we
assign a large weight on the matches of ones. Similarly, when there are a lot
of ones, a large weight is assigned on the matches of zeros. More sophisticated
similarity measures are discussed in Chapter 14.
</p>
<p>One question is what to do if some of the clustering variables are metric, in
which case a distance type similarity measure would be appropriate, and some
are categorical, in which case a matching metric may be appropriate. There is
no clear answer here. One practical solution is to code the categorical variables
as 0&ndash;1 and use them together with the metric variables and a distance-type
similarity measure. This will &ldquo;work&rdquo; in that the distance measure can be
calculated, but we would be mixing variables measured in different units
and this raises a scaling problem (discussed in the next section). Another
possibility is to use only one type of clustering variable (e.g., benefits sought),
that are all scaled the same way (in this case, with a common metric), so the
problem of mixing metric and categorical variables doesn&rsquo;t arise.
</p>
<p>16.2.2.3 Scaling and Weighting
</p>
<p>Even metric variables are frequently measured in different units, and this can
distort the cluster analysis results. For an example, if we multiply one variable
by a large number, say 100, then the similarity measure will be dominated
by the value of the variable. Hence, it is advisable to rescale the variables
such that a percentage change of one variable is not more significant than
the same percentage change of another variable in similarity calculation.
</p>
<p>The scaling problem essentially comes from the different variances mea-
sured in each variable. In order to avoid the scaling problem due to dif-
ferent units of measurement, one approach is to make the variances of
all variables to be the same. There are two remedies commonly used in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16.2 The Clustering Process 407
</p>
<p>practice. The first approach is to rescale all the variables to range from
zero to one. If Xi is the original variable and X&lowast;i is the scaled variable,
X&lowast;i = (Xi &minus;Xmin)/(Xmax &minus;Xmin) where Xmin is the minimum and Xmax is
the maximum observed value for the original variable. Alternatively, we can
standardize all the variables so that the rescaled variables have the common
means of zero and the common variances of one. If Xi is the original variable,
the rescaled variable Zi = (Xi &minus; X̄)/σX where X̄ is the mean of the original
variable and σX is the corresponding standard deviation.2
</p>
<p>While the above at first seems to solve the scaling problem, it may limit the
results in important ways. For example, assume we have measured benefits
sought on a 5-point scale. Further, assume that Price Importance has a mean
of 3.0 and a standard deviation of 1.0. That suggests that customers vary
considerably in the importance they attach to price. Now assume that Quality
Importance also has a mean of 3.0 but a standard deviation of 0.5. This means
that customers do not vary so much in the importance they attach to quality.
If we standardize these variables, they will both have a variance of one, but
we are losing important information, that in fact customers vary a lot on
the importance of price, and not so much on the importance of quality. This
example assumes the same units of measurement, but the same problem can
arise when standardizing variables measured in different units. Let&rsquo;s say that
we also include a measure of Service Importance based on the number of calls
the customer has made to the call center. Let&rsquo;s say the mean of this variable
is 10 with a standard deviation of 10. This means there is wide variation
in this variable, and the variable is skewed to the right (since the number
of calls cannot be less than zero). Standardizing this variable puts it on an
equal footing with Quality Importance because both variables have the same
variance. This obscures the fact that customers really all feel roughly the
same about quality, but vary a lot in the importance they attach to service.
This &ldquo;true&rdquo; variation on service importance could be an important factor
in defining segments that we will miss out by equalizing the variance of all
variables.
</p>
<p>There are no easy answers to the re-scaling issue. One possibility is only
to use as clustering variables that are scaled the same way, and not stan-
dardize (e.g., use measures of benefits sought measured on a 5-point scale).
However, this is not always possible. For example, demographics are natu-
rally measured on different scales (e.g., age and income). It is for this reason
that cluster analysis truly is an exploratory technique. One can try various
rescaling procedures, as well as distance measures, examine how it changes
the nature and interpretation of the clusters, then make a decision of which
clustering solution to use.
</p>
<p>2 Variables in database marketing (e.g., monetary value) are often highly skewed. And
right skewed variables tend to produce many tiny clusters and a couple of big ones,
which is not desirable. With skewed variables, it is recommended to take logs and then
standardize the variables.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>408 16 Cluster Analysis
</p>
<p>Another way to deal with the scaling issue, as well as take into account
the managerial importance of different clustering variables, is to consider
weighting each of the clustering variables. For example, if we believe that
the income variable is much more important than the age of household head
in deciding the similarities among households, it is reasonable to assign a
large weight on the income variable by multiplying it by a large number
(at least larger than one). However, in contrast to the objectivity of the
scaling solution, finding the appropriate weights is a rather subjective task.
We suggest that the weighting be considered only when you have a priori
reasons based on previous studies or your own experience. In addition, if
weighting is to be used, we suggest that a number of different weights (e.g.,
various multiples on the income variable) be tried and the corresponding
clustering outcomes be compared in terms of interpretation and managerial
relevance.
</p>
<p>16.2.3 Clustering Methods
</p>
<p>The goal of clustering is to group subjects into an arbitrary number of seg-
ments such that customers in the same segment are similar in their charac-
teristics while customers across different segments are dissimilar. However,
it is not a simple task to find the optimal clustering solution. For example,
there exist millions of ways to cluster only 20 customers. There is one way
to form one cluster with 20 customers. There are 524,287 ways to group 20
customers into two clusters! There are much more ways for three clusters,
and so on.3 A theoretical method of finding the optimal clustering solution
may be to enumerate all possible clustering solutions and select the best one.
However, it is practically impossible to list all possible solutions. Hence, re-
searchers have developed heuristic methodologies that may not necessarily
find the optimal solution (if indeed there is a single conclusion what could
call optimal) but acceptable ones.
</p>
<p>There are a number of algorithms available for clustering. As shown in
Fig. 16.2, they are broadly classified into two groups: hierarchical and non-
hierarchical clustering technique.
</p>
<p>Hierarchical clustering develops a tree-like structure either by serially
merging clusters (agglomerative method) or by successively dividing clus-
ters (the divisive method). Given n customers, agglomerative hierarchical
starts with the n cluster solution, where each customer is his or her own
cluster. It then produces an (n &minus; 1) cluster solution by combining the two
most similar customers, an (n &minus; 2) cluster solution, and so on. This merg-
ing is continued until all customers are classified into a single cluster. Divi-
sive hierarchical clustering proceeds in the opposite direction. It starts with

<p>the one-cluster solution consisting of all n customers, and then divides n
customers into two clusters such that customers in one cluster are dissim-
ilar to the customers in the other cluster. This division is continued until
each customer becomes one cluster. We will cover agglomerative clustering
in more detail in the next subsection. However, divisive method is not cov-
ered here since the algorithm is very similar to the decision trees described in
Chapter 17.
</p>
<p>More recently developed, nonhierarchical clustering techniques find the
cluster solution given the number of clusters pre-specified by the user. Even
though there are several methods that can be classified as nonhierarchical
clustering, we will cover K-means clustering, probabilistic clustering and
self-organizing map. K-means clustering starts with randomly assigning n
customers into K clusters and successively improves the partitions by chang-
ing the cluster membership of each customer. Probabilistic clustering can be
considered as a probabilistic version of K-means technique that overcomes
its several limitations, at the cost of making various assumptions. Finally,
self-organizing maps (SOM) is a special type of neural network model that
can be useful in detecting clusters. It has several features that are similar to
a typical neural network model and some other features that are similar to
K-means clustering.
</p>
<p>16.2.3.1 Agglomerative Clustering
</p>
<p>Marketers have used agglomerative clustering algorithm for a long time in
segmenting their customers. We describe the common algorithmic structure
of agglomerative clustering even though there are a number of variants such</p>

<p>as linkage methods, variance methods and so on (Johnson and Wichern
1982). Agglomerative clustering starts with n clusters given n customers,
that is, it considers each customer its own cluster, and then successively
merges customers in terms of their similarities until all subjects are clas-
sified into a single cluster. The algorithm can best be understood by an
example.
</p>
<p>Suppose we have five customers and calculate pairwise similarities using
one of the similarity definitions discussed in the previous section. The re-
sulting similarity matrix is given in Table 16.1(a). Only the lower triangular
of the matrix is shown because of its symmetric property (the similarity of
Customer A to Customer B is the same thing as the similarity of Customer
B to A). Table 16.1(a) shows that Customers 1 and 2 are the most similar
(or the nearest) among all pairs. Hence, we merge these two customers into
a cluster named (12). Now we have four clusters that consist of the cluster
(12), the cluster (3), the cluster (4), and the cluster (5).
</p>
<p>We update the similarity or distance matrix since a new cluster, cluster
(12), has been created. The distances among the cluster (3), the cluster (4)
and the cluster (5) stay the same. However, the distances between the new
cluster (12) and the rest of the clusters should be recalculated. There are
three different ways to define the distance between clusters: a simple linkage,
the complete linkage and the average linkage. The simple linkage defines the
distance as the shortest one among cluster members. For example, the cluster
(12) has two customers. The distance between Customer 1 and the cluster
(3) is 5 and the distance between Customer 2 and the cluster (3) is 6. Hence,
the simple linkage distance between the cluster (12) and the cluster (3) is
5. The distances between the cluster (12) and the rest of the clusters can
be similarly calculated. Table 16.1(b) shows the distance matrix of 4-cluster
solution using a simple linkage method. On the other hand, a complete linkage
selects the farthest distance. Hence, the distance between the cluster (12) and
the cluster (3) is 6 by the complete linkage. Finally, an average linkage takes
the average distance. If we use the average linkage, the distance between the
cluster (12) and the cluster (3) is 5.5.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 16.3 Dendrogram for agglomerative clustering example.
</p>
<p>From now on we limit our discussion to a simple linkage method.
Table 16.1(b) suggests that the cluster (3) and the cluster (4) should be
merged next since the distance between these two is the shortest among
four clusters. Merging these two, we form the cluster (34), and now have
three clusters: cluster (12), cluster (34) and cluster (5). Table 16.1(c) shows
the updated distance matrix for the 3-cluster solution that indicates the next
merging is between cluster (12) and cluster (34). The 2-cluster solution con-
sists of cluster (1234) and cluster (5) and its updated distance matrix is
shown in Table 16.1(d). Finally, merging these two clusters results in a single
cluster including all five customers.
</p>
<p>We often summarize the iterations from n-cluster solution to a single clus-
ter by a tree-like diagram called dendrogram. The Greek word &ldquo;dendron&rdquo;
means a tree. Figure 16.3 shows the dendrogram for the example with five
customers. The x-axis in the dendrogram represents the identification of each
customer while the y-axis shows the overall picture of cluster formation and
distance information when merging. The dendrogram is often used as a tool
for choosing the number of clusters relevant to the user. The distances at
which clusters are combined can be calculated from the dendrogram. We
choose the number of clusters at which the distance increase is suddenly
large. However, as the number of customers becomes larger, the dendrogram
becomes quite messy. Moreover, it is rather subjective to determine the num-
ber of clusters using the dendrogram. We discuss more formal procedures in
determining the number of clusters in Sect. 16.2.4.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>412 16 Cluster Analysis
</p>
<p>Agglomerative clustering is simple to apply and easy to understand. How-
ever, it has a critical limitation because of its tree-like structure. Also, once
customers are incorrectly clustered in the earlier stage of the clustering
process, the solution will be seriously biased, the error propagates through
the rest of the tree, and re-clustering is not allowed.
</p>
<p>16.2.3.2 K-Means Clustering
</p>
<p>The K-means may be the most popular clustering method among data min-
ers. Given the number of clusters k specified by the user, the algorithm starts
with randomly choosing k points among n customers that become the initial
cluster centers. Each of the remaining customers is assigned to the one of k
cluster centers according to the Euclidean distance. Once all customers are
grouped into k clusters, new cluster &ldquo;centers&rdquo; are calculated, typically as the
mean values for each of the clustering variables for each cluster, and each
subject is reassigned according to the distances to these new cluster centers.
We stop iterations when no more reassignments occur.
</p>
<p>We study the K-means algorithm in more detail by a simple example.
Suppose we have four customers whose characteristics are represented in two
attributes, say income and age. Table 16.2(a) shows the attribute values for
each of these four customers. If we want to create two clusters (or k = 2), we
randomly select two customers and their attribute values become the initial
cluster centers. Suppose that Customers B and C be selected. Customer A is
clustered into Customer C because its distance to Customer B is 10 and its
distance to Customer C is
</p>
<p>&radic;
68 = 8.2. Similarly, Customer D is merged into
</p>
<p>Customer B because its distance to Customer B is shorter than to Customer
C. As a result, we have two clusters, the cluster (AC) and the cluster (BD),
after the first iteration.
</p>
<p>Once all subjects are assigned into two clusters, we calculate the &ldquo;cen-
ters&rdquo;, or &ldquo;centroids&rdquo;, of these two clusters shown in Fig. 16.2(b). Note that
the centroid for a given cluster is simply the vector of mean characteristics
across the cluster members. Now we check the possibility of reassignment by
evaluating the distances between each subject and the new cluster centroids.
Customer A should not be moved because his or her distance to the centroid
of the cluster (AC) is
</p>
<p>&radic;
17 = 4.1 while his or her distance to the centroid of
</p>
<p>the cluster (BD) is
&radic;
122 = 11.0. However, Customer C should be reassigned
</p>
<p>to cluster (BD) because his or her distance to the centroid of the cluster (BD)
is
</p>
<p>&radic;
10 = 3.2 that is shorter than the customer&rsquo;s distance to the centroid of
</p>
<p>the cluster (AC),
&radic;
17 = 4.1. Using the same method, Customers B and D are
</p>
<p>should stay in their current cluster. In result, we now have two new clusters,
the cluster (A) and the cluster (BCD), after the second iteration.
</p>
<p>Figure 16.2(c) shows the centroids of the new clusters. Given the new two
clusters and their centroids, we again evaluate whether each customer should
be moved or not. None of the customers should move. Hence, we stop the</p>

<p>algorithm at this iteration, and conclude that our final two-cluster solution
is the cluster (A) and the cluster (BCD).
</p>
<p>The K-means method is more appropriate than agglomerative clustering
for large data application because it is computationally faster. The K-means
is linear in the number of observations, while agglomerative is often cubic,
depending on the dissimilarity measure. Moreover, it does not require a large
amount of storage space in computer memory since its algorithm does not
need to save the distance matrices. However, the final solution of theK-means
clustering depends on its initial condition. In our example, we randomly se-
lected k initial points or centroids.4 Different initial centroids might result
in a different final solution. Therefore, it is recommended to generate sev-
eral starting points and compare the corresponding final solutions. Finally,
K-means clustering algorithm implicitly assumes spherically shaped clusters
with a common error variance. Hence, it tends to produce equal-sized clusters
(Everitt 1993).
</p>
<p>16.2.3.3 Probabilistic Clustering
</p>
<p>Both agglomerative and K-means clustering have a critical limitation in as-
signing subjects into clusters. The models assume that each subject belongs
to only one cluster. They do not allow any statements on the strength of
a subject&rsquo;s cluster membership. Because of their deterministic nature, these
methods are sensitive to outliers and do not perform well with overlapping
clusters, i.e., when a customer is partially in one cluster and partially in
</p>
<p>4 Alternatively, we can randomly partition all subjects into k initial clusters. However,
this method is not exempted from the same problem.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>414 16 Cluster Analysis
</p>
<p>another. Attracting renewed attention from researchers, probabilistic cluster-
ing overcomes this problem by incorporating uncertainty about a customer&rsquo;s
cluster membership. Another attractive aspect of probabilistic clustering is
that it assumes there is a true underlying set of clusters, and the task is to
uncover them. This is conceptually more pleasing than other methods that
are really just common-sense algorithms for grouping customers together but
can&rsquo;t guarantee the solution is unique or correct in any real sense.
</p>
<p>Probabilistic clustering has other advantages as well. It does not require
the scaling of variables. For example, when working with normal distributions
with unknown variances, the results will be the same irrespective of whether
the observed variables are normalized or not (Magidson and Vermunt 2002).
In addition, it includes a more statistically justifiable way of determining the
number of clusters and testing the validity of the clustering results. Prob-
abilistic clustering is also called soft clustering, mixture-model clustering,
model-based clustering, or latent class cluster analysis.
</p>
<p>Probabilistic clustering assumes that the data to be clustered are generated
from a finite mixture of underlying probability distributions in which each
component distribution represents a cluster (Fraley and Raftery 1998). Let xi
be the vector of characteristics for Customer i. If Customer i is a member of
cluster s, its conditional probability distribution or &ldquo;density&rdquo; is represented
by fs(xi|θs) where θs are the parameters that describe the conditional density.
Then the unconditional probability distribution or density for the Customer
i(i = 1, . . ., n) can be written as
</p>
<p>g(xi|θ) =
S&sum;
</p>
<p>s=1
</p>
<p>πsfs(xi|θs) (16.3)
</p>
<p>where S is the number of clusters and πs is the prior probability that the
Customer i belongs to cluster s. Or πs can be considered to be the size of
the cluster s. Note that πs &ge; 0 for all s and
</p>
<p>&sum;S
s=1 πs = 1.
</p>
<p>Most of studies on the specification of the Equation 16.3 assume that
fs(xi|θs) is multivariate normal (Banfield and Raftery 1993; Cheeseman and
Stutz 1995; Dasgupta and Raftery 1998).5 Hence, the parameters θs consist
of a mean vector &micro;s and a covariance matrix Σs. The most general model
requires the estimation of means, variances, and covariances for all clusters.
However, as the number of characteristics and/or clusters increase, the num-
ber of parameters to be estimated increases significantly. Hence, a number of
researchers have proposed simpler models by restricting the potential values
for the parameters in Σs.
</p>
<p>An interesting restrictive model is the &ldquo;local independence&rdquo; model in which
all within-cluster covariances are assumed to be zero, or Σs is assumed to be
diagonal matrix. This model is not very restrictive as it sounds. The char-
acteristics are (locally) independent within the given cluster. The observed
</p>
<p>5 On the other hand, latent class models assume that fs(xi|θs) is Bernoulli or class-
conditional distributions (Bartholomew 1987).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16.2 The Clustering Process 415
</p>
<p>characteristics can still be correlated globally. Another interesting constraint
is to assume that Σs is the same across all clusters (Banfield and Raftery
1993; Vermunt and Migidson 2000).
</p>
<p>The estimation of the probability clustering is typically based on the EM
algorithm (Dempster et al. 1977; Tanner 1993). The EM algorithm is a gen-
eral approach to maximum likelihood in the presence of incomplete data.
In probability clustering, the complete data for Customer i are considered
to be yi = (xi, zi). The vector zi = (zi1, . . . , ziS) represents the missing
data, where zis equals 1 if Customer i belongs to cluster s and 0 otherwise.
Hence, the probability density of Customer i&rsquo;s data, xi, given zi becomes&prod;S
</p>
<p>s=1 fs(xi|θs)zis . Each zi is assumed to be independent and identically dis-
tributed as a multinomial distribution of one draw on S categories with prob-
abilities π1, . . . , πS . The resulting complete-data log-likelihood is
</p>
<p>�(θs, πs, zis|xi) =
n&sum;
</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>S&sum;
s=1
</p>
<p>zis[log πsfs(xi|θs)] (16.4)
</p>
<p>The complete-data log-likelihood represented by Equation 16.4 is maximized
using an iterative EM algorithm. It iterates between an E-step in which values
of ẑis = E(zis|xi, θ1, . . . , θS) are computed from the data with the current
parameter values, and an M-step in which the complete-data log-likelihood,
with each zis replaced by its current conditional expectation ẑis, is maximized
with respect to the parameters. The algorithm starts with initial guesses for
ẑis. The E-step and the M-step are iterated until a convergence criterion of
the researcher&rsquo;s choice is met.
</p>
<p>As mentioned, probability clustering has several advantages over agglom-
erative orK-means clustering. However, it is not widely used among database
marketers because of its computational difficulties. The optimization meth-
ods for probability clustering have storage and time requirements that grow
at a faster than linear rate relative to the size of the initial partition (Fraley
and Raftery 1998). Hence, it is not suitable for clustering a large number of
customers.
</p>
<p>The most popular commercial software implementing the probability clus-
tering is included in the S-PLUS package as the function mclust. Several
researchers have also improved the function mclust and written codes to
interface with S-PLUS (e.g., see www.stat.washington.edu/fraley/mclust/
soft.shtml). Alternative software to implement probability clustering is Latent
GOLD by Statistical Innovations. It implements the probability clustering
models assuming a mixture of normals, multinomials and others. It also es-
timates latent-class regression models.
</p>
<p>16.2.3.4 Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
</p>
<p>There is a type of neural network model called the self-organizing map (SOM)
that can be employed for a clustering task. Proposed by Tuevo Kohonen in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>416 16 Cluster Analysis
</p>
<p>Fig. 16.4 Architecture of a self-organizing map.
</p>
<p>1982 (Kohonen 1982), the SOM was originally used for image and sound,
and recently applied to clustering people. Like other neural network models,
the SOM has an input layer and an output layer (see Chapter 18). Each unit
(or cluster) in the output layer is connected to units (or attributes) in the
input layer and the strength of this connection is measured by a weight. How-
ever, the SOM is fundamentally different from other neural network models
in that its goal is to identify no pre-specified &ldquo;dependent variable&rdquo; for the
output layer. The SOM is looking for unknown patterns in the data. Using
the terminology of machine learning, the SOM is developed for unsupervised
learning. Hence, there are no training or pre-classified examples like other
clustering algorithms.
</p>
<p>Figure 16.4 shows the architecture of the SOM. Its input layer has five
units, implying that each customer is represented by five attributes. Rep-
resented in a 3 &times; 3 two-dimensional grid, its output layer has nine units
or clusters.6 The output layers in the SOM are generally arranged in two-
dimensional grid or lattice such as in Fig. 16.4. Each output unit is expected
to become a prototype for a cluster of customers with one homogeneous class
of input data vectors. The units in the output layers are not directly con-
nected to each other. However, this grid-like structure allows output units to
be related each other. Two adjacent units in the grid represent two similar
clusters. If more nodes are in between two units (or clusters), they are meant
to be more dissimilar.
</p>
<p>Each unit in the output layer is connected to all units in the input layer
even though we did not draw every line in Fig. 16.4. That is, the SOM can be
</p>
<p>6 Since the output layers in the SOM are typically arranged in 2-dimentional grid, the
number of initial output units is restricted to certain numbers (e.g., 3 &times; 3 or 5 &times; 4).
However, an SOM identifies fewer clusters than it has output units. Units with no hits
or with very few hits are discarded. Hence, the final number of clusters chosen can be
any numbers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16.2 The Clustering Process 417
</p>
<p>interpreted as a topology-preserving mapping from input space onto the two-
dimensional grid of output units (Vesanto and Alhoniemi 2000). The number
of data vectors available for training the SOM corresponds to the number of
customers. In Fig. 16.4, each customer has been evaluated on five attributes.
Each connection line has an associated weight, which is portrayed by a set
of five lines, each with its own weight, connecting each output unit to each
input variable.
</p>
<p>The SOM computes the weights according to learning rules. The units in
the output layer (through weight adjustments) get trained to learn about the
patterns of the input data values. During the training each output unit (or
cluster) competes to take &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; for one particular observed input
data vector. Only the winning output unit (and its neighbors) is allowed
to learn by adjusting its weights for a given input data vector. Whether an
output unit qualifies as the winner depends on the similarity of its current
weight vector w and the data vector x. More specifically, let the weight vector
of output unit k be wk = [wk1, . . ., wkJ ] where J is the number of attributes
in the input layer. At each training iteration, a data vector xi for customer
i is randomly selected from the input data, and the similarity between the
weight vector of the output unit k and the data vector is measured by their
Euclidean distance.
</p>
<p>‖xi &minus;wk‖ =
[&sum;J
</p>
<p>j=1
(xij &minus; wkj)2
</p>
<p>]1/2
(16.5)
</p>
<p>The distances between the data vector xi and each of the units in the output
layer are computed. The output unit with the smallest distance becomes the
best-matching or winning unit for the given data vector xi.
</p>
<p>Before the data vector is drawn, the weight vectors are initialized. At
each iteration, a training data vector (Xi) is randomly drawn from the input
data, and the best-matching unit is determined by calculating the distances
between the data vector and the weights for each of the units in the output
layer (the Wi&rsquo;s). The weight vectors of the winning unit along with its neigh-
boring units are updated to move closer to the data vector. As a result, each
input data vector gradually belongs to one output unit as the weight updat-
ing repeats. More specifically, the weight vector of output unit i is updated
according to the following rule.
</p>
<p>wkj(t+ 1) =
</p>
<p>{
wkj(t) + λ[xij &minus; wkj(t)] if k &isin; N(k&prime;)
wkj(t) otherwise
</p>
<p>(16.6)
</p>
<p>where t is the iteration number, λ is the learning constant with 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1,
and N(k&prime;) is the set of output units consisted of the winning unit k&prime; and its
neighbors (Kohonen 1994). Equation 16.6 implies that only the weights of the
winning unit and its neighbors are adjusted. As a result, similar output units
will be located closer to each other and similar data vectors occupy positions
closer to each other than less similar ones. Even though there are many</p>

<p>418 16 Cluster Analysis
</p>
<p>ways to specify the updating rule, Equation 16.6 is the simplest. For more
sophisticated updating rules, see Kohonen (1995) or Vesanto and Alhoniemi
(2000).
</p>
<p>16.2.4 The Number of Clusters
</p>
<p>Determining the appropriate number of clusters is one of the most diffi-
cult problems in clustering. Sometimes managerial judgment is critical in
deciding the number of clusters even though this tends to be subjective.
For example, the relative sizes of the clusters should be large enough to
be managerially meaningful. The clusters with a couple of subjects may be
treated as outliers and ignored. As another example, marketing managers
often limit the number of clusters because the implementation cost may be
beyond their budgets or the fine-tuned segmentation strategy may not be
feasible.
</p>
<p>We now focus our attention on more formal ways to determine the number
of clusters. The methods for determining the number of clusters depend on
the clustering algorithm being used and there are several criteria available.
However, Milligan and Cooper (1985) showed that the procedure by Calinski
and Harabasz (1974) performed the best among 30 different criteria. Calinski
and Harabasz suggested the following criterion to determine the number of
clusters:
</p>
<p>G(k) = (n&minus; k)(T &minus;W )/(k &minus; 1)W (16.7)
where k is the number of clusters, n is the number of customers, W is
the square sum of the distances of the customers to the center of its
cluster, and T is the square sum of the differences of each customer to
the average customer, essentially, the center of the full data. The opti-
mal number of cluster can be determined by selecting k which returns the
maximum value for G(k), because in that case, W , or the distances be-
tween customers and the center of their clusters, is relatively small com-
pared to T , the distances between customers and the center of the entire
data.
</p>
<p>For probabilistic clustering, there is a more formal way of determining the
optimal number of clusters. Once we apply different numbers of clusters, we
select the number of clusters that will minimize the BIC (Bayesian Infor-
mation Criterion) proposed by Schwarz (1978). The BIC of the probabilistic
clustering with s clusters can be written as
</p>
<p>BICS = &minus;2 log ls +ms log n (16.8)
</p>
<p>where ms is the number of estimated parameters for the model with s clus-
ters and log ls is the corresponding log-likelihood. As the number of clusters
increase, the log-likelihood will increase. However, the penalizing term ms</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16.3 Applying Cluster Analysis 419
</p>
<p>increases at the same time. We choose the model with the optimal number
of clusters that will minimize the BIC.
</p>
<p>16.3 Applying Cluster Analysis
</p>
<p>16.3.1 Interpreting the Results
</p>
<p>The results of a cluster analysis are interpreted by examining the means
for each cluster of the clustering variables, and also examining the means
of any other variable, i.e., &ldquo;discrimination variables,&rdquo; not included in the
clustering routine. For example, we may cluster based on benefits sought but
have a host of other variables, for example demographics, that we use for
interpretation.
</p>
<p>Table 16.3 shows a hypothetical example of a cluster analysis based
on a survey of 500 customers in the personal home computer market.
The clustering was based on benefits sought; all variables measured on a
7-point scale. In addition, there are several demographic and psychographic
variables not used in the cluster analysis, but available as discrimination
variables.
</p>
<p>Interpreting the clusters is a subjective but interesting task that often adds
insight into the nature of the market. In this case, customers in Cluster 1 are
very concerned with &ldquo;ease of use&rdquo; and &ldquo;technical support,&rdquo; and customers in
this cluster are not very likely to own a home computer. This cluster might
be called &ldquo;Novices.&rdquo; Novices would be an attractive segment because they

<p>do not own a computer but fit the age and income profile of a customer who
could use a computer (e.g., comparing to Cluster 2). However, the Novices
might be expensive to serve because they care about ease of use and technical
support, so could end up calling the company&rsquo;s customer service center too
often.
</p>
<p>Customers in Cluster 2 care a lot about ease of use and aesthetics, and
is dominated by families with children. We might call this the &ldquo;Family&rdquo; seg-
ment. Probably the children present leads to the importance of ease of use,
and noting the slightly older age of customers in this cluster, perhaps those
children are teenagers, where aesthetics of the computer could be important.
The Family segment might be attractive for a company like Apple, a company
that excels in aesthetics and design.
</p>
<p>Customers in the third cluster cares a lot about speed, capacity, and reli-
ability, and customers in this cluster use a computer at work as well as own
their own computer. This might be called the &ldquo;Heavy User&rdquo; segment. This
segment would be attractive to a company that can excel on technical spec-
ifications such as speed, and provide capacity and reliability at low cost. In
addition, the cluster analysis classifies 55% of customers in this segment, so
it is the largest segment. Also, the Heavy User segment might be expected
to want to trade up their computer as often as possible to the latest, fastest,
home computer available.
</p>
<p>Note that the interpretations are subjective and make use of both the
clustering and discrimination variables. Note also there are clear manager-
ial implications in that companies with particular strengths could plausibly
target one of these clusters, but probably not all of them (at least with the
same product).
</p>
<p>16.3.2 Targeting the Desired Cluster
</p>
<p>Note that the cluster analysis was based on a survey of 500 consumers. Let&rsquo;s
say the company decided to target the Family segment. The next task &ndash; the
task of database marketing &ndash; would be to figure out how to reach these cus-
tomers. The measurement of benefits sought is unique to the survey. There
are probably no lists available of large numbers of consumers who have an-
swered the same benefits sought questions. However, lists are available of
customers that provide measures of the discrimination variables, since these
are mostly demographics and usage behaviors. For example, to target the
Family segment, one would compile a list of customers that contained most
if not all of the discrimination variables. One might have to purchase dif-
ferent lists and merge them together, or have a company such as Vente
(http://lists.venteinc.com/market) compile the list. One could next proceed
in two ways. One would be to select from the list customers who tend to fit
the profile on the discrimination variables for the Family segment. This could</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16.3 Applying Cluster Analysis 421
</p>
<p>be done heuristically (e.g., select from the list households that own a home
computer and have children present).
</p>
<p>Another approach would be to estimate a predictive model based on
the cluster analysis sample of 500, and apply it to the larger list for which the
discrimination variables are available (see also Chapter 10). For example, one
could use a logistic regression on the sample of 500 to determine whether
or not the customer is in the Family segment, or use a multinomial logit
to predict which of the three segments the customer is in. The dependent
variable would be cluster membership. The independent variables would be
the discrimination variables. Note this model would be estimated on the 500
customers because these are the customers for whom we know cluster mem-
bership. However, once we have the multinomial logit model, we can use it to
&ldquo;score&rdquo; the entire customer list because we have the discrimination variables
in that list. In this way, we could assign all 5,000,000 customers to benefits
sought segments.
</p>
<p>The above example shows how a rich set of measures obtained from
a small sample can be used to identify and target customers among a
larger set. The key to the success of this strategy is the existence of dis-
crimination variables that are available for large numbers of customers.
The small sample has available the clustering variables and the discrimi-
nation variables, while the compiled list has the discrimination variables.
A predictive model or heuristic selection procedure allows the database
marketer to infer the cluster membership of customers of the compiled
list.
</p>
<p>While this procedure is very valuable, it is possible that the clustering vari-
ables might be available for a large list and hence the above process might
not be necessary. For example, consider the case of a company wanting to
start a customer tier program. The company may cluster analyze its cus-
tomers based on various measures of customer value (LTV, responsiveness to
marketing, duration, RFM variables, etc.). It would be impractical to run the
cluster analysis of all its 5,000,000 customers. So the analyst would run the
cluster analysis on say 2000 customers. Then the rest of the customers could
be assigned to a cluster by directly calculating its similarity to each cluster.
This is obviously the most desirable situation. The small-sample &ndash; predictive
model &ndash; compile list &ndash; score list approach obviously has more steps and relies
on coming up with a good predictive model and being able to compile a list
of many customers with data on the discrimination variables. However, many
customer lists are available, and there are companies that specialize in list
compilation, so especially for a customer acquisition scenario, the approach
makes good sense.
</p>
<p>The above illustrates how cluster analysis can be used to interpret seg-
ments, make a targeting decision, and then use database marketing to tar-
get potential members of the sought-after segment. The contribution of
cluster analysis is extremely important to this process. It provides a rich
portrait of how the market might be segmented, and often through the</p>

<p>discrimination variables, how they might be reached. While as we&rsquo;ve dis-
cussed in this chapter, there are many different methods we can use to
form the clusters, the real &ldquo;validation&rdquo; of the technique is in the manage-
rial value of interpreting the clusters, and the targetability and ultimately
the profitability of the segments realized through list creation and predictive
modeling.</p>

<p>Decision Trees
</p>
<p>Abstract Decision trees are a very intuitive, easy-to-implement predictive
modeling technique. They literally can be depicted as a tree &ndash; a sequence of
criteria for classifying customers according to a metric such as likelihood of
response. The pictorial representation of the tree makes it easy to apply and
communicate. This chapter discusses the methods for creating the branches
of the tree, deciding how many branches the tree should have and further
details in constructing decision trees.
</p>
<p>17.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Decision trees have attracted considerable attention both from researchers
and practitioners. For example, the survey paper on decision trees by Murthy
(1998) cites more than 300 references from various disciplines including sta-
tistics, engineering, and decision science. Decision trees become the most
popular data mining tool among managers because of their ability to gener-
ate rules that can easily be expressed visually and in plain English. A decision
tree is often called a regression tree if the dependent variable is quantitative
and a classification tree if it is qualitative.
</p>
<p>The origin of decision trees goes back to the tree-based model called
AID (Automatic Interaction Detection) developed by Morgan and Sonquist
(1963). As the name implies, their original intention is to develop a model that
efficiently identifies interactions among independent variables. In a predictive
modeling context, an interaction exists when the effect of an independent (or
predictor) variable on the dependent variable (customer response, customer
value, etc.) depends on the level of other independent variables. When an in-
teraction exists, the simple additive property of each independent variable in
contributing the dependent variable no longer holds. For example, customer
profitability may increase as a function of income among customers with lower
level of education. However, the same variable may decrease as a function
of income among customers with higher education. Statistically, it becomes
</p>
<p>423</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>424 17 Decision Trees
</p>
<p>a formidable task to incorporate all the interactions among independent
variables as the number of independent variables increases. You need to con-
sider all two-way interactions, three-ways, four-ways, and so on. For example,
with real-world databases consisting of say 100 potential predictors, there
would be 100C2 = (100)(99)/2 = 4, 950 potential two-way interactions and
100C3 = (100)(99)(98)/6 = 161,700 potential three-way interactions! AID was
designed to tackle this complex combinatorial problem in a heuristic way.
</p>
<p>Hartigan (1975) later modified AID, employing a statistically more valid
method of splitting the data into subsets. His model is called CHAID (Chi-
Square Automatic Interaction Detection) because he used the chi-square test
of statistical significance to split the data. Decision trees became even further
popularized among statisticians since Breiman et al. (1984) developed their
decision tree algorithm called CART (Classification and Regression Trees).
Different from CHAID, CART intentionally grows oversized trees and then
prunes some branches using a built-in cross validation procedure to avoid the
possibility of overfitting. Finally, researchers in machine learning began to use
decision trees. For example, Quinlan (1986) constructed his own tree-based
model called C4.5.
</p>
<p>17.2 Fundamentals of Decision Trees
</p>
<p>A decision tree starts with the entire customer dataset and successively splits
it into mutually exclusive discrete subsets, so that each customer is assigned
to one subset or the other. There is exactly one root node that no edges enter.
The root node is the entire dataset. This gets split into two or more children
nodes. These children nodes are successively split until the algorithm decides
the tree is complete. The final children nodes that define the end of the tree
are called terminal (or leaf ) nodes. All children nodes except the root and
terminal nodes are called internal nodes.
</p>
<p>All decision tree algorithms share several aspects in common. The goal is
to build a tree that will allow us to predict the dependent variable (or in
modern technical language, build a classification tree to assign a &ldquo;class&rdquo; for
each observation) based on the values of attributes or independent variables.
Starting from the root node, the decision tree model recursively partitions
(splits) the attribute space into subsets, or children nodes, (e.g., X1 &ge; a ver-
sus X1 &lt; a, where X1 is an independent variable) such that the dependent
variable becomes successively more homogeneous within each subset. After
each split, we are left with two or more internal nodes. The algorithm then
attempts to split these internal nodes into children nodes, using its own cri-
terion function to find the best split. If the value of splitting an internal node
is less than a pre-specified stopping threshold, the internal node will not split
anymore and becomes a terminal node. The tree-growing proceeds until no</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17.2 Fundamentals of Decision Trees 425
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.1 Decision tree for brand preference.
</p>
<p>more internal nodes are left in the tree that are worth splitting. The terminal
nodes of the tree correspond to distinct, mutually exclusive regions of the
attribute space and each observation can be assigned to one of the terminal
nodes.
</p>
<p>Let us give a simple example of the decision tree applied to the predic-
tion of customer&rsquo;s brand preference. We collect survey data from 100 cus-
tomers regarding their brand satisfaction measured in five-point scale (y)
and two independent (predictor) variables, income (x1) and sex (x2). Income
is measured on a continuous scale while sex is a categorical variable (1 if the
customer is a male and 0 if she is a female). The decision tree attempts to
predict customer satisfaction by grouping customers according to their in-
come and sex. The groups are represented in the tree-like structure shown in
Fig. 17.1.
</p>
<p>The root node contains 100 customers with an average satisfaction of 3.2.
The first step is to decide the best way to split income if we are to use income
as the first variable for splitting the root node, and the best way to split sex
if we are to use sex as the first splitting variable. Sex is a categorical variable
with only two categories, so there is only one way to spit it (male versus
female). We therefore know without much thinking how we will split on sex
if we split the root node based on sex.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>426 17 Decision Trees
</p>
<p>Finding the split value for income is nontrivial because it is a continu-
ous variable and so there are many possible splits.1 We first choose a split
value say of $20,000, and assign the 100 customers into two segments: a seg-
ment with income lower than $20,000 and a segment with income higher than
$20,000. Alternatively, you may choose a split value of $30,000, and assign
100 respondents into a group lower than $30,000 and a group higher than
$30,000. The decision tree algorithm selects the best split value in the sense
that the within group variation of Y &rsquo;s is minimized and the between group
variations of Y &rsquo;s is maximized (see Sect. 17.3 for details). In other words,
we divide 100 respondents into two groups using their income levels in such
a way that brand satisfaction of customers within a group are as homoge-
neous as possible while being maximally different from those in the other
group.
</p>
<p>Now that we know the best way of splitting the root node if we use income
as the splitting variable or sex, the next step is to decide which independent
variable better predicts the dependent variable, customer satisfaction. This is
similarly decided by calculating which variable does a better job of minimizing
within group variation of Y &rsquo;s while also maximizing between group variation
(see Sect. 17.3 for details). Because income is the better variable than sex, we
start to draw the tree by splitting the root node into two children nodes, one
with income broken down into two, say, lower than $20,000 and higher than
$20,000.
</p>
<p>We now branch out trees from each of these two internal nodes. Em-
ploying the same splitting rule, we find that the variable sex is the better
feature to split both internal nodes. In the next tree branching stage, three
out of four internal nodes are within the stopping threshold and, hence, be-
come the terminal nodes. Finally, we split one of the four child nodes by
income, leading to two more terminal nodes. The final tree has five terminal
nodes.
</p>
<p>The resulting tree is shown in Fig. 17.1. Each of the five terminal nodes
corresponds to distinct regions of the attribute space. The first terminal node
represents females with income less than $20,000. The second is for males with
income less than $20,000. Other terminal nodes are interpreted similarly.
The terminal nodes represent mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
partitions of the original root node, so each respondents can be classified
into the one and only one of these five terminal nodes. Moving from the root
node to the terminal nodes allows us to predict the satisfaction rating. If
a customer is identified to be female with income less than $20,000, she is
assigned to the first terminal node, and her satisfaction is predicted to be
1.5. On the other hand, the satisfaction rating for a female with her income
greater than $50,000 is predicted to be 5.0.
</p>
<p>The tree in Fig. 17.1 demonstrates an interaction effect between the vari-
able income and sex. Among respondents with the income less than $20,000,
</p>
<p>1 This would also be the case for a categorical variable with several categories. Any two-
category variable, such as sex, is easy because there is only one way to split it.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17.3 Finding the Best Splitting Rule 427
</p>
<p>the preference rating of a male is higher than a female. On the other
hand, a female has the higher preference rating than a male, among re-
spondents with the income greater than $20,000. Depending on the level
of income, the preference rating of a female will be higher or lower than a
male.
</p>
<p>17.3 Finding the Best Splitting Rule
</p>
<p>The most important and widely researched issue in decision trees is to develop
the best &ldquo;splitting rule,&rdquo; that is, the method by which to decide on what
value of the predictor variable should be split. In order to build a tree, it
is necessary to apply at each internal node a testing measure for splitting
the data into two children nodes.2 Researchers have proposed a number of
different splitting metrics. We here review some of the well-known splitting
rules.
</p>
<p>17.3.1 Gini Index of Diversity
</p>
<p>The Gini index has been employed by CART (Breiman et al. 1984) and
SLIQ (Mehta et al. 1996). Generally, a good splitting rule should partition
the data at an internal node and make the data at the child nodes more
&ldquo;pure&rdquo; or homogeneous (in the distribution of the dependent variable y).
Breiman et al. (1984) proposed to define an impurity function i(t) at every
internal node t. Suppose that a potential split S will divide the internal node
t into the two child nodes t1 and t2. And the total number of observations at
the internal node is n, and n1 observations go into t1 and n2 observations goes
to t2. The goodness of the split S is defined to be the decrease in impurity
</p>
<p>∆i(S, t) = i(t)&minus; (n1/n)i(t1)&minus; (n2/n)i(t2) (17.1)
One will choose a split that maximizes ∆i(S, t) over all possible splits S at the
internal node t.3 Or choose a split that minimizes (n1/n)i(t1) + (n2/n)i(t2).
Breiman et al. (1984) suggest the Gini index of diversity as the impurity
function.
</p>
<p>i(t) = 1&minus;
&sum;
</p>
<p>j
p(j|t)2 (17.2)
</p>
<p>2 We limit our attention to the decision tree design with a binary split. However, the
binary split is not really a restriction because any ordered tree was shown to be uniquely
transformed into an equivalent binary tree (Rounds 1980).
</p>
<p>3 In the sequence of values for continuous valued variables, the maximum number of
possible splits is (n &minus; 1) where n is the number of observations. Similarly, the number
of possible splits for categorical variables is (2m &minus; 1) where m is the number of distinct
values.</p>

<p>where p(j|t) is the probability (or the relative frequency) a customer in node
t is in &ldquo;class&rdquo; j (a class is a particular value of the dependent variable).
The Gini index has the minimum value of 0 when all observations belong
to one class and the maximum value of (1 &minus; 1/c) when observations are
evenly distributed across all c classes. In other words, if the split is such
that all customers in a given node t have the same value for the dependent
variable, the customers are perfectly homogeneous and there is no impurity.
However, say there are only two classes or values for the dependent variable,
and p(j|t) = 0.5, that means the homogeneity of the customers in node t is
no better than would be achieved based on random assignment, and impurity
is maximal.
</p>
<p>For illustration, consider the hypothetical data shown in Table 17.1. Sup-
pose we develop a decision tree to predict the response probability to the
direct mailing offer based on two independent variables, sex (male or female)
and income (&ge; $50, 000 or &lt; 50, 000).
</p>
<p>At the root node, the relative frequencies of response with &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and
&ldquo;No&rdquo; is 0.5(= 5/10). Hence, the Gini measure of impurity at the root node
is i(t) = 1&minus; 0.52 &minus; 0.52 = 0.5. To branch out the tree from the root node, we
now have to know which variables would make the data more homogeneous
at the children nodes. First, we calculate the impurity of a split with respect
to sex. There are 10 observations (n = 10): 5 males (n1 = 5) and 5 females
(n2 = 5). Its Gini measures of impurity at the child node are:
</p>
<p>Males : i(t1) = 1&minus; 0.42 &minus; 0.62 = 0.48
Females : i(t2) = 1&minus; 0.62 &minus; 0.42 = 0.48
</p>
<p>Hence, if we choose the split with respect to sex, the decrease in impurity is
</p>
<p>∆i(sex, t) = i(t)&minus; (n1/n)i(t1)&minus; (n2/n)i(t2)
= 0.5&minus; (5/10)(0.48)&minus; (5/10)(0.48) = 0.02
</p>
<p>We similarly calculate the impurity of a split with respect to income. Again,
there are 10 observations (n = 10): 5 high income (n1 = 5) and 5 low income</p>
<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>customers (n2 = 5). The corresponding impurity measures at the child node
are:
</p>
<p>&ge;$50,000: i(t1) = 1&minus; 0.82 &minus; 0.22 = 0.32
&lt;$50,000: i(t2) = 1&minus; 0.22 &minus; 0.82 = 0.32
</p>
<p>Hence, if we choose the split of income variable, the decrease in impurity will
be
</p>
<p>∆i(income, t) = 0.5&minus; (5/10)(0.32)&minus; (5/10)(0.32) = 0.18
Since ∆i(income, t) = 0.18 is greater than ∆i(sex, t) = 0.02, we choose the
split of income variable.
</p>
<p>17.3.2 Entropy and Information Theoretic Measures
</p>
<p>Uncertainty is at its maximum at the root node because a given customer
could belong to any of the classes (values for the dependent variable). As
we move from the root node through the internal nodes down to the ter-
minal node, uncertainty is reduced because we become more certain of the
customer&rsquo;s class. Hence, an objective function for a tree design could be to
minimize uncertainty or maximize entropy reduction from each level to the
next level (Suen and Wang 1984).
</p>
<p>Shannon&rsquo;s entropy is frequently used among various entropy measures be-
cause of its strong additive property. The Shannon&rsquo;s entropy at node t can
be defined as
</p>
<p>Entropy(t) = &minus;
&sum;
</p>
<p>j
p(j|t) log p(j|t) (17.3)
</p>
<p>where p(j|t) is the probability or the relative frequency of class j at node t,
(i.e., the probability a customer in node t has a dependent variable value of j).
The entropy in Equation 17.3 will have the minimum of 0 when all observa-
tions belong to one class and the maximum value of log c when observations
are evenly distributed across all c classes implying least information.4
</p>
<p>Similar to the case of the Gini index, suppose that a potential split S will
divide the internal node t into the two child nodes t1 and t2. And the total
number of observations at the internal node t is n, and n1 observations go
into t1 and n2 observations goes to t2. Then the information gain of splitting
the node t can be defined as
</p>
<p>Gain(t) = Entropy(t)&minus; (n1/n)Entropy(t1)&minus; (n2/n)Entropy(t2) (17.4)
4 The logic is similar to that with the impurity index. If the split has perfect prediction,
p(j|t) will equal 1 for at least one classification, in which case log p(j|t) = 0, and equal
zero for all other classifications. The sum in Equation 17.3 will come out to be zero. If the
split has random prediction, p(j|t) will equal 1/c for all j, in which case Equation 17.3
will sum up to log c.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>430 17 Decision Trees
</p>
<p>Equation 17.4 measures the information gain or the reduction in entropy by
splitting the node t. At the internal node t, you choose the split over all
possible splits S maximizing Equation 17.4.
</p>
<p>Using the hypothetical data shown in Table 17.1, let us demonstrate how
to calculate the information gain measure and determine the best split. Re-
member that the relative frequencies of response (p(j|t)) with &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and
&ldquo;No&rdquo; is 0.5(= 5/10) at the root node. Hence, the Shannon&rsquo;s entropy at the
root node is Entropy(t) = &minus;[(0.5) log(0.5) + (0.5) log(0.5)] = 0.3010. Similar
to the numerical example applied to the Gini measure, we have two candi-
date variables, sex and income, to branch out the tree from the root node.
First, we calculate the entropy of a split with respect to sex. There are 10
observations (n = 10): 5 males (n1 = 5) and 5 females (n2 = 5). Its entropy
measures at the child node are:
</p>
<p>Males: Entropy(t1) = &minus;[(0.4) log(0.4) + (0.6) log(0.6)] = 0.2922
Females: Entropy(t2) = &minus;[(0.6) log(0.6) + (0.4) log(0.4)] = 0.2922
</p>
<p>Therefore, if we choose the split with respect to sex, the information gain
will be
</p>
<p>Gain(t) = 0.3010&minus; (5/10)(0.2922)&minus; (5/10)(0.2922) = 0.0088
Alternatively, if we choose the split of income variable, the corresponding
entropy measures at the child node are:
</p>
<p>&ge;$50,000: Entropy(t1) = &minus;[(0.8) log(0.8) + (0.2) log(0.2)] = 0.0930
&lt;$50,000: Entropy(t2) = &minus;[(0.2) log(0.2) + (0.8) log(0.8)] = 0.0930
</p>
<p>Hence, the information gain for the split with income variable will be
</p>
<p>Gain(t) = 0.3010&minus; (5/10)(0.0930)&minus; (5/10)(0.0930) = 0.2080
The information gain of splitting with respect to income (0.2080) rather than
sex (0.0930) is larger. So we choose the split of income variable.
</p>
<p>The information theoretic measure has been employed by ID3 and C4.5
(Quinlan 1986). It tends to select splits that lead to so many partitions that
the tree becomes unwieldy. Quinlan (1993) overcomes the overfitting problem
by penalizing the number of partitions.
</p>
<p>17.3.3 Chi-Square Test
</p>
<p>The chi-square statistic may be the one of the oldest splitting rules that is
still employed in CHAID (Hartigan 1975; Kass 1983). It is used to test the
statistical significance of the observed association in a cross-tabulation. For
the same example as before, suppose that a potential split S will divide the</p>

</p>
<p>internal node t into two children nodes. Let Njk be the number of customers
in children node k that are in class j, and a dot (&middot;) subscript designate
the sum across nodes or classes as the case may be. The total number of
observations at the internal node t is N.. consisting of N1. observations of
class 1, N2. observations of class 2, and finally Nc. observations of class c. So&sum;c
</p>
<p>j=1 Nj. = N... Now the first child node has N.1 observations consisting of
Nj1 for each class j. Similarly, the second child hasN.2 observations consisting
of Nj2 for each class j. Then the chi-square statistic is defined as
</p>
<p>χ2 =
c&sum;
</p>
<p>j=1
</p>
<p>(Nj1 &minus;Nj.N.1/N..)2
Nj.N.1/N..
</p>
<p>+
c&sum;
</p>
<p>j=1
</p>
<p>(Nj2 &minus;Nj.N.2/N..)2
Nj.N.2/N..
</p>
<p>(17.5)
</p>
<p>where N..(Nj./N..)(N.1/N..) = Nj.N.1/N.. and N..(Nj./N..)(N.2)/N..) =
Nj.N.2/N.. are the expected number of observations from class j in child
nodes 1 and 2 respectively if the observations at the parent node t are ran-
domly assigned to the two child nodes. Hence, a good split will produce the
larger chi-square value.
</p>
<p>Equation 17.5 is known to have the chi-square distribution with (c &minus; 1)
degrees of freedom. We select the split with the largest chi-square value (or
the lowest p-value) among all possible splits S. And we do not split the
internal node t any more if its chi-square value of splitting is not statistically
significant. Finally, an adjusted p-value using the Bonferroni multiplier is
often used because the chi-square tests are sequentially done from the root
node to the terminal nodes.
</p>
<p>Using the hypothetical data shown in Table 17.1, let us demonstrate how
to calculate the chi-square statistics for each independent variable and select
the best split. For the sex variable we get
</p>
<p>χ2 =
(2&minus; 2.5)2
</p>
<p>2.5
+
</p>
<p>(3&minus; 2.5)2
2.5
</p>
<p>+
(3&minus; 2.5)2
</p>
<p>2.5
+
</p>
<p>(2&minus; 2.5)2
2.5
</p>
<p>= 0.4
</p>
<p>whereas for the income variable we get
</p>
<p>χ2 =
(4&minus; 2.5)2
</p>
<p>2.5
+
</p>
<p>(1&minus; 2.5)2
2.5
</p>
<p>+
(1&minus; 2.5)2
</p>
<p>2.5
+
</p>
<p>(4&minus; 2.5)2
2.5
</p>
<p>= 3.6
</p>
<p>That is, the chi-square value for the income split is much larger than for the
sex split. So we choose the split of income variable.
</p>
<p>Note that in this example, whether we use the impurity index, the entropy
measure, or the chi-square measure, the conclusion is the same &ndash; split on the
income variable. However, we cannot guarantee that this always will happen.
There is no reason to prefer one measure over the other, because they all
make good intuitive sense. The best solution is when possible, to try multiple
splitting criteria and verify whether they all lead to the same tree. To the
extent they do reinforces our confidence that the final tree captures real
patterns in the data.</p>

<p>432 17 Decision Trees
</p>
<p>17.3.4 Other Splitting Rules
</p>
<p>There are a number of other splitting rules including Bayes&rsquo; classification rule
(Buntine 1992) and activity-based measure (Moret et al. 1980). Ben-Bassat
(1987) provides a useful taxonomy and Murthy (1998) provides lengthy lists
of references on various splitting rules. So far no dominating splitting rule
seems to emerge. The performance of each splitting rule seems to depend
on various external factors such as the type of application area. However,
Breiman et al. (1984) made an interesting comment that decision tree design
is rather insensitive to a variety of splitting rules, and it is the stopping rule
that is critical.
</p>
<p>17.4 Finding the Right Sized Tree
</p>
<p>Another important and widely researched issue in decision trees is when to
stop growing the tree, i.e., when to stop adding branches. Breslow and Aha
(1996) have surveyed the previous research on tree simplification. See also
Murthy (1998) for references on finding the right sized trees. Here we review
the most popular tree stopping criteria.
</p>
<p>17.4.1 Pruning
</p>
<p>Breiman et al. (1984) have proposed the pruning method to find the right
sized tree and it became the most popular tree stopping method. Given the
data, the strategy is to employ a greedy algorithm to grow a complete tree
in which no more splitting would significantly improve the fitting criterion.
The fully grown tree will have a misclassification error rate close to zero on
the training, or calibration, data. However, its true error rate that should be
measured on the test, or validation, data may be much higher. The fully grown
tree may be overgrown because of the statistical exploitation of particular
observations in the training data. The goal of pruning is to find a simpler tree
that will provide the smallest true error rate. That is, pruning will generalize
the tree and avoid the problem of overfitting.
</p>
<p>In finding the right sized tree, it is often argued that pruning is better
than a stopping threshold approach because it may partially solve the sub-
optimality problem of greedy tree induction (Murthy 1998). For example, if
there is a good node t2 a couple of levels below a not-so-good node t1, the
stopping threshold method will stop growing the tree at node t1. However,
the pruning method will grow the complete tree and prune it back until
node t2.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17.4 Finding the Right Sized Tree 433
</p>
<p>The pruning proceeds in two steps: first generate a number of candidate
sub-trees and select the one of these sub-trees based on their classification
errors. In order to identify a set of candidate sub-trees, Breiman et al. (1984)
introduce the concept of cost complexity that essentially adjusts the misclas-
sification error rate for the complexity of the tree. That is why their pruning
is called the cost complexity pruning method. The adjusted misclassification
error rate is defined as
</p>
<p>Adj-e(S) = e(S) + αλ(S) (17.6)
</p>
<p>where e(S) is the (original) misclassification error rate at the candidate tree
S, α is the penalty parameter (α &ge; 0) imposed on the tree complexity or size,
and λ(S) is the number of terminal nodes (or &ldquo;leaves&rdquo;) in the candidate tree
S. The larger value assigned to α implies the heavier penalty imposed on a
sizable tree. If α is zero, the fully grown tree will have the lowest adjusted
misclassification error. Now the value of α is gradually increased. Given α1,
the adjusted error rates of all sub-trees are evaluated. If the adjusted error
rate of a sub-tree is lower than that of the fully grown tree, the sub-tree
becomes the candidate sub-tree α1 and all branches that are not part of the
sub-tree will be pruned. Then given α2 &gt; α1, the adjusted error rates of all
sub-trees of the tree α1 are evaluated and the candidate sub-tree α2 will be
found. This sequence proceeds until the final sub-tree is the root node. As the
value of α increases, the procedure will generate a set of candidate sub-trees
α1, α2, and so on.
</p>
<p>To illustrate, consider a hypothetical example shown in Fig. 17.2. If the
terminal node contains customers belonging to only one class, it assumes to
be allocated to the class. When the terminal node includes customers from
several different classes, the customers at the terminal node are examined
and the terminal node assumes to be allocated to the class which occurs most
frequently. The tree has 4 terminal nodes: nodes 2, 5, 6, and 4. There are 28
</p>
<p>Fig. 17.2 Pruning decision trees.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>434 17 Decision Trees
</p>
<p>customers in node 2. Eight are class 1 customers, 8 class 2 customers, and 10
class 3 customers. Hence, node 2 is predicted to be in class 2. Therefore, 16 out
of 28 customers are wrongly classified. Similarly, node 5 is predicted to be in
class 1, node 6 in class 2, and node 4 in class 1. Hence, 10 out of 50 customers
in node 5 and 2 out of 14 customers in node 4 are misclassified. None of the
10 customers in node 6 is wrongly classified. Hence, the misclassification error
rate (or e(S)) of the full tree (Tree I) is 28/100 = 0.28 and its number of
terminal nodes (or λ(S)) is 4. Next, consider the tree with node 5 and 6
pruned (Tree II). The resulting tree has 3 terminal nodes: node 2, 3 and 4.
So its λ(S) is 3. Node 2 is predicted to be in class 3, node 3 in class 1, and
node 4 in class 1. Therefore, its misclassification error rate is 38/100 = 0.38.
Finally, consider the completely pruned tree only with node 1 (Tree III). Its
λ(S) is 1 and node 1 is predicted to be in class 1. Its misclassification error
rate is 40/100 = 0.40.
</p>
<p>With 0 &le; α &lt; 0.04, the Adj-e(S) of Tree I is the smallest. With 0.04 &le; α,
the Adj-e(S) of Tree III is the smallest. Hence, a set of candidate sub-trees
are Tree I and Tree III.
</p>
<p>Once we determine the set of candidate (pruned) sub-trees, we select the
sub-tree with the lowest misclassification error rate applied to the hold-
out sample. The holdout sample of the data is often a portion of the
data that is set aside exclusively for pruning. It is typical to observe that
the error rate initially decreases as the number of terminal nodes λ(S),
i.e., the tree complexity, increases. And beyond a certain point, the er-
ror rate increases as the tree complexity increases. That is, the best sub-
tree is often in the middle, neither a naive simple tree nor an overly
complex one.
</p>
<p>The pruning method performs very well with the holdout sample. How-
ever, if the size of the data is limited, Breiman et al. (1984) suggest using a
cross-validation that does not require reserving a portion of a training data
for pruning. Pointing out some problems associated with the cross-validation,
researchers have suggested alternative ways of using samples including a boot-
strap method (Crawford 1989) and an efficient iterative tree growing and
pruning (Gelfand et al. 1991).
</p>
<p>17.4.2 Other Methods for Finding the Right Sized Tree
</p>
<p>Several alternative techniques have been suggested for obtaining right sized
trees even though pruning the most popular. The earliest method may be
to restrict on minimum node size. A node is not split if it has smaller than
k customers where k is a parameter to the tree induction algorithm. This
strategy is known not to be robust (Friedman 1977). However, it may be
managerially useful to set the minimum size for segments.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>17.5 Other Issues in Decision Trees 435
</p>
<p>Another method of finding a right sized tree is to set a threshold stopping
value on the value of splitting criterion. If the splitting criterion at the internal
node t is greater (or smaller) than the specified threshold, the internal node
becomes the terminal node. For example, if we are using the chi-squared
splitting criterion, we can require that the chi-square p-value be less than
0.10 in order for there to be a split, and stop when the p-values at each
terminal node are greater than 0.10. The problem, however, is that this does
not guard against over-fitting, which is why pruning methods are popular. If
the researcher does not want to use a formal pruning method, at a minimum,
the predictive ability of the tree obtained using a threshold stopping rule
should be tested on holdout data to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t decrease too much.
</p>
<p>Thresholds can be imposed on local (i.e., individual node) goodness or on
global (i.e., entire tree) goodness. The problem with the local threshold is
that the value of most splitting criteria vary with the size of the calibration
sample. Imposing a single threshold that is meaningful at all nodes in the
tree is not easy and may not even be possible (Murthy 1998).
</p>
<p>Finally, Mehta et al.&rsquo;s (1996) SLIQ (Supervised Learning In Quest) em-
ploys an alternative pruning method called MDL (minimum description
length) based on pruning that is essentially a generalization of Breiman&rsquo;s
approach described in Equation 17.6. The MDL principle states that the best
model for encoding the data is the one that minimizes the sum of the cost
of describing the data using the model and the cost of describing the model.
They define the total cost of description as
</p>
<p>Cost(Model,Data) = Cost(Data |Model) + Cost(Model) (17.7)
That is, the total cost of description is the sum of the cost of describing a
model and the cost of describing data that are exceptions to this model. The
best model will be the one with the lowest description cost. In the case of
decision trees, the alternative models may be viewed as the set of sub-trees
made available as a result of pruning, and the data are the set of observations
from which the full tree is initially built (Apte and Weiss 1997). SLIQ utilizes
the classification error as the cost of describing the data for a given tree.
The cost for describing the model (or a tree) is formulated as a recursive
combination of the cost of creating a node and the cost of splitting that
node. The total cost at each node in a fully grown tree is then used to prune
the node back to a leaf node, or to prune its left sub-tree, or right sub-tree,
or leave it unchanged.
</p>
<p>17.5 Other Issues in Decision Trees
</p>
<p>We briefly discuss some other issues in decision trees besides finding the best
splitting rule and the right sized tree.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>436 17 Decision Trees
</p>
<p>17.5.1 Multivariate Splits
</p>
<p>All the decision trees discussed so far split the internal node into children
nodes based on a single attribute. For example, suppose that X is the vector
of predictors/features, X = (x1, x2, . . . , xp)
</p>
<p>&prime;. For qualitative predictors, the
splitting rule is based on the split value s, and assigns observations for which
a single predictor {xi &gt; s} or {xi &le; s} to the left or right child node respec-
tively.5 Now we extend the splitting rule into the multivariate case in which
{h(X) &gt; s} is assigned to the left and {h(X) &le; s} to the right child node.
</p>
<p>Most of previous research on multivariate splits consider that h(X) is
(oblique) linear. Still the problem of finding an optimal linear split is much
more difficult than that of finding a split with a single variable, since there
is a much larger space of splits to be searched. In fact, finding optimal linear
splits is known to be intractable for some tasks, so heuristic methods are
required for finding good, albeit suboptimal, linear splits (Murthy 1998).6
</p>
<p>There are a number of methods available for finding an optimal linear com-
binations including linear discriminant analysis, hill climbing search, linear
programming, and so on.
</p>
<p>17.5.2 Cost Considerations
</p>
<p>In real world application, the costs of misclassification vary from class to class,
and the costs of collecting/measuring features are different across features.
An easy way of incorporating the asymmetric misclassification costs is to use
the prior probabilities or cost matrices (Breiman et al. 1984). That is, simply
weight the error rate with the weights given by the cost of each misclassifica-
tion. Alternatively, researchers suggest including a cost term into the feature
evaluation criterion in order to incorporate attribute measurement costs.
</p>
<p>17.5.3 Finding an Optimal Tree
</p>
<p>The intrinsic difficulty in finding the &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; tree is that there are so many
possible trees. The decision tree algorithms discussed in this chapter use
a greedy approach. They grow a tree by sequentially creating nodes using
splitting rules based on maximizing some fitting criterion, and then prune it
</p>
<p>5 Multivariate split should not be confused with higher-order splits for a single variable
(e.g., for income, &lt;$30,000, $30,000 to $100,000, &gt;$100,000). Multivariate split is based
on the splitting rule using more than two variables (e.g., sex = female and income
&gt;$30,000).
</p>
<p>6 The problem of finding an optimal linear split should not be confused with the problem
of finding optimal linear combinations of weights in discriminant analysis.</p>

<p>17.6 Application to a Direct Mail Offer 437
</p>
<p>back to avoid over-fitting. This generates a sequence of trees each of which is
an extension of the previous tree. Several authors pointed out the inadequacy
of greedy algorithms since it may lead to sub-optimal solutions.
</p>
<p>Several approaches have been proposed to improve upon the greedy al-
gorithm. For example, researchers have incorporated a feature of partial or
exhaustive look-ahead to improve the greedy tree induction (Chou 1991; Bun-
tine 1992). However, they did not provide the convincing evidence that the
look-ahead would outperform the greedy tree induction.
</p>
<p>17.6 Application to a Direct Mail Offer
</p>
<p>Decision trees have widely used among database marketers. For illustration,
we summarize an application by Haughton and Oulabi (1997). Their goal is
to identify prospects who are less likely to respond to a direct mail package
in order to suppress their names from future mailings. The data consist of
316,068 customers: 3,319 respondents and 312,749 non-respondents. Indepen-
dent variables included in the application are age, gender, total number of
mailings, number of mailings in the last 6 months, number of consecutive
mailings, and so on. For comparison, two types of decision trees (CHAID and
CART) are applied to the same data.
</p>
<p>Figure 17.3 represents the estimated CART tree and Fig. 17.4 represents
the CHAID tree built on the same data. In the trees, GEO1 (% Spanish ori-
gin), GEO2 (% Oriental) and SGEO (median household income) denote three
US census geodemographic variables. The variables MAIL6MNTHS (number
of mailing in the last 6 months), MAILTOT (total number of mailings), and
CONS MAIL (number of consecutive mailings) are related to mailing history.
The variable SUMLIST is the number of lists a customer appears on. AGE
IND is 1 if the actual age is on the file, 2 if the age was inferred, and 3 if the
age is missing.
</p>
<p>The trees are not identical by any means but there are similarities. In
both trees, AGE is a strong predictor of response. They both attempt to
split the less responsive age groups with a combination of geodemographic
and mailing history variables. Both trees suggest interactions between AGE
and the geodemographic and mailing history variables, and the CHAID tree
implies a possible interaction between AGE and GENDER. However, the fact
that the trees are different on several of the specifics shows that the specific
algorithm makes a difference in the final tree.
</p>
<p>Table 17.2 shows the (weighted) response rates per decile of the validation
file, once the customers have been ordered from the most responsive to the
least responsive. The gains tables constructed from the CART model and
the CHAID model are remarkably similar. The response rate for the top
decile is 1.77% (higher than 1.08% overall response rate) for both models.
Coupled with the observation above that the trees themselves are different</p>

<p>Fig. 17.3 CART tree for direct mailing drop.
</p>
<p>on several specifics, perhaps these results illustrate that there may not be a
single &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; tree, that several trees can produce more or less the same
results. These trees will typically find similar most-important variables (e.g.,
age and mailing history) but may not split them the same way and may find
different &ldquo;moderate-importance&rdquo; variables.

machine learning (Brown et al. 1993; see Murthy (1998) for more references).
These research studies indicated that there were no dominant techniques in
terms of predictive accuracy.7
</p>
<p>Several advantages of decision trees have been pointed out (Berry and
Linoff 1997; Murthy 1998).
</p>
<p>1. Decision trees generate rules that can be easily expressed visually and in
plain English. They are easy to understand. This is very important in
obtaining senior management &ldquo;buy-in,&rdquo; and in situations where discrim-
ination based on age, gender, or race, is regulated and the role of these
variables in targeting customers needs to be transparent. Because of deci-
sion trees are so transparent and simple, they became one of the most-loved
data mining tools among managers.
</p>
<p>2. Decision trees do not require a lot of assumptions on models and/or data.
They are invariant to monotone transformation of predictor variables and
robust to outliers of predictors. And they can easily handle interactions
among independent variables. They are non-parametric in nature and can
be applied to a wide range of data distributions. Moreover, they can handle
multi-modal data in similar fashion to uni-modal data.
</p>
<p>3. They are easy to implement. Extensive background in statistics is not
required to build trees.
</p>
<p>However, care should be taken in applying decision trees. Decision trees
are essentially developed as an exploratory data mining tool. Still a lot
of technical components associated with decision trees are heuristic. Re-
searchers in decision trees often experiment several variations of the previous
</p>
<p>7 Researchers who have recently developed new techniques (e.g., support vector machines,
bagging and boosting, and radial-basis function networks) often compared their ap-
proaches to traditional methods such as decision trees, and showed advantages of their
methods in predictive performance. However, more objective comparisons in various
situations are still required to conclude which one is better.</p>

</p>
<p>approach until they find a heuristic that works. Decision trees might be con-
sidered a starting point of the modeling process. A more formal statistical
model would follow. In addition, there is a loss of information with deci-
sion trees in that people are grouped as homogeneous when they are not
(e.g., all people with income &gt;$50,000 might be grouped together) whereas
in fact there is a linear relationship between income and the dependent
variable.</p>

<p>Artificial Neural Networks
</p>
<p>Abstract Neural network models are intriguing because they are based on
the intuitive notion of mimicking the structure of neurons that constitute the
human brain. More importantly to database marketers, neural networks can
provide great flexibility in handling non-linearities and variable-interactions
that can be important in predictive modeling applications. We describe the
neural net model, how it is estimated, and more advanced forms of neural
networks.
</p>
<p>18.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Artificial neural networks (ANN) are one of the most powerful tools in data
mining. Based on a model analogous to the human brain, ANNs &ldquo;learn&rdquo; and
generalize from external inputs. When exposed to &ldquo;training observations&rdquo;,
neural networks discover patterns and relationships. Their approach is fun-
damentally different from the way that traditional digital computers solve
problems. Taking a top-down approach, computers solve problems as com-
manded by a series of instructions supplied by humans. In contrast, ANNs
take a bottom-up approach, learning from examples and searching for pat-
terns to infer important relationships.
</p>
<p>18.1.1 Historical Remarks
</p>
<p>Artificial neural networks have a long history. The basic idea dates to
McCulloch and Pitts (1943) who developed a model to explain how bio-
logical neurons work. McCulloch was a neuroscientist and Pitts was a math-
ematician. Combining studies in neurophysiology and mathematical logic,
they attempted to explain how the human brain works and described the
logical calculus of neural networks (Berry and Linoff 1997; Haykin 1999).
</p>
<p>443</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>444 18 Artificial Neural Networks
</p>
<p>Considered the founders of neural networks and artificial intelligence, Mc-
Culloch and Pitts demonstrated that a network with a sufficient number of
neurons and synaptic connections could compute any computable function.
Hence, everything that can be done with a computer can be done with a
neural network. Their model provided a new approach to solving various
decision-making problems even though their original goal was to study how
human brains worked.
</p>
<p>There were not many applications of neural networks by the 1980s, partly
because of limited computing power and a theoretical deficiency of the orig-
inal neural network model noted by Minsky and Papert (1969). The recent
growth in applying neural networks is generally agreed to be due to the pa-
per by Hopfield (1982) and the book edited by Rumelhart and McClelland
(1986). Using ideas from statistical physics, Hopfield overcame the theoretical
weaknesses of McCulloch and Pitt&rsquo;s model. In addition, the well-known book,
Parallel Distributed Processing, edited by Rumelhart and McClelland popu-
larized the back-propagation algorithm that made neural networks practical.

<p>18.1.2 ANN Applications in Database Marketing
</p>
<p>The area of artificial neural networks is multidisciplinary. Researchers from
neurophysiology, statistics, mathematics, computer science and engineering
have contributed to the development of its concept and methodology. Accord-
ingly, neural networks find applications in various fields including pattern
recognition, signal processing and control, speech recognition, fraud detec-
tion, demand forecasting, and so on. By the 1990s, there were more than one
hundred applications to business problems alone (Sharda 1994; Wong et al.
1995)
</p>
<p>Since artificial neural networks comprise a class of general-purpose tools,
there are many published applications to marketing. ANNs were compared
to traditional econometric models in forecasting aggregate market demand
(e.g., Hruschka 1993; Gruca et al. 1999). ANNs were also applied to market
segmentation (Fish et al. 1995; Balakrishnan et al. 1996; Hruschka and Natter
1999), target mailing (Zahavi and Levin 1997) and other marketing problems
(Yao et al. 1998; Knott et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>ANNs can be applied to classification, prediction and clustering tasks
that are all about what database marketing modelers do. For example,
Balakrishnan et al. (1996) applied neural nets to market segmentation. The
data employed in their study represent the brand switching probabilities on 18
different coffee brands for each of 207 households. They employed the neural
net to cluster these 207 households represented by a vector of switching prob-
abilities for 18 brands of coffee. Similarly, Hruschka and Natter (1999) em-
ployed neural networks to cluster 831 housewives. Each housewife was distin-
guished in her usage of household cleaner brands, demographic characteristics</p>

<p>18.1 Introduction 445
</p>
<p>(age, household size, number of children, housewife&rsquo;s education, etc.) and her
attitude variables (e.g., cleaning the household is cumbersome).
</p>
<p>ANNs have also been applied to find target customers. Zahavi and Levin
(1997) explored the feasibility of using neural networks as a means for
targeting audiences for promotion through the mail, from a house list.
Knott et al. (2002) applied neural nets to predict which product a customer
was most likely to buy next, given the set of products the customer already
owned. They applied the approach to a retail bank trying to identify cus-
tomers who would be receptive to a certain type of loan. They found in a
field test that the approach generated more profits than the heuristic ap-
proach the company was currently using. On the other hand, Kim et al.
(2005) proposed an approach to employ ANNs guided by genetic algorithms
for targeting households. They applied their procedure to a solicitation of
9,822 European households to buy insurance for recreational vehicles. Their
model performed better than traditional logistic regression (with a princi-
pal component analysis) in targeting households interested in purchasing the
insurance policy.
</p>
<p>18.1.3 Strengths and Weaknesses
</p>
<p>There are several driving forces contributing to the wide applications of ANNs
for the last 2 decades. The broad availability of high-speed computing allows
a sophisticated model like ANN to be handled within a reasonable amount
of time. In addition, practitioners without strong statistical knowledge can
implement ANNs due to the availability of off-the-shelf neural nets software.1
</p>
<p>More importantly, neural nets are no longer treated as black boxes. Statis-
ticians have shown that ANNs are highly nonlinear regression models and a
number of traditional statistical models such as linear and logistic regression
are special cases of ANNs (White 1989, 1992). As a result, practitioners can
be comfortable in employing ANNs because we know they are closely related
to traditional statistical models.
</p>
<p>Some commercial software vendors often mislead users by exaggerating
the automatic features of their products. However, like the application of
formal statistical techniques, successful applications of ANNs require deep
understanding of neural net theory and their application domains. The user&rsquo;s
subjective judgments will get involved in determining the network architec-
ture and training parameters. Special care should be taken to check the

are available in SAS Enterprise Miner. Neural Connection from SPSS also delivers all the
tools of neural network modeling for prediction, classification and time-series analysis.

larly adapted to database marketing prediction applications.</p>

</p>
<p>performance of neural nets in the validation sample since ANN tends to
overfit the training samples (see Chapter 11).
</p>
<p>Several researchers compared ANNs with established statistical tech-
niques such as clustering, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, time-series
methods, decision trees etc. and found ANNs to be superior. For example,
Fish et al. (1995) compared neural nets with discriminant analysis and lo-
gistic regression for industrial market segmentation. Neural nets were found
to achieve higher hit ratios on the holdout sample than the other statistical
techniques. Hruschka and Natter (1999) compared the clustering performance
of ANNs to the K-means clustering technique and found that ANNs were
better.2 Time series forecasts produced by neural nets were compared with
forecasts from six statistical time series methods (Hill et al. 1996). Across
monthly and quarterly time series, the neural nets did significantly better
than traditional time series methods. ANNs were particularly effective for
discontinuous time series data.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, other researchers have not been able to show the supe-
riority of ANNs over traditional statistical techniques. For example, Zahavi
and Levin (1997) compared neural nets with logistic regression for targeting
customers for promotional mailing offers. Their results showed that the fit
achieved for both methods was approximately the same but the interpreta-
tion was easier for logistic regression. Brown et al. (1993) compared back-
propagation neural networks with decision trees on three problems that are
known to be multi-modal. Their results suggested that there was not much
difference between both methods. Comparing ANN (multilayer perceptrons)
with decision trees (CART), Atlas et al. (1990) also found that there was
not much difference in accuracy. Balakrishnan et al. (1996) compared neural
nets with K-means algorithm and found that there was not much difference
between two methods. However, a combination of the two methodologies,
wherein the results of the neural nets are input as seeds to the K-means,
provided more insightful segmentation schemes. More recently, Linder et al.
(2004) compared neural nets with decision trees and logistic regression in
simulated direct marketing data. ANNs outperformed the other two methods
when the sample size was small, but decision trees and logistic regression
yielded better results when sample size was large &ndash; with logistic regression
being generally superior to decision trees. These results are rather surprising,
because in other research simple models tend to outperform more complex
models with small number of training examples or highly noisy data (Hastie
et al. 2001).
</p>
<p>Summarizing, we conclude that the relative performance of ANNs to tra-
ditional statistical methods depends on the types of data and applications.
The main strength of ANNs lies in their ability to model highly nonlinear
relationships and interactions with few a priori assumptions specified. Hence,
</p>
<p>2 Their neural net model is not the self-organizing maps described in Clustering chapter.
They constructed a feed-forward artificial neural network specially designed in solving
the problem of cluster-based market segmentation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.2 Models of Neurons 447
</p>
<p>ANNs have been shown to outperform traditional statistical techniques when
there exist highly nonlinear relationships and/or when there are significant
interactions among independent variables (Rumelhart and McClelland 1986;
Hill et al. 1996). If the true relationship is linear (or logistic), the linear (or
logistic) regression will work better than an unnecessarily complex neural
network because its linearity (or logistic) assumption functions like addi-
tional prior information. On the other hand, when the true relationship is
complex, ANNs may outperform linear (or logistic) regression because the
wrong assumption made in linear (logistic) regression will bias its result.
More extensive research is required to find the areas of marketing problems
in which ANNs can have unique advantages. From a practical standpoint,
neural nets have certainly proven that belong in the &ldquo;consideration set&rdquo; of
database marketers, especially under the conditions mentioned above. Our
recommendation is the same as with the potential application of any statisti-
cal technique &ndash; apply the neural net and the incumbent method to the same
data, and see which does better on the holdout data.
</p>
<p>18.2 Models of Neurons
</p>
<p>In this section we present a general model of an artificial neural network.
In Sect. 18.3, we will focus on the most commonly used specific form, the
multilayer perceptron. In Sect. 18.4, we describe another specific form, the
radial-basis function network, which is currently less popular than the mul-
tilayer perceptron but has much potential.
</p>
<p>Artificial neural networks are composed of basic units designed to mimic
the behavior of biological neurons. ANN&rsquo;s are analogous to an organism&rsquo;s
nervous system: stimuli or &ldquo;inputs,&rdquo; if they are strong enough, cause neurons
to fire off, in turn causing the organism to respond. In statistical terms, the
inputs are the independent variables and response is the output or dependent
variable. Neural nets can handle both categorical and continuous data, both
for independent and dependent variables.3 Output variables can involve just
one response, or more than one (e.g., whether the customer will respond to a
catalog, and if so, how much will the customer spend). As shown in Fig. 18.1,
a neuron is an information-processing unit that translates input signals into
</p>
<p>3 Categorical data can be handled in two ways. The first is to treat each categorical
feature as discrete, ordered value. For example, we assign 0.0 for brand A, 0.5 for brand
B, and 1.0 for brand C for the brand choice variable with three brands. This method is
somewhat problematic since the neural net will assume that the codes are ordered (i.e.,
brand A and C is far apart). The second way of handling categorical features, which is
more popular, is to represent the categories by a set of dummy variables. For example,
we create brand A, brand B and brand C dummies for the three-brand choice variable.
Each brand dummy will take the value of 1.0 if the brand is chosen, and 0.0 otherwise.
And for identification, one of the dummy variables is dropped before estimation.</p>

</p>
<p>outputs. There are three basic elements of any neural network model: synaptic
weights, the summation function and the activation function.
</p>
<p>Input xj is connected to neuron k by a synaptic weight wkj . Assigning
different weights on each input implies that the importance or the strength
of each input is different in producing an output. Input values with their
weights are combined by a summation or combination function
</p>
<p>&sum;
. The most
</p>
<p>popular function is the linear combination function that can be written as
</p>
<p>vk =
m&sum;
j=0
</p>
<p>wkjxj = wk0x0 + uk (18.1)
</p>
<p>where x0 is set to be one. That is, the linear combination function is the
weighted sum of all input values, where each weight is given by its synaptic
weight. Note also that the above linear combination function contains a term
x0 = 1 with its associated weight of wk0. The term wk0 plays a role of
applying an affine transformation to the value of uk (Haykin 1999). It has
the effect of increasing or decreasing the net input of the activation function
(uk), depending on whether wk0 is positive or negative, respectively. In other
words, its role is similar to that of the intercept term in linear regression.
</p>
<p>Another important element in the neuronal model is the activation func-
tion that transforms the value from the combination function into the output.
That is, yk = ϕ(vk) where yk is the output of the neuron k and ϕ(&middot;) is the
activation function. Its major role is to limit the amplitude of the output of a
neuron. Typically, the range of the normalized amplitude for the output of a
neuron is written as the closed unit interval [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. There are several
types of activation functions: the linear, threshold, piecewise-linear, logistic</p>

<p>and hyperbolic tangent (Berry and Linoff 1997; Haykin 1999). Figure 18.2
shows the shapes of these five activation functions.
</p>
<p>For the threshold activation function, the output unit takes on the value
of one if the value of vk is nonnegative, and zero otherwise (see Fig. 18.2(a)).
That is,
</p>
<p>ϕ(vk) =
</p>
<p>{
1 if vk &ge; 0
0 if vk &lt; 0
</p>
<p>(18.2)
</p>
<p>The model by McCulloch and Pitts (1943) employed this threshold func-
tion. And the threshold function is commonly called as a Heaviside function
(Haykin 1999).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>450 18 Artificial Neural Networks
</p>
<p>Figure 18.2(b) shows the shape of the piecewise linear function that can
algebraically be written as
</p>
<p>ϕ(vk) =
</p>
<p>⎧⎪⎨⎪⎩
1 if vk &ge; 0.5
vk if &minus; 0.5 &lt; vk &lt; 0.5
0 if vk &le; &minus;0.5
</p>
<p>(18.3)
</p>
<p>The piecewise linear function approximates the nonlinear logistic function
in a linear form. The choice of the lower and the upper limit for the linear
region (e.g., &minus;0.5 and 0.5 in Fig. 18.2(b)) is up to the user. The piecewise
linear function generalizes both the threshold and linear activation functions.
It becomes the threshold function if we make the upper limit to be very close
to the lower limit so that the linear region vanishes. Alternatively, if we do
not specify the upper and lower saturation ranges, it will become the linear
function shown in Fig. 18.2(d).
</p>
<p>The S-shaped logistic function is the most frequently used activation func-
tion in ANNs. Its functional form shown in Fig. 18.2(c) is defined as
</p>
<p>ϕ(vk) =
1
</p>
<p>1 + exp(&minus;αvk) (18.4)
</p>
<p>where α is the slope parameter of the logistic function. The logistic function
exhibits linear behavior when the absolute value of vk is small. However, as
it gets larger, the logistic function gradually approaches either 0 or 1. This
property of gradual saturation is a reasonable one in modeling various social
(and natural) phenomena. Moreover, different from the piecewise linear, the
logistic has an attractive mathematical property of differentiability.
</p>
<p>Finally, the hyperbolic tangent function is different from the logistic func-
tion in that its range of the activation function is from &minus;1 to 1 instead of 0
to 1. Shown in Fig. 18.2(e), the hyperbolic tangent is S-shaped similar to the
logistic function, but the lower saturation is negative one rather than zero.
The hyperbolic tangent function is defined as
</p>
<p>ϕ(vk) = a tanh(bvk) (18.5)
</p>
<p>where a and b are the parameters controlling the shape of the hyperbolic
tangent. With suitable values for a and b (e.g., a = 1.7159 and b = 2/3),
the activation function becomes anti-symmetric, that is ϕ(&minus;vk) = &minus;ϕ(vk).
The logistic function does not have this property. ANNs can learn faster when
the activation function is anti-symmetric (LeGun et al. 1991).

<p>18.3 Multilayer Perceptrons

<p>In this section we study the most commonly used class of artificial neural
networks, multilayer feed-forward networks. This network is especially useful</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.3 Multilayer Perceptrons 451
</p>
<p>Fig. 18.3 Multilayer feed-forward network.
</p>
<p>for prediction and classification tasks among others. We start our discussion
with the &ldquo;topology&rdquo; or &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; of the multilayer perceptron, followed
by its method of training, and the back-propagation algorithm. We then dis-
cuss more advanced issues in multilayer perceptrons: how to determine the
number of neurons in the hidden layer, and the optimal value for learning
rate and momentum parameters. This section also describes issues on trans-
formation of input values and model validation.
</p>
<p>18.3.1 Network Architecture
</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways to classify network architectures. A pri-
mary differentiator is single-layer networks versus multilayer networks. Single-
layer networks only consist of an input layer and an output layer, whereas
multilayer networks have one or more hidden layers, as shown in Fig. 18.3.
The networks can also be classified by the presence of at least one feedback
loop. The networks without any feedback loop are called feed-forward net-
works where there is only one-way flow from input units to output units.
Otherwise, they are called recurrent networks.
</p>
<p>Figure 18.4 show an example of a recurrent network in which there are
two inputs, two hidden neurons and an output. One feedback connection
originates from the output and two feedbacks come out of hidden neurons.
The presence of feedback loops can explain different learning capability of
the network. For example, the feedback loops shown in Fig. 18.4 have the
unit-delay term z&minus;1 which incorporates dynamic learning behavior. The re-
current networks have typically been applied to (dynamic) time-series models
such as adaptive equalization of communication channels, speech processing,
plant control, and automobile engine diagnostics (Haykin 1999). Recurrent</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 18.4 Recurrent networks (From Haykin 1999).
</p>
<p>networks have not been applied to database marketing problems, possibly
because fewer dynamic models have been employed in database marketing
applications. However, there are potential applications in areas such as multi-
campaign management (see Chapter 28).
</p>
<p>Returning now to the more commonly applied feed-forward multilayer
neural network, also called the multilayer perceptron, Fig. 18.3 shows a typ-
ical structure. It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and
an output layer. The multilayer perceptron in Fig. 18.3 has three input val-
ues (or independent variables in traditional regression models), one hidden
layer, and one output value (or dependent variable). The hidden layer has
two neurons. Hence, the multilayer perceptron in Fig. 18.3 is referred to as
a 3-2-1 network. Finally, we say that the network is fully connected in that
every node in each layer of the network is connected to every other node in
the next or forward layer.
</p>
<p>Positioned between the input and output layers, hidden layers translate the
independent variables into a prediction of the dependent variables. Hidden
layers are required for the ANN to model complicated interactions among
input variables and other nonlinear relationships (Haykin 1999). As described
above, a single-layer perceptron does not have hidden layers, but directly
connects the input to the output layer.
</p>
<p>Theoretically, a network can have any number of hidden layers. A network
with a large number of hidden layers may be able to capture highly com-
plicated relationships between inputs and outputs. However, a network with
one hidden layer is frequently used for at least two reasons. First, a network</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.3 Multilayer Perceptrons 453
</p>
<p>with a large number of hidden layers may over fit the data and just capture
random noise in the data. We want to make our model as simple as possible
to avoid the problem of overfitting. More importantly, researchers employ the
network with one hidden layer without hesitation because of the &ldquo;universal
approximation theorem&rdquo;. The theorem roughly states that a single hidden
layer is sufficient for a multilayer perceptron to approximate any continuous
relationship between inputs and outputs (Barron 1993; Haykin 1999).4
</p>
<p>We now write the neural network in algebraic form for the discussion of
back-propagation algorithm in the next section. To avoid notational complex-
ity, we limit our discussion to the multilayer perceptron example in Fig. 18.3.
Three input signals come into the input layer pass forward through the net-
work, and produce an output signal at the end. Let a training sample of size
N be denoted by (x1,x2,x3,d). Three input vector x1,x2, and x3 represent
the input layer and the output (response) vector d represents the output
layer.
</p>
<p>Neurons in the hidden layer perform two functions: combination and acti-
vation. Each neuron in the hidden layers receives the input values (x1, x2, x3)
from the input layer, applies the weighted summation and activation func-
tions, and sends the resulting values (h1, h2) to the output layer. More specif-
ically, neuron 1 in the hidden layer receives the input values (x1, x2, x3) from
the input layer and their associated weights are (w11, w12, w13) respectively.
Similarly, neuron 2 in the hidden layer receives the input values (x1, x2, x3)
from the input layer and their associated weights are (w21, w22, w23) respec-
tively. The combination function calculates the weighted sum of the input
values. The resulting intermediate value vj(j = 1, 2) is written as
</p>
<p>vj =
3&sum;
</p>
<p>i=0
</p>
<p>wjixi (18.6)
</p>
<p>where j labels the hidden layer neuron, x0 = 1 and wj0 is intercept term.
Applying the activation function, we have the output value for neuron j
equal to hj = ϕ(vj). For example, if a logistic activation function is applied,
hj = 1/[1 + exp(wj0 +wj1x1 +wj2x2 +wj3x3)]. The resulting output values
h1 and h2 become the input values to the output layer. Given a logistic ac-
tivation function, the output value y = ϕ(v3) = 1/[1 + exp(w30h0 +w31h1 +
w32h2)] where h0 = 1, w30 is for intercept term, and ν3 represents the com-
bination function relating the hidden layer to the output layer.
</p>
<p>An interpretation of the above algebra is that we have two neurons; each
has a probability hj of firing off. Whether a given neuron fires off depends
on the inputs or stimuli (x&rsquo;s) and how influential they are (w&rsquo;s). If enough
neurons fire off, we get a response, i.e., the output, the dependent vari-
able changes. This occurs through the function ϕ, which in turn depends
</p>
<p>4 However, the theorem does not say that the multilayer perceptron with a single hidden
layer is the best. Interestingly, more hidden layers is often easier to implement and
reduces learning time.</p>

</p>
<p>on whether the hidden layer neurons fire off (h&rsquo;s) and if they do, how influ-
ential they are in determining the response (represented by the w&rsquo;s).
</p>
<p>18.3.2 Back-Propagation Algorithm
</p>
<p>Training the network involves the process of finding the optimal weights (wji,
where j indexes a node (either a hidden neuron or an output) and i the inputs
that go into that node) to attach to the input values from the preceding layer.
The process of neural net training is similar to the process of estimating
parameters in nonlinear regression. The network searches for the optimal
weights such that the predicted output value from the output layer is as
close to the corresponding actual output value as possible.
</p>
<p>The most well-known method of finding optimal weights for the multilayer
perceptron is the back-propagation algorithm, which consists of two passes.
We start with the calibration sample, also called the &ldquo;training set.&rdquo; In the
forward pass, for each observation in the training set, the values of the input
variables in the input layer pass forward through the network, through the
hidden layers, and produce predicted output values at the end. All the weights
are fixed during the forward pass. That is, at each iteration, the predicted
output values are calculated given the input values and the synaptic weights
determined by the previous iteration. In the backward pass, the errors be-
tween the predicted output value and the corresponding actual output value
are calculated. The errors are flowed backward through the network and the
weights are adjusted to have smaller errors in the next iteration.
</p>
<p>We more formally describe the back-propagation algorithm applied to the
multilayer perceptron in Fig. 18.3. The error signal at the output for the nth
training observation at iteration t, en(t)(n = 1, . . . , N) is defined by en(t) =
dn(t)&minus; yn where yn is the derived output value from the neural network for
the nth training observation and dn(t) is the corresponding actual output
(or response) value. We now define the total error at iteration t as
</p>
<p>E(t) =
1
2
</p>
<p>&sum;N
n=1
</p>
<p>en(t)2 =
1
2
</p>
<p>&sum;N
n=1
</p>
<p>[dn(t)&minus; yn]2 (18.7)
</p>
<p>where N is the total number of training example. The scaling factor 1/2 in
Equation 18.7 is included to simplify matters in subsequent analysis (Haykin
1999). That is, differentiating Equation 18.7 with respect to w, we have
&part;E(t)/&part;w =
</p>
<p>&sum;
en(t)[&part;en(t)/&part;w]. Note also that the total error E is a func-
</p>
<p>tion of all the free parameters (i.e., synaptic weights) of the network. For a
given training set, E represents the cost function as a measure of learning
performance. The objective of the learning process is to adjust the free pa-
rameters of the network to minimize E. That is, the synaptic weights are
adjusted to make the actual response of the network move closer to the de-
sired response in terms of squared error.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.3 Multilayer Perceptrons 455
</p>
<p>Rumelhart et al. (1986) have employed the generalized delta rule in ad-
justing weights that is similar to methods of nonlinear optimization employed
in statistics. Hence, the goal of the algorithm is to find the optimal weights
minimizing the total error E for a given training set. The optimal weights
are found in an iterative way since the objective function is highly nonlinear.
The generalized delta rule states the following adjustments for the synaptic
weights at correction. The correction ∆wji(t) to the weight wji(t) at iteration
t is given by
</p>
<p>∆wji(t) = α∆wji(t&minus; 1)&minus; η &part;E(t)
&part;wji(t)
</p>
<p>(18.8)
</p>
<p>where α represents the momentum parameter, η is the learning-rate para-
meter, and &part;E(t)/&part;wji(t) is the partial derivative of the total error (Equa-
tion 18.7) with respect to the weight wji(t). The generalized delta rule be-
comes the delta rule when the momentum parameter α is set to zero.
</p>
<p>In Equation 18.8, the partial derivative &part;E(t)/&part;wji(t) = &minus;
&sum;N
</p>
<p>n=1 en(t)
[&part;yn/ &part;wji(t)] represents a sensitivity factor that determines the direction of
search in weight space for the synaptic weight wji(t). The minus sign (before
η) ensures that the newly calculated weight will be in the opposite direction
from which the partial derivative increases. That is, if the partial derivative is
positive, that means that increasing the weight increases error. Hence we will
want to change the weight in the negative direction, and the negative sign en-
sures this. The learning-rate parameter η controls the magnitude of the weight
changes from iteration t to iteration t + 1. A small value of η will lead to a
large number of iterations, while too large a value of η will result in a network
missing actual minima. The role of the momentum parameter α is to increase
the rate of learning but avoid the possible problem of instability (Haykin
1999). Often restricted to [0, 1) in practice, the momentum parameter mea-
sures how much the previous weight change influences the current weight
change. Hence, a large value for α means the algorithm will tend to maintain
the same direction of change as before, i.e., estimation with high momentum
means the algorithm will respond slowly to training sample that suggest the
reverse of weight change (Berry and Linoff 1997). In other words, assigning a
large value for the momentum parameter will have a stabilizing effect in the
direction in which weights are change, avoiding oscillations in the estimated
parameter.

<p>18.3.3 Application to Credit Scoring
</p>
<p>In this section, we apply a multilayer feed-forward network to the credit scor-
ing model. Kindly provided by Professor Fahrmeir, Institute of Statistics,
University of Munich, Germany, the data set consists of credit behavior for
1,000 customers of a German bank. The data will be randomly divided into
two equally sized groups, 500 customers for the estimation sample and 500</p>

ables. Two variables, SEX (female/male) and MARRIAGE (marital status),

sent previous customer behavior and credit characteristics: BAD (bad ac-
count), GOOD (good account), DURATION (duration of credit in months),

and Shin (1998).
</p>
<p>The multilayer perceptron with a hidden layer is applied. The hidden layer
has two neurons. In result, our multilayer perceptron is an 8-2-1 network. Us-
ing SAS Enterprise Miner, the weights are estimated by the back-propagation
algorithm. The estimation results are summarized in Table 18.1.
</p>
<p>Neuron 1 in the hidden layer receives 8 input values (plus a bias or
an intercept term) from the input layer, and their associated weights are
estimated to be the values in the second column in Table 18.1. Similarly,
neuron 2 in the hidden layer receives the same input values from the in-
put layer, and the corresponding weights are estimated to be the values in
the third column in Table 18.1. Applying the combination and the (logis-
tic) activation function into the input values with the associated weights,
we have the output values of neuron 1 (h1) and 2 (h2). The resulting out-
put values, h1 and h2, become the input values to the output layer. That
is, an output neuron (DEFAULT) in the output layer receives two input
values (plus an intercept term) in the hidden layer, and the corresponding
weights are estimated to be the values in the fourth column in Table 18.1.
As you can see, it is very difficult to interpret the weights directly. For
example, the w&rsquo;s for few of the variables have opposite signs in the two
neurons.</p>

<p>18.3.4 Optimal Number of Units in the Hidden Layer,
Learning-Rate, and Momentum Parameters
</p>
<p>ANNs are often criticized for their subjectivity in specifying network archi-
tecture and training parameters (Tam and Kiang 1992). Model selection has
been the one of the most difficult problems in statistics. Similarly, selecting
the best network architecture in ANN is not a trivial problem. The universal
approximation theorem suggests that the multilayer perceptron with one hid-
den layer will perform satisfactorily. Still we need to determine the number
of neurons in the hidden layer. Large numbers of hidden layers will be able to
capture the sophisticated relationship between input and outputs. However,
too many hidden layers will essentially memorize the training observations,
leading to overfitting.
</p>
<p>There are heuristic methods for determining the number of neurons in the
hidden layer. In order to avoid over-fitting, they should not be more than
twice the number of input variables in the input layer (Berry and Linoff
1997). Others use the square root of the number of input variables in the
input layer as the number of neurons in the hidden layer (Kim et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>The better way of finding the optimal number of units in the hidden layer
is to find it empirically. We partition the data into the estimation and the
validation samples. Then we train networks with different number of neurons
in the hidden layer using the estimation sample and evaluate the trained
networks in the validation sample. The network with the smallest SSE (or
the highest hit-rate for the classification task, see Chapter 11) is chosen as
the best network architecture that has the optimal number of units in the
hidden layer.
</p>
<p>We can also conduct a grid search to determine the optimal number
of neurons in the hidden layer simultaneously with the optimal learning-
rate and momentum parameters. For example, we may try out η &isin;
{0.1, 0.4, 0.7, 0.9}, α &isin; {0.0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.9} and the number of neurons in the
hidden layer &isin; {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Then you need to train 80(= 4&times; 4&times; 5) different
networks and compare their prediction performances.
</p>
<p>18.3.5 Stopping Criteria
</p>
<p>Similar to all nonlinear optimization problems, there are no clean-cut criteria
for stopping the weight adjustments in the back-propagation algorithm. How-
ever, there are a couple of reasonable criteria. First, the objective function of
the multilayer perceptron, Equation 18.7, will have a local or global minimum
when the first-order partial derivatives &part;E/&part;wji equal to zero for all i and
j. Therefore, we can formulate a stopping rule with respect to the gradient
vector of weights (Haykin 1999). We stop the iteration when the Euclidean
norm of the gradient vector reaches a small gradient threshold specified by
the user.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>458 18 Artificial Neural Networks
</p>
<p>The limitations of the gradient method for the stopping rule are the length
of running time with the requirement of computing the gradient vector. Al-
ternatively, we can propose a stopping rule based on the rate of change in
the objective function itself because it is stationary at the minimum (Haykin
1999). We stop the training iteration when the absolute rate of change in the
objective function is sufficiently small.
</p>
<p>Both these rules require subjectively determined thresholds, and undoubt-
edly the appropriate thresholds depend on the type of data being modeled.
Researchers should try alternative values and settle on &ldquo;default values&rdquo; as
they gain experience with their data.
</p>
<p>18.3.6 Feature (Input Variable) Selection
</p>
<p>Selecting relevant input variables is important in improving the performance
of a neural network. The objective is to find the minimum subset of input
variables that yield the highest accuracy. This problem, often called feature
subset selection, is conceptually similar to the variable selection problem in
a classical regression model (see Chapter 11). Interest in the feature selec-
tion problem is intensifying because the size of customer information file is
increasing.
</p>
<p>There are two types of approaches to finding an optimal feature subset
in a neural network. The &ldquo;filter&rdquo; approach performs feature selection inde-
pendently of the neural net learning algorithm. In contrast, the &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo;
approach finds the optimal subset of features guided by the performance of
the learning algorithm. The filter approach is computationally more efficient
than the wrapper approach. However, many researchers have criticized the
filtering model since it ignores the effect of the selected features on the per-
formance of the neural network (Yang and Honavar 1998; Hsu et al. 2002).
The wrapper model overcomes this problem of the filtering approach, but
can be computationally expensive since each candidate feature subset must
be evaluated in estimating the neural network.
</p>
<p>Several algorithms have been proposed to speed up the computation in
the wrapper approach. For example, Richeldi and Lanzi (1996) partitioned
features into a number of groups (called factors) and employed a genetic
algorithm to explore the feature space originated by the factors and determine
the set of the most informative feature configurations. On the other hand,
Setiono and Liu (1997) proposed a method that added a penalty term to
the error function of the neural network and identified redundant network
connections from those relevant ones by their small weights when the network
training process was completed.
</p>
<p>We briefly describe the wrapper approach proposed by Hsu et al. (2002).
Their feature selection model, called the &ldquo;artificial neural net input gain
measurement approximation&rdquo; (ANNIGMA), performed better than two</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.3 Multilayer Perceptrons 459
</p>
<p>benchmark wrapper models. They successfully applied their model to two
real-world dataset, the one with 192 features and the other with 41 features.
The ANNIGMA wrapper&rsquo;s method of finding an optimal feature subset is
similar to that of a stepwise variable selection in a classical regression. It
starts with a complete set of original features (or input variables) and re-
moves features from candidate subsets during search. They presented three
versions of their algorithm: (1) greedy backward elimination (BE), (2) back-
ward elimination with backtracking (BEB), and (3) backward stepwise elimi-
nation (BSE). BE starts with estimating a neural net model of all features and
obtains ANNIGMA scores of each feature measuring the relevance (or impor-
tance) of a feature to the performance of the neural net model. It repeatedly
eliminates the next worst ANNIGMA ranked feature until the error rate of
the neural net goes up. BEB allows for backtracking. That is, if the error
rate goes up, the previous feature eliminated is restored and the next worst
ranked feature is eliminated. The process is iterated until a performance-
improving elimination is found for each size of feature subsets. Finally, BSE
is designed to speed up feature selection for large databases. It eliminates a
large number of seemingly irrelevant features in early cycles (i.e., employing
BE) and adjusts the feature subset carefully in the subsequent cycles (i.e.,
employing BEB).
</p>
<p>18.3.7 Assessing the Importance of the Input Variables
</p>
<p>As we saw in Sect. 18.3.3, it is virtually impossible to interpret directly from
the estimated w&rsquo;s how important each input variable is in its impact on the
output variable. This is because the inputs influence several hidden neurons,
and the signs can be in opposite directions. Even if the signs are the same, it
is still difficult to compare one input variable to another based on the several
estimated w&rsquo;s. For example, one variable may have a high w linking to one
neuron, but a low value linking to another. Is this variable more important
than one that has relatively moderate w&rsquo;s linking to each neuron?
</p>
<p>There is no easy solution to this problem. A common approach to as-
sessing variable importance is some form of sensitivity analysis (Berry and
Linoff 1997). For example, to assess the importance of input variable X1, one
might fix the other variables at their means and then vary X1 over its rele-
vant range. One could graph the dependent variable or calculate a statistic
to show how much the dependent variable changes. The problem with this
approach is that nonlinearity of the neural net captures many interactions
between the inputs, i.e., the impact of X1 when the other variables are at
their means may be very different than if the variables are at some different
value.
</p>
<p>Another approach is simply to graph the dependent variable as a function
of the input, without doing any calculations from the neural net model. This</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>460 18 Artificial Neural Networks
</p>
<p>can provide insight similar to a correlation, but as with sensitivity analysis,
does not show the rich non-linearity and interactions that the neural net
has derived. It also does not control, in the regression sense, for the other
variables in the model.
</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, we recommend that the user examine at least
some measure of relationship between the inputs and the output, whether it
is calculated via sensitivity analysis or simply by graphing the independents
against the dependent. This at least provides some idea as to the nature of
the relationship that is in the data.
</p>
<p>18.4 Radial-Basis Function Networks
</p>
<p>The discipline of neural networks is broad, covering diverse classes of models.
ANNs can be grouped into models for supervised learning (also called learning
with a teacher) and for unsupervised learning (also called learning without a
teacher). The most popular neural network models for the supervised learning
tasks are the multilayer perceptron and a radial-basis function network while
self-organizing map (SOM) may be the most well known neural net model for
the unsupervised learning tasks. We cover the SOM in the Clustering chapter.
</p>
<p>18.4.1 Background
</p>
<p>In this section, we introduce one more neural net model for supervised learn-
ing called a radial-basis function (RBF) network that is recently attract-
ing more attention (Poggio and Girosi 1990; Park and Sandberg 1991; Abdi
1994). After multilayer perceptrons, an RBF network is the most popular
neural network model for supervised learning. Different from a multilayer
perceptron, a radial-basis function network fundamentally views the design
of a neural network as a curve-fitting approximation problem in multidimen-
sional space. Its goal is to find the best multidimensional curve explaining
the nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs in the training data. A
radial-basis function network can be said to have a more formal mathematical
basis for the formulation of the network. As its name implies, a radial-basis
function network adopts the theory on radial-basis functions in developing
the foundation for the hidden layer. Originally introduced to solve the multi-
variate interpolation problem, radial-basis functions have become one of the
main fields of study in numerical analysis (Light 1992).
</p>
<p>A radial-basis function network has a similar architectural design as a
multilayer perceptron. It consists of an input layer, a hidden layer and an
output layer (see Fig. 18.3). The functions of the input layer are no different
from those in a multilayer perceptron. However, two networks differ from</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>18.4 Radial-Basis Function Networks 461
</p>
<p>each other in several important aspects (Haykin 1999). First, the activation
function of each hidden unit in a radial-basis function network computes
the Euclidean distance between the input vector and the center of that
unit. In contrast, the activation function of each hidden unit in a multilayer
perceptron computes the inner product of the input vector and the synaptic
weight vector of that unit. Second, a radial-basis function network is allowed
to have only one hidden layer while a multilayer perceptron can have one
or more hidden layers. Finally, the hidden layer of a radial-basis function
network is nonlinear while the output layer is only allowed to take the linear
activation function. As explained later, the role of the hidden layer is quite
different from the output layer in a radial-basis function network. However,
the roles of the hidden and output layer in a multilayer perceptron are
similar, and they are usually nonlinear.
</p>
<p>Because of these differences, a radial-basis function network has the ad-
vantage of avoiding finding a set of parameters that only represents a local
minimum. Applications of a multilayer perceptron often end up in a local min-
imum and their speed of convergence is sometimes problematic. In a radial-
basis function network, the only parameters that are adjusted in the learning
process are the linear mapping from the hidden layer to the output layer.
Because of the linear activation function, the error surface of the radial-basis
function network is quadratic, and hence has a single minimum.
</p>
<p>18.4.2 A Curve-Fitting (Approximation) Problem
</p>
<p>To fix ideas of radial-basis function network, let us consider a nonlinear re-
gression problem where the value of the dependent variable for observation
i (i = 1, . . . , N) is di and the corresponding vector of the independent vari-
ables is xi. Then the general nonlinear relationship between the dependent
variable and the vector of independent variables can be written as
</p>
<p>di = f(xi) + εi (18.9)
</p>
<p>where εi is the random error and f(xi) is a smooth curve.
A radial-basis function network approximates the high-dimensional curve
</p>
<p>f(xi) in the Equation 18.9 by F (x).
</p>
<p>F (x) =
m&sum;
j=1
</p>
<p>wjϕj(x) (18.10)
</p>
<p>where m is the number of neurons in the hidden layer and wj represents the
weight from the jth neuron of the hidden layer to the output. The number
of neurons in the hidden layer or the number of basis function ϕ is generally
less than the number of data points, m &lt; N .</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>462 18 Artificial Neural Networks
</p>
<p>The mathematical justification of a nonlinear transformation followed by
a linear transformation in the Equation 18.10 can be found in a number of
studies (Cover 1965; Poggio and Girosi 1990). In general, a set of basis func-
tions {ϕj(x), i = 1, . . . ,m} is assumed to be linearly independent, and each
ϕj(x) takes the form of a radial-basis function. That is,
</p>
<p>ϕj(x) = ϕ(‖x&minus; tj‖) (18.11)
where ‖&middot;‖ denotes an Euclidean norm and tj is the center of the radial-basis
function for neuron j. One of the most popular choices for the ϕ function is
the Gaussian function.
</p>
<p>ϕj(x) = exp
</p>
<p>[
1
</p>
<p>2σ2j
‖x&minus; tj‖2
</p>
<p>]
(18.12)
</p>
<p>where σ2j is the variance of the Gaussian distribution. The condition σ
2
j = σ
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>for all j is often imposed for mathematical simplification. Different learning
strategies can be adopted depending on how the centers of the radial-basis
functions (tj) are specified (Haykin 1999). The simplest approach is to choose
the (fixed) locations of the centers randomly from the training dataset. A
more sophisticated method is to utilize the k-means clustering algorithm
which places the centers of the radial-basis functions in only those regions of
the input space where significant data are present. Alternatively, the centers
of the radial-basis functions (along with other parameters) can be treated as
parameters to be estimated.
</p>
<p>The role of the activation function of each hidden unit in a radial-basis
function network (ϕj(x)) is somewhat different from its role in a multi-
layer perceptron. The activation function in a radial-basis function net-
work computes the distance from the input to each of the centers. Each
cell of the hidden layer represents a center. On the other hand, the activa-
tion function of each hidden unit in a multilayer perceptron computes the
inner product of the input vector and the synaptic weight vector of that
unit.
</p>
<p>Given the above specification, the estimation problem of the radial-basis
function network is to determine a set of weights {wj |j = 1, . . . ,m} to mini-
mize the following error function (Haykin 1999).
</p>
<p>E =
N&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>(di &minus; F (xi))2 + λ‖DF (x)‖2 (18.13)
</p>
<p>where D is a stabilizer and λ is the regularization parameter.
As seen in Equation 18.13, the error objective function for a radial-basis
</p>
<p>function network is different from that for a multilayer perceptron (e.g., back-
propagation). The theory behind the derivation of Equation 18.13 is regular-
ization theory by Tikhonov (1963). In order to solve an ill-posed hyper-surface
reconstruction problem, he proposed to stabilize (or smooth) the solution by</p>

<p>means of an auxiliary nonnegative functional that embeds prior information
about the solution. That is, Equation 18.13, which is called the Tikhonov

ing term. The standard error term or

<p>&sum;
(di &minus; F (xi))2 measures the error (or
</p>
<p>distance) between the actual response di and the estimated response F (xi).
The regularizing term or λ||DF (x)||2 represents a model complexity-penalty
function. The regularization parameter λ controls the balance between the
importance of the training examples and the prior smoothness constraint. If λ
is close to zero, the solution is mostly determined from training examples (i.e.,
less smoothing). As λ gets larger, training examples are more or less treated
as unreliable. In addition, the stabilizer D represents prior information about
the form of the solution.
</p>
<p>18.4.3 Application Example
</p>
<p>We apply a radial-basis function network to the same credit scoring data used
in the example for the multilayer perceptron. We assume a hidden layer with
two neurons and a Gaussian radial-basis function given by Equation 18.12.
We also assume that σ2j = σ
</p>
<p>2. Using SAS Enterprise Miner, the center of
the radial-basis function (tj) is determined and the results are summarized
in Table 18.2.
</p>
<p>The numbers in the second column of Table 18.2 are the centers of
the Gaussian radial-basis function for the first hidden neuron. Similarly,
the numbers in the third column are the centers of the Gaussian radial-
basis function for the second hidden neuron. Similar to the results from
multilayer perceptron, the training or estimation results are difficult to
interpret.
</p>
<p>We also applied the radial-basis function networks (along with multilayer
perceptron and a logit model) to the validation sample of 500 customers.
The hit ratio of the RBF networks is 79.2% (396/500) whereas the hit ratios
of multilayer perceptron and a logit model are 79.6% (398/500) and 76.4%
(= 382/500) respectively. We conclude that neural network models show</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>464 18 Artificial Neural Networks
</p>
<p>slightly better prediction performances than a logit model. But there is
no difference between the RBF networks and multilayer perceptron. There
have been few researches that directly compared the RBF networks with
multilayer perceptron. For example, Park et al. (2002) found that the RBF
network is simpler to implement than multilayer perceptron, needs less
computational memory, converges faster, provide slightly better predictions
and global minimum convergence is achieved.</p>

<p>Machine Learning
</p>
<p>Abstract Traditionally there have been two paradigms of statistical analysis
&ndash; classical and Bayesian. Machine learning is essentially a third paradigm,
based on algorithms that rely heavily on the speed of modern computing to
derive &ldquo;decision rules&rdquo; that predict customer behavior. We discuss several
machine learning techniques, including covering algorithms, instance-based
learning, genetic algorithms, Bayesian networks, support vector machines,
and committee machine methods such as bagging and boosting.
</p>
<p>19.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Machine learning encompasses a repertoire of data mining techniques that
have mainly been developed in the field of computer science. Hence, its goal is
no different from other data mining techniques: discover interesting patterns
or information from data.
</p>
<p>Historically, machine learning researchers have focused more on compre-
hensible patterns than on prediction per se. They have emphasized on un-
derstanding the structure of the data even though their techniques can be
used for prediction and classification. They focused on explicitly representing
knowledge so that decision makers know why the models work. In addition,
researchers in machine learning have been more interested in the exploratory
aspect of data analysis. Statistics has been more concerned with testing hy-
potheses whereas machine learning has been more concerned with formulating
interesting hypotheses (Witten and Frank 2000). However, many techniques
in machine learning have been significantly influenced by statistical concepts.
Sometimes it is difficult to say whether a specific method is a machine learn-
ing technique or a statistical method.
</p>
<p>Researchers in machine learning have developed a number of data analysis
tools &ndash; they prefer the term &ldquo;generalizations&rdquo; &ndash; that can be used in pre-
diction, classification, clustering, and uncovering associations. This chapter
will focus on machine learning tools that are not covered in other chapters.
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>466 19 Machine Learning
</p>
<p>For example, constructing decision trees is one of the most important tools
in machine learning, but it is extensively discussed in Chapter 17. Similarly,
market basket analysis, a machine learning tool that discovers association
rules, is covered in Chapter 13.
</p>
<p>We first discuss three approaches to machine learning that may be
unfamiliar to database marketing researchers: the 1-rule, rule-induction by
covering algorithms, and instance-based learning. The 1-rule is a simple rule-
induction algorithm that is often used as a baseline model for other machine
learning algorithms. The 1-rule also provides insight for understanding other
rule-induction algorithms. In the next section, we study two well-known
covering algorithms for rule induction, PRISM and INDUCT. The PRISM
algorithm constructs a set of &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; rules, assuming no &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in the data.
The INDUCT algorithm overcomes this problem by introducing a probabilis-
tic concept. In instance-based learning we describe the nearest-neighbor and
k-nearest-neighbor methods, along with their extensions. We then discuss
more recent machine learning techniques including genetic algorithms,
Bayesian networks, support vector machines, and committee machines.
</p>
<p>19.2 1-Rule
</p>
<p>The 1-rule or 1R may be the simplest algorithm to generate a set of classifi-
cation rules from training examples.1 It is easy to understand and cheap to
implement. The algorithm is conceptually similar to univariate profiling fre-
quently used by database marketers. Each attribute (or independent variable)
is considered one at a time, and a corresponding set of rules (i.e., relationships
between the selected attribute and the dependent variable) is generated. The
attribute with the smallest classification error is chosen and the correspond-
ing set of rules becomes the final set of rules for the 1R.
</p>
<p>First introduced by Holte (1993), the 1-rule is often used as the baseline
model to compare with a more sophisticated model. Because of its simplicity,
the 1-rule has a critical problem in that the joint effect of multiple attributes
on the response cannot be modeled because each attribute is considered one
at a time. However, its classification performance in validation samples has
been comparable to highly complex machine learning algorithms in various
applications (Holte 1993).
</p>
<p>To see how the 1-rule algorithm works, consider the promotional response
data in Table 19.1. It is a typical classification task in which we would like
to find target customers for a promotional offer. The data consist of a de-
pendent variable indicating the response status to the promotional offer and
</p>
<p>1 Researchers in machine learning prefer the terms training example/instance (or training
sample) to estimation sample in traditional statistics. Estimation samples are used to
determine the values of parameters in statistical models. Similarly, we derive a set of
rules (or patterns) from training instances or examples.</p>

<p>three independent variables characterizing each respondent. For expositional
purposes, all three independent variables are categorical in nature. We will
extend the algorithm to numerical independent variables later.
</p>
<p>We take each attribute in turn and develop a set of rules. For example,
there are ten observations for males and ten for females. Among ten males,
four respond and six do not. Hence for males, the most accurate rule we could
generate would be, &lsquo;if male then do not respond&rsquo; or &lsquo;male &rarr; no&rsquo; in short.
This rule accurately forecasts six out of ten cases and leads to the error rate
of 40%. Similarly, we make a rule for female, &lsquo;female &rarr; no&rsquo; that will lead to
the same error rate. Therefore, if we apply the rules made by the attribute
sex, we would erroneously forecast 8 out of 20 observations.
</p>
<p>Applying the same procedure into the other two attributes, we summarize
the result in Table 19.2. The number of errors for each rule is given, along
with the total number of errors for the set of rules for each attribute. We

<p/>

</p>
<p>now select the attribute that generates the set of rules with the smallest
percentage of errors. In this case, that attribute is contact channel, and the
set of rules is: If contact channel is through e-mail or DM, then the customer
responds. If it is through TM, then she does not respond.
</p>
<p>The 1-rule algorithm treats numeric attributes as continuous and uses a
straightforward method to divide the range of values into several disjoint
intervals. The method is similar to the partitioning technique employed in
decision trees (see Chapter 17). Suppose that ages in Table 19.1 are provided
in numeric values instead of three categories. We rearrange observations in
ascending order according to age.
</p>
<p>16 17 17 18 18 19 19 21 23 24 24 25 27 29 32 34 38 40 41 44
Y Y Y Y Y N N Y N N N N Y Y Y N N N N Y
</p>
<p>To partition the sequence wherever the response class changes, we need 6
breakpoints. That is, with 6 breakpoints of 18.5, 20, 22, 26, 33 and 42.5,
we have a zero error rate on the training example. The corresponding rule
is &lsquo;age &lt; 18.5 &rarr; Yes,&rsquo; &lsquo;18.5 &le; age &lt; 20 &rarr; No,&rsquo; &lsquo;20 &le; age &lt; 22 &rarr; Yes,&rsquo;
&lsquo;22 &le; age &lt; 26 &rarr; No,&rsquo; &lsquo;26 &le; age &lt; 33 &rarr; Yes,&rsquo; &lsquo;33 &le; age &lt; 42.5 &rarr; No,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;42.5 &le; age &rarr; Yes.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>There is a risk of over-fitting in generating rules for continuously valued
attributes. As we can see in the age example, the 1R method will naturally
create a large number of breakpoints and many of them may simply be due to
chance. To avoid this problem, the 1R method requires each partition (except
the rightmost) to contain a minimum number of examples for the majority
response. Suppose that the minimum is set to be three. Then the second, the
third, and the fourth partition in the above age example should be merged,
and the result would be:
</p>
<p>Age 16 17 17 18 18 19 19 21 23 24 24 25 27 29 32 34 38 40 41 44
Actual Y Y Y Y Y N N Y N N N N Y Y Y N N N N Y
Prediction Y Y Y Y Y N N N N N N N Y Y Y N N N N Y
</p>
<p>The corresponding set of rules is &lsquo;age &lt; 18.5 &rarr; Yes,&rsquo; &lsquo;18.5 &le; age &lt; 26 &rarr; No,&rsquo;
&lsquo;26 &le; age &lt; 33 &rarr; Yes,&rsquo; &lsquo;33 &le; age &lt; 42.5 &rarr; No,&rsquo; and &lsquo;age &le; 42.5 &rarr; Yes.&rsquo;
The error rate on the training sample would be 1 out of 20.

<p>19.3 Rule Induction by Covering Algorithms
</p>
<p>Rules are one of the most popular ways of representing knowledge that
machine learning techniques use. There are hundreds of heuristics avail-
able to construct rules from a set of training examples. This section stud-
ies a class of rule-generating algorithms called covering algorithms that have
been proven to be effective in a number of applications (Witten and Frank
2000)</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>19.3.1 Covering Algorithms and Decision Trees
</p>
<p>Trees and rules have some common features in representing knowledge. A
set of rules directly can be constructed from a decision tree (even though the
reverse is not always true). However, an important distinction is that decision
trees are typically constructed using the principle of &ldquo;divide and conquer.&rdquo;
The decision tree algorithm works top-down, recursively. At each stage the
algorithm selects the best attribute to separate examples into the known
classes. The classification is refined as the process of branching is repeated.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the covering algorithm considers each class one at a
time and attempts to construct a set of rules covering all examples (instances)
of each class. That is, we select the rule such that it includes as many instances
of a given class as possible and at the same time excludes as many instances of
the other classes as possible (Witten and Frank 2000). The covering algorithm
refines the selected rule by further restricting the number of instances. The
process is repeated until the pre-specified condition for classification accuracy
is met.
</p>
<p>Figure 19.1 illustrates how the covering algorithm works. There are 26
training instances. Characterized in two attributes or dimensions, each in-
stance is classified into one of three groups: A, B and C. First, let us con-
struct a rule for class A. The horizontal line of Y = 1 will divide As from
the other two classes. The rule for the class A should be: &lsquo;If Y &gt; 1 then
class = A.&rsquo; Since all instances in the A class are covered by the rule, we
construct a set of rules for class B. Restricting the attribute space by Y &le; 1</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>470 19 Machine Learning
</p>
<p>covers all instances in class B and C excluding all observations in class A.
Adding X &le; 1 to the antecedent Y &le; 1, we can refine the rule to cover all
instances in class B without including instances in class C. Hence, the rule
for the class B should be: &lsquo;If X &le; 1 and Y &le; 1 then class = B.&rsquo; Similarly,
the rule for the class C is &lsquo;If X &gt; 1 and Y &le; 1 then class = C.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>We could have applied a decision tree algorithm to the same example in
Fig. 19.1. The tree will have the first split at Y = 1 and the second split at
X = 1. Its result is similar to the covering algorithm. However, decision trees
consider all classes in constructing trees while covering algorithms focus on
one class (of response) at a time. Because of this difference in constructing
rules, there are situations when the covering algorithm is much more effective
in representing knowledge than decision trees.
</p>
<p>Witten and Frank (2000) provide such case in which there are four
attributes, w, x, y, and z and each attribute can take the value of 1, 2, or 3.
Suppose that responses are &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; if x = 1 and y = 1 (whatever the value of
w and z), or if w = 1 and z = 1 (whatever the value of x and y). Otherwise,
responses are &lsquo;No.&rsquo; Rules derived from the covering algorithm are simple: &lsquo;If
x = 1 and y = 1 then response = Yes,&rsquo; &lsquo;if w = 1 and z = 1 then response =
Yes,&rsquo; and otherwise response = No. On the other hand, Fig. 19.2 shows the
derived decision tree applied to the same training examples.2 The solution
provided by the decision trees is much more complicated than the rules by
the covering algorithm. This is called the replicated sub-tree problem. The
reason why rules from the covering algorithm are simple is that each rule
(e.g., if x = 1 and y = 1 then response = Yes) represents an independent
piece of knowledge. Hence, a new rule (e.g., if w = 1 and z = 1 then response
= Yes) can be added to an existing rule without disturbing the previous set
of rules. However, the whole tree needs to be reshaped if we want to add a
new rule to an existing tree structure.
</p>
<p>19.3.2 PRISM
</p>
<p>A simple covering algorithm called PRISM has been proposed by Cendrowska
(1987).3 It is simple to implement and easy to understand. However, the
method is known to overfit the training samples because it assumes no noise
in the data.
</p>
<p>To see how the PRISM algorithm works, we again consider the promo-
tional response data in Table 19.1 introduced in the previous section. The
promotional response consists of two classes: &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No&rsquo;. Applied to each
class in turn, PRISM generates a set of rules for each of the two classes.
</p>
<p>2 Note that some sub-trees in the upper right of Fig. 19.2 are not drawn for simplification.
3 Note: The PRISM algorithm is not to be confused with the PRISM market segmentation
scheme derived from cluster analysis and discussed in Chapter 16.</p>

<p>19.3 Rule Induction by Covering Algorithms 471
</p>
<p>Fig. 19.2 The replicated sub-tree problem of decision trees (Modified from Witten and
Frank 2000).
</p>
<p>Let us first find a set of rules to identify the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; class. That is, we are
seeking a rule taking the form like &lsquo;if X then response = Yes&rsquo; where X is
the characteristic of an attribute. For example, consider a rule &lsquo;if sex = male
then response = Yes.&rsquo; There are ten males among the training examples,
and four out of the ten respond &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Hence, this rule can be said to have
a classification accuracy of 40%. We generate potential rules considering all
possible Xs in Table 19.1 and evaluate their classification accuracy.
</p>
<p>If sex = male then response = Yes 4/10
If sex = female then response = Yes 6/10
If age = teen then response = Yes 5/7
If age = 20s then response = Yes 3/7
If age = 30 plus then response = Yes 2/6
If contact channel = e-mail then response = Yes 5/7
If contact channel = DM then response = Yes 4/7
If contact channel = TM then response = Yes 1/6</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>472 19 Machine Learning
</p>
<p>Among the above lists, the most accurate rules are when X is &lsquo;age = teen&rsquo; or
&lsquo;contact channel = e-mail.&rsquo; Because they are tied with the accuracy of 5/7,
we arbitrarily choose &lsquo;age = teen&rsquo; and create a temporary rule:
</p>
<p>&lsquo;If age = teen then response = Yes&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Because this rule is not perfect (i.e., its predictive accuracy is less than 100%),
we refine it by adding more terms in the antecedent. That is, we are now
seeking a rule of the form &lsquo;if age = teen and Y then response = Yes&rsquo; where Y
is the characteristic of an attribute. Note that we restrict our search space into
the observations with age = teen. There are seven respondents. We generate
the refined rules considering all possible Y s and evaluate the corresponding
classification accuracy.
If age = teen and sex = male then response = Yes 2/3
If age = teen and sex = female then response = Yes 3/4
If age = teen and contact channel = e-mail then response = Yes 2/2
If age = teen and contact channel = DM then response = Yes 3/3
If age = teen and contact channel = TM then response = Yes 0/2
</p>
<p>The third and the fourth rules above both have perfect predictive accuracy.
To select one of them, we apply the coverage heuristic where the rule with
the greater coverage should be selected. We select the fourth since the third
rule only covers two instances and the fourth covers three. We now have the
final rule:
</p>
<p>&lsquo;If age = teen and contact channel = DM then response = Yes&rsquo;
</p>
<p>This is just one rule covering only three &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; instances in the data. There are
still seven other &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; instances to be covered. Continuing the PRISM algo-
rithm, we delete the three instances that are already covered. The resulting
data are shown in Table 19.3, consisting of 17 observations.
</p>
<p>The same process is applied to the reduced data shown in Table 19.3. That
is, consider a rule taking the form of &lsquo;if X then response = Yes.&rsquo; Enumer-
ating potential rules for all possible Xs with the corresponding classification
accuracy:
If sex = male then response = Yes 3/9
If sex = female then response = Yes 4/8
If age = teen then response = Yes 2/4
If age = 20s then response = Yes 3/7
If age = 30 plus then response = Yes 2/6
If contact channel = e-mail then response = Yes 5/7
If contact channel = DM then response = Yes 1/4
If contact channel = TM then response = Yes 1/6
</p>
<p>The most accurate rule is the sixth when X is &lsquo;contact channel = e-mail.&rsquo;
Hence, we create a temporary rule:
</p>
<p>&lsquo;If contact channel = e-mail then response = Yes&rsquo;</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Again we refine this rule because it is not perfect. We consider a rule taking
the form of &lsquo;if contact channel = e-mail and Y then response = Yes&rsquo; where
Y is the characteristic of an attribute. Enumerating potential rules for all
possible Y s with the corresponding classification accuracy:
If contact channel = e-mail and sex = male then response = Yes 2/4
If contact channel = e-mail and sex = female then response = Yes 3/3
If contact channel = e-mail and age = teen then response = Yes 2/2
If contact channel = e-mail and age = 20s then response = Yes 2/3
If contact channel = e-mail and age = 30 plus then response = Yes 1/2
We find two perfect rules: the second and the third. Applying the principle
of the greatest coverage, we select the second covering three instances and
write another final rule:
</p>
<p>&lsquo;If contact channel = e-mail and sex = female then response = Yes&rsquo;
</p>
<p>We now cover 6 &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; instances out of 10 in the data. By the same process,
we continue applying the PRISM algorithm in an effort to cover all 10 &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;
instances. Summarizing all the final rules to identify the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; class:
&lsquo;If age = teen and contact channel = DM then response = Yes&rsquo;
&lsquo;If contact channel = e-mail and sex = female then response = Yes&rsquo;
&lsquo;If contact channel = e-mail and age = teen then response = Yes&rsquo;
&lsquo;If age = 20s and sex = female and contact channel = DM then response =
Yes&rsquo;
</p>
<p>&lsquo;If sex = male and age = 30 plus and contact channel = TM then
response = Yes&rsquo;
</p>
<p>As shown above, the first two rules cover three &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; instances each. The
remaining three rules cover one &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; instance each. That is, the above five</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>474 19 Machine Learning
</p>
<p>rules cover 9 out of 10 &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; instances &ndash; we could not cover all 10 &lsquo;Yeses&rsquo;.
It is interesting to look at the instance that could not be covered by the
PRISM algorithm. It is the fourth observation in Table 19.1. The trouble
is that the seventh observation has the identical attributes with different re-
sponse. We cannot cover both these observations using the three attributes in
Table 19.1.
</p>
<p>Once all the final rules are generated for the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; class, the PRISM algo-
rithm is applied to the &lsquo;No&rsquo; class. The same process is applied and a set of
the final rules is constructed for the &lsquo;No&rsquo; class.
</p>
<p>19.3.3 A Probability Measure for Rule Evaluation
and the INDUCT Algorithm
</p>
<p>The accuracy ratio is the critical metric to construct a set of perfect rules
in the PRISM rule-generating algorithm. It is defined as the ratio c/n where
n is the total number of instances covered by a rule and c is the number of
instances classified (or predicted) correctly by the rule. For example, the first
rule of the five final rules for class Yes in the previous section, &lsquo;If age = teen
and contact channel = DM then response = Yes,&rsquo; covers three instances in
Table 19.1 and correctly classifies all three. So the accuracy ratio of this rule
is perfect.
</p>
<p>However, the PRISM algorithm tends to overfit the training instances be-
cause it uses the accuracy ratio as a metric to select the best rules. A method
of overcoming this problem is proposed by Gaines and Compton (1995)
who introduced the concept of the quality of a rule. Their algorithm, called
INDUCT, exploits the idea of statistical significance based on the binomial
distribution.
</p>
<p>The quality of a proposed rule can be evaluated by calculating the prob-
ability of the baseline rule providing equal or better classification accuracy
to the proposed rule. Let N be the total number of instances covered by
the baseline rule and C be the number of instances correctly classified by
this rule. The baseline rule for the given class typically is the rule that can
be made without knowing any attribute information. For the promotional
response data in Table 19.1, the baseline rule of the response class &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;No&rsquo;) is to say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; (or &lsquo;No&rsquo;) whatever the characteristics of an instance
are. This baseline rule covers 20 instances (N = 20) of which 10 instances
(C = 10) are correctly classified. Hence, the accuracy ratio of a proposed rule
should be at least greater than 0.5(= 10/20) if it has any value.
</p>
<p>Given the baseline rule with N and C, assume the proposed rule covers
n instances with c correct classifications. For example, one of the best rules
for Yes class, &lsquo;If age = 20s and sex = female and contact channel = DM
then recommend = Yes&rsquo; is a perfect rule with n = c = 1. Then what is
the probability that the baseline rule would correctly classify c instances</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.3 Rule Induction by Covering Algorithms 475
</p>
<p>when it is applied to n instances? This probability is known to follow a
hypergeometric distribution. The problem is analogous to the well-known
experiment of sampling without replacement in probability theory. That is,
an urn contains N balls among which C balls are marked &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and the rest
N &minus; C balls are marked &lsquo;No.&rsquo; The experiment is to randomly draw n balls
from the urn without replacement. The probability that the sample of n balls
contains exactly c balls marked &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and the rest marked &lsquo;No&rsquo; is given as a
hypergeometric distribution.
</p>
<p>P (c|N,C, n) =
</p>
<p>(
C
c
</p>
<p>)(
N &minus; C
n&minus; c
</p>
<p>)
(
N
n
</p>
<p>) (19.1)
</p>
<p>We measure the quality of a proposed rule by the probability of the baseline
rule providing equal or better classification accuracy to the proposed rule.
Hence, going back to the urn example, it is the probability that the sample
of n balls contains more than or equal to c balls marked &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; The quality
of a proposed rule q(R) is given by
</p>
<p>q(R) =
n&sum;
</p>
<p>i=c
</p>
<p>P (i|N,C, n) (19.2)
</p>
<p>where P (i|N,C, n) is the density of a hypergeometric distribution in Equa-
tion 19.1. Higher values of q(R) mean that the proposed rule is not much
better than the baseline rule, since the baseline rule has a high probability of
achieving at least the same accuracy. For example, let us evaluate the quality
of the proposed rule for class &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;: &lsquo;If age = 20s and sex = female and con-
tact channel = DM then response = Yes&rsquo;. It is a perfect rule with n = c = 1
and the corresponding baseline rule has N = 20 and C = 10. Employing
Equation 19.2, the quality of the proposed rule q(R) is calculated to be 0.5.
That is, a random prediction baseline would have a 50% chance of predicting
at least as well as the proposed rule. Now let us evaluate another perfect rule
in the list. PRISM suggests &lsquo;If contact channel = e-mail and sex = female
then recommend = Yes.&rsquo; It is a first rule in the set of rules for class &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
It is a perfect rule with n = c = 3 and the corresponding baseline rule has
N = 20 and C = 10. Its value of the quality is calculated to be 0.11. Hence,
this proposed rule is better than the previously proposed rule because it is
less likely the baseline rule could have generated the same or better accuracy
as the new proposed rule.
</p>
<p>We are ready to describe the covering algorithm of INDUCT (Gaines
and Compton 1995). First, the PRISM algorithm is applied to construct the
best perfect rules for each class. The perfect rules for class &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;No&rsquo; are:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>476 19 Machine Learning
</p>
<p>&lsquo;If age = teen and contact channel = DM then response = Yes&rsquo;
&lsquo;If contact channel = e-mail and sex = female then response = Yes&rsquo;
&lsquo;If contact channel = e-mail and age = teen then response = Yes&rsquo;
&lsquo;If age = 20s and sex = female and contact channel = DM then response =
Yes&rsquo;
</p>
<p>&lsquo;If sex = male and age = 30 plus and contact channel = TM then
response = Yes&rsquo;
</p>
<p>&lsquo;If contact channel = TM and sex = female then response = No&rsquo;
&lsquo;If contact channel = TM and age = teen then response = No&rsquo;
&lsquo;If age = 30 plus and contact channel = DM then response = No&rsquo;
&lsquo;If sex = male and age = 20s and contact channel = TM then response =
No&rsquo;
</p>
<p>&lsquo;If sex = male and age = 20s and contact channel = DM then response =
No&rsquo;
</p>
<p>&lsquo;If sex = male and age = 30 plus and contact channel = e-mail then
response = No&rsquo;
</p>
<p>Second, we use q(R) to help us decide whether a given rule should be
&ldquo;pruned&rdquo;. Specifically, we compare each of the rules generated from the pre-
vious step with the corresponding rule before a further restriction is added.
For example, consider one of the perfect rules in the above line, &lsquo;if contact
channel = TM and sex = female then response = No.&rsquo; This rule leads to 3
perfect classifications (n = c = 3) and the corresponding baseline rule has
N = 20 and C = 10. The value of the rule (q(R)) is 0.11. In order to see
whether pruning is appropriate, the preceding rule before adding the con-
dition sex = female that is &lsquo;if contact channel = TM then response = No
is considered.&rsquo; This preceding rule is not perfect but n = 6 and c = 5. Its
value is calculated to be 0.07, which is lower than the value of 0.11 calcu-
lated for the perfect rule. That is, cutting off the last term (sex = female)
changes the accuracy ratio from 3/3 to 5/6 and improves the quality of the
rule from 0.11 to 0.07. We continue this pruning process by removing the
last term until the quality measure no longer improves. We apply this prun-
ing process to each of 11 perfect rules above and summarize the results in
Table 19.4.
</p>
<p>Third, we select the rule with the smallest q(R) among the set of pruned
rules. There are 11 pruned rules in Table 19.4 and the rule &lsquo;if contact
channel = TM&rsquo; has the smallest q(R) of 0.07.
</p>
<p>Fourth, we delete the instances covered by the rule with the smallest q(R)
from the training examples and repeat the process of growing and pruning
rules from step 1 to 3 for the remaining instances. We continue this procedure
until no training examples remain.
</p>
<p>The INDUCT covering algorithm elegantly avoids over-fitting by intro-
ducing a probabilistic metric of measuring the quality of a rule. However,
the INDUCT does not guarantee the best rule generation partially because
the evaluation of q(R) is only made over the temporary rules generated by
PRISM (Witten and Frank 2000). The ideal method of finding the best rule</p>

attributes), but this is too computationally burdensome. Recently a number
of researchers have proposed alternative algorithms to search for the best
rules without incurring too much computational time (Cohen 1995; Frank
and Witten 1998).

<p>19.4 Instance-Based Learning
</p>
<p>Representing knowledge in the form of historical examples may be the sim-
plest way of learning. People intentionally or unintentionally memorize a set
of training instances. When a new instance comes up, memorized instances
are searched to find the most similar one to the new instance. For example,
when we first look at a person, we search our memory to find the person
who has the most similar appearance. We judge the new person&rsquo;s personality
based on this person whose personality is already known to us.
</p>
<p>This section discusses a machine learning algorithm called instance-based
learning or memory-based reasoning. Memory-based collaborative filtering</p>

</p>
<p>discussed in Chapter 14 employs an instance-based learning algorithm to pre-
dict the preference of the target user. We here discuss instance-based learning
in a broader context. Its original idea was developed by statisticians who em-
ployed the nearest-neighbor methods for prediction and classification tasks
(Fix and Hodges 1951; Johns 1961). Aha (1992) provided techniques to han-
dle noisy data in instance-based learning algorithms and popularized these
methods among machine learning researchers.
</p>
<p>19.4.1 Strengths and Limitations
</p>
<p>Instance-based learning techniques have successfully been applied to various
classification and prediction problems. Their broad appeal comes from sev-
eral sources. Instance-based learning is simple to implement and its results are
easy to understand. More importantly, it is very flexible in the required format
of the input records (Berry and Linoff 1997). The algorithm only requires ba-
sic arithmetic operations in calculating similarities between instances. Hence,
it can easily be applied to diverse data including images and text.
</p>
<p>However, instance-based learning tends to be resource-intensive both in
computation and storage space. We need to process all the historical in-
stances to find the most similar instance and classify the new instance. Other
data mining techniques such as neural networks spend much time analyzing
the training examples and constructing models. Once a generalized model is
constructed and saved, the classification of new instances is fast and easy.
In contrast, instance-based learning takes a completely opposite approach. It
is fast in the analysis of the training examples because it does not need to
construct models or rules, but simply stores training examples for future use.
Instance-based learning postpones major computations for later. It requires
a great deal of computer memory for saving training examples that will be
fetched when classifying new instances.
</p>
<p>Results of instance-based learning are sensitive to the choice of distance
function and the attribute-weighting scheme, the subset selection of the train-
ing samples, and the presence of outliers. As discussed later, a number of
techniques have been developed to make the algorithm robust even though a
single best algorithm does not exist.
</p>
<p>19.4.2 A Brief Description of an Instance-Based
Learning Algorithm
</p>
<p>Suppose that we have N training instances in which we observe the classifica-
tion membership of each instance with its attribute values. Let the category
identification of instance i be yi and the corresponding vector of attributes</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.4 Instance-Based Learning 479
</p>
<p>be xi = (xi1, . . . , xim) where m represents the number of attributes. Our goal
is to classify a new instance that has attributes z = (z1, . . . , zm).
</p>
<p>The nearest-neighbor method searches over the training instances and finds
the most similar instance to the new instance. There are a number of ways to
measure the similarity or the distance between two instances. Since the issue
of similarity is extensively discussed in the chapter of collaborative filtering,
here we simply use the Euclidean distance. That is, the distance between a
new observation and instance i in the training set is
</p>
<p>d(z,xi) =
&radic;
</p>
<p>(z1 &minus; xi1)2 + &middot; &middot; &middot;+ (zm &minus; xim)2 (19.3)
</p>
<p>All attributes are transformed to have a range from zero to one so that each
attribute is treated identically in distance contribution. Once the distances
are calculated over all training instances, we find the training instance with
the minimum distance. The class of the new instance is predicted to be the
same as the category membership y of this closest training instance.
</p>
<p>The nearest-neighbor method tends to be sensitive to few noisy instances.
In order to reduce the effect of noisy instances on the results, we adopt the
k-nearest-neighbor method where we select the k nearest training instances
and use them together to predict the class of the new instance. One possibil-
ity is to take the majority class from the k nearest training instances as the
predicted class of the new instance. Alternatively, each of the k nearest train-
ing instances can get differential weights in predicting the class of the new
instance (Berry and Linoff 1997). The more similar to the new instance, the
larger weight it is assigned. The inverse of the distance to the new instance
is used for the weight assigned to each of the k nearest training instances.4
</p>
<p>The suitable value of k should be determined empirically. That is, the
k-nearest-neighbors method is applied with different values of k and perfor-
mance in a validation sample is compared. In general, the optimal value of k
increases with the amount of noise.
</p>
<p>19.4.3 Selection of Exemplars
</p>
<p>Instance-based learning easily becomes computationally intensive because all
the training examples must be scanned to predict the class of a new instance.
Hence, we want to limit the number of training examples used for classifica-
tion to be as small as possible. We do not want to store a lot of redundant
training examples. At the same time we do not want to exclude meaning-
ful examples. Witten and Frank (2000) use the term &ldquo;exemplars&rdquo; to refer
to the already-seen instances that are used for classification. We start with
an exemplar randomly chosen from the calibration sample and classify each
</p>
<p>4 In order to avoid the problem of inversing zero distance, it is common to add one before
taking the inverse.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>480 19 Machine Learning
</p>
<p>new instance from the calibration sample with respect to the exemplar. If the
new instance is misclassified, it is added to the exemplar database. Correctly
classified instances (e.g., redundant instances) are discarded. Ideally, each
exemplar in the exemplar database represents an important region of the
instance space. However, this method of only storing misclassified instances
will not work well when the data have a lot of noise. Noisy instances by defi-
nition cannot be explained by the model and should not be incorporated into
the exemplar database. However, noisy instances are very likely to be mis-
classified and so saved into the exemplar database leading to low predictive
accuracy. Our goal is to find interesting patterns (e.g., exemplars) without
recording redundant patterns. We do not want to interpret statistical noise
as meaningful patterns.
</p>
<p>Aha (1992) proposed an instance-based learning algorithm to overcome
the above problem of noisy instances, while minimizing the size of the ex-
emplar database. It applies an accuracy filter that monitors the predictive
performance of each instance and stores only those instances showing high
classification accuracy. That is, it keeps track of the classification perfor-
mance of each training instance (e.g., the ratio of the correctly classified to
the total number of classifications). A test based on confidence intervals for
proportions is employed to decide whether instances are acceptable, noisy or
uncertain. The idea is to determine whether the instance predicts better than
random. Therefore, a confidence interval is computed for both the instance&rsquo;s
(cumulative) classification performance and its class&rsquo;s observed frequency. If
the lower bound of the confidence interval for the instance&rsquo;s classification
performance exceeds above the upper bound of the confidence interval for
its class&rsquo;s observed frequency, the instance is acceptable for classification de-
cision, and hence becomes the member of the exemplar set. In contrast, if
the upper bound of the confidence interval for the instance&rsquo;s classification
performance drops below the lower bound of the confidence interval for its
class&rsquo;s observed frequency, the instance is indefinitely removed from the ex-
emplar set. If the instance&rsquo;s performance is somewhere between acceptable
and unacceptable, it is considered to be a member of the potential set. The
instances in the potential set are not allowed to be used for prediction but
their predictive performances are continually updated and eventually may be
added to the exemplar set or indefinitely removed from the potential set.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose that an exemplar has been used n1 times to classify
instances, and x1 of these predictions have been correct. We can estimate the
confidence interval for the true success rate of this exemplar.5 Now, suppose
the exemplar&rsquo;s class has occurred x2 times out of a total number n2 of training
instances. From this, we can compute the confidence interval for the default
(random) success rate (x2/n2), the probability of successfully classifying an
</p>
<p>5 This would be calculated using the confidence interval for proportions, p&plusmn;zα/2
&radic;
</p>
<p>p(1&minus;p)
n
</p>
<p>,
</p>
<p>where p = x1/n1 and zα/2 is the normal deviate from the standard normal distribution
corresponding to a confidence level of 1 &minus; α.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.5 Genetic Algorithms 481
</p>
<p>instance of this class without relying on the exemplar&rsquo;s information. The
following table illustrates:
</p>
<p>Method Prediction 95% Conf. Int. Comparison
</p>
<p>Using exemplar x1 = 250; n1 = 500 0.500&plusmn; 0.044 Lower Bound = 0.456
Random prediction x2 = 400; n2 = 1, 000 0.400&plusmn; 0.030 Upper Bound = 0.430
</p>
<p>Since the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for predictive accuracy
using the exemplar is higher than the upper bound for predictive accuracy
using random prediction, the exemplar is acceptable and would be added to
the exemplar set.
</p>
<p>Aha (1992) uses a high confidence level (5%) for acceptance and a lower
confidence level (12.5%) for rejection. This makes it statistically easier for
an instance to be dropped than to be accepted, and reduces the number of
exemplars.
</p>
<p>19.4.4 Attribute Weights
</p>
<p>The accuracy of instance-based learning is sensitive to the type of distance
function employed. The Euclidean distance in the Equation 19.3 performs
reasonably well. However, it is intuitively unappealing to assume that all
attributes should contribute equally in defining the distance or similarity
between two instances. Hence, we generalize the Euclidean distance to ac-
commodate unequal weightings,
</p>
<p>d(z,xi) =
&radic;
</p>
<p>w1(z1 &minus; xi1)2 + &middot; &middot; &middot;+ wm(zm &minus; xim)2 (19.4)
</p>
<p>which becomes the Euclidean distance when all the weights are the same.
Aha (1992) suggests an algorithm to update attribute-specific weights dy-
</p>
<p>namically. All weights are updated after we find the most similar exemplar
to a new training instance. Given the new training instance z and the most
similar exemplar xi, |zk&minus;xik| is calculated for each attribute k. This is a mea-
sure of the contribution of attribute k to the classification decision. Attribute
weight wk is updated based on the size of |zk&minus;xik| and whether the classifica-
tion was indeed correct or not. If the new instance is classified correctly, the
weight will be increased. If it is incorrect, the weight will decrease. And the
difference |zk&minus;xik| will determine the magnitude of this increase or decrease.
</p>
<p>19.5 Genetic Algorithms
</p>
<p>A genetic algorithm is a class of robust and efficient search techniques based
on the concept of adaptation in natural organisms. The theory of evolution
and survival of the fittest tells us that species (or individuals) well fitted to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>482 19 Machine Learning
</p>
<p>their environment survive over millions of years and their chromosomes or
genome would be propagated one generation to the next. In a genetic al-
gorithm, an individual (or candidate solution) is selected for reproduction
based on how its fitness (predictive ability) compares to that of other indi-
viduals. Individuals are traditionally represented in binary as strings of 0s and
1s. The evolution begins with randomly generated individuals (solutions). In
each generation, once the fitness of every individual is evaluated, less fit in-
dividuals do not survive and genomes of more fit individuals are propagated.
</p>
<p>Genetic algorithms became popular after John Holland developed its solid
theoretical foundation in the early 1970s (Holland 1975). They have been
successfully applied to complex problems in diverse fields. Within market-
ing, Hurley et al. (1995) outlined 11 areas in which genetic algorithms have
been applied. Gatarski (2002) employed a genetic algorithm to automatically
design banner advertising. The resulting system created innovative banner
designs that performed increasingly better than reference banners, improv-
ing the click-through rate from 0.68% for the standard banner to 3.1% with-
out human intervention from the advertiser. Kim et al. (2005) used artificial
neural networks guided by genetic algorithms to identify and profile cus-
tomers who are most likely interested in a particular product or service. The
genetic algorithm in their model plays a key role in selecting input features
for an artificial neural network.
</p>
<p>A simple example provided by Berry and Linoff (1997) will help us to
understand the basic concepts of genetic algorithms. Suppose we try to find
the integer value of p maximizing f(p) = 31p&minus; p2 where the integer p varies
between 0 and 31. We first represent a solution (e.g., the parameter value p
from 0 to 31) as an array of bits. Five bits are required to represent all solu-
tions (e.g., 0 to 31). For example, p = 1 can be represented by {00001}. The
fitness function, defined over the genetic representation, measures the quality
of the solution. In this example, the fitness function is f(p). Once we have
the genetic representation and defined the fitness function, the genetic algo-
rithm generates an initial set of solutions randomly, and then improves them
through repetitive application of selection, crossover and mutation. Suppose
that we randomly generate the initial set of solutions below. The average
fitness of the initial solutions is 117.75.
</p>
<p>Solution p Fitness
</p>
<p>10110 22 176
00011 3 87
00010 2 58
11001 25 150
</p>
<p>We now improve the fitness of the initial solutions through three &ldquo;operators.&rdquo;
The first operator selects solutions with higher fitness for successive gener-
ations. That is, the chance of a solution surviving to the next generation is
proportional to its fitness value. Specifically, the total fitness value of the
above four solutions is 471. The ratio of the fitness of each solution to the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.5 Genetic Algorithms 483
</p>
<p>total fitness is 0.37, 0.19, 0.12 and 0.32, respectively. We now spin a roulette
wheel four times in which each solution has an area of these four proportions.
Each spin we select a solution (using sampling with replacement) to survive
to the next generation. Below is the resulting set of solutions after selection
through spinning a roulette wheel.
</p>
<p>Solution p Fitness
</p>
<p>10110 22 176
</p>
<p>11001 25 150
</p>
<p>00010 2 58
</p>
<p>10110 22 176
</p>
<p>Notice that the selection procedure results in more copies of the solutions
with high fitness values and fewer for the less fit. One of the low fit solutions
{00011} has not survived, but there are two copies of the solution with the
highest fit {10110}. As a result, the average fitness value has increased from
117.25 to 140.
</p>
<p>The second operator is crossover. This creates two new solutions (children)
by selecting two existing ones (parents) and gluing pieces of each solution
together. For example, suppose that two solutions {10110} and {00010} are
selected from the selection process and a randomly chosen crossover position
is between the second and the third position. Then the first two digits of the
first solution (10) are replaced by the first two digits of the second solution
(00). The resulting two children solutions &ndash; {00110} and {10010} &ndash; have a
piece inherited from each of their parents solutions. The crossover probability
of 0.5 is typically used. That is, once we select two solutions, we flip a coin
to decide whether to apply the crossover operation to these two solutions.
</p>
<p>The final operator is mutation. Its role is to prevent some valuable com-
binations from consideration in succeeding generations. Solutions generated
by search and crossover depend on the initial set of solutions. Mutation pro-
vides an additional input not drawn from the initial set. Mutation therefore
helps avoid premature convergence to a local optimum. The probability of a
mutation is typically kept very small. When a mutation occurs, a bit changes
from 0 to 1, or 1 to 0. For instance, if the mutation occurs in the solu-
tion {10010}, we randomly determine the position of mutation. If it is the
third position, which is 0, it is changed to 1. The resulting solution becomes
{10110}. Changes introduced by mutation may often decrease the average
fitness value. But those mutated solution will not survive long.
</p>
<p>Genetic algorithms improve the fitness of the population by selection,
crossover and mutation as genes are passed from one generation to the next.
The generational process continues until a termination condition (e.g., fixed
number of generations) has been reached. Genetic algorithms do not guaran-
tee the exact optimal solution, but they do a good job of getting close to the
optimal solution quickly. See Chapter 27 for a detailed discussion of Gatarski
(2002) use of a genetic algorithm to develop banner advertisements.</p>

<p>19.6 Bayesian Networks
</p>
<p>Bayesian networks have made significant contributions in various fields such
as software engineering, space navigation and medical diagnosis since Pearl
(1988) published the first book on the topic (Haddawy 1999). Unlike tradi-
tional statistical models (e.g., logistic regression), Bayesian networks do not
make any stringent assumptions on the types of data and their distributions
(e.g., normality). In addition, they can effectively handle nonlinearity and
take on any structure (Heckerman 1997; Cui et al. 2006).
</p>
<p>Marketing researchers have begun to recognize Bayesian networks as an
alternative to structural equations models. Cooper (2000) used Bayesian net-
works for strategic marketing planning of radically new products. The factors
identified in an extensive situation analysis are woven into the economic webs
surrounding the new product. The webs are mapped into Bayesian networks
that can be updated as events unfold and used to simulate the impact that
changes in assumptions underlying the web have on the prospects for the new
product. Blodgett and Anderson (2000) applied a Bayesian network to the
consumer complaint process. They generated several interesting findings. For
example, the probability that a noncomplainer or a dissatisfied complainant
will completely exit is quite low. On the other hand, the probability that a
satisfied complainant will fully repatronize the retailer and engage in positive
word of mouth is quite high. Finally, Cui et al. (2006) employed Bayesian net-
works (learned by evolutionary programming) to model consumer responses
to direct marketing. They compared Bayesian networks with neural net-
works, decision trees (e.g., CART), and latent class regression, and found
that Bayesian networks have advantages in accuracy of prediction,6 trans-
parency of procedures, interpretability of results, and explanatory insight.
</p>
<p>The key feature of Bayesian networks is to provide a method of decompos-
ing a complex joint probability distribution into a set of simple local distribu-
tions. Bayesian networks achieve this simplification through a directed acyclic
graph. Nodes in the graph represent (random) variables and arcs represent
the probabilistic correlation between the variables. Suppose we are interested
in looking for relationships among a set of variables X = {X1, . . . , Xn}. The
Bayesian network is a graphical model that efficiently represents (&ldquo;encodes&rdquo;)
the joint distribution for X. It consists of (1) a network structure S that en-
codes a set of conditional independence assumptions on variables in X, and
(2) a set P of local probability distributions associated with each variable
(Herkerman 1997). The structure S is a directed acyclic graph whose nodes
represent variables Xi&rsquo;s. If there is an arc from variable Xi to Xj , then vari-
able Xj depends directly on Xi and Xi is called a parent of Xj . We denote
parents(Xi) to be the parents of variable Xi in S as well as the variables
corresponding to those parents. Given a structureS, the joint probability
</p>
<p>6 In their tenfold cross-validation comparison, Bayesian networks provide the highest
average lift in the top decile, followed by latent class regression, neural networks, and
CART. In the second decile, however, the neural networks have the highest cumulative
lift, followed by Bayesian networks, CART, and latent class regression.</p>

<p>i=1
</p>

</p>
<p>The local probability distributions P are the distributions of p(Xi|
parents(Xi)). As a result, the pair (S, P ) encodes the joint distribution p(X).
</p>
<p>One advantage of a Bayesian network is that it is intuitively easier to un-
derstand its direct dependencies and local distributions than the joint distri-
bution. For example, Fig. 19.3 shows a Bayesian network model for handling
customer complaints provided by Cui et al. (2006). There are five binary
variables: regular customer, unhappy incident, service recovery, repeat busi-
ness and happy customer. The joint probability distribution table (without
the Bayesian network structure) would have 25 &minus; 1 = 31 entries. However, a
Bayesian network model in Fig. 19.3 has only 10 probability values.
</p>
<p>The success of a Bayesian network mainly depends on a network structure
S that encodes a set of conditional independence assertions about variables in
X. In the model of customer complaints in Fig. 19.3, we have the conditional
independencies
</p>
<p>P (rc|ui) = P (rc)
P (rb|rc, ui) = P (rb|rc)
</p>
<p>P (sr|rc, ui, rb) = P (sr|rc, ui)
P (hc|sr, rc, ui, rb) = P (hc|sr, rc, ui)
</p>
<p>For example, the first relationship depicts the assertion that being a regular
customer is unrelated to whether an unhappy incident occurs. Given the
above four conditional independencies, we can obtain the model structure for
the customer complaint model in Fig. 19.3.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>486 19 Machine Learning
</p>
<p>Although the structure of a Bayesian network is formally defined as a set
of conditional independence assertions about variables, it is often constructed
using the notion of causal relationships (Heckerman 1997). In particular, we
simply draw arcs from cause variables to their effect variables. For instance,
given the assertion that Regular Customer is a direct cause of Repeat Business
and Service Recovery, Unhappy Incident is a direct cause of Service Recovery,
and Service Recovery is the direct cause of Happy Customer, we obtain the
network structure in Fig. 19.3.
</p>
<p>Once we estimate the Bayesian network model, we can make probabilistic
inferences directly from the local probabilities p(Xi|parents(Xi)).7 The in-
ference is based on the direct causes as depicted in the model specification,
without making any restrictive distributional assumptions on the local prob-
abilities. For example, Service Recovery (sr) leads to Happy Customer (hc)
in Fig. 19.3. Then
</p>
<p>P (sr) = P (sr|rc, ui)P (rc)P (ui) + P (sr| &sim; rc, ui)P (&sim; rc)P (ui)
+P (sr|rc,&sim; ui)P (rc)P (&sim; ui) + P (sr| &sim; rc,&sim; ui)P (&sim; rc)P (&sim; ui)
</p>
<p>= (.99)(.15)(.01) + (.90)(.85)(.01) + (.97)(.15)(.99) + (.03)(.85)(.99)
= 0.1784
</p>
<p>P (hc) = P (hc|sr)P (sr) + P (hc | &sim; sr)P (&sim; sr) = (.7)(.1784) + (.01)(.8216)
= 0.1331
</p>
<p>We can also calculate the posterior probability of Service Recovery when the
chosen customer is a Happy Customer by
</p>
<p>P (sr|hc) = P (hc|sr)P (sr)/P (hc) = (.7)(.1784)/(.1331) = 0.9383
Blodgett and Anderson (2000) discuss the advantages of Bayesian networks
over traditional causal models such as structural equation models. As men-
tioned, Bayesian networks are nonparametric so that no functional form or
distributional assumptions are necessary for inference. In contrast, structural
equation models are parametric in both distribution and function (e.g., nor-
mality, linearity and common factor theory). Another advantage of Bayesian
networks is that both forward and backward inferences are possible. We can
make predictions with forward inferences (e.g., P (hc|sr)) whereas backward
inferences can address profile questions (e.g., P (rc|hc)). The main weaknesses
of Bayesian networks are computational complexities and a relatively large
sample size necessary for estimation.

<p>19.7 Support Vector Machines 487
</p>
<p>Fig. 19.4 Optimal hyperplane and support vectors in feature space.
</p>
<p>section, we briefly describe the fundamental concepts of support vector ma-
chines and their advantages over traditional statistical methodologies since
their complete treatment is mathematically demanding. See Burges (1998)
for technical details of support vector machines and Cui and Curry (2005)
for their marketing application.
</p>
<p>In Chapter 15, we describe how discriminant analysis performs classifi-
cation. Its key idea is to express the class as a linear combination of the
independent variables (or attributes). For example, consider the training
sample of size N , {xi, yi} where xi is the vector of independent variables
for observation i (i = 1, . . . , N) and yi is the corresponding response. To
simplify our exposition, we assume that the class represented by the sub-
set di = 1 is linearly separable from the class of the subset di = &minus;1. The
hyperplane that linearly separates the two classes has the functional form
β&prime;x = β0x0 + β1x1 + . . . + βkxk = 0. That is, β&prime;x &gt; 0 for di = 1 and
β&prime;x &lt; 0 for di = &minus;1. The goal of support vector machine is to find the
particular hyperplane (called the optimal hyperplane) which maximally sep-
arates two classes (Witten and Frank 2000; Flach 2001). Figure 19.4 illus-
trates the optimal hyperplane for 30 training instances with two independent
variables.
</p>
<p>Suppose weighting vector βo defines the optimal hyperplane. That is, the
optimal hyperplane is algebraically defined as β&prime;ox = 0. The observations
that are closest to the optimal hyperplane are called support vectors xs.8
</p>
<p>These vectors play a critical role in support vector machines. Since support
</p>
<p>8 We can derive the optimal weighting vector by solving a quadratic optimization problem.
</p>
<p>Support vectors can be derived once the optimal weighting vector is determined. For
</p>
<p>detailed discussion, see Cui and Curry (2005) or Haykin (1999).</p>

<p>vectors lie closest to the decision surface, they are the most difficult to clas-
sify. Support vectors reduce the number of instances (or observations) re-
quired to predict or classify a new instance. Figure 19.4 shows the scatter
plot of 30 training instances with two attributes. All instances above the
optimal hyperplane are class As while all instances below the hyperplane
are class Bs. Only the instances circled &ndash; called support instances &ndash; are
required to classify new instances. The rest of the instances play no role in
predicting the class of new instances. As a result, we reduce the number of in-
stances from 30 to 10. The set of support vectors uniquely defines the optimal
hyperplane.
</p>
<p>The biggest disadvantage of the linear hyperplane is that it can only rep-
resent linear boundaries between classes (Witten and Frank 2000). One way
of overcoming this restriction is to transform the instance space into a new
&ldquo;feature&rdquo; space with a nonlinear mapping. A straight line in feature space
does not look straight in the original instance space. That is, a linear model
constructed in feature space can represent a nonlinear boundary in the orig-
inal space. For example, given two independent variables, the linear model
is Y = β1x1 + β2x2. If we allow for all products with two factors, we have
Y = α1x21 + α2x1x2 + α3x
</p>
<p>2
2. The original observations (or instances) x&rsquo;s are
</p>
<p>mapped into a feature space of z&rsquo;s (e.g., z1 = x21, z2 = x1x2 and z3 = x
2
2).
</p>
<p>The model is nonlinear in the original space whereas it is linear in feature
space. We can add more flexibility to the model by assuming polynomials of
sufficiently high degree (instead of two factors).
</p>
<p>The idea of support vector machines is based on two mathematical op-
erations: (1) nonlinear mapping of the original instance space into a high-
dimensional feature space, and (2) construction of an optimal hyperplane to
separate the classes. In other words, we need to derive the optimal hyper-
plane defined as a linear function of vectors drawn from the feature space
rather than the original instance space (Haykin 1999). We construct this
hyperplane in accordance with the principle of structural risk minimization
(Vapnik 1995).
</p>
<p>Let x denote a vector of independent variables drawn from the input
space, assumed to be of dimension K. Let ϕm(x) denote a set of nonlin-
ear transformations from the input space to the feature space where the
dimension of the feature space is M . Define the feature vector ϕ(x) =
[ϕ0(x), ϕ1(x), . . . , ϕM (x)]&prime; where ϕ0(x) = 1 for all x. Similar to the linear
hyperplane, we can define a hyperplane given a set of features:
</p>
<p>β&prime;ϕ(x) = 0 (19.6)
</p>
<p>We can now derive the weighting vector βo that defines the hyperplane in
feature space that optimally separates the classes (see Haykin (1999) for its
detailed derivation):
</p>
<p>βo =
&sum;I
</p>
<p>i=1
αidiϕ(xi) (19.7)
</p>
<p>where I is the number of support vectors, ϕ(xi) denotes the feature vector
corresponding to the input pattern xi in the ith support vector, di is the</p>

</p>
<p>response (or class) indicator (1 or &minus;1) and αi is the Lagrange multiplier.
Substituting Equation 19.7 into 19.6, we have the optimal hyperplane.&sum;I
</p>
<p>i=1
αidiϕ
</p>
<p>&prime;(xi)ϕ(x) =

</p>
<p>i=1

</p>
<p>The term in Equation 19.8 denoted byK(xi,x) = ϕ&prime;(xi)ϕ(x) =
&sum;M
</p>
<p>m=0 ϕm(x)
ϕm(xi) is called the inner-product kernel. Note that M is the number of
features plus the intercept. It represents the inner product of two vectors
induced in the feature space by the input vector x and the input pattern xi
pertaining to the ith support vector. Various functions can be employed for
the inner-product kernel. The most popular one may be a polynomial kernel
where K(xi,x) = (x&prime;xi + 1)p where power p is specified a priori by the user.
A good way of choosing the value of p is to start with 1 (e.g., linear model)
and increase the value until the errors cease to improve (Witten and Frank
2000). An alternative kernel function is the radial-basis function kernel where
K(xi,x) = exp(&minus;‖x&minus; xi‖2 /(2σ2)) where σ2 is specified a priori by the user.
The support vector machine with the radial-basis function kernel is simply
a radial-basis function network that is a type of neural network specification
(see Chapter 18). Finally, the support vector machine with the logistic kernel
is a multilayer perceptron with no hidden layers which is another type of
neural network. This is why support vector machines are often considered an
extension of neural networks (Flach 2001). However, support vector machines
offer a much more sophisticated mechanism to incorporate domain knowledge
by means of kernels.
</p>
<p>The support vector machine is an excellent semi-parametric technique that
has great potential in prediction and classification. Cui and Curry (2005)
introduced support vector machines to marketing, and showed it has sig-
nificantly better predictive performance over the multinomial logit model
in a simulation test. Its major drawbacks for database marketers may be
that its implementation is mathematically complex and there is no off-the-
shelf software available. However, we expect that in the near future database
marketers will use support vector machines especially when the relationship
between independent variables and the dependent variable is complex.
</p>
<p>19.8 Combining Multiple Models: Committee Machines
</p>
<p>When people make critical decisions, they usually consider opinions from
several experts. In machine learning, each estimated model for a given set of
training data constitutes an expert. We may be able to improve our decision
(or prediction) if we combine the outputs from several different models. The
combination of experts is said to constitute a &ldquo;committee machine&rdquo; (Haykin
1999). The original idea of a committee machine is traced back to Nilsson
(1965), but was made popular by Breiman (1996). There are various ways
of combining multiple models; they potentially perform better than a single</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>490 19 Machine Learning
</p>
<p>model. However, they all share a disadvantage of interpretation. It is difficult
to understand which factors are contributing to improved prediction (Witten
and Frank 2000).
</p>
<p>Committee machines have received increasing attention in various disci-
plines (see Haykin (1999) and Lemmens and Croux (2006) for references).
In marketing, Lemmens and Croux (2006) applied the bagging and boosting
of binary logit to predicting churn in a wireless telecommunications com-
pany. They showed that both bagging and boosting significantly improved
prediction accuracy compared to a binary logit.
</p>
<p>19.8.1 Bagging
</p>
<p>A simple way of combining the predictions from multiple models into a
single prediction is to take a (weighted) vote for a classification task and
a (weighted) average for numeric prediction. Bagging adopts this sim-
ple approach. We denote the estimation (or calibration) sample as Z =
{(x1, y1), . . . , (xN , yN )} where N is the total number of observations, xi rep-
resents k predictors for observation i (xi = (xi1, . . . , xiK)), and yi represents
the value of the dependent variable for observation i. From the original esti-
mation sample, we generate B bootstrap samples of size N,Z1,Z2, . . . ,ZB .
The term bagging actually stands for &ldquo;bootstrap aggregating&rdquo; (Breiman
1996). As we described in Chapter 11, each observation of size N in each
bootstrap sample is randomly drawn from the original estimation sample,
with replacement. Through this sampling procedure, each bootstrap sample
deletes and replicates some observations in the original sample. Once B boot-
strap samples are constructed, a model (e.g., logistic regression or decision
trees) is applied to each bootstrap sample. Prediction is based on a vote for
classification from each estimated model and an average value for numeric
prediction.
</p>
<p>The effect of bagging can be viewed through the statistical lens of bias-
variance decomposition (Witten and Frank 2000). Let x denote a set of inde-
pendent variables not seen before and y denote the corresponding dependent
variable. That is, x and y are realizations of the random vector X and ran-
dom variable Y . Let F (x) denote the model predicting y. The expected mean
squared error of F (x) with respect to E[Y |X = x] can be decomposed into
the bias and the variance.
</p>
<p>E[MSE]
= E[Pr edictd&minus;Actual]
= E[(F (x)&minus; E[Y |X = x])2]
= (E[F (x)]&minus; E[Y |X = x])2 + E[(F (x)&minus; E[F (x)])2]
= B[F (x)] + V [F (x)]
</p>
<p>(19.9)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>19.8 Combining Multiple Models: Committee Machines 491
</p>
<p>where B[F (x)] is the bias squared and V [F (x)] is the variance. The bias of
the model is a systematic error that cannot be eliminated even by employing
an infinite number of observations for estimation. However, the variance com-
ponent comes from the particular estimation sample used, which is randomly
selected from the true population and so is not perfectly representative. Bag-
ging reduces the mean square error by decreasing the variance of the model
(Haykin 1999). That is, bagging averages out the instability of a model ap-
plied to a particular estimation sample by constructing several bootstrap
samples.
</p>
<p>19.8.2 Boosting
</p>
<p>Bagging will be effective when the model&rsquo;s estimated parameters change dras-
tically over different bootstrap samples. That is, bagging addresses the in-
stability of the model. Therefore, bagging does not work well with a robust
model (e.g., linear model) in which predictions of the model change very little
across bootstrap samples. Intuitively, it is only reasonable to combine multi-
ple models with significantly different predictions (Witten and Frank 2000).
That is, combining methods will be effective when models complement each
other. Boosting exploits this insight by searching for models that complement
each other.
</p>
<p>Boosting is similar to bagging in combining predictions (votes or numerical
values) of individual models. However, the main difference between boosting
and bagging lies in the sampling scheme. Boosting sequentially estimates
a model applied to adaptively re-weighted samples. More specifically, the
boosting algorithm starts with assigning equal weight to all observations in
the calibration sample. Once the model is estimated, we re-weight each ob-
servation according to the model&rsquo;s output. The weight of correctly classified
observations is decreased, and that of misclassified ones is increased (Witten
and Frank 2000). With this weighting scheme, we attempt to focus on classify-
ing observations with high weights that are hard-to-classify (or misclassified)
observations correctly. Such observations become more important because
there is greater incentive to classify them correctly. By assigning weights to
each observation, boosting provides an elegant way of generating a series of
experts that complement one another. In the next iteration, the model is
applied to the re-weighted calibration sample. There are several weighting
schemes available, but we only introduce a widely used method called Ad-
aBoost.M1 (Freund and Schapire 1996). For each iteration, the weights of all
observations are updated as
</p>
<p>wi,t+1 = wi,t{(1&minus;Di,t) +Di,tet/(1&minus; et)} (19.10)
where wi,t represents the weight of observation i at iteration t,Di,t indicates
whether the observation is correctly classified (= 1 if correctly classified, and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>492 19 Machine Learning
</p>
<p>0 if misclassified), and et denotes the model&rsquo;s overall error (the percentage
misclassified) for the tth re-weighted calibration sample. Since each successive
sample is weighted more toward harder-to-classify observations, et tends to
increase with t. We stop the iterations when classification becomes so difficult
that et is worse than random prediction, i.e., greater than or equal to 0.5.
So assuming et &le; 0.5 and using Equation 19.10, the weights do not change
for misclassified observations while they decrease for correctly classified ones.
After all weights have been updated, they are renormalized such that their
sum at iteration t+ 1 remains the same as the sum of weights at iteration t.
For example, the renormalized weights of observation i at iteration t become
w&lowast;i,t+1 = wi,t+1(
</p>
<p>&sum;
i wi,t/
</p>
<p>&sum;
i wi,t+1). As a result, the renormalized weights of
</p>
<p>the misclassified observations increase whereas those of the correctly classified
ones decrease.
</p>
<p>19.8.3 Other Committee Machines
</p>
<p>Although bagging and boosting are popular, there are other methods
to combine outputs from multiple models. For example, Breiman (2001)
proposed a new classifier called a random forest which combines bagging
by Breiman (1996) and the random subspace method by Ho (1998). Similar
to bagging, a random forest combines the predictions from multiple (tree)
models into a single prediction by generating multiple bootstrap samples
and taking a weighted vote for a classification task. However, for each node
of the tree, it randomly chooses m input variables (out of M &gt; m input
variables) on which to base the decision at that node. That is, a random
forest incorporates two types of randomness, one from training samples and
the other from the input variables.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wolpert (1992) has proposed another interesting com-
mittee machine called the stacked generalization (called &ldquo;stacking&rdquo;). Its main
difference from bagging and boosting is its capability of combining multiple
models of different types. Stacking can combine different models (e.g., logistic
regression and decision trees) by introducing a &ldquo;meta learner&rdquo;. The predic-
tions of the base models (called level-0 models) become the input to the meta
model (also called level-1 model). The meta model attempts to discover which
base modes are the reliable ones and how to combine the predictions of the
base models. Stacking has not been used as often as bagging and boosting,
partially because it is analytically more demanding. For further materials on
stacking, see Witten and Frank (2000), and Ting and Witten (1997).
</p>
<p>Other techniques of combining multiple models include error-correcting
output codes (Dietterich and Bakiri 1995) and mixture of experts (Haykin
1999).</p>

<p>Acquiring Customers
</p>
<p>Abstract All firms must build their customer base by acquiring customers.
This chapter looks at the strategy and tactics for doing so. We start with the
customer equity framework, which integrates customer acquisition, retention,
and development. Key to that concept is the &ldquo;acquisition curve,&rdquo; which re-
lates expenditures on customer acquisition to the number of customers ac-
quired. We discuss strategies for increasing acquisition rates suggested by
the acquisition curve, and then present and elaborate on a framework for
developing customer acquisition programs.
</p>
<p>20.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>A critical function of database marketing is to enhance the firm&rsquo;s ability to
acquire customers. Blattberg et al. (2001) show that the total contribution
of a customer to the firm, customer &ldquo;equity&rdquo;, is the firm&rsquo;s cost of acquiring
a customer relative to the future stream of customer value. As the dotcoms
taught the market and database marketers, the cost of customer acquisition
can sink a business. For example, Pet.com had an acquisition cost of $400
per customer. What is the revenue and profit potential of acquiring a pet
food customer? Suppose the average customer spends $100 per purchase and
the incremental profit margin is $20 since the purchases are likely to be
heavily weighted to pet food, not the higher margin pet supplies. Then, it
would take 20 purchases before the customer breaks even, and that assumes
no costs associated with retaining customers. If there is a 75% chance on
each purchase occasion the customer is retained, can the business model of
Pet.com ever pay out? The answer is obvious. No. The value of that income
stream, assuming no discounting, is $80 and the cost of acquisition is $400.
Where is Pet.com today? Out of business.
</p>
<p>What drove the willingness of dotcoms to go public with such a poor
economic model? They believed that the acquisition cost would drop
significantly and they would then earn profits from retained customers.
</p>
<p>495</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>496 20 Acquiring Customers
</p>
<p>However, that belief was mistaken. Almost none of the dotcoms were able to
drive down their acquisition costs to a level that made it feasible to make a
profit.
</p>
<p>This chapter discusses theories and methods for customer acquisition.
Most of the marketing literature does not separate acquisition marketing from
retention marketing or add-on selling. Exceptions can be found in the new
product literature but most of this literature involves durable goods where
diffusion of innovation and the Bass model are used. These products are
not repeat purchased. There is a small literature on new non-durable goods
marketing (see, e.g., Blattberg and Golanty (1978)) that separates trial (ac-
quisition) from repeat (retention) but little has been written in recent years.
Therefore, this chapter will have relatively few references. This should not be
interpreted as lack of importance of the topic. Few academics have made a
distinction between acquisition marketing and marketing in general. Yet the
issues are different. Expectations play a very important role in acquisition,
particularly with respect to product quality. Pricing and promotion are the
lifeblood of acquisition marketing. It is more difficult to target acquisition
efforts than to target retention efforts. The opportunity for academics is a
wide open area of research.
</p>
<p>We begin with a description of an overall framework for analyzing customer
acquisition decisions. Then, we discuss drivers of customer acquisition. We
next discuss the acquisition marketing mix, including methods for targeting
customer acquisitions. We end with a brief discussion of relevant research
issues.
</p>
<p>20.2 The Fundamental Equation of Customer Equity
</p>
<p>Throughout this chapter we will use the fundamental equation of customer
equity as shown in Blattberg et al. (2001).

(20.1)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>Nt = the number of prospective customers available at time t.
αt = the acquisition probability at time t.
ASt = acquisition sales at time t.
ct = cost of goods sold at time t.
Ba,t = acquisition marketing investment at time t.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.3 Acquisition Costs 497
</p>
<p>ρj,t+k = retention rate at time t+ k for customers acquired at time j.
RSt = sales from retained customers at time t (including add-on sales).
Br,t = investment in retaining customers at time t.
BAO,t = investment in selling additional products to retained customers
</p>
<p>at time t.
d = the discount rate.
</p>
<p>This equation describes three elements of customer equity. The first part of
the expression shows the acquisition costs and initial benefits; the second
represents customer retention, and the last part portrays how much is sold
to customers and the profit margins obtained. Specifically,

<p>We will concentrate on acquisition. Equation 20.2a shows that the criti-
cal factors driving the contribution of acquisition to customer equity are:
(a)N , the market size, (b) α, the acquisition rate or probability of acquisition,
(c) B, the cost per customer contacted, and (d) S &minus; c, the profit margin of
sales to the acquired customer. Below, we will describe strategies associated
with each of these factors.
</p>
<p>20.3 Acquisition Costs
</p>
<p>The cost of acquiring customers is at the heart of acquisition market-
ing. Sophisticated database marketing firms compute the cost of acquir-
ing a customer and then trade it off versus the lifetime value of the cus-
tomer. An example will be used to demonstrate how most firms compute
the cost of customer acquisition. Then, we will discuss the types of data
required.
</p>
<p>Suppose a cataloger is analyzing the cost of acquiring new customers. As-
sume the firm uses a two-step acquisition process in which the firm advertises
in a targeted publication to attract prospects and then mails the catalog to
those who respond. The process enables the firm to identify the names of
prospects, and then acquire (or &ldquo;convert&rdquo;) them.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>498 20 Acquiring Customers
</p>
<p>Table 20.1 Cost of acquiring a customer
</p>
<p>Cost of advertisement $50,000
Number of respondents to advertisement 100,000
Cost of mailing individual catalog $2.00
Cost of catalog mailing $200,000
Response rate from catalog mailing 5%
Number of customers acquired 5,000
Acquisition cost before sales to acquired customers $250,000
Acquisition cost per customer before initial sale $50.00
Initial purchase $75.00
Initial margin 20%
Profit from purchase $15.00
</p>
<p>Acquisition cost per customer after including initial sale $35.00
</p>
<p>Table 20.1 shows the data. It costs the firm $50 to acquire a customer,
or $35 if the initial sale is included. The critical metrics in customer acquisi-
tion are the response rate to the initial mailing(s) or communications (e.g.,
Internet ad), costs associated with acquiring the customer, the number of
customers acquired, the profit from the initial sale and the future value of
these customers.
</p>
<p>Surprisingly, many firms do not know their cost of acquiring a new cus-
tomer. Partly, this is because many firms do not track it and partly because
some of the costs are difficult to allocate. For example, if this were a consumer
packaged-good product such as Tide detergent, it would be very difficult
to allocate media advertising between acquisition and retention marketing.
However, while it is difficult, the firm could begin to analyze how impor-
tant different types of advertising are for customer acquisition. Also, the firm
could try to determine how much of its advertising is targeted to acquisition
versus retention. Still, it is very difficult and hence why firms that use general
media do not allocate it to acquisition versus retention marketing.
</p>
<p>One must recognize that most customers are acquired at a loss, and only
pay out if their long-term contribution is large enough. To be effective the firm
should then try to determine how much it can afford to lose when acquiring
a customer. Without this metric firms may either over or more likely under-
invest in customer acquisition.
</p>
<p>Because firms lose money when they are acquiring customers, when eco-
nomic times are difficult, firms often decrease customer acquisition. A firm
can then &ldquo;milk&rdquo; its existing customers and not acquire customers. This
will increase short-term profitability but will cost profit growth in the long-
run. Blattberg et al. (2001, Chapter 8) address this issue by recommending
customer equity accounting statements so that firms are far less likely to
under-invest in customer acquisition and milk short-term profits (see also the
Customer Management Marketing Budget, Sect. 26.4.1, Chapter 26). The
next section discusses the factors that increase customer acquisition rates,
which as is obvious from the analysis of customer acquisition cost, is a criti-
cal parameter in decreasing the cost of acquisition.</p>

<p>20.4 Strategies for Increasing Number of Customers Acquired 499
</p>
<p>20.4 Strategies for Increasing Number of Customers
Acquired
</p>
<p>20.4.1 Increasing Market Size
</p>
<p>A critical driver in acquiring new customers is the number of potential cus-
tomers in the market for the product or service. Obviously, the larger the
number of prospective customers, the greater the market potential is. How-
ever, there is a trade-off. Marketers understand that increasing the size of
the target market can be detrimental because the positioning of the product
or service becomes amorphous and the product therefore fails to capture any
share of the market. The firm can therefore try to increase the size of the po-
tential number of customers (N) but in doing so, risks lowering the response
rate (α).
</p>
<p>What are some of the strategies used to increase the potential target mar-
ket for a product or service? The first and most obvious is to suggest or
develop new usage occasions. Examples abound, such as Arm &amp; Hammer
Baking Soda being used as a deodorizer and not just an ingredient in bak-
ing; cat litter being used to clean garage floors because of its absorbency;
American Express using a variant of a gift card as a mechanism to provide
cash to customers while they are overseas or on vacation. However, while we
can give examples, firms often have difficulty finding new usage occasions for
their products or services.
</p>
<p>It is often easier to target new customer segments. This is a common ac-
quisition strategy for firms. BMW introduced the 1 series; Johnny Walker
introduced gold and blue versions of its Scotch whiskey brand. Costco began
focusing on small businesses and then opened its warehouse club to individu-
als who were willing to pay an annual fee. Whole Foods began as an organic,
natural grocery store but has expanded to &ldquo;foodies&rdquo; who enjoy higher quality
products but also perceive the organic benefit as positive. USAA insurance
opened its insurance to family members as well as military officers.
</p>
<p>The major risk in trying to expand the size of the number of prospective
customers is losing focus on the brand&rsquo;s positioning. Sometimes it can work as
the above examples show but sometimes it does not. The consumer becomes
confused about the positioning of the brand. As BMW expands the reach
of its brand with lower-end offerings (1 series in Europe), it risks lack of
exclusivity and damaging its image. Mercedes faces the same problem. The
ultimate car example was Cadillac, which created the Cimarron in the late
seventies. It was a &ldquo;juiced-up&rdquo; version of the Chevrolet Cavalier. It hurt
the brand image of Cadillac because the consumer perceived Cadillac as no
longer representing a luxury vehicle. While expanding the market through
reaching new segments is obviously beneficial, the risks are significant. For
every success story, there is a failure. Firms must be very careful how they
approach this strategy.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>500 20 Acquiring Customers
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, any time the firm expands the markets it is trying
to reach, it jeopardizes reducing the acquisition rate (α). The broader the
market is, the lower the acquisition rate. By having a lower acquisition rate,
the cost of customer acquisition increases. While not necessarily problematic
(if the customer generates enough immediate and long-term profit), it can
lead to much lower return on invested capital and if the firm is not careful,
profits can be negative.
</p>
<p>20.4.2 Increasing Marketing Acquisition Expenditures
</p>
<p>An obvious mechanism for increasing the number of customers acquired is
to increase marketing expenditures on acquisition. The real issue is payout.
However, before discussing payout, it is important to understand standard
industry practice which is why this strategy becomes important. Several years
ago, the Greater Chicago Food Depository, which is a food bank designed to
feed the poor, decided to embark on a direct marketing campaign to raise
funds through individual donations. The campaign was very successful. In
fact, it was self funding: the acquisition expenditures were covered by the
initial donations. However the Food Depository did not want to increase
acquisition spending because it was above their allotted budget. This was a
poor decision. However, it is symptomatic of many organizations.
</p>
<p>Firms generally lose money on initial customer acquisition. They gener-
ally make up the loss on future purchases (dotcoms being a notable excep-
tion). The cost is recorded in the acquisition period and thus distorts the
profit picture to make the acquisition period&rsquo;s profits look worse. Because
of the short-term loss due to customer acquisitions, many firms under-invest
in customer acquisition. This accounting &ldquo;distortion&rdquo; results in firms failing
to capture the total potential of the future customer profit stream. In some
businesses, firms are allowed to amortize customer acquisition over the &ldquo;life&rdquo;
of the customer and those firms benefit because they can increase their cus-
tomer acquisition investment relative to firms who face traditional accounting
treatment of customer acquisition.
</p>
<p>Another customer acquisition investment is general media advertising (not
including direct marketing) to generate awareness of the product/service.
By generating awareness, the newly aware potentially acquired consumer
can seek out the product/service. This is becoming more common with the
Internet. Firms can generate awareness, which leads to visits to websites and
ultimately sales. Banner ads in which customers click through is an example.
See Manchanda et al. (2006) for a study of the economic and sales impact of
banner ads.
</p>
<p>An important (and ostensibly free) source of awareness is word-of-mouth.
Positive word-of-mouth also generates awareness as well as influences the
consumer&rsquo;s intention to purchase. Factors affecting positive word-of-mouth</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.4 Strategies for Increasing Number of Customers Acquired 501
</p>
<p>include product/service quality, the value of the product/service, and rel-
evant positioning of the product/service. Some firms rely exclusively on
word-of-mouth such as USAA. Many small businesses rely on word-of-
mouth as their primary source of new customers. Restaurants, movies
and other entertainment services utilize word-of-mouth as a key source
of customer acquisition. Some sophisticated marketing companies are us-
ing strategies to influence opinion leaders who provide credible word-of-
mouth. One major consumer products company has identified teenage
opinion leaders, uses direct marketing to reach and influence them, and
then through word-of-mouth, the opinion leaders influence other teenagers.
See Zhang (2006), who describes how word-of-mouth affects consumer
learning, another important factor affecting the efficiency of acquisition
spending.
</p>
<p>20.4.3 Changing the Shape of the Acquisition Curve
</p>
<p>The acquisition curve plots the probability of a customer being acquired as
a function of total acquisition spending. The shape of the acquisition curve
is critical to acquisition marketing. We have plotted two typical acquisition
curves in Fig. 20.1. The steeper the slope of the line, meaning the higher the
&ldquo;elasticity&rdquo; of response from additional spending, the more effective acquisi-
tion spending is. The reason the curve reaches an asymptote is that at some
level of spending it is almost impossible to acquire new customers. The more
important question is: how does a firm change the shape of the acquisition
curve?

</p>
<p>Breakeven cut-off: 1.5%
</p>
<p>The acquisition&ndash;spending curve is determined by how different segments
of the market respond to acquisition marketing. As the firm spends more on
acquisition in a given period (e.g., a year), it needs to dip deeper into the
pool of potential segments it can target. We will use a simple example to
highlight the issue.
</p>
<p>Table 20.2 shows a typical response chart from a series of test mail-
ings. Table 20.2 shows incremental change in response rates as spending in-
creases while Fig. 20.1 shows the cumulative number of customers acquired.
Figure 20.1 has decreasing returns. We have ranked the data from highest to
lowest response as well as the size of the potential mailing to each list and
the spending required for mailing the list. The table shows overall response
rate. As the firm increases its acquisition mailings and spending, its overall
response rate declines. The reason is simple. Firms target their best sources
for acquisition first and then are forced to reach lower and lower into the pool
of potential sources of names for acquisition as spending increases.
</p>
<p>How then can a firm change the shape of its acquisition&ndash;spending curve?
There are two answers. First, the firm can improve its targeting strategy. This
is at the heart of database marketing. By finding better sources of names or
identifying more responsive targets, the firm will increase its response rate
for a fixed acquisition investment. Second, the firm can use various methods
to drive up response rates such as using two-step communication strategies
as described earlier1 or investing in general media advertising to increase
awareness and to position the product/service to increase the response rate.
</p>
<p>Later in this chapter, we describe methods to improve the firm&rsquo;s targeting.
However, improved targeting requires:
</p>
<p>&bull; A clear understanding of who the firm&rsquo;s target audiences are
&bull; Testing and measurement
</p>
<p>1 An example of a two-step campaign begins with step 1 which might be an advertising
in a magazine to generate prospects and step 2 using direct marketing to convert the
leads into customers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.4 Strategies for Increasing Number of Customers Acquired 503
</p>
<p>&bull; Creative new ways to target consumers
&bull; The use of new media
</p>
<p>Using different marketing and communication vehicles to increase acquisition
response rates requires testing and measurement. Surprisingly, few firms be-
yond database marketers are good at testing and measurement because of
the discipline it requires. Some firms are disciplined but cannot easily track
customer acquisition because they sell through intermediaries rather than
direct.
</p>
<p>Many of the ways that acquisition response rates are increased is through
&ldquo;acquisition enhancing vehicles&rdquo;. Firms must track and measure the impact
of these vehicles. For example, a firm uses general advertising to generate
awareness and create an overall positioning of its brand. Their general media
advertising should then increase response rates to direct marketing communi-
cations or should generate some number of customers who seek out the firm&rsquo;s
products/services. Without tracking it is impossible to determine if general
media advertising is producing the desired result. This in turn makes it very
difficult to measure the economic payout of the advertising campaign.
</p>
<p>20.4.4 Using Lead Products
</p>
<p>Another acquisition strategy is to identify lead products to acquire customers.
Once the firm has acquired the customer, other products/services are sold
to the customer. In the old days direct marketing insurance companies used
a product called accidental death and dismemberment insurance. It was in-
expensive since most people are rarely dismembered and accidental death
(versus natural causes) was also relatively unlikely. Once the customer was
acquired through this product, the firm then focused on selling other insur-
ance products. Automobile companies sell &ldquo;lower priced&rdquo; products to bring
the customer into the family of products and then over time hope to sell them
more expensive ones. Grocery retailers use Coke and Pepsi to bring customers
into the store with the goal of selling related products and building the size
of the basket.
Lead products have certain characteristics:
</p>
<p>&bull; Broad appeal relative to other products/service in the firm&rsquo;s product line
&bull; Entry level price points
&bull; Consistency with the firm&rsquo;s image/positioning
</p>
<p>Notice that high margin is not one of the characteristics. Some firms try to
use expensive, high margin products to generate initial trial but this is likely
to reduce, not increase acquisition rates. The goal is that once a customer
makes an initial purchase, then the firm can sell the customer more expensive
products/services. American Express acquires customers through its Green
card in hopes of later selling them a Platinum card. BMW sells the 1 series</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>504 20 Acquiring Customers
</p>
<p>in Europe in hopes of selling the 3, 5 and 7 series to the customer on the next
purchase.
</p>
<p>Obviously the use of lead products does not fit every business. How does
Procter and Gamble use lead products? They instead use sampling or trial
sizes to create initial trial and then hope to sell the larger sizes after the
customer evaluates the product. Only firms that have extensive product lines
they can cross-sell to the customer have the capability of using lead products
as a customer acquisition vehicle.
</p>
<p>20.4.5 Acquisition Pricing and Promotions
</p>
<p>An obvious way to affect acquisition rates is through pricing and promotions.
As the price decreases, acquisition rates almost always increase. The same
with promotions, they can increase the acquisition rate. The caveat is that
using price and promotions to acquire customers can affect future purchases.
Part of the reason is that acquisition pricing and promotional discounts can
influence the consumers overall reference price and image of the firm. If the
firm offers a steep discount to acquire a customer, when the customer either
renews the product/service or purchases another product/service he or she
expects a discount and a low price. Customers develop expectations about
the firm&rsquo;s pricing which is then used to evaluate future prices. The lower the
introductory price or the more aggressive the introductory promotion, the
lower will be the renewal rate unless the firm again offers an aggressive
discount.
</p>
<p>Acquisition pricing and promotion also influence which segments of cus-
tomers are acquired. The lower the acquisition price or the more aggressive
the promotion is, the more likely the consumers that are being attracted are
price sensitive consumers. The pricing and promotional strategy for acquir-
ing customers determines the pool of customers who will be available to ei-
ther cross-sell and/or renew. Customer retention and cross-selling potentially
depend upon the acquisition strategy being used.
</p>
<p>Models can be developed that link acquisition and retention pricing.
Thomas et al. (2004a) indirectly consider this issue in the context of a news-
paper renewal. The focus of their paper is on renewal pricing, not acquisition
pricing, but clearly both are related. Thomas (2001) shows how acquisition
and retention can be jointly modeled using a Type II Tobit model. Feasibly,
if acquisition price were included in the selection (acquisition) equation and
retention price were included in the regression (retention) equation, the two
prices could be optimized. Reinartz et al. (2005) extension of this model could
also be used to optimize prices (see Chapter 26 for further discussion of these
models).
</p>
<p>Simple models of acquisition pricing, covered in more detail in Chapter 29,
show that acquisition pricing depends upon the long-run value of the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.5 Developing a Customer Acquisition Program 505
</p>
<p>customer. The higher the long-run value of the customer, the lower the firm
should make the acquisition price. The reason is obvious. The higher the
firm&rsquo;s &ldquo;backend&rdquo; profits &ndash; profits after acquisition &ndash; the greater incentive the
firm can offer to acquire customers. Similar arguments can be made for pro-
motional discounting. Again the higher the firm&rsquo;s backend profits, the deeper
the firm can discount to acquire customers.
</p>
<p>There are two critical assumptions associated with the above argument.
The first is that there is no relationship between the consumer&rsquo;s acquisition
reservation price and retention reservation price. The literature on reference
prices (see Briesch et al. 1997) makes this assumption tenuous. A potential
model structure for considering how acquisition prices may affect retention
price sensitivity coefficient is ln(βr) = βo + δ apt&minus;1 where βr = retention
price coefficient and apt = acquisition price at time t and βo is a constant
influencing the overall price sensitivity. In words, the price last used to acquire
customers influences retention price sensitivity. If the sign of δ is negative,
higher acquisition prices get higher retention price sensitivity.
</p>
<p>The second assumption is that the customers are homogeneous in price
sensitivity. Clearly this assumption is violated. Direct marketers have long
believed that as the firm lowers acquisition prices or as it uses deep dis-
counts to acquire customers, price sensitive customers are then acquired. If
retention prices are significantly higher than acquisition prices including the
promotional discounts offered, price sensitive customers acquired will not re-
new. Because the firm loses money on acquiring customers, it can be very
costly to acquire price sensitive customers because they will result in a net
loss over their total lifetime which is likely to be only one purchase.
</p>
<p>The above issues are covered in far more detail in the Chapter 29, which
focuses on pricing. However, in designing an acquisition strategy, the firm
must carefully consider the implications of its acquisition pricing strategy.
</p>
<p>20.5 Developing a Customer Acquisition Program
</p>
<p>20.5.1 Framework
</p>
<p>To help understand customer acquisition, we present a schematic framework
similar to those used in consumer behavior research. It highlights many of the
issues in the design of customer acquisition strategies. We will briefly describe
the model and its implications. The model draws on both the marketing
literature and a previous descriptive model developed in Blattberg et al.
(2001, Chapter 3).
</p>
<p>Figure 20.2 presents the framework. The critical elements of this model are:
(a) consumers develop expectations, partly influenced by the firm, which are
then updated through their purchase experiences and the objective quality
of the product/service; (b) consumers are heterogeneous and the firm must</p>

</p>
<p>The firm directly controls (a) the true quality of the product/service,
(b) marketing communications to create awareness and establish position-
ing, (c) segmentation and targeting of potential consumers, and (d) pricing
and promotion.
</p>
<p>Having discussed pricing and promotion earlier, we will focus the dis-
cussion on (1) segmentation, targeting and positioning, (2) product/service
offering, (3) targeting methods, and media selection.
</p>
<p>20.5.2 Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning (STP)
</p>
<p>Interwoven in some of the examples used earlier is the identification of poten-
tially viable segments to target. There are different methods of segmenting,
many of which are covered in basic marketing texts (Kotler and Keller 2006,
pp. 37, 310) and they will not be discussed here. It is important to recog-
nize that the more finely the segments can be defined, the more precisely the
firm can target. If the firm only uses broadly defined segments (e.g., women
18&ndash;49), it may be better for the firm to mass market.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.5 Developing a Customer Acquisition Program 507
</p>
<p>Targeting is choosing the relevant segments whose customers the firm will
invest its marketing resources to acquire. The ability to select the appropri-
ate targets is extremely valuable. The greater the firm&rsquo;s ability to target,
the higher the firm&rsquo;s acquisition response rate is. Better targeting does not
necessarily mean that the firm should avoid going deeply into the acquisition
file, because there may be customers who are unprofitable in the short term
but profitable in the long term.
</p>
<p>Positioning is critical. If the firm&rsquo;s positioning for a given product/service
does not match the quality and benefits offered in the positioning statement,
consumer&rsquo;s expectations are not matched when the product/service experi-
ence occurs. The likely outcome is lower repeat-purchasing rates. The difficult
trade-off is designing an aggressive acquisition positioning statement to in-
crease acquisition response rates while maintaining high repeat purchasing
rates. When a firm over-promises about the merits of its product/service of-
fering during acquisition marketing, it lowers its retention rates. Obviously,
this is an important trade-off though there is very little research on the topic
of how much retention declines because of over promising about the product/
service offering during customer acquisition.
</p>
<p>20.5.3 Product/Service Offering
</p>
<p>The firm must understand the tangible and intangible attributes of the prod-
uct/service being offered. This assessment must be objectively determined.
It will ultimately be matched against the customer&rsquo;s expectations driven
by marketing and other related contacts the customer has with the prod-
uct/service. For example, the firm must realistically understand the quality
of its product/service otherwise it will, in all likelihood, over-promise and
under-deliver. Setting customer&rsquo;s expectations is critical to customer reten-
tion.
</p>
<p>Examples abound of firms that over-promise and then have great difficulty
with customer retention. The most notorious example is used-car salesper-
sons. Used-car salespersons do anything to make the immediate sale but very
few of their customers ever return. In the US Car Max and Auto Nation
have tried to overcome this problem by offering warranties on used cars and
by carefully evaluating and servicing the used (now called &ldquo;pre-owned&rdquo;) cars
sold to ensure they are less likely to have service and quality problems. Deal-
ers now sell &ldquo;authorized used cars&rdquo; again to overcome this problem, where
the cars are inspected and serviced to bring them up to a certain standard.
</p>
<p>It is essential strategically that the firm understands its product/service
quality and then targets the appropriate audience and position the prod-
uct/service to set the appropriate expectations. A firm that has been very
effective is Southwest Airlines. Its product/service is very basic. No first class,
no frills, no fancy meals, no complex ticketing. They offer reliable, low-priced</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>508 20 Acquiring Customers
</p>
<p>airline service. Southwest&rsquo;s advertising tag line was &ldquo;We fly for Peanuts&rdquo;
which is a play on words. At one time, they only served peanuts as food
on their flights. Flying for Peanuts also means flying for low fares. Thus,
Southwest&rsquo;s delivers on its brand promise. Expectations meet actual cus-
tomer experience. By managing expectations properly, Southwest was able
to deliver no-frills service.
</p>
<p>Target stores uses as its brand promise &ndash; &ldquo;Expect more, pay less&rdquo;. It
has been one of the few retailers able to compete effectively against Wal-
Mart. By keeping its margins relatively low, Target is able to offer affordable
fashion aimed at women. Instead of over-promising on being very chic as
many department stores attempt to do, it recognizes its niche is affordable
fashion.
</p>
<p>20.5.4 Acquisition Targeting
</p>
<p>Acquisition targeting and media strategies are the most well researched area
in acquisition marketing. Numerous books cover how to target (see Hughes
2000; Sheppard 1999; Jackson and Wang 1994). The issue that needs to be
addressed in acquisition targeting is: can the firm use various data and statis-
tical methods to reach target segments more effectively than mass marketing?
The general belief is that the firm can. The methods used by firms include
finding relevant databases of target segments, testing, profiling and predictive
modeling.
</p>
<p>It is important to understand that sometimes it is better not to target and
instead use general low-cost media for customer acquisition. One of the best
examples is couponing. Assume the cost is $10 per thousand to distribute
and produce the coupons. Suppose a firm distributes 50,000,000 FSI (free-
standing inserts) coupons to acquire customers. Assume the response rate is
approximately 3% which translates into 1,500,000 coupons redeemed. Of the
1,500,000 coupons redeemed, 5% are new customers to the brand. Thus, the
firm acquired 75,000 customers. The cost of the coupon drop is $10.00 per
thousand and the face value of the coupon is $0.50. This translates into a
cost of $500,000 for the coupon drop and $750,000 for coupon redemption.
The cost of acquiring each new customer is $16.67. Table 20.3 provides the
calculations.
</p>
<p>An alternative is for the firm to use targeted marketing to acquire cus-
tomers. The firm, through a retailer&rsquo;s frequent shopper card, was able to
send 3,000,000 coupons at a cost of $0.50 per coupon or $500 per thousand
which is 50 times higher than the cost of an FSI.2 However, the firm had a
6% response rate (higher than the 3% for the coupon) and of the 180,000
coupons redeemed 30% were new customers to the brand. The number of
</p>
<p>2 In the 1990s there were a number of firms who tried to market highly targeted coupons.
Because of the high cost to reach customers, none was successful.</p>

</p>
<p>new customers was 54,000. The total cost of the direct marketing campaign
was $1,590,000. The cost to acquire a new customer was $29.44.
</p>
<p>This is an illustrative example but it shows that the firm may be better
off using an untargeted vehicle to acquire customers. It depends upon the
financial structure of the two alternatives. Because the cost of targeting can
be exceptionally high in certain industries (e.g., consumer packaged goods),
it may be more efficient to use mass vehicles to acquire customers and then
use targeting for customer retention. Alternatively, firms use two-step systems
where mass media is used to qualify or identify prospects and direct marketing
to the prospects is used to convert the prospects to customers.
</p>
<p>Because the success of targeted acquisition is not guaranteed, one must
follow a carefully orchestrated series of steps. The first step is to identify
sources of prospective names. Different methods are available to identify po-
tential sources of names and are discussed in the next section. Once the target
segment(s) are determined, the firm must find a vehicle to reach them. List
brokers can provide lists of addressable names within each target segment.
Then the firm can test these lists.
</p>
<p>An alternative form of acquisition has emerged that combines elements of
targeted and mass marketed acquisition &ndash; the Internet; e.g., the firm can in-
clude a banner ad based on certain word searchers using a search engine (e.g.,
Google). This type of targeting allows prospects to self-select by searching for
information using certain key words. As individuals search for a certain words,
they are signaling their interest in the product or service. The firm then
intervenes with an ad which hopefully leads to qualified prospects. This ap-
proach is mass marketing in the sense that ads are being placed in the equiv-
alent of a magazine or television program, however, the placement is targeted</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>510 20 Acquiring Customers
</p>
<p>based on interests the consumer implicitly reveals. Again the success of this
type of prospecting depends upon the economic return. For example, Verhoef
and Donkers (2005) find that the long-term value of a customer, measured
by retention and cross-selling opportunities, are roughly average for Internet-
acquired customers compared to other acquisition vehicles such as outbound
telephone, TV/radio, and direct mail. (See Chapter 25 for further discussion
of the value of alternative channels as acquisition tools.)
</p>
<p>20.5.5 Targeting Methods for Customer Acquisition
</p>
<p>There are several commonly used methods for targeting: profiling, predictive
models using demographics or customer characteristics, random testing of
prospect databases, and two-step acquisition programs. Each has benefits.
</p>
<p>The basic rule is: it is difficult to develop accurate targeting methods for
customer acquisition. Unlike targeting and managing existing customers, the
data available for customer acquisition is very limited. Firms sell demographic
or customer characteristic data (examples are Experian or Axciom) but these
data are not very predictive of who will actual purchase. However, these data
can be used for a test, followed by a predictive model used to forecast which
customers on the list are most likely to respond (see Sect. 20.5.5.2).
</p>
<p>20.5.5.1 Profiling
</p>
<p>A very common method advocated by some direct marketers (Hughes 2000)
is to profile the firm&rsquo;s existing customer base and then target customers based
on the characteristics of current customers. The typical process is:
</p>
<p>1. Take a sample of current customers,
2. Obtain and append to the customer record relevant demographic or cus-
</p>
<p>tomer characteristic information about these customers,
3. Cross-tab or use clustering of demographics to describe or &ldquo;profile&rdquo; current
</p>
<p>customers in terms of these characteristics,
4. Target customers with identical or similar profiles as the current customers.
</p>
<p>There are two major issues in profiling analysis. First, how do we prioritize
the variables that make up the profile? For example, the current customer
profile might be older men. Which would be a more likely customer &ndash; a
younger man or an older woman? Second, the firm only targets customers
similar to its current customers, but these customers were acquired using
previous targeting methods and advertising vehicles and so their profile was
created by the process that acquired them. As a result, profiling may miss
customers in other segments who would purchase if given the opportunity.
</p>
<p>One solution to the first problem is to use techniques such as discriminant
analysis, logistic regression, or decision trees. To do this, the firm must have</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.5 Developing a Customer Acquisition Program 511
</p>
<p>a large list that includes non-customers. Logistic regression or discriminant
analysis provide an equation that can be used to weight the several variables
used in the profiling and derive a probability that the non-customer belongs in
the customer group (see Chapter 15 on discrete dependent variable models).
Alternatively, a decision tree method such as CHAID can be used to derive
a tree-like structure showing the key variables that distinguish customers
from non-customers (see Chapter 17). The end-nodes of the tree represent a
particular customer profile, and calculate the probability the customers with
this profile are current customers.
</p>
<p>The second problem &ndash; the &ldquo;self fulfilling prophecy&rdquo; of targeting only in-
dividuals who are similar to current customers &ndash; is difficult to address. By
targeting prospects with similar profiles, the firm never learns if it can attract
other types of customers. To overcome this problem, firms should use random
samples drawn from lists to see if those who respond have the same charac-
teristics as current customers. If not, it opens the opportunity of adding new
segments. However, the method requires more rigor than is generally applied
to the problem. One must be careful because random responses that are not
statistically reliable will cause the firm to target new segments that in fact
do not prove fruitful.
</p>
<p>20.5.5.2 Regression and Logistic Regression Modeling
</p>
<p>Some firms find sources of names, often through list brokers, and then send
a marketing communication including an offer to a random sample of these
names. The names are appended with characteristics such as demographics.
Then to identify responders the firm runs a regression or a logistic regression
model (more appropriate) in which the dependent variable is buy or no-buy.
The independent variables come from the characteristics appended to the
database. The regression and logistic regression models can be stated as:
</p>
<p>yi = Xiβ + εi (20.3a)
</p>
<p>pi =
1
</p>
<p>1 + e&minus;Xiβ
(20.3b)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>yi = 1 if a given prospect i purchases, otherwise it is 0
Xi = the explanatory variables used to characterize the prospect
pi = the probability that prospect i purchases
εi = the error term
β = the coefficient weights for the explanatory variables
</p>
<p>While in principle this type of approach sounds promising, its success hinges
on the predictive power or &ldquo;lift&rdquo; provided by these models (see Chapter 10).
While this approach can work in practice, its success is not guaranteed. The</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>512 20 Acquiring Customers
</p>
<p>basic problem is that the explanatory variables available are typically demo-
graphic characteristics. Previously collected behavioral characteristics typ-
ically provide the most predictive power, but since we are attracting new
customers, there are no data on previous behavior, at least with the acquir-
ing firm.
</p>
<p>20.5.5.3 Testing Several Lists
</p>
<p>A very common acquisition method is to take a set of lists and then randomly
mail to a subset of individuals on each list. Each list is then scored based on
its response rate. Those lists that score above a specific cut-off are mailed
in larger quantities. This method is as old as the direct marketing industry.
The problem is that it has flaws. The main one is that unless the sample size
is quite large, the test may not have the statistical power to identify truly
profitable lists.
</p>
<p>To demonstrate the problem, we have created 20 lists, each with a prob-
ability of response of 2%. A sample size of 5,000 per list is mailed and the
response rates calculated. The firm has a cut-off of 2.3% as its breakeven
point. Table 20.4 shows the results. It shows three lists are above the cutoff
value.
</p>
<p>Using a normal approximation to the binomial distribution with n = 5, 000
and p = 0.02, the probability that at least 2 lists will be above the cutoff is
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>20.5 Developing a Customer Acquisition Program 513
</p>
<p>13.7%. The probability that at least one list will be above the cutoff is 37.6%.
This is in spite of the fact that the cutoff is 2.3%. The problem is that the
sample size of 5,000 does not provide enough precision in the estimate of the
response rate to effectively discriminate between a 2% and a 2.3% response
rate. In testing several lists, this problem multiplies, i.e., the 13.7% and 37.6%
probabilities will become even higher the greater the number of lists that are
tested. The 13.7% and 37.6% probabilities can easily be computed but most
firms select lists to mail to that are above their cutoff. The implication is that
if a firm does list testing, it is likely that some of the lists will be assumed to
be better targeting vehicles than they actually are.
</p>
<p>Therefore, some method or statistical model is needed to improve the firm&rsquo;s
ability to test lists that adjusts for the fact that at random some lists are
likely to be above the cutoff value, and this is more likely the more lists that
are tested. Using classical statistical methods without adjusting for multiple
list testing leads to a reasonable chance that rollouts of test lists above the
cut-off will attenuate to the mean of all lists when re-tested or rolled out.
One way to make the adjustment would be to require high levels of statistical
confidence before concluding a particular list is profitable. This can be related
to the number of lists tested using methods of multiple comparison (e.g., see
classical statistics texts such as Lapin 1990).
</p>
<p>Pfeifer (1998) proposes a Bayesian approach to deriving the optimal sample
size to use for a test mailing. The approach takes into account the manager&rsquo;s
&ldquo;prior&rdquo; expectation of the response rate, as well as the expected profits per
response. Chapter 9 discusses the approach in detail.
</p>
<p>20.5.5.4 Two-Step Acquisition Methods
</p>
<p>The term two-step refers to the use of &ldquo;self-selection&rdquo; of prospective cus-
tomers who respond to an initial, non-purchase communication and then
receive a second communication which is an offer to purchase. This method
is used because of the lack of precision in being able to identify prospective
buyers using some of the methods discussed earlier in this chapter.
</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, one often sees continuing education sem-
inar series being offered in the Wall Street Journal or other publications
(e.g., The Economist). The individual course is offered and is functioning
as a lead product (Sect. 20.4.4), but when the individual responds to the
seminar advertisement, he or she is also put on a mailing list. Then, fu-
ture seminars are offered to the respondent through a catalog that can be
mailed to the individual. The response rate from catalogs sent to first-step
respondents is much higher than it would be if it were sent to the population
at-large.
</p>
<p>Catalog companies often use this method because of the high cost of send-
ing catalogs through the mail. They advertise in relevant publications such
as House and Garden to target a specific type of demographic or lifestyle</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>514 20 Acquiring Customers
</p>
<p>segment group (e.g., women interested in gardening) and then those that re-
spond are mailed a catalog. As importantly, they are kept on the mailing list
so that even if they do not respond to the first catalog, they can be considered
prospects for future mailings.
</p>
<p>Two-step acquisition methods depend upon: (1) the cost structure of reach-
ing specific audiences, and (2) the nature of the targeting. For example, it is
very difficult to target on the basis of lifestyle even though firms recognize
that it is important because lists rarely contain true lifestyle data. Therefore,
using publications aimed at specific lifestyles (called &ldquo;vertical publications&rdquo;)
may be far more effective. Even when a publication sells its subscription list,
it may be more cost effective to use a two-step acquisition method because
of the lower cost of a mass advertisement to identify prospects.
</p>
<p>20.6 Research Issues in Acquisition Marketing
</p>
<p>In general, there is very little research on acquisition marketing. The tra-
ditional marketing literature does not separate the issue of acquiring cus-
tomers from retaining customers. Positioning, segmentation, targeting is a
generic concept. Research in advertising studies the general impact of com-
munications but does not separate newly acquired customers from retained
customers. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new literature on the the-
ory of customer acquisition. No doubt some of the existing studies can be
modified to fit the issue of customer acquisition.
</p>
<p>Important research questions that affect managerial practice are: (1) How
do initial product/service expectations affect retention rates? (2) What the-
ories can be used to predict the likely impact of expectations on retention
rates? (3) How does the introductory price affect customer reference prices
for future purchases? (4) What variables determine the shape and steepness
of the acquisition response curve? (5) How does traditional advertising affect
acquisition rates? (6) How is media advertising apportioned between acquisi-
tion and retention impact? (7) How do customers develop initial expectations
about a product/service they have not purchased? (8) How does self-selection
in acquisition targeting affect retention rates? (9) How does advertising fre-
quency affect acquisition rates? (10) Can acquisition marketing techniques be
used to create a brand image? (11) Can basic principles (or theories) of ac-
quisition marketing be developed which help practitioners design acquisition
programs?
</p>
<p>No doubt there are many other issues that can be added to our list. How-
ever, as important as acquisition marketing is, researchers need to develop
theories, principles and empirical generalizations that will help practitioners
develop better acquisition marketing strategies and tactics.</p>

<p>Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
</p>
<p>Abstract Cross-selling and up-selling are fundamental database marketing
activities for developing customers; that is, increasing customer expenditures
with the firm. Cross-selling entails selling products in the firm&rsquo;s product line
that the customer does not currently own. Up-selling entails selling &ldquo;more&rdquo;
(higher volume, upgrades) of products they already are buying from the com-
pany. This chapter focuses on database marketing models for cross-selling and
up-selling. Included are next-product-to-buy models, which predict which
product the customer is likely to purchase next, and extensions using hazard
models that predict when the customer will buy. We cover data envelope and
stochastic frontier models for up-selling. We conclude with a framework for
managing an on-going cross-selling effort.
</p>
<p>21.1 The Strategy
</p>
<p>Cross-selling and up-selling are important strategies for increasing revenues
among current customers. Cross-selling is when the firm sells different prod-
ucts to its customers. For example, the customer uses Intuit&rsquo;s TurboTax
software and the company tries to sell the customer Quicken. Up-selling is
when the firm sells more of the same product to the customer. For example,
a customer has $300,000 in term life insurance, and the company tries to sell
the customer a $500,000 policy (Kim and Kim 2001).
</p>
<p>There are three potential benefits of cross/up-selling, illustrated by the
simple retention model of lifetime value:
</p>
<p>LTV =
&infin;&sum;
t=1
</p>
<p>mtr
t&minus;1
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)t&minus;1
(21.1)
</p>
<p>where mt is the customer&rsquo;s profit contribution in period t, r is retention rate,
and δ is discount rate. First, cross-selling can generate higher sales in the
current period (m1 is increased because this month, in addition to the normal

<p>monthly charge, the customer also has purchased a new phone). Second cross-
selling can increase future revenue (higher mt for t &gt; 1). For example, a
cell-phone company may cross-sell a feature, e.g., caller ID, which generates
revenues in future periods because it is an additional monthly charge. Third
and less obvious, cross-selling might increase retention rate (r).
</p>
<p>Figure 21.1 shows why cross-selling might increase retention. Cross-selling
results in the customer owning more of the company&rsquo;s products. The more
products a customer owns, the better the customer can be serviced. This
increases customer satisfaction and in turn, retention. In addition, the in-
creased customer satisfaction encourages the customer to buy more products
from the firm, reinforcing this cycle. Second, the more products the customer
owns, the higher the customer&rsquo;s switching cost and this increases retention.
For example, a customer who has checking, IRAs, CDs, and a mortgage with
a bank incurs a large cost to switch even part of his or her business to a new
bank, certainly compared to the customer who only has a checking account.
</p>
<p>Kamakura et al. (2003) find a positive association between the number of
products owned by the customer and their longevity with the firm. Of course
causality may be mutual, but the association is as predicted. Kamakura et al.
(2003) also provide evidence for the services-satisfaction-retention link in fi-
nancial services. Recent studies reach different conclusions as to whether num-
ber of products owned enhances retention. Balachander and Ghosh (2006)
and Van den Poel and Larivière (2004) find that cross-buying (owning more
products) is associated with lower customer churn. Reinartz et al. (2005)
find that cross-buying is associated with longer customer duration. However,
Reinartz et al. (2006) use Granger causality tests to infer that cross-buying
is caused by customer loyalty, rather than the reverse.
</p>
<p>21.2 Cross-Selling Models
</p>
<p>The key question is what products should the firm cross-sell to which cus-
tomers at what time? Three types of predictive models have been developed to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.2 Cross-Selling Models 517
</p>
<p>aid in this task: (1) Models that focus on what product the customer is likely
to buy next (&ldquo;next-product-to-buy&rdquo; models). (2) Models that also consider
when the product is likely to be bought. (3) Models that also consider how
likely the customer is to respond to the cross-selling offer. The first two types
infer what product the customer needs. The third type focuses on whether
the customer will respond to cross-selling marketing efforts (Bodapati 2008).
For example, a current iPod owner may &ldquo;need&rdquo; a car adaptor. However, the
customer may not respond to a cross-selling offer.
</p>
<p>21.2.1 Next-Product-to-Buy Models
</p>
<p>The strategy behind next-product-to-buy models is to predict the product the
customer is most likely to buy next, then cross-sell that product. However,
if we predict the customer is going to buy this product next, why do we
need to cross-sell it? The sale will happen naturally! The next-product-to-
buy approach implicitly views this as a data problem. It would be ideal to
survey Customer A and ask what product he or she needs. Since we do not
have that data, we look at what products customers with similar profiles
(current product ownership, personal characteristics) have bought next, and
assume that is what Customer A needs (see Knott et al. 2002 for further
discussion).
</p>
<p>21.2.1.1 Market Basket Analysis and Collaborative
Filtering Models
</p>
<p>Market basket analysis and collaborative filtering are discussed in Chapters 13
and 14. These are the most basic cross-selling methods. Market basket analy-
sis, in its simplest form, calculates Prob(Buy Product A | Bought Product
B) across all &ldquo;market baskets.&rdquo; This yields a large matrix where the ABth
entry is Prob(Buy Product B | Bought Product A). P(B|A) is called &ldquo;confi-
dence.&rdquo; To apply this to cross-selling, one would isolate all the customers who
bought Product A last, find the product B for which Prob(B|A) is maximal,
and cross-sell that product to those customers.
</p>
<p>There are several issues with using market basket analysis for cross-selling.
First, is confidence, P(B|A), the right criterion? Consider the case that
P(iPod Car Adaptor|iPod) = 0.2, and P(Video Game|iPod) = 0.4. On the
basis of confidence, we would cross-sell the iPod buyer a video game. How-
ever, it may be that buying an iPod Car Adaptor is relatively uncommon,
whereas buying a video game is quite common. That is, the unconditional
probability, P(iPod Car Adaptor) = 0.1, while P(Buy Video Game) = 0.7.
This means the &ldquo;lift&rdquo; is higher for the iPod Car Adaptor than for the video
game (0.2/0.1 = 2 to 1, vs. 0.4/0.8 = 0.5 to 1). That is, customers are twice</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>518 21 Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
</p>
<p>as likely to buy an iPod Car Adaptor if they&rsquo;ve bought an iPod, compared
to the average customer. Although the video game is the most likely product
the customer will buy next, the argument in favor of the adaptor is that if we
want to sell iPod adapters, we need to cross-sell it to iPod owners, because
these are the only people who will buy the adapter.
</p>
<p>A second issue is the time period over which to construct the P(B|A)
matrix. That is, during what period do we calculate P(B|A)? Often P(B|A)
is calculated based on data from a given store visit. However, if the cross-
selling effort will take place after the current store visit, this may not be the
correct calculation. What the customer buys in the same store visit, given he
or she purchased product A, is not the same as what the customer might by
say on the next store visit. The time period for calculating P(B|A) should
logically match up to the timing of the cross-selling effort.
</p>
<p>A third issue is how many products to consider. Companies can have thou-
sands and thousands of &ldquo;SKU&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and to require the calculation of P(B|A) for
each of them may result in very low sample sizes (low &ldquo;support,&rdquo; see Chap-
ter 13). Companies may have to aggregate across SKU&rsquo;s. For example, an iPod
accessory such as an iPod Cover may come in 25 varieties. The firm may think
of &ldquo;iPod Cover&rdquo; as one product. However, this begs the question of which
particular cover should be shown on the direct mail piece that targets the
customers who are deemed likely to need a cover. Obviously, judgments have
to be made when not every single SKU can be included in the P(B|A) matrix.
</p>
<p>Collaborative filtering is a &ldquo;step up&rdquo; from market basket analysis because
it takes into account multiple antecedent products in a systematic way.1 As
discussed in Chapter 14, there are two types of collaborative filtering &ldquo;en-
gines,&rdquo; user-based and item-based. User-based systems find customers who
have similar &ldquo;tastes&rdquo; as the target customer, and see whether these customers
like the focal product. If so, that product is recommended to the target cus-
tomer. Item-based systems start with the set of products the target customer
has already bought. They then correlate, across all customers, the relation-
ship between liking those products and liking the focal product. These corre-
lations are then aggregated. The product most highly correlated with the set
of products the customer has already bought is the one that is recommended.
</p>
<p>Collaborative filtering has been the subject of much research (see Ado-
mavicius 2005; Ansari et al. 2000). The emphasis of this research is on pre-
dicting preferences. We are not aware of assessments of these models in a
field test to determine whether the customer bought the recommended prod-
uct. Also, much of the collaborative filtering literature has assumed the data
available are product ratings (see Mild and Reutterer 2003 for an exception).
It is less clear how things should be handled if the data available are product
purchases. These can be 0&ndash;1 coded and measures of association can be cal-
culated, but the problem is how to interpret 0: 0 could mean the customer
has considered the product and doesn&rsquo;t want it, or has never considered the
</p>
<p>1 Market basket analyses can calculate P(A|BC), but data sparseness puts a limit on how
many of these probabilities can be calculated.</p>

</p>
<p>product. We will later discuss an approach by Bodapati (2008) for addressing
this issue.
</p>
<p>21.2.1.2 Structural Next-Product-to-Buy Models
</p>
<p>Several next-product-to-buy models use a structural approach to predict
which product the customer will buy next. Structural means we assume an
underlying utility structure for the consumer, and the consumer is trying
to maximize utility. These models focus on the impact of previous product
ownership on next-product-to-buy.
</p>
<p>A Latent Trait Model of Product Ownership: Kamakura et al. (1991) define
each customer by his or her financial &ldquo;maturity,&rdquo; related to the customer&rsquo;s
financial goals and demographics. Products are &ldquo;positioned&rdquo; along this finan-
cial maturity dimension; a product is less likely to be owned if it is positioned
higher in financial maturity. These ideas are operationalized in a latent trait
model (see also Bawa and Srinivasan 1997):
</p>
<p>Pij =
1{
</p>
<p>1 + e[ai(bi&minus;Oj)]
} (21.2)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Pij = Probability customer j owns product i.
Oj = Financial maturity of customer j.
bi = Positioning of product i on financial maturity dimension.
ai = Slope parameter for product i.
</p>
<p>The probability of owning any product increases as a function of the cus-
tomer&rsquo;s financial maturity. However, ownership probability changes most
quickly for the product whose positioning bi equals the customer&rsquo;s maturity
Oj . The slope parameter ai regulates how strong that change is.
</p>
<p>Kamakura et al. suggest cross-selling customers the product that they have
a high chance of owning but do not yet own. For example, checking accounts
have a small bi parameter. If a particular customer has a fairly high maturity,
then Oi &gt; bj and the customer will have a high probability of owning a
checking account. If he or she does not own it, it should be cross-sold.
</p>
<p>Kamakura et al. estimate their model on 3,034 households, for 18 finan-
cial service products. Table 21.1 shows the hypothesized ordering of products
and categories according to financial maturity, and the corresponding esti-
mated bi&rsquo;s. The correspondence is excellent. It suggests that there is a logical
sequence by which customers purchase products as their financial maturity
grows, since only customers with high financial maturity tend to own the
high bi products.
</p>
<p>Kamakura et al. apply their procedure to a bank that recently added sev-
eral products to its portfolio. The goal is to find which of these products to
target to which customers. Kamakura et al. first predict customer financial</p>

<p>21.2 Cross-Selling Models 521
</p>
<p>So for example, Customers 1 and 2 would be the best prospects for Insurance
and Stocks, because they have the financial maturity consistent with owning
this product.
</p>
<p>Kamakura et al. pioneered the notion that there is a logical sequence of
products that customers buy, and if we can model that sequence, we can
target appropriately. However, as noted by the authors, the model has only
one dimension, financial maturity. Estimated financial maturity will inher-
ently be large for customers who own a lot of products. Thus the model will
naturally try to target new products to customers who own a lot of prod-
ucts. Second, while the notion of purchase sequence is temporal, the model is
estimated on cross-sectional data. We now examine time series models that
predict next-purchase-to-buy.
</p>
<p>Simple Time Series Models of Product Purchase
</p>
<p>Knott et al. (2002) discuss simple models for predicting next-product-to-buy.
They use data consisting of all customers who purchased a product in time t.2
</p>
<p>The product they bought becomes the dependent variable; product ownership
and household variables as of time t &minus; 1 are the predictors. The model is of
the form:
</p>
<p>PROB ijt = fj(OWNERSHIP ij,t&minus;1,HHCHARi) + εijt (21.3)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>PROB ijt = Probability customer i purchases product j in time t.
OWNERSHIP ij,t&minus;1 = 0&ndash;1 indicator of whether customer i owned product j
</p>
<p>as of time t &minus; 1.
HHCHARi = Demographics or RFM measures for customer i.
εijt = Unobserved factors that induce customer i to purchase product j in
</p>
<p>time t (the &ldquo;error term&rdquo;).
fj = Product-specific function that maps ownership and household charac-
</p>
<p>teristics into probability of purchase in time t.
</p>
<p>The model can be estimated using neural networks, discriminant analysis,
multinomial logit, or logistic regression. The logistic regression model is the
simplest, as follows:
</p>
<p>PROB ijt =
1
</p>
<p>1 + e
&minus;
(
β0j+
</p>
<p>K&sum;

This procedure is extremely simple to implement. For each customer, we
know whether the product they bought in time t was product j or not &ndash; that
defines the dependent variable for the product j logistic regression. We have
the customer&rsquo;s current product ownership and household characteristics as of
time t&minus;1. These define the independent variables. Time is typically measured
on a monthly basis, so t might be October of 2002, and t&minus; 1 would be from
September, 2002, back in time.
</p>
<p>The product affinities, akj , shed light on the purchase sequence. Insight
on this sequence is best obtained by calculating the odds ratio:
</p>
<p>ODDSRATIOjk = eakj (21.5)
</p>
<p>For example, an odds ratio of 1.5 means that owning product k increases
the odds of next purchasing product j by 50%. An odds ratio of 0.75 would
mean that owning product k decreases the odds of next purchasing product
j by 25%. Table 21.2 shows odds ratios for five financial products. The table
reveals that most of the products are &ldquo;self-reinforcing,&rdquo; i.e., owning it is the
most powerful predictor of whether the customer will purchase it again. The
effect is particularly strong with CDs.
</p>
<p>Knott et al. investigate how various factors affect the accuracy of their
model, measured as the percentage of times that the actual next product
bought was either the first or second most likely product predicted by the
model. The average accuracy across all manipulations was 49.9%. They com-
pare statistical methods as well as the types of independent variables in-
cluded in the model. They also consider whether the estimation sample rep-
resents the actual percentages of products bought (random sample), or en-
sures under-purchased products have relatively more observations (stratified
sample; see discussion of choice-based sampling in Chapter 10).
</p>
<p>A regression of predictive accuracy as a function of these factors is shown in
Table 21.3. Perhaps the most striking finding in Table 21.3 is that data avail-
ability is at least as important as statistical method, particularly in the case</p>

<p>of product ownership variables. Including product ownership in the model
increases predictive accuracy by 5.76 percentage points, whereas neural nets
increase predictive accuracy by 1.07 percentage points over the worst statis-
tical method, discriminant analysis. This reinforces previous that previous
behavior is the best predictor of future behavior (Rossi et al. 1996), and sug-
gests product ownership data provide the firm with a competitive advantage.
It is also interesting that random sampling outperforms stratified sampling.
This may be because stratification gets the base purchase rate wrong, so is
not at determining the most likely product the customer is to buy next.
</p>
<p>Knott et al. field test their approach with a retail bank that wished to
increase sales of one of its loan products. Management had used a heuristic
based on customer wealth to target customers in the past, but was willing to
test an NPTB model. The model was estimated on 7,200 customers using a
neural net. Nine products were considered, including the loan product. Pre-
dictor variables included current product ownership and customer variables
such as total deposit and loan dollars, age, length in residence, income, and
home ownership. Experimental groups were:
</p>
<p>&bull; NPTB Mail Group: Customers selected using the NPTB model. A cus-
tomer was selected if the model predicted that the loan would be their
first- or second-most likely next product to buy. This yielded 23,877 cus-
tomers who were sent an offer for the loan (n = 23,877).
</p>
<p>&bull; NPTB Control Group: Customers selected using the model as described
above, but not mailed an offer (n = 1,209).
</p>
<p>&bull; Heuristic Mail Group: Customers selected using managerial judgment
based on wealth of the customer, and sent an offer for the loan (n =
23,639).</p>

bank, and sent an offer for the loan (n = 49,905).
</p>
<p>&bull; Prospect Control Group: Prospective customers obtained from the list bro-
ker who were not sent an offer for the loan (n = 2,500).
</p>
<p>Comparing the NPTB Mail Group to its control determines whether the
loan offer generates incremental sales. That this effect will be positive is not
a foregone conclusion. Customers could still obtain the loan directly from the
bank, even if they were not mailed the offer. The same comparison is relevant
between the Heuristic Mail Group and its control. The incremental sales for
the NPTB and the Heuristic can then be compared to see which is superior.
Both of these can then be compared to the Prospect Group. The results are
shown in Table 21.4,3 and suggest the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; NPTB vs. Its Control : The offer generates increases of 0.63%(1.13&minus;0.50%)
in purchase rate and $774 ($8,249&ndash;7,475) in revenue per purchaser. This
yields a total gain of $56.18 in revenues per targeted customer. Targeting
an offer to customers based on the NPTB model generates incremental
sales compared to what would have been obtained had these customers
not been targeted.
</p>
<p>&bull; Heuristic vs. Its Control : The offer generates increases of 0.02% (0.44&ndash;
0.42%) in purchase rate and $1,466 ($6,735&ndash;5,269) in revenue per pur-
chaser. This results in a total gain of $7.42 in revenues per tar-
geted customer. Mailing to customers selected by the heuristic generates
incremental revenues, but most comes from higher revenues given pur-
chase, rather than a higher purchase rate.
</p>
<p>&bull; NPTB vs. Heuristic: The NPTB model outperforms the heuristic model
in terms of incremental revenues per targeted customer ($56.18 vs. $7.42).
The better performance of the NPTB model comes from incremental re-
sponse (0.63% vs. 0.02% for the heuristic) rather than revenues per pur-
chaser (gain of $774 vs. $1,466 for the heuristic).

</p>
<p>&bull; Prospect Group: As expected, none of the customers in the prospect control
group obtained a loan. The purchase rate in the prospect mail group was
0.10%, with revenues per responder of $7,453. These are pure incremental
sales, because no one from this group would have responded without the
direct mail solicitation. The prospect mailing generated $7.32 incremental
sales per targeted customer.
</p>
<p>&bull; NPTB vs. Prospect : The NPTB outperforms prospecting since it gener-
ates $56.18 incremental per targeted customer while the prospect mailing
generates an additional $7.32 per targeted customer.
</p>
<p>&bull; Heuristic vs. Prospect : The heuristic performs about the same as prospect-
ing, generating incremental sales of $7.42 per targeted customer, compared
to $7.32 per targeted customer from the prospecting.
</p>
<p>Table 21.5 shows profit and ROI of the different methods.4 The first column
shows incremental lift generated by the method, relative to its control group.
The second column calculates gross profit contribution, assuming 272 basis
points (0.0272) profit contribution per incremental lift. The third column
shows mail cost/mailee. For NPTB and heuristic, this is simply the cost of
mailing and printing. For prospects, this also includes list rental. Total mail
costs are then calculated by multiplying the per-mailee cost times the total
number mailed in Table 21.4. Subtracting this from gross profit contribution
yields total profit; ROI is calculated by dividing profit by cost.
</p>
<p>Table 21.5 shows that the NPTB model is the only method that pays out,
with an ROI of 530.1%. The other two methods lose money. In defense of the
prospecting approach, arguably these customers would generate additional
revenues in the future. However, there could be some long-term benefits in
terms of lifetime value for the NPTB and heuristic customers as well (e.g.,
higher retention).
</p>
<p>Knott et al.&rsquo;s approach is simple and easy to implement. However, the
model could be improved. It focuses on what product the customer will

</p>
<p>purchase next, given that they will purchase. However, many customers will
not purchase anything in the next month or two. We want to target the
customer who is more likely to be in the market for a financial product in
the next month. An ideal model would include purchase timing. In addition,
the independent logistic models ignore cross-equation correlations and their
probabilities do not sum to one across equations. Finally, the approach does
not consider customer heterogeneity in its various parameters.
</p>
<p>A Hierarchical Bayes Next-Product-to-Buy Model
</p>
<p>Li et al. (2005) build on Kamakura et al. (1991) and Knott et al. (2002).
They model financial maturity (which they call &ldquo;demand maturity&rdquo;) and
previous product ownership. Li et al. apply their model to financial services,
in particular, a retail bank. The model is:
</p>
<p>Uijt = βi |Oj &minus;DMi,t&minus;1|+ γ1ijCOMPET ij + γ2ijOVERSAT i
+γ3ijSWIT it + εijt (21.6)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Uijt = Utility of customer i for product j at time t.
Oj = Position of product j along the demand maturity continuum.
DMi,t&minus;1 = The demand maturity of customer i at the end of period t&minus; 1.
COMPET ij = 1 if customer i has opened an account in the product category
</p>
<p>of product j with another bank within the last 6 months.
OVERSAT i = Customer i&rsquo;s overall satisfaction with the bank as measured
</p>
<p>in a customer satisfaction survey.
SWIT it = Customer i&rsquo;s &ldquo;switching costs&rdquo; at time t, equalling 1 if the cus-
</p>
<p>tomer is a white collar worker, the household as at least one child, and the
household owns more than the average number of accounts with the bank.
</p>
<p>εijt = Unobserved factors influencing utility for product j at time t.
</p>
<p>The model is a multivariate probit. The customer can choose any, all, or
none of the J products each period. Since it is possible that the customer
chooses no products in a given period, it incorporates purchase timing. Model
parameters are heterogeneous across customers and for COMPET, OVER-
SAT, and SWIT, also specific to the product. Heterogeneity is modeled as a
function of customer demographics. The error terms are allowed to correlate
across equations. This captures &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; (Manchanda et al. 1999). The
term |Oj &minus;DMi,t&minus;1| captures the distance between the financial maturity of
the customer and the positioning of the product along the demand maturity
continuum. The Oj are product-specific constants to be estimated. Demand
maturity term is modeled as:
</p>
<p>DMi,t&minus;1 =
J&sum;
</p>
<p>j=1
</p>
<p>[OjDij,t&minus;1 (λ1ACCTNBRij,t&minus;1 + λ2BALij,t&minus;1
</p>
<p>+λ3HOLDINGij,t&minus;1)] (21.7)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.2 Cross-Selling Models 527
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>Dij,t&minus;1 = 1 if customer i purchased product j in period t&minus; 1.
ACCTNBRij,t&minus;1 = Cumulative number of product j accounts purchased by
</p>
<p>customer i up to period t&minus; 1.
BALij,t&minus;1 = Average monthly balance in product j accounts by customer i
</p>
<p>up to period t&minus; 1.
HOLDING ij,t&minus;1 = Elapsed time since first opening of an account of type j,
</p>
<p>for customer i, up to period t&minus; 1.
Assuming the λ&rsquo;s are positive, Equation 21.7 infers higher demand maturity
for the customer who has bought a lot of products that are positioned high
on the demand maturity continuum. The estimated model generates several
important findings:
</p>
<p>&bull; The financial maturity parameter (βi) is on average negative, meaning that
the further away the product is from the customer&rsquo;s financial maturity, the
less likely he or she is to purchase it.
</p>
<p>&bull; The financial maturity measure (Oj) orders financial products from low
to high maturity as follows: checking, savings, debit card, credit card,
installment loan, CD, money market account, brokerage account. This
ordering has face validity and is consistent with Kamakura et al. (1991).
</p>
<p>&bull; Having recently bought a similar product in a competing bank (COM-
PET = 1) decreases likelihood of purchasing the product in the focal
bank.
</p>
<p>&bull; Higher customer satisfaction (OVERSAT ) makes it more likely the cus-
tomer will purchase additional products from the bank.
</p>
<p>&bull; Higher switching costs (as measured by the SWIT variable) are associ-
ated with higher likelihoods of purchasing additional products from the
bank.
</p>
<p>Li et al. (2005) show their model out-predicts a simple model of indepen-
dent probits. It is a clear advance in structural models of next product
to buy.
</p>
<p>A Factor Analytic Model Combining Survey and Internal Record Data
</p>
<p>Li et al.&rsquo;s results suggest that ownership of products at competitive banks
influences their likelihood of purchasing from the focal bank. Data on cus-
tomers&rsquo; product ownership at competitors are generally not available. A sur-
vey can be implemented for a random selection of customers, but a method is
then needed to infer, for all the bank&rsquo;s customers, their likelihood of owning
the product at a competitive bank.
</p>
<p>Kamakura et al. (2003) propose a factor analysis model for this purpose,
as follows:
</p>
<p>E[Yn|Xn] = h(λ&prime; +XnΛ&prime;) (21.8)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>528 21 Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Yn = Vector of ownership variables for customer n. There are J products.
For some customers, all product variables are observed via internal records
or survey. For most customers, only the variables obtainable via internal
records are observed.
</p>
<p>Xn = Vector of P factor scores for customer n. P is less than J , consistent
with the notion of reducing the dimensionality of the data.
</p>
<p>Λ&prime; = J&times;P matrix of factor loadings, each element representing the correlation
between factor p and ownership variable j.
</p>
<p>λ&prime; = J &times; 1 Vector of constant terms.
h(&bull;) = Function that relates factor scores to each product ownership variable.
The key output of the estimation process are the factor loadings, Λ&prime;, which
can be graphed for interpretation. However, the model can also be used
to generate the factor scores,Xn, for each customer, and hence the prob-
ability distribution for ownership variables Yn, whether they are observed
or not.
</p>
<p>The authors apply their model to a commercial bank located in Brazil.
They have internal and survey data available for 5,500 customers. The inter-
nal data include product ownership at the focal bank, transaction volume,
and demographics. The survey data contain product ownership at competi-
tive banks. They estimate the model on 1,387 customers, and use it to predict
competitive ownership for the remaining 4,163 customers. They can evaluate
their model on these customers since they know the actual competitive data
for these customers.
</p>
<p>Figure 21.2 illustrates plots of factor loadings. The figure is not the au-
thors&rsquo; exact results but is illustrative. Looking first at the focal-bank load-
ings, car insurance and life insurance both load low on dimension 1 and high
on dimension 2. Because they have similar loadings, this means that own-
ership is driven by a similar process. Customers, if they own one of these
products, should own the other. If they don&rsquo;t, e.g., if a customer owns car
insurance with the bank but not life insurance, he or she would be a good
candidate for a cross-sell. Interestingly, credit card ownership at competi-
tive banks has similar loadings as credit card ownership at the focal bank.
This means that customer ownership of credit cards is correlated across
banks. However, insurance ownership at the focal bank has different load-
ings than insurance ownership at the competitive bank. This means that if
the customer does not have car insurance at the focal bank, he or she prob-
ably has it with a competitive bank, and would not be a good cross-sell
prospect.
</p>
<p>The authors use their model to predict competitive product ownership
for the 4,163 holdout customers. The prediction results are quite good. The
top decile predicted by the model accounts for a median of 35% of all the
customers who own the product at a competitive bank. The performance of
the model is thus very promising.</p>

<p>21.2.2 Next-Product-to-Buy Models with Explicit
Consideration of Purchase Timing
</p>
<p>21.2.2.1 Hazard Models
</p>
<p>Hazard models predict the next (or first) time an event will occur for a cus-
tomer. To apply this to cross-selling, a hazard model can be used to calculate
how soon each customer is likely to buy each product. Then we might cross-
sell the product that is predicted to be the soonest next-product-to-buy for
each customer.
</p>
<p>There are many forms of hazard models. Perhaps the most common is the
Cox proportional hazards model (see Cox 1972 and Chapter 15). The basic</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>530 21 Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
</p>
<p>model is:
H(t) = H0(t)eβX (21.9)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>H(t) = The instantaneous probability the customer will purchase at time t,
given it has been t time periods since the last purchase.
</p>
<p>H0(t) = The &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; hazard, that portion ofH(t) due solely to the passage
of time since the last purchase.
</p>
<p>X = A vector of predictors (&ldquo;covariates&rdquo;) for the customer, which could
include ownership and household variables.
</p>
<p>Hazard models differ in the functional form used for the baseline hazard
(e.g., exponential) and in the covariates included for the customer. Given the
hazard function, one can calculate the &ldquo;survivor&rdquo; function, S(t), which is the
probability the customer has not purchased by time t.
</p>
<p>Harrison and Ansell (2002) apply a hazard model to predict when cus-
tomers are likely to buy another insurance product. They estimate their
model on 9,000 randomly selected customers. The &ldquo;dependent variable&rdquo; is the
time between the previous purchase of any insurance product and the sub-
sequent purchase of any insurance product. The covariates included marital
status, age, gender, and categories derived from ACORN financial clusters
(Chapter 8): financially sophisticated, financially involved, financially mod-
erate, or financially inactive. The results were that married and separated
customers had higher hazards than single, divorced, or widowed, and older
males had higher hazards. As expected, financially sophisticated customers
had the highest hazards, followed by financially involved, moderate, and in-
active.
</p>
<p>One way to apply the results is to score customers in terms of their hazard
rates, and cross-sell to those with the highest hazard. However, this may
depend on customer heterogeneity in hazard rates (see Jain and Vilcassim
1991). Consider Fig. 21.3. Customer A is likely to purchase sooner, so may be
a good target. Customer B&rsquo;s hazard rate is highest in weeks 17&ndash;23. But what
if the cross-selling campaign is scheduled for weeks 17&ndash;23? Should we target
Customer B? Figure 21.3 would suggest &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but unfortunately the situation
is a bit more complicated. It is possible that Customer A will purchase in
weeks 3&ndash;7 and then return to the market by weeks 17&ndash;23. The hazard rate
just depicts the likelihood of when the next purchase will occur. The question
is whether Customer A will be in the market in weeks 17&ndash;23. This requires a
more detailed calculation, conditioning on the number of purchases and the
timing of them for a given customer. How to do this is an important area for
future research.
</p>
<p>Knott et al. (2002) integrate a hazard timing model with their next-
product-to-buy model. They define the following events:
</p>
<p>A = The customer buys some banking product in the next 3 months.
B = The customer will buy the focal product when he or she next buys.</p>

</p>
<p>They then calculate:
</p>
<p>Prob(A and B) = Prob(A)Prob(B|A) (21.10)
The authors&rsquo; original approach was to estimate Prob(B|A) via Equation 21.4
and target customers who have the highest Prob(B|A). But this may be a
poor idea if the customer&rsquo;s probability of being in the market (Prob(A)) is
small. It seems one should target the customer who is likely to be in the
market and likely to buy the focal product.
</p>
<p>Knott et al. estimate a hazard model for 271,000 customers (see Chinta-
gunta and Prasad 1993; Haldar and Rao 1998; Helsen and Schmittlein 1993).
The large sample is important because purchase frequency is very low. Once
the model is estimated, customers are scored according to Equation 21.10,
with the hazard model providing Prob(A), and the NPTB model providing</p>

that the NPTB + Hazard approach can generate significant additional prof-
its. The gain isn&rsquo;t uniform, but certainly on average, these results sug-
gest that a purchase incidence model (Prob(A)) is an important tool for
cross-selling.
</p>
<p>In summary, there are three ways to use hazard models for cross-selling:
</p>
<p>&bull; Predict how soon the customer is to buy any product and cross-sell to
customers who are likely to purchase soon (Harrison and Ansell 2002).
</p>
<p>&bull; Predict how soon the customer will buy any product and combine with
a prediction of which product will be bought, given the customer buys.
Target the product the customer is most likely to buy soon (Knott et al.
2002).
</p>
<p>&bull; Estimate a hazard model for each product and target the product that a
particular customer is likely to buy before the other products.
</p>
<p>In addition, there is the question of whether to target customers who are
predicted to buy soon or in a designated future time period. If the latter, the</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.2 Cross-Selling Models 533
</p>
<p>calculations are non-trivial because it is possible that a given customer might
purchase more than once before the designated period.
</p>
<p>21.2.2.2 A Hazard Model for New Product Cross-Selling
</p>
<p>The models discussed so far have identified which existing product should
be targeted to which customers. Kamakura et al. (2004) develop a model to
identify the best prospects for cross-selling new products. The challenge is
that there are no historical data for the new product. The authors develop
a &ldquo;split-hazard&rdquo; model that takes into account (1) whether the customer
will ever adopt the new product and (2) will the customer adopt the new
product soon. Both phenomena are modeled using a factor structure &ndash; the
&ldquo;penetration space&rdquo; for ever adopt, and the &ldquo;innovation space&rdquo; for whether
the product will be adopted quickly. The penetration component of the
model is:
</p>
<p>θij =
1
</p>
<p>1 + (νj &minus; wi)&prime;(νj &minus; wi) (21.11)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>θij = Probability customer i eventually will adopt product j.
νj = Location of product j in &ldquo;penetration space.&rdquo; This is an M-dimensional
</p>
<p>set of factor scores. Each brand in the estimation data has scores on these
dimensions, which represent attributes that drive eventual product adop-
tion.
</p>
<p>wi = An M-dimensional vector representing the importance customer i at-
taches to each of the penetration dimensions.
</p>
<p>Equation 21.11 is an ideal-point model. The probability of eventual adoption
will be high to the extent that product j is located close to customer i&rsquo;s ideal
point.
</p>
<p>The innovation component measures the hazard rate, the likelihood the
customer will adopt the product now. This is modeled as:
</p>
<p>ln(λij) = αj +Xiβ + ηjzi (21.12)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>λij = Hazard rate that customer iwill adopt product j at time t.
αj = Baseline constant for product j.
Xi = Demographic variables describing customer i. β is the importance of
</p>
<p>each variable in determining adoption. A positive β increases the hazard
rate and make it more likely the customer would adopt.
</p>
<p>ηj = Vector of factor scores for product j, representing how that product is
positioned on the factors that determine &ldquo;innovation,&rdquo; i.e., how soon the
product will be adopted.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>534 21 Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
</p>
<p>zi = Vector of customer-specific weights that represent the importance of the
innovation factors in influencing adoption for customer i.
</p>
<p>The authors combine the innovation and penetration models by multiplying
θij times λij for each customer for a specific brand. The challenge, how-
ever, is that the values for the penetration (νj) and innovation (ηj) factors
are not known for a new brand. The authors rely on expert judgment to
provide subjective estimates of these values. The judgment is aided by the
authors providing the positioning maps, both for penetration and innovation,
which locate each of the existing products. This provides the νj &rsquo;s and ηj &rsquo;s
needed to calculate the customer-specific θij &times;λij index. Customers are then
ranked by this index and the top customers would be targeted for the new
product.
</p>
<p>The authors apply their model to the pharmaceutical industry. The phar-
maceutical company needed to decide whether a particular physician should
be targeted for cross-selling a new drug. The authors estimate their model,
use five experts to provide independent judgments of the penetration and
innovation positioning, and compute cumulative lift charts to access how
well the model forecasts physician adoption of the new drugs. They com-
pare their model to a not-so-näıve model that ranks physicians according
to how soon they adopted existing drugs in the database. The model does
quite well. It achieves about a 2.5 to 1 top-quintile lift for four out of five
drugs, and a 4 to 1 top-quintile lift for one drug. The model clearly out-
predicts the näıve model, and all the experts do well and similarly to each
other.
</p>
<p>21.2.3 Next-Product-to-Buy with Timing and Response
</p>
<p>The strategy for the models reviewed so far is to determine what the customer
will do (what product they will buy next, when they will buy next) and
use that information to target the right product to the right customer at
the right time. Knott et al. (2002) field test demonstrates this can work.
However, what we really need to know is how the customer will respond to
a cross-selling offer, i.e., what incremental sales will be generated by cross-
selling a product versus not cross-selling it. This is the model developed by
Bodapati (2008).
</p>
<p>Bodapati assumes customers go through two stages in deciding whether
to buy a product. First they have to be aware of it. Second, given they are
aware, they must decide whether they have a preference (or &ldquo;satisfaction&rdquo; in
Bodapati&rsquo;s terms) for the product. If they are aware of the product and are
satisfied with it, they will buy it. Bodapati&rsquo;s model assumes that if the firm
recommends the product, it kindles awareness. This is where the incremental
value of the recommendation comes in. The model is:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.2 Cross-Selling Models 535
</p>
<p>P (Yui = 1) = P (Aui, Sui)
= P (Aui)P (Sui|Aui)(Un-aided purchase) (21.13a)
</p>
<p>P (Vui = 1) = P (Aui, Sui)
= P (Sui|Aui)(Cross-sold purchase) (21.13b)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Yui = 1 if customer u purchases product i on his or her own, without any
specific cross-selling effort; 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>Vui = 1 if customer u purchases product i as the result of a cross-selling
recommendation; 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>Aui = The event that customer u is aware of product i.
Sui = The event that customer u prefers or is satisfied with product i and
</p>
<p>hence buys it.
</p>
<p>Equation 21.13a shows that if the customer is not cross-sold the product, he
or she has to develop awareness on his or her own. However, if the prod-
uct is cross-sold (Equation 21.13b), awareness is automatically developed
(P (Aui) = 1), so purchase depends only on whether the customer likes the
product. The incremental impact of the cross-sell is Equation 21.13b minus
Equation 21.13a.
</p>
<p>Bodapati models awareness and satisfaction as logistic functions of an
unobserved set of d attributes, denoted by the vector xi, for product i. That
is,
</p>
<p>P (Aui) =
1
</p>
<p>1 + eα&prime;uxi
(21.14a)
</p>
<p>P (Sui|Aui) = 11 + eβ&prime;uxi (21.14b)
</p>
<p>where α&prime;u is a customer-specific vector reflecting the importances of the d
attributes in establishing awareness, and β&prime;u is a customer-specific vector
reflecting the importances of the d attributes in establishing satisfaction,
given awareness.
</p>
<p>Bodapati creates a simple adjustment for purchase timing. If the product
is recommended, awareness is automatically turned on, and if the customer
is satisfied, purchase occurs immediately. If the product is not recommended,
awareness is assumed to increase naturally on its own. Bodapati is then able
to show that:
</p>
<p>P (Yui = 1 during forecast period f)
</p>
<p>=
Tf
Tc
</p>
<p>P (Yui = 1 during calibration period c) (21.15)
</p>
<p>where Tf is the duration of the planning period (&ldquo;forecast&rdquo; period in Bo-
dapati&rsquo;s terminology) and Tc is the duration of the period during which the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>536 21 Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
</p>
<p>model is estimated. The incremental impact of the recommendation, during
the forecast period f,∆i, is therefore:
</p>
<p>∆i = P (Sui|Aui)&minus; Tf
Tc
</p>
<p>P (Sui|Aui)P (Aui) (21.16)
</p>
<p>The first term is the likelihood customer u will purchase product i as a re-
sult of the recommendation. The second term is the probability customer u
would have purchased on his or her own, if the product had not been recom-
mended. Equation 21.16 highlights the importance of the planning horizon. If
the planning horizon is long, it is more likely that the customer would have
purchased anyway and the recommendation will be less likely to generate an
incremental sale.5
</p>
<p>Bodapati estimates his model for an e-tailer. The data consist of 932 cus-
tomers and 1,681 products. Bodapati conducts a predictive test on holdout
data against two benchmark models: binary logit and collaborative filter-
ing. Both these models do not distinguish between recommended and non-
recommended products. There are total of 156,669 holdout observations. An
observation is whether a customer bought a particular product during the
holdout period; 149,269 of these observations are cases where the product
was not recommended, i.e., there was no cross-sell; 7,400 of these observa-
tions are cases where the product was recommended, i.e., there was a cross-
sell. For each observation, Bodapati calculates the probability of purchase
and then observes whether in fact the product was purchased. The resultant
lift charts are shown in Fig. 21.5. The figure shows that the proposed model
achieves significantly better lift, both in cases where a product was and was
not recommended.
</p>
<p>Bodapati&rsquo;s model is the first to incorporate which product the customer is
most likely to buy, when the customer is likely to buy, and how the customer
is likely to respond to a cross-selling recommendation. The model makes
some key assumptions, such as that a recommendation has a 100% chance
of making the customer aware, and does not influence the likelihood of pur-
chase, given awareness. In addition, the model does not take into account
previous product ownership, a hallmark of the next-product-to-buy models
reviewed earlier. The key to the model is incorporating response to previous
recommendations. No other model to date has done this.
</p>
<p>There may be simpler ways of incorporating data on previous recommen-
dations, such as a binary logit where the dependent variable would be whether
a product was bought, and the independent variables would be previous own-
ership and whether the product was recommended/cross-sold. The parameter
for response to recommendation would be heterogeneous across customers,
and this heterogeneity would be important in calculating the incremental
</p>
<p>5 Note there is an implicit assumption that Tf &lt; Tc, that is, the planning horizon is
shorter than the calibration period. This is usually reasonable, as a year&rsquo;s worth of
data might be available for estimating the model, and the planning horizon for the
cross-selling campaign might be one month.</p>

</p>
<p>gain for each customer of recommending the product. Bodapati&rsquo;s significant
contribution is showing that incorporating previous recommendation activity
is crucial, and that this can be done with an insightful model.
</p>
<p>21.3 Up-Selling
</p>
<p>In up-selling, the decision is whether to try to sell the customer more life in-
surance, a bigger computer, a second cell-phone, or software upgrade (Pfeifer
1996). The natural question is what is the up-sell potential, i.e., how much
more can we expect to sell to a given customer.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>538 21 Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
</p>
<p>One way of approaching this is to measure share-of-wallet. Assume a cus-
tomer buys $30 worth of groceries from an online website per week. If $30
represents 100% of the customer&rsquo;s total weekly expenditure on groceries,
there is not much up-sell potential. If $30 represents 40% of total weekly
expenditure, there is obvious up-sell potential. However, share-of-wallet may
not uncover all the potential for up-selling. Consider the customer who has
a $300,000 life insurance policy from Company A. Even if that is the only
life insurance policy the customer owns, there still may be up-sell potential
if the customer has funds to invest, etc.
</p>
<p>21.3.1 A Data Envelope Analysis Model
</p>
<p>A method for assessing up-selling potential, defined as the difference be-
tween maximum potential sales and actual sales, is data envelope analysis
(DEA). Kamakura et al. (2002) use this to assess the upside potential of 162
branches of a large Brazilian bank. This illustrates the use of DEA to uncover
under-performing case bank branches, but the application to customers is
clear.
</p>
<p>The approach is as follows. Find a linear combination of existing branches
that could produce the same or greater output than the branch being evalu-
ated, while using a fraction of the inputs. If that fraction is less than one, the
branch is inefficient because a linear combination of other branches would
produce more output using fewer resources. If the fraction is greater than
one, the branch is efficient. The model is formulated as:
</p>
<p>min

</p>
<p>⎧⎨⎩τ0 +&sum;

<p>where:

<p>ε = The &ldquo;non-Archimedean infinitesimal,&rdquo; a very small (&asymp;10&minus;6) number
introduced to guarantee the solution is not at an extreme point (e.g., 0).
See Chang and Guh (1991).
</p>
<p>The linear program finds the λ&rsquo;s to create a hypothetical branch that utilizes
no more than a fraction τ0 of the controllable inputs (Equation 21.17b) yet
uses no more uncontrollable inputs (Equation 21.17c) and produces at least
as much output (Equation 21.17d) as the evaluated branch.
</p>
<p>Kamakura et al. estimate two DEA models. The first takes the number
of tellers, managers, and employees as controllable inputs and treats vari-
ous measures of customer satisfaction as the outputs. The second takes one
measure of customer satisfaction as a controllable input and treats customer
retention as output.
</p>
<p>The authors analyze 162 branches and create reports illustrated in
Table 21.6. Example &ldquo;a&rdquo; shows that Branch #154 operates at 49.5% effi-
ciency (τ = 0.495) in creating customer satisfaction. A hypothetical branch
consisting of a linear combination of four branches could produce at least
as much output, using no more than 49.5% of the resources that Branch
#154 uses. This branch would use only 45% of the ATM&rsquo;s and 30.8% of the
employees that Branch #154 uses.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>540 21 Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
</p>
<p>Example &ldquo;b&rdquo; shows that Branch #154 operates at 78.3% efficiency in
translating customer satisfaction to retention. A hypothetical branch con-
sisting of a linear combination of three branches would require only 78.3%
of the satisfaction but produce at least as much retention as Branch #154.
In fact, this hypothetical branch would produce 18.7% higher share of wallet
than Branch #154.
</p>
<p>To apply this method to customers, the inputs would be marketing ef-
forts; the outputs would be purchase volume. Under-achieving customers
might be targeted for up-selling efforts. Although this would not guaran-
tee up-selling potential, the basic idea has merit and needs to be field
tested.
</p>
<p>There are also two methodological issues that merit attention. First is the
assumed linear production function. This of course makes things easier, but
in an application to cross-selling, one would be concerned about decreasing
returns to marketing efforts. Second is that the model is deterministic &ndash; it
does not explicitly take into account uncertainty.
</p>
<p>21.3.2 A Stochastic Frontier Model
</p>
<p>Kim and Kim (2001) construct a &ldquo;stochastic frontier&rdquo; model to estimate the
extent to which inefficient marketing has kept the customer from realizing
his or her true purchase potential. The model is as follows:
</p>
<p>Salesi = β0 +
K&sum;
</p>
<p>k=1
</p>
<p>βkXik + νi &minus; ui (21.18)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>Salesi = Current sales/revenue level for customer i.
Xik = Value for customer i on independent/predictor variable k.
νi = Unobserved factors influencing sales level for customer i, not related to
</p>
<p>marketing. Assume νi is normally distributed across the customer base,
with a mean of 0.
</p>
<p>ui = Unobserved factors influencing sales level for customer i, related to
marketing. Assume ui is distributed to be truncated normal, truncated at
0 from below, so that ui &ge; 0.
</p>
<p>Since ui &ge; 0, the maximum sales level for customer i is Salesi = β0 +&sum;K
k=1 βkXik + νi. The goal is to estimate ui for each customer. Kim and
</p>
<p>Kim (2001) show how this is done using stochastic frontier regression. This
technique also yields estimates of the β&rsquo;s and νi&rsquo;s, which then can be used to
calculate an estimated maximum sales level:
</p>
<p>MaxSalesi = β̂0 +
K&sum;
</p>
<p>k=1
</p>
<p>β̂kXik + ν̂i (21.19)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.4 Developing an Ongoing Cross-Selling Effort 541
</p>
<p>One can then calculate a percentage marketing inefficiency as ûi/MaxSalesi.
Customers can then be rank ordered on this measure, where a higher value
suggests more up-selling potential, and targeted for up-selling efforts accord-
ingly.
</p>
<p>Kim and Kim estimate their model using data from a life insurance com-
pany. The predictor variables include gender, age, employment, and various
customer behavior variables such as whether the insured person is the policy
owner, how long the customer has been a customer, payment method, and
location at which the policy was purchased. Most of these variables turned
out to be significant in predicting sales levels.
</p>
<p>Customers are then rank ordered in terms of up-selling potential (ûi/
MaxSalesi). It turned out the distribution of potential was skewed to the
right, suggesting a relatively small number of customers had significant up-
selling potential and should be targeted for increased marketing efforts.
</p>
<p>The stochastic frontier method shows much potential for identifying up-
selling opportunities. It is relatively easy to implement and understand, and
is not deterministic. It distinguishes between factors that are simply random
and factors that detract systematically from sales levels. However, the tech-
nique needs field testing to show that the estimated ûi&rsquo;s are due to marketing
inefficiencies, and not other factors that are beyond the firm&rsquo;s control.

</p>
<p>21.4.1 Process Overview
</p>
<p>Figure 21.6 depicts a process by which firms can develop an ongoing cross-
selling effort. The steps involve: setting strategy, collecting data, developing
the required marketing analytics, implementation, and evaluation.
</p>
<p>21.4.2 Strategy
</p>
<p>The first issue in setting strategy is to prioritize objectives: Immediate in-
crease in sales, long-term increase in customer contribution, or increase in
customer retention rate. We discussed these issues in Sect. 21.1.

<p>A second component of cross-selling strategy is the reliance on cross-selling
versus up-selling. If the product line is limited, the company might want to
rely on up-selling. Up-selling may also warrant emphasis if the goal is to
increase long-term sales. For example, upgrading a cable customer&rsquo;s package
to Premium increases sales not only this period but in future periods as well
(mt in Equation 21.1 increases permanently). If the emphasis is on long-term
retention, it might be more appropriate to emphasize cross-selling, since the
number of different products the customer owns may increase switching costs
and enhance long-term retention rates.
</p>
<p>Another component of cross-selling strategy is whether the efforts will
be &ldquo;product-centric&rdquo; or &ldquo;customer-centric.&rdquo; The entries in Table 21.7, which
might be derived from one of the models reviewed in Sect. 21.2, represent the
probability the customer will buy a particular product if it is cross-sold to that
customer. There are two approaches to approaching the cross-selling efforts.
In the product-centric approach, the firm finds say the top 40% of customers
in terms of their likelihood of purchasing the product and targets them. In the
customer-centric approach, the bank goes down the list customer by customer
and targets the product they are most likely to buy next. These need not
yield the same targeting plans. Table 21.7 shows that with the product-centric
approach, customer 1,002 is targeted with product D. Under the customer-
centric approach, customer 1,002 is targeted with product B.
</p>
<p>In favor of the product-centric approach is that: (1) It allows the firm to
target profitable products. (2) It avoids disappointing the customer with a
product the firm can deliver but not with the highest quality. (3) It helps
ensure economies of scale for all products. In favor of the customer-centric
approach is that: (1) Customers will be more satisfied because they are being
targeted with what they really want. (2) The overall program will maximize
sales since it is not constrained by having to offer low-selling items. (3) It
avoids over-burdening the customer with too many offers.
</p>
<p>The issue is perhaps best resolved depending on whether the organizational
structure is customer-centric or product-centric (Chapter 3). A company that</p>

</p>
<p>has powerful customer managers will urge a customer-centric approach to
cross and up-selling. Note that the customer versus product-centric choice
not a predictive modeling issue. The models in Sect. 21.2 can support ei-
ther strategy. Also, an optimization model could be developed to maximize
profits subject to product-centric as well as customer-centric constraints.
For example, product-centric constraints would be a certain number of ex-
pected sales per product, while customer-centric constraints would include
limits on how many cross-selling offers a customer can receive (to avoid
wear-out).
</p>
<p>Another strategic issue is competition. If the objective is market share
or share of wallet, competition will respond. This will require models that
infer customer ownership for competitive products (Kamakura et al. 2003).
Figure 21.7 outlines the issues taking into account competition. It identifies
the task, depending on what the customer currently owns, whether he or she
owns it from the focal firm or the competition, and how likely the customer is
to buy if cross-sold the product. Perhaps the toughest situation is when the
customer owns the product, but with another company. Then either the focal
company is trying to increase share-of-wallet or force a brand switch. Either
way, the cross-selling effort will yield lower response rates, and potential
competitive retaliation.
</p>
<p>Another issue is whether the cross/up-sell efforts will be executed in
real time or via campaigns (or some combination). An example of real-time
cross/up-selling would be a Website recommendation system. By campaigns,
we mean email, mail, or telemarketing campaigns that can be planned a
month or more in advance. This relates to the firm&rsquo;s channel strategy. If
the firm is trying to enhance its Web presence, it may emphasize real-time</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>544 21 Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
</p>
<p>cross-selling on the Web. This has important implications for what data need
to be collected and what models are feasible.
</p>
<p>21.4.3 Data Collection
</p>
<p>Cross-selling, especially customer-centric, may require a two-dimensional
360-degree view of the customer. The first dimension is that the firm may
need to know what products the customer currently owns. The second di-
mension is the firm may need to know what channels the customer uses. The
ideal database would include all products the customer has bought, from
which channel, and what marketing efforts he or she has been targeted, on
each channel. These data may be difficult to obtain (see Chapter 25).
</p>
<p>Another issue is whether the company will collect competitive data, i.e.,
does the customer own the product with another company. If the strategy
emphasizes competitive objectives, the company will have to invest in col-
lecting competitive data or in inferring competitive ownership using a model
(Kamakura et al. 2003).
</p>
<p>Whether the strategy entails real-time or campaign-based cross/up-selling
also influences data requirements. If the emphasis is on real-time, the data-
requirements may be less, simply because it would be difficult to bring all
previous activities and behaviors to bear in real time. If the emphasis is on
campaigns, collecting more data &ndash; the full two-dimensional 360-degree view
of the customer &ndash; may be worthwhile.
</p>
<p>21.4.4 Analytics
</p>
<p>At this stage, the firm must decide what predictive models it will use. We
have reviewed several models in this chapter, summarized in Table 21.8 along
several criteria. We classified a method as &ldquo;high&rdquo; on predictive accuracy if
it has been tested versus other models and shown to be superior. Not sur-
prisingly, the three models rated high on predictive accuracy are also rated
&ldquo;hard&rdquo; on implementation. The only model to-date that tackles what, when,
and response is Bodapati (2008). That model works well and provides inter-
esting diagnostics, but is nontrivial to estimate. It would be interesting to see
whether simpler forms of the model could capture what, when, and response
without too much of a sacrifice in accuracy.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of analytics is the application of optimization models.
There are two areas where such models could be applied: (1) balancing
cross-selling efforts between product-centric and customer-centric strategies,
and (2) optimizing cross-selling efforts over time at the customer level.
This is the domain of optimal contact models covered in Chapter 28. These</p>

<p>546 21 Cross-Selling and Up-Selling
</p>
<p>models have focused on catalog mailings over time but not on cross-selling
efforts over time. Similar issues would come into play in a cross-selling
context, but the predictive models would have to include more dynamics,
such as customer wear-out.
</p>
<p>21.4.5 Implementation
</p>
<p>Implementation requires organizational coordination, personnel training, and
automation. Organization coordination is perhaps the toughest challenge. Co-
ordination is needed between senior marketing management (to set the strat-
egy), information technology (to provide the data), marketing analytics (to
estimate the models that will drive the recommendations), service bureaus (to
deliver the offers), and product, customer, and channel managers (to resolve
which products and customers should receive priority, and through which
channels should the offers be delivered). A working hypothesis would be that
well-integrated organizations would be more successful at cross/up-selling,
since it requires so much coordination.
</p>
<p>Personnel training is also important. For example, a next-product-to-buy
model can be used to generate a series of if/then rules for what a catalog
phone representative should suggest as a cross-sell depending on the customer
(Lau et al. 2004). However, the representative needs to know how to process
these rules quickly. In-store personnel may need to be trained to recognize
what to cross-sell to which customers
</p>
<p>Another implementation issue is the actual creation and copy-writing of
the offer. We discuss various creative approaches in Chapter 27. The point is
that cross and up-selling can become very numbers-driven, and it is easy to
forget that if the offer is confusing or doesn&rsquo;t catch the customer&rsquo;s eye, the
campaign won&rsquo;t be successful.
</p>
<p>A final implementation is automation. Ideally, the cross-selling system can
be completely automated. For example, a market basket analysis can be used
automatically to suggest additional products in a Web setting. However, it is
difficult to program &ldquo;common sense.&rdquo; For example, an important issue, easily
automated once one is aware of it, is the need not to recommend a product
the customer already owns. For example, a market basket analysis may tell a
movie rental website to recommend Movie B to the customer, given the cus-
tomer is renting Movie A, but the customer may already have rented Movie B.
</p>
<p>21.4.6 Evaluation
</p>
<p>Evaluation needs to be tied to the objectives stipulated at the beginning of
the process. If the objective is just to increase short-term sales, simple control-
group tests such as reported in Knott et al. 2002; Tables 21.4 and 21.5) can</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>21.5 Research Needs 547
</p>
<p>and should be designed. If however the objective is long-term increases in
purchase volume or retention rate, tests need to run for longer periods of
time (e.g., 6 months or more). In lieu of long-term experiments, the firm
might survey customers and link measures such as purchase intentions and
satisfaction to cross-selling efforts.
</p>
<p>These evaluations may feed back to any previous step in the process. An
unsuccessful campaign may be due to a variety of issues. For example, if
the predictive model said the purchase rate among non-contacted customers
would be 2%, and it turns out to be 5%, probably the predictive model is
faulty, because these are customers in the control group who were not part
of the cross-selling campaign.
</p>
<p>21.5 Research Needs
</p>
<p>Cross-selling and up-selling have received a fair amount of attention in the
academic community. There are several models for predicting future customer
product needs and converting those predictions to cross-selling plans. There
is initial work on up-selling potential. Following are a few areas that warrant
additional attention:
</p>
<p>Cross-Selling Methods: Two opportunities for future research include (a)
incorporating previous marketing efforts in the cross-selling model, and (b)
comparing a broad set of models, both on holdout databases and in field
tests.
</p>
<p>Up-Selling Methods: The stochastic frontier approach is a promising tool
for assessing up-selling potential. DEA is also promising, but has not been
applied to up-selling. We need to compare the performance of stochastic
frontier, DEA, and other potential approaches based on estimating unrealized
potential.
</p>
<p>Field Tests: While the field test described in Sect. 21.2 is a convincing and
valuable test of at least one cross-selling model, we need many more such field
tests so we can begin to compare methods and understand the circumstances
under which cross-selling works and doesn&rsquo;t work.
</p>
<p>The Value of Cross-Selling and Up-Selling: More work is needed to discern
the relative impact of cross-selling on immediate sales, long-term contribu-
tion, or retention.
</p>
<p>Coordinating Cross-Selling and Up-Selling : We need methods for coordi-
nating cross-selling and up-selling activities across customers. We need the
capability to decide when a customer should be cross-sold as opposed to be
up-sold, and how cross-selling and up-selling activities should be balanced for
the organization as a whole.</p>

<p>Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>Abstract Frequency reward programs are customer development programs
based on the theme, &ldquo;Buy XXX, get a reward.&rdquo; &ldquo;XXX&rdquo; is usually a required
purchase volume, and the reward can be free product, a cash rebate, or even
&ldquo;points&rdquo; for another company&rsquo;s reward program. We discuss two ways that re-
ward programs increase sales &ndash; points pressure and rewarded behavior &ndash; and
the empirical evidence for each. We then review the rich economics literature
that has endeavored to answer the question, &ldquo;In a competitive environment,
do reward programs increase firm profits?&rdquo; We review several issues in de-
signing reward programs, including the reward structure, and conclude with a
review of reward programs offered by firms including Harrah&rsquo;s Entertainment
and Hilton Hotels.
</p>
<p>22.1 Definition and Motivation
</p>
<p>Frequency reward programs attempt to increase customer value by reward-
ing customers proportional to their cumulative purchases, revenues, or prof-
itability. Reward programs are used in a variety of industries such as hotels,
car rentals, supermarkets, credit cards, office products, telecom, and gaming
casinos. In fact, the airline industry&rsquo;s frequent flyer programs have in effect
created a new currency in the &ldquo;miles&rdquo; travelers accumulate. In terms of the
simple retention model of customer lifetime value,
</p>
<p>LTV =
&infin;&sum;
t=1
</p>
<p>mtr
t&minus;1
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)t&minus;1
(22.1)
</p>
<p>frequency reward programs strive to increase both retention rate (r, the cus-
tomer stays with the firm longer) and the amount purchased (mt, the cus-
tomer buys more to accumulate enough &ldquo;points&rdquo; to receive a reward).
</p>
<p>We differentiate between frequency reward and customer tier programs
(Chapter 23). Customer tier programs assign customers to segments or tiers
</p>

</p>
<p>and deliver different benefits to each tier. Frequency reward programs are a
narrower promotional-oriented activity. They focus on the delivery of a single
reward &ndash; a free flight, an upgrade, a coupon, etc. &ndash; based on accumulated
points.
</p>
<p>Both frequency reward and customer tier programs are often called &ldquo;loy-
alty programs.&rdquo; We do not use that term because loyalty may be a goal of
these programs, and they do increase purchase frequency. But whether they
increase &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo;, defined as &ldquo;a favorable attitude toward a brand result-
ing in consistent purchase of the brand over time&rdquo; (Assael 1995, p. 131) is
another matter.
</p>
<p>22.2 How Frequency Reward Programs Influence
Customer Behavior
</p>
<p>22.2.1 Mechanisms for Increasing Sales
</p>
<p>There are three mechanisms by which the program can increase customer
value: points pressure, rewarded behavior, and personalized marketing.
Figure 22.1 illustrates.
</p>
<p>The points pressure mechanism represents customers increasing their ex-
penditures in order to earn the reward. The attractiveness of the reward
obviously increases points pressure. Also, the reward program can create a
switching cost for the customer, in that the customer who decides to purchase
elsewhere forgoes the opportunity to accumulate points toward the reward
(Taylor and Neslin 2005).
</p>
<p>The points pressure effect should get stronger as the customer nears the
requirements for a reward. First, the reward is subject to less discounting as
it looms closer. Second, Kivetz et al. (2006) propose two psychological rea-
sons for points pressure: (1) Goal-gradient hypothesis &ndash; this is a behaviorist

<p>proposition originally due to Hull (1932) where organisms accelerate their ef-
forts as they get closer to a goal. (2) Goal Distance Model &ndash; this is based on
the psychophysical notion that humans make judgments relative to a bench-
mark. In the case of reward programs, the benchmark is the amount of effort
(e.g., the number of purchases) to reach the goal (earn the reward). Con-
sumers judge their progress by &ldquo;calculating&rdquo; the percentage of the distance
they have covered toward receiving their reward. The authors hypothesize
that motivation to reach the reward is an increasing function of this percent-
age.
</p>
<p>The rewarded behavior mechanism is when customers increase their pur-
chase rate after receiving the reward. Behavioral learning theory posits that
&ldquo;rewarded behavior is more likely to persist&rdquo; (Blattberg and Neslin 1990,
p. 22). Taylor and Neslin (2005) note that rewards can increase affect toward
the firm, which subsequently translates into higher purchase rates. Whether
the rewarded behavior effect is due to behavioral learning or increased affect
is important for distinguishing whether rewards truly increase loyalty or just
increase purchase inertia (Engel et al. 1995, p. 158).
</p>
<p>The third mechanism for increasing retention and purchase volume is
through the provision of personalized marketing efforts to members of the
frequency reward program. These efforts include individually targeted pro-
motions (for a retail store), cross-selling (for a gaming casino), or personal-
ized customer service (for an airline). These efforts are not rewards per se but
merely the company making use of what it learns about customer preferences
through the customer&rsquo;s participation in the program.
</p>
<p>Figure 22.2 illustrates the impact of the points pressure, rewarded be-
havior, and personalized marketing mechanisms on customer purchases</p>

</p>
<p>(see Taylor and Neslin 2005). Figure 22.2a shows the build up in purchases
due to the anticipation of the reward &ndash; the points pressure mechanism. Fig-
ure 22.2b shows an increase in purchasing above the previous baseline, due
either to the rewarded behavior or personalized marketing.
</p>
<p>22.2.2 What We Know About How Customers
Respond to Reward Programs
</p>
<p>22.2.2.1 Laboratory Experiments and Empirical Studies
</p>
<p>Lal and Bell (2003) examined programs of the type &ldquo;Spend $X over Y weeks
and earn a reward&rdquo;. For example, one program awarded customers with a free
ham if the customer spent $475 over a 6-week period. Lal and Bell grouped
customers by baseline sales levels (&ldquo;Worst,&rdquo; &ldquo;Better,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Best&rdquo;). Their
findings were important:
</p>
<p>&bull; The reward programs increased sales in the period leading up to the re-
ward. This supports a points pressure effect.
</p>
<p>&bull; The points pressure effect was strongest among the Worst customers and
weakest among the Best customers.
</p>
<p>&bull; The programs were generally profitable, due mainly to the increase in sales
among the worst customers.
</p>
<p>&bull; There was a positive post-redemption impact, strongest among the Worst
customer group. The authors had hypothesized that the post-redemption
effect would be negative due to consumer stockpiling, so were surprised to
find a positive effect. Our interpretation is that this was due to rewarded
behavior.
</p>
<p>Taylor and Neslin (2005) examine the same type of reward program as Lal
and Bell (2003). Customers who purchased $500 worth of product over the
8-week period leading up to Thanksgiving were awarded a free turkey. Taylor
and Neslin detect a points pressure effect in both years the program was run.
In Year 1, sales per customer increase $2.44 per week on a customer baseline
sales level of $37.91, a 6.1% increase, and $2.61 in Year 2 on a base of $41.02,
a 6.4% increase. The authors calculate profits based on this points pressure
effect and find the program to be profitable.
</p>
<p>Taylor and Neslin (2005) also measure a rewarded behavior effect. The
authors use a switching regression, where the first stage predicts whether a
customer will redeem for a reward or not, and the second stage predicts post-
redemption sales for redeemers versus non-redeemers. They find an average
weekly post-redemption effect of $14, which on a baseline of $80, represents
an increase of 17.5%. Taylor and Neslin also find that the rewarded behavior</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22.2 How Frequency Reward Programs Influence Customer Behavior 553
</p>
<p>effect is strongest among customers with low current baselines, similar to Lal
and Bell (2003).
</p>
<p>Kivetz et al. (2006) examine the dynamics of points pressure in a series
of field experiments. One involved a coffee shop, where the customer had to
purchase 10 coffees in order to receive a free coffee. Another involved a music
rating website, where visitors had to rate 51 songs in order to receive a gift
certificate. The authors found that both programs induced points pressure.
They found that the effect is gradual rather than a step function. This is
consistent with the authors&rsquo; goal-gradient and goal-distance theories. The
authors found three additional and intriguing results:
</p>
<p>&bull; When the coffee shop offered a two-purchase credit to start off, accelera-
tion toward the goal was faster. This supported the authors&rsquo; goal-distance
theory, because the percentage of the goal achieved was higher the more
coffees that were bought.
</p>
<p>&bull; After the reward, respondents &ldquo;reset&rdquo; their purchase levels to the baseline
levels before the promotion. This rules out stockpiling as a reason for the
higher pre-reward purchase rates, but does not support rewarded behavior.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customers who were closer to their reward program goal were more recep-
tive to promotions. This was investigated using a pencil and paper task, so
is exploratory, but the implications for the third mechanism by which re-
ward programs increase sales &ndash; targeted promotions &ndash; are obvious: Target
promotions to customers who are approaching their goals.
</p>
<p>Roehm et al. (2002) use laboratory experiments to investigate the impact
of reward design on future loyalty, i.e., the rewarded behavior effect. The
authors categorize rewards in terms of &ldquo;cue compatibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;tangibil-
ity.&rdquo; A cue compatible reward is one that is consistent with what the brand
stands for, e.g., a cue compatible reward for a supermarket might be a turkey.
Tangibility refers to the directness of the incentive &ndash; newsletters and clubs
are intangible, whereas price discounts are tangible. The authors hypothesize
that an intangible cue-compatible reward would increase loyalty because the
customer is encouraged to think about what the brand truly stands for. At
the other extreme, a tangible cue-incompatible reward could hurt brand loy-
alty by encouraging customers to think just about the reward and not about
the brand itself.
</p>
<p>Roehm et al. create an experimental reward program and choice simulation
for Slice soft drink. The cue-compatible, intangible reward was admission to
a web-site featuring games and puzzles for &ldquo;a refreshing change of pace&rdquo;
(p. 205). The cue-compatible, tangible incentive was a foam drink insulator.
The cue-incompatible, intangible reward was admission to the Slice website
featuring games and puzzles regarding fitness. The cue-incompatible, tangible
reward was gym towels. The results showed that all four incentives were
equally enticing in terms of brand choice. However, the impact on loyalty
differed by type of reward, as follows:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>Reward Impact on low knowledge

</p>
<p>Impact on high knowledge
subjects
</p>
<p>Cue compatible, intangible Increase No change
Cue compatible, tangible No change Decrease
Cue incompatible, intangible No change No change
Cue incompatible, tangible No change Decrease
</p>
<p>These results suggested a rewarded behavior effect only if the reward is cue
compatible and not too tangible. Also, the impact is only on customers who
are less familiar with the brand. Highly tangible rewards can decrease loyalty
among customers highly familiar with the product, even if the reward is
compatible with positioning.
</p>
<p>Roehm et al.&rsquo;s (2002) results are partially consistent with Lal and Bell
(2003) and Taylor and Neslin (2005). In both those studies, the rewarded
behavior effect was strongest among light users of the product. However, the
rewards were tangible, which would work against finding a rewarded behavior
effect. More work is needed to reconcile these findings.
</p>
<p>Bolton et al. (2000) studied the impact of a reward program for a European
credit card company. The authors collected data for 405 customers. They
found that membership in the program did not directly affect customer re-
tention or purchase volume. However, membership in the program decreased
negative perceptions resulting from poor service encounters. This may be due
to the reward distracting customers from evaluating poor service encounters.
</p>
<p>Many reward programs require the consumer to decide whether to en-
roll in the program. A simple comparison of sales among enrollees versus
non-enrollees will therefore be biased because it may be that currently loyal
customers are pre-disposed to enroll. Leenheer et al. (2007) control for this in
analyzing the impact of reward programs on share-of-wallet (SOW) for Dutch
grocery stores. They model SOW as a function of program membership, and
program membership as a function of store and household characteristics.
The first relationship is estimated using two-stage least squares, since pro-
gram membership is endogenous; the second relationship is measured using
a selection model. The authors find (1) program membership increases SOW
by on average 4.1 percentage points, and (2) this translates to a net rev-
enue increase (net of program costs) of &euro;163 per year. This analysis does not
determine whether the gain in SOW is due to points pressure or rewarded
behavior, but it has a firm footing in claiming a causal impact of reward pro-
gram membership on firm revenues by controlling for the customer&rsquo;s decision
of whether to join the program.

<p>22.2.2.2 Dynamic Structural Models
</p>
<p>Frequency reward programs &ldquo;try to change the customer&rsquo;s choice process
from operating in a spot market to operating in a multi-period, contractual
relationship market&rdquo; (Dowling and Uncles 1997). The customer realizes that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22.2 How Frequency Reward Programs Influence Customer Behavior 555
</p>
<p>purchasing from the company now has ramifications for future benefits, so
needs to take into account not only the current benefits of purchasing, but
future benefits as well. Dynamic structural models are designed to study
consumer decision-making when customers take into account both current
and future utility, especially when future utility depends on the decisions the
customer makes now.
</p>
<p>Characteristics of Dynamic Structural Models Relevant
to Reward Programs
</p>
<p>We first discuss the general structure of dynamic structural models so we do
not need to repeat it for each model. The customer&rsquo;s task is to choose a set
of decisions over a time period {t, . . . T} to maximize the net present value
of their utility:
</p>
<p>Max
Dikτ ,k&isin;Ciτ
</p>
<p>T&sum;
τ=t
</p>
<p>δτ&minus;1
&sum;
</p>
<p>k&isin;Ciτ
Uiτ (k)Dikτ (22.2)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Dikt = 1 if customer i chooses decision alternative k at time t.
Cit = Set of decision alternatives available to customer i at period t. These
</p>
<p>alternatives might include whether or not to purchase from a particular
firm; whether to &ldquo;cash-in&rdquo; points for a reward, etc.
</p>
<p>δ = Discount factor; the degree to which the customer values future utility.
Higher δ means the customer cares more about the future.
</p>
<p>Uit(k) = Utility customer i gains for choosing alternative k at time t.
</p>
<p>This decision problem can be equivalently expressed using the principle of
optimality, which says that the optimal decision for period t is that which
maximizes current utility plus the expected value of future utility that results
from the decision made in period t. This maximum utility is called the &ldquo;Value
Function&rdquo;, denoted by V . In particular:
</p>
<p>Vit(S(T )) = Max
Dikt,k&isin;Cit
</p>
<p>{Uit(k)Dikt + E&#13;Vi,t+1(S(t+ 1))|S(t), Dikt�} (22.3)
</p>
<p>where S(t) are &ldquo;state variables&rdquo; at time t. State variables influence utility and
change over time due either to a stochastic process or to the decision made
at time t. A key state variable in frequency reward models is the number of
points the customer has accumulated. The future values of state variables
such as price are uncertain, so customers may form expectations of these
variables (Erdem et al. 2003; Sun et al. 2003).
</p>
<p>A Simple Model for Examining Competitive Equilibria
</p>
<p>Kopalle and Neslin (2003) investigate competitive equilibria in reward pro-
grams. Their model is relatively simple. The customer decides each period</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>556 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>which of two airlines to fly as well as whether to fly at all. The choice set is:
</p>
<p>Cit =
</p>
<p>⎧⎪⎨⎪⎩
0 if customer i flies neither airline in period t
1 if customer i flies airline ABC in period t
2 if customer i flies airline XYZ in period t
</p>
<p>(22.4)
</p>
<p>The customer&rsquo;s utility function for each of these choices is as follows:
</p>
<p>Uit(k) =
</p>
<p>⎧⎪⎨⎪⎩
U0 if k = 0
ri1t &minus; (1&minus; INVi1t)P1t if k = 1
ri2t &minus; (1&minus; INVi2t)P2t if k = 2
</p>
<p>(22.5)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>U0 = Utility for not flying, i.e., for the &ldquo;outside category&rdquo; (e.g., traveling by
car).
</p>
<p>rijt = Customer i&rsquo;s preference for Airline j in time t. rijt follows a logistic
distribution with parameter aj .
</p>
<p>INVijt = The number of &ldquo;points&rdquo; customer i has applicable to airline j in
time t:
</p>
<p>INV ijt =
</p>
<p>{
0 if Dikt = 1 for k �= j
1&minus; INV ij ,t&minus;1 if Dijt = 1
</p>
<p>Pjt = The price of airline j in time t.
</p>
<p>INV is defined as a zero&ndash;one variable. If the customer has no points accumu-
lated for airline j and flies airline j, INV is set equal to 1. If the customer
had one point accumulated for airline j and flies airline j, the flight is free
(Equation 22.5). If the customer flies another airline or does not fly, INV is
set to zero at time t, irrespective of whether the customer had accumulated
points as of t &minus; 1 or not. That is, customers build up a &ldquo;credit&rdquo; by flying a
particular airline. They can cash in that credit for a free flight, but if they
don&rsquo;t, they lose the credit. This is meant to model points expiration, a char-
acteristic of some reward programs whereby customers lose points they do
not cash in.
</p>
<p>The state variables are INVijt and rijt . The customer is assumed to know
the current values of rijt and the probability distribution of rijt for future
periods. This means the customer knows his or her current preferences each
airline, but is uncertain about future preferences because future flight re-
quirements and schedules are not known.
</p>
<p>Kopalle and Neslin derive insights from their model: (1) The value of the
reward (the free trip) is increasing in δ, and hence a customer is more likely
to repeat-fly an airline if the discount factor is large. This makes sense &ndash; if
the customer cares more about the future, the accumulated points or credit
will drive current purchase more strongly. (2) The value of the reward is
increasing with the price charged by the airline. This is because the reward</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22.2 How Frequency Reward Programs Influence Customer Behavior 557
</p>
<p>is a free flight. This means that expensive tickets are more valuable rewards.
This is one reason why upgrades have become so popular. It is also why we
often see frequency reward programs implemented by premium brands such
as Hilton, Marriott, etc. (3) Reward programs expand the category if U0 is
large. If the outside category is not attractive, the market for Airlines ABC
and XYZ will be large whether they have a reward program or not. However,
if the outside category is attractive, category sales are currently low, but the
program can grow the category.
</p>
<p>A Model of an Online Retailer Frequency Reward Program
</p>
<p>Lewis (2004) studied the frequency reward program of an online retailer. If
the customer accumulated a threshold level of expenditures within a year,
he or she would receive a reward (500 miles to be added to the customer&rsquo;s
frequent flyer program). The reward is not free goods, but an indirect reward
that can be applied to another good. We will discuss the question of whether
to use direct or indirect rewards in Sect. 22.4.5. The choice set for Lewis&rsquo;
model is:
</p>
<p>Cit =
</p>
<p>⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
</p>
<p>0 if customer i does not buy in period t
1 if customer i buys a small basket (&lt; $50) in period t
2 if customer i buys a medium basket (&ge; $50 and &le; $75)
</p>
<p>in period t
</p>
<p>3 if customer i buys a large basket (&ge; $75) in period t
</p>
<p>(22.6)
</p>
<p>Discretizing the amount bought makes the model easier to estimate. This is
not a competitive model but there is an outside good, i.e., the customer may
decide not to purchase at all from the website. The utility function is:
</p>
<p>Uit(k) =

charge schedules that they varied over time.

<p>558 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>Table 22.1 Frequency reward customer segments (From Lewis 2004)
</p>
<p>Segment 1 Segment 2
</p>
<p>Percentage of sample 71% 29%
Mean annual # orders 8.7 14
Mean order size $77 $42
Mean spending $672 $586
Percentage earning reward 15% 1%
βiL 0.75 (p &lt; 0.01) n.s.
</p>
<p>FMift = Indicator variable of whether customer i was in cumulative purchase
group f at time t. The expectation was that larger cumulative purchasing
would mean the customer was learning to like the retailer so that the β&rsquo;s
for this variable would be positive.
</p>
<p>Lit = Value of reward customer i received in time t. The variable was coded
as 0 (received no reward), 1 (received 500 frequent flyer miles for accu-
mulating either $1,000 or $1,500 in expenditures), or 2 (received 1,000
frequent flyer miles for accumulating $2,000 in expenditures).
</p>
<p>The parameter of most interest is βiL, the utility of the reward. Lewis uses a
latent structure formulation to capture customer heterogeneity in the utility
parameters, thus yielding segments. Lewis includes an equation similar to the
inventory accumulation used by Kopalle and Neslin to keep track of expendi-
tures. If a given purchase will put the customer above a reward threshold, the
Lit variable is set to 1 for that period. Assuming a positive βiL, this provides
an incentive for the customer to purchase.
</p>
<p>Uncertainty in the model is incorporated via εikt &ndash; the customer is uncer-
tain before period t how much utility he or she will derive from decision k.
Prices are also assumed uncertain and Lewis assumes customers form expec-
tations for these prices. The state variables are the cumulative level of expen-
ditures (i.e., the points inventory count), recency, frequency, price, couponing,
and shipping. Lewis estimated the model and found two segments, as shown
in Table 22.1.
</p>
<p>The table shows that the majority of the sample derives extra utility from
receiving the reward. This coincides with their generally higher level of spend-
ing, and the fact that 15% of them did earn a reward. This is in contrast to
Segment 2, whose members derive no extra utility from the reward, and in
fact, only 1% of them earned it.
</p>
<p>The positive coefficient for the reward produces a points pressure effect.
This is shown in Fig. 22.3 (based on fig. 2, p. 290 in Lewis&rsquo; paper). It shows
that if a customer has accumulated $900, the closer he or she gets to the
end of the year, the more likely he or she is to purchase. Interestingly, if
a customer has accumulated only $500, there is a reverse points pressure
effect; the customer is discouraged from purchasing as time runs out. This is
a fascinating finding. Remember the customer is working through a dynamic
program. At the beginning of the year, achieving $1,000 in expenditures is
a real possibility and this spurs sales. However, toward the end of the year,</p>

<p>Fig. 22.3 Probability of purchase as time remaining to earn reward decreases (Adapted
from Lewis 2004).
</p>
<p>if the customer only has accumulated $500, the possibility is less real and
expected future utility (Vt+1 in Equation 22.3) is lower. This suggests one
must be careful not to set reward thresholds too high. It might spur sales
initially, but if many customers are not be able to make the threshold, they
will become discouraged and sales will fall.
</p>
<p>Lewis conducted simulations and determined that both the number of pur-
chases and the average customer revenue increases when the reward program
is in place versus when it is not, although the gain in revenues is only 2%.
Perhaps the reward (500 frequent flyer miles) was not that highly valued, and
in fact was not valued at all by 21% of the sample. Also, the threshold level
($1,000 for the first reward) was might have been set too high.
</p>
<p>Modeling both Frequency Reward and Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>Kopalle et al. (2006) develop a model of an airline&rsquo;s frequent flyer program.
The model is distinct in modeling (1) the decision of whether to redeem miles
for rewards, (2) the rewarded behavior effect, and (3) both a frequency reward
program and a customer tier program. The choice set is defined as:
</p>
<p>Cit =
</p>
<p>⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
</p>
<p>0 if customer i does not fly with this airline in time t
1 if customer i flies with airline in time t but does not cash in
2 if customer i flies with airline in time t and cashes in
</p>
<p>for level 1 reward
3 if customer i flies with airline in time t and cashes in
</p>
<p>for level 2 reward
(22.8)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>560 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>The utility function is:
</p>
<p>Uit(k) =

<p>l=1
</p>
<p>Dilt&minus;1 + εikt for k = 1, 2, 3
</p>
<p>(22.9)
</p>
<p>where Eist is an indicator variable of whether customer i has accumulated
enough miles to qualify for level s of the airline&rsquo;s customer tier program. If
the customer does qualify, he or she automatically is a member of that level
until either he or she accumulates more miles and hence qualifies for an even
higher tier, or a year has gone by and the customer has not maintained the
level of miles needed to remain in the tier.
</p>
<p>Note that αi2 and αi3 reflect the immediate utility of a level 1 reward
(upgrade) and a level 2 reward (free flight) respectively. The Dilt&minus;1 terms
equal 1 if the customer chose alternative 1, 2, or 3 in the previous period
(indexed by l); 0 otherwise. Therefore, βi1 represents the rewarded behavior
effect since it is added to the utility function only if the customer has cashed
in for an upgrade or a free flight in the previous period. The βi2 term
represents state dependence since it is added to the utility function as long
as the customer flew with the airline last period, no matter whether it was
a regular paid flight, an upgrade, or a free flight.
</p>
<p>The state variables are the cumulative number of miles flown and the
lagged decision variables. There are two sources of uncertainty. First, as in
the other models reviewed in this section, overall utility for each decision is
uncertain (the ε&rsquo;s). This uncertainty is resolved in the current period, but
unknown for future periods. Second is the number of miles the customer will
be awarded if he or she flies in some future period t+x. Kopalle et al. assume
that customers are aware of the average number of miles they fly when they
fly with this airline, and factor this in when considering the future.
</p>
<p>The authors estimate their model on 200 customers and find two segments.
The coefficients for the segments are as follows:
</p>
<p>Parameter Segment 1 Segment 2
</p>
<p>Percentage of Sample 6.3% 93.7%
Base utility of flying (αi1) 0.62 0.75
Utility of upgrade (αi2) 1.56 &minus;5.49
Utility of free flight (αi3) 1.77 &minus;9.89
Utility of first customer tier (λi1) 0.32 0.06
Utility of second customer tier (λi2) 0.54 0.14
</p>
<p>Utility of third customer tier (λi3) 0.75 0.22
Rewarded behavior effect (βi1) 0.45 0.60
State dependence (βi2) 0.42 0.38
</p>
<p>Segment 1, a distinct minority, has a positive utility for upgrades or free
flights. Segment 2 has a negative utility. Since the upgrade and free flights</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22.2 How Frequency Reward Programs Influence Customer Behavior 561
</p>
<p>parameters are a reduced form representations of the short-term gain minus
the short-term cost of these rewards, this means that many customers find
the benefits of cashing in for an upgrade of a free flight are not worth the
hassle. This is consistent with many customers failing to cash in points they
earn (Abu-Shalback Zid 2004a). This does not mean that Segment 2 will
never cash in. First, there is positive carryover from cash-in, so the customer
realizes that after they cash in, they will feel good about it. Second, random
variation in ε can make cashing in the highest utility decision. For example,
the customer&rsquo;s travel agent might notice the customer had a lot of accumu-
lated miles and offer to arrange the cash-in. This is why, in the actual sam-
ple, Segment 1 averaged 1.5 cash-ins per year, while Segment 2 averaged 1.1
cash-ins.
</p>
<p>The rewarded behavior effect is positive in both segments. The customer
tier program provides significant utility for both segments. The results sug-
gest the following interpretation of the segments. Segment 1 is &ldquo;loyalty pro-
gram enthusiasts&rdquo; They like both the short-term &ldquo;transaction utility&rdquo; (Thaler
1985) cashing in for upgrades or free flights, as well as getting the more long-
term customer tier reward. Segment 2 is more &ldquo;customer tier focused.&rdquo; They
like special treatment but have no need for upgrades or free flights.1 Obvi-
ously, both frequency reward and customer tier programs have a place in the
airline industry.
</p>
<p>22.2.2.3 Summary: What We Know About How Frequency
Reward Programs Affect Sales
</p>
<p>The results from laboratory experiments, surveys, descriptive empirical
analyses, and estimated dynamic rational models suggest the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Frequency reward programs do increase sales. The level of increase is high
enough to make these programs profitable.
</p>
<p>&bull; The points pressure effect is strongly confirmed (Lal and Bell 2003; Neslin
and Taylor 2005; Lewis 2004; Kopalle et al. 2006) even to the level of detail
that the effect is a gradual increase in sales leading toward the goal rather
than a step increase (Kivetz et al. 2006; Lewis 2004; Kopalle et al. 2006).
</p>
<p>&bull; The majority of evidence supports a rewarded behavior effect (Lal and Bell
2003; Taylor and Neslin 2005; Kopalle et al. 2006; Bolton et al. 2000).2
</p>
<p>However, the evidence is not uniform (e.g., Kivetz et al. 2006) and may
depend on the nature of the reward and the target group (Roehm et al.
2002).
</p>
<p>1 Note one cannot interpret differences in coefficient magnitudes between segments. Ob-
viously, however, the signs of the coefficients can be interpreted and compared. All
coefficients in the table are significantly different than zero.

frequency reward programs and share-of-wallet.</p>

<p>562 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>&bull; Various market segments react differently to reward programs. Both the
points pressure and rewarded behavior effects seems to be stronger among
light users (Lal and Bell 2003; Taylor and Neslin 2005; Roehm et al. 2002).
Dynamic structural models reveal two segments &ndash; one very much caught
up in immediate rewards; the other segment less interested (Lewis 2004;
Kopalle et al. 2006).
</p>
<p>22.3 Do Frequency Reward Programs Increase Profits
in a Competitive Environment?
</p>
<p>An area that has received much attention by economists is whether reward
programs produce higher profits in a competitive environment. The answer
depends on various characteristics of consumer response and on the types of
rewards used. We review the several studies on this issue in this section.
</p>
<p>Klemperer (1987a, b) identified two forces that influence the profitability
of frequency reward programs: (1) they create long-term monopoly power
and hence can increase profits, but (2) short-term competition can decrease
profits. The monopoly power stems from the points pressure mechanism,
which means that customers with points inventory want to repurchase the
product. The short-term competition develops because companies compete
more strongly to induce customers to make that first purchase so that they
begin to accumulate points. Klemperer (1987a) found that the net result of
these two forces depended on the functional form of the demand function.
</p>
<p>Beggs and Klemperer (1992) expanded this work by examining the im-
pact of a reward program when customers enter and leave the market. They
found that prices and profits uniformly increase in the presence of switch-
ing costs induced by reward programs. As enunciated by Klemperer (1995),
the firm is faced with the question of either increasing prices to exploit the
built-in loyalty of its previous customers who have accumulated points, or
decreasing price in the battle for new customers so they can be exploited
in the future. Klemperer maintains that current-period exploitation domi-
nates because (1) the future benefits of getting customers is discounted by
some factor less than 1, and (2) new customers are less price sensitive in
the current period because they realize firms can increase prices in future
periods.
</p>
<p>One limitation of this work is that the existence of the reward program
was exogenously specified; not a decision variable for the firm. Caminal and
Matutes (1990) consider offering a reward program to be a strategic decision.
The authors found that the profitability of reward programs depended on
whether they were of the form of either a &ldquo;coupon,&rdquo; promising a price discount
but not specifying the future price, or a guaranteed future price, e.g., buy one,
get one free. The authors found that the coupon reward program increases
profits, but guaranteed future price decreases profits. The reason is that the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22.3 Do Frequency Reward Programs Increase Profits 563
</p>
<p>coupon program allows the firm more latitude for increasing price later on.
With a pre-committed price, firms lose latitude and this accentuates price
competition. In addition, when firms choose between a coupon and a pre-
committed price reward program, the result was that the pre-committed price
was the equilibrium, implying that reward programs decrease profits.
</p>
<p>Kim et al. (2001) examined the rationale for reward programs in the con-
text of heavy users versus light users. The presence of the reward program,
its form (efficient versus inefficient), and price were the decision variables.
Efficient rewards are inexpensive compared to their value to the customer.
For example, a free airline ticket costs the firm very little, but is worth the
price of a ticket to the customer. Cash, however, is inefficient in that it is
worth the same to the customer and the firm. The authors found that the
light user segment can serve as the basis for a reward program. The light
users pay higher prices and don&rsquo;t earn rewards. In effect, the light users are
subsidizing the heavy users. This equilibrium is profitable unless the light
user group is price sensitive, in which case firms compete too strongly for
this group, driving down prices to the point that reward programs become
unprofitable.
</p>
<p>Kim et al. (2004) show how frequency reward programs can be profitable
if they are used to manage excess capacity. Many firms face seasonal demand
(e.g., hotels). Firms can let customers earn reward points during the high-
season, to be redeemed during the off-season. This is an important argument
since excess capacity is a chronic problem for so many companies. The strat-
egy hinges on the effectiveness of the reward program, i.e., customers must
be willing to earn points during the high season and redeem them during
the off season. This may be how reward programs work in industries such as
hotels, if rooms are only available as rewards during the off season.
</p>
<p>Kopalle and Neslin (2003) study the impact of market expandability and
consumer valuation of future benefits on the profitability of reward programs.
They assume the consumer follows the decision-making process outlined by
Equations 22.4&ndash;22.5 and that firms decide whether to use reward programs.
The authors find that if the market is not expandable, reward programs
are not profitable. The reason is that the power of the reward program is
directed at stealing market share from competitors, and competitors react
strongly. The competitive impact for a reward program is stronger than that
of standard promotions because the reward program locks up customers for
more than one period. This creates a higher stakes prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma. When
the reward program serves to grow the market, it achieves the benefit of a
powerful promotion without precipitating strong competitive response. The
result is higher profits.
</p>
<p>The authors show that frequent flyer programs appeared in the airline in-
dustry in 1981, coincident with the rapid entry of &ldquo;low-frills&rdquo; competitors.
The authors interpret this as the major airlines using reward programs to
enlarge their market. They also interpret supermarkets&rsquo; use of reward pro-
grams as a way of protecting their market against mass merchandisers such</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>564 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>as Wal-Mart (see Patton 2002). In both of these cases, the outside com-
petitor is unable or unwilling to respond to the reward program. The low-
frills airlines did not have the information system to offer reward programs.
Wal-Mart, although it certainly has the information system, would find re-
ward programs inconsistent with its positioning of everyday low pricing and
simplicity.
</p>
<p>Lal and Bell (2003) propose that reward programs eliminate competition
between retailers due to cherry-picking. They assume a Hotelling model where
two stores differ in which products are higher priced and which are lower
priced. The cherry pickers, located roughly in the middle of the Hotelling
line, buy the cheapest items at each store. This creates a transportation
cost for the cherry pickers, as they are not always shopping at their clos-
est store. If one store implements a reward program, prices generally in-
crease enough to make the program profitable without turning off the cherry-
pickers. However, if both stores implement programs the stores compete away
these profits. If in addition there are high and low cost shoppers, and both
stores offer frequency reward programs, profits can decrease depending on
how much each store discounts its lower-priced items. Overall this presents
a mixed view of frequency reward programs. If one store offers them and
shoppers are not segmented in terms of shopping costs, the reward pro-
gram can increase profits. But if both stores implement these programs, and
if customers are segmented according to their shopping costs, profits can
decrease.
</p>
<p>Overall, the theoretical evidence is that reward programs can increase
profits if they grow the market, &ldquo;exploit&rdquo; a price-insensitive light user group,
enable firms to pre-commit to a price discount and not to a specific future
price, manage excess capacity, or eliminate cherry picking. Certainly there are
examples where these conditions are met. The airline industry may be one.
Frequent flyer programs potentially exploit a large segment of light users, and
might grow the market. Frequent flyer programs persist today even though
the mass influx of new airlines has slackened, and even the lower tier airlines
can and do offer reward programs (e.g., Goetzl 2000). However, it is possible
that the frequent flyer programs are not growing the market in today&rsquo;s com-
petitive environment, and in today&rsquo;s market the infrequent traveler might in
fact be very price sensitive, in which case reward programs may be decreasing
industry profits.
</p>
<p>While empirical evidence has demonstrated that reward programs increase
firm profits on a marginal basis (Lal and Bell 2003; Taylor and Neslin 2005;
Leenheer et al. 2007), empirical work is needed to see if they increase profits
in a competitive industry. Indeed, competitors&rsquo; use of reward programs has
been found to be one of the most important determinants of a firm&rsquo;s decision
to adopt a reward program (Leenheer and Bijmolt 2003).</p>

<p>22.4 Frequency Reward Program Design
</p>
<p>22.4.1 Design Decisions
</p>
<p>Figure 22.4 depicts the design decisions involved with a frequency reward
program. Infrastructure involves the information system for collecting data
and awarding rewards. Enrollment procedures, reward schedules, and the
reward are fundamental decisions that define the reward program. Partnering
has also become a crucial element. Personalized marketing and partnering are
potential add-ons. Finally, the program must be monitored and evaluated.
</p>
<p>22.4.2 Infrastructure
</p>
<p>A reward program must have an infrastructure for collecting customer data,
determining which customers get which rewards, and then delivering the re-
wards. In a small shop this can be done by hand &ndash; the proprietor keeps a list
of customers and updates their totals whenever the customer makes a pur-
chase. However, when the customer counts reach into the thousands if not
millions, major investments are needed in computer information systems.
</p>
<p>These investments are not trivial. Even airlines, despite their large infor-
mation systems, still need to make sure they avoid mishaps such as assigning
top passengers to middle seats (Feldman 2002). Information system upgrades
range from $5 to $10 million for airlines (Feldman 2002). Another company</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>566 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>that one would expect to have ample information technology is American
Express. However, the company cited higher costs to run loyalty programs
as a cost factor that became a drag on earnings (Lee 2002).
</p>
<p>22.4.3 Enrollment Procedures
</p>
<p>The three alternatives are: (1) open enrollment, (2) fee for enrollment, and
(3) enrollment only by invitation. Most frequency reward programs are open
enrollment. Companies are eager to get customers onto their frequency reward
program so they can reap the benefits of increased sales, etc. The obvious
benefit of charging a fee is that it separates out the best from the worst
customers, thus allowing the company to reward its best customers. The
cost is the mixed message it gives customers: &ldquo;We want to reward our best
customers, so please pay us $25 and we&rsquo;ll reward you!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Another way to separate out best from worst customers is to make the
reward program available only by invitation. Viking Office Products, for ex-
ample, will not reveal the criteria for being included in their program and
does not promote their program (Miller 2001). The benefit of this approach
is one can limit the size (and expense) of the program and use complex crite-
ria (previous sales, future potential, etc.) to select members for the program.
The downside is the limited opportunity for the reward program to attract
new customers.
</p>
<p>22.4.4 Reward Schedule
</p>
<p>The reward schedule maps customer purchases to rewards. There are two
dimensions that define reward schedules: linearity and continuity. Continuity
refers to whether the customer earns rewards after each purchase or only after
reaching a threshold. Linearity pertains to whether the relationship between
purchases and rewards is the same no matter what the level of purchasing.
Figure 22.5 illustrates.
</p>
<p>The linear continuous schedule is very common. Many credit cards re-
ward customers one frequent flyer mile for each dollar spent. The advantage
of this schedule is its simplicity. It doesn&rsquo;t require the customer to &ldquo;jump
through hoops&rdquo; to receive a reward, and today&rsquo;s consumers don&rsquo;t like to wait
(Abu-Shalback Zid 2004b). Another advantage is that it continually rewards
behavior, and behavioral learning suggests continual reinforcement is most
effective (Rothschild and Gaidis 1981). However, linear continuous rewards
do not create points pressure. Consider a credit card program that offers
1 mile per dollar spent. If a competitor has the same reward program, the
customer does not lose anything by switching back and forth between the</p>

</p>
<p>credit cards. This nullifies points pressure. This might be addressed by using
a continuous but convex reward schedule.
</p>
<p>Yi and Jeon (2003) suggest that a linear continuous schedule may be bet-
ter for low-involvement services. This makes sense as it would appear that
high involvement is a necessary ingredient for customers to (implicitly) think
through the dynamic rational model (Sect. 22.2.2.2) needed to make decisions
under a nonlinear or threshold schedule. In addition, Keh and Lee (2006) find</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>568 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>Table 22.2 Convex (Schedule A) versus linear (Schedule B) frequency reward structures

<p>25,000 $100 $100
50,000 $200 $200
75,000 $400 $300
</p>
<p>that dissatisfied customers prefer constant rewarding, whereas satisfied cus-
tomers prefer a delayed reward. In summary, despite their disadvantages,
linear continuous reward schedules may work best for low involvement ser-
vices or with dissatisfied customers.
</p>
<p>Threshold reward structures set requirement levels at which point the
customer receives a reward. For example, 25,000 miles of travel may be
required for a free upgrade; a supermarket may reward a free turkey for
customers who spend at least $500 over a 2-month period. The prime advan-
tage of thresholds is they create points pressure. The customer with 24,000
miles on Airline ABC delays an upgrade by switching to Airline XYZ. The
disadvantage of thresholds is that behavior is rewarded infrequently, and
consumers may focus on the reward rather than on the brand itself. In
addition, the design of the exact stepped structure is a challenge. The re-
quirement levels should be set high enough to encourage more frequent pur-
chasing, but not so stringent that customers don&rsquo;t see the reward as a real
possibility.
</p>
<p>The thresholds can be linear, concave, or convex. For example, Schedules
A and B in Table 22.2 both have thresholds, but A is convex while Schedule
B is linear. Which program is preferred would depend on customer response,
which could be measured using a dynamic rational model. However, it would
also depend on competition, so the complete analysis would involve firm&rsquo;s
competing for dynamic rational customers using linear versus convex thresh-
old reward schedules.
</p>
<p>A related issue is whether points should ever expire. Expiration creates
more point pressure (Kopalle and Neslin 2003) and can be used to price
discriminate against light users (the infrequent flyer may finally build up
enough miles to earn a free flight, but by the time he or she is ready to fly
again, the reward has expired). However, expiration dates are more expensive
to handle from a data processing perspective, and can cause considerable
frustration and &ldquo;turn-off&rdquo; for customers.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of the reward schedule is how clearly it should be stip-
ulated to the customer. It seems that one would want to make the reward
schedule clear. For example, Cunningham (2002), states, &ldquo;the sheer complex-
ity of points-based schemes can be a turn-off. Many people with loyalty cards
do not take advantage of the offers because they do not have the time, or
the will, to work out what they are entitled to&rdquo;. Complexity could decrease
points pressure because the customer doesn&rsquo;t understand how much he or
she needs to accumulate to get a reward. However, there may two potential
benefits of complexity: First, the reward serves as a discrimination device,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22.4 Frequency Reward Program Design 569
</p>
<p>identifying those who really care about rewards (and will do the homework
required to figure out the program). Second, complexity could increase the
rewarded behavior effect: (1) The higher effort required to get the reward
creates a cognitive dissonance that is resolved in favor of the brand &ndash; i.e., the
customer asks, &ldquo;Why did I go through so much trouble for this reward,&rdquo; and
answers, &ldquo;I must really like this brand&rdquo; (Dodson et al. 1978). (2) If the cus-
tomer is unclear of the reward structure, the reward may come as a surprise,
surpassing customer expectations, and &ldquo;delighting&rdquo; the customer (Rust and
Oliver 2000).
</p>
<p>22.4.5 The Reward
</p>
<p>There are several attributes of the reward that should be considered:
Immediacy : This pertains to the length of time between when the reward is
</p>
<p>earned and when it is delivered. Smart cards, for example, can let customers
know immediately how many points they have accumulated, and the points
can be cashed in instantly (Kuchinskas 2000; Lucas 2002; Pepe 2002). The
advantage of immediacy is that coupling the reward with the correct behav-
ior creates powerful reinforcement (Rothschild and Gaidis 1981), enhancing
the rewarded-behavior effect. However, companies may decide to delay the
reward, even if they have the capability to deliver it immediately (Kuchin-
skas 2000). Decoupling of the reward from the behavior might encourage the
customer to focus on the brand experience instead of the reward.
</p>
<p>Direct vs. Indirect : Direct rewards are the firm&rsquo;s product or a similar prod-
uct. Indirect rewards are a different product or cash. Yi and Jeon (2003) found
that for high involvement services (in their case, a hair salon) direct rewards
were more effective than indirect rewards, whereas for low involvement ser-
vices (in their case, a fried chicken restaurant), direct awards provided no
advantage over indirect awards. One important form of indirect reward is
cash. The advantage of cash is the flexibility it provides to the customer &ndash;
the cash can be used in any way. Kim et al. (2001) advocate cash because
it forces firms to commit to high prices. However, cash is expensive for the
company. A cell-phone company can award a new cell-phone that is worth
$200 to the customer because that is how much he or she would have to pay
for it at retail. However, the company pays perhaps only $50. This is obvi-
ously less expensive than awarding $200 cash. In addition, non-cash indirect
rewards provide utility in the form of pride or prestige. For example, the
salesperson who has earned a unique sports jacket with an insignia can wear
that jacket with pride and enjoy fielding questions from peers as to how he
or she obtained it (Renk 2002).
</p>
<p>Price Discount vs. Pre-Committed Price: As mentioned earlier,
Caminal and Matutes (1990) conclude that price discount rewards are prof-
itable, whereas pre-committed prices tie the hands of firms and increase</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>570 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>competition. In their analysis, pre-committed prices were the equilibrium
if firms could choose between the two, which suggests price discount rewards
should be less prevalent than a pre-committed price. Indeed, the common
buy-x-get-one-free nature of many programs would be a prime example of a
pre-committed price. However, many retailer reward programs offer discount
coupons. The key is to separate the reward from the price of the product.
Premiums would do this just as well as a coupon, and are also common
rewards.
</p>
<p>Monetary Value: A key decision is the monetary value of the reward to the
consumer. For example, a credit card offered one point for every dollar spent,
and 5,000 points earned a $50 gift certificate (Polaniecki 2001). That amounts
to a 1-cent reward for every dollar spent, a 1% discount. Southwest offered a
free flight after 8 round trips (Goetzl 2000). That amounts to a 12.5% discount
per flight. A high monetary reward coupled with a reasonably tough reward
schedule (e.g., 8 flights for a free flight) can create a lot of points pressure.
A higher reward might enhance the rewarded behavior mechanism, since a
stronger reward should precipitate more affect toward the firm. However, if
the reward is too strong, it becomes the &ldquo;primary reinforcement&rdquo; (Rothschild
and Gaidis 1981; Rothschild 1987) and reinforces the use of reward programs
rather than the use of the product.
</p>
<p>Reward Attractiveness: This is similar to the question of monetary value of
the reward, but applicable to premiums and other rewards that do not have
clear monetary value. The same concern as with monetary rewards exists
in that too strong a reward diverts attention from the brand. One has to
be careful to anticipate the attractiveness of the reward in advance. Procter
&amp; Gamble offered Fisher-Price toys as a reward for frequent purchasers of
its diapers. P&amp;G under-estimated consumer response to the program, and
months after the end of the program, it still hadn&rsquo;t been able to fulfill all
the claims for the toys (Estell 2002a). This problem can be avoided with
laboratory pre-testing such as the work by Roehm et al. (2002) and Kivetz
and Simonson (2002).
</p>
<p>Multiple vs. Single Rewards: The provision of a menu of rewards allows
customers to select the reward they like the best, thereby increasing customer
utility (Lucas 2002). The main disadvantage of multiple rewards is cost and
complexity. For example, there is the question of whether the rewards should
be of equal value to the firm or equal value to customers on average, or both.
An airline may award a free seat (which costs nothing if it is available) or a
travel bag (which has a cost). If too many customers select the travel bag,
the reward program could be unprofitable.
</p>
<p>Luxury vs. Utilitarian Rewards: Kivetz and Simonson (2002) found that
consumers prefer luxurious rewards (facial massage, wine, jewelry, etc.) when
program requirements are more stringent. Stringency assuages guilt cus-
tomers might feel in receiving a luxurious reward. This suggests that if a
company uses a convex, threshold reward structure, luxury products should
be used for the higher thresholds, while utilitarian products can be used for</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22.4 Frequency Reward Program Design 571
</p>
<p>the lower thresholds. The complication is customer heterogeneity. Customer
A may consider eight flights to be an incredible effort, worthy of a lux-
ury reward. While Customer B may average eight flights a month, so re-
quires little effort. Still, the results suggest that if the program is targeting
low-sales customers and sets up a high hurdle, it may be better to use a
luxurious reward, since these customers have to work hard to achieve the
reward.
</p>
<p>Link to Brand Positioning : Roehm et al. (2002) suggest rewards should re-
inforce product positioning, and that the best way to do it is through intangi-
ble rather than tangible rewards. Access to a website with games and contests
that reinforce the brand&rsquo;s positioning is better for loyalty than a premium
that also reinforced the positioning but is more tangible. The problem with
intangible rewards is that they may not create enough points pressure &ndash; the
prospect of access to a website may not be a strong enough reward to create
points pressure (although recall that in Roehm et al.&rsquo;s experiment, all rewards
created the same number of purchases). This means that the gains in retention
from the program have to come entirely through the rewarded behavior effect.
There are many examples of reward programs that link well to product associ-
ations. For example, AT&amp;T Broadband, a television cable company, used pre-
miums such as a Disney watch or a Showtime director&rsquo;s chair (Beeler 2000).
Nantucket Nectars, a beverage company, capitalized on their bottle caps that
contained clever sayings by using caps as points for the reward program
(Estell 2002b).
</p>
<p>22.4.6 Personalized Marketing
</p>
<p>A major opportunity is to use reward programs to facilitate personalized
marketing efforts, especially cross-selling. Cross-selling efforts work best when
companies have data on customer purchase history (Knott et al. 2002), and
such data are collected via reward programs. As mentioned earlier, Kivetz
et al. (2006) found that customers were more receptive to special offers as
they got closer to earning a reward. This finding was exploratory, but sug-
gests how frequency reward programs and personalized marketing can be
integrated.
</p>
<p>It appears that personalized marketing is an under-utilized opportunity
for reward programs. Many supermarkets collect purchase data through their
frequent shopper programs, but few use those data to personalize marketing
campaigns. There are at least three possible reasons for this. First, person-
alized marketing requires data analysis and supermarkets are not ready to
undertake this task (see Leenheer and Bijmolt 2003). Second is privacy. Some
shoppers do not want supermarkets scouring their purchase records, looking
for &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; patterns (Weir 1999). In fact, laws have been proposed that
would allow shoppers to forbid supermarkets from collecting data on their</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>572 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>buying habits (Weir 1999). Third, supermarkets may be wary of customer
dissatisfaction that could result from tailored marketing campaigns. This
is because the personalized marketing would take the form of targeted price
discounts. Customer A could become jealous if Customer B receives a coupon
for a product Customer A wants to buy (Feinberg et al. 2002).
</p>
<p>22.4.7 Partnering
</p>
<p>An important trend in reward program design is partnering. Partnering takes
two forms: &ldquo;earn&rdquo; partners and &ldquo;burn&rdquo; partners. If members of Company A&rsquo;s
reward program can earn points by purchasing at Company B, Company B
is Company A&rsquo;s earn partner. If Company A&rsquo;s customers can spend their
points by getting discounted or free merchandise at Company B, Company
B is Company A&rsquo;s burn partner. Obviously, Company B could be both an
earn and a burn partner for Company A.
</p>
<p>The advantage of partnering is that it makes the program more attrac-
tive to customers. To the extent that Company A has many earn partners,
it is easier for customers to build up their point totals. To the extent that
Company A has many burn partners, the rewards are more attractive. Firms
have to be careful, however. Sharp and Sharp (1997) examine a program
in Australia that involved several retail outlets that served as earn and
burn partners for each other. They found that repeat purchasing did not
increase at most of the retailers &ndash; so many stores were partners that cus-
tomers did not have to change their purchase habits in order to earn many
points.
</p>
<p>Another noteworthy partnering arrangement was the AOL AAdvantage
Reward Program (Direct Marketing 2000). In this partnership, AOL and
American Airlines were earn and burn partners for each other (Regan 2000).
AOL allowed its customers to earn miles when they shopped at AOL shop-
ping affiliates, as well as when they flew on American Airlines. The miles
could be spent on merchandise or free trips. The program was launched with
much fanfare in 2000, but in January 2002, the program discontinued the key
feature of allowing customers to earn miles when shopping with AOL affili-
ates. The burn feature of the program, redeeming miles for merchandise at
affiliates, remained, but the earning miles feature has been dropped. What&rsquo;s
more, the financial value of using miles for merchandise has been called to
question. One report is that 50,000 AOL AAdvantage points could be used
for $187 in books, but those same miles could be used for a $500 airplane
flight (Drucker 2002).
</p>
<p>Despite examples of mixed success, partnering has become a common fea-
ture of many reward programs. Many credit cards have programs with multi-
ple burn partners, for example airlines, retailers, and travel agents (Polaniecki
2001).</p>

</p>
<p>22.4.8 Monitor and Evaluate
</p>
<p>As with any marketing program, it is crucial to monitor and evaluate reward
programs. This can be difficult because its desired impact is long-term. Sta-
tistical methods (e.g., Sect. 22.2.2.2 and Leenheer et al. 2007) are capable
of measuring the points pressure and rewarded behavior mechanisms as well
as the overall impact. Another way to evaluate reward programs is through
surveys (Bolton et al. 2000), especially if they can be conducted on a before
and after basis.
</p>
<p>22.5 Frequency Reward Program Examples
</p>
<p>22.5.1 Harrah&rsquo;s Entertainment 3
</p>
<p>Harrah&rsquo;s Entertainment has a highly successful reward program that includes
both a frequency reward program and personalized marketing. Harrah&rsquo;s oper-
ates 21 gaming casinos across the USA, serving 19 million customers annually.
Accordingly, Harrah&rsquo;s needs a large database to store customer information.
The data are stored in a Patron Database (PDB) and a Marketing Work
Bench (MWB). The PDB houses &ldquo;raw&rdquo; data and can be used for simple
look-up. The MWB includes data in a form that can be analyzed for per-
sonalized marketing efforts. Total size of the databases is 300GB, updated
on a daily basis. The data are at the customer level, and include hotel stay,
demographics, customer preferences, event attendance, games played, and
marketing offers received and responded to. The data are integrated at the
customer level across all Harrah&rsquo;s locations. This is truly a &ldquo;single view of
the customer&rdquo; (Chapter 25).
</p>
<p>Customers accumulate points by using Harrah&rsquo;s facilities, which can be
cashed in for merchandise, rooms, food, and cash. This is implemented
through the PDB database. Harrah&rsquo;s also uses the MWB database to design
various personalized campaigns. These campaigns consist of offers, compli-
mentary passes, etc. The campaigns can be targeted at individuals based on
predictive modeling. For example, Harrah&rsquo;s identified consumers with high
potential for increased visits based on their residence and gambling &ldquo;veloc-
ity,&rdquo; (literally how fast they play the slot machines). These customers were
then mailed offers for cash and food, and their visit frequency increased from
1.1 to 1.4 per month.
</p>
<p>The Harrah&rsquo;s reward program is integrated with Harrah&rsquo;s customer tier
program. Membership in the different tiers is based on accumulated points
thresholds, and each tier has specific privileges such as priority reservations,
seating, and check-in.
</p>
<p>3 Much of the material in this section is based on Watson and Volonino (2001). See also
Watson and Eckerson (2000).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>574 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>Overall, Harrah&rsquo;s estimates a 72% internal rate of return on their invest-
ment in information technology. They report strong increases in visit fre-
quency, profit, and cross-market facility utilization. The Harrah&rsquo;s implemen-
tation is a well-publicized &ldquo;success story&rdquo; (Swift 2001; Davis 2001; Koller
2001; Rosen 2000; Heun 2000). Two aspects of the program are noteworthy.
First, the data are very complete and provide a detailed profile of each cus-
tomer. Second, the program employs points rewards and personalized mar-
keting. The increase in customer profit undoubtedly comes through all three
mechanisms in Fig. 22.1: points pressure, rewarded behavior, and personal-
ized marketing.
</p>
<p>22.5.2 The UK Supermarket Industry:
Nectar Versus Clubcard
</p>
<p>The UK supermarket industry has witnessed an intense &ldquo;tit-for-tat&rdquo; compe-
tition with reward programs. Tesco began the competition in 1995 (Gofton
1998). At the time it was second to Sainsbury&rsquo;s, and wished to retain cus-
tomers and increase sales. Its &ldquo;ClubCard&rdquo; awarded 1 point per British pound
spent, and 1 point was worth 1 pence in discounts at Tesco. This equates to
a 1% discount. With profit margins of 5&ndash;7%, this represented a significant
reduction in margin for Tesco (Croft 1995). The question is whether this
paid off. Tesco claimed in 1995 to have overtaken Sainsbury&rsquo;s, and that the
ClubCard was a major factor (Croft 1995).
</p>
<p>There were two issues facing Tesco at this point. First was how Sains-
bury&rsquo;s would respond. Indeed Sainsbury&rsquo;s did respond with its Saver Card, a
frequency reward program with stepped rewards. The maximum number of
points that could be accumulated on one card was 5,000, representing &pound;2,000
purchases, which could be traded in for a discount of &pound;50, a 2.5% savings.
However, by 1998 they had also introduced an ongoing Reward Card that ri-
valed ClubCard (Marketing Week 1998). Second was whether Tesco would be
able to utilize the data collected to develop personalized marketing programs
that would earn additional profits. This was a crucial step. With a sacrifice
of 1% margin on a base of 6% margin, Tesco would have to generate 20%
additional revenues in order to break even.4
</p>
<p>Indeed, Tesco set out to utilize the purchase data collected from its Club-
Card members to tailor coupons and other discounts to shoppers. Each quar-
ter ClubCard mailed a communication to members that including points
totals, vouchers for redeeming points at Tesco, and targeted coupons. Tesco
reportedly creates 100,000 personalized versions of these targeted coupons,
</p>
<p>4 Let R = base revenues, m = base margin (6%), and δ = incremental revenues. Baseline
profits is therefore Rm, and profits under the reward program are R(m&minus;0.01)+Rδ(m&minus;
0.01). In order to break even, we must have R(m &minus; 0.01) + Rδ(m &minus; 0.01) &gt; Rm, or
δ &gt; (m/(m&minus; 0.01))&minus; 1 = 0.20, or 20%.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22.5 Frequency Reward Program Examples 575
</p>
<p>based on its analyses of purchase data (Gofton 1998). In 1998, Tesco reported
a 1/3 increase in its loyal customer base. It also reported coupon redemption
rates upwards of 30% (Gofton 1998). All indications are that the personalized
marketing aspect of ClubCard has been highly successful, even in competing
with Wal-Mart (Rohwedder 2006).
</p>
<p>Over time, Tesco also expanded its card to bring in more earn and burn
partners. By 2002, earn partners included Allders retail, Beefeater restau-
rants, H. Samuel jewelry, and several auto and tire centers. Burn partners
included an almost bewildering array of recreation and travel opportunities,
listed at the Tesco website (www.tesco.co.uk). Another recent burn partner
is Air Miles, an air travel rewards program.
</p>
<p>While Sainsbury&rsquo;s retained its own reward program during this period,
it was not apparently as comprehensive as Tesco&rsquo;s. That changed in late
2002 with the launch of Nectar. Nectar is a reward program representing a
consortium of four companies &ndash; Sainsbury&rsquo;s, BP gasoline, Debenhams retail
stores, and Barclaycard credit card (Kleinman 2002). The earn partners con-
sist of the four partners. The burn partners include Sainsbury&rsquo;s, McDonalds,
Blockbuster, and additional companies. In 2002, Nectar claimed 12 million
members, compared to 10 million for Tesco (Rogers 2002).
</p>
<p>Two fascinating questions emerge: First, how will the programs evolve
from this point? One intriguing possibility is that they will become branded
products, each consisting of sets of earn and burn partners and various points
schemes. Now, the main players in the UK market are Nectar, Air Miles (a fre-
quent flyer program for which Tesco is an earn partner), Tesco&rsquo;s ClubCard,
and Boots Advantage. There are other questions for the future. For example,
will rewards increase above the 1% of revenues mark that has become more
or less the standard?
</p>
<p>Second and most importantly, will these programs raise profits for mem-
ber companies? The sacrifice in margin requires either a substantial gain
in revenues or an increase in profits through personalized marketing. Rev-
enues could also increase if Tesco could raise prices. This would be the route
to profits suggested by Klemperer and others. Also, heavy users build up
more points and therefore have opportunities for burning their points with
airlines and other partners that have minimum requirements. So we have
the conditions in Kim et al. (2001) where the heavy user segment receives
more benefits than the light user segment. As long as the light users are
not price sensitive (see Kim and Rossi (1994) for an example where heav-
ier users were more price sensitive than light users), the outcome could be
profitable. The problem is that the light users may be price sensitive. First,
they may be lower income individuals. Second they may be store-switchers.
The important point is that Klemperer and his colleagues&rsquo; theories are ap-
plicable toward thinking about and assessing the profitability of these reward
programs.
</p>
<p>In addition, the rewards at least for Tesco take the form of cash reduc-
tions (i.e., coupons) rather than guaranteed prices. Therefore Caminal and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>576 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>Matutes&rsquo; (1990) recommendations also apply. However, the market growth
condition of Kopalle and Neslin (2003) would not appear to apply. The su-
permarket industry in the UK is relatively mature. The other route to prof-
itability is personalized marketing. Tesco&rsquo;s reports suggest that this has been
very helpful for them. In any case, the UK supermarket industry provides a
fascinating glimpse of the evolution of reward program competition and the
emergence of a reward program &ldquo;industry.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>22.5.3 Cingular Rollover Minutes
</p>
<p>The wireless telephone industry is concerned about customer churn. Cingular
created a reward program that allows customers to &ldquo;roll over&rdquo; unused minutes
from the previous month into the current month (Thomaselli 2002). This is
different from the standard reward program in that points accumulate based
on lower usage.
</p>
<p>Compete, Inc. reported that the program had strong short-term impact re-
ducing churn (Business Wire 2002). However, the impact wore away quickly.
Compete collects its data by observing web visit behavior. It measured po-
tential churn as the percentage of a firm&rsquo;s current customers who investigate
competitive offerings. Compete found that when Cingular launched its pro-
gram, potential churn increased by 9&ndash;27% among Cingular&rsquo;s competitors,
but remained level for Cingular. However, a month or so later, Cingular&rsquo;s
potential churn increased by 11% while its competitors&rsquo; improved. Compete
does not have access to actual churn numbers, relying instead on customer
search behavior as an indicator. The indication is that Cingular&rsquo;s program
caused many competitors&rsquo; customers to investigate Cingular, while retain-
ing Cingular&rsquo;s current customers. However, things leveled off after the initial
advertising campaign.
</p>
<p>It is still possible of course that Rollover Minutes paid off. In any case, it
is an interesting reward structure that could be used in various subscription
services. However, perhaps Rollover Minutes was &ldquo;merely&rdquo; a promotion that
had a positive short-term effect but little long-term impact. Part of the prob-
lem might be the lack of a true points-pressure effect. It seems self-defeating
to motivate customers not to use the service now so they can use it more
in the future. The points-pressure effect is to encourage more use now so
customers can get a reward in the future.
</p>
<p>22.5.4 Hilton Hotels
</p>
<p>The hotel industry is a repeat-purchase business with chronic customer loy-
alty concerns. This makes it ripe for reward programs. Hilton Hotels offers</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>22.5 Frequency Reward Program Examples 577
</p>
<p>Hilton HHonors, open to anyone at no charge (Deighton 2000; Bell et al.
2002). Members earn points by staying at Hilton Hotels, but also through
earn partners including various airlines, FTD Florists, and Mrs. Field&rsquo;s Cook-
ies. The points can be used for upgrades and stays at Hilton Hotels, or burned
at partners or converted to frequent flyer miles for free flights.
</p>
<p>Points are earned at a rate of 10 points per dollar. The dollar value of
the points depends on hotel and room availability. For example, 5,000 points
could earn 50% off a $128 room at the Hilton Alburquerque. That equates to
a 13% discount off a $500 investment. In contrast, 25,000 points could earn
a free weekend night at a $239 Hilton Boston Back Bay hotel. That is a 9%
discount off a $2,500 investment.
</p>
<p>The program is integrated with Hilton&rsquo;s customer tier program: Blue, Sil-
ver, Gold, and Diamond. Membership is based on the number of stays in
the most recent year. Benefits differ in terms of points earned per dollar and
special upgrade offers. An interesting aspect of the Diamond tier is the lack
of specificity in rewards. As reported by Deighton (2000), the strategy was
to lower Diamond members&rsquo; expectations and then &ldquo;over-deliver&rdquo; (&ldquo;delight
the customer&rdquo; (Rust and Oliver 2000)).
</p>
<p>Hilton also delivers personalized offers through HHonors (Orr 2000).
For example, in any given month, the company has 80&ndash;130 potential mes-
sages/offers to be included in the customer&rsquo;s statement. The company selects
about 14 of these messages based on variables such as previous stays, credit
card usage, and demographics.
</p>
<p>Hilton had specific motivations in starting HHonors. First was yield man-
agement. Hilton often has a pool of unsold rooms. The HHonors program
provided the data that produced personalized offers for customers to fill the
rooms. Second was to use partners to broaden the rewards it could provide
to its customers. Third was to use it as an inducement for hotel owners to
become Hilton franchisees &ndash; the benefit being access to reward program mem-
bers who would want to burn points at the franchisee&rsquo;s hotel. Fourth was the
more traditional motivation for reward programs &ndash; to build relationships with
customers. For example, they can cross-sell travel opportunities, and provide
better service by knowing customers&rsquo; preferences for rooms, etc., when the
customer checks in.
</p>
<p>Its conjoint studies suggested that one in five stays by HHonors was due
to membership in the program. These incremental stays are being given away
at a steep discount, but travelers spend additional money besides the room
when they stay at a hotel. Plus there are potential benefits due to rewarded-
behavior and personalized marketing that might increase the visit frequency.
Having said this, the company admitted that annual churn among HHonors
Diamond members is 40% (Higley 2002). This does not say what churn would
have been without the program, but this high number suggests that the
industry is very competitive and reward programs do not completely lock in
customers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>578 22 Frequency Reward Programs
</p>
<p>22.6 Research Needs
</p>
<p>Reward programs are a popular form of customer management. There are a
number of studies on reward programs but there is much more to be done.
There are three basic areas: (1) How do customers respond to reward pro-
grams? (2) Are reward programs profitable? and (3) What are the best ways
to design reward programs?
</p>
<p>Regarding customer response, we have strong evidence that points pressure
is a real phenomenon (Sect. 22.2.2), however, more work is needed to pinpoint
the existence and impact of the rewarded behavior phenomenon, and the con-
ditions under which it is most prevalent. In short, we need to know whether
frequency reward programs, sometimes called loyalty programs, really create
loyalty (see Shugan 2005).
</p>
<p>We have good theories suggesting the conditions under which reward pro-
grams will be profitable in competitive equilibrium. However, these theories
consider the points pressure mechanism (customers purchase more to receive
the reward) and do not explicitly consider the rewarded behavior and per-
sonalized marketing mechanisms. In addition, we need empirical studies to
discern the impact of reward programs on profits. The UK supermarket in-
dustry reviewed earlier would be a perfect venue.
</p>
<p>Finally, there are several aspects of program design that need to be in-
vestigated. The overall need is to determine what types of designs work best
under what circumstances. When should companies used continuous versus
threshold rewards, or convex versus concave versus linear? How instanta-
neously should rewards be delivered? How transparent should the rules be
for earning and burning points? How should earn and burn partners be se-
lected, and what should be the financial arrangement between earn and burn
partners? Is the best organizational set-up a company-run program with var-
ious earn and burn partners, or a consortium of companies banding together
with the program managed by an outsider? Another fascinating issue is the
frequent flyer points phenomenon. Frequent flyer points have become per-
haps the most prevalent reward used by credit cards and even supermarket
programs (see Tesco/Sainsbury example above). Research is needed to un-
derstand exactly what it is about this reward that makes it so attractive. A
final issue is reward program branding &ndash; e.g., Tesco seems to have branded
its ClubCard program. The methods to do this, and its benefits, need to be
better understood.</p>

<p>Chapter 23
</p>
<p>Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>Abstract In today&rsquo;s highly competitive environment, many companies have
made the strategic decision to protect and develop their most valuable
customers. This strategy is implemented through customer tier programs,
whereby customers are assigned to tiers &ndash; e.g., gold, silver, bronze &ndash; and ac-
corded different levels of marketing and service depending on the tier to which
they are assigned. We discuss various methods of defining the tiers and the
fundamental allocation decisions firms must make in developing customers
within a tier, possibly to the point where they can migrate to a higher tier.
We conclude with a review of actual programs used by companies such as
Bank One, Royal Bank of Canada, and Viking Office Products.
</p>
<p>23.1 Definition and Motivation
</p>
<p>Customer tier programs segment customers by their actual or potential prof-
itability (Zeithaml et al. 2001) and provide different services or product de-
pending on the tier to which they have been assigned. For example, a company
might divide its customers into &ldquo;Platinum,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; &ldquo;Silver,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bronze&rdquo;
segments or &ldquo;tiers,&rdquo; and treat customers in each tier differently. The assump-
tion is that segments defined in this manner will differ in their needs and
responsiveness to various marketing programs.
</p>
<p>Customer tier programs are related to frequency reward programs
(Chapter 22), and the phrase &ldquo;loyalty program&rdquo; is often used for both of
them. Indeed, customers may &ldquo;earn&rdquo; the right to be in a particular tier
based on their accumulated purchases. However, customer tier programs and
frequency reward programs differ in that frequency reward programs are nar-
rower, focusing on a specific, typically one-time promotional reward such as
free product. In contrast, customer tier programs provide customers with
a long-term different level of service or a different product, based on their
profitability.

<p>580 23 Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>Using the simple retention lifetime value formula, customer tier programs
can be conceptualized as follows:
</p>
<p>LTV s =
&infin;&sum;
t=1
</p>
<p>mstr
t&minus;1
s
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)t&minus;1
(23.1)
</p>
<p>where s is the segment (tier) index and mst is the profit contribution of seg-
ment s in period t, and rs is the retention rate of segment s. Customer tier
programs try to manage profits and retention on a segment basis. This por-
trays customer tier programs as segment-based customer-management pro-
grams. However, firms can also acquire customers who qualify for particular
tiers. In the fullest sense therefore, customer tier programs involve acquisi-
tion, retention, and development of customers.
</p>
<p>There are several motivations for firms to employ customer tier programs:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identifiability : With more complete information systems (e.g., Rasmusson
1999), many firms are now able to calculate measures of profitability for
each customer. This allows them to assign customers to profitability tiers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Importance of Companies&rsquo; Best Customers: As Peppers and Rogers state
it in their pioneering book, &ldquo;Some customers are simply worth more than
others&rdquo; (Peppers and Rogers 1997, p. 37). Once companies started cal-
culating customer-level profitability, they confirmed time after time the
adage, &ldquo;the top 20% of the customer base accounts for 80% of the prof-
its.&rdquo; It is not always exactly 80&ndash;20, but the principle is the same. Hartfeil
(1996) reports that the top 20% of customers account for 100% of Bank
One&rsquo;s profits. Raider (1999) reports that Diet Coke &ldquo;derives 80% of its
sales from the top 13% of its customers,&rdquo; while for Taster&rsquo;s Choice coffee,
the top 4% of customers account for 87% of sales. Storbacka (1994) re-
ports that some banks have a profitability distribution more like 25&ndash;225,
meaning that 25% of their top customers account for 225% of their profits
(they are losing money on their least profitable customers).
</p>
<p>&bull; Limited Resources: Companies are under increased pressure to produce
higher returns on investment (ROI) from a shrinking marketing invest-
ment. Given the relative ease in identifying a minority of its customers
of paramount importance, it is logical to focus those limited resources on
these customers to maximize ROI.
</p>
<p>&bull; Refocus from Acquisition to Retention: After an era in which the goal was
to sign up new customers, more companies are turning to customer re-
tention. Although not exclusively a customer retention strategy, the focus
of most customer tier programs is on developing and retaining existing
customers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Profitability Segments Differ in Needs and Responsiveness: In order for
customer tier programs to make sense, segments in different tiers must
differ in their needs and responsiveness. Research is finding that indeed
this is the case. For example, Zeithaml et al. (2001) found that profitability
segments of a major US bank differed in terms of age and income, their</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>23.2 Designing Customer Tier Programs 581
</p>
<p>perceptions of what defined service quality, what drove them to increase
bank usage and volume, and the impact that changes in product quality
would have on profits.
</p>
<p>&bull; Competition: Company A&rsquo;s current customers are Company B&rsquo;s potential
customers. Hence, Company A faces pressure to insulate their best cus-
tomers from competition. The strategy is to bestow these customers with
Platinum status and provide them with services that increase their loyalty
and are difficult for competitors to duplicate.
</p>
<p>&bull; Desire to &ldquo;Delight&rdquo; the Customer : Rust and Oliver (2000) define customer
delight as very strong customer affect caused by exceeding customer ex-
pectations (see also Hatch 2002). Oliver et al. (1997) provide evidence that
customer delight can lead to higher intentions and customer satisfaction.
Customer tier programs capitalize on the delight phenomenon by placing
their best customers in a high tier and exceeding their expectations. The
downside, of course, is that those customers placed in the lower tiers may
experience the opposite effect &ndash; their expectations for minimal service may
not be met. However, to the extent that the best customers account for an
overwhelming amount of profits, and that the market is highly competitive,
delighting one&rsquo;s best customers may be a wise strategy.

<p>Figure 23.1 suggests steps required to develop a customer tier program. First
is to review objectives. Next is to compile the database necessary for creating
the segments. Then begins an iterative process of defining customer tiers,
assessing the acquisition and development potential of each tier, allocating
acquisition and development funds to each tier, and developing the specific

</p>
<p>services and marketing efforts that will be provided to the customers in each
tier. The final step is to implement and evaluate the program.
</p>
<p>23.2.2 Review Objectives
</p>
<p>Reviewing objectives is a crucial step as it guides tier definition and the
allocation of funds. Some key issues to review include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Profits versus Revenues: Is the company concerned about profits or rev-
enues? Companies facing a huge debt from fixed cost investments (e.g.,
telecom) may really be more concerned about generating immediate rev-
enues than profits.
</p>
<p>&bull; Growth versus Stability : Is the company trying to grow its customer base?
Customer tier programs can be managed to defend the company&rsquo;s core
customers against competitive incursion, or used as an acquisition tool.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer Centric versus Product Centric: Customer tier programs are
primarily customer centric. The idea is to determine what members in each
tier want or need, and deliver it. If a company is product centric, it might
be better to segment customers on product ownership or psychographics,
rather than profitability.
</p>
<p>23.2.3 Create the Customer Database
</p>
<p>Creating the customer database can become a &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; for investment. It
is very tempting to try to capture every possible piece of information about
every consumer. This is where the review of objectives is important. If the
objective emphasizes revenues, then the key data needs are product usage,
billing and payments, RFM, and demographics related to expenditures. If
the emphasis is on profits, the database needs to include costs. The easiest
costs to assemble are those associated with the delivery of the product, such
as costs-of-goods sold or mailing costs. Even these can require integration
of several databases for the multi-product company. Marketing costs (direct
mail offers, calls to the service center) and risks of payment default are more
difficult to compile.
</p>
<p>23.2.4 Define Tiers
</p>
<p>The task is to determine how many tiers to have, and what level of prof-
itability will qualify each customer for each tier. The number of tiers and
profitability qualification may depend on the budget available. For example,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.2 Designing Customer Tier Programs 583
</p>
<p>Fig. 23.2 Hypothetical customer profitability quintiles (From Peppers and Rogers 1997).
</p>
<p>a company may define just two tiers, &ldquo;VIP&rdquo; and &ldquo;All Others,&rdquo; and decide
it can afford to provide 10% of its customers with the VIP treatment. The
company would then rank order its customers by profitability and invite the
top 10% to be members of their VIP program.
</p>
<p>A more bottom-up approach is to rank order customers in terms of prof-
itability, separate them into tiers, and determine the percentage of customers
that are &ldquo;crucial&rdquo; for the company. A simple method for doing this is a decile
or quintile analysis (Peppers and Rogers 1997, p. 39). Figure 23.2 shows a
hypothetical quintile graph. The graph shows that the top 20% of customers
accounts for 87% of profits, and that the company loses money on the lower
40% of its customers. This suggests that perhaps the top quintile (20%)
should be included in the VIP program.
</p>
<p>Two factors complicate this scenario. First is the difference between actual
and potential profit. Customers can be assigned to tiers according to actual
or potential profit. (Note the arrows in Fig. 23.1 between &ldquo;Define Tiers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Assess Potential&rdquo; run both ways.) Actual profit is much easier to calculate
than potential, which requires assessing responsiveness to marketing actions
(see Sect. 23.2.6). However, one could argue that potential profit is much
more meaningful. Using actual profit, a firm might identify a segment that
generates high profits, target special services at these customers, and have
no impact on their behavior! A better way might be first to assess profit
potential, then define tiers.
</p>
<p>While potential profit is difficult to assess, actual profit can be a significant
challenge as well. First is the question of profitability over what time period
(Rasmusson 1999) &ndash; the past 5 years, 1 year, or projected over the remaining
lifetime of the customer? Second is whether one can calculate profit or will
rely on indicators. For example, actual profit cannot be calculated for po-
tential customers to be acquired. This is why customer tiers can be defined
using lifetime value, life event (e.g., recent retirees), demographics, stage of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>584 23 Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>customer life cycle (newly acquired, growing, mature, declining) (Peppers
and Rogers 1993, pp. 190&ndash;193), product usage (Zeithaml 2000), or loyalty
(Reichheld 1993).
</p>
<p>The basis for segmenting customers into tiers can depend on the industry.
A large real estate company segmented customers based on the amount of
time it takes the customer to decide on a new home, marketing costs, cus-
tomer motivation/urgency to move, price sensitivity, likelihood of future pur-
chases, and referral potential (Zeithaml et al. 2001). A marketing research
firm defined customer tiers based on account size, willingness to plan re-
search projects in advance, willingness to try new services and approaches,
variety of methodologies employed, sales cost, referral potential, and loyalty
(Zeithaml et al. 2001). A pharmaceutical company defined physician tiers
based on prescription volume, prescription dollar value, sales and sample
costs, and gross margins of prescriptions (Zeithaml et al. 2001).
</p>
<p>The common thread is that defining customer tiers may require computa-
tion and integration of several measures of current customer value and future
potential.
</p>
<p>23.2.5 Determine Acquisition Potential for Each Tier
</p>
<p>Customer tier programs are primarily customer development efforts. How-
ever, customer tier strategies shift the emphasis of the customer acquisition
side of the business from &ldquo;get customers&rdquo; to &ldquo;get the right customers.&rdquo; This
is a challenge because it moves the company away from mass marketed ac-
quisition efforts and toward targeted methods. Ideally, the company should
be able to identify potential members each of its customer tiers in advance,
and then acquire them.
</p>
<p>A good example of developing an acquisition plan for a particular tar-
get group is presented by Ainslie and Pitt (1998) who analyze the customer
acquisition efforts of a credit card company. Under their scheme, top tier cus-
tomers are profitable, responsive to marketing efforts, and without a default
risk. As a result, the probability the potential customer fits the top customer
tier (P(Target)) can be expressed as:
</p>
<p>P(Target) = P(Responsive)&times; P(Profitable)&times; P(Not Risky|Profitable)
(23.2)
</p>
<p>Ainslie and Pitt develop separate predictive models for Responsiveness, Prof-
itability, and Risk, using a sample of approximately 3,000 current customers.
Figure 23.3 shows how various predictors were associated with each of the re-
sponses. The researchers created variables that combined income and spend-
ing habits. Income could be low, medium, or high. Spending habits could
either be &ldquo;spenders&rdquo; or &ldquo;savers.&rdquo; Figure 23.3 shows that low-income spenders
are more likely to be responders and more likely to be profitable on average.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.2 Designing Customer Tier Programs 585
</p>
<p>Fig. 23.3 Customer determinants of responsiveness, profit, and risk (From Ainslie and
Pitt 1998).
</p>
<p>However, they are more likely to be risky. This shows the trade-off between
profitability and default risk, and why it is important to consider risk as
another dimension of profitability. Middle income spenders are not different
from average in terms of their responsiveness, but they are more likely to be
profitable although risky. High-income spenders are more likely to be respon-
ders and more likely to be profitable, but not more likely to be risky than
average. Undoubtedly this is because they have the financial resources to
avoid default if they get overextended financially. In terms of demographics,
young families are less responsive and less profitable, but no different from
average in default risk. Urban upscale customers are far less responsive and
also less profitable, but no different from average in terms of risk.
</p>
<p>Ainslie and Pitt applied their model to identify potential new customers.
While the models were estimated on the firm&rsquo;s own customers (because those
are the customers for whom data were available), the models were used to
score prospects from a national list. First, the authors scored the prospects in
terms of their responsiveness. Second, they took the high-predicted respon-
ders from this list and scored them in terms of profit. Third, they took the
profitable responders and scored them in terms of risk. The result yielded a
set of prospects who were predicted to be profitable yet not risky responders,
i.e., members of the top customer tier.
</p>
<p>23.2.6 Determine Development Potential
for Each Tier
</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most difficult part of developing a customer tier program,
but really the most crucial. The goal is to assess the responsiveness of the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>586 23 Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>customers in a given tier to the services and marketing efforts that will be
provided to that tier. It therefore plays the crucial role in allocating funds
and designing programs.
</p>
<p>There are two approaches to determining the relevant response func-
tions, corresponding to whether the arrow runs from &ldquo;Define Segments&rdquo;
to &ldquo;Assess Potential&rdquo; or from &ldquo;Assess Potential&rdquo; to &ldquo;Define Segments&rdquo; in
Fig. 23.1.
</p>
<p>The simpler approach is to define segments first. In this case, we segment
customers based on their current profits, then measure responsiveness for
customers in each segment. These response functions will govern how much
is spent and what specific marketing efforts and services are used for each
customer tier. The customer responses of interest are retention rate and rev-
enues, since these determine lifetime value (Equation 23.1). The services and
marketing efforts may include special call-center phone numbers, free ship-
ping, easy check-in, free upgrades, up-selling, and cross-selling.
</p>
<p>The second approach, more complicated but perhaps more preferred, is to
measure the response functions at the customer level and then assign cus-
tomers to tiers depending on their response functions. For example, the ideal
customer to assign to the top tier would have high &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; profitability
combined with high responsiveness to marketing efforts. Another factor to
consider is the probability a customer can be &ldquo;migrated&rdquo; from one tier to
another &ndash; i.e., what is the chance we can turn a &ldquo;silver&rdquo; customer into a
&ldquo;gold&rdquo; customer based on marketing effort?
</p>
<p>Examples of the types of response functions that are needed are found in
the service quality literature (see Zeithaml 2000). These papers link service
attributes to perceived service quality (Bolton and Drew 1991a, b), perceived
service quality to customer satisfaction (Bolton and Drew 1991a, b; Rust
et al. 1995), and customer satisfaction to increased retention (Bolton 1998)
and usage (Bolton and Lemon 1999). Retention and usage (revenues) relate
obviously to customer profitability (Rust et al. 1995). Rust et al. (2000) take
a different approach, showing how service improvements improve three types
of equity (value, brand, and retention), which figure directly into financial
performance.
</p>
<p>This research employs managerial judgment or customer surveys. We
do not know of a field test of these approaches. This research has
studied service attributes, which are definitely part of customer tier
programs, but they have not studied the impact of cross-selling, direct
marketing, or advertising. However, they provide the best illustrations of
the types of response functions that are needed to show how the ele-
ments of a customer tier program translate into customer retention and
revenues.
</p>
<p>Wansink (2003) has conducted a provocative study comparing managerial
perceptions of customer potential with actual potential. He defined three
marketing programs, &ldquo;low,&rdquo; &ldquo;moderate,&rdquo; and &ldquo;high,&rdquo; that could be applied
to consumer packaged goods. The program definitions were as follows:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.2 Designing Customer Tier Programs 587
</p>
<p>Fig. 23.4 Profitability of low, moderate, and high marketing programs targeted at differ-
ent customer tiers (segments) (From Wansink 2003).
</p>
<p>&bull; Low: Quarterly one-page newsletter; $0.25 coupons included in the
newsletter; Receive product line merchandise (e.g., coffee mug) with 20
proofs of purchase and $5.00 postage and handling fee.
</p>
<p>&bull; Moderate: Quarterly full-color booklet; $0.50 coupons included in the
booklet; Receive product line merchandise with 20 proofs of purchase.
</p>
<p>&bull; High: Monthly full-color booklet; $1.00 coupons included in the booklet;
Receive product line merchandise with 10 proofs of purchase.
</p>
<p>Wansink then surveyed 132 packaged goods brand managers and asked them
which program would be most effective for which segment: current nonuser,
light user, and heavy user. The managers clearly responded that (1) in gen-
eral, the High-level program would generate the most incremental sales and
be most cost effective, (2) each program would be most effective (incremen-
tal sales and cost effectiveness) among heavy users, then light users, then
nonusers. For example, not one of the brand managers thought the Low pro-
gram would be effective among light users, whereas there was high agreement
that the High program would be very effective among heavy users.
</p>
<p>Wansink (2003) then tested these programs with consumers. He surveyed
643 consumers and randomly assigned each of them to a reward program &ndash;
low, moderate, or high &ndash; as defined above. He tested three product lines
(Kellogg&rsquo;s, Betty Crocker, and Land O&rsquo;Lakes) with each consumer. For each
consumer, he asked (1) their current level of purchasing, and (2) their antici-
pated level of purchasing over the next 12 months under the reward program
to which they had been assigned. He used this to calculate the profitability
of each type of program with each segment. The results are in Fig. 23.4.
</p>
<p>Figure 23.4 suggests two startling results. First, the High program is gen-
erally not the most profitable. Second, the most profitable program for
the heavy users is the Moderate program, the most profitable program
for the light users is the Low program, and the most profitable program
for the nonusers is the High program. The calculations showed that in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>588 23 Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>absolute terms, the heavy users generated the most incremental sales under
the High program. However, taking into account the costs of the program, the
profit picture changed dramatically. For example, Wansink calculated that
under the High program, heavy users would generate on average 2.4 more
units purchased for a revenue gain of $7.20. However, these customers would
be redeeming $6.70 worth of coupons, for a net gain of $0.50. Under the
Moderate program, heavy users would generate on average 2.0 more units
purchased for a revenue gain of $6.00, but the value of coupons redeemed
would only be $2.90 ($0.50 versus $1.00 coupons for the High program) so
the net gain was $3.10. Lavishing better treatment &ndash; $1.00 coupons &ndash; on the
heavy users did generate more incremental units, but not enough to cover
the costs.
</p>
<p>This study challenges the conventional wisdom of defining customer tier
programs to provide the most profitable customers (i.e., heavy users) with
the most benefits (i.e., the High program). Of course the study itself could
be challenged. Profit was calculated using consumer self-reported future pur-
chasing. In addition, the study was in a product, not service, industry, and
the rewards therefore were product and price oriented. However, the point
is well taken, that profit potential is key to designing a customer tier pro-
gram, and while heavy users may have the potential for the most incremental
sales, this does not necessarily translate to the highest profits. It may not be
profitable to lavish current loyal customers with extensive incentives.
</p>
<p>Kopalle et al. (2006) developed a dynamic structural model to examine
customer response to both frequency reward programs and customer tier
programs. They estimated their model for an airline that offered both a fre-
quent flyer program and a customer tier program consisting of three tiers.
Customers were automatically placed in a particular tier if they achieved a
certain number of miles within a year. We describe the model and findings in
more detail in Chapter 22. The authors found that indeed customer tier pro-
grams increase customer utility, with the higher tier benefits providing more
utility. Perhaps most important, the authors found two segments &ndash; &ldquo;loyalty
program enthusiasts&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer-tier focused.&rdquo; The loyalty program en-
thusiasts segment was smaller (about 6% of the sample) and cared about
the benefits of both the frequency reward and customer tier programs. The
customer-tier focused segment was much larger (about 94% of the sample)
and actually disliked the frequency reward program. However, they gained
utility from the customer tier program.
</p>
<p>23.2.7 Allocate Funds to Tiers
</p>
<p>Once we have assigned customers to tiers and understand the relationship
between marketing efforts and customer acquisition and how customers in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.2 Designing Customer Tier Programs 589
</p>
<p>each tier will respond to marketing actions, we can allocate marketing funds
to segments. We illustrate this process with two planning models. The first
is simple and not dynamic. The second includes more complexities such as
transitions between tiers and a period-by-period analysis. Both models are
motivated by the work of Blattberg and Deighton (1996) and Rust et al.
(1995), who consider trade-offs between acquisition and retention for single-
segment customer franchises.
</p>
<p>23.2.7.1 A Simple Fund Allocation Model for Customer Tiers
</p>
<p>This model allocates funds between customer development and customer
acquisition within each customer tier, subject to a budget constraint. The
model is relatively simple and can be optimized. Following are the decision
variables:
</p>
<p>Xia = Funds allocated to acquiring customers for tier i.
Xid = Funds allocated to retaining and developing customers in tier i.
</p>
<p>The key response variables are:
</p>
<p>Ai = Number of customers acquired for tier i.
LTV i = Lifetime value of a customer in tier i.
</p>
<p>We then assume the following response functions:
</p>
<p>Ai = Xδiia (23.3)
</p>
<p>LTV i = αi +X
βi
id (23.4)
</p>
<p>Equation 23.3 is the acquisition function. We would expect δ to be between
zero and one &ndash; the number of customers acquired would increase as a func-
tion of acquisition expenditures, but at a decreasing rate &ndash; and would differ
by tier. Also, Equation 23.3 assumes the company starts with no customers
in either tier. The acquisition equation could be expanded by adding a con-
stant term to Equation 23.3, indicating the initial number of customers in
each tier.
</p>
<p>Equation 23.4 summarizes how investments in each customer tier pay off
in terms of customer lifetime value. The term α reflects baseline LTV, or
the lifetime value of the customer if we do not allocate special marketing
efforts to that tier. The parameter β represents how well marketing efforts
increase LTV. Again we would expect β to be between zero and one, reflecting
decreasing returns to scale. If we then define,
</p>
<p>B = Marketing Budget
Π = Total profits,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>590 23 Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>the optimization problem is:
</p>
<p>Max Π
Xia,Xid
</p>
<p>=
&sum;
i
</p>
<p>{AiLTV i &minus;Xia &minus;Xid}
</p>
<p>=
&sum;
i
</p>
<p>{Xδiia(αi +Xβiid )&minus;Xia &minus;Xid} (23.5)
</p>
<p>s.t.
&sum;
i
</p>
<p>(Xia +Xid) = B (23.6)
</p>
<p>This is a nonlinear program with T &times; 2 decision variables, where T is the
number of tiers Acquisition and development expenditures for each tier are
the decision variables. The budget itself is not a decision variable. This as-
sumption of course could be relaxed.
</p>
<p>Table 23.1 illustrates an example of using the model. The top tier has
a baseline LTV (α) of $2,000, while the lower tier has a baseline LTV of
$300. Lower tier customers can be acquired more effectively (δ = 0.4 versus
0.3) while higher tier customers respond more strongly to marketing efforts
(β = 0.7 versus 0.6). The current budget allocates a lot of funds toward
lower tier customers, however the company is losing money on these cus-
tomers. Upper tier customers are profitable, but there aren&rsquo;t enough of them
and there probably is potential for development. The scenario is not unlike
many companies that in their early stages focus on increasing their customer
base. If, after reviewing objectives, customer count is the objective, this is
appropriate. However, if profits are the objective, Table 23.1 shows that the
optimal allocation is to shift funds from lower tier customers to upper tier
customers, even if it means fewer customers in total. This example is probably

<p>the quintessential motivation for customer tier segmentation &ndash; focus on the
more valuable customers.
</p>
<p>The above model illustrates the importance of knowing the response func-
tions (β and δ) as opposed to just current profitability (represented by α). It
is through this complete representation of both current and potential prof-
itability that a company can sort through how funds should be allocated to
customer tiers.

<p>23.2.7.2 A Markov Allocation Model
</p>
<p>We describe a Markovian model (Libai et al. 2002; Pfeifer and Carraway 2000)
that allows customers to shift among three states &ndash; upper tier, lower tier, and
not a customer &ndash; depending on marketing expenditures. The model is not
optimized but can be used to evaluate alternative expenditure allocations on
a pro formal basis. Figure 23.5 depicts the model. There are pools of potential

<p>We also have the following quantities:
</p>
<p>Ni = Number of available customers for tier i.
Ai = Number of customers acquired for tier i.
Ri = Revenues in tier i.
Pij = Probability move from tier i to tier j. i can equal 1 or 2, and j can equal
</p>
<p>0, 1, or 2, where 0 stands for not a customer, 1 stands for the upper tier,
and 2 stands for the lower tier. Thus P21 is the probability the customer
will move from the lower tier to the upper tier.
</p>
<p>All the above variables are indexed by time subscripts, which we do not
include for easier exposition. Following are the response functions:
</p>
<p>Ai = Ni(1&minus; e&minus;λiXia) (23.7)
Ri = αi +X

<p>(φik +X

</p>
<p>(23.9)
</p>
<p>Equation 23.7 is the acquisition response function. It exhibits decreasing re-
turns to scale and assumes the company begins with zero customers in each
tier. The term (1&minus; e&minus;λiXia) can be interpreted as the probability a customer
moves from the not-a-customer state to either the upper (i = 1) or lower
(i = 2) tier segment (P01 and P02). Equation 23.8 is the same function we
used for LTV in Equation 23.4. α is baseline revenues and β is the response
of revenues to customer development expenditures.
</p>
<p>Equation 23.9 is an attraction model representing the probability of
transition between tiers, i.e., the likelihood customers turn from silver to
gold, or regress from gold to silver. The φ&rsquo;s are baseline parameters repre-
senting whether a customer naturally moves from tier i (i = 1 or 2) to tier j
(j = 0, 1, or 2) each period. The γ&rsquo;s are the key parameters. For example, γ11
represents the impact of marketing expenditures on the customer staying in
the top tier. γ21 is the impact of marketing expenditures on turning a lower
tier customer into an upper tier customer. We would expect the retention
parameter for the top tier, γ11, to be positive and larger than γ12 and γ10.
For the lower tier, development funds would most likely serve to keep the
customer in the lower tier (as opposed to churning) but a key parameter
would be γ21, the ability of development expenditures to turn lower tier into
upper tier customers. So, we would expect γ22 &gt; γ21 &gt; γ20, but the larger
γ21 is, the better.
</p>
<p>The γ&rsquo;s might depend on the design of the program. For example, if the
customer tier program for the lower tier was highly price oriented (offering</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.2 Designing Customer Tier Programs 593
</p>
<p>coupons, free giveaways, etc.), it might be less likely to move those customers
into the top tier. However, a lower tier program that offered better services
(e.g., dedicated phone representatives), might be more likely to move these
customers to the upper tier.
</p>
<p>There are two additional key assumptions. First is that the company is able
to identify and target the customers that are in each tier. Formally, we assume
the company knows when the customer&rsquo;s response function (Equation 23.8)
changes from i = 1 to i = 2. This of course may be difficult and the firm might
rely on a surrogate number such as previous-year profits, or create a hurdle
value over which the customer is treated as if he or she is in a higher level
tier. The model therefore does not incorporate the risk of misclassification.
For example, the customer may be treated as a top tier customer, but might
have the response function of a lower tier customer. Treating this customer
as a higher tier customer would then be a mistake since the company would
be assuming the wrong response function for this customer.
</p>
<p>A second key assumption is that the costs of the program are linear in
the number of customers within a tier. This might not hold if the higher tier
involved very high service levels. For example, for an airline, the higher tier
might have access to the airline&rsquo;s lounge available at the airport. The airline&rsquo;s
ability to provide this service to all upper tier customers (as defined by their
response functions) might be convex in the number of upper tier customers.
That is, it would be nearly impossible to provide the top tier services to 90%
of the firm&rsquo;s customers.
</p>
<p>These two assumptions could be relaxed in a more sophisticated model.
Now, however, we focus on the insights generated by the model at
hand.
</p>
<p>Figure 23.6 shows calculations using the above model, assuming a fixed
budget ($2,000) for acquisition and retention each. The parameters show
that the top tier segment is more difficult to acquire but has much higher
baseline revenues. The top tier also responds better to development dollars
in that these investments are more effective at retaining them and preventing
them (negative sign) from leaving the company or regressing to the lower tier.
Development funds can help move the lower tier customer to the upper tier
(γ = 0.05) but the effect isn&rsquo;t very strong.
</p>
<p>Figure 23.6a shows that assuming an equal distribution of acquisition dol-
lars ($1,000 each to the top and lower tiers), it pays to allocate more of
the retention budget to the upper tier segment (achieving profit maximiza-
tion at around 85% allocation). This is undoubtedly because the upper tier
has higher baseline revenues and equal response to marketing dollars. This
would be the classic focus-on-the-best-customers result. Figure 23.6b shows
that assuming an equal distribution of retention dollars ($1,000 each to the
top and lower tiers) the acquisition budget should be completely allocated to
the lower tier. This is also an interesting illustration. Given that it is cheaper
to acquire lower tier customers (λ1 &lt; λ2), and given that the company is
spending money to develop customers in the lower tier ($1,000), it is more</p>

</p>
<p>These examples are just illustrations. Different parameter values could
easily tilt things in the other direction. For example, if retention dollars were
relatively ineffective for the upper tier, but had a strong effect on moving
customers from the lower to the upper tier, it would be worthwhile to allocate</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.2 Designing Customer Tier Programs 595
</p>
<p>most retention funds to the lower tier, not so much for helping that tier as
to convert these customers into upper tier customers.
</p>
<p>23.2.8 Design Tier-Specific Programs
</p>
<p>Once the tiers are defined and funds have been allocated, one must design
the specific service and marketing programs for each tier. This often involves
enhanced service levels &ndash; special call lines, special attention to deliveries,
etc. More broadly, it could involve special products developed for upper tier
customers based on their needs.
</p>
<p>A key design issue is how to develop programs that convert lower tier to
upper tier customers.1 Zeithaml et al. (2001) describe the efforts of Home De-
pot in this regard. Home Depot noticed that many of its lower tier customers
were being underserved because Home Depot was selling them materials for
home remodeling but was not helping them to manage the entire process.
Home Depot therefore opened Home Depot Expo stores targeted to current
lower tier customers who have the financial wherewithal to purchase a full
process-managed service for remodeling their home. While this is a good ex-
ample of designing a program to move customers up the &ldquo;pyramid,&rdquo; it is
not a highly targeted product &ndash; the store is open for everyone. There are
undoubtedly customers who investigate Expo but really are not suited for it
(see http://www.consumeraffairs.com/homeowners/home depot expo.htm).
</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of designing a customer tier program is shrink-
ing the size of the lower tier segment. One way this can be done is to cut
acquisition funds for this segment. However, if acquisition funds cannot be
targeted at upper versus lower tier customers, lower tier customers may inad-
vertently be recruited. The task then becomes to encourage those customers
to leave (Zeithaml et al. 2001). Most commonly this is done through high
prices and low service levels. However, this can create a backlash (since many
of these customers may have been recruited through special deals provided
in the hopes of attracting top tier customers), and generate negative word-
of-mouth.
</p>
<p>Another interesting issue in customer tier program design is the extent
of public recognition to extend to top tier customers (Shugan 2005). For
example, airlines often make announcements such as &ldquo;XYZ Airlines Platinum
customers may board now.&rdquo; This public recognition might enhance the loyalty
of top tier customers by increasing their sense of identity as an XYZ Airline
customer. However, the public recognition may ask the lower tier customers
to ask, &ldquo;Am I not special?&rdquo;, and as a result, diminish any positive feelings
they had toward the company.
</p>
<p>1 This assumes of course the company wants to create more upper tier customers. For
cost reasons, the company may not be able to afford to provide enough customers with
the special services accorded to members of the upper tier.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>596 23 Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>In fact, a major design consideration is whether indeed the customer should
even know what tier he or she is in. In addition to the recognition factor,
the advantage to the customer knowing is that this can provide an incentive
to purchase more, i.e., to earn the right to be a Platinum customer (Kopalle
et al. 2006). This especially works well if the company is using a transparent
method to assign customers to tiers, e.g., previous year&rsquo;s purchase volume.
However, it might be better under certain circumstances for the company just
to keep track of tier membership internally. For example, a catalog company
may still offer its high RFM customers special catalogs and services, but
without the &ldquo;Platinum&rdquo; appellation attached. The advantage of customers
not knowing their status is that purchase volume or marketing responsiveness
can change over time, and the company may decide it wants to change the
customer&rsquo;s status without alienating the customer. This is a crucial issue in
customer tier design &ndash; public recognition, customer awareness of status &ndash; and
needs careful research.
</p>
<p>A final note is that while from a marketing standpoint, we think of cus-
tomer tier development programs as enhancing customer value, sometimes
these programs are guided by cost reduction objectives. Cost reductions may
have a negative impact on revenues and retention. For example, an auto-
mated call center to serve the lower tier may save money compared to having
company personnel answer inquiries, but revenues and retention can decrease
because of the lower service level. This makes it difficult for these call centers
to pay out.
</p>
<p>23.2.9 Implement and Evaluate
</p>
<p>An important and easily overlooked implementation issue is organizational.
Does the company need to restructure its organization in order to imple-
ment a customer tier approach? Peppers and Rogers (1993, pp. 173&ndash;206)
argue that rather than product managers, effective customer management
requires customer managers (Chapter 3). For many companies, this means
an entirely different way of doing business. The value of the customer man-
agement system is part of the ongoing customer centric versus product centric
debate.
</p>
<p>Another crucial issue is the management of customer transitions between
tiers. If the company is using the profitability-first approach to creating tiers,
then classifying customers in tiers is a simple matter. Managers would wait
until the end of the year, calculate the profits generated by the customer, and
then assign the customer to a new tier as appropriate. For example, a lower
tier customer who generated higher than average profits might be assigned to
the top tier. This would take the form of a formal invitation to the customer.
One danger in managing this way is the customer&rsquo;s response function might
be that of the typical top tier customer, resulting in a mis-allocation of funds</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.3 Examples of Customer Tier Programs 597
</p>
<p>(see Sect. 23.2.7.1). Another danger is that the top tier may become too
large (e.g., the airline&rsquo;s lounge becomes too crowded), and so the Platinum
treatment &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t what it used to be.&rdquo; and the customer development impact
of Platinum membership diminishes.
</p>
<p>If the company is using a response-function-first approach to creating tiers,
individual response functions would be estimated at the end of each year. The
customer would be re-assigned if necessary according to his or her current
response function. In practice, the company might run a test among current
lower tier customers, the test being designed to measure these customers&rsquo;
response to some of the &ldquo;perks&rdquo; provided in the upper tier. Alternatively, the
company might survey a sample of lower and upper tier customers, asking
them to self-report their responsiveness to various upper tier perks (e.g.,
&ldquo;Would you buy more from us if you had a dedicated customer service number
that guaranteed no more than a five-minute wait for service?&rdquo;). The goal
would be to determine whether a customer seemed to be responding like the
customers in the tier to which he or she had currently been assigned, or like
customers in a different tier.
</p>
<p>In general the best way to monitor and evaluate the program is by setting
up control groups. Otherwise we can compile statistics such as &ldquo;revenues in
the upper tier group grew by 40% after we initiated the program.&rdquo; However,
we don&rsquo;t know what the growth would have been without the program, or
what growth would have been in the lower tier group if equal dollars had
been spent on that group.
</p>
<p>23.3 Examples of Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>23.3.1 Bank One (Hartfeil 1996)
</p>
<p>Hartfeil (1996) reports the efforts made by Bank One to implement a cus-
tomer tier segmentation strategy. It started with the belief that 20% of a
bank&rsquo;s customers account for more than 100% of their profits. Faced with
limited resources, the company focused its marketing efforts on that top
tier. For example, branch sales forces re-allocated their time toward top tier
customers.
</p>
<p>Hartfeil describes the important details of implementing a customer
tier program. First is the calculation of profitability. Bank One took into
account revenues, risk, and cost on a customer basis in defining profitabil-
ity, and ironed out difficult issues involving the timing of profit. For ex-
ample, if a customer has an installment loan and is in the last stages of
paying back that loan, he or she is not generating as much profit as one
who has just taken out the loan. One solution would be simply to cal-
culate profit generated by the loan in total. That would depict both cus-
tomers as equally profitable. But currently, it&rsquo;s the newer customer who&rsquo;s</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>598 23 Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>generating the profit. Bank One resolved this by calculating two measures
of installment loan profit &ndash; essentially the current profit and the total
profit &ndash; and incorporating both into defining their top tier customers. In-
terestingly, Bank One shied away from using formal lifetime value calcu-
lations because (1) they did not have enough historical information, (2) it
would be difficult to apply a projection to customers on an individual ba-
sis, and (3) short-term profit was very relevant and could be more easily
calculated.
</p>
<p>23.3.2 Royal Bank of Canada (Rasmusson 1999)
</p>
<p>Rasmusson (1999) describes the customer tier program at Royal Bank of
Canada. The motivation for the program was to improve customer retention.
They segmented customers into A, B, and C levels based on profitability.
Tier A customers were assigned account managers and were contacted two
or more times annually with cross-selling offers. Rasmusson reports that profit
per Tier A customer grew by 268% over a 2-year horizon, and the number
of Tier A customers grew by 292%. Aside from the increase in marketing
costs, there was a large investment in data warehousing required to calculate
profitability and conduct the segmentation.
</p>
<p>23.3.3 Thomas Cook Travel (Rasmusson 1999)
</p>
<p>Rasmusson (1999) also describes the customer tier program at Thomas Cook
Travel. The company divided customers into A, B, and C tiers based on an-
nual revenues. The key differentiating feature in the program was the level
of service provided to each tier. The most challenging aspect of this program
was that travel agents had to decrease their service levels to certain clients (C
customers) whereas the mentality of the company had traditionally been to
provide all customers with superior service. Thomas Cook provides the infor-
mation agents need to identify A, B, or C clients, and agents receive detailed
records of the A clients so they can tailor sales pitches to these customers&rsquo;
particular tastes and needs.
</p>
<p>23.3.4 Canadian Grocery Store Chain (Grant and
Schlesinger 1995)
</p>
<p>Grant and Schlesinger (1995) discuss the potential for customer tier seg-
mentation at a Canadian grocery chain. They emphasize three aspects of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.3 Examples of Customer Tier Programs 599
</p>
<p>customer value: how many customers the company has, what their behav-
ior is, and how long they stay with the company. These are the elements
of the total lifetime value of the firm&rsquo;s customers. The chain segmented the
customer base for a typical store into three tiers based on &ldquo;share of wallet&rdquo;:
primary shoppers (&gt;80%), secondary shoppers (10&ndash;50%), and non-shoppers.
They then calculated the profit margin impact of changes in the behavior
of these groups. Due to the nature of the business with high fixed cost and
small operating margins, relatively minor changes in these customer tiers
could produce huge increases in profitability. For example, expanding the
primary shopper segment by 2% would increase profitability by 45%. Mov-
ing 200 secondary shoppers to primary status would increase profits by more
than 20%. Decreasing the churn rate from current 20% per year to 10%
would double customer lifetime (and hence approximately double lifetime
value).
</p>
<p>This example points out the need to focus on all customer tiers as a source
of profits, and the value of viewing lower tiers as a source of upper tier
customers, rather than as customers to be &ldquo;fired.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>23.3.5 Major US Bank (Rust et al. 2000)
</p>
<p>Rust et al. (2000, pp. 195&ndash;202) describe a customer tier example based on a
major US bank that utilized in-house profitability information merged with
survey data. The profitability information served to form the segments, while
the survey data served to understand the needs of each segments and how
they would respond to various marketing programs. Rust et al. divided the
customers into two pools based on profitability: the top 20% (Gold) and the
bottom 80% (Iron).
</p>
<p>The tiers differed significantly in profitability &ndash; the Gold tier had an aver-
age account balance that was 5 times bigger than a member of the Iron tier,
and average profit that was 18 times bigger. The tiers differed in terms of
demographics (Gold being older with higher annual income). Most intriguing
were the very different perspectives of customers in each tier on defining
quality and on profitability drivers. The Gold tier defined quality in terms of
personal respect, reliability, and speed. The Iron tier did not think of reliabil-
ity as part of quality. This makes sense since as less frequent users of the bank,
reliability would be less salient to them. The authors analyzed the propensity
of each tier to adopt new products offered by the bank (&ldquo;incidence&rdquo;), and
the volume of the new business (&ldquo;volume&rdquo;). They found that for the Gold
tier, incidence was driven by speed whereas for the Iron tier, incidence was
driven by personal attention. The implications for differing marketing pro-
grams are obvious. In addition, the authors found that the Gold tier was more
responsive to changes in service improvements than the Iron tier (essentially,
βGold &gt; βIron in terms of Equations 23.4 or 23.8).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>600 23 Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>The implication of this analysis was that the company should focus its
retention budget on improving speed of service for the Gold group. Speed
drives incidence and volume for this group, and this group responds more
strongly to changes in service than the Iron group. Of course, these implica-
tions could be analyzed more extensively using one of the planning models
described above.
</p>
<p>This example points out the benefits of integrating in-house and survey
data. The in-house data are necessary for defining the segments, because
these data are available for each customer and include the required detail
for profitability calculations. The survey data can be collected for a sample
within each tier. These data provide information on tier differences that pro-
vide guidance on how to design marketing programs for each tier. In addition,
through regressions such as Volume = f(speed, personal respect, reliability),
one has guidance on where various improvements will pay off. What is needed
still is a translation from expenditures to changes in attributes. For example,
Speed = f(expenditures), etc. This would provide the response parameters
needed to make budget decisions. See Rust et al. (1995, Fig. 23.6) for a dis-
cussion of how one might derive these functions.
</p>
<p>23.3.6 Viking Office Products (Miller 2001)
</p>
<p>Viking Office Products is an office product catalog company whose customer
tier program has three levels &ndash; platinum (consisting of 500 of the best cus-
tomers), gold, and silver. Membership in these tiers is based on current
and future potential spending. The benefit line-up illustrates the extent to
which services can be tailored to various segments. These benefits, which
differ from tier to tier, include specialized phone lines for placing orders,
free shipping, lifetime guarantees, special pricing, free samples and gifts,
personalized order pads, and access to the best, most experienced phone
representatives.
</p>
<p>23.3.7 Swedbank (Storbacka and Luukinen 1994, see
also Storbacka 1993)
</p>
<p>Sparbanken Sverige AB (Swedbank) was formed as the merger of 12 regional
banks in Scandinavia. Swedbank did not design different marketing programs
for different tiers. Instead, Swedbank implemented changes in bank-wide poli-
cies that affected various tiers differently.
</p>
<p>Upon completion of the merger, Swedbank decided that it would adopt
a two-pronged strategy: (1) focus on existing customers, and (2) create effi-
ciencies such as pricing proportional to usage. The first step was an analysis</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.4 Risks in Implementing Customer Tier Programs 601
</p>
<p>of 214,000 customers from 32 branches. Swedbank found that volume (dollar
value of deposits, etc.) and profitability were not highly correlated. In fact
higher volume was associated with much more dispersion in profitability.
Swedbank also found that more than 50% of its customers were unprofitable,
and that profit was highly concentrated among the best customers: the top
3% of customers accounted for 54% of profits, 6% accounted for 98%, and
32% accounted for 205% of profits. The bank found that the key differen-
tiators in profits, even after controlling for volume, were reliance on checks
(as opposed to a bankcard) and tellers (as opposed to an ATM). The reliance
on checks was especially unprofitable.
</p>
<p>Swedbank then instituted changes, perhaps the most dramatic of which
was to charge for checks, although the charge was reduced for customers who
had profitable behavior (e.g., use of ATMs). A new high interest account was
developed for high-volume investments, and the bankcard was made easier to
use. In addition, Swedbank undertook marketing communications to explain
the changes and emphasize the wastefulness of checks. The changes were com-
municated to employees (who themselves were often unprofitable customers)
and employees contacted best customers personally to explain the changes.
</p>
<p>The result was an 84% reduction in the use of checks, which is not sur-
prising. More striking was the disproportionate number of defections among
unprofitable customers. For example, of the defections that ensued, fewer
than 1% were from the most profitable customers, and 80% were from low
volume, unprofitable customers. The example shows that customer tier seg-
mentation can be used to guide decisions that affect the tiers differentially,
without explicitly different policies for each tier.
</p>
<p>23.4 Risks in Implementing Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>Customer tier segmentation has gained popularity for many firms that are
concerned about competing for customers, and at the same time, pressured
for marketing funds. The concept is compelling &ndash; focus your limited funds
on your best customers. While this is strong logic, there are certain risks to
customer tier programs, as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Under-serving the lower tier : While hypothetically it is possible that cus-
tomer tier programs should allocate more money to the lower tiers, most
applications and the managerial mindset is to focus dollars on the upper
tiers. The result could be profit losses in the lower tier segments that have
to be offset by the gains in the upper tier. This of course is a natural con-
sequence of shifting funds from one asset to another. However, there are
factors that could make the losses from the lower tiers worse than expected
(Scherreik 2002; Mazur 1999). First, there is some evidence that automated
service systems result in lower loyalty than personal service (Selnes and
Hansen 2001; Ariely et al. 2002). Ariely et al. found in a lab experiment</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>602 23 Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>that customers interacting with a computer-generated advisor were less re-
silient to market crashes. The group that interacted with a human advisor
recovered to its pre-crash level, while the group that interacted with the
computer advisor suffered a permanent downswing in usage. Selnes and
Hansen (2001) found that customers who had personal interactions with a
bank were more likely to form social bonds with the bank, and this in turn
resulted in higher loyalty. Also, self-service interactions improved bonding
if personal-service interactions were also high. These studies suggest that
routing the lower tier customers to automated services may make them
even less profitable than if they are accorded personal service. Second,
Feinberg et al. (2002) demonstrate the betrayal effect, whereby customers
will decrease their preferences for their favorite company if that company
offers special deals to other customers. The case here is a little different &ndash;
the question is whether a firm&rsquo;s bottom tier customers will feel betrayed if
the firm gives special treatment to its top tier customers. However, it would
be important to examine the betrayal effect for customer tier programs.
It may depend in subtle ways on how the tiers are defined. For example,
I may be completely loyal to Airline A although I don&rsquo;t take many trips.
Under Airline A&rsquo;s customer tier program, I may not make the &ldquo;Gold&rdquo; tier
and therefore receive poor service, yet I perceive that I deserve better.
</p>
<p>&bull; Over-serving the higher tier : Funds should be allocated proportional
to the marginal benefit generated by additional allocation. Recalling
the planning models above, where revenues or LTV = α + Xβ . A key
factor in deciding on allocating development funds is β, the marginal
productivity of funds. As a result, firms that define tiers solely based on
current profitability (basically α) and allocate most marketing funds to
the segments with high α&rsquo;s, may be wasting money.
</p>
<p>&bull; Confusing current profit level with responsiveness: Over-serving the higher
tier segment is part of the general problem of confusing level and response.
The problem is that measures on α are more readily available than β.
α can be approximated by current profitability, whereas β requires a
statistical model, survey, or difficult judgments on the productivity of
marketing funds (Rust et al. 1995). In fact, customer tiers should really
be defined based on Fig. 23.7. Figure 23.7 depicts 4 groups according to
the current profit level (α) and responsiveness (β). The high level/high
response group is called the &ldquo;Develop&rdquo; group, since this group merits
significant investment. The high level/low response group is called the
&ldquo;Cash Cow&rdquo; group, since this group requires little investment. The low
level/high response group is called the &ldquo;Move Up&rdquo; group, since this group
can possibly be moved to top tier with appropriate investment. The low
level/low response group is called the &ldquo;Fire&rdquo; group, since these customers
are not valuable and can&rsquo;t be changed.
The problem is that companies define customer tiers based on levels
and then think of all high-level customers as Develop, and all low level
customers as Fire. They can be wasting significant funds on the Cash Cow</p>

group. Of course the problem here is one of measurement &ndash; it is very diffi-
cult to obtain the segment-level β&rsquo;s. However, managers need to be aware
of these issues and researchers need to develop effective ways of estimating
the segment-level β&rsquo;s. This is why Rust et al. work (2000) is so important.
</p>
<p>&bull; Mis-Classifying customers in tiers: As in any segmentation scheme,
companies can mistakenly classify customers in the wrong tiers. This
is especially an issue for acquisition (anticipating in advance whether
a customer will be a top tier customer), if multiple measures are used
for classification, and if not all required data are available from all
customers. The acquisition issue is a key one, since companies do not
want to abandon acquisition efforts altogether. But acquiring the wrong
customers actually can result in lower profits. Ainslie and Pitt&rsquo;s approach
for UniBank is an important contribution here. The idea is to create a
predictive model that identifies top tier customers by predicting scores as
a function of predictors available in acquisition lists. Obviously not a lot
of data are available in these lists, but Ainslie and Pitt (1998) found that
demographic and credit data were valuable predictors. The problem with
using multiple measures is that some customers may be put into the high
tier group since they are like top tier customers on say 3 out of 5 measures.
But those 2 measures in which they are unlike top tier customers may
make them non-receptive to the customer tier program. A customer may
have the income but not the age level to be placed in a company&rsquo;s top
tier. As a result the customer will not be receptive to the appeals designed
for higher income, older people. The missing data issue is also crucial. An
obvious example is missing data on responsiveness, as discussed above.
Another example would be missing data on share-of-wallet. A high profit
level customer with a low share of wallet obviously should be treated
differently than a high profit level customer with a high share of wallet.</p>

<p>604 23 Customer Tier Programs
</p>
<p>23.5 Future Research Requirements
</p>
<p>Research is needed on all aspects of customer tier programs, and can be
organized around the steps in designing these programs shown in Fig. 23.1.
</p>
<p>&bull; Review objectives: For which types of objectives are customer tier programs
best suited? How do different objectives (e.g., emphasis on customer count
and revenues versus emphasis on profitable growth of a stable customer
base) influence the design of programs?
</p>
<p>&bull; Creating databases : How do the information technology costs compare with
the profitability gains from customer tier segmentation?
</p>
<p>&bull; Create segments: What are the best variables for defining customer tiers?
How do we integrate both level and response measures?
</p>
<p>&bull; Determine acquisition potential for each tier : How do we develop segment-
level acquisition functions? How can we identify segment members in ad-
vance of acquisition?
</p>
<p>&bull; Determine development potential within tier : How do we develop the re-
sponse functions for revenues and retention that are the core of what makes
customer tier programs work? While there is some work that suggests cus-
tomers respond to tier programs (Wansink 2003; Kopalle et al. 2006), there
is much more work to be done in this area.
</p>
<p>&bull; Allocate funds to segments: We need to enhance the planning models pro-
posed in Sect. 23.2.7, and show that they can be used to improve customer
tier strategy performance. Can managerial judgment be used to guide these
models (see Blattberg and Deighton 1996; Rust et al. 1995)?
</p>
<p>&bull; Design programs: What types of programs are the best for developing high
tier segments? What programs work for moving customers up? To what
extent should customers be aware of their tier status, and if made aware,
how extensively should this publicly acknowledged?
</p>
<p>&bull; Implement and evaluate: Can product-centric organization structures im-
plement customer tier programs successfully? What is a reasonable ROI
for a customer tier program, including IT and marketing costs?
</p>
<p>In addition, more research is needed on the competitive implications of cus-
tomer tier programs. If customer tier programs entail lower prices for the
upper tiers, where do the increased profits come from? They could come
from selling additional products to those customers. But if the market size
is finite, haven&rsquo;t the same number of firms simply divided the market up at
lower prices and possibly higher costs? For example, the airline industry lav-
ishes a lot of service on its upper tier &ndash; that costs money. What would be the
profit implications of dropping the program? Would costs increase? Why? Is
customer tier management simply a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma whereby firms spend
extra money and offer lower prices to retain their best customers? Or per-
haps the entire movement really isn&rsquo;t a marketing strategy as much as a cost
management strategy.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>23.5 Future Research Requirements 605
</p>
<p>Most importantly, we need convincing controlled field experiments that
demonstrate customer tier programs work. The examples cited above report
sales and profit increases, but they do not report baselines of what would
have occurred without the program. To our knowledge, there is no example of
systematically investigating in a controlled setting the profitability of treating
an upper tier much better than it was treated before, and the potential losses
from treating a lower tier much worse than it was treated before.</p>

<p>Churn Management
</p>
<p>Abstract While database marketing activities such as cross-selling, up-
selling, frequency reward, and customer tier programs focus on developing
the customer, there is always the fear that in the midst of these efforts, the
customer will decide to leave the company, i.e., &ldquo;churn.&rdquo; We discuss the ap-
proaches that can be used to control customer churn, focusing on proactive
churn management, where the customer is contacted ahead of when he or
she is predicted to churn, and provided a service or incentive designed to
prevent the customer from churning. We review predictive modeling of cus-
tomer churn, and present a framework for developing a proactive churn man-
agement program.
</p>
<p>24.1 The Problem
</p>
<p>Using a simple retention model, the lifetime value of a customer is:
</p>
<p>LTV =
&infin;&sum;
t=1
</p>
<p>mtr
t&minus;1
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)t&minus;1
(24.1)
</p>
<p>Customer churn management focuses on the retention component, r. At the
customer level, churn refers to the probability the customer leaves the firm
in a given time period. At the firm level, churn is the percentage of the firm&rsquo;s
customer base that leaves in a given time period. Churn is therefore one
minus the retention rate:
</p>
<p>Churn = c = 1&minus; Retention Rate = 1&minus; r (24.2)
High customer churn is a concern for any industry where a simple reten-
tion lifetime value model is applicable, i.e., where customers can leave and
not naturally return without a significant re-acquisition effort. This includes
many services such as magazine and newsletter publishing, investment ser-
vices, insurance, electric utilities, health care providers, credit card providers,
</p>

<p>608 24 Churn Management
</p>
<p>banking, Internet service providers, telephone service providers, online ser-
vices, and cable service providers.
</p>
<p>There are two major types of customer churn: &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; and &ldquo;invol-
untary.&rdquo; Involuntary churn refers to the company deciding to terminate the
relationship with the company, typically because of poor payment history.
Voluntary churn refers to the customer deciding to terminate the relation-
ship with the company. Hadden et al. (2006) further distinguish between
&ldquo;deliberate&rdquo; voluntary churn, where the customer is dissatisfied or has re-
ceived a better competitive offer, and &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; voluntary churn, where
the customer cancels service because he or she no longer needs the product
or has moved to a location where the company does not offer service.
</p>
<p>Table 24.1 displays reported total churn rates for various industries and
companies. The table shows it is not uncommon for between 20% and 50%
of the customers who begin the year with a company to leave by the end
of the year.1 Table 24.1 suggests two observations: (1) Churn seems to be
decreasing in the US wireless telecom industry.2 This could be due to industry
consolidation as well as better service. (2) Nascent industries such as digital
services have high churn rates. This could be due to competition, poor service,
or using steep promotions to acquire customers.
</p>
<p>A few calculations illustrate the importance of churn rates of the mag-
nitude reported in Table 24.1. First, consider the expected lifetime of the
customer, that is, how long the customer stays with the company. This can
be shown to equal the reciprocal of the churn rate (Appendix 24.1), i.e.,
</p>
<p>Expected Lifetime of Customer =
1
c
</p>
<p>(24.3)
</p>
<p>Figure 24.1 graphs expected lifetime as a function of the churn rate. The
figure shows that if the annual churn rate is 50%, the average customer is
with the company for 2 years. At a 40% churn rate, this becomes 2.5 years;
at 30% it&rsquo;s 3.3 years; and at 20% churn, it&rsquo;s 5 years. So within the range
of the data reported in Table 24.1, a company with a relatively low churn
rate keeps its customers for roughly 2 1/2 additional years compared to a
company with a relatively high churn rate. What&rsquo;s more, the function is
convex: The 20% churn company starts with a customer lifetime of 5 years,
but can move to 6.6 years by decreasing its churn rate by just 5 percentage
points, to 15%. If it can decrease churn all the way to 10%, average customer
lifetime doubles, to 10 years.
</p>
<p>Second, we can look at the lifetime value of the customer. Restating Equa-
tion 24.1 in terms of churn rather than retention, and assuming constant profit
</p>
<p>1 Note that one can extrapolate the monthly churn rates to annual churn rates by cal-
culating 1 &minus; (1 &minus; c)12. This calculation assumes that the customer base on which the
monthly churn rate is calculated retains that same churn rate for 12 consecutive months.
</p>
<p>2 The latest statistics are for &ldquo;post-paid&rdquo; customers, who typically have lower churn levels
than &ldquo;pre-paid&rdquo; customers. But post-paid customers are the dominant customer type. In
addition, Prudential Equity Group (2006) reports that the post-paid churn rate among
</p>
<p>the top four wireless carriers has on average steadily declined since 2002.</p>

<p>per customer (Fitchard 2002; Pierce 2001). Companies then would be making
money, but the 20% churn company has an ROI of ($1, 676&ndash;$400)/$400 =
319%, while the 50% churn company has an ROI of ($891&ndash;$400)/$400 =
123%, which is quite different.
</p>
<p>Figure 24.2 shows a convex relationship between churn rate and lifetime
value &ndash; firms enjoy increasing returns with respect to decreasing churn. A
telecom company with 20% annual churn starts with an LTV of $1,676, but
can increase it to $1,966 by reducing churn to 15%. On a base of 5,000,000
subscribers, that&rsquo;s $1.45 billion in additional profits!
</p>
<p>Of course it is difficult to decrease churn and it costs money, but one
sees the opportunity for increased profits by managing churn effectively, and
conversely, the threat to company viability if churn escalates.
</p>
<p>24.2 Factors that Cause Churn
</p>
<p>The first step toward predicting and remedying churn is to understand the
factors that cause or alleviate it. Table 24.2 provides a categorization of these
factors: customer satisfaction, switching costs, customer characteristics, mar-
keting efforts, and competition.
</p>
<p>More satisfied customers should be less likely to churn, i.e., have higher
lifetime durations (Anderson and Sullivan 1993; Hallowell 1996; Bolton 1998).
In fact, Anderson and Sullivan (1993) found that companies with higher sat-
isfaction levels enjoy lower elasticities of retention with respect to quality,
i.e., these firms are insulated from short-term negative deviations in quality.
There is some evidence that gross measures of overall satisfaction may not
be perfectly predictive of churn (Kon 2004). Therefore, satisfaction should
be measured with respect to particular components of the product, e.g., per-
ceived service quality, whether the product is meeting expectations, how well
the product fits customer needs, and price. Service quality and expectations
are of course fundamental issues in services marketing (Anderson and Sullivan
1993).
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fit-to-needs&rdquo; is another important issue in customer satisfaction. For ex-
ample, when companies use strong promotional incentives for acquisition,
it succeeds in acquiring the customers, but acquires the wrong customers,
i.e., customers for whom this is not really their best choice. Another point
regarding fit-to-needs is the belief that the one-size-fits-all approach to ser-
vices marketing often leads to lack of fit and results in lower satisfaction and
churn. Companies in online retailing, Internet service provision, satellite TV,
telecommunications, news and information, banking, and shipping are trying
to customize their products to the customer to prevent this lack of fit prob-
lem and create customer satisfaction (Verton 2001; Kreitter 2000; Kleinman
2000; Bitner et al. 2000).</p>

<p>Keaveney and Parthasarathy (2001) find intriguing evidence that the infor-
mation source customers use to choose a particular service influences churn.
This is consistent with evidence that acquisition channel is related to cus-
tomer retention (Verhoef and Donkers 2005). Keaveney and Parthasarathy at-
tribute their finding to the influence that information source has on customer
expectations and perceived fit-to-needs. They find that customers are less
likely to churn if they use external or experiential information in making their
choices. This information leads to more accurate expectations, more knowl-
edgeable choice, and a potential bias to confirm the positive &ldquo;priors&rdquo; set up by
the information. However, information from peers was associated with more
churn, since the information provided there is vicarious and less convincing.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, rarely does the database marketer have direct measures
of customer satisfaction. For this reason, prior purchase and usage behavior
variables, which are usually measurable, often serve as surrogates for satis-
faction. Reinartz and Kumar (2003) find that sales volume and cross-buying
are negatively associated with churn,3 while returns and focused buying are
positively associated. Purchase frequency has a U-shaped relationship with
</p>
<p>3 Note cross-buying might also create switching costs, making it less likely the customer
will churn.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24.2 Factors that Cause Churn 613
</p>
<p>churn, with very light and very heavy users having higher churn likelihood.
The light user might be clearly unhappy with the service, while the heavy
users might be so involved in the product that they are more demanding,
hence less satisfied and always on the look-out for a better alternative. Li
(1995) also finds that cross-buying is negatively related to churn but finds
sales volume is positively related.
</p>
<p>As additional indicators of satisfaction, companies sometimes measure pre-
vious customer contacts with the call center, or complaints and objective mea-
sures of customer quality. Hadden et al. (2006) include these variables in a
predictive churn model, and we will discuss the results in Sect. 24.3.1. Cousse-
ment and Van den Poel (2007b) find that the &ldquo;emotionality&rdquo; displayed in cus-
tomer e-mails to the company can be measured and improve churn prediction.
</p>
<p>Switching costs, or the lack of them, are another reason for churn. Switch-
ing costs can take two forms &ndash; psychological and physical &ndash; but both have the
same theme: If it does not cost the customer much to switch to a competitor,
the customer is more likely to churn. Psychological switching costs include
psychological barriers to switching such as inertia, brand pull, familiarity, and
perceptions of a relationship with the current company. Physical switching
costs include real inconveniences due to switching. Consider for example In-
ternet portals. The customer might have invested much effort in customizing
the home page of their chosen portal (e.g., AOL). Switching to a new portal
would require those efforts to be repeated Kolko 2002).
</p>
<p>An interesting natural experiment regarding physical switching costs oc-
curred in the wireless telephone industry, regarding &ldquo;number portability.&rdquo;
Before the fall of 2003 customers who switched carriers would have to change
their telephone numbers as well. As of fall of 2003, customers were allowed
to retain their old numbers. The wireless industry braced for a huge increase
in churn (La Monica 2003). This was supported by a Forrester study (Golvin
2002), which found that 22% of cell-phone users were interested in switch-
ing carriers if they could retain their current phone number, while only 9%
were interested in churning if they could not keep this number. Interestingly,
they found that high volume callers would be the most likely to switch under
number portability. This makes sense in that these customers are spending
much money and looking for a better deal, but without portability, the cost
of switching is enormous because they would have many people to notify of
their new number.
</p>
<p>Figure 24.3 displays customer churn for the six major carriers during the
period when number portability was instituted (November 2003). The results
reveal, quite surprisingly, that churn did not generally increase. The possi-
ble exception is ATT (perhaps not unexpectedly, ATT was later to merge
with Cingular). But besides ATT, the major carriers experienced virtually
no increase in churn.
</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for the lack of churn experienced after
number portability. First, there still may have been switching costs because
the customer would have to purchase a new phone and the new phone would</p>

</p>
<p>need the old number programmed into it. Second, when all is said and done,
customers by November 2003 were not really so dissatisfied with their service
that they wanted to churn (intentions do not always translate into behav-
ior (Morwitz 1997)). Third, companies may have increased marketing efforts
during this period (e.g., see The Economist (2007)).
</p>
<p>Customer characteristics also play a role in churn. Risk takers, variety
seekers, innovators, shopping mavens, and deal prone consumers might be
more likely to churn. Keaveney and Parthasarathy (2001) found that risk
taking was positively related to churn, and churn was also higher for lower
income and lower levels of education. Reinartz and Kumar (2003) found that
rural and higher income customers were less likely to churn. Li (1995) found
that married and higher income customers were less likely to churn, and car
owners and frequent movers were more likely to churn. Hallowell (1996) also
found that higher income customers were less likely to churn. The higher
loyalty from higher income customers may be due to lower price sensitivity.
</p>
<p>Company marketing efforts ideally should have an impact on churn. This
includes special services, loyalty programs, and price. Reinartz and Kumar
(2003) found marketing efforts and loyalty programs associated with lower
churn, although Reinartz and Kumar (2000) found that catalog mailing costs
relative to total sales were not different between long and short lifetime cus-
tomers. Li (1995) found that discount programs were associated with less
churn. One common assumption is that matching the customer to the right
pricing plan (e.g., for telecom) is associated with less churn. However, Lam-
brecht and Skiera (2006) find that customers have a systematic bias toward
selecting a flat rate plan over a pay-per-use plan, even if they would save
money on the pay-for-use plan. What&rsquo;s more, they find that using the flat
fee plan (the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; plan in terms of dollars spent) is not associated with
higher churn. The authors attribute this to an &ldquo;insurance effect&rdquo; desired by</p>

<p>24.3 Predicting Customer Churn 615
</p>
<p>customers. These results caution companies to be careful in encouraging cus-
tomers to adopt new pricing plans to head off churn.
</p>
<p>Competition is the fifth major category of causes for churn. Competition
can come from both within and outside the product category. For example,
dial-up ISP providers need to worry other dial-up providers as well as broad-
band (Kolko 2002). Online bankers have to worry about regular banking
(Ensor 2002). The conventional wisdom is that competitive offers and oppor-
tunities are a major cause of churn (Elstrom 2002; Whiting 2001), but there
has been little empirical verification on this, perhaps due to the fact that a
given company often has little direct information on competitive offers.
</p>
<p>In any given situation, all five factors above may be at work. Consider
for example the Internet Service market. Many companies in this business
relied on ubiquitous promotions and deals to sign up subscribers. Customer
satisfaction and fit-to-needs were not always high, but high switching costs
prevented churn. Many of the first ISP&rsquo;s used dial-up service, which did
not satisfy needs for speed and convenience. So when a competitive cat-
egory (broadband) offered better service, these ISP&rsquo;s developed a signifi-
cant churn problem (Yang 2002). Forrester Research hypothesized that the
&ldquo;savviest&rdquo; users (the market mavens) were most likely to churn (Kolko
2001). This churn problem continued despite ample marketing efforts to
arrest it.
</p>
<p>24.3 Predicting Customer Churn
</p>
<p>A key step in proactive churn management is to predict which customers
are most likely to churn. While predictive models can be developed for this
purpose, their accuracy is hampered by lack of access to direct measures of
the causes for churn. Companies therefore use behavioral measures such as
recency, frequency, and monetary value as surrogates. They may also have
records on customer complaints or previous offers extended to customers, as
well as current prices paid, previous retention efforts, or acquisition source.
They might have good measures of physical switching costs such as number
of products used by the customer. They typically would not have good data
on customer psychographics such as risk-taking, but they often have demo-
graphic measures that can link well to psychographics (e.g., Ailawadi et al.
2001). Finally, they typically have no data on competitive activity.
</p>
<p>There are two types of churn prediction models, &ldquo;Single Future Period&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Time Series.&rdquo; In Single Future Period models, predictors are available
for one or several time periods before the &ldquo;churn period,&rdquo; where we ob-
serve whether or not the customer churned. For example, predictors might
be measured for February and March, and those data are used to predict
whether the customer churns in April. Often a month is skipped between the
predictor and churn periods because it will take a month for the analyst to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>616 24 Churn Management
</p>
<p>predict would-be churners and then contact the would-be churners with an
offer to prevent the customer from churning in the subsequent month.
</p>
<p>Time Series models are based on data where we observe predictors and
churn simultaneously as they occur period to period. So, each customer would
be observed for several periods. Each period potential predictors would be
collected, as well as whether or not the customer churned. Obviously, one still
must use data from period t &minus; 1, t &minus; 2, etc., to predict for period t or later,
but the major difference is that churn is observed over time rather than in a
single future period.
</p>
<p>24.3.1 Single Future Period Models
</p>
<p>An excellent example of a single future period churn model is from the credit
card industry, provided by Advanced Software Applications as a demo for
their ModelMax software.4 This software uses an exploratory/stepwise pro-
cedure to select predictors, and then estimates a neural net to predict the
dependent variable. Predictors were collected for 6 months prior to the tar-
get month when churn was observed. Predictors included demographics (age,
occupation, credit rating), current product ownership (various other services
offered by the bank), and product usage variables (RFM measures such as
number of purchases, credit card balance, purchase amounts, etc.). The usage
variables were calculated for each of the 6 months prior to the churn month.
For example, &ldquo;Credit card balance in month 6&rdquo; refers to the customer&rsquo;s credit
card balance in the month before the churn month. In all, there were 105 po-
tential predictors. The model selected six predictors:
</p>
<p>&bull; Credit card balance in month 6 : Users with low balances are more likely
to churn. It may be difficult for those with high balances to transfer those
balances to a new credit card (a switching cost).
</p>
<p>&bull; Interest charged in month 3 : Customers with low interest charges, but not
zero, are more likely to churn. This may be because such customers view
interest as nuisance charges.
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchase level in month 6 : Customers with low purchase levels are more
likely to churn. This makes sense as these customers are probably less
satisfied with the card, or have in fact adopted a new card and are phasing
out the old one.
</p>
<p>&bull; Household age: Younger customers are more likely to churn. This may be
due to the venturesome nature of younger people in credit card market,
since it is relatively new to them. They are not set in their ways. They are
also more likely to be courted by competitors.
</p>
<p>&bull; Payment year-to-date month 2 : This is an overall measure of monetary
value. The finding is that customers in the mid-range are more likely to
churn. It might be that high-monetary value customers are satisfied with

<p>the card, which is why they use it so much, while it is not worth it for
low-monetary value customers to switch because there is little at stake
(e.g., a low interest rate would not save them much money because their
spending level is low).
</p>
<p>&bull; Cash advances month 4 : Customers who do not use this feature are more
likely to churn. Customers who use the feature may be more satisfied
with their card, or would have a higher switching cost to switch cards
since they&rsquo;d have to learn how to use the cash advance feature with their
new card.
</p>
<p>Figure 24.4 shows the lift chart for this model. It is very strong, with 5.3
to 1 top-decile lift for the 40,000-customer calibration data. There was no
appreciable degradation in prediction on the 10,000-customer validation data.
This performance is much better for example than for the wireless telephone
churn models reported by Neslin et al. (2006a) and discussed later in this
section. There can be a variety of reasons. One could be the relative maturity
of the credit card category, so behaviors are stable and easier to predict.
Obviously, the reason why churn model accuracy differs by category, and
indeed why predictive model accuracy differs by category, is an important
topic for future research.
</p>
<p>Lemmens and Croux (2006) investigate the use of boosting and bagging
(Chapter 19) in predicting churn. They use the same data as those used in
the Teradata Churn Prediction Tournament described subsequently in this
section (Neslin et al. 2006a). The authors show that both boosting and bag-
ging of a decision tree model improve performance significantly over logistic
regression. Since the true churn rate was approximately 2% for these data
(i.e., churn is a &ldquo;rare event&rdquo;, see Chapter 10; Donkers et al. 2003), the au-
thors use choice-based sampling to create a balanced calibration dataset. The</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>618 24 Churn Management
</p>
<p>authors investigate ways to adjust for this when the calibration data model is
applied to holdout data, which reflects the true proportion of churners (2%).
They find a simple intercept correction performs best. The authors find that
how long the customer has owned his or her handset is the most important
predictor of churn. This makes sense. Given the rapid changes in handset tech-
nology and features, customers who have owned the same handset for a long
time are ripe for a competitive offer featuring a new handset if they switch.
</p>
<p>Wei and Chiu (2002) also address the issue of rare events in modeling cus-
tomer churn. In their data, the average monthly churn rate is 1.5&ndash;2%. The
authors develop a &ldquo;multi-classifier class-combiner&rdquo; approach to address this
issue. Say 1:X is the ratio of churners in the sample, i.e., with a 2% churn rate,
1:X = 1:50. The researcher desires a ratio of 1:Y, where Y = 1 means a 50&ndash;50
split between churners and non-churners. The researcher creates X/Y data-
bases as follows. Each database contains all available churners and N/(X/Y)
non-churners. The same churners are used in each sub-database, while the
non-churners are evenly divided among the sub-databases. A model is esti-
mated for each sub-database. Assume that nc1 models predict the customer
will churn, while nc2 models predict the customer will not churn. We predict
the customer is a churner if wnc1 &gt; (1 &minus; w)nc2 , where w is a weight such
that w &isin; [0, 1]. If w = 0.5, the customer is classified as a churner according
to majority rule. If w &gt; 0.5, churn predictions are given heavier weight, and
we are more likely to predict the customer is a churner.
</p>
<p>The authors test various sub-database ratios (1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16) and
compare the false alarm and miss rates for these ratios to a single sample, for
all w&rsquo;s between 0 and 1 in 0.01 increments. The authors find of course that
as w increases, the multi-classifier class-combiner approach has fewer false
alarms (Prob(Not churn | Predict Churn) decreases) but the miss rate is
much higher (Prob(Churn | Predict Not Churn) increases). This is because a
high w &ldquo;biases&rdquo; the method to predict more non-churners. Most importantly,
the multi-classifier class-combiner approach is superior to the single-sample
approach for all sub-database ratios tested. The authors prefer the 1:2 ratio
because it provides a greater spread in miss rates as w varies, giving the
analyst more leeway as to where to establish a cut-off. The comparison to
the single-sample approach is shown in Table 24.3. The results show that for
a given miss rate, the multi-classifier class-combiner yields a lower false alarm

<p>rate, or for a given false alarm rate, it yields a lower miss rate. Depending on
the value of w, the multi-classifier class-combiner method can be superior in
terms of false alarms and miss rates (see the authors&rsquo; graph on p. 108).
</p>
<p>Hadden et al. (2006) demonstrate the use of predictors that, while not
direct measures of satisfaction, are very good surrogates. In particular, the
authors had 24 variables representing &ldquo;Complaints&rdquo; (type, number, etc.),
&ldquo;Repairs&rdquo; (type of problem, how long it took make the repair, etc.), and
&ldquo;Provisions&rdquo; (appointments broken before making the repair, days after the
promised date that the repair was resolved, etc.). The authors do not identify
the industry but state that the company was &ldquo;one of the largest in the world in
its domain,&rdquo; (p. 105), which explains why the company kept such careful data.
</p>
<p>The authors compare neural nets with Bayesian architecture (Li and Wen
2005; Yu and Dayan 2005), neural nets with feed-forward back propagation,
decision trees, and linear regression. The neural nets used all 24 variables
(&ldquo;inputs&rdquo; in neural net parlance) along with two hidden layers (see Chap-
ter 18). The decision tree method used was CART (&ldquo;classification and regres-
sion tree,&rdquo; see Chapter 17) and while all 24 variables were made available, the
final tree utilized only seven variables. To select variables for the regression
model, the authors calculated the standard error rate (total number of errors
divided by total number of classifications) for each of the 24 variables, and
decided to retain 14.
</p>
<p>The authors find that the models differ in accuracy. In their validation
data, 30% of customers were churners; 70% were non-churners. They use a
cut-off for each model&rsquo;s prediction (0.70) to classify customers and the results
are in Table 24.4.
</p>
<p>The NN&ndash;Bayesian model achieved a &ldquo;lift&rdquo; of 70/30 = 2.33 (the customers
it predicted to churn were more than twice as likely to churn as average).
However, the NN&ndash;Bayesian method did little better than average in pre-
dicting a customer was not going to churn, i.e., the lift would be 75/70 =
1.07. Regression and decision trees appear to balance the two errors the
best.
</p>
<p>While, clearly, Complaints, Repairs, and Provisions data are quite useful in
predicting churn, similar to what we observed earlier, there was little overlap
across models in the variables determined to be most important. For example,
neural networks found that &ldquo;resolution time&rdquo; was among the seven most im-
portant variables; none of the other methods found this to be in the top seven.

</p>
<p>This may be because the predictors are highly correlated and in that context,
we might not expect the top seven of 24 variables to have much overlap.
</p>
<p>Hadden et al.&rsquo;s study is important because it shows that data very &ldquo;close&rdquo;
to customer satisfaction &ndash; complaints, repairs, and repair provisions &ndash; have
predictive power. Consistent with this observation, Coussement and Van den
Poel (2007b) find that measures of customer emotionality in e-mails they
send to the firm provide additional predictive power to predicting churn for
newspaper subscriptions. More work is needed to show the incremental con-
tribution of these data over usage history variables typically also used as
surrogates of customer satisfaction.
</p>
<p>Coussement and Van den Poel (2008) compare the accuracy of support
vector machines (SVM), random forests (Breiman 2001; a form of bagging,
see Chapter 19), and logistic regression in predicting churn for a Belgian
newspaper. Their predictor variables include measures of client&ndash;company in-
teractions such as complaint behavior; renewal variables such as whether the
last subscription was renewed before it expired; customer characteristics, and
previous purchase and usage behavior variables such as length of the current
subscription. The authors use two approaches for estimating the SVM, each
differing in the criterion used for a grid search &ndash; one is based on percent-
age correctly classified (PCC) using a threshold; the other is based on the
area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve; see Chapter 11),
which they call AUC. The authors find that random forests perform the best.
The differences do not appear markedly different (top-decile lifts were 4.48 for
logistic, 4.75 for random forests, 4.21 for SVMPCC, and 4.49 for SVMAUC).
However, as we will see in Sect. 24.4.2, differences in lift on the order of a
tenth of a point can have an important impact on the profitability of churn
management programs.
</p>
<p>Neslin et al. (2006a) conducted a &ldquo;churn modeling tournament&rdquo; to in-
vestigate the best ways to predict churn. They made available data from a
wireless service provider to anyone interested in participating in the tourna-
ment. The data consisted of a 100,000-customer calibration dataset including
171 predictors including customer characteristics, previous cell phone usage,
and previous contact variables (calls to the customer care group, etc.). The
data were of the typical single future period format &ndash; the predictors were col-
lected over a 3-month period, then 1 month was skipped, and then churn was
observed in the fifth period. There were two holdout datasets &ndash; one compiled
at the same time as the calibration dataset (&ldquo;current&rdquo; validation data); the
other compiled roughly 3 months later (&ldquo;future&rdquo; validation data).
</p>
<p>The tournament attracted 44 entries from 33 participants. Roughly half
were academics; half were practitioners. The top-decile lift results for the two
validation databases were as follows:
</p>
<p>Validation data Mean Std. Dev Minimum Maximum
</p>
<p>Current 2.14 0.53 1.07 2.90
Future 2.13 0.53 1.19 3.01</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24.3 Predicting Customer Churn 621
</p>
<p>There are two very important conclusions from the above results: (1) There
is wide variation in achieved lift (from roughly 1&ndash;3). This means that method
matters &ndash; not every entry achieved the same lift. We will show how to cal-
culate the importance of lift in financial terms in Sect. 24.4.2. (2) There is
very little fall-off between the current and future validation databases. This
means that the shelf life of a churn prediction model is at least 3 months.
</p>
<p>Perhaps most important is the authors&rsquo; analysis of the methods used to
make the predictions. As discussed in Chapter 10, they use factor analysis to
uncover five general approaches to modeling churn:
</p>
<p>1. Logit : These entrants used logistic regression as the statistical model, ex-
ploratory data analysis (EDA) and stepwise regression for variable se-
lection, and allocated relatively less time to preparing the final prediction
files. Practitioners tended to be more highly associated with this approach.
</p>
<p>2. Decision Tree: These entrants heavily relied on decision trees as the statis-
tical model. They were far less likely to use EDA and stepwise procedures,
but allocated a lot of their time to estimation. This is quite consistent with
the decision tree method, which requires careful pruning, etc., of the de-
cision tree. Users of this approach spent more time in general on the task
and subdivided the calibration data into estimation and holdout samples.
</p>
<p>3. Practical : These entrants did not favor any particular statistical model.
They relied heavily on common sense in selecting variables and allocated
more time than average on downloading data but less time on average
on the entire task. They did not subdivide the data as the Decision Tree
entrants did. Users of this approach tended to be practitioners.
</p>
<p>4. Discriminant : These entrants used discriminant analysis as their statisti-
cal technique. They allowed less time to data cleaning and more time to
estimation, and tended to use many variables in the final model.
</p>
<p>5. Explain: These entrants did not favor any particular statistical model and
tended to explore several statistical techniques. They reported that they
relied on theory, factor analysis, and cluster analysis to selecting vari-
ables, and tended to use fewer variables in their final models. Although
the following is subjective, by their reliance on theory, factor analysis, and
cluster analysis, it is as if these entrants were trying to come up with a
parsimonious explanation of churn as well as trying to predict it.
</p>
<p>The authors found that the Logit and Decision Tree approaches predicted
most accurately, followed by Practical and Explain, with Discriminant lag-
ging behind. But their major message is that predicting churn, as well as
predictive modeling in general, is about much more than the statistical tech-
nique. It entails allocation of time, methods for selecting variables, and details
such as subdividing the calibration data into estimation and holdout sam-
ples. For researchers, this is important because it suggests the importance
of topics such as variable selection and holdout samples, but also the need
to study predictive modeling holistically rather than as a statistical model.
For practitioners, the implications are that logistic and decision tree-based</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>622 24 Churn Management
</p>
<p>approaches can both work well, but require different management. Decision
tree approaches require much time for estimation; hence managers need to
make sure their analysts have sufficient, in fact, more than sufficient, com-
puting power. Logistic tree approaches will probably entail stepwise, so man-
agers need to question analysts as to what variables were omitted and how
this might affect the interpretation of the results.
</p>
<p>This tournament is exciting in its use of a contest to find the best ways to
predict churn, and its drawing on both academics and practitioners. However,
the study has important limitations that suggest future research. First, there
was not ample representation of machine learning techniques. It turns out
that the winning entry was a machine learning version of decision trees, but
there were not many entries like this and no entries of support vector ma-
chines and genetic algorithms, etc. Second, the data were so highly correlated
that the authors could not tease out the individual contribution of statisti-
cal model, time allocation, etc. These variables tended to clump together to
form &ldquo;approaches,&rdquo; and this is instructive. Still, it would be nice to know the
individual contributions of the components of the approaches. Third, other
details such as treatment of missing data could not be explored in depth.
</p>
<p>In summary, the message of Neslin et al. (2006a) is that churn modeling
requires an approach, not just a statistical technique, and that while different
approaches can be successful, not all approaches are successful.
</p>
<p>24.3.2 Time Series Models
</p>
<p>Hazard models provide a particularly attractive method of predicting churn
using time series data (see Chapter 15). Lu (2001) employs a hazard model
estimated using the LIFEREG routine in SAS.5 The model does not allow for
time-varying covariates but the user can assume a parametric baseline hazard
function. This permits a closed form expression for survival probabilities,
which in this case are the probability a customer does not churn up to a
certain number of months from the origin of the data. In this application, Lu
assumed a log-normal distribution for the baseline hazard function.
</p>
<p>Lu collected data on 41,374 customers who were active as of August 2000
and observed over time whether each one churned. Predictors included de-
mographics, internal customer data (RFM type data on call behavior, plus
data on plan type, customer segmentation code, ownership of other company
products, billing disputes, late fee charges, etc.), and customer contact data
(inbound calls to the company&rsquo;s call center and outbound mail contacts with
the customer). These 212 variables were narrowed to 29 by first omitting
variables that did not significantly correlate with churn, and then using a
stepwise procedure.
</p>
<p>5 See also Van den Poel and Larivière (2004) for an application of hazard models to
predicting churn for a financial services company.</p>

<p>24.3 Predicting Customer Churn 623
</p>
<p>Fig. 24.5 Lift charts for hazard churn model depending on time horizon for prediction.
Base churn probabilities were not available, but decile-by-decile lift could be calculated
</p>
<p>from cumulative gains charts that were provided. (From Lu 2001)
</p>
<p>Survival probabilities were calculated to create lift charts, shown in
Fig. 24.5. The figure shows the lift for predicting the probability that a
customer will churn in a given future month &ndash; month 1, 3, or 6. There are
two interesting findings in Lu&rsquo;s lift charts. First, the top decile lift is the
highest for month 1, next highest for month 3, and noticeably lower for
month 6. This may be because the author did not use time varying covariates
(the covariates were defined as of time zero and did not change), and it is
inherently more difficult to predict churn 6 months out than 1 or 3 months
out.6 Second, the top decile lift in month 3 is 3.5 to 1, which is better than
most of the entries in the Teradata Churn Prediction Tournament described
in the previous section (Neslin et al. 2006a), which predicted for month 2.
This better performance may of course be due to the fact that these are
different data. Or it could be due to the hazard model, which makes use of
the time series nature of the data.7
</p>
<p>Yan et al. (2001) propose an interesting approach to time series data that
(1) combines several consecutive windows of data, and (2) can be used even if
the dependent variable is not available for some observations. We discuss the
first feature in more detail since it is more relevant to most churn modeling
situations.
</p>
<p>Assume the company has T +1 &ldquo;windows&rdquo; available, e.g., January&ndash;March
for predictors; April to observe churn would be one window, February&ndash;April
for predictors; May to observe churn would be the next, etc. This is essentially
a time series of observations divided into T +1 databases. A predictive model
</p>
<p>6 Note the 2nd, 3rd, and other deciles look better for the 6-month predictions, but that&rsquo;s
because fewer churners were grouped into the first decile, so they were more likely to
be in other deciles.
</p>
<p>7 Even though in this case the author did not use time-varying predictors, his hazard
model is inherently dynamic due to the log-normal hazard function.</p>

<p>could be estimated for each window, as in the Single Future Period approach.
The prediction works as follows:
</p>
<p>P [c|xi] =
&minus;T&sum;
t=0
</p>
<p>w(t)Pt[c|xi] (24.5)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>xi = Vector of attributes for customer i applicable at the prediction period.
P [c|xi] = Predicted probability customer i churns during the prediction pe-
</p>
<p>riod, given xi.
Pt[c|xi] = Predicted probability customer i churns using the model estimated
</p>
<p>for the tth window, t = 0, . . . ,&minus;T , where t = 0 signifies the most recent
window, and t = &minus;T is the oldest model.
</p>
<p>w(t) = Set of weights.
</p>
<p>and:
</p>
<p>w(t) =
e&minus;σt&minus;1
</p>
<p>Z
(24.6)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>σt&minus;1 = Mean square error using the model t &minus; 1 to predict for model 0&rsquo;s
dataset.
</p>
<p>Z = Normalization constant so that the w&rsquo;s sum to 1.
</p>
<p>The prediction of whether the customer will churn in the current period is a
weighted average of predictive models estimated from previous data windows,
where the weights are proportional to a model&rsquo;s ability to predict the most
recent data window. One would expect the weights to decline as we move
back in time, but the weights are determined empirically by σ. Note this is
very similar to the multi-classifier class-combiner approach of Wei and Chiu
(2002) discussed above. The windows are the sub-samples, and Equations 24.5
and 24.6 describe how the different predictions are combined.
</p>
<p>The authors compare three models: (1) the proposed &ldquo;Combined&rdquo; model
based on three windows, (2) a single model using all the data from four
periods before the prediction period, and (3) a single model based on one
period before the prediction period. Model 2 is similar to a time series model
since customers may churn in each period. Model 3 is similar to the Single
Future Period approach since there is only one period when the customer
might churn. The models are based on between 67,278 and 72,431 customers
per window, and 71 potential predictors (customer credit classifications, lo-
cation, use of various services, monthly service charges, monthly usage rate
of various services, monthly number of dropped calls, and monthly number
of customer service calls, etc.) were derived to predict churn for a 2-month
period during which churn was roughly 6%. All the estimated models were
neural nets with 71 inputs, one hidden layer, and 10 hidden nodes.
</p>
<p>The results were that the Combined model and Model 2 predicted equally
well, and together, both performed better than Model 3. The authors advo-
cate their Combined model over Model 2 because the Combined model has</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>24.4 Managerial Approaches to Reducing Churn 625
</p>
<p>smaller data requirements per model and is easier to estimate and utilize.
This of course depends on the model used for Model 2. It isn&rsquo;t clear that a
Combined model using neural nets for each model would be easier, or supe-
rior, to a hazard model. In any case, Yan et al.&rsquo;s approach is very interesting
and shows the potential of combining models into a single prediction, a theme
that runs throughout the machine learning literature (Chapter 19).
</p>
<p>Bonfrer et al. (2007) propose a Brownian motion model for predicting
customer churn and apply it to a telecom company. The model assumes that
weekly usage rate for customer i(xit) follows a first-order Markov process.
Future usage can be predicted from (1) usage in the previous period, (2) a
drift parameter &micro;i related to the mean of the process, and (3) a volatility
parameter σi related to the standard deviation of the process. Customers
are assumed to churn if they hit zero consumption. If weekly usage follows
a normal distribution, and xit &gt; 0, then the time until the customer churns
follows an inverse-Gaussian distribution, and the cumulative distribution, or
the probability the customer churns within time τ of the current time t can
be written as:
</p>
<p>F (τ |xit, &micro;i, σi) = 1&minus; Φ
(
&micro;it+ xit
σi
&radic;
t
</p>
<p>)
+ exp
</p>
<p>(&minus;2xit&micro;i
σ2i
</p>
<p>)
Φ
(
&micro;it&minus; xit
σi
&radic;
t
</p>
<p>)
(24.7)
</p>
<p>where Φ is the cumulative standard normal distribution. The probability
of churning is increasing in the drift parameter (&micro;) and decreasing in recent
consumption (x). A customer with negative drift and low recent consumption
is a churn candidate. Higher volatility generally signals trouble for a customer
with positive drift, but can actually lessen the chances of churn if drift is
negative. These results make sense.
</p>
<p>Since the model only has two parameters &ndash; drift and volatility &ndash; it can
be estimated at the individual customer level. This makes the model easy
to implement and avoids heterogeneity assumptions. The authors test their
model and find it achieves roughly 2 to 1 top-decile lift in holdout data,
similar to the predictive accuracy found in the churn modeling tournament
discussed in Sect. 24.3.1. Overall, the simplicity and interpretability of the
Brownian motion model makes it a promising method for future application
and development.
</p>
<p>24.4 Managerial Approaches to Reducing Churn
</p>
<p>24.4.1 Overview
</p>
<p>Approaches to reducing churn can be first categorized as targeted or un-
targeted. Untargeted approaches try to increase customer satisfaction or
increase customer-switching costs by improving the product, advertising, or</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>626 24 Churn Management
</p>
<p>using loyalty programs. Targeted approaches, in contrast, identify customers
most likely to churn and attempt to &ldquo;rescue that customer.&rdquo; The key differ-
ence between targeted and untargeted approaches is that the targeted ap-
proaches identify potential churners and take action, whereas the untargeted
approaches do not single out potential churners.
</p>
<p>There are two types of targeted approaches: reactive and proactive. Re-
active approaches wait for the customer to identify him/herself as a likely
churner, usually when the customer calls to cancel service. A proactive ap-
proach identifies, in advance, customers most likely to churn, diagnoses the
reason for the potential churn, and targets an appropriate action or incentive
to induce the customer to stay.
</p>
<p>Reactive churn management programs have the advantage of perfect pre-
diction, or at least near-perfect. The customer has called and is about to
cancel service, and then corrective action is taken. Because of the perfect pre-
diction, the company can afford a significant incentive to keep the customer.
However, at this point a strong incentive is necessary, and the company is
basically bribing the customer to stay. This costs a lot in the short term and
also may &ldquo;train&rdquo; the customer to call whenever he or she has an attractive
competitive offer, expecting the company to match or exceed that offer.
</p>
<p>Proactive churn management programs use predictive models to identify
would-be churners, and hence have imperfect predictive accuracy &ndash; the accu-
racy depends on the quality of the churn model. Even with a 5 to 1 lift ratio, if
the overall churn rate is 2%, only 10% of customers in the high churn segment
are real churners. As a result, the company can&rsquo;t spend as much money per
incentive as in a reactive program, since some of it may be wasted. On the
other hand, the company may not need to spend as much, because things
haven&rsquo;t gotten so bad yet that the customer is walking out the door.
</p>
<p>Another potential concern for proactive churn management programs is
that they might stimulate non-would-be churners to contemplate churning.
Perhaps the customer is identified to be at risk for churning based on a
predictive model, but really wasn&rsquo;t going to churn. However, the proactive
contact and accompanying offer might stimulate &ldquo;need recognition&rdquo; (Engel
et al. 1995, Chapter 5) and set in motion the customer&rsquo;s decision process for
deciding whether to churn. Another way of looking at it is that the customer
had a &ldquo;latent need&rdquo; to churn that was identified by the predictive model,
but it took the proactive contact to enable the customer to recognize that
need. This idea is advanced by Berson et al. (2000, pp. 282&ndash;295), who de-
scribe a UK telecom company case where indeed, the apparent result of a
proactive program was to reduce churn among customers who responded to
an offer designed to reduce churn, but increase churn among those who did
not respond.8

</p>
<p>24.4.2 A Framework for Proactive Churn Management
</p>
<p>The above discussion identifies some of the trade-offs inherent in a proactive
churn management program, e.g., the predictive accuracy of the model, the
effectiveness of the offer, and the potential wastage of offers made to cus-
tomers who weren&rsquo;t going to churn. These issues can be quantified using the
model portrayed in Fig. 24.6, which uses the following quantities:
</p>
<p>N = Total number of customers.
α = The probability a customer is contacted as part of the churn management
</p>
<p>program. For example, if the program is to contact all customers in the
top decile identified by a churn predictive model, then α = 0.10.
</p>
<p>β = The probability the customer is a churner, given the customer is con-
tacted. For example, if all customers in the top decile are contacted and
15% of them are churners, then β = 0.15.
</p>
<p>γ = The probability the customer is rescued, given he or she is a churner. This
is the effectiveness of the incentive. For example, if a would-be churner has
a 50% chance of being rescued by the offer, γ = 0.50.
</p>
<p>ψ = The probability a non-churner takes the incentive. That is, a customer
who isn&rsquo;t going to churn may take the incentive, e.g., if it is a price reduc-
tion or a free gift, ψ could be quite large, possibly 100%.
</p>
<p>∆ = Percentage increase in lifetime value among non-churners who take the
incentive. Although a non-churner has not been prevented from churning,
having received an incentive could increase their retention probability or
their purchase level of the company&rsquo;s services. This could be interpreted
as a &ldquo;delight the customer&rdquo; effect (Rust and Oliver 2000; Hatch 2002).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>628 24 Churn Management
</p>
<p>The free offer is an unexpected surprise, one that enhances the customer&rsquo;s
satisfaction with the company.
</p>
<p>c = Contact cost, i.e., the cost of contacting a customer with a churn man-
agement offer. This might be $0.50 if contact is made by mail.
</p>
<p>δ = Cost of the incentive. If for example the incentive is a free cell phone, δ
would equal the out-of-pocket cost of the cell phone.
</p>
<p>LTV = Lifetime value of the customer. This differs of course by customer.
</p>
<p>Given these definitions, one can calculate the total profit for a proactive
churn management program by summing the appropriate probabilities times
payoffs in Fig. 24.6. The result is:
</p>
<p>Π = N{αβγ(LVC &minus; c&minus; δ) + αβ(1&minus; γ)(&minus;c) + α(1&minus; β)ψ(∆LVC &minus; c&minus; δ)
+α(1&minus; β)(1&minus; ψ)(&minus;c)}
</p>
<p>= Nα{(βγ + (1&minus; β)ψ∆)LVC &minus; δ(βγ + (1&minus; β)ψ)&minus; c} (24.8)
</p>
<p>Equation 24.8 has a simple interpretation. The βγ and (1 &minus; β)ψ∆ terms
within the {} brackets represent the incremental profits of the program.
The βγ term is due to the rescued churners; the (1 &minus; β)ψ∆ term is due
to delighted non-churners. The δ(βγ + (1 &minus; β)ψ) and c terms represent the
incremental costs of the program. The δ(βγ + (1&minus; β)ψ) term represents in-
centive costs, first among churners, then among non-churners. The c term
represents contact costs, which are incurred among all α customers who are
contacted.9
</p>
<p>Equation 24.8 shows how key factors come together to determine the prof-
itability of a churn management campaign. Note for example that if a cus-
tomer&rsquo;s lifetime value is small, Equation 24.8 can easily turn out to be nega-
tive. Similarly, if the rescue probability (γ) is small and we can&rsquo;t assume any
delight effect (∆), the campaign may not be worth it.
</p>
<p>The total investment in the program is α(δ(βγ + (1 &minus; β)ψ)) &minus; c), the
third and fourth terms in Equation 24.8. Equation 24.8 divided by investment
therefore is ROI for the program. One can then set an ROI requirement, say
ROI &gt; ρ and solve for the incentive value δ. This yields the maximum the
firm could spend on an incentive, namely:
</p>
<p>δ &lt;
(βγ + (1&minus; β)ψ∆)LTV &minus; c(1 + ρ)
</p>
<p>(1 + ρ)(βγ + ψ(1&minus; β)) (24.9)
</p>
<p>Figure 24.7 graphs maximum allowable incentive (δ) as a function of pre-
dictive accuracy (β) for two different values of incentive effectiveness (γ),
assuming c = $0.50, LTV = $2, 000, required ROI = ρ = 15%, non-churner
</p>
<p>9 Note we are assuming that the only cost among non-churners who do not accept the
offer is the contact cost. If as in the UK telecom case described by Berson et al. (2000),
churn rates actually increase among this group, the cost will be higher than the contact
cost. Importantly, Fig. 24.6 provides a framework that with some extension could be
used to analyze the impact of this possibility.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 24.7 Maximum possible incentive as function of churn model accuracy (β) and re-
tention (Rescue) effectiveness (γ).
Calculations based on Equation 24.9 with c = $0.50, LTV = $2, 000, ρ = 0.15, ∆ = 0.01,
</p>
<p>and ψ = 100%.
</p>
<p>acceptance rate ψ = 100%, and delight effect ∆ = 1%. The figure shows
that given these parameters, one can spend more money on incentives to the
extent that the churn model is more accurate and that would-be churners
respond to the incentive.
</p>
<p>For example, if, 5% of the customers in the targeted group were churners
(β = 0.05), and the rescue rate from the program is 50% (γ = 0.50), the
company could afford to spend $61.03 per customer in a churn management
program. Even though the lifetime value of the customer is $2,000, the com-
pany can only afford to spend much less than that per customer, because of
low predictive accuracy and because only half the churners will be swayed by
the incentive. Of course, the rescue parameter γ is really a function of δ, and
one could incorporate this explicitly as well.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the positive relationship between predictive accuracy and
profit in Fig. 24.7 does not hold in general. For example, taking the deriva-
tive of Equation 24.8 with respect to predictive accuracy β yields (γ&minus;ψ∆) &gt; 0
as a necessary condition for increased accuracy to improve profits. If many
non-churners take the incentive, and doing so delights them, we are bet-
ter off targeting non-churners with the incentive, i.e., having poor pre-
dictive accuracy. This highlights the importance of the delight phenom-
enon and the need to understand its magnitude in a churn management
context.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>630 24 Churn Management
</p>
<p>Neslin et al. (2006a) show how the framework also allows one to calculate
the financial value of predictive accuracy. For simplicity and to be conserva-
tive, they assume ψ = 1 (i.e., all contacted customers accept the incentive)
and ∆ = 0 (there is no delight effect). Then, they express predictive accuracy
β as a function of lift (Chapter 10) as follows: Let β0 be the base churn rate
in the data, and λ be the lift among the customers contacted by the churn
management program. Then β = λβ0. Substituting this into Equation 24.8
and re-arranging terms, they obtain:
</p>
<p>Π = Nα{[γLTV + δ(1&minus; γ)]β0λ&minus; δ &minus; c} (24.10)
</p>
<p>The terms in front of the lift parameter (λ) are the slope of profits with
respect to predictive accuracy. That is,
</p>
<p>GAIN = Nα{[γLTV + δ(1&minus; γ)]β0} (24.11)
</p>
<p>represents the impact on profits of increasing lift by one unit. For example,
consider a campaign with the following parameters:
</p>
<p>N = 5, 000, 000 customers
α = 0.10 (10% of the customer base is to be contacted)
LTV = $500 (lifetime value of rescued customer)
γ = 0.10 (10% of contacted would-be churners stay with the company)
δ = $50 (incentive cost)
β0 = 0.018 (base monthly churn rate)
</p>
<p>Then, the gain in the profitability of a single churn management campaign,
per half unit increase in lift (e.g., from 2.5 to 3.0; note 0.5 is the standard
deviation in performance among the entries in Neslin et al.&rsquo;s churn mod-
eling tournament), is 5, 000, 000 &times; 0.10 &times; {[0.10 &times; $500 + $50 &times; (1 &minus; 0.10)]
&times; 0.018 = $427, 500. As we see, the framework can illustrate the profit im-
pact of better churn prediction, and in this example, we see that the impact
can be substantial.
</p>
<p>The framework integrates key concepts of churn predictive accuracy, incen-
tive effectiveness, delight effects, lifetime value, and costs into an expression
for the profitability of a proactive churn management program. The model
provides diagnostics regarding the maximum a company could spend on an
incentive, which increases as:
</p>
<p>&bull; Predictive accuracy (β) increases (as long as (γ &minus; ψ∆) &gt; 0; see above).
&bull; Incentive effectiveness (γ) increases.
&bull; Lifetime value of customers (LTV ) increases.
&bull; The impact of the incentive on churners (the delight factor ∆) increases.
&bull; Contact costs (c) decrease.
&bull; Required ROI from the program decreases.
</p>
<p>In addition, the framework can be used to calculate the benefits of improved
churn prediction. This is important for a firm that needs to decide whether to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24.4 Managerial Approaches to Reducing Churn 631
</p>
<p>invest in expanding its churn analytics department or purchasing additional
data.
</p>
<p>An important limitation of the framework is that it is a single-campaign
model. It does not explicitly answer questions such as how soon before the
customer is predicted to churn should the customer be contacted, or how
many times to contact a customer.
</p>
<p>24.4.3 Implementing a Proactive Churn
Management Program
</p>
<p>Implementing a proactive churn management program consists of four steps:
(1) identifying potential churners, (2) understanding why they might churn,
(3) designing an appropriate contact/offer strategy for the churners, and (4)
monitoring and evaluating results.
</p>
<p>The first two steps can be accomplished by a predictive model. The pre-
dictive model identifies the customers most likely to churn, and provides
diagnostics for why they might churn. The third step requires creativity to
consider the various incentives that one might implement. Inevitably this
will entail costs, and the framework in Fig. 24.6 can help identify the upper
bound of how much one can spend on incentives. As Equation 24.9 shows, one
will spend more for higher lifetime value customers. Another consideration
here is that the incentive should be such that it does not stimulate &ldquo;need
recognition&rdquo; among those who do not accept the offer (Berson et al. 2000).
</p>
<p>Another important challenge is to decide how many customers to contact,
i.e., what should be the value of α? This could be decided in two ways. First
would be to use a budget. If $X are allocated to the campaign and we antic-
ipate the values for rescue (γ), predictive ability (β), contact cost (c), and
non-churner acceptance (ψ), total expenditures are Nα{(βδ+(1&minus;β)ψ)+ c}.
One can adjust α so that the total expenditure is within budget. Second
would be to quantify the relationship between α and β: β is the percentage of
contacted customers who are would-be churners, and will naturally decrease
as a function of the number of customers contacted (since we are using a
predictive model to identify churners and ordering customers in terms of their
likelihood of churning). One could then calculate profits of the campaign for
different combinations of α and β and choose the combination that maximizes
profits.
</p>
<p>Evaluating a churn management program is best accomplished using a
field test. For example, estimating the rescue rate γ is challenging because
rescued churners cannot be identified with certainty. Following is how a field
test based on the framework in Fig. 24.6 could be used for this purpose. Let
</p>
<p>A = Group that receives the churn offer (treatment group).
B = Group that does not receive the offer (control group).
N = Number of customers assigned to each group (assumed equal).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>632 24 Churn Management
</p>
<p>Rg = Churn rate in group g during the churn management campaign (either
A or B).
</p>
<p>O = Number of offers accepted in the treatment group.
LTVg = Average lifetime value per customer in group g calculated a reason-
</p>
<p>able amount of time after the campaign is finished.
</p>
<p>The impact of the program would be estimated by N(LTVA &minus; LTV B). To
estimate the rescue rate, we express the churn rates in each group as:
</p>
<p>RA = β(1&minus; γ) (24.12a)
RB = β (24.12b)
</p>
<p>Using β from the control group, we can solve Equation 24.12a for the rescue
rate γ. Also, the total number of offers accepted in the treatment group equals
the number of would-be churners who accept plus the number of non-would-
be churners who accept. This yields:
</p>
<p>O = N{βγ + (1&minus; β)ψ} (24.12c)
</p>
<p>Since we know N , β and γ, we can solve for ψ.
This illustrates how a field test can be used to provide an overall evaluation
</p>
<p>of a churn management campaign. In addition, the test provides estimates
for key parameters such as the rescue rate to be used for future planning.
Providing an overall evaluation is crucial; one cannot take for granted that the
churn management program will work. As discussed earlier regarding the UK
telecom case (Berson et al. 2000), it is even possible for N(LTV A &minus; LTV B)
to be negative!
</p>
<p>Another issue in implementing a proactive churn program is how early to
intervene.10 This may require a trade-off between churn model accuracy (β)
and rescue effectiveness (γ). Earlier intervention may rescue more would-be
churners (higher γ), but predictive accuracy will be lower (see discussion of
Lu 2001 in Sect. 24.3.2). Intervening later might benefit from higher model
accuracy, but a rescue offer may be less effective or have to be more costly to
achieve a desired rescue level (γ). The point is, the question is not only what
the churn management offer should be, but when it should be delivered.
</p>
<p>A final issue is the single campaign versus multiple contact approach. For
example, consider the customer who receives an offer in March and does
not churn, but appears in the top decile risk group in May. Should that
customer receive a second incentive in May? There may be a chronically
high churn risk group for the company, and under this policy, they will be
receiving offers every few months. This could erode their profitability, or
at least their loyalty, as we train them that they can always expect new
offers and deals from the company. One way investigate this would be to
include previous churn rescue offers in the predictive churn model. This would

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>24.5 Future Research 633
</p>
<p>tell managers whether previous offers enhance or diminish long-term loyalty.
Another approach would be to formulate and implement an optimal contact
model (Chapter 28). In this model, the current period decision to offer an
incentive to a would-be churner would take into account the future impact
of that offer.
</p>
<p>24.5 Future Research
</p>
<p>We have discussed the churn problem, its causes, how predictive models can
identify churners and diagnose the reasons they churn, and how companies
can manage churn. There are many exciting findings and methods developed
to address this topic, but there are several avenues for future research on
churn, as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Predicting churn: What are the key variables? Which models work best?
How high a lift is feasible and how does it vary by product category?
</p>
<p>&bull; Churn programs: We need field tests to show that churn management
programs can work.
</p>
<p>&bull; Profitability framework : We need parameter estimates of the framework
in Fig. 24.6 so that we can understand the factors that feed into churn
program profitability, and how they vary by program and product category.
</p>
<p>&bull; Dynamic optimization: We need a optimal contact model to decide which
customers should be contacted when, on an ongoing basis, to minimize
churn. This would take into account the impact of current incentives on
future responsiveness, lifetime value, and churn likelihood. This would be
a substantial contribution to the literature and to the practice of effective
churn management.</p>

<p>Abstract Nowhere is the potential &ndash; and challenge &ndash; for database marketing
more acute than in the &ldquo;brave new world&rdquo; of multichannel customer manage-
ment. Whereas many companies historically interacted with their customers
through one channel &ndash; the bricks-and-mortar retail store, the bank branch,
the company catalog, the financial advisor &ndash; today almost all companies are
multichannel. This gives rise to several key questions and management is-
sues; for example, &ldquo;Is the multichannel customer a better customer?&rdquo; &ldquo;If so,
why?&rdquo; &ldquo;Should we encourage our customers to be multichannel?&rdquo; We have
just begun to understand questions such as these, and this chapter reviews
what we know and do not know. We discuss the multichannel customer in
depth, including the association between multichannel usage and sales vol-
ume. We also discuss the factors that influence customers&rsquo; channel choices,
the phenomenon of research shopping and the impact of channel introduc-
tions on firm revenues. We present a framework for developing multichannel
customer strategies, and conclude with industry examples of multichannel
customer management.
</p>
<p>One of the most promising applications for database marketing is the man-
agement of customers over multiple marketing channels. These channels
include the Internet, call centers, sales forces, catalogs, retail stores, and
in the near-future, interactive television. Neslin et al. (2006b, p. 96) de-
fine multichannel customer management as &ldquo;the design, deployment, and
evaluation of channels to enhance customer value through effective cus-
tomer acquisition, retention, and development.&rdquo; As Neslin et al. note, mar-
keters have always considered channel management to be a fundamen-
tal component of the marketing mix (e.g., Stern and El- Ansary 1972;
Webster 1991). However, while traditional channel management has taken
the perspective of the firm (Rangaswamy and Van Bruggen 2005), multi-
channel customer management centers on the customer, on the creation of

<p>customer value as a means to increase firm value (Payne and Frow 2005;
Boulding et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>25.1 The Emergence of Multichannel
Customer Management
</p>
<p>25.1.1 The Push Toward Multichannel
</p>
<p>Company adoption of multichannel customer strategies has been driven by
company, customer, and competitive forces. Companies have developed en-
hanced technological capabilities, particularly in data management and the
Internet. The Internet has created an entirely new channel; one that natu-
rally links to other channels. For example, customers can research products
on the Internet and purchase them in the store (see Sect. 25.2.5).
</p>
<p>Customers have rapidly expanded their channel experiences beyond the
traditional store or sales call. They are also comfortable with catalogs, the
Internet, ATM&rsquo;s, and call centers. They therefore expect companies to have
a presence in all these channels.
</p>
<p>Lastly is the impact of competition. Driven by company and customer
factors, Company A initiates a multichannel strategy, and Company B has
to follow suit. Whether this precipitates a Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma is a major
issue (see Sect. 25.3.3.1).
</p>
<p>25.1.2 The Pull of Multichannel
</p>
<p>Companies have also been pulled toward multichannel management by poten-
tial improvements in loyalty, sales growth, and efficiency. Loyalty may benefit
from increased satisfaction or higher switching costs. Sales may grow simply
because the brand is more available. See Sect. 25.2.2.2 on sales growth and
Sect. 25.2.7 on loyalty.
</p>
<p>The promise of improved efficiency is driven by the Internet and call cen-
ters (see Sect. 25.3.4.1). Both channels are highly automated and may seem
antithetical to enhancing customer relationships. However, the choice may
not be between personal and automated contact, but rather, between au-
tomated or no contact. The customer&rsquo;s need for company contact has risen
dramatically. Consider the multitude of features that now accompany a cell
phone. These stimulate customers to contact the company, to inquire about a
feature or determine why it isn&rsquo;t working. The challenge is to develop effective
yet low-cost channels for dealing with this skyrocketing demand for service.</p>

<p>25.2 The Multichannel Customer
</p>
<p>25.2.1 A Framework for Studying the Customer&rsquo;s
Channel Choice Decision
</p>
<p>Figure 25.1 presents a framework for studying the customer channel choice
decision. The framework weds the customer&rsquo;s decision process (Engel et al.
1995; Peterson et al. 1997) with the firm&rsquo;s marketing efforts (see also Neslin
et al. 2006b). The customer recognizes a need, searches for information for
a product that addresses the need, purchases the product, and then seeks
after-sales service. Along the way, the customer can access various channels at
various companies. The process is guided by the customer&rsquo;s attitudes toward
the various channels, by the firms&rsquo; marketing efforts, and by the outcomes of
previous stages in the process. Finally, the customer evaluates the experience
and updates his/her attitudes.
</p>
<p>For example, stimulated by a Sony advertisement, a customer realizes
he/she might want a high-definition television (HDTV). The customer re-
quires information, and accesses Circuit City&rsquo;s and Best Buy&rsquo;s websites. Now
the customer can talk intelligently to an expert. The customer decides to
visit a store to gather more information, and chooses Best Buy because the
store is closest. Now the customer knows what kind of HDTV he or she
wants. Having recently seen a Wal-Mart ad claiming brand-name HDTVs
at lower prices, the customer goes to Wal-Mart and purchases the product.
After purchasing the HDTV, the customer has trouble installing it and goes
back to Wal-Mart for help. Finally, the HDTV is successfully installed and
the customer evaluates the process. One sees in this example the complexity</p>

<p>of the process, the choice between channel and firm, and the dynamics of
search &rArr; purchase &rArr; after-sales.
</p>
<p>Figure 25.2 compares B2B customer preference for the Internet versus tele-
phone for various stages of the buying process (IOMA 2002). The search stage
is divided into &ldquo;learning&rdquo; and &ldquo;shopping.&rdquo; Learning is gathering information
about general product attributes. Shopping is specifying exactly what prod-
uct is wanted at what price. The Internet excels on learning and after-sales;
the telephone is preferred for shopping and actual purchase. The figure is
clear evidence that customers prefer different channels for different stages of
the decision process (see also Verhoef et al. 2007).
</p>
<p>25.2.2 Characteristics of Multichannel Customers
</p>
<p>25.2.2.1 Demographic and Psychographic Characteristics
</p>
<p>Individual difference variables have been shown to describe customers who
use multiple rather than single channels. Ansari et al. (2008) found the mul-
tichannel shopper to be younger and higher income. Kumar and Venkatesan
(2005) found that customer size and annual sales, purchase frequency, tenure
as a customer, number of customer-initiated contacts, and the level of cross-
buying were positively associated with multichannel usage. In addition, the
number of returns had an inverse U-shaped relationship to multichannel us-
age. These findings show that multichannel shoppers have different personal
characteristics than single-channel shoppers.
</p>
<p>25.2.2.2 Purchase Volume and Profitability
</p>
<p>An emerging generalization in multichannel research is that multichannel
shoppers purchase higher volumes (Neslin et al. 2006b). Figure 25.3 shows</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.2 The Multichannel Customer 639
</p>
<p>Fig. 25.3 Channel usage and purchase volume (From Retailer A: DoubleClick 2004a;
Retailer C: Thomas and Sullivan 2005a).
</p>
<p>the evidence for two US retailers. Note, it may not be that every multi-
channel combination exceeds every single channel, but the customer who
purchases from channels A and B purchases more than the customer who
purchases only from channel A or B. Further evidence on the association
between multichannel buying and purchase volume can be found in Kumar
and Venkatesan (2005), Myers et al. (2004, p. 1), Kushwaha and Shankar
(2005), and Ansari et al. (2008). One interesting exception to this gen-
eralization is the work of Campbell and Frei (2006). These authors find
that adoption of online banking is associated with higher transaction vol-
ume, but a net decrease in revenues, which they conjecture may be due
to customers managing their balances more effectively and avoiding various
fees.
</p>
<p>There are three reasons why the multichannel customer might buy more:
(1) loyalty, (2) self-selection, and (3) marketing. Identifying which of these
explanations applies is very important because of the implications for whether
companies should encourage customers to be multichannel.
</p>
<p>The loyalty explanation is that purchasing from multiple channels in-
creases customer service and satisfaction, resulting in higher loyalty to the
firm and therefore higher sales volume. Another possibility is that the mul-
tichannel customer purchases more products from the company and hence
would incur higher switching costs for leaving. If higher loyalty is indeed a
natural consequence of multichannel usage, this would favor companies en-
couraging customers to become multichannel.
</p>
<p>The self-selection explanation is that high volume customers have more
complex needs and more purchase occasions, so naturally use more channels.
Self-selection says that multichannel does not grow the business &ndash; it sim-
ply allows high-volume customers to purchase from more convenient outlets.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>640 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>Self-selected multichannel shopping may still increase profits if it decreases
costs, e.g., as customers spend more time on the Internet.
</p>
<p>The marketing explanation works in three ways: First, multichannel cus-
tomers may receive more marketing because they are higher volume and hence
targeted with more marketing. If this is the case, whether multichannel should
be encouraged depends on customer response to marketing. Second, the mul-
tichannel customer may be exposed to more marketing as a consequence of
being multichannel. The customer who only uses the firm&rsquo;s retail store is
exposed to in-store merchandising, whereas the customer who uses the firm&rsquo;s
store and catalog is also exposed to the advertising value of the catalogs.
Third, multichannel is a form of increased distribution and hence makes the
company&rsquo;s products more easily available. If increased marketing occurs as
a consequence of multichannel shopping or availability, then multichannel
shopping should be encouraged.
</p>
<p>Ansari et al. (2008) support the marketing explanation. They find that
multichannel customers receive more marketing and are more responsive to
it. They find that using the Internet is associated with lower, not higher, pur-
chase frequency in the long run. They also find that at the beginning of their
data, the customer group that eventually became multichannel was equal in
purchase volume to the group that stayed single channel. These results tend
to refute the loyalty and self-selection hypotheses. Hitt and Frei (2002), how-
ever, support the self-selection hypothesis. They find that while customers
who adopt online banking (and presumably are multichannel) acquire new
products at a faster rate, the magnitude is only about 10% of the overall dif-
ference between online and offline customers (p. 746). The authors conjecture
that self-selection therefore plays a large roll in differences between on and
offline customers.
</p>
<p>A related issue is the relationship between multichannel behavior and cus-
tomer profitability. Three studies have investigated this.
</p>
<p>Venkatesan et al. (2007) use a two-equation model where the first equation
regresses current period customer profits versus lagged multichannel purchas-
ing. The second equation regresses the probability of being a multichannel
shopper versus lagged multichannel purchasing. Their results are that the co-
efficient for lagged multichannel shopping in the first equation is statistically
significant and positive.
</p>
<p>Hitt and Frei (2002) and Campbell and Frei (2006) analyze the impact of
adoption of online banking services. Hitt and Frei (2002) use cross-sectional
analyses to infer that online customers are more profitable than their offline
counterparts. Campbell and Frei (2006) analyze per-period data of banking
customers over an 18-month period. They find that online customers increase
the number of transactions after adoption. These customers substitute online
transactions for ATM and automated as well as human call-center transac-
tions, but slightly increase their usage of the bank branch. The net increase in
transactions, however, results in increased costs. The authors then find that
revenues actually decrease, as reported earlier. The net result is a decrease</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.2 The Multichannel Customer 641
</p>
<p>in profits. However, the authors find that online adoption leads to higher
retention rates, so the net result may be higher customer lifetime value.
</p>
<p>Clearly more work is needed to sort out why the multichannel shop-
per is higher volume, and ultimately, whether adoption of new channels
yields more profitable customers. There are challenging methodological issues
(Sect. 25.2.4.3), and we need to gather more empirical evidence to generalize
the initial findings reviewed above.
</p>
<p>25.2.3 Determinants of Channel Choice
</p>
<p>25.2.3.1 Overview
</p>
<p>Much work has been conducted on the determinants of channel choice.
Figure 25.4 draws on Neslin et al. (2006b) to list six major determinants:
(1) marketing, (2) channel attributes, (3) social influence, (4) channel inte-
gration (5) situational factors, and (6) individual differences. We review what
is known about these determinants.
</p>
<p>25.2.3.2 Individual Differences
</p>
<p>As reported by Neslin et al. (2006b), several individual difference vari-
ables are associated with channel choice, including age, gender, education,
income, family size, and region (Ansari et al. 2008; Gupta et al. 2004b;
Inman et al. 2004; Kushwaha and Shankar 2005; Verhoef et al. 2007). In-
terestingly, Thomas and Sullivan (2005b) find that stage in the customer
lifecycle determines channel choice.
</p>
<p>Another important individual-difference variable is channel experience.
Montoya-Weiss et al. (2003), Inman et al. (2004), and Ansari et al. (2008)
find that experience in using a particular channel makes it more likely the
customer will use that channel in the future. Whether this is due to mindless
inertia or to cognitive learning has not been explored.
</p>
<p>Ward (2001) provides a theory for the role of channel experience. He pro-
poses that customers make human capital investments in learning to use
particular channels. If the skills gained through these investments &ldquo;spillover&rdquo;
to other channels, customers can become multichannel users. For example, a
skill in using a catalog is the ability to determine the best product without
actually touching it. This skill spills over to using the Internet, and as a
result, the catalog and Internet become substitutes.
</p>
<p>To measure spillover, Ward obtains data on customer purchases, by chan-
nel, in several product categories. The author estimates an equation of the
customer&rsquo;s propensity to purchase a category in each channel as a function
of channel-specific and category-specific dummies. The residuals from these</p>

</p>
<p>regressions represent effects that cause deviations from which channel we
would expect the customer to use on average. By correlating these residuals
between channels, the author estimates spillover.
</p>
<p>The results suggest that the spillover effects are largest between online and
direct marketing. The spillover between retail and direct or between retail
and online is lower. However, there is somewhat more spillover between retail</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.2 The Multichannel Customer 643
</p>
<p>and direct than retail and online. Overall, Ward&rsquo;s work is quite interesting
because it provides theory as to why certain channels might be substitutes
for each other.
</p>
<p>25.2.3.3 Situational Factors
</p>
<p>Neslin et al. (2006b) cite five situational factors suggested by Nicholson et al.
(2002): (1) physical setting (e.g., weather), (2) social setting, (3) temporal
issues (time of day, urgency of the purchase, (4) task definition (e.g., type
of product), and (5) antecedent state (e.g., mood). Neslin et al. note that
particular attention has been devoted to task definition, hypothesizing for
example that experience goods are more likely to be purchased at a store,
while search goods are more likely to be bought on the Internet (Mathwick
et al. 2002), and customizable products are more likely to be purchased on
the Internet (Mahajan et al. 2002).
</p>
<p>25.2.3.4 Channel Integration
</p>
<p>Integrated channels make it easy for the customer to choose whichever chan-
nel is more convenient under the circumstances. Companies can enhance this
effect through incentives and their design of the channels. Neslin et al. (2006b)
cite the case where the Internet includes store locators and in-store pick-up
that allow the customer to search on the Internet but make the purchase at
the store.
</p>
<p>Bendoly et al. (2005) survey customers regarding their perceptions of
whether channels were integrated, and their use of the Internet and the retail
store. They identify two types of integration &ndash; information integration, such
as advertising local stores on the Internet, and physical integration, such as
purchases made via the Internet being returnable at the store. The authors
found these dimensions interacted with perceived product availability. For
example, if the product was perceived as available at the store, and the store
and Internet were perceived as being integrated, the customer was more likely
to purchase the product on the Internet. These results suggest that to the
extent channels are integrated, they are perceived as equally desirable for
purchase. This shows how integrated channels breed multichannel shopping.
</p>
<p>25.2.3.5 Social Influence
</p>
<p>The theory of reasoned action (e.g., Fishbein and Azjen 1975; Sheppard et al.
1988) suggests that consumers make decisions based not only on their own
perceptions of the decision, but their perceptions of whether peers, friends,
spouses, etc. perceive the decision is a good one, and whether these others&rsquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>644 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>opinions matter to the decision-maker. Accordingly, one would expect that
channel usage would depend on the influence of significant others.
</p>
<p>This has been verified. Keen et al. (2004) utilized &ldquo;Norm&rdquo; as a factor in
a conjoint analysis of channel choice. Norm was defined at two levels (&ldquo;85%
of people important to you have made an online purchase like this,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;5% . . . &rdquo;). The authors found that Norm was an important factor in channel
choice, although channel format and price were most important. Verhoef et
al. (2007) modeled customers&rsquo; channel preferences as a function of several at-
tributes, including &ldquo;Clientele&rdquo; &ndash; the belief that the customer&rsquo;s acquaintances
used the channel. The authors found that Clientele particularly influenced
customers&rsquo; choice of the Internet. This makes sense in that the Internet is a
new channel and one would expect consumers to model their behavior after
peers when they personally have less experience. It also could relate to the
&ldquo;community&rdquo; concept behind the Internet. Nicholson et al. (2002) found in
an ethnographic study that a mother decided to purchase a gift for her child
at a store rather than the Internet because the effort in using the store was
consistent with the mother&rsquo;s devotion to her child.
</p>
<p>25.2.3.6 Channel Attributes
</p>
<p>As Fig. 25.4 shows, perceived channel attributes play an important role in
channel choice. This follows from the theory of reasoned action. Neslin et
al. (2006b) cite several papers that investigate these attributes, including
Keen et al. (2004), Nicholson et al. (2002), Burke (2002), Montoya-Weiss
et al. (2003), Kacen et al. (2003), Teerling and Huzingh (2005), Jing and
Rosenbloom (2005), Thomas and Sullivan (2005b), Ancarani and Shankar
(2004), Tang and Xing (2001), Morton et al. (2001), Pan et al. (2002a),
Gupta et al. (2004b), Inman et al. (2004), Kushwaha and Shankar (2005),
and Verhoef et al. (2007) (see also Teerling 2007). As Fig. 25.4 shows, the list
of potential attributes is long and varied.
</p>
<p>Figure 25.5, from Verhoef et al. (2007), shows how the Internet, Store, and
Catalog are &ldquo;positioned&rdquo; in terms of customer perceptions of 15 attributes.
The store is strong on lack of risk, service, assortment, and after-sales support.
It is also strongly positioned on privacy. The Internet excels on search conve-
nience and information comparison, but lags on service, privacy, after-sales
support, and risk. The catalog is similar to the Internet, not as convenient
but without the privacy concerns. The privacy result is interesting. The cat-
alog is not anonymous, especially when used for purchase. However, the lack
of privacy is transparent. The catalog buyer knows the firm knows who they
are; with the Internet, there is no telling who is monitoring one&rsquo;s actions.
</p>
<p>Figure 25.6 shows attribute importances inferred by Verhoef et al. by a
regression of overall attitude versus attribute perceptions. Attributes differ
markedly in their importance and importance differs by channel. Pur-
chase risk, after-sales support, assortment, and enjoyment are important</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.2 The Multichannel Customer 645
</p>
<p>Fig. 25.5 Attribute positioning of channels (From Verhoef et al. 2007).
</p>
<p>determinants of attitudes toward using the Internet for purchase, whereas
negotiation opportunity and purchase effort are less important. Privacy is
an important attribute for using the Internet for purchase, but less so for
the catalog and of no concern for the store. The Internet and catalog are
more &ldquo;attribute-driven&rdquo; than the store. In Verhoef et al.&rsquo;s sample, customers
had uniformly high attitudes toward the store, perhaps due to an experience
&ldquo;halo&rdquo;.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>646 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>Fig. 25.6 Attribute importances for search and purchase (From Verhoef et al. 2007).
&lowast; Signifies that the attribute is reverse-coded. That is, purchase risk has a negative impact
on channel choice, as does purchase effort. Privacy concern has a negative impact for
Internet and catalog; the impact for store is nominally positive, but was not statistically
significant.
</p>
<p>In summary, channels are &ldquo;positioned&rdquo; much in the way products are. An
extension of the Verhoef et al.&rsquo;s research would be to create a positioning
map for each channel, for each decision stage, for each firm.
</p>
<p>25.2.3.7 Marketing
</p>
<p>Recent work has verified that marketing can drive channel choice. Thomas
and Sullivan (2005a) found that direct marketing influenced choice of store,
catalog, or Internet. They found two segments. For one segment, direct
marketing expenditures migrated customers to the Internet at the expense
of the store. For the other segment, direct marketing expenditures moved
customers to the store rather than the Internet. The main finding is that</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.2 The Multichannel Customer 647
</p>
<p>marketing determines migration, and segments respond differently, even in
opposite directions. Ansari et al. (2008) reach the same conclusion.
</p>
<p>Venkatesan et al. (2007) studied the time it took customers to adopt new
channels, given they had bought earlier from another channel. They found
that marketing communications (direct mail and e-mail) had an inverse U-
shaped relationship with the timing of new channel adoption. Up to a point,
increasing communications would shorten the time till adoption; however,
after that threshold, increasing communications would actually lengthen the
time till adoption.
</p>
<p>Ansari et al. (2008) found that e-mails were strongly associated with
choice of the Internet. This makes sense &ndash; e-mails and the Internet are basi-
cally the same technology, and the availability of a click-through URL in an
e-mail would encourage movement to the Internet. This is supported by Knox
(2005), who found that newly acquired customers evolve toward online, of-
fline, and multichannel segments. The online segment was highly responsive
to e-mails and this appeared to guide them toward the Internet.
</p>
<p>In summary, marketing efforts influence channel choice, and the influence
is heterogeneous across customers. Ansari et al. (2008), and Knox (2005),
have also found that marketing influences purchase incidence. As a result,
marketing influences sales volume as well as the channel that produces that
volume. Avenues for future work include: (1) Is there a &ldquo;channel/marketing
congruency,&rdquo; whereby marketing and channels link well if they use similar
technology (e.g., e-mails and the Internet)? (2) How effective are direct incen-
tives in influencing channel choice? For example, how effective is free shipping
in getting customers to buy online? (3) Much more needs to be learned about
customer heterogeneity. What types of customers respond to marketing by
moving to one channel versus the other?
</p>
<p>25.2.4 Models of Customer Channel Migration
</p>
<p>Researchers have begun to model the customer channel &ldquo;migration&rdquo; process.
Migration can be thought of simply as channel choice, but we use it to con-
vey choices over time. This is particularly important to managers who wish
to route customers to different channels over time, or learn how to create
multichannel customers.
</p>
<p>25.2.4.1 Integrating Channel Choice with Purchase Frequency
and Order Size
</p>
<p>Models developed for consumer scanner data are being adapted to study
customer channel migration. Analogous to the brand choice/purchase inci-
dence/purchase quantity (e.g., Bell et al. 1999), we now have channel choice/</p>

<p>purchase frequency/order size. Since data are available typically for a given
firm, brand choice cannot be modeled. Purchase frequency therefore entails
purchase of the focal firm&rsquo;s products. Order size is the amount spent on the
firm&rsquo;s products, given incidence.
</p>
<p>The advantages of studying purchase frequency/order size/channel choice
holistically are twofold: First, we learn not only the factors that deter-
mine migration, but explicitly link that migration to sales volume. Second,
some researchers (Keane 1997; Sun et al. 2003) suggest that stand-alone
choice models can mis-estimate choice effects: The impact of marketing on
choice construed by a stand-alone choice model might also represent the im-
pact on purchase incidence.
</p>
<p>Ansari et al. (2008) use the framework depicted in Fig. 25.7. Market-
ing communications determine customer behavior, in the form of channel
selection (choice), purchase frequency, and order size. These behaviors are
related contemporaneously and reinforced over time through &ldquo;experience ef-
fects.&rdquo; The authors utilize a type-2 tobit model of purchase frequency and
order size, and integrate it with a binary probit model of choice between
catalog and Internet. The model is as follows:
</p>
<p>bit =
</p>
<p>{
Purchase if b&lowast;it &gt; 0
No Purchase Otherwise
</p>
<p>(25.1a)</p>

(25.1c)
</p>
<p>The un-starred variables (b, q, and w) are observations of whether the cus-
tomer purchases from the firm in period t (bit), if so, how much is spent
(qit), and which channel is chosen (wit). The starred variables (b&lowast;, q&lowast;, and
w&lowast;), are customers&rsquo; latent utilities that drive the observed data. These are
linear functions of customer characteristics, previous behavior or experience,
marketing, and seasonality/trend:
</p>
<p>b&lowast;it = Customer Characteristicsbi + Experiencebit +Marketingbit
+Time Effectsbt + ebit
</p>
<p>q&lowast;it = Customer Characteristicsqi + Experienceqit +Marketingqit
+Time Effectsqt + eqit
</p>
<p>w&lowast;it = Customer Characteristicswi + Experiencewit +Marketingwit
+Time Effectswt + ewit (25.2)
</p>
<p>Customer characteristics include demographics, etc., that remain constant
over time. Experience effects include variables such as expenditures in the
previous period, channel choice in the previous period, etc. The authors also
include cumulative Web usage &ndash; since the Internet was new at the time,
they wanted to investigate permanent learning that might occur. Marketing
includes catalogs and e-mails, modeled as stock variables and interactions
described in Chapter 28. Time effects include seasonality and trend.
</p>
<p>The error terms are assumed to follow a multivariate normal distrib-
ution, correlated across equations. The correlations are considered during
the estimation process, which means that selectivity effects driven by unob-
served variables influencing two or more of the three dependent variables are
controlled for.
</p>
<p>The authors found that catalog choice exhibited strong inertia, i.e., spend-
ing a lot of money on a catalog in the previous month increased the likelihood
the catalog will be chosen if a purchase were made this month. E-mails were
associated with choosing the Internet, although with decreasing returns to
scale. Catalogs did not influence catalog choice at low levels, although did so
at high levels. The authors found several significant effects in their purchase
frequency model, while they find very few significant parameters in the order
size equation. This is quite interesting, suggesting that purchase frequency
is malleable, whereas order size is stable. Perhaps most importantly, the au-
thors found a negative association between cumulative use of the Internet
and purchase incidence, suggesting that Internet purchasing may undermine
customer retention.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>650 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>Knox (2005) developed a similar model to capture purchase frequency,
order size, and choice. He used a nested logit to capture incidence and channel
choice. The main focus of Knox&rsquo;s work, however, is on modeling the process
whereby consumers evolve to form three channel usage segments: Online-
oriented, Off-line oriented, and Multichannel. We discuss this in Sect. 25.2.4.2.
</p>
<p>While we mentioned that estimating stand-alone choice models may be
problematic when variables in the model might also affect purchase incidence,
this needs more study and replication before one can say that stand-alone
choice models are taboo! An example of a very interesting stand-alone logit
model of channel choice is by Thomas and Sullivan (2005a), discussed earlier.
These authors model the choice among the bricks-and-mortar store, the cat-
alog, and Internet. The authors include channel-specific effects of all the
independent variables and find that marketing can affect the choice of Chan-
nel A vs. B differently than it affects the choice of Channel A vs. C. This is
an important notion &ndash; that marketing can affect various channel migrations
differently.
</p>
<p>25.2.4.2 Channel Adoption Models
</p>
<p>An important issue is the process by which customers become loyal to cer-
tain channels, or choose to adopt certain channels. Knox models channel
adoption as a hidden Markov process. The customer is assumed to be in an
(unobserved) segment at any point in time. The possible segments include
the initial or &ldquo;learning&rdquo; segment, as well as the ultimate online, offline, and
multichannel segments. The transition matrix assumed to govern migration
between segments is shown in Table 25.1. Knox assumes that offline, online,
and multichannel are absorbing states &ndash; once customers evolve to one of those
segments, they stay there. This of course is debatable, but useful to study the
initial evolution of segments. The probabilities of migrating from the learning
segment (the P &rsquo;s) depend on marketing (m). This is modeled using a Dirich-
let distribution for each marketing instrument combination (received catalog,
received e-mail, received both, received neither). This captures heterogeneity
in transition likelihood across customers depending on what if any market-
ing communications are received. Knox finds that customers migrate to one
of the three segments, that marketing influences the migration probabilities,
and that the multichannel segment accounts for the highest sales volume.

<p>25.2 The Multichannel Customer 651
</p>
<p>Venkatesan et al. (2007) model the time until the adoption of a second
channel, given the customer is initially using one channel, and then the time
until the adoption of a third channel, given the customer is using two chan-
nels. The authors consider a retailer using a full-priced store, discount-priced
store, and the Internet. The authors define tij , where j equals either 2 or 3, as
the time taken to adopt the second or third channel. The authors formulate
a hazard model of tij as follows:
</p>
<p>h(tij , X&lowast;ij) = h0(tij) &bull; ψ(X&lowast;ij , β) &bull; wi (25.3)
where:
</p>
<p>X&lowast;ij = A set of variables including customer characteristics, customer be-
havior, and marketing variables for customer i, that occur between the
adoption of the j &minus; 1th and jth channel.
</p>
<p>h(tij , X&lowast;ij) = The instantaneous &ldquo;hazard&rdquo; probability that customer i will
adopt his or her jth channel at time tij since the adoption of the j &minus; 1th
channel (j = 2, 3).
</p>
<p>h0(tij) = Baseline hazard rate, i.e., that part of the hazard probability that is
influenced only by the passage of time. The authors use a flexible Weibul
distribution to capture this influence.
</p>
<p>ψ(X&lowast;ij , β) = The impact of the X variables on the hazard probability.
wi = &ldquo;Shared Frailty&rdquo; impact on the hazard probability for customer i. This
</p>
<p>picks up unobserved but stable heterogeneity across customers in their
time to adopting the next channel.
</p>
<p>The authors find that marketing encourages faster channel adoption, al-
though with decreasing returns. The authors find that cross-buying and pur-
chase frequency shortens the time of channel adoption, presumably because
these customers need more channels. Note this supports the self-selection hy-
pothesis (Sect. 25.2.2.2) that high-volume shoppers seek out more channels.
The authors find the number of returns especially increases the length of time
to adopt the third channel. Once customers are using two channels, they have
to be shopping at least at one type of store, so their returns needs are satis-
fied. Another finding involves the baseline hazard &ndash; all else equal, customers
adopt their second channel less quickly than their third. This suggests that
once the customer learns to adopt a second channel, they have acquired the
skill to shift channels (cf. Ward 2001).
</p>
<p>25.2.4.3 Challenges in Modeling Customer Channel Migration
</p>
<p>There are several challenges in modeling channel migration. Selectivity bias
(Chapter 15) can arise regarding the level of marketing received or regard-
ing channel usage. With respect to marketing, Ansari et al. (2008) include
e-mails as an independent variable in their channel choice equation. However,
there may be unobserved variables, e.g., &ldquo;Internet orientation,&rdquo; that generate
the receipt of e-mails, and these same variables generate channel choice. The</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>652 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>result would be a biased estimate of the e-mail &rArr; channel choice coefficient.
We use Ansari et al. as an example, but this problem could occur in any
customer migration model.
</p>
<p>With regard to channel usage, customers may select channels due to un-
observed factors &ndash; e.g., customer involvement with the category &ndash; that drive
both channel usage and total revenues or profits. An observed relationship
between channel usage and profits may be spurious, due not to channel usage
but to these unobserved factors.
</p>
<p>There are two ways to address selectivity. First is to include all variables
that generate marketing contacts or channel usage. For example, companies
use RFM variables to target catalogs; if those variables are included in the
model, this helps to address selectivity in the form of marketing received.
Ansari et al. include several &ldquo;experience&rdquo; variables that implicitly measure
RFM. A second alternative is statistical. One might specify a formal selection
model (Chapter 15; Wooldridge 2002; Maddala 1983) or use instrumental
variables or two-stage least squares to purge the endogenous channel selection
or marketing variables of their endogeneity.
</p>
<p>Ansari et al. (2008), and Knox (2005), control for selectivity in channel
usage by allowing the error terms for purchase, order size, and channel selec-
tion equations to be correlated and incorporate that in estimation. Including
an unobserved heterogeneity intercept does not control for selectivity bias
because the term is still unobserved and could be correlated with the receipt
of marketing, thus the results would still be biased unless this information is
incorporated in the estimation (Chamberlain 1980).
</p>
<p>Gönül et al. (2000) address selectivity bias due to marketing, and Campbell
and Frei (2006) address selectivity in channel choice, using instrumental vari-
ables. They find in both cases that the use of this technique does not change
their results. However, these are just two instances and more work is needed.
</p>
<p>Other methodological challenges in modeling channel migration include
(1) the use of single-equation choice models that do not incorporate purchase
incidence (see Sect. 25.2.3.1) and (2) detail in specifying the marketing vari-
ables (&ldquo;catalogs sent&rdquo; is a very gross measure, given that firms send so many
different kinds of catalogs (Ansari et al. 2008). A final challenge is to model
the research &rArr; purchase &rArr; service process. Verhoef et al. (2007) investigate
this, but their model is cross-sectional. A dynamic model is needed since the
process is temporal.
</p>
<p>25.2.5 Research Shopping
</p>
<p>Research shopping is the propensity of consumers to gather information
(search) on one channel but purchase on another. Kelley (2002) reports
roughly half of online shoppers search on the Internet and then purchase
&ldquo;offline.&rdquo; This is particularly common in consumer electronics, computer
hardware, toys, books, and automobiles. Figure 25.8 reports a DoubleClick</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.2 The Multichannel Customer 653
</p>
<p>Fig. 25.8 Frequency of various types of research shopping (From DoubleClick 2004b).
</p>
<p>(2004b) study documenting the extent of various types of research shopping.
The study shows that Internet &rArr; Store is the most common form (see Ward
and Morganosky 2002, and Farag et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>Research shopping has strategic implications because the customer can
search at competitors&rsquo; channels yet buy from Firm A. The probability a
customer buys from Firm A is:
</p>
<p>Prob(BuyA) = Prob(BuyA|Search A only) &bull; Prob(Search A only)
+Prob(Buy A|Search competitors only) &bull; Prob(Search competitors only)
+Prob(Buy A|Search A and competitors) &bull; Prob(Search A and competitors)
</p>
<p>(25.4)
</p>
<p>The first term represents a loyal customer, i.e., the customer searched for the
product at one of Firm A&rsquo;s channels and purchased from Firm A.1 The last
two terms represent customers who bought from Firm A despite searching
at other firms. Kelley (2002) shows these quantities differ significantly by
retailer. For example, Wal-Mart does a good job of attracting the research
shopper, especially in consumer electronics, computer hardware, computer
software, and small appliances. In books, Barnes and Noble does the best,
whereas Best Buy is best in CD&rsquo;s. Inside 1 to 1 (2003) reports that Coach,
Neiman Marcus, and J. Crew are particularly successful with the first term in
Equation 25.4, i.e., they are particularly successful of directing their Internet
researcher to purchase from their store.
</p>
<p>Verhoef et al. (2007) propose three mechanisms that enable research shop-
ping: attribute advantage, channel lock-in, and cross-channel synergy. At-
</p>
<p>1 For simplicity, we do not specify channel in Equation 25.4. However, as Fig. 24.1 indi-
cates, the full equation would include terms such as BA1, meaning purchase from retailer
A, channel 1, and SA2, meaning search at Retailer A, channel 2.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>654 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>tribute advantage is the perceived advantage of one channel over another in
terms of attributes related to search or purchase. For example, the Internet
may be superior to the store in &ldquo;search convenience,&rdquo; but inferior in &ldquo;service.&rdquo;
This suggests Internet &rArr; Store research shopping. Channel lock-in pertains
to the intrinsic ability of a channel to hold onto its customer. Stores have high
channel lock-in because a sales person courts the customer and the customer
pays a high switching cost to walk out of one store and go to another. The In-
ternet has low lock-in, because there is little to prevent &ldquo;cart abandonment.&rdquo;
Low lock-in encourages research shopping. Cross-channel synergy pertains to
the benefit searching on Channel A has for purchasing at Channel B. The
catalog may be a good search channel because it gets the customer 90%
through the decision of what product to buy. This sets the customer up to
interact effectively with in-store personnel. Cross-channel synergy encourages
research shopping.
</p>
<p>Verhoef et al. measure attribute advantage, channel lock-in, and cross-
channel synergy using a cross-customer model of the research and purchase
channel choice decisions. Table 25.2 summarizes their results. The authors
find that the Internet has an attribute advantage over the store for search,
while the store has an attribute advantage over the Internet for purchase. As
expected, the Internet has low lock in. The authors find a marginally signifi-
cant cross-channel synergy between searching on the Internet and purchasing
in the store. As a result, attribute advantage, lack of lock-in, and cross-
channel synergy are all at work and Internet &rArr; Store was the most common
form of research shopping they observed, collaborating the DoubleClick study.
</p>
<p>The above shows that research shopping is a real phenomenon that can
be managed. Research is needed on exactly how to do this. The phenomenon
needs to be studied at the firm-channel level rather than just the channel level.
In this way the components of Equation 25.4 could be quantified. Finally,
the competitive ramifications of research shopping need to be examined (see
Balasubramanian 1998).

<p>25.2 The Multichannel Customer 655
</p>
<p>25.2.6 Channel Usage and Customer Loyalty
</p>
<p>In Sect. 25.2.2.2 we noted that one possible explanation for multichannel cus-
tomers being higher volume is that multichannel shopping breeds higher loy-
alty. Neslin et al. (2006b) report the evidence on this is mixed but lean-
ing positive. Wright (2002, p. 90), in referring to the banking industry,
states that new technologies had &ldquo;loosened the banker&ndash;customer relation-
ship.&rdquo; However, Shankar et al. (2003) find that Internet usage is associated
with higher loyalty, as do Hitt and Frei (2002) and Campbell and Frei (2006).
Danaher et al. (2003) find that Internet usage enhances the loyalty enjoyed
by high-share brands. Wallace et al. (2004) find that multichannel usage is
associated with enhanced attitudes toward the firm&rsquo;s product. However, as
mentioned earlier, Ansari et al. (2008) find that repeated use of the Internet
is associated with lower purchase frequency.
</p>
<p>Much of the question hinges on the impact of the Internet. The potential
problems with the Internet are: (1) Switching costs are low &ndash; the mildly
dissatisfied customer can easily switch to another website. (2) The Internet
is inherently transaction-oriented with little human contact. Ariely et al.
(2002) find in a lab experiment that customers who used the Internet but
thought they were interacting with a human &ldquo;on the other side&rdquo; developed
higher loyalty to the website than those who thought they were interacting
with a computer-generated recommendation engine.
</p>
<p>Managers can take steps to combat both problems. They can increase
switching costs by storing important information (e.g., credit card number)
so the customer is disadvantaged by switching to another site. Managers
can also humanize their website through the use of &ldquo;shopping advisors&rdquo; &ndash;
sales representatives who engage in an &ldquo;Instant-messenger&rdquo; type conversation
with the online shopper. Perhaps even the use of pictures of people on a
website can humanize it. The humanization of the Internet is an important
area for future research, because the evidence is mixed as to whether the
Internet currently enhances loyalty. Ironically, many of the changes one might
propose to enhance the website increase its cost, and for some companies, the
attractiveness of the Internet is lower cost.
</p>
<p>25.2.7 The Impact of Acquisition Channel
on Customer Behavior
</p>
<p>The key issues in the use of channels for customer acquisition are cost per
acquired customer and quality of acquired customer. Acquisition cost should
obviously vary by channel. That the quality of customer acquired would differ
is less obvious. It is on this topic that we are beginning to learn more.
</p>
<p>Villanueva et al. (2003) use a vector autoregression (VAR) to compare
the return on investment for various channels used for customer acquisition.</p>

</p>
<p>They classify acquisition channels into the matrix shown in Fig. 25.9a. The
two dimensions are level of contact (personal versus mass-market broadcast)
and level of intrusiveness (high versus low). The authors use data from a
website-hosting company that had asked acquired customers to reveal the
channel through which they had been acquired. This yielded a time series of
number of acquisitions per channel. The company also kept track of subse-
quent contribution from each acquired customer, measured as the number of
subsequent logins to the website. This is an appropriate measure because it
relates to advertising revenue that can be generated by the firm.

<p>(ROI). Broadcast advertising (AD) acquires the most valuable customers,
but its cost per acquisition is so high that ROI is the lowest. Conversely,
direct marketing (DM) attracts the least valuable customers, but its
acquisition cost is so low that its ROI is quite high. Villanueva et al. (2008)
expand on these results and find that customers acquired through marketing
efforts tend to add more short-term value compared to word-of-mouth, but
customers acquired through word-of-mouth add more long-term value.
</p>
<p>Verhoef and Donkers (2005) study the impact of acquisition channel on
customer quality in the insurance industry. They model retention and cross-
buying as a function of acquisition channel as well as several control variables
such as customer characteristics. Figure 25.10 displays the logit coefficients
for each channel relative to the average coefficient across channels. Retention
and cross-buying differ appreciably by acquisition channel, after controlling
for customer characteristics. Direct Mail and TV/Radio perform poorly on
both retention and cross-buying. Outbound telephone is good for both reten-
tion and cross-buying. Co-insurance (where customers obtain the insurance
through their employer) is very good for retention, but less so for cross-
buying. The Internet is a little better on average for retention, and a little
below average for cross-selling.

<p>25.2.8 The Impact of Channel Introduction
on Firm Performance
</p>
<p>As the competition to provide multiple channels heats up, a fundamental
question is, what is the impact of adding channels on firm revenues and
performance?</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>658 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>Biyalogorsky and Naik (2003) estimate a time series model using data
from Tower Records, which had introduced an Internet channel. The authors
find that current Web purchases encouraged future Web purchases. They also
find the point estimate for cannibalization of store sales was only $0.89 and
only marginally significant (t = 1.2). However, store sales were autoregressive
&ndash; the lagged store sales coefficient was 0.95 in the store sales equation. To
illustrate, if we take the point estimate for cannibalization as &ldquo;true,&rdquo; the total
impact of the Internet would be $0.89/(1 &minus; 0.95) = $17.80, suggesting that
of the average Web purchase of $32.06, roughly half is taken from current
and future store sales. Again, this is just an exploratory calculation since the
statistical significance of the cannibalization effect is marginal, but illustrates
the importance of short and long-term cannibalization effects.
</p>
<p>Deleersnyder et al. (2002) use time series analysis to analyze the per-
formance of British and Dutch newspapers during the time in which they
introduced a website version. They analyze both the level and trend in per-
formance of two measures &ndash; circulation and advertising revenue. They find
that the introduction of the website had a nominally negative impact on cir-
culation trend for 35 newspapers, but the result was statistically significant in
only five instances. The authors found a nominally positive impact of website
on circulation trend for 32 newspapers, 10 of which were statistically signif-
icant. Results were similar for advertising, as well as for levels as opposed
to trends. Overall, the predominant effect seems to be that the introduction
of a website did not influence newspaper circulation or advertising, although
for a minority of cases the effect can be either positive or negative.
</p>
<p>Pauwels and Dans (2001) examine the impact of the regular print news-
paper on visits to the newspaper website. Newspapers with larger print read-
ership obviously experience greater website visit levels, but also, newspapers
whose demographic profile matches that of the Internet-browsing public also
experience greater website visits. This reinforces the impact that individual
characteristics have on Web usage.
</p>
<p>In a time series analysis of 106 firms during 1992&ndash;2000, Lee and Grewal
(2004) found that early adoption of the Internet as a communications channel
improved stock market performance as measured by Tobin&rsquo;s q, but adoption
as a sales channel had no impact. This could due to the market perceiving
synergies due to communications but potential inter-channel cannibalization
from another sales channel (at least in the early days of the Internet). Con-
sistent with this, Geyskens et al. (2002), in an event analysis of firms in the
newspaper industry, found that the stock market reacted positively to Inter-
net introductions on average, especially for firms that did not currently have
a strong direct market channel presence.
</p>
<p>Coelho et al. (2003) examined 62 UK financial services companies. They
find multichannel companies have higher levels of customer acquisition,
market share, and sales growth, but lower levels of customer retention,
profit, service, and cost control. The retention results are consistent with
Ansari et al. (2008).</p>

<p>Most recently, Pauwels and Neslin (2007) study the impact of introducing
a retail store channel on total company revenues and on revenues from the
company&rsquo;s catalog and website. They find that the store channel increases
total company sales, mostly through increasing customer purchase frequency.
Pauwels and Neslin hypothesized and found that the stores cannibalized the
catalog somewhat, but had virtually no impact on website sales.
</p>
<p>In summary, we have just begun to learn the impact of channel additions
on total firm performance. Most of the work has been on the impact of adding
the Internet channel. Obviously more work is needed to flesh out the complete
cross-impact matrix showing the impact of adding Channel A on Channel B,
C, D, etc.
</p>
<p>25.3 Developing Multichannel Strategies
</p>
<p>25.3.1 Framework for the Multichannel Design Process
</p>
<p>A multichannel customer strategy entails the selection of channels, the assign-
ment of channels to functions and customers, implementation of the strategy,
and evaluation. Figure 25.11 proposes a framework for this process, drawing
heavily on Rangan (1994).
</p>
<p>25.3.2 Analyze Customers
</p>
<p>25.3.2.1 Customer Segmentation
</p>
<p>The goal is to segment customers with an eye toward possibly serving each
segment with different channels. Bases for segmentation include customer
profitability and customer channel preferences. Highly profitable customers</p>

ticated call-centers.
</p>
<p>Companies can use surveys and then predictive models to measure pref-
erences and &ldquo;assign&rdquo; customers to channels. Keen et al. (2004) use the part-
worths from a conjoint analysis, followed by a cluster analysis, to derive four
segments: &ldquo;generalists,&rdquo; who care about all issues, &ldquo;formatters,&rdquo; who have a
particular channel preference, &ldquo;price sensitives,&rdquo; who care about price and
find the channel with the lowest price, and &ldquo;experiencers,&rdquo; who are creatures
of habit, selecting the channel they used last. Konus et al. (2007) use survey
results to derive three segments: &ldquo;enthusiastic multi-channel shoppers, unen-
thusiastic multi-channel shoppers, and store shoppers. Segmentation based
on channel preference is therefore feasible, although Knox (2005) suggests
these preferences evolve over time.
</p>
<p>Note the key issue is not the current level of profits or channel preferences,
but how the customer will respond to using a particular channel &ndash; will it en-
hance customer value? This is where purchase frequency/order size/channel
choice models would be useful for segmentation (Sect. 25.2.4).
</p>
<p>25.3.2.2 Identifying Customer Functionalities to Be Managed
</p>
<p>This stage identifies the functions or customer needs that channels must serve.
Figure 25.12 displays two models for identifying these functions (see also Ur-
ban 2004, pp. 119&ndash;120). Figure 25.12a is based on stage in the customer life-
cycle: acquisition, development, maintenance, and decline. Figure 25.13b is
based on the customer decision process: need recognition, information search,
purchase, and after-sales.
</p>
<p>Customer life-cycle and customer decision functionality could be com-
bined. For example, one could primarily define functions as acquisition, devel-
opment, maintenance, and decline, and then within each of these functions,
subdivide into search, purchase, and after-sales. Customers in the develop-
ment stage might be encouraged to use a certain set of channels for search,
purchase, and after-sales, while customers in the decline stage might be en-
couraged to use a different set of channels.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.3 Developing Multichannel Strategies 661
</p>
<p>25.3.3 Design Channels
</p>
<p>25.3.3.1 Assess Competition
</p>
<p>Competitive effects are particularly salient for multichannel design. The
mantra of &ldquo;We must have a Web presence&rdquo; was spurred by competition.
Neslin et al. (2006b) question whether competitive multichannel strategies
may just be a form of Prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma, as follows:
</p>
<p>Firm B
</p>
<p>Single channel Multiple channel
</p>
<p>Firm A Single channel $100, $100 $60, $120
Multiple channel $120, $60 $80, $80 or $120, $120?
</p>
<p>If both firms pursue the single-channel status quo, they each earn $100. If
Firm A adds a channel while Firm B stands pat, Firm A earns $120 while
Firm B decreases to $60. If Firm B matches Firm A, the result is the lower-
right cell. Here there are two crucial possibilities: (1) competition is exac-
erbated because the firms compete on several fronts. Prices decline but the
market does not grow, and both firms are left with lower profits. (2) Multi-
channel engenders loyalty, or grows the market (e.g., it is quite possible that
opening stores in shopping malls helped grow the market for cell phones). In
this case, both firms benefit.
</p>
<p>How this competition plays out in the real world is a crucial question. Chu
et al. (2007) shed light on it. They study the personal computer market and
develop a logit demand model with a no-purchase option. This enables the
market to grow depending on prices as well as the channels available. The
authors model equilibrium pricing by considering competition among man-
ufacturers as well as downstream pricing of indirect channels, i.e., retailers.
The authors use their model to calculate the profits for various channel con-
figurations. They find through policy simulation that Dell, for example, made
the correct decision to exit the retail channel in 1994. That is, in equilibrium,
they made higher profits by exiting the retail channel.
</p>
<p>Chu et al.&rsquo;s (2007) work is a significant step forward. The work can be
expanded in several ways. First would be to incorporate the channel decision
as a strategic variable-equilibria could change if the channel decision were
made endogenous. Second would be to consider the impact of market seg-
mentation. Third would be to consider channel functionality, either via the
customer life-cycle or the customer decision process. These are exciting areas
for future work.
</p>
<p>Price competition between multichannel (MC) and single channel (PP for
&ldquo;pure play&rdquo;) retailers has received particular attention. Tang and Xing (2001)
find that Internet prices are higher for MC than PP DVD retailers, and that
price dispersion is lower among PP retailers. Pan et al. (2002a) find that
customers perceive MC Internet prices to be higher than PP Internet prices.
They develop a Hotelling model and find that a bricks-and-mortar retailer</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>662 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>should launch an online presence and charge higher prices, if that online
store can be superior to pure play online retailers. This may work if the
multichannel retailer can use the Internet and the bricks-and-mortar store in
combination to provide a superior customer experience.
</p>
<p>As a follow-up, Pan et al. (2002b) study actual prices and find that prices
are lower for PP Internet compared to MC Internet for CD&rsquo;s, DVD&rsquo;s, desktop
computers, and laptop computers, while they are similar for PDA&rsquo;s and elec-
tronics. Interestingly, they found prices are higher for PP Internet for books
and software.
</p>
<p>Ancarani and Shankar (2004) compare MC Internet, PP Internet, and PP
Store prices. They find that PP Store prices are the highest, followed by MC
Internet and PP Internet. However, when shipping and handling is figured
in, the order is MC Internet &gt; PP Internet &gt; PP Store. This differs from
Brynjolfsson and Smith (2000), who find Internet prices net of shipping are
generally lower than in bricks-and-mortar stores. They however did not break
out the results by pure play versus multichannel.
</p>
<p>In summary, it appears that MC Internet prices are greater than PP Inter-
net prices. Perhaps multichannel Internet retailers leverage their bricks-and-
mortar store to create monopoly power. Ancarani and Shankar (2004) find
two instances &ndash; books and software &ndash; where MC Internet &lt; PP Internet. Per-
haps these pure play Internet retailers have built monopoly power through
higher customer loyalty (e.g., Amazon). Indeed, in an important review pa-
per, Pan et al. (2004) find that price dispersion, i.e., differences in prices
across retailers, is often higher on the Internet than off-line. This suggests
that Internet retailers have been able to differentiate themselves.
</p>
<p>25.3.3.2 Select Channels and Assign Functionality
</p>
<p>This stage is a mix-and-match process of assigning channels to segments and
functionalities. Figure 25.13 suggests three strategies. Figure 25.13a is the
&ldquo;Multi-Contact Strategy.&rdquo; This does not emphasize segmentation or func-
tional assignment &ndash; all channels are available to all customers. The question
of which channels the firm should use would be dictated by competitive con-
siderations and cost and revenue impact.
</p>
<p>Figure 25.13b shows a &ldquo;Functional Strategy,&rdquo; where customer segmenta-
tion is still not considered, but channels are assigned to specific functionali-
ties. A wireless phone company might use outbound telemarketing to stimu-
late customer awareness of new features. Customers may then be directed to
the company&rsquo;s website to learn about the specifics and &ldquo;design&rdquo; their optimal
phone. Purchase may be made through the Internet or the company&rsquo;s store.
Post-sales support would be provided by a company representative reachable
through the call center.
</p>
<p>Figure 25.13c shows the &ldquo;Segmentation Strategy.&rdquo; This involves assigning
segments to different channels for different functions. For example, Segment
1 may be low value and hence assigned to the Internet for all functions. An
e-mail may stimulate need recognition and encourage the customer to click</p>

<p>through to the website, design their optimal telephone, purchase it, and re-
ceive after-sales support. Segment 3 might consist of high value customers.
They would be contacted by a company representative who would carefully
explain the new services. The customers would be invited to seek further in-
formation, design their telephone, and purchase it over the Internet, because
the visuals provided online make things easier for the customer. The partic-
ular website for these customers would include an &ldquo;instant-messenger&rdquo; type
facility for interacting with a company representative if desired. After the
purchase, the same representative would contact the customer for after-sales
support.
</p>
<p>Zettelmeyer (2000) analyzes competitive equilibria in channel functional-
ity and prices when customers are heterogeneous in their preferences (i.e.,
there are segments) and online and offline channels can be used for search
and/or purchase. He finds that information provision is one way that firms
can differentiate. For example, if a medium number of customers prefers the
Internet for purchase, firms differentiate themselves in terms of the informa-
tion they provide as well as price. This is very promising work that supports
the segmentation strategy to multichannel design.
</p>
<p>The functionality/segment assignment decision lends itself to an optimiza-
tion. The decision variables would be what channel to assign to what segment
for what function. Required of course would be customer response to these
assignments. Knox (2005), Thomas and Sullivan (2005a), or Ansari et al.
(2008) would be useful in this regard. While optimizing the entire decision
might be too ambitious, one could isolate one stage. Villanueva et al. (2003)
formulate a model to allocate financial resources to different channels for</p>

<p>664 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>customer acquisition, as follows:
</p>
<p>Max

</p>
<p>Π =
&sum;
k
</p>
<p>mknk(xk)&minus;B (25.5a)
</p>
<p>s.t.
&sum;
k
</p>
<p>xk &le; B (25.5b)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Π = Profits.
xk = Dollar expenditures allocated to channel k for customer acquisition.
mk = Profit contribution per customer acquired through channel k.
nk = Number of customers acquired through channel k. This is a function of
</p>
<p>the dollar expenditures allocated to channel k.
B = Acquisition budget.
</p>
<p>Profit contribution (mk) would be available from results such as those shown
in Fig. 25.9. The authors propose a particular function for nk that could be
estimated judgmentally, through testing, or through regression models.
</p>
<p>25.3.3.3 Channel Coordination
</p>
<p>Consider Fig. 25.2, which shows customer preferences for the Internet vs. Tele-
phone. If we use a functional strategy and assign the Internet to be our search
channel, the telephone to be our purchase/after-sales channel, and provide
easy links from the Internet to the telephone (e.g., 800 numbers prominently
displayed on the Internet), we have covered the customer decision process
and coordinated the two channels.
</p>
<p>However, there are many other details to be coordinated among chan-
nels, including marketing mix, research shopping, and organization. There
is even a question of whether channels should be coordinated? Neslin et al.
(2006b) list advantages as: (1) economies of scale, (2) ability to assign chan-
nels to the functions for which they are efficient and make sense competi-
tively (see Zettelmeyer 2000; Achabal et al. 2005; Sect. 25.3.3.2), (3) Better
customer data (Stone et al. 2002), (4) avoidance of channel conflict, (5) im-
proved communications within the firm, (6) stronger customer relationships
through better service (Sousa and Voss 2004; Stone et al. 2002; Bendoly et al.
2005), and (7) barriers to entry &ndash; an entrant must enter on multiple channels
and coordinate them. The disadvantages include: (1) loss of flexibility &ndash; one
cannot opportunistically use a particular channel to solve a problem with-
out re-coordinating all the channels, (2) large investment (see Sect. 25.3.3.1;
Sousa and Voss 2004), (3) decreased motivation for non-owned intermedi-
aries who do not see a benefit from channel coordination, and (4) increased
skill-requirements for channel mangers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.3 Developing Multichannel Strategies 665
</p>
<p>Assume the firm decides to coordinate its channels. Consider coordination
of product assortment. The problem is that carrying the same products in
each channel creates channel conflict if some of the channels are non-owned
intermediaries. For example, financial services agents (who sell products from
several companies) may become less devoted to the firm if the same products
are available over the Internet.
</p>
<p>One solution, supported by Bergen et al. (1996) is to use &ldquo;branded vari-
ants,&rdquo; where the firm distributes minor variations of its products across chan-
nels. This increases customer search costs because customers have to compare
more details to decide which product to buy. This creates more monopoly
power for each channel. For example, a consumer electronics firm may dis-
tribute Model 446G through Best Buy, but Model 446Gb through Wal-Mart.
The differences may be minor, but the customer finds it difficult to compare
them. Hence, the customer shops only at one channel and focuses on what
that channel can offer. Branded variants are a potential way to avoid conflicts
between channels. However, there still may be conflicts if various channels vie
for the best variants! For example, Wal-Mart may demand that Model 446Gb
be the model with extra features, whereas Best Buy would want the model
with the extra features.
</p>
<p>When channels are owned by the firm, product coordination becomes an
issue of targeting. For example, Best-Buy may know that its Internet cus-
tomers are less quality sensitive and more price sensitive, so may carry a
lower tier product line on its website.
</p>
<p>Another area of coordination is price. As Neslin et al. (2006b) note, a com-
pelling reason to offer different prices across channels is price discrimination.
Lynch and Ariely (2000) and Shankar et al. (2001) suggest that price sensi-
tivity is lower for online customers. Assuming this to be true, prices online
should be higher than prices offline. However, the online shopper can learn
that the same product can be bought less expensively at the retail store. This
has several negative implications. First, the profits from price discrimination
are lost. Second, the customer feels cheated and loses trust in the company.
Third, more traffic is driven to the store, which is the higher cost channel.
Fourth, one solution is branded variants, but this adds costs and confuses
customers who expect the Internet and the retail store of the same company
to be in sync.
</p>
<p>Two ways to charge different prices are price promotions and channel sur-
charges. The regular price of the same product may be the same at the
Internet and the store, but the store can temporarily discount the prod-
uct. Surcharges are another way to increase prices, particularly on the In-
ternet. For example, the price of the product may be identical on the
Web and in the store, but the shipping charges may be significantly higher
than needed to cover the marginal shipping cost to the firm. This effec-
tively increases price on the Web (and sets up a strong promotion &ndash; free
shipping!).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>666 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>A third area of channel coordination is communications. The argument
for coordination is that it reinforces positioning and creates a stronger cus-
tomer relationship. However, if the firm is using a segmentation strategy (Fig.
25.13c), communications perhaps should differ by channel. For example, the
website design might highlight low prices if the target group is price sensi-
tive, while retail store communications should emphasize product quality and
service if it is targeting the quality-sensitive customer.
</p>
<p>Another aspect of communications is how much to spend on commu-
nicating through each channel. Berger et al. (2006) develop an analytical
model that differentiates three cases: (1) &ldquo;separation,&rdquo; where the chan-
nels are managed as separate entities, (2) &ldquo;partial integration,&rdquo; where one
channel may be considered a separate entity but the firm may be will-
ing to pay some of its costs, and (3) &ldquo;full integration,&rdquo; in which the
firm manages all its channels collectively to maximize total profits. The
authors find that the optimal communications expenditures yield highest
profit under the full integration strategy. This is a good argument for
holistic management of the firm&rsquo;s channels, at least the channels the firm
owns.
</p>
<p>An important coordination issue is managing the research shopper so as
to prevent the customer from searching on Firm A&rsquo;s website but purchasing
at Firm B&rsquo;s store. One way to prevent research shopping is to improve pur-
chase attributes of the Internet or increase Internet channel lock-in (Verhoef
et al. 2007). However, the customer may still want to research shop. The key
then is to make sure the shopping is at Firm A&rsquo;s store and not Firm B&rsquo;s.
Actions Firm A can take include: (1) provide store locators on the Inter-
net, (2) offer a coupon on the Web for purchases at the store, (3) offer free
product pickup if the product is ordered on the Web but picked up at the
store.
</p>
<p>A final channel coordination issue is organizational. One example is
when a predictive model is used to identify the best customer prospects,
say for an insurance company. The most cost-efficient approach might be to
send a direct-mail piece to these customers. However, this bypasses the finan-
cial agents, who are always looking for prospects. The solution is to divide
the top prospects in half and solicit half of them through direct mail, and
provide the other half to the financial agents for their own prospecting efforts.
This may be less profitable in the short term, but more profitable in the long
term because the financial agents&rsquo; loyalty to the firm is increased.
</p>
<p>Another important organizational issue is whether channels should be
managed as independent profit centers or one entity. When the Internet chan-
nel emerged, many firms set up separate Internet operations and let Internet
channel managers &ldquo;run their own show.&rdquo; However, this does not necessarily
maximize total firm profits (cf. Berger et al. 2006). Firms must achieve a
balance so that channel managers have the flexibility to pursue opportunities
that other channels aren&rsquo;t ready to pursue, while coordinating efforts so for
example channel managers don&rsquo;t fight over the same customers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.3 Developing Multichannel Strategies 667
</p>
<p>25.3.4 Implementation
</p>
<p>There are several tasks in implementing a multichannel strategy. One of
course is the physical design of the channels &ndash; i.e., the website design, the store
layout, etc. These details are beyond our scope. However, there are two issues
&ndash; &ldquo;right channeling&rdquo; and employee management &ndash; that warrant our attention.
</p>
<p>25.3.4.1 Right-Channeling
</p>
<p>Right-channeling means making sure that the right customers utilize the right
channels. This is a crucial part of implementing a Segmentation strategy
(Fig. 25.13 c). Right-channeling might occur naturally if customer segments
self-select into the channels they prefer. However, this may not be the most
profitable arrangement for the company. Companies can therefore use a va-
riety of incentives (targeted promotions, etc.), dedicated websites or firm
agents, etc., to ensure the right customer uses the right channel.
</p>
<p>A particular challenge in right-channeling customers is managing call cen-
ters. Companies can provide different levels of service within a call center,
making the call center a collection of separate channels. The question is which
customers should be routed to which center? This has an impact on imme-
diate as well as future profits.
</p>
<p>Sun and Li (2005) develop a dynamic optimization model for deciding
whether customer inquiries should be directed to an &ldquo;on-shore&rdquo; or &ldquo;off-shore&rdquo;
call center. The off-shore call center is less expensive; the on-shore call center
generates higher satisfaction levels. In addition, there are different types of
calls &ndash; transactional questions involve billing, product news, and product
services; technical questions involve service, software or installation problems.
</p>
<p>Sun and Li (2005) model call duration and customer retention. Duration
is a function of previous duration, the type of call, and the call center. Re-
tention depends on previous call duration and variables such as promotions
that might have been offered to retain the customer. These models are in-
serted into an optimization that decides which call center customer i should
be routed to at time t for call type k in order to maximize long-term profits.
The optimization captures trade-offs such as: the customer prefers on-shore
call centers, but the customer tends to take a long time when making an
inquiry. This suggests the customer be allocated to the off-shore call center.
However, if the consumer is averse to off-shore call centers, the customer
might churn and the company will lose its monthly subscription fee. In addi-
tion, customer-level parameters are not known in advance, so must be learned
over time. This is done by estimating the descriptive models using a latent
class approach, and re-classifying each customer in one segment or another
after each transaction.
</p>
<p>The authors find two segments: Customers in Segment 1 are time-
sensitive and dislike off-shore call centers. Customers in Segment 2 are less</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>668 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>time-sensitive and less averse to off-shore call center. The optimization there-
fore tends to allocate Segment 2 customers to the off-shore call center. Policy
simulations show that the proposed optimization improves both retention
and profits, and the degree of improvement increases over time as the model
learns which segment the customer is in.
</p>
<p>Sun and Li&rsquo;s research is important because it shows that right-channeling
can be achieved through predictive modeling coupled with forward looking
optimization. It implements the Segmentation Strategy in Fig. 25.13c with
respect to after-sales support. While in this situation, the customer was as-
signed to a channel, the model could be expanded to include which channel
the customer should be encouraged to use, and if so, whether an incentive is
needed to get the customer to use the &ldquo;right channel.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>25.3.4.2 Employee Training and Incentives
</p>
<p>Employees are key participants in the multichannel strategy. A retailer may
want high value customers to use the store and receive special service. Sales
personnel need to be trained to recognize a high value customer, and how
to service him or her. A catalog company may recognize that its catalog
customers who order by phone seek service and conversation, as opposed to
its Internet customers, who are more efficiency minded. Accordingly, phone
personnel must be trained as sales representatives, not order takers.
</p>
<p>Employee incentives can encourage the right employee behavior. For ex-
ample, rewarding store personnel based on whether the customer cites them
at checkout is one technique. The call center representative for the on-shore
call center can be rewarded for the brevity of service times, assuming the
query is satisfactorily resolved.
</p>
<p>25.3.5 Evaluation
</p>
<p>25.3.5.1 Single View of the Customer?
</p>
<p>Using more channels makes it difficult for the firm to assemble a complete
database of the customer&rsquo;s interactions with the company. There are three di-
mensions to the data picture: (1) channels, (2) stages of the decision process,
and (3) competitive information. A true single view of the customer would
mean the firm knows about the interaction of its customers with all its chan-
nels at all stages of the customer decision process, with the firm and with its
competitors. Interactions with competitors are extremely difficult to obtain,
although recent work by Du et al. (2005) and Kamakura et al. (2003) propose
statistical procedures for inferring customer competitive activity.
</p>
<p>Given the difficulty in obtaining competitive data, we focus only on deci-
sion process and channel. For a three-channel firm, the possible combinations</p>

<p>of data to be assembled are shown in Table 25.3. The table shows our judg-
ments of how easy it is for firms to assemble each combination. The bottom-
right cell signifies a single view of the customer across all channels and all de-
cision stages. It is very difficult to assemble these data. Catalog information is
easy to assemble for purchase and after-sales. This is why single-channel cat-
alog companies were the first to apply database marketing. Purchase data are
also easy to collect from the Web, because the customer must provide a name
and billing address. It is therefore easy to merge these data with the catalog
information and create a catalog/Web integrated database of purchase behav-
ior. However, it is not as easy to collect after-sales usage on the Web, because
customers may just use the Web for information and not identify themselves.
Search behavior is very difficult to obtain for the catalog and store, although
a little easier for the Web, since customers may register or have a cookie on
their computers if they have previously done business with the firm.
</p>
<p>Table 25.3 shows the myriad of information required for a single view of the
customer. It is for this reason that a firm might be content to consider single
view of the customer as obtaining purchase information across all channels.
Even this is challenging because store purchase data is moderately difficult
to obtain unless the customer is a member of the firm&rsquo;s loyalty program and
diligently uses his or her loyalty card.
</p>
<p>Illustrating the challenges in implementing a single view of the customer
(Yates 2001) found that roughly half of 50 retailers they surveyed had learned
&ldquo;nothing&rdquo; about cross-channel shoppers. Zornes (2004) reports more recently
on these challenges and potential solutions. For example, he finds that many
firms use &ldquo;homegrown&rdquo; customer data integration (CDI) solutions; more than
68% of IT and business professionals he surveyed were planning to evaluate
commercial CDI software.
</p>
<p>The question then becomes, how much should the firm invest in acquiring
a single view of its customers? Neslin et al. (2006b) present a formal model
in which the benefits of the percentage of customers for which it has a single
view are a concave function of this percentage, and the costs are convex. The
benefits of single view are concave because once the company has a single view
for a critical mass of customers, it can use predictive modeling to score the
rest of its customers for cross-selling programs, churn management, etc. The</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>670 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>costs are convex because the costs of tracking down the customer for every
single store purchase become astronomical once the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; customers, i.e.,
those who use a loyalty card, are monitored. The result is that a middle range
percentage of customers with single view is optimal. Ridgby and Leidingham
(2005) reinforce this conclusion in their discussion of the banking industry.
</p>
<p>One important study that suggests CDI may pay off is by Zahay and
Griffin (2004). These authors survey 209 B2B executives and measure &ldquo;CIS
Development&rdquo; &ndash; the quality and specificity of information available to the
company, as well as how easily that data are shared among executives. The
authors do not measure data integration per se, but companies that self-
report high CIS development probably are more likely to have a single view
of its customers. Importantly, the research finds a positive relationship be-
tween CIS Development and better performance measures related to customer
retention, lifetime value, etc., and in turn, these measures relate positively to
business growth. This is the most promising indication we have so far that
the quality of the data collected leads to improved performance. Obviously,
more work is needed that specifically hones in on the performance impact of
data integration across channels.
</p>
<p>25.3.5.2 Predictive Modeling Implications
</p>
<p>The challenge of predictive modeling in a multichannel environment is ar-
ticulated nicely by Hansotia and Rukstales (2002). Consider the case of a
direct mail offer that asks customers to respond via an 800 telephone num-
ber. Response is measured through this single channel. However, the predic-
tive model based on these data may be misleading. First, &ldquo;non-responders&rdquo;
may have bought on another channel. Second, responders possibly would
have bought on another channel even if they had not received the offer.
The solution is to: (1) assemble data on customer purchases across all chan-
nels. (2) include customers who received as well as did not receive the offer.
Only then can the predictive model be used to forecast incremental sales per
customer.
</p>
<p>Consider the case (Hansotia and Rukstales 2002) that a company delivers
an offer to a subset of its customers (the &ldquo;treatment group&rdquo;) but not to a
&ldquo;control group.&rdquo; Assume the company has a single view of its customers.
Following is a hypothetical decision tree analysis based on the predictor vari-
able X, split on the value &ldquo;A.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Split 1 Split 2
</p>
<p>Predictor variable X &le; A &ge; A
Treatment group purchase rate 4% 3%
Unadjusted difference in purchase rate due to X 1.0%
Control group purchase rate 1.5% 1%
Incremental purchase rate for each split 2.5% 2%
Adjusted &ldquo;Incremental&rdquo; difference in purchase rate due to X 0.5%</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.3 Developing Multichannel Strategies 671
</p>
<p>For X &le; A, 4% of the treatment group purchased from the company in a
given time period, across all channels. This compares to 3% for X &ge; A.
The apparent, &ldquo;unadjusted&rdquo; increase in purchase rate due to X is 1%. How-
ever, a portion of the treatment group customers might have bought with-
out the offer. Consider the control group that did not receive the offer.
For X &le; A, 1.5% of these customers purchased across all channels. That
means that only 2.5% (4 &minus; 1.5) of the customers with X &le; A incremen-
tally purchased as a result of the offer. For X &ge; A, the incremental re-
sponse was 2.0% (3 &minus; 1). In conclusion, the true incremental difference in
purchase rate between X &le; A and X &ge; A is the adjusted 0.5%, not the
unadjusted 1%.
</p>
<p>Hansotia and Rukstales (2002) discuss a tree-modeling procedure for ana-
lyzing incremental response. This can also be accomplished with a regression
model:
</p>
<p>Response = β0 + β1X+ β2D (25.6a)
</p>
<p>β1 = δ0 + δ1D (25.6b)
</p>
<p>&rArr; Response = β0 + (δ0 + δ1D)X + β2D
= β0 + δ0X+ δ1DX+ β2D (25.6c)
</p>
<p>where Response is customer purchases across all channels, X indicates
whether the customer received the offer, and D is a set of predictors. The
term δ0 + δ1D measures the extent to which response to the offer is incre-
mental. The term β0 + β2D represents baseline sales among customers with
demographic profile D. If β0 = β2 = 0, baseline sales equal zero, i.e., cus-
tomers would not have bought had they not received the offer, and we could
run a traditional predictive model only among customers who received the
offer. However if β0 or β2 �= 0, Response (among those who receive the offer)
= β0+δ0+δ1D+β2D = (β0+δ0)+(δ1+β2)D. This estimated equation would
be used to score customers, but the resultant rank ordering will be inaccurate
because it will confuse incremental response (δ0 and δ1) and baseline response
(β0 and β2).
</p>
<p>In summary, in a multichannel environment, traditional predictive models
may not predict incremental response. One needs multichannel data and
data that include customers who received and did not receive the offer. This
issue can occur in subtle ways even in a single channel company. A catalog
company sends out several catalogs, which are essentially different channels.
The typical predictive model includes only those who received Catalog A and
considers response only to Catalog A. This may not represent incremental
sales generated by Catalog A, since customers might have bought from other
catalogs even if they had not received Catalog A.</p>

<p>672 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>25.4 Industry Examples
</p>
<p>25.4.1 Retail &ldquo;Best Practice&rdquo; (Crawford 2002)
</p>
<p>Crawford (2002) cites Sears and REI as exemplars of successful multichannel
retailers. Sears emphasizes a single &ldquo;face&rdquo; to the Sears brand in all channels &ndash;
Web, catalog, or retail store. Sears coordinates its website and store by allow-
ing customers to order on the Web and pick up the product at the store. This
is achieved because Sears has an integrated database between the website and
store, so when the customer places an order on the Web, the store sees that
order. This linkage pays off because 21% of customers who pick up at the store
buy additional product in the store. In addition, Sears has reinforced the cen-
trality of their bricks-and-mortar stores by crediting stores with any purchase
picked up at the store, even if &ldquo;purchased&rdquo; via the catalog or the Web.2
</p>
<p>REI specializes in outdoor sporting products, positioned around the exper-
tise and enthusiasm of it store representatives. Similar to Sears, this makes
the store the central focus of multichannel management, and the goal is to
move customers from the catalog or website to the store. REI does this by
emphasizing the stores at the website. REI has an easy-to-use store locator
and a &ldquo;stores and events&rdquo; tab that promotes special store activities. REI
thought at first that the website would replace the catalog, but they found
that catalog customers resisted changing their shopping habits to frequent
the Web. The entire coordination of catalog, Web, and store is facilitated by
data integration &ndash; REI has a single view of 80% of its individual customers
across channels. It uses this information to target marketing efforts such as
e-mails.
</p>
<p>25.4.2 Waters Corporation (CRM ROI Review 2003)
</p>
<p>CRM ROI Review (2003) reports the experiences of the Waters Corpora-
tion, a large chemical company in the liquid chromatography business. The
privately held company traditionally emphasized customer relationships, a
simple task when the direct sales force was the only channel, and reps
could develop relationships and collect all the data needed to monitor that
relationship. However, as the company began to rely on additional chan-
nels, Waters made a significant investment in information technology to
achieve the information integration they desired. They purchased the mySAP
system (see Urban 2004), which integrated their customer data. In addition,
</p>
<p>2 Note there are compensation issues and measurement issues that can ensue because
the catalog or Internet may be instrumental in generating the sale, yet they are not
&ldquo;credited&rdquo; with the sale. Over time, the importance of these channels is less salient and
the firm may under-invest in them.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>25.4 Industry Examples 673
</p>
<p>they took the next step to use the data to target marketing efforts more
efficiently.
</p>
<p>For example, the chemistry group used to implement 15 direct mail cam-
paigns per year targeting 40,000 names, and the HPLC and mass spectrom-
etry groups each implemented 5&ndash;6 campaigns targeting 28,000 customers.
The first mundane but crucial task was to understand the level of duplica-
tion among these separate efforts. Now, the chemistry group mails to 32,000
customers while the HPLC and mass spectrometry groups mail to 25,000
customers, and response rates have risen by 50%. With the savings in mar-
keting budget, the chemistry group implements three additional campaigns
per year, yielding an additional $120,000 in revenue.
</p>
<p>Data integration is especially important at the acquisition stage. Lead
follow-up is more efficient now. No matter how the lead enters the system,
the sales rep has access to the data and can follow-up. Service efficiency has
improved dramatically because service personnel have complete data on the
customer at each service call.
</p>
<p>CRM ROI Review (2003) calculates an internal rate of return of 35% on
the $5.1 million investment, including benefits of $250,000 from lead follow-
up, $3 million in revenue from online sales (net of channel switching), and
$750,000 in additional telesales and increased response rates due to better-
targeted direct marketing campaigns.
</p>
<p>25.4.3 The Pharmaceutical Industry (Boehm 2002)
</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally relied on physicians, retail
pharmacies, and managed care organizations to sell its product. It now wishes
to add channels such as the Web, mail-order, and call centers. One poten-
tial barrier is patients&rsquo; privacy concerns. While privacy certainly is an is-
sue among many patients, a surprising number of patients support targeted
marketing efforts. Boehm (2002) finds that in certain treatment categories
(mental health, asthma, gastrointestinal problems), more than 70% of pa-
tients would value personalized disease information, more than 50% would
share personal information with a drug company to learn more about treat-
ment approaches, and more than 50% do not mind drug marketing as long
as it is personalized.
</p>
<p>Boehm (2002) emphasizes that the pharmaceutical industry must coor-
dinate its channel efforts across the phases of the patient decision process,
including awareness, consideration, physician contact, filling the prescription,
and persistence and compliance (loyalty). For example, advertising may be
best for generating awareness, while the Web and call centers may work
well for facilitating consideration. These channels need to funnel patients to
their physicians, where traditional detailing can ensure that the physician is
equipped to answer patient questions and prescribe the drug if it suits the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>674 25 Multichannel Customer Management
</p>
<p>patient. Then the Web or e-mail can be used to ensure patient compliance
and persistence, i.e., that the patient takes medications as prescribed, and
fills prescriptions when they run out. This is an example of a Functional
channel strategy (Fig. 25.13b).
</p>
<p>25.4.4 Circuit City (Smith 2006; Wolf 2006)
</p>
<p>Circuit City faces a highly competitive business in retail consumer electronics.
However, they recently have improved results dramatically through upgrades
in their retail stores and Internet channel, and coordination between the
two. In the words of Phil Schoonover, chairman of Circuit City Stores, &ldquo;Our
multichannel marketing efforts drove improved traffic trends in all channels,
and we saw an increase in Web-originated sales picked up in our stores.&rdquo;
Indeed, not only were online sales up 85% during the first quarter of 2006
versus a year ago, but more than half of all items ordered online were picked
up at the store. This of course enabled the customer to obtain the product
immediately, and allowed Circuit City staff to cross-sell as appropriate. In
fact, a major part of the multichannel strategy was increasing training for
store personnel.
</p>
<p>25.4.5 Summary
</p>
<p>The above industry examples illustrate the importance of channel coordina-
tion. Sears, REI and Waters integrate data across channels. This seems to
pay off in two ways. First is through better targeted marketing campaigns
(Waters). Second is through the ability to offer better services (Sears and
REI) such as store pick-up of items ordered on the Web.
</p>
<p>In addition, we see in the Circuit City case that right-channeling al-
lows the firm to retain research shoppers. Right-channeling was achieved
by encouraging store pick-up of Web orders. This case involves a Functional
channel strategy with segmentation occurring on a self-selection basis (e.g.,
half of Circuit City&rsquo;s Web orders were not picked up at the store). The phar-
maceutical industry would like to move in this direction, and there appear
to be promising opportunities despite concerns about privacy and the highly
traditional ways of doing business in that industry.</p>

<p>Chapter 26
</p>
<p>Acquisition and Retention
Management
</p>
<p>Abstract While customer acquisition and retention programs are important
in their own right, the firm needs to manage acquisition and retention in a
coordinated fashion. This chapter addresses how companies should allocate
their efforts to acquisition and retention. We discuss the models that are
relevant to this task, and then optimize several of them to demonstrate their
value and gain insights on when the company should allocate more resources
to either acquisition or retention. We show for example that the adage, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
cheaper to retain than acquire a customer, so we should spend more on
acquisition,&rdquo; needs to be sharpened considerably before it can be used to
guide acquisition and retention spending. We conclude by introducing the
&ldquo;Customer Management Marketing Budget,&rdquo; a tool for planning acquisition
and retention expenditures over time.
</p>
<p>26.1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Customer acquisition and retention are the means by which a company man-
ages the size and profitability of its customer base. This chapter is about
coordinating these two efforts. We examine the following questions:
</p>
<p>&bull; How can we model the roles of acquisition and retention expenditures in
developing the size and profitability of the customer base?
</p>
<p>&bull; How can the firm decide how much to spend on acquisition or retention?
&bull; Under what conditions is it better to emphasize acquisition versus reten-
</p>
<p>tion?
&bull; How can firms organize acquisition and retention spending in a planning
</p>
<p>budget?
&bull; How can firms develop an overall strategy for acquisition and retention?
</p>
<p>It seems that acquisition and retention go in and out of &ldquo;vogue&rdquo; in terms of
popularity. During the 90&rsquo;s, with the advent of new consumer services such
as the Internet and cellular telephones, as well as deregulation of industries
</p>

<p>676 26 Acquisition and Retention Management
</p>
<p>such as financial services, the emphasis was on acquisition. Later, as these
industries matured and mantras such as &ldquo;it costs less to retain than to acquire
a customer&rdquo; prevailed, retention became crucial. AOL presents a good exam-
ple. During the 1990s, the firm focused almost solely on customer acquisition,
blanketing the USA with computer CD disks that promoted customer trial.
Then, as AOL saw its total customer base drop from 23.4 million in June
2004 to 20.8 million in June 2005 (Cohen et al. 2005), and faced a maturing
market, it focused on customer retention (Bold 2003). As another example,
Citibank decided to &ldquo;cut top acquisition job in retention refocus&rdquo; (Marketing
2003). On the other hand, in a survey of business-to-business managers 28.4%
reported that customer acquisition would be their primary goal for 2005; only
7.7% named customer retention (Maddox and Krol 2004).
</p>
<p>In short, companies are facing real, difficult decisions regarding acqui-
sition and retention, and this is the focus of this chapter. Our emphasis
is on allocation &ndash; how much money should be invested in acquisition and
retention &ndash; rather than the tactics of how to efficiently acquire customers
or retain them. These specifics are covered in earlier chapters on customer
acquisition, churn, and multichannel management.
</p>
<p>26.2 Modeling Acquisition and Retention
</p>
<p>26.2.1 The Blattberg and Deighton (1996) Model
</p>
<p>Blattberg and Deighton (1996) presented the seminal treatment of acquisi-
tion and retention by (1) articulating the objective function as &ldquo;customer
equity,&rdquo; and (2) showing how customer equity could be modeled. By cus-
tomer equity, Blattberg and Deighton mean the profit generated through the
firm&rsquo;s acquisition and retention efforts. While lifetime value of the customer
(LTV) is the profit of the customer once acquired, customer equity combines
acquisition and subsequent LTV. Blattberg and Deighton consider the case
of a firm investing $A in acquiring customers at some point in time, and the
long-term pay-out of that investment. Their fundamental equation can be
stated as1:
</p>
<p>Π = a (M &minus;R)
(
</p>
<p>1 + d
1 + d&minus; r
</p>
<p>)
&minus;A (26.1)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Π = Profit per prospect.
a = The fraction of prospects that is acquired.
</p>
<p>1 This equation differs from Blattberg and Deighton (1996, p. 142) due to the assumed
timing of when retention expenditures are made and have their effect. We assume that
firms acquire customers in a given year and spend $R per customer during that year to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.2 Modeling Acquisition and Retention 677
</p>
<p>M = The profit contribution per year per acquired customer (assumed con-
stant over time).
</p>
<p>r = The fraction of acquired customers that is retained each year.
R = Expenditures per year per customer on customer retention.
A = Expenditures per prospect on customer acquisition.
d = Annual discount rate.
</p>
<p>The above formulation assumes a simple retention LTV model with constant
retention rate (Chapter 5), and customers contribute M&minus;R per year. It there-
fore can be written as:
</p>
<p>Π = aLTV &minus;A (26.2)
Equation 26.1 and the simplified Equation 26.2 captured for the first time the
coordination of acquisition and retention. Profits will be high to the extent
that the firm is able to convert a high percentage of its prospects (a) into
high-value customers (LTV ) at low cost (A).
</p>
<p>Acquisition and retention expenditures (A&amp;R) are the firm&rsquo;s decision vari-
ables, and acquisition rate, retention rate, and customer contribution (a, r,
and M) are the key outcome variables. Blattberg and Deighton modeled
acquisition rate as follows:
</p>
<p>a = ca(1&minus; e&minus;kaA) (26.3)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>ca = The acquisition ceiling, i.e., the percentage of prospects that could be
acquired with an infinitely high acquisition budget.
</p>
<p>ka = Acquisition efficiency, i.e., how fast the acquisition rate approaches the
ceiling as the firm increases its acquisition expenditures.
</p>
<p>Figure 26.1 shows acquisition response curves for various parameter val-
ues. The model assumes customers do not naturally start buying from
the company, e.g., through word-of-mouth. Therefore, we see that with
$0 spent on acquisition, no customers are acquired. It would be easy to
add a constant term to Equation 26.3 to represent this baseline acquisi-
tion rate. However, the zero-zero assumption seems realistic for most situ-
ations. The other important assumption is decreasing returns to scale &ndash; the
gains from additional expenditures get smaller and smaller as more money is
spent.
</p>
<p>retain them. The total contribution from an acquired customer is therefore (M &minus;R) +
(M&minus;R)&times;(r/(1+d))+(M&minus;R)&times;(r/(1+d))2+. . . = (M&minus;R)&times;(1+d)/(1+d&minus;r)). Blattberg
and Deighton assume the money to retain customers acquired in Period 1 is spent in
</p>
<p>Period 2, so have R/r in their equation to &ldquo;discount&rdquo; retention expenditures back one
period. That is, if there are 1,000 customers in Period 1 and a 70% retention rate, there
are 700 in period 2. The firm spends R &times; (700/r) on retention in period 2, so R/r per
customer retained in period 2. We find our formulation a bit more straightforward, e.g.,
a company acquires 1,000 customers during Year 1 and spends $R per customer during
that year (on service, renewal forms, etc.), to retain the customer for Year 2.</p>

<p>Pfeifer (2005) provides some important insights on the model&rsquo;s implica-
tion for average acquisition costs and marginal acquisition costs. Average
acquisition cost answers the following question: Given the firm has spent
$A on acquisition and acquires a% of its prospects, what is its average cost
per acquired customer? The answer is simply A/a. Average acquisition cost</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.2 Modeling Acquisition and Retention 679
</p>
<p>is easy to calculate &ndash; without any model &ndash; simply by dividing total acquisi-
tion expenditures by the number of acquired customers. On the other hand,
marginal acquisition cost answers the following question: Given the firms is
spending $A and acquires a% of its prospects, what would be the cost of
acquiring an additional prospect?
</p>
<p>Average and marginal acquisition costs are profoundly different in the in-
formation they convey. Average acquisition cost summarizes what it currently
costs to acquire customers. Marginal acquisition cost tells what it would cost
to add more customers. We draw on Pfeifer (2005) to derive expressions for
average and marginal acquisition cost. Pfeifer solves the acquisition response
curve for expenditure A as a function of acquisition rate a:
</p>
<p>Number of Customers Acquired = A = &minus; 1
ka
</p>
<p>ln
(
(ca &minus; a)
</p>
<p>ca
</p>
<p>)
(26.4)
</p>
<p>from which it follows:
</p>
<p>Average Acquisition Cost =
A
</p>
<p>a
= &minus; 1
</p>
<p>aka
ln
(
(ca &minus; a)
</p>
<p>ca

<p>)

</p>
<p>Marginal Acquisition Cost =
&part;A
</p>
<p>&part;a
=
</p>
<p>1
ka(ca &minus; a) (26.6)
</p>
<p>The equations imply three things. First, both costs sensibly decrease if acqui-
sition is more efficient (higher ka). Second, both costs decrease if the ceiling
is higher (higher ca). For average costs, this follows because a higher ceiling
means more customers are acquired for a given expenditure. For marginal
costs, Fig. 26.1b shows that with a higher ceiling, the slope of the curve is
less positive for a given acquisition expenditure.
</p>
<p>Third, higher acquisition expenditures imply higher average as well as
higher marginal costs. This is a consequence of decreasing returns. Figure 26.2
captures the relationship. On the x-axis is the amount spent per prospect.
On the y-axis are average acquisition cost, marginal acquisition cost, and
the acquisition rate. Note that marginal costs increase quite rapidly at high
expenditure levels. This is because at high expenditure levels, the acquisition
rate curve is almost at its ceiling. Additional expenditures bring only minor
increases in acquisition rate, so the cost of bringing in another &ldquo;marginal&rdquo;
customer becomes very expensive.

<p>The Blattberg and Deighton model includes a retention response function
analogous to the acquisition function. Accordingly, we have, as derived by
Pfeifer:

</p>
<p>model assumes that if nothing is spent on retention, the retention rate would
be zero. This might not hold in practice. For example, a cable provider might
spend virtually zero on customer retention yet have very high retention rates
because of the absence of strong competition.
</p>
<p>Blattberg et al. (2001) extend the basic Blattberg/Deighton model in three
important ways. First, they stipulate different segments with different acqui-
sition rates, retention rates, and contributions. Second, they do not rely on
the simple retention model, which is assumed in Equation 26.1. Third they
distinguish between retention expenses and &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; selling, which includes
up-selling and cross-selling. The resulting equation for the long-term prof-
itability of acquisition efforts made in period t is:
</p>
<p>Πt =

Cit = Costs of goods sold per customer in segment i in period t.
Ait = Acquisition costs per prospect in segment i in period t.
ri,t+j = Retention rate, i.e., the percentage of segment i customers who are

</p>
<p>Blattberg et al. (2001) discuss different ways to make the acquisition, re-
tention, and add-on selling efforts more productive (i.e., higher ceiling and
efficiency coefficients in terms of the Blattberg/Deighton model).
</p>
<p>26.2.2 Cohort Models
</p>
<p>At any point in time, the customer base consists of customers acquired at
various times in the past, i.e., different cohorts. Equations 26.1 or 26.10 could
form the basis for such a cohort model, since they model the cohort ac-
quired in period t. Gupta et al. (2004a) develop their own cohort-specific
model2:
</p>
<p>LTVk =
nk
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)k
</p>
<p>&infin;&sum;
t=k
</p>
<p>mt&minus;k
rt&minus;k
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)t&minus;k
&minus; nkck
</p>
<p>(1 + δ)k
(26.11)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>LTVk = Lifetime value of cohort k, the customers who will be acquired k
periods in the future. k is numbered from 0 to &infin;.
</p>
<p>nk = The initial number of customers in cohort k.
mt&minus;k = The profit contribution of cohort k in period t. Note that for a given
</p>
<p>k, t goes from k to &infin;, so t&minus; k goes from 0 to &infin;.
rt&minus;k = Percentage of cohort k that is still a customer in period t. Note this
</p>
<p>is based on the simple retention model.
ck = Average acquisition costs per customer in cohort k.
δ = Discount factor.
</p>
<p>The model does not include a specific term for retention spending. This how-
ever could be easily added &ndash; the profit contribution term mt&minus;k could be
expressed as (mt&minus;k &minus; Rt&minus;k). One would also require a retention response
model r = f(R). We will optimize a similar model in Sect. 26.3.4.
</p>
<p>26.2.3 Type II Tobit Models
</p>
<p>Thomas (2001) introduced Type II Tobit models to modeling acquisition
and retention, consisting of a &ldquo;selection&rdquo; equation governing whether the
</p>
<p>2 See Chapter 7 for a discussion of the application of this model to customer base valua-
tion.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.2 Modeling Acquisition and Retention 683
</p>
<p>customer is acquired, and a &ldquo;regression&rdquo; equation for lifetime duration. Her
acquisition model is:
</p>
<p>z&lowast;i = α
&prime;
svi + &micro;is (26.12a){
</p>
<p>zi = 1 if z&lowast;i &gt; 0
zi = 0 if z&lowast;i &le; 0
</p>
<p>(26.12b)
</p>
<p>The term zi denotes whether or not prospect i is acquired. This depends on
the value of the &ldquo;latent&rdquo; variable z&lowast;i . Equations 26.12a&ndash;b define a probit model
of whether or not a prospect will be acquired. The independent variables vi
include prospect characteristics and firm&rsquo;s marketing efforts. Thomas allows
the response parameters αs to vary by customer segment.
</p>
<p>The customer&rsquo;s lifetime duration is modeled as:
</p>
<p>y&lowast;i = β
&prime;
sxi + εis (26.13a){
</p>
<p>yi = ci if y&lowast;i &ge; ci
yi = y&lowast;i if y
</p>
<p>&lowast;
i &lt; ci
</p>
<p>(26.13b)
</p>
<p>Customer lifetime, yi, is observed only if the customer is acquired.
Equation 26.13b accounts for data censoring, that is, several customers are
still customers when the data collection period ends (ci periods after the
customer is acquired). The xi&rsquo;s in Equation 26.13a include customer charac-
teristics and retention efforts expended after the customer has been acquired.
Note that response to these variables depends on the market segment s, so
βs is subscripted by s.
</p>
<p>The final piece is the behavior of the error terms in Equations 26.12a and
26.13a. These are assumed to follow a bivariate normal distribution:
</p>
<p>{εis, &micro;is} &sim; BVN {0̄, Σ} (26.14a)
</p>
<p>Σ =
{
σ2εs ρs
ρs 1
</p>
<p>}
(26.14b)
</p>
<p>The non-zero correlation between acquisition and retention error terms allows
unobserved variables determining acquisition and duration to be correlated.
For example, a variable such as customer preference would not be measured,
but would drive both acquisition and retention.
</p>
<p>Because of the correlation between the error terms, it is necessary to esti-
mate the model jointly (Wooldridge 2002). This is analogous to the need to
estimate recursive regression models jointly if their error terms are correlated.
In summary, Thomas&rsquo; model captures the following key phenomena:
</p>
<p>&bull; Different drivers (vi and xi) govern acquisition and retention.
&bull; There are segments of customers; each responds differently to the various
</p>
<p>drivers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>684 26 Acquisition and Retention Management
</p>
<p>&bull; Data for customer lifetime duration may be right-censored because many
customers may still be customers at the end of the data collection period.
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition and retention are linked in two ways: First, the same drivers
may govern these processes, albeit with different effect (αs and βs may
differ for the same variable), and second, unobserved variables may be
correlated between equations.
</p>
<p>Thomas (2001) applied her model to a sample of 2,300 customers who were
members of a service organization serving airplane pilots. Customers must re-
new their membership each year, and Thomas uses the acquisition equation to
describe whether or not the customer renews. Thomas used several variables
to describe the renewal (acquisition) process and the lifetime process (how
long the customer remained a customer). These include customer character-
istics (level of pilot certificate earned by the pilot), and marketing variables
(purchase of fee-based products offered by the organization; free products and
services used, such as credit card; and free premiums and rewards received
by the members).
</p>
<p>Thomas found two segments and that different variables drove acquisition
and lifetime of each segment. Segment 1 was responsive to credit cards, pre-
miums, and legal advice in sustaining their lifetime, whereas Segment 2 was
only responsive to premiums. Customer renewal was influenced by type of
pilot certificate, with commercially-licensed pilots more likely to be renewed
in Segment 1. Thomas then used her model to evaluate the financial impact
of various marketing tactics used by the organization, using the marketing
variables v and x in Equations 26.12 and 26.13. She found that special ser-
vices and add-on selling had a positive impact on profits, whereas rewards
had a negative impact.
</p>
<p>Thomas&rsquo; (2001) model was extended by Reinartz et al. (2005) who added
a profit equation. Their model can be expressed as:
</p>
<p>Acquisition:
</p>
<p>z&lowast;i = α
&prime;
svi + &micro;is (26.15a){
</p>

Equations 26.15 and 26.16, capturing acquisition and lifetime, are a standard
Type II Tobit (Wooldridge 2002). Equation 26.17 is the key addition, repre-
senting customer profitability. Note that customer lifetime duration is used as
a driver of customer profitability. The profitability equation, along with the
selection and lifetime equations, also have their own drivers (xL,v, and xD).
Since the application is to a non-contractural setting, there is no formal way
to know whether the relationship is still active. However, the authors used
an approach proposed by Allenby et al. (1999), which computes the expected
time until the next purchase. If that time exceeds the actual time elapsed,
the customer is still considered active. If a purchase has not occurred by the
expected time, the relationship is considered to have terminated at the last
purchase.
</p>
<p>Reinartz et al. (2005) apply the model to a &ldquo;large, multinational, B-
to-B high-tech manufacturer.&rdquo; Data were available for 12,024 prospects,
and of those, 2,908 were acquired. The independent variables included the
type and number of contacts made through face-to-face sales calls, tele-
phone, e-mail, and Internet. These variables applied both to prospect-
ing (Equation 26.15) and the two customer performance equations (26.16
and 26.17). In addition, the authors considered the total amount of dol-
lars spent on acquisition and retention for each customer. These variables
could be computed for a given set of contacts, although the same acqui-
sition and retention dollars could map to a different profile of contacts.
It was for this reason that both variables are included in the same model
equations. The authors also had measures of customer-initiated contacts,
the degree of cross-buying, transaction frequency, and customer share-of-
wallet. Finally, the authors considered variables characterizing the cus-
tomer&rsquo;s firm, such as industry type, annual sales revenue, and size of the
firm.
</p>
<p>The authors estimated their model and found several results:
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition dollars increase acquisition rate (Equation 26.15) with de-
creasing returns (a linear term had a positive sign while a quadratic
term had a negative sign). This supports the Blattberg and Deighton
model.
</p>
<p>&bull; Retention dollars increase customer duration (Equation 26.16) with de-
creasing returns (a linear term had a positive sign while a quadratic
term had a negative sign). This also supports the Blattberg and Deighton
model.
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition and retention dollars increase customer profitability
(Equation 26.17), again at decreasing rates. Note this is apart from</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>686 26 Acquisition and Retention Management
</p>
<p>their effect on acquisition and lifetime. This is a very interesting result,
suggesting that spending more money to acquire and retain customers
has an impact on profits beyond the mere act of acquiring and retaining
them. This might occur through larger expenditure levels and greater
propensity to cross-buy.
</p>
<p>&bull; All contacts (face-to-face, telephone, e-mail, and Internet) had positive
impact on acquisition, lifetime duration, and profits. This is as expected.
In addition, there were some positive interactions between contacts. For
example, there was positive synergy between e-mail and telephone as well
as face-to-face contacts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cross-buying enhances customer duration. The more products the cus-
tomer buys from the firm, the longer the customer stays with the firm.
This is an important confirmation of the role of cross-selling in enhancing
lifetime (see Chapters 21, 29).
</p>
<p>The Reinartz et al. (2005) model is an important extension of Thomas
(2001) because it links acquisition, retention (in the form of lifetime
duration), and profits. It suggests several rich extensions. First is the
method of handling duration in a non-contractual setting. The au-
thors follow a methodology by Allenby et al. (1999), but further re-
search would be useful. Second, the authors include both acquisition
/retention dollars and contact strategy in the same equation, even though
acquisition/retention dollars follow by definition from the contact strat-
egy. Econometrically, this should have induced perfect collinearity because
the acquisition or retention dollars would be linear combinations of the
contact variables. But evidently this was not a problem, perhaps because
not all acquisition and retention dollars were accounted for. Third, the
authors measure the impact of duration on profitability, but another ap-
proach would be to model duration and expenditures separately and then
combine them to obtain lifetime value. Finally, the model does not trace
out the dynamics by which expenditures and purchases occur over time.
This might be useful for period-by-period optimization for acquisition and
retention.
</p>
<p>One model that might address the last two issues would be as follows:
Acquisition:
</p>
<p>z&lowast;i = β
&prime;xai + &micro;i (26.19a)
</p>
<p>zi =

The lifetime value of the customer could be written as:
</p>
<p>LTV =
&infin;&sum;
t=1
</p>
<p>wityit
(1 + d)t&minus;1
</p>
<p>(26.23)
</p>
<p>Equation 26.19 could be used to calculate whether the customer is acquired.
This could be used to compute customer equity aLTV&minus;A. Finally, retention
costs could be explicitly included and either LTV or customer equity could
be optimized over time. This just sketches the approach; obviously there is a
need to develop and test this model. Its potential is to provide (1) estimates
of the drivers of acquisition, retention, and expenditure, and (2) a platform
for optimizing expenditures over time.
</p>
<p>26.2.4 Competitive Models
</p>
<p>The acquisition and retention models reviewed so far omit explicit consid-
eration of competition. This is because most firms do not have data on
their competitors&rsquo; customer behavior nor do they have data on competi-
tor&rsquo;s marketing activity. Fruchter and Zhang (2004) developed a model of
acquisition and retention that includes competition. Their purpose was to
develop insights on theoretical equilibrium levels of acquisition and retention
spending. The model represents a firm&rsquo;s share as that arising from re-
tained customers plus that arising from acquired customers. Marketing
expenditures serve to retain customers or acquire them. These expendi-
tures can be viewed as defensive or offensive.3 The market share equations
</p>
<p>3 In fact, this is how Fruchter and Zhang (2004) view them. We view them as retention and
acquisition expenditures, and redefine notation to reflect this &ndash; using &ldquo;a&rdquo; for acquisition
rather than &ldquo;o&rdquo; for offensive, and &ldquo;r&rdquo; for retention rather than &ldquo;d&rdquo; for defensive.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>688 26 Acquisition and Retention Management
</p>
<p>are as follows:
</p>
<p>xkr (t) = firm k&rsquo;s share due to retained customers. (26.24a)
xka(t) = firm k&rsquo;s share due to acquired customers. (26.24b)
xk(t) = xkr (t) + xka(t) = firm k&rsquo;s market share (26.24c)
</p>
<p>The term k signifies the firm, and Fruchter and Zhang (2004) assume two
firms (k = 1, 2). The role of marketing in determining these shares is ex-
pressed as follows:
</p>
<p>ρrk (δ
r
k(t)xkr (t))
</p>
<p>(1/2) = effectiveness of firm k&rsquo;s actions in retaining
customers = Erk(t). (26.25a)
</p>
<p>ρak (δ
a
k(t)xka(t))
</p>
<p>(1/2) = effectiveness of firm k&rsquo;s actions in attracting
customers = Eak (t). (26.25b)
</p>
<p>farkj (t) = E
a
k (t)&minus; Erj (t) = firm k&rsquo;s advantage in marketing effectiveness
</p>
<p>in acquiring customers from firm j. (26.25c)
farjk (t) = E
</p>
<p>a
j (t)&minus; Erk(t) = firm j&rsquo;s advantage in marketing effectiveness
</p>
<p>in acquiring customers from firm k. (26.25d)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>δ(t) = acquisition (a) or retention (r) expenditures per customer for firm k
in period t. Therefore, δ(t) &times; x(t) = total acquisition or retention expen-
ditures. The authors assume decreasing returns (the 1/2 exponent).
</p>
<p>ρ = effectiveness of firm k&rsquo;s acquisition or retention expenditures.
</p>
<p>Firm k&rsquo;s advantage in acquiring customers from firm j (farkj ) will be higher
to the extent that firm k spends a lot on acquisition (δx), that the spending
is effective (ρ), and firm j spends little on retention and what it does spend
is ineffective. The authors model the change in market share over time as
follows:
</p>
<p>ẋkr (t) = f
ar
kj (t)[xk(t)&minus; xkr (t)]&minus; farjk (t)xkr (t) (26.26a)
</p>
<p>ẋka(t) = f
ar
kj (t)[xj(t)&minus; xka(t)]&minus; farjk (t)xka(t) (26.26b)
</p>
<p>Note that ẋ stands for the derivative of market share with respect to time, or
the change in market share over time. Equation 26.26a describes how share
due to retained customers evolves; Equation 26.26b shows how share due
to acquired customers evolves. Equation 26.26a is reasoned as follows: Firm
k&rsquo;s share among retained customers increases if they can convert newly ac-
quired customers to repeat customers (first term) and prevent losses among
current customers by overcoming firm j&rsquo;s acquisition efforts (second term).
Equation 26.26b is reasoned as follows: Firm k&rsquo;s share from acquired cus-
tomers increases if its acquisition efforts are successful among the pool of</p>

</p>
<p>potential switchers (the first term) and if it can prevent firm j from ac-
quiring its recently acquired customers (second term). Equations 26.26a and
26.26b add up to the following intuitive result:
</p>
<p>ẋk(t) = farkj (t) [1&minus; xk(t)]&minus; farjk [xk(t)] (26.27)
Equation 26.27 says that firm k&rsquo;s share grows to the extent that it has an
acquisition marketing superiority over its competitor j and firm j has a
higher share (there are many customers available) and to the extent that
firm j has weak acquisition efforts so that it cannot acquire firm k&rsquo;s current
customers.
</p>
<p>Fruchter and Zhang (2004) assume customers contribute on average qk and
that each firm attempts to maximize its profits by optimizing its acquisition
and retention expenditures over time. The authors solve the resulting model
as an optimal control problem. Their main findings are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition and retention spending as defined by the δ&rsquo;s depend on the
effectiveness of firm k&rsquo;s spending relative to firm j.
</p>
<p>&bull; Retention spending increases as the value of customers, captured by qk
increases.
</p>
<p>&bull; Large share firms should spend more on retention and small share firms
should spend more on acquisition. This is an intuitive result but shows
that not all firms should have the same acquisition and retention strategy,
and market share is a key determinant of that strategy.
</p>
<p>One can think of obvious improvements in the Fruchter/Zhang analysis. For
example, customer contribution qk could be a function of marketing expen-
ditures. Also, including a &ldquo;lock-in&rdquo; term, namely a constant in the retention
marketing equation, might result in less competition, since it becomes more
difficult to acquire a competitor&rsquo;s customers. Finally, the model assumes a fi-
nite pool of customers, whereas in many markets the customer base is growing
over time.
</p>
<p>Fruchter and Zhang (2004) offer a unique perspective on the competitive
determinants of acquisition and retention expenditures. They show that mar-
ket share is a key determinant of these expenditures, and that acquisition and
retention expenditure decisions should consider expected competitive expen-
ditures. Future research needs to expand upon and estimate the model to
learn how these forces play out in practice.

<p>26.2.5 Summary: Lessons on How to Model
Acquisition and Retention
</p>
<p>We have examined four types of acquisition/retention models: (1) the
Blattberg/Deighton customer equity model, (2) the Thomas Type II To-
bit model, (3) cohort models, and (4) competitive models. This examination</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>690 26 Acquisition and Retention Management
</p>
<p>suggests the essential phenomena to include when modeling acquisition and
retention:
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition and retention rates are fundamental. The key quantities to be
modeled are the percentage of the firm&rsquo;s prospects that is acquired, and
what percentage of its current customers is retained.
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition and retention rates are functions of marketing. Marketing ex-
penditures influence acquisition and retention rates. There is evidence the
impact of these expenditures has decreasing returns (Reinartz et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition and retention are integrated. The relationship is quantified by
the equation, Customer Equity = aLTV &minus;A. LTV depends on the reten-
tion rate which in turn is a function of retention marketing expenditures.
Statistically, the need to integrate the phenomena comes through correla-
tions between acquisition and retention rates due to correlations between
unobserved variables. This says that selectivity-type models are impor-
tant for empirically estimating acquisition/retention models (e.g., Thomas
2001; Reinartz et al. 2005).
</p>
<p>&bull; Retention consists of two components &ndash; will the customer stay with the
company and how much will the customer spend. The &ldquo;staying&rdquo; aspect
has received much more attention than the spending aspect, but they
both need to be modeled.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer segments exist. This is brought out by the Thomas&rsquo; (2001) Type
II Tobit model.
</p>
<p>&bull; The customer base evolves over time. This is seen most directly by the cus-
tomer equity (Equation 26.10) and cohort models (Equation 26.11). The
customer base evolves for several reasons: First, the pool of available
prospects change over time. Second, customers are never 100% retained, so
firms are constantly losing customers. Third, retention rates may change
over time due either to retention expenditures. We will see how this can
be optimized in the next section.
</p>
<p>&bull; Competition plays a role in acquisition and retention strategy. Typical em-
pirical models of acquisition and retention ignore competition. However,
the empirically observed acquisition and retention expenditures of the firm
are the result of a competitive interaction where acquisition and retention
expenditures are the main weapons. Accordingly, to ignore competition can
create an endogeneity problem in acquisition and retention expenditures.
</p>
<p>26.3 Optimal Acquisition and Retention Spending
</p>
<p>In this section we use various models of acquisition and retention to de-
rive optimal spending levels. We consider the Blattberg/Deighton model
first. This leads to insights regarding the notion that since it &ldquo;costs less&rdquo;
to retain a customer than acquire one, more money should be put into cus-
tomer retention. We then investigate a multi-period optimization based on</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>26.3 Optimal Acquisition and Retention Spending 691
</p>
<p>the Blattberg/Deighton model. Finally, we discuss the optimization of the
Reinartz et al. (2005) model.
</p>
<p>26.3.1 Optimizing the Blattberg/Deighton Model with
No Budget Constraint
</p>
<p>To optimize the Blattberg/Deighton model, we assume the firm has current
customers and prospects. The optimization therefore takes the following form:
</p>
<p>Max
A,R
</p>
<p>Π = Np
</p>
<p>[
a (M &minus;R)
</p>
<p>(
1 + d
</p>
<p>1 + d&minus; r
)
&minus;A
</p>
<p>]
+Nc
</p>
<p>[
(M &minus;R)
</p>
<p>(
1 + d
</p>
<p>1 + d&minus; r
)]
</p>
<p>(26.28a)
</p>
<p>such that:
</p>
<p>a = ca(1&minus; e&minus;kaA) (26.28b)
r = cr(1&minus; e&minus;krR) (26.28c)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Np = Number of prospects available to the firm.
Nc = Number of current customers for the firm.
</p>
<p>The other terms are defined in Sect. 26.2.1. The decision variables are how
much to spend on acquisition and retention (A&amp;R). These expenditures drive
the acquisition and retention rates through the marketing efficiency Equa-
tions 26.28b and 26.28c.
</p>
<p>Table 26.1 presents illustrative results. The example assumes the company
has 1,000,000 prospects and 10,000 current customers. Acquisition and re-
tention spending efficiency is about the same (ka = 0.1 and kr = 0.08) but
the acquisition ceiling is much lower than the retention ceiling (ca = 0.1 and
cr = 0.7). Profit contribution per customer, gross of retention expenditures,
is $200, and the discount rate is 10% per year.
</p>
<p>The optimal solution4 yields $21,083,762 in profits by spending $14.14 per
prospect on acquisition and $38.01 per customer on retention. The result is an
acquisition rate of 7.6% and a retention rate of 66.7%. The optimal acquisition
rate is 76% of the ceiling (7.6%/10.0%) and the optimal retention rate is 95%
of the ceiling (66.7%/70%). The optimal solution prescribes acquisition and
retention rates lower than their ceilings due to decreasing returns with respect
to spending on these efforts.
</p>
<p>While spending per prospect is $14.14, average acquisition cost is $186.81
per acquired customer. This is higher than the average retention cost, which is
$38.01. Using Equations 26.6 and 26.9, one can compute the marginal costs of

acquisition cost turns out to be $411.09 and the marginal retention cost turns
out to be $373.72. Note that at optimal spending, the lifetime value of the
customer is $411.09. As we shall show rigorously, it is no coincidence that
at optimal spending, optimal marginal acquisition cost = LTV , and optimal
marginal retention cost = LTV/(1 + d).
</p>
<p>Figures 26.5 and 26.6 show how optimal acquisition and retention spending
change as a function of the acquisition and retention response equations.
Figure 26.5 shows that as the acquisition ceiling increases, optimal acquisition
expenditures (A) increase at a decreasing rate, optimal retention expenditures
(R) remain the same, and profits increase. These results make sense. First, as
the ceiling increases, the marginal cost of acquiring a customer decreases for
a given level of expenditure, hence more money can be spent on acquisition
and more customers will be acquired. Second, this has no impact on retention
spending because the optimal lifetime value of a customer, and hence the
optimal retention spending level, is independent of how many customers are
acquired (note we are not in a budgeted situation).
</p>
<p>Figure 26.5b shows that as acquisition efficiency increases, profits increase,
and acquisition dollars increase to a point, and then decrease. The reason for
this presumably is that when acquisition spending becomes highly efficient,</p>

<p>one reaches the acquisition ceiling, or very close to it, with less and less
acquisition expenditure, so that at high efficiency, one can spend less on
acquisition and still have a huge acquisition rate.
</p>
<p>Figure 26.6a shows that as the retention ceiling increases, more is spent
on retention and on acquisition. That more is spent on retention is certainly
no surprise. But it is interesting that more is also spent on acquisition. This
is because with a higher retention ceiling and more spent on retention, LTV
increases, and thus it is worthwhile to invest in acquisition because higher
LTV allows the higher acquisition costs to pay out.</p>

</p>
<p>Figure 26.6b shows that as retention efficiency increases, retention costs
first increase and then decrease. The decrease occurs for similar reasons as in
the case of acquisition &ndash; the increased efficiency allows the firm to attain very
high retention rates at low levels of spending. Therefore it is not necessary to
spend as much on retention. Acquisition spending goes up because at higher
retention efficiency, retention rates are high, so LTV is higher, so higher levels
of acquisition pay out.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting insight from the above analysis is the asym-
metric relationship between acquisition and retention expenditures. If acqui-
sition response improves, either through a higher ceiling or greater efficiency,
acquisition spending changes but retention spending is unaffected. However,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.3 Optimal Acquisition and Retention Spending 695
</p>
<p>if retention response improves, retention spending changes and so does ac-
quisition spending. This is because as will be formalized in the next section,
acquisition costs are optimal when the marginal cost of acquisition equals the
lifetime value of the customer. If the acquisition response curve improves, it
makes it worthwhile to change acquisition expenditures to keep this equal-
ity in balance. However, the optimal retention rate is not affected by how
many customers are acquired, so the optimal retention expenditure remains
the same. In contrast, when retention response changes, LTV changes, and
so acquisition costs must adjust to re-equilibrate the relationship between
acquisition spending and LTV.
</p>
<p>26.3.2 The Relationship Among Acquisition and
Retention Costs, LTV, and Optimal Spending:
If Acquisition &ldquo;Costs&rdquo; Exceed Retention
&ldquo;Costs&rdquo;, Should the Firm Focus on Retention?
</p>
<p>Often companies do not explicitly measure acquisition and retention response
curves, and so cannot formally optimize expenditures. They look for rules of
thumb for guiding these expenditures. One of the more common such heuris-
tics is that since it costs more to acquire than retain a customer, firms should
focus on retention. Pfeifer (2005) makes three crucial points: (1) One must
define more rigorously what is meant by costs &ndash; average costs or marginal
costs. (2) Marginal costs, not average costs, are key to determining how much
should be spent on either acquisition or retention. (3) Acquisition spending
should be at a level such that the marginal cost of acquisition equals the
lifetime value of the customer, and retention spending should also be at a
level such that the marginal cost of retention should equal the lifetime value
of the customer.5
</p>
<p>Point (1) simply emphasizes that we need to be precise in defining costs,
as in all managerial situations. As we have seen earlier, average costs and
marginal costs vary differently as the response curves change. Point (2) is
the most crucial. Average costs reflect what the firm is currently spending.
But we want to determine whether that current spending is optimal or not.
What matters therefore is how much it would cost to change the acquisition or
retention rate. This is the domain of marginal cost, i.e., the crucial question is,
what would it cost to acquire an additional customer, or retain an additional
customer. Once we are thinking in terms of marginal costs, Point (3) follows
intuitively. In terms of acquisition, if we can acquire an additional customer
for an $200 (marginal cost equals $200) and the LTV is $300, we should spend
</p>
<p>5 Note that our actual result will differ because of the assumed timing of expenditures
(see Footnote 1), and therefore, we will find the optimal R = LTV/(1 + d) rather than
R = LTV (see Equations 26.30 and 26.31).</p>

<p>that $200. In fact, we should spend until the marginal cost equals LTV. The
same logic follows for marginal retention costs, although when we derive the
result formally, we will differ by a factor of (1 + d) because of the timing of
the benefits of additional retention.
</p>
<p>We illustrate the above principles in Table 26.2, which assumes the same
parameters as in Table 26.1. However, it assumes that at the current time,
the company is spending $8.00 per prospect and $38.01 per customer. This
results in an average acquisition cost of $145.28 per acquired customer and
retention cost of $38.01 per customer. Note (average) acquisition costs exceed
(average) retention costs, so it is tempting to recommend spending more on
retention per customer. However, we see that the LTV is $411.09, which is
much higher than the marginal cost ($222.55) of acquiring another customer.
It costs us $222.55 to acquire another customer, and that customer is worth
$411.09. We should put money into acquisition, which is reflected in the
&ldquo;Optimal&rdquo; column, which is the same result as Table 26.1. In fact, we can

optimal acquisition spending is determined at the point where marginal ac-
quisition cost equals LTV, and optimal retention spending is determined at

<p>(1 + d)
(26.31)
</p>
<p>At optimality, the marginal cost of retaining another customer should equal
LTV/(1 + d). The reason for the (1 + d) term in the denominator is that in
our formulation of the Blattberg/Deighton model, the benefit of retaining an
additional customer occurs in the next period, i.e., the benefit of a higher
retention expenditure is that we are more likely to retain the customer in the
next period. This is why in Tables 26.1 and 26.2, at optimality, the marginal
retention cost = $373.72 = LTV/(1 + d) = $411.09/(1 + 0.1).
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the lessons from this exercise are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Marginal costs, not average costs, are relevant to guiding optimal acquisi-
tion and retention spending. Average costs provide information acquisition
and retention spending only to the extent that under some circumstances,
average costs may equal marginal costs within the range of actions being
considered.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>698 26 Acquisition and Retention Management
</p>
<p>&bull; In an unconstrained budget, static setting, marginal acquisition costs
should equal LTV, and marginal retention costs should equal LTV/(1+d).
</p>
<p>Note the proviso that we assume an unconstrained budget. We also have not
considered potential interactions between acquisition and retention over time.
We consider these issues in Sects. 26.3.3&ndash;26.3.5. Meanwhile, the proposition
provides a well-grounded &ldquo;first-cut&rdquo; at optimal expenditures, and strongly
suggests that it is inappropriate to use average costs as a basis for setting
acquisition and retention expenditures.
</p>
<p>In practice, implementing the proposition is hampered because compa-
nies often do not know their marginal costs, because this requires acquisi-
tion and retention curves. Without knowledge of the acquisition response
curve, the company might assume that for a given acquisition channel, av-
erage cost = marginal cost. For example, if the firm distributes 1,000,000
CD&rsquo;s at a cost of $100,000 and acquires 1,000 customers, its average acqui-
sition cost is $100. It may be reasonable to assume that if it distributed
500,000 additional CD&rsquo;s, it would acquire customers at the same rate, i.e.,
500 more customers. The cost would be $50,000, so the marginal acquisi-
tion cost would be $100 per customer. Note, however, that this assumes we
have not reached the decreasing returns portion of the acquisition response
curve.
</p>
<p>While we might see some justification for using average acquisition cost
as a proxy for marginal cost, extrapolating average retention costs in this
way would be more tenuous. Additional retention costs are being spent on
the same customer, so most certainly will be subject to decreasing returns.
In the acquisition case, we are simply reaching 1,500,000 prospects rather
than 1,000,000. In the retention case, we are spending more on our 10,000
current customers. We can&rsquo;t simply extrapolate as we did in the acquisition
case because it will be the same customers who are the subject of the ad-
ditional expenditure. The company needs to estimate a retention response
curve or conduct market tests to gauge the impact of additional retention
spending.

</p>
<p>Equation 26.32d is the budget constraint. Table 26.3 shows the optimal solu-
tion using the same parameters as in Table 26.1, except now with a budget
constraint of $10,000,000. The table shows that optimal spending is now $7.78
per prospect in acquisition costs, and $34.63 per customer in retention costs.
These numbers are lower than the optimal spending without budget con-
straints. Total A&amp;R spending was $14,136,358 + $3,256,792 = $17,393,150
in the unconstrained case. In the constrained case total A&amp;R spending is
$7,781,287 + $2,218,713 = $10,000,000.

<p>Profits have decreased from $21,083,762 to $18,478,670. This makes sense
because if a $10,000,000 budget yielded the highest profit, we would have

<p>by graphing the budget constraint on the x-axis versus the total budget spent.
One sees that the amount spent on acquisition and retention increases with
larger budgets, up to the point where we reach the unconstrained optimal
spending ($17,393,150). So, quite sensibly, as budgets increase, firms will
spend more on acquisition and retention, up to the optimal level of spending
as would be determined from the unconstrained case.
</p>
<p>Figure 26.8a shows how optimal acquisition spending per prospect and op-
timal retention costs per customer change as budgets increase. As the budget
increases, these costs increase until we reach the optimal budget, $17,393,150.
Figure 26.8b shows how marginal costs at optimal spending change as a func-
tion of the budget. At the optimal budget the marginal acquisition cost equals
lifetime value of the customer, and marginal retention cost is somewhat lower
(by a factor of 1 + d). Before we reach the optimal budget, both marginal
acquisition marginal retention costs increase convexly. LTV hardly increases
at all once it reaches about $400. It seems that in this case, retention gets
first priority and the amount is spent that increases retention rate so that
LTV is about at its optimal maximum. Then as the budget increases, it is
used disproportionately to acquire more customers. This result may due to
a function of the higher ceiling for retention rates. This encourages the com-
pany to spend scarce resources on retention, since they rapidly increase LTV.
Then, once the firm runs into steeply increasing marginal retention costs, it
spends money on acquiring customers.
</p>
<p>In summary, we have learned the following regarding optimal acquisition
and retention expenditures in a budgeted situation:
</p>
<p>&bull; Budgets are sub-optimal in that they constrain spending so that the firm
does not achieve the optimal marginal cost/LTV relationship derived in
the proposition.</p>

<p>702 26 Acquisition and Retention Management
</p>
<p>26.3.4 Optimizing a Multi-Period, Budget-Constrained
Cohort Model
</p>
<p>We derive optimal acquisition and retention spending for the budgeted case
in a multi-period setting. The model is as follows:
</p>
<p>Max
AtRt
</p>
<p>{
T&sum;
</p>
<p>t=1
</p>
<p>Πt
(1 + d)(t&minus;1)
</p>
<p>}
(26.33a)
</p>
<p>such that:
</p>
<p>Πt = (Nct +Nat)&times;Mt &minus;At &minus;Rt (26.33b)
Nct =
</p>
<p>{
Nc1 t = 1
(Nc,t&minus;1 +Na,t&minus;1)&times; rt&minus;1 t = 2, . . . , T (26.33c)
</p>
<p>Nat = Npt &times; at (26.33d)
at = ca(1&minus; e&minus;kaAt) (26.33e)
rt = cf + cr(1&minus; e&minus;krRt) (26.33f)
</p>
<p>At +Rt = B (26.33g)
</p>
<p>Equation 26.33a is the objective function. Note the finite horizon T . In these
situations, it is common to find &ldquo;end game&rdquo; solutions, which in this case
could mean no spending on retention in period T because its benefits are
not felt until period T + 1. We therefore will optimize the model for T = 4
but report the results for t = 1, 2, and 3, in the spirit of deriving a 3-year
marketing plan.
</p>
<p>Equation 26.33b is the per-period profit equation. Note that each period we
begin with Nct current customers and acquire Nat new customers. We assume
that these customers contribute on averageMt and the total costs of acquiring
Nat customers is At and the amount spent on customer retention is Rt.
</p>
<p>Equations 26.33c and 26.33d keep track of how many customers we have in
each period. We start off withNc1 customers and acquireNa1 customers in pe-
riod 1 (via Equation 26.34d; Npt is the number of prospects). Our total profit
contribution in period 1 is therefore (Nc1 +Na1)&times;M1 via Equation 26.34b.
The second part of Equation 26.34c shows how many customers we retain for
the beginning of the next period.
</p>
<p>Equations 26.33e and 26.33f are our familiar acquisition and retention re-
sponse functions. We add a floor effect for retention response. Even if the
firm spends $0 on retention, it will retain a fraction cf of its customers in
the next period. In the optimization, we assume cf = ca = ka = kr = 0.1,
and the retention ceiling is cr = 0.8. So if the firm spends an infinite amount
on retention, its retention rate would be 0.1 + 0.8 = 0.9. If it spends nothing
on retention, it would still retain 0.10 = 10% of its customers. We assume
contribution margin, Mt, is $200, and the discount rate d is 10%. The budget
(B) is $10,000,000.
</p>
<p>Table 26.4 shows the results. The company starts off with 50,000 customers
(Nc1) and 1,000,000 prospects (Np1). It spends $7.36 per prospect, for a total</p>

for a total of $2,643,542. This adds up to the budget constraint of $10,000,000.
The optimal spending results in an 85,744/102,080 = 84% retention rate and
a 52,080/1,000,000 = 5.2% acquisition rate.
</p>
<p>Note that over time, the company is building up its customer base, 50,000
at the beginning of Year 1, to 111,791 at the beginning of Year 3. It will enter
Year 4 with 129,364 customers. Interestingly, however, the amount spent on
acquisition decreases over time. One reason is that when the firm acquires
customers in Year 1, this increases the number of customers retained and then
subject to retention efforts in Year 2. This necessitates higher retention spend-
ing and hence lower acquisition spending. This illustrates the multi-period
interaction between acquisition and retention. Expenditures on acquisition in
period 1 increase the &ldquo;retention burden&rdquo; in period 2, requiring more reten-
tion dollars in total and less spent on acquisition. The optimization finds a
&ldquo;happy median&rdquo; whereby retention rates are maintained relatively high yet
money is still available for the ample pool of prospects. Retention rates go
from 84% (Year 1) to 83% (Year 2) to 81% (Year 3), so they are maintained
at pretty high levels.
</p>
<p>The marginal acquisition and retention costs are way below the customer
LTV of $1,692. The budget is clearly constraining what would be a higher op-
timal spending level. However, an additional factor is the finite horizon. Given
the relatively high retention rate (80%+), the customer&rsquo;s full lifetime lies out-
side the time horizon of the optimization. This is perhaps realistic for compa-
nies that have a 3-year planning horizon. They are sub-optimizing in the sense
that an infinite budget and infinite time horizon will yield higher discounted</p>

<p>profits, but the company has limited available funds so that it must resort to
budgeting. In addition, it cannot take on too long a planning horizon because
there is no guarantee the company will exist 4 years from now!
</p>
<p>Figure 26.9 shows the impact on Year 1, 2, and 3 spending as the number
of initial customers increases. In general, the larger the number of initial
customers, the greater the amount spent on retention. This is reminiscent
of the Fruchter and Zhang (2004) result that higher share companies should
spend more on retention. But in the case of Fig. 26.9, the emphasis on
current customers is because acquisition and retention are roughly equal in
efficiency yet retention has a higher ceiling, so the more customers on hand,
the more it pays to spend money on retaining them. Note that when the
number of initial customers is low, retention spending increases over time
as in Table 26.4. But when the number of initial customers is large, the
company invests a lot in them initially but then decreases that expenditure
over time. This may be because as more customers are acquired and the
retention burden becomes higher, it becomes harder to devote the money
to maintain high retention rates, so the firm lets up a little on retention
spending and allocates more to acquisition spending.
</p>
<p>In summary, this example shows the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Multi-period acquisition and planning models can be set up using the basic
Blattberg/Deighton&rsquo;s framework incorporated in a cohort model. The result</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.3 Optimal Acquisition and Retention Spending 705
</p>
<p>is a planning tool that can be used to derive a realistic limited horizon
marketing plan.
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition and retention interact over time. Heavy acquisition spending
in early periods can impose a retention burden that forces the firm to spend
more on retention in future periods. The opposite can also occur: Early
high retention spending levels can be difficult to maintain because even
at high spending, customers leave the company, so acquisition eventually
becomes important.
</p>
<p>&bull; Marginal acquisition and retention costs do not correspond to customer
LTV as we derived for the long-term, infinite budget case. The reasons
are: (1) the limited budget means that these marginal costs typically are
lower than LTV, and (2) the finite horizon means that the long-term value
of customers is not fully considered.
</p>
<p>26.3.5 Optimizing the Reinartz et al. (2005)
Tobit Model
</p>
<p>Reinartz et al. used their model to derive an optimal spending strategy for the
company that provided their data. The case is analogous to the un-budgeted
Blattberg/Deighton optimization in Sect. 26.3.1. The difference is the model
(Type II Tobit rather than the Blattberg/Deighton response functions) and
the fact that the decision variables are how much to spend on specific vehi-
cles (telephone, face-to-face, Internet, and e-mail), as well as acquisition and
retention in total. The authors optimized their model using the Solver add-on
for Excel, yielding several interesting findings:
</p>
<p>&bull; The optimal solution called for 21.1% of marketing to be spent on ac-
quisition and 78.9% to be spent on retention. Interestingly, the company
was actually spending these percentages. However, the level of spending
in total was much higher than the optimal level. This suggests that man-
agers overspend on marketing, but allocate the proportions correctly. The
reason for the overspending could be that the managers are risk-averse in
the sense that they are afraid of losing their customers, or that they are
taking into account competitive spending, which the Reinartz et al. model
(similar to most other empirical models) does not take into account.
</p>
<p>&bull; E-mail dominates the marketing effort, although it isn&rsquo;t particularly effec-
tive on a per-e-mail basis. The reason is that it is inexpensive. One way to
account for e-mail &ldquo;costs&rdquo; would be to include quadratic terms to represent
wearout, which would suggest an optimal pulsing strategy (Chapter 28).
Interestingly, however, the authors&rsquo; results suggested positive interactions
with telephone and face-to-face communications.
</p>
<p>&bull; Under-spending on retention is generally more costly in lost profits than
under-spending on acquisition, although it is particularly costly to under-
spend on both.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>706 26 Acquisition and Retention Management
</p>
<p>&bull; Over-spending on retention or acquisition does not hurt profits much. This
may suggest one reason why managers were indeed over-spending.
</p>
<p>&bull; While a small departure from the optimal spending does not hurt profits
much on a percentage basis, the total amount of lost profits can be large
because of the large number of customers. For example, Reinartz et al.
(p. 75) report that when the acquisition budget is 90% of optimal and the
retention budget is optimal, profits per customer are reduced by 0.03%.
However, the authors calculate across all customers, this can mean a loss
of $39.3 million in long-term profits.
</p>
<p>The above results show the richness of the Reinartz et al. approach. It is par-
ticularly attractive in its linking of particular marketing instruments (e-mail,
Internet, etc.) to acquisition and retention, and it ties together acquisition
and retention in a rich way as described earlier in Sect. 26.2.3. Further exten-
sions could consider optimal expenditures over time using a cohort approach
(Sect. 26.3.4).
</p>
<p>26.3.6 Summary: When Should We Spend More on
Acquisition or Retention?
</p>
<p>The optimizations discussed in this section suggest guidelines on when the
firm should spend more on acquisition or retention. These are just guidelines
because in only one case did we actually prove one of them, and that was for
a single-period model with an unconstrained budget. Further work is needed
to generalize these findings:
</p>
<p>&bull; The acquisition and retention response curves are key drivers of relative
and absolute spending. There are two components to these curves, (1) the
ceiling effect, i.e., the highest possible acquisition or retention rate, and
(2) efficiency, i.e., how fast we approach the ceiling by increasing spending.
To the extent that say acquisition is more responsive than the retention
(through either higher ceiling, higher efficiency, or both), more money will
be spent on acquisition. But there are four key parameters (efficiency and
ceiling for both acquisition and retention), and how these play out is dif-
ficult to predict and needs to be analyzed using optimization.
Two additional points should be noted. First, the emphasis in the literature
has been on acquisition and retention rates, but customer expenditures
(contribution), is also important. There is a response curve for expendi-
tures and this should be considered as well. Second, the parameters of the
response curve (efficiency and ceiling) can be influenced by policy. For ex-
ample, the objective of a loyalty program may be to improve the retention
response curve, i.e., make it more efficient or have a higher ceiling. Another
way to think of it is that different marketing activities have different re-
sponse curves. So, how the firm allocates its acquisition or retention money</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.3 Optimal Acquisition and Retention Spending 707
</p>
<p>across various marketing instruments determines its aggregate acquisition
or retention response curve. Aggregate response curves drive allocation,
but these curves can be determined by marketing decisions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Marginal cost, not average cost, should guide investments. This is because
average costs simply measure what we have achieved with expenditures
to date, whereas the question of whether we should spend more or less
depends on the change in acquired or retained customers per unit increase
or decrease in spending. This is the concept of marginal cost. Unfortu-
nately, marginal costs are usually more difficult to determine than average
costs. Average costs can be obtained from an A&amp;R budget. Marginal costs
require a response model or controlled tests of additional investments.
</p>
<p>&bull; In a single period, unlimited budget setting, increase spending on acqui-
sition until the marginal acquisition cost equals the lifetime value of the
customer. We derived this result analytically and stated it as a proposi-
tion (Sect. 26.3.2). We saw however that in multiple-period, limited budget
settings, the optimal spending level may yield marginal acquisition and re-
tention costs lower than LTV.
</p>
<p>&bull; In a single period, unlimited budget setting, increase spending on retention
until the marginal cost of retaining another customer equals the lifetime
value of the customer, divided by one plus the discount rate. The logic
behind this is the same as with acquisition. We should spend more on
retaining customers if the marginal cost of retaining another customer is
less than the (discounted) value that customer will provide in the future.
Again, however, this result may not hold in a limited budget, multiple
period setting.
</p>
<p>&bull; In a single-period, unlimited budget setting, improvements in acquisition
response affect acquisition investment but not retention investment. This
is because improvements in acquisition response determine how much the
firm must spend before the marginal cost of acquisition equals LTV, but
does not affect LTV itself.
</p>
<p>&bull; In a single-period, unlimited budget setting, improvements in retention re-
sponse affect both retention and acquisition investment. This is because
better retention response yields higher retention rates and higher LTV.
This in turn increases the amount one is willing to invest in acquisition,
since marginal acquisition costs are increasing in acquisition spending, but
we now have a higher LTV so can afford higher marginal acquisition costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Spend more as budgets increase, but monitor marginal costs to make sure
you don&rsquo;t overspend. Generally, as budgets increase, the firm should spend
more on acquisition and retention, the exact ratio determined by the re-
sponse curves as well as period-to-period interactions between acquisition
and retention &ndash; such as increasing future retention burdens. However, with
decreasing returns to expenditures, there eventually is a limit on how much
should be spent.
</p>
<p>&bull; Budgeting results in &ldquo;locally&rdquo; sub-optimal spending. Budgets yield lower
profits than unlimited budgets. However, there are reasons why companies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>708 26 Acquisition and Retention Management
</p>
<p>use budgets. They serve as a management control mechanism and take into
account the efforts of the entire company, not just the product line being
considered by the optimization.
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Retention burden&rdquo; can hold back acquisition spending in a multi-period,
limited budget setting. In a multi-period setting, there are interactions
between actions taken in year t and actions taken in year t + x. One
of these is &ldquo;retention burden.&rdquo; If a lot is spent on customer acquisition
in a given year, this increases the number of customers that &ldquo;demand&rdquo;
retention expenditures in future years. If initial acquisition is too high,
and if we have a limited budget, we may not be able to spend enough
on retaining customers in subsequent periods. An alternative may be to
spend less on acquisition initially, so that the customers who are acquired
can be retained effectively.
</p>
<p>&bull; Companies with a larger installed customer base should spend more on
retention, although perhaps decrease these expenditures over time. Current
customers typically have high retention rates, so at first it pays to invest in
these customers. However, over time, more current customers eventually
churn, and attention shifts to acquisition.
</p>
<p>Again, the above are just a set of guidelines based on the analyses in this
section. The most important theme is to illustrate the practicality of using
optimization to guide acquisition and retention spending, and to emphasize
the need for companies need to invest in learning response functions.
</p>
<p>26.4 Acquisition and Retention Budget Planning
</p>
<p>In this section we reinforce the &ldquo;Customer Management Marketing Budget&rdquo;
(CMMB), implicitly introduced in Table 26.4, as a planning tool.
</p>
<p>26.4.1 The Customer Management Marketing Budget
(CMMB)
</p>
<p>Table 26.5 portrays a template for the CMMB. This multi-period planning
tool consisting of three sections: Customers, A&amp;R Spending, and Profit. This
contrasts to a more typical marketing budget, which would consist of expen-
ditures and profits. The key contribution of the CMMB is that it keeps track
of the firm&rsquo;s customer base and shows where the marketing expenditures are
going &ndash; for acquisition or retention.
</p>
<p>The Customer section of the CMMB keeps count of current, lost, retained,
and acquired customers each year, along with prospects. It also tabulates
retention and acquisition rates. At a glance, the manager can examine the
growth or decline in the firm&rsquo;s customer base and its reasons. For example,</p>

Discounted profits $273,047,333 &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;
</p>
<p>a declining customer base could be the result of decreasing retention rates,
decreasing acquisition rates, or fewer prospects. The CMMB Spending section
shows acquisition and retention expenditures, and average expenditures per
acquisition or retention. In the case of Table 26.5, the total amount spent
on A&amp;R is increasing. This is because the customer base is increasing, thus
the retention burden is increasing, but the company is continuing to spend
the same amount per prospect and per current customer. The final section,
Profits, shows sales per customer, total sales, COGS, GS&amp;A (other than
A&amp;R), and total profits.
</p>
<p>The various entries in the CMMB can be linked to acquisition and response
functions, as they are in Table 26.4, which drew on Equations 26.33. However,
even without these underlying models, the simple layout of CMMB provides
a valuable portrait of the state of the firm from a CRM vantage point.
</p>
<p>26.4.2 Implementation Issues
</p>
<p>A challenge in implementing a CMMB is the calculation of acquisition
and retention costs. For example, is mass advertising part of acquisition or</p>

</p>
<p>retention? Probably both, and the firm would want to make an allocation,
either using a relatively ad hoc method based say on the number of customers
acquired and retained, or using acquisition and retention response curves that
show which aspect &ndash; acquisition or retention &ndash; is influenced by mass adver-
tising. While some marketing activities will be difficult to allocate, others
will be easy. For example, contacts of prospects are clearly acquisition costs;
contacts of current customers are clearly retention costs.
</p>
<p>Another issue of course is the allocation of overhead. Should for example
the salaries of the marketing staff be allocated to the A&amp;R portion of the
budget or to GS&amp;A? This is a debatable issue, relating to the variable versus
fixed-costing debate discussed in Chapter 6. Our stance is toward variable
costing, so we would enter only variable costs in the A&amp;R Spending section,
or at least separate variable from fixed costs. Obviously the A&amp;R section can
be made more specific, listing various vehicles such as e-mail, direct mail,
and various costs such as product fulfillment and variable salary costs. We
would not however allocate other GS&amp;A costs that are expected to be stable
over time, or are not a function of the number of customers. Activity-based
costing such as discussed in Chapter 5 might be of help in determining the
relevant costs.
</p>
<p>26.5 Acquisition and Retention Strategy: An Overall
Framework
</p>
<p>In closing this chapter, we step back from detailed optimizations and model-
ing and examine an overall framework for developing acquisition and reten-
tion strategy. Figure 26.10 provides this framework.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26.5 Acquisition and Retention Strategy: An Overall Framework 711
</p>
<p>Figure 26.10 shows three components: the environment, firm decisions, and
customer equity. The environment includes industry factors, competition, the
firm&rsquo;s goals and capabilities, and current and potential customers. Firm de-
cisions are both at the level of monetary expenditures on acquisition and
retention, and how that money should be allocated to various tactics (similar
to the Reinartz et al. and Blattberg et al. approaches). Note that the envi-
ronment determines these decisions, but that the decisions also determine the
environment. For example, growth in potential customers may cause the firm
to spend more on acquisition, but over time this decreases the level of poten-
tial customers, and this feeds back probably to an emphasis on retention.
</p>
<p>Firm decisions have a direct impact on customer equity &ndash; the net long-
term profitability of the firm&rsquo;s customer base. There are three key parameters
that govern this equity: the acquisition rate a, the retention rate r, and the
contribution level M . The firm&rsquo;s investment and tactical decisions have to
be designed to influence at least one of these three quantities. We have seen
throughout this chapter how the relationships between these three quantities
and marketing efforts (the firm decisions) can be modeled and optimized. We
have also seen how the A&amp;R budget can keep track of customer equity by
charting the customer base, A&amp;R expenditures, and profits over time.
</p>
<p>In summary, acquisition and retention can be attacked at a strategic level,
only considering aggregate expenditures over a long-term time horizon, or
at a tactical level, considering issues such as which particular marketing in-
struments to use for acquisition, retention, or profit contribution, and how
much to spend on them. In any case, the topic is challenging, both for the
researcher attempting to model and optimize this process, and the manager
attempting to develop and implement acquisition and retention decisions.</p>

<p>Designing Database
Marketing Communications
</p>
<p>Abstract When all the LTV calculations, predictive modeling, and acquisi-
tion and retention planning have been done, the firm ultimately must commu-
nicate with the customer. In this chapter, we discuss how to design database
marketing communications. We discuss the planning process for designing
communications, and devote most of the discussion to copy development and
media selection. We pay special attention to &ldquo;personalization,&rdquo; or individu-
alizing the message that is communicated to each customer.
</p>
<p>27.1 The Planning Process
</p>
<p>Figure 27.1 presents a planning process for designing database marketing
communication campaigns. The focus might be on a single campaign or a
program consisting of multiple campaigns. The four major steps are: Set
the Overall Plan, Develop Copy, Select and Schedule Media, and Evalu-
ate Results. We discuss the overall plan, copy, vehicle selection, and eval-
uation in this chapter, and scheduling, particularly for multiple campaigns,
in Chapter 28.
</p>
<p>The process in Fig. 27.1 could apply to mass marketing as well as data-
base marketing. However, database marketing campaigns differ from mass
marketing in their emphasis on field testing and personalization. Each of the
copy and media steps can be tested and personalized to individual customers.
Even the evaluation can be conducted using a test. We will see illustrations
of testing and personalization in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The personalization aspect of database marketing communications is part
of a broader theme: 1-to-1 marketing. That term was coined by Peppers and
Rogers (1993; 1997), who applied it to creating specific products for indi-
vidual customers. Hess et al. (2007) define 1-to-1 marketing more broadly, as
&ldquo;tailoring one or more elements of the marketing mix to each customer.&rdquo; Hess
et al. distinguish two types of 1-to-1 marketing: &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; and &ldquo;cus-
tomization.&rdquo; Personalization is when firms use customer data to individualize

<p>one or elements of the marketing mix &ndash; products, channels, prices, commu-
nications &ndash; for each customer. Customization is when the customer takes
the lead, typically in the product arena, designing the product he or she
most prefers. A prime example of customization is Dell&rsquo;s website that allows
the customer to specify the product. Examples of personalization include
the Amazon website&rsquo;s recommendations or Tesco&rsquo;s personalized promotion
system (Chapter 22). Throughout this book, we have emphasized personal-
ization, since it is based directly on customer databases. In this chapter, we
emphasize the personalized design of communications.1
</p>
<p>27.2 Setting the Overall Plan
</p>
<p>27.2.1 Objectives
</p>
<p>The overall plan consists of objectives, a strategy for achieving the objectives,
and a budget. Objectives usually include specific goals such as &lsquo;increase sales
by 10%,&rdquo; &ldquo;acquire 20,000 customers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;reduce churn by 5%.&rdquo; Campaign
objectives are usually action oriented, similar to sales promotion objectives
(Blattberg and Neslin 1990).
</p>
<p>It is useful to make &ldquo;qualitative&rdquo; as well as quantitative considerations part
of the objective. For example, the objective of a direct marketing campaign
for an electronics device manufacturer might be, &ldquo;Achieve a 1% response rate
while reinforcing product positioning on quality and reliability.&rdquo; The objec-
tives of an offer for an upscale retailer&rsquo;s customers to join a reward program
might be &ldquo;induce 20% of current customers to sign up for the reward cam-
paign by emphasizing our quality and service.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Qualitative goals are important for three reasons: First, database mar-
keting campaigns often play a dual role as promotions and advertising
</p>
<p>1 See Murthi and Sarkar (2003) for an excellent review of product personalization.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27.2 Setting the Overall Plan 717
</p>
<p>(e.g., Smith and Berger 1998). Promotions are most directly concerned with
changing behavior, while advertising is often concerned with changing atti-
tudes. Overly focusing on the promotion aspect of the communication can
preoccupy the customer with the &ldquo;deal&rdquo; rather than the merits of the prod-
uct.2 Second, since database marketing campaigns are amenable to evaluation
in terms of quantitative criteria such as sales, profits, ROI, etc., it is easy to
lose sight of overall marketing strategy. Third, while qualitative objectives
are difficult to evaluate, they guide the creative, offer, product, and copy
elements of the campaign.
</p>
<p>27.2.2 Strategy
</p>
<p>Following Nash (2000, p. 36), we consider communications strategy to encom-
pass: (1) Creative, (2) Offer, (3) Product, and (4) Media. Creative refers to
overall tone and approach of the communication, as well execution in terms of
artwork, type font, layout, etc. The offer refers to price, promotions, financial
terms, shipping charges, etc. The product refers to the specific product (or
service) contained in the offer, and how it is described (positioned). Media
refers to the choice of media and how they will be scheduled. These aspects
of the campaign can be stated in general terms when setting the overall plan,
but the details are worked out as the planning process progresses. We discuss
these details in subsequent sections of this chapter.
</p>
<p>27.2.3 Budget
</p>
<p>Budgets can be set in three ways: (1) based on last year&rsquo;s budget, (2) derived
from objectives and strategy, or (3) derived from an optimization. From a
purely scientific point of view, budgets should be derived from an optimiza-
tion. However, while optimization models provide a good starting point and
can help managers think &ldquo;out-of-the-box,&rdquo; they omit strategic and organiza-
tion issues that play an important role in determining the budget. Roberts
and Berger (1999) discuss the role of last year&rsquo;s budget in determining this
year&rsquo;s budget. If last year&rsquo;s results were acceptable, a small adjustment from
last year might be appropriate. Also, if the objectives are for marginal growth,
or emphasize ROI rather than absolute sales or profits, using last year&rsquo;s bud-
get as a benchmark might be useful.
</p>
<p>Deriving the budget from objectives and strategy involves a direct de-
termination of what it will cost to achieve the desired objectives using the

</p>
<p>prescribed strategy. For example, the plan might be to acquire 200,000 cus-
tomers using direct mail. We might assume that the cost of acquiring these
200,000 additional customers via direct mail will be $20 per acquisition. This
implies a $4,000,000 budget. Note we use the marginal, not average cost per
acquisition (Chapter 26). The distinction is important. While last year the
firm might have averaged $20 per acquisition, it may cost much more than
that to acquire 200,000 additional customers this year. While deriving budget
from objectives is attractive, one must be very careful to distinguish marginal
from average costs.
</p>
<p>In summary, optimization, last year&rsquo;s budget, or a calculation of what is
required to meet objectives, all have their plusses and minuses as budgeting
techniques. It is advisable to use at least two of the three techniques and
check consistency.
</p>
<p>27.2.4 Summary
</p>
<p>The first step in developing a communications program is to develop ob-
jectives, strategy, and a budget. Objectives are almost always quantita-
tive in a database marketing context although can contain qualitative con-
siderations as well, even if they are difficult to measure. Strategy con-
sists of creative, offer, product, and media plans. Budget may be derived
from last year&rsquo;s budget, from the objectives and strategy, or from an op-
timization. Consider an acquisition campaign for a consumer electronics
company:
</p>
<p>Objectives:
</p>
<p>Acquire 200,000 customers while not compromising on price.
</p>
<p>Strategy:
</p>
<p>Creative: Emphasize informational approach, professional tone.
Offer: Maintain standard price; perhaps offer free delivery or easy payment
</p>
<p>terms.
Product: Include three products from our product line in the offer, per-
</p>
<p>sonalized for each customer using predictive model derived from tests.
Media: Direct mail
</p>
<p>Budget:
</p>
<p>Direct mail historically acquires customers at a cost of $20 per customer,
so the budget is 200,000 &times; $20 = $4, 000, 000. However, money is
very tight this year and our hope is through personalization we can
lower that cost. Cost savings will go toward R&amp;D for various product
lines.</p>

<p>27.3.1 Creative Strategy
</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, the creative strategy represents the overall tone or ap-
proach to the communications piece, as well as the particular executions in
terms of artwork, layout, etc. Various creative approaches include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Informational : Emphasizes the provision of information. This might be
appropriate for a B2B product or a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; product such as a pharma-
ceutical.
</p>
<p>&bull; Humorous: Humor might be appropriate for a gift-oriented catalog.
&bull; Testimonial : Emphasizes testimonials by satisfied customers. This would
</p>
<p>be appropriate for a high-risk product such as consumer electronics.
&bull; Deal-oriented : Emphasizes price and getting a good deal. This might be
</p>
<p>appropriate when the target group is price sensitive or for a sale catalog.
&bull; Authoritarian: Relies on an authoritarian figure such as an expert. For
</p>
<p>example, a campaign designed to enhance drug compliance might use a
physician as a spokesperson.
</p>
<p>&bull; Glossy : Emphasizes an expensive look. This would be appropriate for a
high-end cataloger.
</p>
<p>&bull; Personal : Oriented toward the individual&rsquo;s needs. This would be appro-
priate for a cross-sell appeal.
</p>
<p>&bull; Comparative: Compares the company&rsquo;s product to a competitor&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>There are several other possibilities. Nash (2000, chapter 9, p. 217) thinks
of the creative strategy as consisting of three major elements: the product
(what does it deliver), the customer (how does it make the customer feel emo-
tionally), and company credibility (does the company have the credibility to
deliver what it claims). Nash suggests that a relatively small company selling
risky products might &ldquo;allocate&rdquo; most of its creative effort toward establish-
ing product credibility. This might be accomplished through a testimonial,
authoritarian, or comparative approach.
</p>
<p>Lewis (1999) distinguishes among &ldquo;romantic,&rdquo; &ldquo;sedate,&rdquo; and &ldquo;flat&rdquo; ap-
proaches to devising copy for direct marketing pieces. Romantic approaches
emphasize an idealistic, dreamy tone. An example for cookware would be
(Lewis 1999, p. 57):
</p>
<p>C&rsquo;est Merveilleuse! Bourgeat Copper Cookware from France! One of the world&rsquo;s greatest
chefs cooks with the world&rsquo;s best copperware. Now you can too. . . . This master chef&rsquo;s solid
copper gourmet cookware ensemble cooks as beautifully as it looks.
</p>
<p>A sedate approach emphasizes the benefits of the product but in an informa-
tive, expository style. For example (Lewis 1999, p. 57):
</p>
<p>All-Clad Copper Cookware. No other material spreads heat faster or more evenly than cop-
per, which is why you&rsquo;ll find a gleaming battery of copper pots in every famous restaurant.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>720 27 Designing Database Marketing Communications
</p>
<p>All-Clad lines their copper cookware in stainless steel, making them easy to clean, imper-
vious to scratches, and non-reactive with food.
</p>
<p>A flat approach lays out the bare facts. Following is an example (Lewis 1999,
p. 58):
</p>
<p>Five-piece place setting in 18/10 stainless steel with pearlized resin handles. Choose lime,
yellow, blue, or clear. Silver-plated connectors. Imported.
</p>
<p>The flat approach emphasizes just the facts. It might be appropriate for a
business-to-business communication or in any case where the customer is an
expert and just needs to know the facts to make a purchase decision.
</p>
<p>Fiore and Yu (2001) compare &ldquo;imagery&rdquo; and &ldquo;descriptive&rdquo; approaches
(analogous to romantic versus sedate) in designing a clothing catalog. They
conduct an experiment in which one catalog used just descriptive ads (com-
municating the benefits of the product but in a factual way) while another
included both the descriptive and imagery approaches (also adding a roman-
tic story about wearing the clothing on an adventurous vacation, etc.). The
authors found there was no difference in respondent attitudes or intentions
to buy between the two catalogs. This may be due to (1) heterogeneity in the
target group, i.e., some resonate with the romantic approach while some are
turned off, or (2) the combination of descriptive and imagery diluted their
individual contributions.
</p>
<p>Creative approaches should harmonize with the positioning of the product.
An upscale cataloger should use a glossy approach. A price-oriented catalog
should adopt a deal-oriented approach. A cross-sell by a local bank might uti-
lize the personal approach (e.g., &ldquo;As part of our continued efforts to attend
to your personal banking needs, we thought you might be interested in our
IRA transfer service&rdquo;). Casual experience suggests this may not always be
the case. Credit card solicitations often are deal-oriented (&ldquo;Get 5% APR and
bonus miles when you sign up for the ABC credit card&rdquo;) rather than infor-
mational (&ldquo;The ABC credit card is accepted nearly everywhere and rewards
you with airline miles for every dollar spent &ndash; as a special introductory offer,
you get a 5% APR and bonus miles when you sign up&rdquo;). See Schlosser et al.
(1999) for a discussion of Internet shopper preferences for various creative
approaches.
</p>
<p>Comparative advertising has received much attention in the advertis-
ing literature. Database marketing provides a particularly attractive venue
for comparative advertising, because appropriate comparisons can be tar-
geted to the right customers. The general benefits of comparative adver-
tising are increased attention and more effective communication of infor-
mation, while its pitfalls include competitive response, customer confu-
sion, and even customer sympathy for the &ldquo;attacked&rdquo; brand (Assael 1995,
pp. 439&ndash;441; 726&ndash;728). While the evidence is somewhat mixed, it appears
that comparative advertising can produce higher sales when the source of
the information is credible, or when the target product is new or lower share
(Assael 1995, pp. 439&ndash;441; 726&ndash;728; Engel et al. 1995, pp. 569&ndash;570).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27.3 Developing Copy 721
</p>
<p>Smith and Burger (1998) investigated comparative advertising in the con-
text of a direct mail offer for a new video camera. The authors found using a
laboratory experiment that the effectiveness of comparative advertising de-
pended on what was being compared (price, product attributes, or product
experiences) and the target customer (highly knowledgeable about the cat-
egory, medium knowledge, or low knowledge). The results also depended on
whether the dependent variable was purchase intentions for a single product
or choice between two side-by-side products. In terms of purchase intentions
(most relevant for direct marketers), price comparisons increased purchase in-
tentions for low and high knowledge customers. Attribute comparisons were
effective for low knowledge customers, while experience comparisons were ef-
fective for high knowledge customers. When choosing between products (as in
retail shopping), experience comparisons were effective for low-knowledge
customers.
</p>
<p>This study highlights that comparative advertising may be an appropriate
creative approach for database marketing provided the appropriate compar-
isons can be targeted based on product knowledge. Database marketers may
therefore find it advantageous to test various comparative advertising execu-
tions. However, the potential pitfalls of comparative advertising (sympathy
and hence sales for the competitive brand, and competitive retaliation) are
difficult to measure in a test. More research is needed to gauge these effects
in a database marketing context.
</p>
<p>While the above discussion pertains to the overall creative appeal, there are
several execution details that need to be worked out. These include everything
from the type font to specific colors to the wording of sentences (length, use
of active verbs, etc.) to the placement of larger pictures on the bottom versus
the top of a catalog page. Usually these decisions on the basis of judgment;
sometimes specific elements might be tested if deemed important enough.
</p>
<p>Gatarski (2002) presents a method for developing over time the optimal
creative for an Internet banner ad. A crucial measure of success for an on-
line ad is its click-through rate (CTR). CTR is defined as the number of
click-throughs divided by the number of exposures. Gatarski describes the
use of a genetic algorithm to design online advertising copy as factorial com-
binations of ad attributes. The genetic algorithm systematically weeds out
under-performing ads over time when it creates a new &ldquo;generation&rdquo; of ads. A
given ad may generate a high CTR and therefore replicate itself in succeeding
generations. However, as its CTR decreases perhaps due to wear out, it is
less likely to replicate itself and it dies out, replaced by another ad whose
CTR is higher.
</p>
<p>Gatarski applied the method to a Compact Disk retail website. The author
selected a particular artist and tested the ability of the algorithm to create
banner ads that would maximize CTR for the artist&rsquo;s CD. Ads were created
as factorial combinations of ad attributes called &ldquo;genes.&rdquo; Each gene consisted
of a number of levels (as in a conjoint analysis) called &ldquo;alleles.&rdquo; For example,
one gene (attribute) was the artist&rsquo;s picture, of which there were four alleles</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>722 27 Designing Database Marketing Communications
</p>
<p>(versions). Other genes included the product picture and use of action phrases
such as &ldquo;Click to Play.&rdquo; A collection of genes with their specific alleles would
constitute a particular ad, called a &ldquo;chromosome.&rdquo; The algorithm to create
and evolve chromosomes was as follows:
</p>
<p>1. Start with 20 randomly generated banners. This is the first &ldquo;generation&rdquo;
of chromosomes.
</p>
<p>2. Place those banners on the website (the algorithm does not optimize the
placement of ads, just the ad copy).
</p>
<p>3. Observe response (click-throughs) to the banners.
4. After a period of time, generate the next generation of banners:
</p>
<p>a. Calculate click-through rate for each banner (chromosome).
b. Calculate the &ldquo;Fitness&rdquo; for each chromosome, proportional to its CTR.
</p>
<p>Fitness represents the probability each chromosome will be selected as
&ldquo;parents&rdquo; for the next generation.
</p>
<p>c. Select two chromosomes randomly but proportional to fitness.
d. Randomly select the &ldquo;cross-over point&rdquo; gene.
e. Generate a new child that has the genes of one parent from the left side
</p>
<p>of the cross-over point, and of the other parent to the right side of the
cross-over. (The genes for each chromosome are displayed in a sequence,
so one can think of the left or right side of the cross-over gene.)
</p>
<p>f. &ldquo;Mutate&rdquo; the child by randomly changing a few of its genes.
g. Return the parents to the &ldquo;pool&rdquo; of prospective parents.
h. Repeat steps c&ndash;g 19 more times, generating a total of 20 children, the
</p>
<p>next generation of banner ads.
i. Repeat steps 2&ndash;4 for as many generations as desirable.
</p>
<p>The algorithm ensures that the more successful a banner is at generating
click-throughs, the more likely it is to be selected as a parent for the next
generation of banners. Twenty children are created each generation, and each
is generated by two randomly selected parents. As a parent, the banner gets
to pass on its genes (a randomly generated amount depending on the cross-
over point). The mutation step represents the key step in evolution whereby
potentially valuable new banner characteristics become part of the banner
population. If these mutations are not effective, the chromosome is less likely
to be selected as a parent and the mutation dies out. In general, the chromo-
somes with valuable genes replicate and their genes are perpetuated as long
as they are effective.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the genes that flourished. Use of a click-through
sign became more and more prevalent over time. A close-up of the artist&rsquo;s face
also became prevalent, as did &ldquo;Click to Play.&rdquo; Figure 27.2 shows the average
click-through rate achieved for the successive generations. The average CTR
starts at about 1% and grows to 1.66% by the 16th generation. There are
some &ldquo;lapses,&rdquo; possibly caused by mutations that didn&rsquo;t work or by wear out.
The average CTR for the standard banner used by the company was 0.68%
over the course of the experiment, and the CTR for the first generation of</p>

<p>banners when they are not allowed to change over time averaged 1.00%. The
genetically engineered banners outperform both these benchmarks.
</p>
<p>This example presents promising evidence that the creative details of ad-
vertising copy can be optimally generated and adjusted over time. The adjust-
ment is driven by customer data in the form of click-through rate. Ads would
have to be quantifiable as factorial combinations of attributes, which may
not always be possible. However, Gatarski&rsquo;s work suggests the practicality of
the approach for banner advertising.
</p>
<p>27.3.2 The Offer
</p>
<p>Price is often a critical component of a database marketing offer. Research
has investigated how to communicate price in a catalog or direct mail offer,
particularly the use of end-nine prices and Sales signs.
</p>
<p>Simester and Anderson (2003) investigate the use of end-nine prices by
conducting a field experiment with three catalogs. The control catalog con-
tained 50 items whose price ended in a nine. In the two treatment catalogs,
prices of these items were either increased or decreased by $1. The three cat-
alogs were each mailed to 20,000 customers. The authors found that after
controlling for the popularity of specific items, price per se had insignificant
impact on sales within the plus-or-minus $2 range in which it was manip-
ulated. However, an end-nine price generated on average 35% higher sales.
That is, if an item was presented at $58, $59, or $60, the $59 version would
generate 35% higher sales than either the $60 or $58 version! They conducted
a second test where prices were varied in a broader range, and the incremental</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>724 27 Designing Database Marketing Communications
</p>
<p>sales due to end-nine was about 15%. In addition, the authors found that the
end-nine effect was particularly pronounced for new items.
</p>
<p>In another test, the authors manipulated the use of a &ldquo;Sale&rdquo; cue along
with the price. They found that the use of the Sale cue decreased the end-
nine effect. For example, an end-nine price would increase sales of a new item
by 8.5%, but if a &ldquo;Sale&rdquo; message is already included, the incremental gain is
only 3.9%.
</p>
<p>The authors posit two explanations for the end-nine effect. The drop-
off explanation is that customers round down, process left to right, or just
process the left-most digit because of the cognitive cost of processing all
digits. If they round down, then $59 is the same as $50. Similarly, if they
process left to right, $55 will look different from $45 but the same as $59.
The information explanation is that customers use an end-nine as a cue that
the item is specially priced or on sale. They may have been conditioned by
previous promotional pricing that used end-nine prices.
</p>
<p>In a post hoc analysis, Simester and Anderson find support for the infor-
mation explanation and not the drop-off explanation. They use a regression
analysis of sales to show that the tens and ones digits of a price are equally
important. That is, on a per dollar basis, a change in the tens digit of the price
is equally important as a change in the ones digit. Moreover, the end-nine
and Sale effects remain significant in this analysis.
</p>
<p>If indeed the end-nine effect is due to the information it conveys, one
would naturally be concerned about over-using end-nines. If the customer
reacts positively to end-nines because he/she infers the product is specially
priced or on sale, one cannot use all end-nine prices because it is doubtful
that all items could be on sale.
</p>
<p>The authors follow this line of reasoning in their investigation of the use of
Sale signs in catalogs (Anderson and Simester 2001). They find in a regression
analysis that the impact of a Sale sign on sales of a particular catalog item
is smaller if more items on the page have Sale signs. Similarly, in a field
experiment, they create a control and a treatment catalog. In the control
catalog, three items on four pages are depicted as on sale and the remaining
five items are not depicted as on sale. In the test catalog, all eight items are
depicted as on sale. The results showed that sales decreased for the three
items on sale in both catalogs when the other five items are put on sale.
</p>
<p>There are three possible explanations for the results: substitution, atten-
tion, and credibility. Substitution means that Sale signs become less effective
because items on sale cannibalize each other. Attention says that consumers
pay less attention to the Sale sign when more brands have them. Credibility
says that consumers do pay attention, but don&rsquo;t believe the Sale sign because
it is not plausible that so many items could have a reduced price at the same
time.
</p>
<p>The authors discriminate between substitution and credibility/attention
effects by noting the impact of Sales signs on total category demand. The
substitution argument would predict category demand to be constant no</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27.3 Developing Copy 725
</p>
<p>matter how many Sale signs the catalog has. However, the credibility and
attention arguments would suggest that category sales will increase up to
a certain point and then decrease when there are too many Sale signs that
are either ignored or not believed. In a study of packaged goods, the authors
indeed find an inverted-U relationship between the number of Sale signs and
category sales, supporting the credibility/attention arguments.
</p>
<p>To discriminate between attention and credibility explanations, the au-
thors run a laboratory experiment in which they vary the number of items
on a catalog page that contain Sale signs. They find that when an item is on
sale and additional products are also on sale, subjects think it more likely
that the item will be on sale next period and that the average future price
will be lower. This implies they pay attention to the Sale sign in that it
influences their perception of future prices. However, they don&rsquo;t believe the
current price is &ldquo;special&rdquo; in that the item is more likely to be on &ldquo;sale&rdquo; next
period. That is, Sale signs lose their credibility as signaling a special price
the more they are used.
</p>
<p>The authors conclude that the credibility effect is the best explanation
for Sale signs becoming less effective the more items use them. One avenue
for future research is to investigate the substitution effect in a catalog en-
vironment rather than packaged goods. Packaged goods are purchased in a
supermarket, and category effects may dominate since most of these products
can be stored in household inventory (see Van Heerde et al. 2004). In buying
from a catalog, shoppers may focus on which computer to buy, or which dress
to buy, so substitution would dominate.
</p>
<p>In summary, a key tactical issue in copy design for database marketing is
how to communicate price. The evidence is that (1) end-nine prices increase
sales, (2) the end-nine effect is particularly strong for new items, (3) Sale
signs decrease the impact of end-nine prices, (4) Sale signs increase sales of
particular items until too many items have Sale signs, at which point its
effectiveness per item actually decreases. The reason for the end-nine effect
appears to be the information conveyed that the item is at a special price.
The reason for the Sale-sign-saturation effect seems to be a loss in credibility.
While no research has investigated the loss of credibility for end-nine prices,
this is an obvious avenue for future study. The above conclusions are based
on two excellent, carefully researched studies, but only two. The results need
replication and extension.
</p>
<p>The implication is that database marketers should use end-nine and Sale
signs albeit judiciously, in designing their offer. In the case of a catalog, the
database marketer can make sure he or she does not overuse end-nine prices
or Sale signs. However, in designing a single offer, the decision is either/or,
not how many. The individual database marketer may feel he or she is not
overusing this tactic, but if all database marketers behave the same way, the
result is a collective saturation of the impact &ndash; customers grow weary of so
many end-nine prices and Sale signs. It would be valuable to see this issue
explored further.</p>

</p>
<p>27.3.3 The Product
</p>
<p>27.3.3.1 Deciding Which Products to Feature in Communications
</p>
<p>Often the product to be included in the communication is known beforehand.
For example, a B2B electric generator company knows the set of products it
will include in its catalog. There may still be issues such as which product(s)
to promote. Lin and Hong (2008) use market basket analysis (Chapter 13)
to select various bundles of products to promote in an electronic catalog.
They utilize the &ldquo;support&rdquo; (P(AB), see Chapter 13) for various combinations
of products to create the bundles and provide evidence that this method
increased catalog sales.
</p>
<p>Database marketing provides the capability to personalize the firm&rsquo;s prod-
uct to be offered. For example, a fundamental tenet for Capital One&rsquo;s credit
card business is that the particular credit card to be included in a direct mail
offer is determined by test mailings. Financial services routinely decide which
products to cross-sell to which customers (Knott et al. 2002).
</p>
<p>Ansari and Mela (2003) develop a model and optimization for deciding
which URL links to include in customer-specific e-mails. The setting is a
news/information website that sends e-mails to its users to entice them to
the site. The company wishes to gain &ldquo;readership,&rdquo; thereby increasing its
advertising revenues. The website has 12 content areas (products) and it
must decide which k content areas to feature in the e-mail (k &le; 12) and in
which order. The content areas are featured by providing a URL link to the
page in the company&rsquo;s website that includes this content. The authors collect
data on response to previous e-mails, and estimate the following model:
</p>
<p>Uijk = X &prime;ijk&micro;+ Z
&prime;
jkλi +W
</p>
<p>&prime;
ikθj + γk + eijk (27.1)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Uijk = Utility of customer i for content link k in e-mail j.
X &prime;ijk = Vector of attributes describing e-mail j with content link k seen by
</p>
<p>customer i. These include for example the content area, the position of
the content link (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc., on the list), the number of content
area links featured on the e-mail, whether the e-mail was text or HTML,
the length of time since customer i last clicked through an e-mail, etc.
These represent &ldquo;fixed effects&rdquo; in that &micro; is the average response to these
variables.
</p>
<p>Z &prime;jk = A subset of the X variables that vary across content areas or e-
mails, for which response is assumed to be heterogeneous across customers.
Customer response to content link, number of content areas in the e-mail,
and position was assumed heterogeneous, captured by λi.
</p>
<p>W &prime;ik = A subset of the X variables that vary across customer or content-
area levels, whose effect could be heterogeneous across e-mails. This could
include position as well as dummy variables for the content area. For</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27.3 Developing Copy 727
</p>
<p>example, it might be that two e-mails featuring the same content area
might differ in the response they elicit (due to unobserved factors such as
season, etc.). The degree that the effects of these variables varies across
e-mails is reflected in θj .
</p>
<p>γk = Unobserved factors specific to content area k.
eijk = Unobserved factors specific to customer i, e-mail j, content area k.
</p>
<p>The authors estimate Equation 27.1 using Bayesian techniques and ex-
periment with various ways to capture heterogeneity. Some of their key
results are: (1) Few content areas are universally preferred by all customers.
(2) There is ample heterogeneity in content preferences across customers. (3)
The lower the position of a content area in an e-mail, the less likely it is to
be clicked through. (4) The number of content areas featured in an e-mail
had no effect on average across customers, but there was some heterogeneity
across customers.
</p>
<p>The estimation generated individual-level response coefficients to con-
tent areas featured, position of a particular content area in the e-mail, and
number of content areas featured in the e-mail. The authors then develop an
optimization model to design each customer&rsquo;s e-mail. They considered two
objectives &ndash; maximizing the expected number of clicks per e-mail, or maxi-
mizing the likelihood of at least one click through. We show the formulation
for the latter objective, because it is unlikely the customer would come back
to the e-mail after clicking through one of the content area URL&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>To make the optimization easier, the authors undertake a two-phase ap-
proach where for a fixed number of items in the e-mail (k), they find the best
content areas to include in which position. They vary k from 1 to 12 (since
there are 12 content areas, k &le; 12 &equiv; n). For a given customer and a given
number of items, the optimization is:

<p>the most preferred was placed on top or bottom depended on the sign of the
position variable (a positive sign implies the customer has higher utility if
the content link is toward the bottom of the set of links, i.e., the customer is
a bottom-up processor, while a negative sign implies the customer is a top-
down processor), and (3) a greedy algorithm that kept the number of content
areas the same, i.e., k, but included the k highest-preferred content areas for
each customer and inserted them in the e-mail in order of preference. The
results are shown in Fig. 27.3.
</p>
<p>All three algorithms improve significantly over the baseline click-through
rate: the rate in the holdout data using the e-mails as they were originally
designed. The strong performance of the ordering and greedy algorithms,
which took the number of links in the e-mail as given, is probably due to
the fact that the number-of-items variable turned out not to be crucial &ndash; its
coefficient on average was not different than zero, and although there was
customer heterogeneity on this coefficient, it was not enough to make a big
difference. However, the success of the ordering and greedy algorithms shows
that the customer-level content preference and top-down versus bottom-up
processing measures (reflected by the position variable) were important.
</p>
<p>Ansari and Mela&rsquo;s work is very important because it shows how to person-
alize a communication to include the products most relevant to a customer.
The model could be extended to include creative and offer variables as well
(in fact, the authors included one creative detail &ndash; text versus html &ndash; in their
model). Two avenues for future research building on this work would ap-
ply it to multi-campaign scheduling &ndash; i.e., scheduling several e-mails over</p>

full house list. One approach would be to use latent class segmentation
and calculate posterior probabilities of segment membership using Bayes
theorem.

<p>27.3.3.2 Allocating Catalog Space to Various Departments
</p>
<p>Single Catalog
</p>
<p>Squeezed by mailing costs that limit the size of catalogs coupled with ex-
panded product lines, allocating catalog space to departments or product
lines has become a challenging issue for catalogers. The problem is somewhat
similar to the space allocation problem in bricks-and-mortar retail stores.
However, as Desmet (1993) points out, the space decision is fixed for the du-
ration of a catalog whereas it is flexible in a store. In addition, catalog space
allocations draw the customer into the catalog, whereas shelf space alloca-
tions in stores influence the customer who has already decided on a shopping
trip. Of additional interest to database marketers is that catalogs can be tai-
lored to individual customers, which cannot happen in a bricks-and-mortar
store.
</p>
<p>While from a database marketing perspective, personalization is the ulti-
mate goal, it is useful to examine first the situation of a single mass-marketed
catalog. Rao and Simon (1983) pioneered this case. They derive the simple
rule that under certain assumptions, the optimal allocation of space is such
that the profit per square inch of allocated space is equal for all departments.
Their decision problem is as follows:
</p>
<p>Max
xi
</p>
<p>Z =
&sum;
i
</p>
<p>miSi(xi)&minus;
&sum;
i
</p>
<p>Ci(xi) (27.3)
</p>
<p>subject to :
&sum;
i
</p>
<p>xi = P (27.4)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>mi = Profit margin for category i.
Si = Sales of department i.
xi = Space allocated to department i.
Ci = Cost function for department i.
P = Total page limit for catalog.
</p>
<p>This can be solved using Lagrange multipliers. The most important impli-
cation is that the space allocation should be such that the marginal profit
contributions for all departments is the same. If at a given allocation, the
marginal contribution of one department is higher than the others, we would
add more space to that department and reduce space for the others. That is,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>730 27 Designing Database Marketing Communications
</p>
<p>we are not at an &ldquo;equilibrium&rdquo; allocation until all the marginal contributions
are equal.
</p>
<p>Rao and Simon (1983) show that if sales response is a simple power func-
tion, Si = αix
</p>
<p>βi
i with all βi&rsquo;s less than 1,
</p>
<p>3 and if the βi&rsquo;s are equal for all
departments, then the optimal allocation is:
</p>
<p>x&lowast;i =
PmiSi&sum;
j
</p>
<p>mjSj
(27.5)
</p>
<p>or,
</p>
<p>miSi
x&lowast;i
</p>
<p>=
</p>
<p>&sum;
j
</p>
<p>mjSj
</p>
<p>P
(27.6)
</p>
<p>Equation 27.6 says that at the optimal allocation, all departments will gen-
erate the same profit per square inch (or other unit of area) of allocated
space. This is a very usable rule of thumb since profit per square inch is
easily calculated. If the space response elasticities are not all equal, Equa-
tions 27.5 and 27.6 are modified so that βimi replaces mi, and βjmj replaces
mj . Equation 27.6 then becomes:
</p>
<p>miSi
x&lowast;i
</p>
<p>=
</p>
<p>&sum;
j
</p>
<p>βjmjSj
</p>
<p>βiP
(27.7)
</p>
<p>Equation 27.7 implies that profit per square inch for a given department is
inversely proportional to its elasticity. The reason for this is that as elasticity
increases, we tend to allocate more space to the department, but the increase
in profits has diminishing returns (since βi &lt; 1). As a result, the profit per
square inch decreases with higher elasticity.
</p>
<p>An important assumption is the absence of cross-department effects.4
</p>
<p>There could be complementarity or substitution effects, which would make
the allocation more complicated. The objective would still be the same as
Equation 27.3, except there would probably not be a closed-form solution.
Corstjens and Doyle (1981) or Bultez and Naert (1988) solve similar prob-
lems in a retail store environment.
</p>
<p>A critical empirical question for the above analysis is, what is the space
response elasticity (β)? Equation 27.6 for example is predicated on the as-
sumption that elasticities are all less than one and equal to each other across
departments. Equation 27.7 abandons the equality assumption but still as-
sumes concave returns.
</p>
<p>3 This assumption means diminishing returns to space allocation, or concave returns. If
space elasticities are &gt;1, the optimal allocation is to devote all possible space to the
highest elasticity department.

context of Internet Web page design.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27.3 Developing Copy 731
</p>
<p>The evidence is limited in scope but it appears to be that elasticities are
less than one. Desmet (1995) found that space elasticities for a book cata-
log were 0.43 for new books and 0.43 for old books. Sokolick and Hartung
(1969) found an elasticity of 0.56. Desmet (1993) found an elasticity of 1.18
for clothing, although suspects that this is over-stated. Desmet (1993) finds
managerial judgments of elasticities range from 0.55 to 0.77. This work is sug-
gestive, but much more work is needed to measure own and cross-department
elasticities. To obtain these estimates, managers must be willing to vary space
allocation systematically in a field test. See Seaver and Simpson (1995) for
an experiment to study catalog design.
</p>
<p>Personalized Catalogs
</p>
<p>Of keen interest to the database marketer is how to personalize catalog space
for individual customers. We present an illustration of how this might be
done. We assume there are J market segments, each with a different response
function. The goal is to design a catalog tailored to each segment by allocating
the number of pages from each of D departments to each of the J catalogs.
Note the number of catalogs equal the number of customer segments, so J
is both the total number of segments and the total number of catalogs to be
specified. The problem can be expressed as:
</p>
<p>max
⇀
x j
</p>
<p>&sum;

</p>
<p>mδjSj(

</p>
<p>xij &ge; 0 &forall;i, j (27.8d)
xij integer &forall;i, j (27.8e)
</p>
<p>where:
⇀
x j = {xij} = (x1j , x2j , . . . , xDj), where xij is the number of pages for de-
</p>
<p>partment i allocated to catalog j. D is the number of departments.
Sj = Sales per customer in catalog j as a function of the allocation
</p>
<p>⇀
x j .
</p>
<p>The sales response function differs for each catalog because each catalog
represents a different market segment.
</p>
<p>δj = Percentage of customer base represented by segment j(
&sum;
</p>
<p>j δj = 1).
m = Profit margin, assumed to be equal across departments.
P = Number of pages to be allocated to each catalog.</p>

<p>Constraint 27.8a ensures that each catalog has P pages. Constraints 27.8b
and 27.8c are departmental exposure requirements that arise because the firm
wants to make sure that each department gets at least minimum exposure,
but is not over-emphasized. This reflects long-term considerations in the po-
sitioning of the catalog and inventory management. Constraint 27.8b ensures
that each catalog contains at least a minimum number of pages from each
department, and no more than a maximum. Constraint 27.8c ensures that
each department has minimum and maximum representation across all cata-
logs. Constraints 27.8d and 27.8e require that page allocations take on integer
values greater than zero. Therefore, this is an integer programming problem.
</p>
<p>Note this is a joint optimization does not maximize profits from each seg-
ment separately. Therefore, there is the possibility that one of the generated
catalogs, say j&prime;, generates more profit in segment j than the catalog gen-
erated for segment j! This is because the catalogs are being generated to
satisfy departmental representation constraints (27.8b and 27.8c) so segment
j&rsquo;s catalog may contain a large number of pages from department i, not be-
cause this maximizes sales from segment j but because segment j has the
best response to department i and we need a minimum representation of
department i among the J catalogs.
</p>
<p>Table 27.1 summarizes the parameters for an illustrative analysis of the
model. We have three segments so there will be three catalogs (J = 3).
There are three departments (D = 3). Each catalog consists of 50 pages,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27.3 Developing Copy 733
</p>
<p>and must contain between 10 and 40 pages of each department (given the
50-page total, the effective upper bound is 30 for each department). Across
all catalogs, we must have between 30 and 120 pages for each department.
The space response function is:
</p>
<p>Sj = αj
D&prod;
i=1
</p>
<p>x
βij
ij (27.9)
</p>
<p>This is a multiplicative response function with constant elasticities shown in
Table 27.1. The elasticities and segment percentages show that Segment 2 is
the largest segment and is particularly responsive to Department C space.
Segment 3 is the smallest and likes Departments B and C. Segment 1 is
mid-sized and likes Departments A and B.
</p>
<p>The bottom of Table 27.1 shows the optimal allocation of pages. The al-
locations are intuitive. Segments generally are allocated pages proportional
to their elasticities. For example, Segment 3 gets pages mostly from Depart-
ments B and C and has the minimal amount required for Department A.
Segment 2 receives 2 more pages than the minimum for Department A even
though its elasticity is the same as Segment 3&rsquo;s. This is because Segment 2
has a very low elasticity for Department B. None of the across-catalog de-
partmental representation constraints is binding, although the within-catalog
requirements sometimes are binding on the low side. Clearly it isn&rsquo;t optimal
for Segment 2 taken in isolation to receive 10 pages of Department B, since
its elasticity is only 0.1. However, long-term considerations dictate the min-
imum requirement. Finally, note that Segment 3, although it is smallest in
terms of percentage of customers, has a high constant term so contributes
the most to overall profit.
</p>
<p>Figure 27.4 shows how the optimal solution changes as elasticity increases.
In particular, we vary Segment 2&rsquo;s elasticity for Department B. The results
are predictable. As elasticity increases, the pages allocated to Department
B for Segment 2 increases. Since we have a 50-page limit, something has to
give. The optimal solution takes away pages from both departments. After
the allocation to Department A hits its lower bound, more pages are taken
from Department C. Profits increase exponentially after elasticity becomes
greater than 1, because then we have a convex demand function. While not
shown in Fig. 27.4, the allocations to the other segments remain about the
same.
</p>
<p>Figure 27.5 shows how the optimal solution changes as a lower bound con-
straint increases. In particular, we vary the across-catalog minimum for De-
partment B. This minimum is currently at 30 while the current solution
allocates 51 pages. So the constraint is non-binding and the optimal solution
does not change until the constraint moves above 50 pages. At 60 pages,
the model has to allocate an additional 9 pages, and allocates them to Seg-
ment 1&rsquo;s catalog. As the constraint increases, it allocates next to Segment 2&rsquo;s</p>

</p>
<p>catalog, and finally to Segment 3&rsquo;s.5 The reason for this order of allocation
is that Segment 1 has a fairly high elasticity for Department B, so we can
take away pages from the other departments in Segment 1&rsquo;s catalog without
too much sacrifice. Next the model allocates additional pages to Segment 2&rsquo;s
catalog although this is a low elasticity department for this segment. The
reason is that although we will have to take away from Department C, which
is popular with this segment, the segment does not influence total profits as
much. Finally, the model allocates more Department B pages to Segment 3&rsquo;s
catalog. This severely diminishes profit because Segment 3 represents the ma-
jority of firm profits and we are using a sub-optimal catalog for that segment
in order to fulfill the lower bound requirement.
</p>
<p>5 As noted above, while the explicit upper bound is 40 pages per catalog per department,
the effective constraint is 30 because the other departments have to have at least 10 pages
and the total catalog has 50 pages.</p>

<p>Fig. 27.5 Optimal allocation and profits as function of lower bound page requirement.
(a) Page allocation as a function of Department B lower bound; (b) Profit per customer
as function of Department B lower bound.
</p>
<p>The example illustrates that pages are allocated roughly proportional to
elasticities, but minimum and maximum requirements create distortions that
reverberate across as well as within segments. One might therefore question
why we have these constraints. The reason is that catalogers wish to main-
tain a presence in several departments, they may have plans to grow various
departments in the future, and they need to make up for the fixed costs of
running a particular department.
</p>
<p>While the above demonstrates that the optimization in Equation 27.8 is
quite rich, it does not contain explicit cross elasticities between departments.
The demand function is for the catalog as a whole, not individual depart-
ments. Extensions of this model would include departmental level demand
functions with cross-elasticities.
</p>
<p>Another extension would be to apply the model to the customer level,
where segments now correspond to individual customers. With 1,000,000
customers (N = 1,000,000), we could have 1,000,000 different catalogs. This
would be Equation 27.8 with J = 1,000,000. Another possibility would be</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>736 27 Designing Database Marketing Communications
</p>
<p>to specify J &lt; N: We might have 1,000,000 customers with 1,000,000 differ-
ent response functions, but only have say 10 catalogs (J = 10). This would
be a more difficult problem because the objective function would have to
distinguish between catalogs and customers. It would be:
</p>
<p>max
⇀
x j ,Mcj
</p>
<p>&sum;
c
</p>
<p>&sum;
j
</p>
<p>mScj(

</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Scj(
⇀
x j) = Sales for customer c if mailed catalog j and catalog j has page
</p>
<p>allocation
⇀
x j .
</p>
<p>Mcj = 1 if catalog j is mailed to customer c; 0 if not. We require of course
that only one catalog can be mailed to each customer, and all customers
must receive a catalog.
</p>
<p>This would be a more complicated optimization because we have two deci-
sion variables, the page allocation to creating each catalog, and the decision
of what catalog to mail to each customer. In the problem analyzed in this
section, catalogs corresponded to segments, which made the allocation and
mailing decision the same.
</p>
<p>27.3.4 Personalizing Multiple Components
of the Communication
</p>
<p>Ansari and Mela (2003) focused on personalizing the product(s) featured to
the customer, but their model also contained creative elements (their &ldquo;Text&rdquo;
variable). It also could have included aspects of the offer such as price (see
Rossi et al. (1996) for a price-personalization model, and Chapter 29). There-
fore, if a customer response model contains variables representing creative,
product, and offer components, it can be used to personalize communications
in terms of all these elements.
</p>
<p>Customer-level response models are attractive for personalizing communi-
cations. However, they rely on a fair amount of data per customer and the
optimization can become complex when tailoring more components. Another
approach is to use machine learning tools to personalize communications.
One domain where there has been initial work on this is in personalizing
websites.
</p>
<p>Ardissono and Goy (2000; see also Ardissono et al. 2002) describe &ldquo;SETA&rdquo;,
a system that personalizes the products featured, the use of graphics, and
the length and terminology of product descriptions on an e-tailing website.
A demonstration can be found at http://www.di.unito.it/&sim;seta/seta.htm.
SETA employs a user-based collaborative filtering system that associates each
user with a &ldquo;stereotype,&rdquo; then predicts preferences for product attributes,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27.4 Selecting Media 737
</p>
<p>styles of presentation, etc., based on the probability the user belongs to each
stereotype (see also Kohrs and Merialdo 2001). The probability is based on
how well the available information for the user matches each stereotype. The
more information available for the user the more accurate this probability
distribution is, and hence the predictions are more accurate. If the user reg-
isters at the website, the information can be stored and grows over time. If
the user does not register, the system starts with a generic presentation and
then learns more about the customer as the customer navigates through the
site.
</p>
<p>Between customer-response models and machine learning systems, there
is great potential for personalizing all aspects of a database marketing
communication. More work is needed both to develop and test these
methods.
</p>
<p>27.4 Selecting Media
</p>
<p>27.4.1 Optimization
</p>
<p>Database marketers have a plethora of outlets through which to commu-
nicate with customers, including direct mail, e-mail, telephone, the Inter-
net, and catalogs (Tellis 1998). Selecting which media vehicle(s) to use is
amenable to the same approaches that have been used for vehicle selection
in mass marketing (see Tellis, Chapter 16; Lilien et al. 1992, Chapter 6). The
basic requirements are response functions for each medium, and the degree
of overlap between media. For example, if a database marketer purchases
1,000,000 Internet impressions, and e-mails a list of 1,000,000 addresses, what
would be the net number of individuals exposed to the campaign? To our
knowledge, no research has yet investigated this issue or the general prob-
lem of vehicle selection in a database marketing context. To formulate the
problem, let
</p>
<p>E = Number of times customer is exposed to the offer.
Xi= Number of insertions of the offer in vehicle i.
i = 1, . . . , N where N is the total number of vehicles.
P (E|X1, X2, . . . , XN ) = Probability a randomly selected customer will be
</p>
<p>exposed to the offer E times, given the vehicle selection strategy
X1, X2, . . . , XN .
</p>
<p>λ = Parameter depicting decreasing returns to multiple exposures.
(1 &minus; e&minus;λE) = Probability a randomly selected customer will respond to an
</p>
<p>offer, given he or she is exposed to it E times.
Ci = Cost per insertion in vehicle i.
B = Budget.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>738 27 Designing Database Marketing Communications
</p>
<p>Then the optimization problem is:
</p>
<p>Max
X1X2...XN
</p>
<p>N&sum;
E=1
</p>
<p>(1&minus; e&minus;λE)P (E|X1X2 . . . XN ) (27.11)
</p>
<p>such that
N&sum;
i=1
</p>
<p>CiXi = B (27.12)
</p>
<p>Equation 27.11 shows the goal is to select media {X1, X2, . . . , XN} to max-
imize average response rate (equivalent to maximizing the total number of
responses). The average response rate is the sum of the customer response
rates for each number of possible exposures, weighted by the probability the
customer receives that number of exposures. The optimal vehicle selection
also must satisfy the budget constraint (Equation 27.12).
</p>
<p>The key parameters are the response parameter λ and the exposure prob-
ability function P . λ could be estimated judgmentally or through testing.
The exposure probability function is a frequency distribution estimated for
example by Rice (1988) or Rust et al. (1986) in the context of mass media.
</p>
<p>The approach can easily be made more complex, and potentially more
effective. First is that individual customers may differ in their response rates.
We would have λc, where c labels the customer. Second, λ may depend on
vehicle, so that we have λi. Finally, λ could depend both on customer and
vehicle, λci.
</p>
<p>The importance of adjusting λ by vehicle is illustrated by Sherman and
Deighton (2001). They consider the problem of selecting websites on the
Internet for a banner advertising campaign. The goal of the campaign was
to induce web surfers to visit the drugstore.com website. The task was to
identify the websites on which drugstore.com should place banner ads in order
to maximize visits to its website. The approach was to estimate a predictive
model predicting visits to the drugstore.com website as a function of visits
to other websites. The results yielded an &ldquo;affinity&rdquo; between the websites and
drugstore.com. Then a cluster analysis was used to group websites by various
website attributes, and the affinity for each cluster was then calculated. This
enabled the researchers to identify clusters, and hence websites, that had
particular affinities for drugstore.com. These websites were then targeted
with banner ads.
</p>
<p>The results were quite favorable. The high-affinity sites generated 10 times
the purchases per impression as were generated by the low-affinity sites. One
site generated 43% of all orders using just 32% of the overall budget.
</p>
<p>Sherman and Deighton show that response rates differ across websites and
hence should be incorporated in Equations 27.11 and 27.12. The study also
shows that predictive modeling can be used to increase website visits. The
study focuses only on the response of individual sites and does not consider</p>

<p>27.5 Evaluating Communications Programs 739
</p>
<p>decreasing returns to repetition as in Equation 27.11. It could be that placing
ads on several websites within an affinity cluster creates duplication. This
means that it may have been possible to improve the allocation. However,
the example shows clearly that starting with a relatively simple approach can
generate important gains.
</p>
<p>27.4.2 Integrated Marketing Communications
</p>
<p>The analysis in Sect. 27.4.1 assumes media vehicles have to be selected to dis-
tribute a given offer. The more general case is that different messages might
be distributed in different vehicles. For example, mass television advertising
may be used to create awareness for the product, and the Internet may be
used to extend a promotional offer. The &ldquo;ads&rdquo; themselves would be differ-
ent. However, the concept of &ldquo;integrated marketing communications&rdquo; (IMC)
posits that the content of these ads should be coordinated. The basic tenet
of IMC is that the firm benefits by consistency, or at least complementarity,
in its advertising messages.
</p>
<p>IMC is especially important in database marketing because the modern
database marketer sends out many different communications. Sheehan and
Doherty (2001) discuss IMC in a database marketing context. They measure
the degree of coordination in advertising messages between print and online
advertising for 186 companies. They collected their data by first finding a
print ad; then going to the company website to assess the consistency between
the ads. The authors find a higher degree of coordination in certain aspects
of the advertising but not in others. For example, in 82.8% of cases, the
same logo could be found on both the website and the print ad. However, the
&ldquo;promise or single most important message of the print advertisement&rdquo; was
easily found on the website only 38.6% of the time. It was found albeit with
difficulty 33.9% of the time, and not found at all 27.5% of the time.
</p>
<p>Sheehan and Doherty show that companies do not necessarily coordinate
their communication strategy across advertising vehicles. The next step is to
assess empirically the importance of coordination in a database marketing
context.
</p>
<p>27.5 Evaluating Communications Programs
</p>
<p>Four methods for evaluating a communications program are: (1) calcula-
tion of profits, (2) post hoc statistical analysis, (3) embedded testing, and
(4) surveys.
</p>
<p>Often a database marketing communications campaign can be evaluated
directly by calculating profits. For a direct marketing campaign, the general</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>740 27 Designing Database Marketing Communications
</p>
<p>form of the calculation is:
</p>
<p>Π = NrM &minus;Nc (27.13)
where
</p>
<p>Π = Profits
N = Number of contacts (e.g., number of pieces mailed)
r = Response rate
M = Profit margin per response
c = Contact cost
</p>
<p>Another important measure is return on investment or ROI:
</p>
<p>ROI =
NrM &minus;Nc
</p>
<p>Nc
=
</p>
<p>rM &minus; c
c
</p>
<p>(27.14)
</p>
<p>ROI is the profits earned by the program divided by its cost. It has become
popular to talk about &ldquo;marketing ROI,&rdquo; and the strong advantage of the
concept is that it is comparable across programs, companies, and industries.
It also has high face validity: &ldquo;For every dollar invested, we made [ROI] dol-
lars in profit.&rdquo; However, one problem is that ROI is oblivious to scale. Is
it better to make $2,000,000 on a $1,000,000 investment or $200,000 on a
$10,000 investment (ROI = $2 per dollar versus $20 per dollar)? As dis-
cussed in Chapter 10, &ldquo;Type I error&rdquo; decision-making &ndash; where the goal is
to avoid investments that would not have paid out, rather than avoid not
making investments that would have paid out &ndash; emphasizes ROI. Shrink-
ing the denominator of Equation 27.14 may inherently increase ROI, because
the smaller investment is made on the customers who are sure to pay out.
However, the total profits may not be impressive.
</p>
<p>Another important issue with both Equations 27.13 and 27.14 is they typ-
ically are single channel, not multiple channel calculations. The multichannel
company runs the risk that a marketing effort in Channel A takes away from
Channel B. For example, a bank conducting a direct mail campaign to sell
credit cards may take away from credit card sales in the its branch offices.
Communications evaluation in a multichannel context requires data on to-
tal sales, not just those generated through the channel through which the
communication was distributed.
</p>
<p>Statistical analysis to evaluate communications falls under the rubric of
&ldquo;marketing mix modeling.&rdquo; These analyses take the form of regression models
such as:
</p>
<p>Salest = β0 + β1 Marketingt + β2 Seasonalityt + εt (27.15)
</p>
<p>The coefficient β1 measures the increase in sales per dollar increase in mar-
keting expenditure. To calculate total profits, one would multiply the total
marketing expenditure during the period of interest times β1 to yield to-
tal sales generated, and then apply the margin percentage to calculate total</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>27.5 Evaluating Communications Programs 741
</p>
<p>profits or ROI. Equation 27.15 is an outline of a marketing mix model. There
are several other variables that might be included (e.g., other marketing ef-
forts besides the campaign being evaluated, competitive marketing efforts,
and carryover effects of marketing). The reader is referred to Leeflang et al.
(2000) for a thorough discussion (also see Dean 2006).
</p>
<p>Equation 27.15 can be estimated for each of the company&rsquo;s channels. For
a retail bank, there would be equations for mail-order and branch sales of
credit cards. It is possible that β1 would be positive in the mail-order equation
but negative in the branch equation, signifying cross-channel cannibalization.
This provides important learning as well as the &ldquo;bottom line&rdquo; profits of the
campaign.
</p>
<p>In practice, regression modeling can become quite complex and one is
never sure that all possible influencers of sales during the period of interest
have been included. Therefore, a good practice is to embed a &ldquo;control group&rdquo;
within the full launch of the campaign to provide an experimental test of the
campaign. That is, the full credit card campaign might have been mailed to
1,000,000 customers, but an additional 10,000 were not mailed the campaign
to provide a control. Profit is calculated by comparing sales, and hence profit,
per customer in the campaign group versus the control group.
</p>
<p>A few issues are important in using embedded tests. First, sales data need
to be collected for all customers across all channels. In the banking example,
the control group will be of no use if the bank cannot compile credit card
sales for all its customers across both direct mail and in-branch channels.
Second, the control group must be randomly selected from the group eligible
for the campaign. For example, the customers selected to receive the direct
mail credit card piece might have scored in the top four deciles as classified
from a predictive model (Chapter 10). The 10,000 control customers must be
selected from that group, not from the bottom six deciles. This means that
the company is incurring an opportunity cost in not mailing to the control
group, since they are prime prospects for the campaign (Chapter 9). That
is why the sample size for the control group in an embedded test should be
much smaller than the full mailing.
</p>
<p>Testing plays a crucial role both in campaign design and evaluation. In
the banking example, a test mailing to 30,000 customers could provide data
for a predictive model. That model would be used to score the company&rsquo;s
1,000,000 customers, 400,000 of whom might fall in the top four deciles that
are profitable. Of those 400,000 customers, the mailing might go to 390,000,
with 10,000 held out as a control. The first test is crucial for targeting the
campaign; the second test is crucial for evaluating it.
</p>
<p>Customer surveys are especially important for evaluating qualitative as-
pects of the campaign such as reinforcing product positioning. The company
may survey a subgroup (e.g., 500&ndash;1,000) of its customers after the campaign
to make sure the product and company is being perceived according to plan.
The time and expense of conducting surveys may preclude evaluating every
communication using a survey. However, periodic use of surveys can be an</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>742 27 Designing Database Marketing Communications
</p>
<p>important way to ensure a firm&rsquo;s database marketing efforts are not leading
the company astray from its desired positioning and target group.
</p>
<p>In summary, communications campaigns can be evaluated using direct cal-
culations, post hoc statistical analysis, embedded tests, and surveys. Direct
calculations are the easiest when there are no &ldquo;externalities&rdquo; to worry about,
such as cross-channel cannibalization. Embedded tests are easy to &ldquo;read&rdquo;
and the opportunity cost is worth the clean calculation of profits. However,
testing may not always be practical. For example, a direct response television
campaign cannot be randomly targeted to some customers within a given lo-
cale and not targeted to others. Post hoc statistical analyses become essential
(Tellis et al. 2000). Surveys are especially useful for evaluating the qualitative
objectives of a campaign, and can be an important source of insight for the
database marketing firm that can easily get caught up with the immediate
&ldquo;bottom line&rdquo; while losing sight of the long term.</p>

<p>Chapter 28
</p>
<p>Multiple Campaign Management
</p>
<p>Abstract Many database marketing programs are constructed as one-shot
efforts &ndash; they determine the best campaign to implement now. However, more
recently, academics and companies have recognized that the actions we take
now influence what actions we will be compelled to take in the future, and if
the current actions are not managed correctly, these future actions will not be
successful. The key is to manage the series of communications holistically, tak-
ing into account the future as we design the current campaign, and to do so at
the customer level. This chapter discusses &ldquo;optimal contact models&rdquo; for man-
aging a series of campaigns. Many of the examples we draw on involve the cat-
alog industry, although we also discuss examples involving e-mails, product
magazines, promotional discounts, and even online survey panel management.
</p>
<p>28.1 Overview
</p>
<p>Managing multiple campaigns is an emerging issue in database marketing
due to the confluence of two forces: First, optimizing a single contact using
a predictive model has become commonplace &ndash; we know how to do this and
can do it well. Second, there is concern that customers are becoming clut-
tered with direct marketing communications such as catalogs, e-mails, online
advertising, etc.
</p>
<p>Multiple campaigns can be managed by &ldquo;optimal contact models.&rdquo; These
models specify the number and/or schedule of communications including cat-
alogs, e-mails, online advertising, even requests for online panelists to partic-
ipate in surveys, at the customer level. Two factors make this a challenging
task. First is dynamic customer response. Customer response to a contact
changes over time, depending on the customer&rsquo;s previous contact and re-
sponse history. Second, because of response dynamics, a natural way to op-
timize the schedule of contacts over time is to be &ldquo;forward looking,&rdquo; i.e.,
recommend decisions for period t taking into account the impact this has
on customer response and hence future profits in period t + 1, t + 2, etc. In
Section 28.2 we discuss dynamic response. In Section 28.3 we discuss optimal
contact models.

<p>Fig. 28.1 Wear-in, wear-out, and forgetting.
</p>
<p>28.2 Dynamic Response Phenomena
</p>
<p>28.2.1 Wear-in, Wear-out, and Forgetting
</p>
<p>These phenomena were first identified in the advertising literature (see Lit-
tle 1979) but we explain them in the context of mailing catalogs to cus-
tomers. Wear-in means it takes several mailed catalogs before the customer
responds &ndash; it takes several mailings before we fully capture the customer&rsquo;s
attention. Wear-out means that once a critical number of mailings is reached,
subsequent catalogs produce lower response rates. The customer may no
longer be paying attention to the catalog. Forgetting means that once mail-
ings are halted, response does not instantly go to zero but decays gradually.
This is because the customer still has the previous catalog(s) on hand, al-
though eventually discards them. Figure 28.1 shows the three phenomena.
</p>
<p>While wear-out is explained most easily by a lack of attention, there are
three additional possibilities. First is that too much information confuses
customers to the point that they make incorrect decisions (Assael 1995, pp.
231&ndash;232; Jacoby et al. 1974), or to make more mistakes in evaluating brands
(Hutchinson and Alba 1991). A second explanation is that the customer gets
angry at the constant &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; and refuses to buy. Third, the customer&rsquo;s
needs could have been satiated by earlier catalogs.
</p>
<p>Wear-in and forgetting can be modeled with a stock variable:
</p>
<p>Stock t = λStock t&minus;1 + βCt (28.1)
</p>
<p>Ct is an indicator variable (0&ndash;1) of whether a catalog was mailed to the
customer in period t. The parameters λ(0 &lt; λ &lt; 1) and β(β &gt; 0) refer to</p>

<p>The stock model includes wear-in and forgetting but not wear-out. Simon
(1982) devised a simple way to accommodate wear-out and forgetting, as</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>Fig. 28.3 Simon&rsquo;s (1982) model of wear-out and forgetting (Equation 28.3.)&lowast;
&lowast;Prob(Buy)t = 0.7Stockt&minus;1 + 0.01Ct + 0.05max(0,Ct &minus; Ct&minus;1)
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>Stockt = λStockt&minus;1 + βCt + δmax(0, Ct &minus; Ct&minus;1) (28.3)
</p>
<p>The term Ct &minus;Ct&minus;1 creates an immediate increase (&ldquo;shock&rdquo;) in stock when-
ever a catalog is mailed in the current period after not being mailed in the
previous period. High values for δ boost stock higher than its maximum
(β/(1 &minus; λ)). As more catalogs are mailed, stock declines (wears out) to this
value. Figure 28.3 shows Equation 28.3 for specific values of the parameters.
Wear-out and forgetting are clearly visible in the figure.
</p>
<p>An even more flexible model that includes wear-in, wear-out, and forget-
ting is:
</p>
<p>Stockt = λStockt&minus;1 + βtCt + δShockStockt (28.4a)
ShockStockt = λ&prime;ShockStockt&minus;1 + β&prime;Max(0, Ct &minus; Ct&minus;1) (28.4b)
βt = λ&prime;&prime;βt&minus;1 + β&prime;&prime;Ct (28.4c)
</p>
<p>Equation 28.4b smoothes the Max(0, Ct &minus;Ct&minus;1) shock variable. It peaks im-
mediately at β&prime; and then decays by a factor λ&prime;. Equation 28.4c grows the
immediate impact of catalog mailings up to a maximum β&lowast; = (β&prime;&prime;/(1&minus;λ&prime;&prime;)).
The net result is that the maximum induced by the Ct &minus; Ct&minus;1 shock is not
realized until some delay, creating a wear-in effect. Once we reach that max-
imum, we have wear-out down to the level β&lowast;/(1 &minus; λ), and then forgetting
by the factor λ once the mailing stops (see Fig. 28.4).
</p>
<p>One can graph the number of communications made over several periods
versus response aggregated over several customers. This &ldquo;aggregate response
function&rdquo; can take on several shapes depending on the degree of wear-in,
wear-out, and forgetting occurring at the micro level (see Fig. 28.5).</p>

<p>Fig. 28.5 Aggregate response functions depending on degree of wear-in and wear-out.
</p>
<p>Wear-out is an especially crucial phenomenon because it provides a non-
cost reason to limit the number of contacts. Fewer mailings may actually
produce more sales (see Fig. 28.6). With 20 consecutive weeks of catalogs,
response peaks relatively soon and then starts to wear out. However, with
catalog &ldquo;pulsing,&rdquo; the wear-out effect is mitigated and the total expected
response increases. This is why aggregate response as a function of contacts
can be inverse U-shaped as in Fig. 28.5d.
</p>
<p>Ansari et al. (2008) estimate λ&rsquo;s ranging from 0.04 to 0.14 for e-mails
and catalogs using weekly data, implying fast wear-in as well as forgetting.1
</p>
<p>Gönül et al. (2000) include time since the last catalog was received in a cat-
alog response model. Its estimated coefficient was negative, consistent with
forgetting. The authors also include the cumulative number of catalogs re-
ceived after the last purchase and find a negative relationship. This supports
wear-out. Campbell et al. (2001) report wear-out regarding net returns as a
function of &ldquo;advertising expenditure.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Eastlick et al. (1993) asked catalog buyers how many catalogs they re-
ceived in the past 12 months, and how much they purchased during that time.
The researchers fit a regression across buyers and find an inverse U-shaped
relationship between catalogs and expenditures. This is consistent with very
</p>
<p>1 Note that estimates of λ can be biased upward when data are temporally aggregated,
e.g., to the monthly or quarterly levels (see Leeflang et al. 2000, pp. 85&ndash;91. Estimating
on the weekly level is therefore advisable.</p>

<p>28.2 Dynamic Response Phenomena 749
</p>
<p>Fig. 28.6 With high wear-out, pulsing produces more responses than constant mailing,
even with fewer total mailings. (a) Constant mailing strategy (total response = 0.580);
(b) Pulsing mailing strategy (total response = 0.810)
Note: Model used to generate graphs based on Equations 28.4a&ndash;28.4c parameterized as
follows:
</p>
<p>Stockt = 0.1&lowast;Stockt&minus;1 +βt&lowast;Ct + 0.05&lowast;ShockStockt

βt = 0.4
</p>
<p>&lowast;βt&minus;1 + 0.01&lowast;Ct
</p>
<p>We also assume that stock translates linearly into response, whether it be response rate,
revenues, etc. One could in general assume Response = f(Stockt), where &ldquo;f&rdquo; is a nonlinear
function.
</p>
<p>strong wear-out as in Fig. 28.5. Ganzach and Ben-Or (1996) note the authors
did not distinguish between strong wear-out and very strong wear-out. Fein-
berg et al. (1996) reply that the wear-out is visible in the data. However, they
note that only a &ldquo;low number of subjects&rdquo; received more than the estimated
overload point.
</p>
<p>28.2.2 Overlap
</p>
<p>The database marketer contacts its customers with different communications.
For example, L.L. Bean has a male clothing catalog, a women&rsquo;s catalog, etc.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>750 28 Multiple Campaign Management
</p>
<p>The degree of content overlap between communications might moderate the
wear-in, wear-out, and forgetting phenomena. For example, Equation 28.1
might be extended as follows:
</p>
<p>Stockt = (λ+ λsSim)&lowast;Stockt&minus;1 + (β + βsSim)&lowast;Ct (28.5)
</p>
<p>where Sim is the similarity between the current and previous catalogs.
Campbell et al. (2001) include overlap in a model of catalog profits as fol-
lows2:
</p>
<p>Profit = Rp(1&minus; Sqp) +Rq(1&minus; Spq) (28.6)
</p>
<p>where Rp(q) is the profit from catalog p(q), and SAB is the &ldquo;saturative&rdquo;
effect of catalog A on catalog B. Spq = 0.05 means that catalog q&rsquo;s profits
are reduced by 5% when catalog p is also mailed. The authors model the
saturative effect as:
</p>
<p>SAB = [time index (A,B)]&lowast;[similarity index (A,B)] (28.7)
</p>
<p>Both indices are between 0 and 1. The similarity index captures content
overlap &ndash; if A and B are the same catalogs, similarity equals 1. The time
index captures proximity of mail dates. If the catalogs are mailed at exactly
the same time, the time index equals 1. So the greater the content overlap
between closely mailed catalogs, the more saturation. The authors indeed
find cannibalization between catalogs mailed close to each other.
</p>
<p>28.2.3 Purchase Acceleration, Loyalty,
and Price Sensitivity Effects
</p>
<p>Database marketing communications often entail promotions. Catalogs con-
tain descriptive information, but they are similar to weekly store circulars
in that they list products and prices. E-mails as well as online advertising
are also similar to feature advertising. In addition, all these communications
often offer price discounts.
</p>
<p>Database marketing communications therefore can produce the same long-
term effects as do promotions. These include accelerating forward in time
sales that would have occurred anyway (Blattberg et al. 1981; Neslin et al.
1985; Macé and Neslin 2004), changing brand loyalty (Guadagni and Lit-
tle 1983; Gedenk and Neslin 1999; Seetharaman 2004), and increasing price
sensitivity (Mela et al. 1997; Jedidi et al. 1999).
</p>
<p>2 Note this differs a little bit from equation 1 in Campbell et al. (2001, p. 89), but is
consistent with their definition of saturation on page 81.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28.2 Dynamic Response Phenomena 751
</p>
<p>Findings of a negative impact of recency (the more recently the customer
has purchased, the less likely the customer is to purchase now) suggest pur-
chase acceleration, assuming the recent purchase was stimulated by commu-
nication. Ansari et al. (2008) and Gönül et al. (2000) find evidence of negative
recency effects.
</p>
<p>Anderson and Simester (2004) studied the long-term impact of promo-
tion depth. Each of three experiments included a &ldquo;control&rdquo; and &ldquo;promo-
tion&rdquo; catalog. Both catalogs had the same number of promotional prices,
clearly communicated as &ldquo;Regular Price $X, Sale $Y,&rdquo; but Y was smaller
for the promotion catalog. Purchasers were followed for at least 24 months,
and all purchasers, whether in the control or promotion group, received
the same catalogs during this period. In all three tests, the promotions
clearly increased sales. But the key question was, what happened in the long
term?
</p>
<p>The authors investigate acceleration, repeat purchasing, and price-
sensitivity effects. They also determine whether promotions draw a different
group of customers. They find evidence for all these effects. For example, pro-
motion purchasers bought fewer units in months 1&ndash;12 after purchasing from
a promotional catalog than they did in months 13&ndash;24. This is suggestive of
acceleration.
</p>
<p>They also found that promotion purchasers bought fewer units after the
purchase compared to non-promotion purchasers. This effect however van-
ished when the authors controlled for selection, i.e., they found that the
promotion catalog drew a lower RFM customer and after controlling for this,
the number of units purchased in the future was unaffected by promotion
(see Neslin and Shoemaker 1989). The authors found that customers who
were infrequent, not recent purchasers bought additional units in the future,
whereas the number of units subsequently purchased by higher RF groups
was unaffected. This suggests that inexperienced, low RF customers learned
about the positive aspects of the product due to the purchase experience in-
duced by the promotion. Finally, the authors found that customers who had
historically paid high prices purchased at lower prices after purchasing on
a steep promotion, whereas customers who had historically paid low prices
continued to do so. This is consistent with sensitizing heretofore not-price-
sensitive customers to buying on deal.
</p>
<p>Overall, there is some evidence, mostly through Anderson and Simester&rsquo;s
study, that database marketing communications can act like promotions and
induce the same long-term effects observed in the promotions literature (see
Neslin 2002). More empirical work is needed to measure these effects in other
settings (e.g., e-mail communications, non-promotional catalogs, etc.), but
the evidence suggests that optimal contact models need to consider these
issues. For example, a communication may accelerate a purchase, so it would
not make sense to communicate again until sufficient time had elapsed for
the customer to need the product again.</p>

<p>28.2.4 Including Wear-in, Wear-out, Forgetting,
Overlap, Acceleration, and Loyalty
</p>
<p>Ansari et al. (2008) develop a model to study customer channel migration
that includes wear-in, wear-out, forgetting, acceleration, and loyalty. They
refer to the first four phenomena as &ldquo;communication effects,&rdquo; while the last
two they call &ldquo;experience effects.&rdquo; The communications model is:
</p>
<p>Communication Effect it = Direct Effect it + Interaction Effectsit
(28.8)
</p>
<p>The communication effect includes the impact of all communications cur-
rently and previously received by customer i on that consumer&rsquo;s decisions at
time t.
</p>
<p>The direct effect is each communication&rsquo;s impact in isolation and al-
lows the model to capture wear-in and forgetting. The interactions are be-
tween communications and allow the model to capture wear-out and overlap.
Specifically,
</p>
<p>Direct Effect it =
&sum;
c&isin;C
</p>
<p>βicλ
τict
c dict (28.9a)
</p>
<p>Interaction Effectsit =

</p>
<p>c,c&prime;&isin;C
δicc&prime;λ
</p>
<p>τict
c λ
</p>
<p>τic&prime;t
c&prime; dictdic&prime;t (28.9b)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>C = Set of all communications distributed by the firm. Particular communi-
cations are denoted by c or c&prime;.
</p>
<p>βic = Direct response of customer i to communication c.
λc = Decay parameter for communication c.
τict = Time since customer i received communication c, as of period t.
dict = Step indicator equal to 1 if customer i received communication c on
</p>
<p>or before period t; 0 otherwise. The indicator turns on once the customer
has received the communication, and remains on thereafter.
</p>
<p>δicc&prime; = Interaction response of customer i between communications c and c&prime;.
</p>
<p>The model does not measure overlap explicitly, but the authors model the
δ&rsquo;s, as well as the β&rsquo;s and λ&rsquo;s, as functions of communication attributes. The
attributes could include content (e.g., men vs. women&rsquo;s catalogs, etc.) as well
as vehicle types (catalog vs. e-mails). Indeed they find that the interaction
terms between like vehicles (catalogs and catalogs; e-mails and e-mails) are
generally stronger than between different vehicles (catalogs and e-mails). This
suggests an overlap effect due to vehicle overlap.
</p>
<p>That the direct effects determine wear-in and forgetting is shown in Fig.
28.7a. In that figure, all the interactions (δ) are set equal to zero. We see that
over the course of four communications, response builds toward a maximum,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28.3 Optimal Contact Models 753
</p>
<p>then declines to zero, although not instantly, once the communications end.
Figure 28.7b demonstrates that with negative interactions, the model pro-
duces wear-out. In this example, the first two communications have a stronger
interaction than any other pair. The effect is so strong that response declines
when the second communication is delivered. This could be due to strong
overlap between the first two communications.
</p>
<p>Equation 28.9b captures the timing effects suggested by Campbell et al.
(2001). Wear-out/overlap effects will be strongest when communications are
delivered consecutively (because the λ terms for both communications will
be relatively large).
</p>
<p>Ansari et al. capture repeat purchase and acceleration effects through
lagged incidence, order size, or channel choice variables. For example, they
include a variable called &ldquo;Wuse&rdquo; equal to log(1+ the cumulative number of
purchases made on the Internet). They find this variable has a negative aver-
age coefficient in their purchase incidence model, suggesting that purchasing
on the Internet decreases future purchase incidence. They include a recency
variable, &ldquo;since,&rdquo; equal to the time since the previous purchase. The coeffi-
cient for this variable was positive on average, meaning that it is less likely
the customer will purchase in the current period if the customer has pur-
chased last period. Since the marketing variables being studied &ndash; catalogs
and e-mails &ndash; made it more likely that a purchase took place, this suggests
purchase acceleration.
</p>
<p>28.3 Optimal Contact Models
</p>
<p>Optimal contact models determine the number and/or schedule of commu-
nications to be delivered to each customer in a given time frame. These
models consist of a response model and an optimization. The response model
predicts how the customer will respond to a particular &ldquo;contact.&rdquo; This de-
pends on the &ldquo;state&rdquo; the customer is in at a given point in time, for ex-
ample, how long it has been since the customer was last contacted. Re-
sponse is probabilistic &ndash; there is uncertainty as to whether the customer
will respond. The optimization is often forward looking because actions the
firm takes in the current period may influence the actions it should take
in future periods. For example, if we contact the customer now, we may
need to wait a few periods before it becomes worthwhile to contact the cus-
tomer again. The probabilistic and forward looking aspects suggest that op-
timal contact models be formulated as a stochastic dynamic program (Ross
1983; Bertsekas 1995). This technique is designed to handle optimizations
where the outcomes of firm decisions are probabilistic and there are dy-
namics in the response to these decisions. For example, the first optimal</p>

<p>28.3 Optimal Contact Models 755
</p>
<p>contact model we discuss (Ching et al. 2004) makes direct use of this
methodology.
</p>
<p>28.3.1 A Promotions Model (Ching et al. 2004)
</p>
<p>28.3.1.1 Response Model
</p>
<p>Ching et al. (2004) develop a stochastic dynamic program to decide when to
offer a promotion to customers of a computer services company. Customers
are assigned to one of four states depending on their usage in the previous
week: (1) 0 min, (2) 1&ndash;20 min, (3) 21&ndash;40 min, (4) &gt; 40min. Using historical
data, the authors estimate Pikj , the probability the customer moves from
state i to k, if the customer receives promotion j. Both i and k take on
values 1, 2, 3, or 4; j can equal 1 (promotion), or 2 (no promotion). The
authors calculate cji , the expected revenue from a customer in state i who
receives promotion j. The state definitions, &ldquo;transition probabilities&rdquo; P jik,
and revenues cji are the ingredients for a stochastic dynamic program.
</p>
<p>28.3.1.2 Optimization Model
</p>
<p>In each period, the firm can observe what state the customer is in. The
question is whether to promote or not to promote to this customer. This
problem can be formulated as the following recursion:
</p>
<p>vi(t) = Max
j=1,2
</p>
<p>{
cji &minus; dj + δ
</p>
<p>4&sum;
k=1
</p>
<p>pjikvk(t&minus; 1)
}
</p>
<p>(28.10)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>vi(t) = The expected optimal revenue given the customer is in state i and
there are t periods remaining in the planning horizon.
</p>
<p>dj = Cost of implementing promotion j (j = 1 or 2).
δ = Discount rate applied to future profits.
</p>
<p>The cji&minus;dj term represents expected profits in period t depending on whether
the firm promotes (j = 1) or not (j = 2). The δ
</p>
<p>&sum;4
k=1 p
</p>
<p>j
ikvk(t &minus; 1) term
</p>
<p>represents the discounted expected profit for the remaining t &minus; 1 periods
after the current period. Depending on whether the firm promotes or not
in the current period, the customer progresses with probability pjik to state
k in the next period, and if so, expected optimal revenues are vk(t &minus; 1).
The expression of the optimization in this recursive form is a fundamental
&ldquo;principle of optimality&rdquo; in dynamic programming. It says that the optimal
solution can be determined by deciding what to do in the current period,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>756 28 Multiple Campaign Management
</p>
<p>taking into account the repercussions for future periods. Appropriately, vi(t)
is called the &ldquo;value function.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Equation 28.10 assumes a finite time horizon. In this case the optimal
solution will prescribe what action to take if the customer is found to be
in state i at time t. The authors also consider the infinite horizon problem,
which assumes the firm is maximizing over an infinite period. This may sound
a bit unrealistic (will the firm be in existence forever!), but the discount factor
effectively limits the time horizon, and makes the model an optimization of
lifetime value. When considering an infinite horizon, the stochastic dynamic
program prescribes what action should be taken in &ldquo;steady state,&rdquo; i.e., for
any arbitrary period, the optimal action is determined solely by what state
the customer is in.
</p>
<p>Steady state solutions can be obtained using various techniques, includ-
ing successive approximations, policy improvement, and linear programming
(Ross 1983, pp. 35&ndash;42). Finite horizon solutions can be obtained by solving
Equation 28.10 using backward induction. Ching et al. solve the infinite hori-
zon version of their model using linear programming and the finite horizon
version using backward induction. They include computer programs in Excel
that illustrate. Their application finds, intuitively, that if promotion costs (d)
are large, they should only be used for inactive customers (state 1). However,
if the cost is small, the promotion should be used for light users (state 2). In
the finite horizon case, the authors also impose the constraint that a maxi-
mum of four promotions can be administered. They find (for low promotion
costs), that promotions should be administered to inactive customers as soon
as possible, while generally speaking the light users should receive their pro-
motions as late as possible. The first result is intuitive, while the latter may
be due to the particular pjik&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>The Ching et al. model is a straightforward yet powerful example of deriv-
ing an optimal contact strategy from a stochastic dynamic program. Many
optimal contact models either embellish the state definitions, the response
function, or the optimization requirements. However, these can be nontrivial
improvements, both managerially and technically.
</p>
<p>28.3.2 Using a Decision Tree Response Model
(Simester et al. 2006)
</p>
<p>28.3.2.1 Response Model
</p>
<p>Simester et al. (2006) design an optimal contact model for a single catalog.
Their approach is particularly rich in its use of a decision tree for the response
model (Chapter 17). Customer states are defined based on which end node of
the tree the customer is classified in at a given point in time. The authors&rsquo;
decision tree method is distinctive in two respects: (1) the dependent vari-
able is a measure of long-term potential, not response to a single catalog;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28.3 Optimal Contact Models 757
</p>
<p>(2) they develop a decision tree algorithm for handling this continuous
dependent variable. The end nodes of the decision tree define customer states.
This is an innovative approach. The alternative would be to use a decision
tree with 0&ndash;1 response as the dependent variable. However, the authors use
both response and expenditure, and the long term rather than the short term,
to define their dependent variable and derive their customer states.
</p>
<p>28.3.2.2 Optimization Model
</p>
<p>The stochastic dynamic program is set up as follows:
</p>
<p>V π(s) = Er,T,s&prime; [rs,π(s) + δTV π(s&prime;)|s, π(s)] (28.11)
where:
</p>
<p>π(s) = Mailing policy; a decision rule of whether or not to mail a catalog to
the customer who is in state s.
</p>
<p>V π(s) = Expected long-term profits for the customer in state s under mailing
policy π.
</p>
<p>rs,π(s) = Immediate period profits for the customer in state s under mailing
policy π.
</p>
<p>δT = Discount factor given time T between catalog mailings.
</p>
<p>The random elements taken into account in the expected value are the short-
term response r, the time T between mailings, and the future states s&prime; that
customer may enter as a result of the mailing policy. Equation 28.11 is a
value function. It says that the expected long-term profits for the customer
in state s under policy π is the sum of the current period optimal profits plus
expected future optimal profits.
</p>
<p>The authors calculate that their method significantly increases profits over
the current policy used by the firm they study, especially if the future is not
highly discounted. This is sensible because the states are defined in terms
using long-term potential as the dependent variable. Their policy mails more
catalogs to customers who have not recently received catalogs, and few cata-
logs to customers who have recently received catalogs. The authors find that
profits increase with more states. However, this may simply be taking advan-
tage of chance variation. Indeed, in a holdout test, profits are independent of
the number of states (although still greater than under the current policy).
</p>
<p>The authors field test their approach over a 6-month period. They test
three customer groups (low, moderate, and high value), and two methods
(model versus current). They find the model improves profit for low and
moderate value customers, but decreases it for high value customers. The
model under-mails these customers relative to the current method, but by
the end of the test, the gap tightens. The authors diagnose the problem was
that the historical data were skewed toward mailing many catalogs to high
value customers. In prescribing fewer catalogs for these customers, the model</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>758 28 Multiple Campaign Management
</p>
<p>was going out of the range of the data. The lesson is that the historical
data for optimal contact models need to include ample variation in contacts.
Elsner et al. (2003, 2004) use field tests to generate the data to estimate their
response models.
</p>
<p>28.3.3 Using a Hazard Response Model
(Gönül et al. 2000)
</p>
<p>28.3.3.1 Response Model
</p>
<p>Gönül et al. (2000) develop a catalog optimal contact model based on a
proportional hazard response model (Cox 1972). The response model is:
</p>
<p>hi(t|X) = h0i(t)ψi(X) (28.12)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>t = Time since the last purchase.
hi(t|X) = The likelihood that customer i purchases at time t.
h0i(t) = The baseline hazard for customer i, due only to the passage of time
</p>
<p>t.
ψi(X) = The proportional covariate adjustment for customer i &ndash; due to
</p>
<p>covariates that vary across customers or over time.
</p>
<p>The authors operationalize Equation 28.12 as follows:
</p>
<p>hi(t|X) = exp(γ0i + γ1it+ γ2iln(t) + γ3it2) (28.13a)
ψi(X) = exp(β1MALEi + β2AV G CONSUMPi + α1iPROM RESTi
</p>
<p>+α2iWEAROUTi) (28.13b)
</p>
<p>The baseline hazard model captures recency, since t is the time since the last
purchase. Equation 28.13a can capture many monotonic and non-monotonic
relationships. The covariate adjustment consists of several multipliers. The
MALE variable allows for gender to influence response. AVG CONSUMP
is defined as the average daily expenditure of the household. It combines
frequency and monetary value.
</p>
<p>PROM REST is the number of periods since the last catalog was mailed
to the customer. The authors hypothesize that α1i should be negative to
reflect forgetting. The impact of a catalog in the current period is implied by
setting PROM REST to 0. WEAROUT is defined as the number of catalogs
since the last response. If α2i is negative the likelihood of responding in the
current period decreases if a large number of catalogs have been mailed since
the last purchase. This can be interpreted as wear-out. Note however that if
α2i is positive, that could be interpreted as wear-in.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28.3 Optimal Contact Models 759
</p>
<p>The model includes heterogeneous response in the baseline hazard (γ&rsquo;s)
and mailing response parameters (α&rsquo;s). The authors use a latent class
approach (Kamakura and Russell 1989) to model heterogeneity, yielding dif-
ferent parameters for each segment (i = 1, . . . , S). The authors account for
endogeneity of the catalog mailing variables (PROM REST andWEAROUT)
using instrumental variables. They use a logistic regression of catalogs mailed
as a function of RFM variables and use the predictions from this model to cal-
culate PROM REST and WEAROUT. Interestingly, they do not find much
impact of this procedure on their estimated parameters.
</p>
<p>The authors estimate their model for 979 customers. They find a two-
segment model fits best (S = 2). The product category is a durable good,
so the customer typically would not need to re-order until a long time had
elapsed since purchase. Accordingly, the authors find the baseline hazard
is monotonically increasing for Segment 1. However, it is U-shaped for the
second. Perhaps these customers order another product to augment the first
immediately after purchase, but baseline hazard then decreases and rises
again as the customer needs to replace the product(s).
</p>
<p>The authors find that males are less likely to respond (β1 &lt; 0) and that
heavy users are more likely to respond (β2 &gt; 0). They also find in both seg-
ments that a response is less likely if there has been a longer the time since
the last catalog was mailed (αi1 &lt; 0). This indicates forgetting is a real phe-
nomenon in catalog mailing. They find a significantly negative WEAROUT
coefficient in one segment (αi2 &lt; 0), suggesting wear-out.
</p>
<p>28.3.3.2 Optimization Model
</p>
<p>The optimal policy considers each customer at time t and recommends a
mailing at that time if expected profit over the period t + x is greater with
a mailing than without, where x is the time horizon. They find that the
qualitative findings for different x&rsquo;s do not vary for x &isin; [1, 12] and use x = 3.
Profit for customer i is:
</p>
<p>πi(Di) = mE(Ai)[DiP ci &minus; (1&minus;Di)Pni ]&minus; cDi (28.14)
where:
</p>
<p>Di = 1 if mail to customer i at time t; 0 if not.
πi(Di) = Profit earned on customer i over next x months depending on
</p>
<p>whether or not the customer is mailed a catalog.
m = Profit margin per response.
E(Ai) = Expected expenditure level for customer i over next x months if the
</p>
<p>customer purchases.
P ci , or P
</p>
<p>n
i = Probability that customer i purchases (&ldquo;responds&rdquo;) over the
</p>
<p>next x months depending on whether he or she receives a catalog at time
t (&ldquo;c&rdquo;) or does not receive a catalog (&ldquo;n&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>c = Cost of mailing catalog (production plus mail cost).</p>

</p>
<p>The hazard response model provides the response probability estimates. Note
Pni does not equal zero because the customer has been mailed catalogs before
and could order from those catalogs. The variables that change when the cus-
tomer receives a catalog are WEAROUT (increases by 1) and PROM REST
(resets to 0). Gönül et al. (2000) decision rule is to mail to customer i if:
</p>
<p>∆πi = πi(Di = 1)&minus; πi(Di = 0) &gt; 0 (28.15)
The authors apply their method to a durable household products catalog.
Table 28.1 compares the optimal and actual policies. Out of 108 customers
actually sent catalogs, 16 should have been sent the catalog. However 92 of
them (close to 90%) should not have been sent catalogs. The total expected
profit is $6,327 under the optimal policy compared to $5,968 under the actual
policy.
</p>
<p>These findings suggest the cataloger is mis-targeting catalogs. The authors
speculate this may be due to management not understanding the wear-out
and forgetting phenomena captured by the hazard model, or are not consid-
ering heterogeneity.
</p>
<p>The Gönül et al. (2000) approach is a rigorous, practical approach to
catalog mailing. The model is not a dynamic program in that it only optimizes
one mailing at a time. Gönül and Ter Hofstede (2006) extend the approach
to address this by considering a finite decision period of length P periods,
and evaluate 2P possible mailing schedules. They evaluate each schedule in
terms of the utility of the firm, using risk-neutral as well as risk-neutral profit
functions. They also use simulation to &ldquo;integrate out&rdquo; the uncertainty in
customer parameter values. The method evaluates each of the 2P schedules
separately. For a 52-week schedule, this could get prohibitive in terms of
computer resources. However, the authors show that P = 6 improves over
a myopic (P = 1) optimization, so practically speaking, the model promises
improvements over non-forward looking mail decisions.

</p>
<p>Equation 28.16a reflects diminishing returns to marketing efforts through
the log transformation (the &ldquo;1&rdquo; is to avoid having to take the log of zero).
Equation 28.16a represents the impact of behavioral and demographic vari-
ables on customer response to marketing. For example, the authors hypoth-
esized that in general, loyal customers would be more receptive to the rela-
tionship magazine and less receptive to direct mail.
</p>
<p>The model was estimated for 1,580 customers using MCMC methods im-
plemented in WinBugs. The dependent variable is change in profits over a
1-year horizon. The authors found several interesting results, generally sup-
portive of their hypothesis regarding loyalty. For example, cumulative number
of purchases had a negative impact on responsiveness to direct mail, whereas
had no impact on responsiveness to the relationship magazine. Membership
in the company&rsquo;s loyalty program had a stronger effect on response to the
magazine than it did to response to direct mail.
</p>
<p>28.3.4.2 Optimization Model
</p>
<p>The objective is to maximize each customer&rsquo;s change in profits in the coming
year:
</p>
<p>Πi,(t&minus;1)&rarr;t = ∆Ri,(t&minus;1)&rarr;t &minus;&minus;&rarr;M i&minus;&rarr;C (28.17)</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>762 28 Multiple Campaign Management
</p>
<p>where
&minus;&rarr;
C = {C1, C2} is the per unit cost per customer of direct mail and re-
</p>
<p>lationship magazines, respectively. Given this formulation and the response
function, the optimal level of marketing instrument k (k = direct mail, rela-
tionship magazine) for customer i can be obtained using simple calculus:
</p>
<p>M&lowast;ik =
βik
Ck
</p>
<p>&minus; 1 (28.18)
</p>
<p>Equation 28.18 says that more of marketing instrument k should be allocated
to customer i if customer i is more responsive to that instrument, and mar-
keting instrument k is less expensive. Since responsiveness is the only factor
that varies across customers, it is the key measure, and it is provided by the
estimation of Equations 28.16.
</p>
<p>The authors calculate the optimal level of marketing for each customer
and find it is quite heterogeneous due to heterogeneity in the response mea-
sures (β). They compare their model to three others: segmentation based on
demographics, segmentation based on RFM variables, and latent structure
segmentation. They find that their model fits better than the other two, and
that the predicted profits generated by their model are higher than those
generated by the competitive models. In particular, they find:
</p>
<p>Model Mean square
Error (Fit)
</p>
<p>Projected average
Profit (Guilders)
</p>
<p>Demographic 12.98 14.46
RFM 13.44 8.61
Latent class 23.49 3.12
Hierarchical 12.42 23.12
</p>
<p>Profits under the marketing plan currently used by the company generated
10.57 guilders, so the hierarchical model outperformed both the other models
and current practice.3
</p>
<p>The Rust and Verhoef model is a very practical yet rigorous approach to
deciding customer-specific investments in the intermediate term. Like Gönül
et al., it is not a dynamic optimization &ndash; it does not take into account the
investments made in the coming year have on long-term retention rates and
lifetime value. It does not explicitly model wear-in, wear-out, and forgetting,
and so could not be used to schedule marketing activities within the year.
However, the model does include decreasing returns on an aggregate basis, so
it implicitly accounts for these factors for the 1-year time horizon. The model
depends heavily on the customer-specific response parameters estimated on
the calibration sample of 1,580 customers. A challenge would be to infer the
coefficients for the rest of the firm&rsquo;s customers.
</p>
<p>3 Note the authors use the hierarchical model to project profits for both their model and
the other models. The justification is that the hierarchical model predicted best, so
would make the most accurate projection.</p>

</p>
<p>28.3.5 Incorporating Customer and Firm Dynamic
Rationality (Gönül and Shi 1998)
</p>
<p>28.3.5.1 Response Model
</p>
<p>Many optimal contact models assume that the firm is forward looking, i.e.,
&ldquo;dynamically rational.&rdquo; However, there is growing evidence that customers
are also dynamically rational &ndash; they consider the impact of their current
purchase on future costs and benefits. For example, consumers have been
shown to take into account the likelihood of future promotions in deciding
whether to purchase in period t (Gönül and Srinivasan 1996; Sun et al. 2003).4
</p>
<p>Gönül and Shi&rsquo;s (1998) optimal contact model takes into account that both
the customer and the firm may be forward looking. The customer&rsquo;s utility
function is:
</p>
<p>uit = α+ βmmit + β1rrit + β2rr2it + β1ffit + β2ff
2
it + εit (28.19)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>uit = Utility for customer i of making a purchase in period t; = 0 if the
customer does not make a purchase.
</p>
<p>mit = 1 if customer i receives a catalog in period t; 0 if not.
rit = Recency, the number of periods since the last purchase.
fit = Frequency, the number of purchases made by the customer since the
</p>
<p>beginning of the data.
</p>
<p>Utility is considered quadratic functions of both recency and frequency for
flexibility.
</p>
<p>The customer is assumed to maximize his or her long-term utility of mak-
ing a purchase in period t, taking into account the future impact of a cur-
rent purchase on his or her recency and frequency variables. Recency and
frequency are the state variables in the customer&rsquo;s dynamic program, sum-
marized by Sit = {rit, fit}. Each period, the customer decides whether to
buy (dit = 1) or not buy (dit = 0) by considering the following:
</p>
<p>Vit(Sit) =
</p>
<p>{
uit + δcE[Vi,t+1(Si,t+1|dit = 1)] if dit = 1
0 + δcE[Vi,t+1(Si,t+1|dit = 0)] if dit = 0
</p>
<p>(28.20)
</p>
<p>Customers realize that purchasing or not purchasing changes recency and
frequency, and that will affect future utility depending on the parameter
values in Equation 28.19. Gönül and Shi (1998) estimate Equation 28.19 by
maximum likelihood (see also Keane and Wolpin 1994).
</p>
<p>4 Note that competitive economic models in the database marketing literatures have
considered the case that both firms and customers are forward looking. See Chapter 2
for discussion.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>764 28 Multiple Campaign Management
</p>
<p>Gönül and Shi (1998) find the dynamic model fits better than a static
model. This suggests customers consider the future when deciding whether
to buy now. The mail variable has a positive coefficient as expected. Both
recency and frequency have U-shaped impacts. The recency result means that
the customer is most likely to buy right after the previous purchase or after
a significant lapse of time. The frequency result implies that customers who
have bought the product very frequently or very infrequently have more need
for the product in the current period.
</p>
<p>Gönül and Shi&rsquo;s response model does not take into account wear-in, wear-
out, and forgetting. However, this could be done through lagged mailing
variables as in Gönül et al. (2000). The model includes a &ldquo;structural model&rdquo;
of acceleration in the sense that the customer will purchase earlier if he or
she realizes that this will increase his or her future utility. See Li et al. (2005)
for an extension of the Gönül and Shi model optimizing two elements of the
marketing mix (messages and price).
</p>
<p>28.3.5.2 Optimization Model
</p>
<p>The firm&rsquo;s problem is to decide whether to mail to a customer each period
depending on which state the customer is in. The current period profit for
the firm is:
</p>
<p>πit(Sit,mit) = R Probit(dit = 1|Sit,mit)&minus; cmit (28.21)
where:
</p>
<p>πit(Sit,mit) = Profit for customer i in period t, given the customer is in state
Sit and a decision to mail or not mail.
</p>
<p>mit = 1 if mail to customer i in period t; 0 otherwise.
R = Revenues from customer i if the customer purchases.
dit = 1 if customer purchases; 0 otherwise.
c = Cost to mail to customer i.
</p>
<p>The recency/frequency state (Sit) is the state variable for the dynamic pro-
gram. The firm decides on the mailing policy that maximizes long-term prof-
its:
</p>
<p>Pit(Sit) =
&infin;&sum;
j=t
</p>
<p>δj&minus;tf πit(Sit,m
&lowast;
it(Sit)) (28.22)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Pit(Sit) = Maximum expected profits to be gained through an optimal mail-
ing policy for customer i who starts period t in state Sit.
</p>
<p>By the principle of optimality, long-term profits equal the profits from max-
imizing current period profits plus the maximal profits to be earned from
period t+ 1 onward, i.e.,:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28.3 Optimal Contact Models 765
</p>
<p>Pit(Sit) = max {πit(Sit,mit) + Pit+1(Sit+1)}
= max
</p>
<p>mit
{πit(Sit,mit)+ δf [Probit(dit =1|Sit,mit)Pit+1(Sit+1|dit =1)
</p>
<p>+Probit(dit = 0|Sit,mit)Pit+1(Sit+1|dit = 0)]} (28.23)
Gönül and Shi (1998) calculate the steady state optimal mail decision us-
ing successive approximation (Ross 1983). The authors maximize the firm&rsquo;s
future profits taking into account the customer&rsquo;s forward looking response
to the mailing decision. They apply their model to a durable product. The
authors find that if recency is low, the firm does not mail, but if recency is
medium or high, the firm does mail. The reason for this is that if recency
is low, the customer is likely to buy anyway (recall the U-shaped finding for
recency) so mailing is unnecessary. If recency is medium, response probability
is low without a mailing so the mailing is needed. When recency is high, cus-
tomers are likely to buy on their own, but it pays to mail to these customers
anyway to make sure they purchase and push up frequency to a higher level
where the customer will buy on his/her own.
</p>
<p>Gönül and Shi (1998) calculate that profits using their model would have
been 16% higher than what the firm actually earned during the data period.
They also note that if one just considers the short term, the firm would prob-
ably not do any mailing. This is because the break-even incremental response
probability to justify a single period mailing is 9.37%, and the incremental
response probability from a mailing is typically less than that. However, from
a long-term perspective, a mailing in the current period boosts consumers to
profitable recency and frequency states.
</p>
<p>In summary, the Gönül and Shi approach embeds a dynamic rational cus-
tomer response model within a dynamic firm optimization. While no other
mail policy will increase firm profits, other mail policies might increase cus-
tomer utility. This is similar to a Stackelberg game where the leader is the
firm and the follower is the customer. The customer is assumed to know the
mailing schedule. Indeed, many customers probably do learn how often they
receive catalogs from a given company. However, it would be interesting to
include customer catalog mailing expectations in the model.
</p>
<p>28.3.6 Incorporating Inventory Management (Bitran
and Mondschein 1996)
</p>
<p>28.3.6.1 Response Model
</p>
<p>Bitran and Mondschein (1996) use an RFM model (Chapter 12) as follows:
</p>
<p>Si = Market segment or &ldquo;state&rdquo; i, defined by specific values of recency, fre-
quency, and monetary value.
</p>
<p>psi,sj,k = Probability that a customer moves from state Si to Sj when he or
she receives k mailings in a given time period.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>766 28 Multiple Campaign Management
</p>
<p>Recency is defined as the number of periods since the last purchase. Frequency
is defined as 1 if the customer has bought once and 2 if more than once.
Monetary value is defined as two values, $55 and $80. This makes for a total
of 7&times;2&times;2 = 28 RFM states. The authors estimate the response probabilities
using historical data available from the catalog company with whom they
applied their model.
</p>
<p>28.3.6.2 Optimization Model
</p>
<p>Bitran and Mondschein&rsquo;s (1996) optimization considers (1) how many cata-
logs to mail to house list and rental list customers each season, and (2) how
much the firm should invest in inventory, subject to a budget. The model
takes into account firm-level constraints; it does not &ldquo;simply&rdquo; optimize in-
dividual customers. The optimization is a stochastic dynamic program, but
because the model is at the firm level, the states are numerous and contin-
uous. They include the number of customers in each RFM state, plus the
budget available and inventory levels. The model is not easily solved because
of the &ldquo;curse of dimensionality&rdquo; &ndash; there are too many state variables and
each of them takes on too many values. That is, if there are 27 RFM states,
there are 27 number-of-customers variables plus a budget variable plus an
inventory variable, resulting in 29 continuous state variables. This compares
to just four states for the Ching et al. (2004) model.
</p>
<p>To simplify, the authors first calculate the number of catalogs to mail
to a customer to maximize lifetime value, assuming no budget restrictions or
inventory costs. Second, they calculate optimal inventory re-ordering to max-
imize one-period profit. Third, they incorporate their lifetime value and in-
ventory calculations to derive the optimal mailing policy across all customers.
The lifetime value optimization is:
</p>
<p>LF (si) = Max

<p>where:

LF (si) = Lifetime value of a customer in state si.
k = Number of catalogs mailed under optimal policy (this will differ for each
</p>
<p>si). K is the maximum number of catalogs to be mailed.
psisjk = Probability customer in state si migrates to state sj if mailed k
</p>
<p>catalogs.
β = Discount factor.
b̄sik = Current period profit if customer in state si mailed k catalogs.

</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>dsisj = Amount of money spent by customer who migrates from si to sj .
g = Cost of goods sold as percentage of revenue.
c1 = Cost of filling order.
ch = Cost of mailing to member of house list.
</p>
<p>The inventory optimization calculates the amount of inventory to order to
maximize one-period profit, assuming the firm enters period t with a certain
level of inventory. The authors find the optimal amount to invest in inventory
is:
</p>
<p>Zt = σta+ &micro;t &minus; It (28.26)
where:
</p>
<p>Zt = Amount to invest in inventory at the beginning of period t.
&micro;t = Expected demand during period t.
σt = Standard deviation of demand in period t.
It = Inventory value at beginning of period t.
a = Solution to the following equation:
</p>
<p>Fy(a) =
1 + c2 &minus; g
</p>
<p>1 + c2 + c3 &minus; βg (28.27)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Fy(a) = The cumulative standard normal distribution.
c2 = Penalty cost for unfulfilled demand.
c3 = Inventory holding cost.
</p>
<p>From Equation 28.26, it follows immediately that the amount to order is in-
creasing in average demand and decreasing in inventory. From Equation 28.27,
it can be shown that the firm should order more if the penalty costs for un-
fulfilled demand are higher, less if it costs more to hold inventory, and order
less if COGS is high.
</p>
<p>Note that the inventory investment depends on demand, which depends
on the mailing policy and response. Likewise, the amount spent on inventory
influences the number of mailings because it limits cash availability. Bitran
and Mondschein make a major contribution by combining marketing and
operations decisions. The optimal firm-level mailing policy is derived by the
following linear program:
</p>
<p>max

</p>
<p>&sum;

</p>
<p>LF (sik)d(si, k) +

<p>d(si, k) &le; Nsit &forall;si (28.29b)
</p>
<p>d(j) &le; Ljt &forall;j (28.29c)
where:
</p>
<p>LF (sik) = Lifetime value of customer in state si assuming mail k catalogs
in current time period, and the optimal number thereafter according to
Equation 28.24. j refers to customers on rental list j.
</p>
<p>d(si, k) = Number of customers in RFM state si who receive k catalogs in
current period.
</p>
<p>d(j) = Number of catalogs mailed to rental list j in current time period.
Yt = Available funds after mailing and inventory investment.
at = Exogenously provided funding from corporate level in time t.
Nsit = Number of customers in state si in period t.
Ljt = Number of customers available from rental list j in period t.
</p>
<p>The decision variables are d(si, k) and d(j). The first constraint says that the
firm cannot spend more on mailings than available funds. Equations 28.29b&ndash;c
ensure that the total number of customers who receive catalogs does not ex-
ceed the sum of individuals who are in each RFM group or on each rental list.
</p>
<p>The authors implement the optimization by calculating the optimal mail-
ing plan via Equations 28.28&ndash;28.29, calculating the optimal re-order implied
by that plan (via Equation 28.26), then checking to make sure the re-order
plus mailing costs are within the cash constraint. If not, the lowest lifetime
value segment (determined by Equation 28.24) is dropped. The process iter-
ates until the cash constraint is satisfied.
</p>
<p>The authors apply their model using data from a catalog company, and
compare simulated profits generated from their method to a theoretical up-
per bound. They find their method does well compared to the upper bound,
usually capturing more than 95% of the upper bound profits. The authors
generate several insights based on their simulations. For example, when con-
strained by cash availability, it is better mail to more customers than mail
more often to a smaller set of customers. This is to prevent the not-mailed-to
customer&rsquo;s recency from becoming so high that they effectively exit the house
list. Also, start-up catalogs should use multiple mailings early to build up fre-
quency so that the customer becomes firmly entrenched in the house list. This
is the intuitive notion that new companies should emphasize acquisition over
retention (see Chapter 26).

<p>customers annually. The problem is to generate a set of catalogs (a &ldquo;mail
stream&rdquo;) to send to each customer over the planning horizon. Catalogs differ
in terms of their content and when they are to be sent. The method con-
sists of two steps, &ldquo;Clustering&rdquo; and &ldquo;Optimization,&rdquo; as shown in Fig. 28.8.
The Clustering phase measures response, while the Optimization phase de-
termines which mail stream to send to which cluster.
</p>
<p>The Clustering phase first produces 100 micro classes homogeneous with
respect to customer value, lifetime duration, and catalog productivity. This
is used to set mailing budgets per class. A second stage produces 20 clusters
within each micro class that are homogeneous with respect to predicted re-
sponse to the catalogs under consideration. Mail streams are then tailored to
each of the resulting 2,000 (100&times; 20) clusters.
</p>
<p>28.3.7.2 Optimization Model

</p>
<p>Xip = 1 if mail catalog p to customer i; 0 otherwise.
Sp,p&prime; = Saturative effect between catalogs p and p&prime; (Sect. 28.2.2)
B = Mailing budget constraint.
</p>
<p>The saturative effects provide interesting dynamics. However, the authors
cannot maximize the above because there are 7,000,000 customers times 40
potential catalogs, or 280,000,000 decision variables. That is simply too large
to solve directly.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, Campbell et al. simplify by dividing customers into the 2,000
clusters described above. They then conduct the optimization in two steps.
First they generate 10 candidate mail streams for each cluster. Next they
decide which mail streams to use for each cluster. The individual cluster
optimization is virtually the same as Equations 28.30a&ndash;b, and is described by
Campbell et al. (2001) as follows:
</p>
<p>MAX Z =
&sum;
p
</p>
<p>[Rp &minus; Ep]Yp &minus;
&sum;
p
</p>
<p>&sum;
p&prime;
</p>
<p>RpSp,p&prime;YpYp&prime; (28.31a)
</p>
<p>such that :
&sum;
p
</p>
<p>EpYp &le; B (28.31b)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Rp = Gross profit from mailing catalog p to the cluster.
Ep = Cost to mail catalog p to the cluster.
Yp = 1 if mail catalog p to the cluster; 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>The difference between Equations 28.31a&ndash;b and Equations 28.30a&ndash;b is drop-
ping the i subscript for individuals. Optimization 28.31a&ndash;b is solved for 2,000
different customer clusters. For each optimization, there are 40 decision vari-
ables corresponding to 40 catalogs, and a budget constraint. The optimization
is solved using a range of 10 values for the budget constraint, so 10 candidate
mail streams are generated for each cluster.
</p>
<p>A crucial output from this stage is the expected profit per customer for
mailing mail stream m to cluster j within micro-class k, Gkjm . This quan-
tity drives the objective function for the global optimization that maximizes
profits across clusters:

</p>
<p>The decision variable is the number of customers within a given cluster who
receive a particular mail stream. There are 20,000 decision variables since
there are 2,000 clusters and 10 potential mail streams per cluster. Equa-
tions 28.33a&ndash;d represent 2,141 constraints. The first (Equation 28.33a) is that
each catalog has an upper and lower bound for the total number of mailings.
These cover catalog development costs and maintain firm positioning. There
are 40 such constraints, one for each catalog.
</p>
<p>The second constraint (Equation 28.33b) is that each of the 100 micro-
classes has a minimum and maximum level of catalog mailing investment.
There are 100 such constraints. The bounds are generated in the first phase
of the system. This ensures that customer segments receive minimum levels of
investment while avoiding wear-out. The third constraint (Equation 28.33c)
is that all customers in each cluster must receive a mail stream. There are
thus 2,000 such constraints. The final constraint (Equation 28.33d) requires
that the total mailing investment must be between upper and lower bounds.
</p>
<p>In summary, Campbell et al. (2001) replace an optimization over
280,000,000 decision variables with one constraint by two optimizations &ndash;
one with 40 decision variables and one constraint that is solved 2,000 times,
and another that has 20,000 decision variables and 2,140 constraints.
</p>
<p>Campbell et al. (2001) report a field test consisting of 700,000 test and
700,000 control customers. The goal was to see if the system could gener-
ate incremental profit by lowering mailing costs. Indeed, the system reduced
mailing costs by 6%, and as a result, revenues fell by 1.5%. However, the net
impact was a profit gain of 2%. The effects were particularly strong for cus-
tomers who had not bought recently from Fingerhut. Campbell et al. (2001)</p>

</p>
<p>report that the system is &ldquo;directly responsible for a $3.5 million annual profit
gain,&rdquo; and that the &ldquo;project paid for itself within the first year&rdquo; (p. 86).
</p>
<p>The system is very innovative in its use of saturation interactions
(Sect. 28.2.2). The formation of clusters assumes customers within cluster
have homogeneous response to mail streams, but the clustering is based not
on response to mail streams, but to individual catalogs and aggregate mea-
sures of mailing response. On the optimization side, it is not clear how much
is lost by optimizing in two stages rather than one. In conclusion, Campbell
et al&rsquo;s (2001) method is innovative in its response function, practical in its
optimization, has demonstrated value in the real world, and provides ample
opportunities for future research.
</p>
<p>28.3.8 Multiple Catalog Mailings (Elsner
et al. 2003, 2004)
</p>
<p>28.3.8.1 Response Model
</p>
<p>Elsner et al. (2003, 2004) develop a &ldquo;dynamic multilevel model&rdquo; (DMLM)
for optimizing the targeting of a single catalog, and a &ldquo;dynamic multi-
dimensional model&rdquo; (DMDM) to target different catalogs. We focus on the
DMLM model and then discuss how it is extended to DMDM. DMLM con-
sists of three steps or levels, each of which requires its own response function
analysis:
</p>
<p>1. Determine how many catalog campaigns to conduct during the next 12
months, what should be the timing between campaigns, and on what day
to mail the catalogs for a given campaign. Let nopt be the optimal number
of campaigns.
</p>
<p>2. Determine which customer segments should receive the nopt campaigns.
3. Conduct an additional segmentation analysis that determines which cus-
</p>
<p>tomers are &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; and hence should receive a &ldquo;reactivation package&rdquo;
and which if any should receive the normal catalog mailing
</p>
<p>In the first step, the authors conduct field tests that provide data for regres-
sions that relate response rates and order sizes to the number of catalogs
distributed, the day of which customers received catalogs, and the time be-
tween mailings. An interesting finding is that Saturday is the optimal day
to deliver a catalog. This makes sense in that Saturday begins the weekend,
when customers have more time to read through catalogs.
</p>
<p>In Step 2, the authors divide customers into three segments based on
recency. They then estimate the response rate for each segment per catalog.
The authors assume that for a given segment, the response rates do not
change from campaign to campaign. They can then forecast how customers
will migrate between recency segments, similar to Bitran and Mondschein</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28.3 Optimal Contact Models 773
</p>
<p>(1996). They then calculate profits if a segment participates in nopt campaigns
and hence whether it is profitable receive nopt campaigns. An important
output of this step is a breakeven cut-off s&lowast;. If a given segment&rsquo;s expected
sales rate is less then s&lowast;, that segment does not receive the nopt campaigns.
</p>
<p>Step 3 looks at a complete array of RFM and other variables and deter-
mines whether a customer segment will achieve the critical breakeven point
or not. If not, further analysis is conducted to determine if it is worthwhile
to send the customers in that segment a special &ldquo;reactivation&rdquo; package.
</p>
<p>Note that the authors assume in step 2 that response rates for a given
segment are constant over time and do not depend on the frequency or timing
of catalogs. It thus appears that this model does not take into account wear-
in, wear-out, and forgetting. However, as in the Rust and Verhoef (2005)
model, step 1 implicitly does, since it regresses at an aggregate level total
response and order size as a function of frequency and timing.
</p>
<p>28.3.8.2 Optimization Model
</p>
<p>They authors find in Step 1 that 25 bimonthly catalog campaigns, spaced
14 days apart, and delivered on Saturdays is optimal (Elsner et al. 2003;
Fig. 28.4). The authors then divide their customer base into three recency
segments (e.g., recency &lt; 12 months, 12 &lt; recency &lt; 24, and recency &gt; 24).
Given the response rate and order size for each segment, as determined in
Step 2, they derive expressions for the expected number of customers in each
segment and hence its profitability, if that segment receives nopt catalogs.
They take into account that customers may be acquired or leave the database
entirely by moving without a forwarding address, etc. In summary, these
expressions calculate the total profit as a function of the customer migrations
that occur between recency states depending on whether a customer receives
and responds to a given catalog. Using these expressions, they calculate s&lowast;.
If a given segment j&rsquo;s sj = response rate&times; order size is greater than s&lowast;, the
segment receives the nopt catalogs.
</p>
<p>Step 3 provides a predictive model that identifies more specifically (on the
basis of more than just recency variables) which customers will have sj &lt; s&lowast;.
For those customers, the authors conduct additional analysis, scrutinizing
their response rates, etc., to determine if it is worthwhile to send them a
&ldquo;reactivation package.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The authors apply their procedure to a German catalog company,
Rhenania, and report improvements in sales and the size of the customer
base. Profit starts increasing a year later. The company does so well that
they acquire another catalog company, Akzente, and apply the model to
that company. Similar to the results for Rhenania, the number of active
customers, sales growth, and even profit immediately start to increase after
2&ndash;3 years of decline.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>774 28 Multiple Campaign Management
</p>
<p>The authors attribute the success to: (1) a forward-looking optimization
rather than optimizing one mailing at a time; (2) the use of segmentation
to help decide what minimum number of expected sales was required in or-
der to mail to the segment, and (3) further segmentation to identify active
versus inactive customers, and using a reactivation campaign selectively on
customers considered most likely to respond profitably.
</p>
<p>The authors found that after acquiring additional direct mail companies,
a new model was needed, DMDM, to optimize customer contacts across three
different types of catalogs. The authors follow generally the same three steps
as in DMLM, however, for example in Step 1, they also consider response to
the total number of mailings, across the three catalogs. Implicitly included is
the cross-correlation between response to catalogs for the different brands. In
applying this model (Elsner et al. 2004), they find for example there is more
cross-buying of products from different catalogs.
</p>
<p>28.3.9 Increasing Response to Online Panel
Surveys (Neslin et al. 2007)
</p>
<p>28.3.9.1 Response Model
</p>
<p>Neslin et al. (2007) develop a model to increase response rates for online
survey panels. Online survey panels have become an important source of
survey data. Nearly 80% of consumer goods and 74% of B2B companies
use online panels (Thornton 2005). Online panels provide fast turnaround,
lower operations costs (compared to mail surveys or personal interviews), and
more specialized sample frames. To increase response rates, the online panel
manager might increase participation incentives or recruit more panelists.
Either way this increases costs. Another alternative is to use an optimal
contact model. This identifies panelists who are likely to respond and uses
them judiciously over time to maximize response rates.
</p>
<p>Neslin et al. use a decision tree to model response to previous survey
solicitations. They consider several potential predictors; their final model
contains the following four:
</p>
<p>&bull; Days between the previous invitation or joining the panel and the cur-
rent invitation (INVJOIN): Lower INVJOIN was associated with higher
response.
</p>
<p>&bull; E-mail response confirmation (CONFIRM): The firm had sent an e-mail to
panelists asking whether they were still interested in participating. Possible
responses were &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No response.&rdquo; Those who said yes were
most likely to respond to mailings, while those who said no were unlikely
to response. No-response customers fell in the middle.
</p>
<p>&bull; Response to previous invitation (PREVRESP): Respondents might have
responded to the previous invitation, not responded, or never been invited</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>28.3 Optimal Contact Models 775
</p>
<p>before. Responders were obviously more likely to respond to subsequent
invitations, non-responders were least likely, and never-invited were in the
middle.
</p>
<p>&bull; Gender: Females were somewhat more likely to respond than males.
</p>
<p>The decision tree includes two variables that change over time, INVJOIN
and PREVRESP. The authors found no evidence of wear-out. This may be
due to the range of the data. Very few panelists in the data had been invited
to more than two studies.
</p>
<p>As in Simester et al. (2006), the decision tree end nodes divide customers
into states. Customers migrate from state to state. For example, if the cut-
off for being in the low INVJOIN state is 61 days, then after 61 days, the
customer migrates to the INVJOIN &gt; 61 state, where response rates are
generally lower. Similarly, since PREVRESP is a predictor, panelists migrate
to different states depending on whether they respond to a given invitation.
This customer migration plays a critical role in the optimization, as it does
for several of the other models reviewed in this chapter.
</p>
<p>28.3.9.2 Optimization Model
</p>
<p>The optimization model is forward looking over a finite horizon the authors
chose to be the next four studies. The decision is how many customers in
state j to invite to participate in a given study. The optimization takes into
account that new panelists may be added to the database over time. It also
takes into account that given studies may require demographic balance, for
example, an equal number of males and females.
</p>
<p>Specifically, the authors formulate their optimization as a linear program:
</p>
<p>Minimize
Xjs
</p>
<p>S&sum;
s=1
</p>
<p>N&sum;
j=1
</p>
<p>Xjs (28.34)
</p>
<p>subject to:
</p>
<p>Xjs &le; Ajs j = 1, . . . , N ; s = 1, . . . , S (28.35a)&sum;
j&isin;Mg
</p>
<p>rjXjt &ge; Qsg g = 1, . . . , G; s = 1, . . . , S (28.35b)
</p>
<p>Aks =
N&sum;
j=1
</p>
<p>pjk Xj,s&minus;1 +
N&sum;
j=1
</p>
<p>qjk(Aj,s&minus;1 &minus;Xj,s&minus;1)
</p>
<p>+Rks k = 1, . . . , N ; s = 2, . . . , S (28.35c)
</p>
<p>where:
</p>
<p>Xjs = Number of panelists in state j invited to participate in study s.
Ajs = Number of panelists in state j available to participate in study s.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>776 28 Multiple Campaign Management
</p>
<p>rj = Response rate for panelists in state j.
Qsg = Number of respondents desired from demographic group g for study
</p>
<p>s.
psj = Probability panelist in state j migrates to state k if invited to partici-
</p>
<p>pate in a given study.
qjk = Probability panelist in state j migrates to state k if invited to partici-
</p>
<p>pate in a given study.
Rks = Number of newly recruited panelists joining state k in time for study
</p>
<p>s.
</p>
<p>The objective is to minimize the number of invites over the horizon. Since
the model includes constraints on the desired number of respondents for each
study, this is equivalent to maximizing average response rate. Constraint
28.32a ensures the solution can not invite more panelists from a given state
to participate in a given study than are available. Constraint 28.32b states
the required number of respondents from each demographic group; Mg is the
set of states that contain panelists from demographic group g. Constraint
28.32c keeps track of panelists available for each state, for each study. The
number of panelists in state k equals the number of responding panelists who
migrate to state k plus the number of non-responding panelists who migrate
to state k, plus the number of newly recruited panelists who enter state k.
The migration is governed by the migration probabilities p and q. These in
turn are derived by the definition of states as determined by the end nodes
of the decision tree, and to the schedule of studies.
</p>
<p>The authors use a rolling horizon implementation. Rolling horizons are
used frequently in operations management (Baker 1977; Chand et al. 2002)
as a pragmatic way to implement models when uncertainty is involved. In the
authors&rsquo; context, the approach is: (1) Find the optimal solution for Studies 1,
2, 3, and 4. This solution is based on expected panelist migration calculated
using Equation 28.35c. (2) Implement the solution for Study 1. (3) Observe
who actually responds or does not, thus calculating the actual numbers of
customers in each state as of Study 2. (4) Find the optimal solution for
Studies 2, 3, 4, and 5. (5) Implement the solution for Study 2, etc.
</p>
<p>The authors field test the model and compare it to random selection and
the firm&rsquo;s current heuristic for selecting panelists. Figure 28.9 shows the model
outperforms both alternatives. The reason the optimization distinguishes
itself particularly for the last three studies is that for the first study, there
were not many panelists available in what the predictive model identified as
high-responding states. However, in the first study, the model solicits pan-
elists to discern whether they were in the high-responding group or not. For
example customers with low INVJOIN and PREVRESP = &ldquo;respond&rdquo; are
high response panelists. However, there were not any of these available for
Study 1. By inviting high INVJOIN previous responders, the model could
create a pool of low INVJOIN previous responders for Study 2 who would be
highly likely to respond to that study. This strategy evidently worked well.</p>

(From Neslin et al. 2007).
</p>
<p>28.4 Summary
</p>
<p>Table 28.4 summarizes the various features contained in the optimal contact
models discussed in this section. All but one of the models is applied to direct
mailings or promotions. Neslin et al. (2007) show that the method is more
broadly applicable (see also Sun and Li 2005, Chapter 25, for an application to
call centers). Other potential applications include e-mails, online advertising,
and multi-channel promotions. Most of the methods focus on one type of
communication, e.g., a single catalog, rather than a selection of catalogs.
Campbell et al. (2001), Rust and Verhoef (2005) and the extension of the basic
model in Elsner et al. (2003, 2004) are important exceptions. Considering a
selection of communications raises the issue of communication overlap, which
Campbell et al. model in an innovative way.
</p>
<p>Optimization methods range from simple profit cut-offs (Gönül et al.
2000) and linear programs (Neslin et al. 2007) to multi-stage optimizations
(Campbell et al. 2001; Elsner et al. 2003, 2004). In both these multi-stage
optimizations, the first consideration is the schedule of catalogs, while the
second is which customer segment should receive which schedule. This ap-
proach may be a necessary simplification when there are different types of
communications under consideration.
</p>
<p>Most of the models assume the firm is forward looking. Rust and Verhoef
(2005) are one exception. They focus on the aggregate level of marketing effort
to expend on each customer within a year, without worrying about several
years or the schedule within a year. The detailed scheduling of marketing
effort is what creates a complex dynamic optimization. It would be very</p>

<p>interesting to compare the aggregate approach with an ad hoc scheduling rule
to a true dynamic optimization.
</p>
<p>Gönül and Shi (1998) are unique in allowing the customer also to be for-
ward looking. Gönül and Shi are also unique in considering potential endo-
geneity of the mailing decision in the data they use to estimate the predictive
model. That they do not find this to be an issue is re-assuring, but there is
need to investigate this more fully (see Ansari et al. 2008).
</p>
<p>Most of the models devise a steady state decision rule, as in &ldquo;if the cus-
tomer is in this RFM state at time t, mail a catalog to the consumer&rdquo; (e.g.,
Simester et al. 2006). One exception is Neslin et al. (2007), who use a rolling
schedule approach so there is no general decision rule.
</p>
<p>Bitran and Mondschein (1996) are unique in their treatment of a broader
class of decisions, particularly dealing with the operations side of the business.
They consider &ldquo;back door&rdquo; inventory and ordering costs, which are vital to
a catalog organization.
</p>
<p>The methods also use a variety of response models, including RFM, haz-
ard models, and decision trees. The RFM and decision tree models divide
customers into segments; membership in these segments changes over time,
allowing for dynamics in the optimization. Another important, practical as-
pect considered by Bitran and Mondschein (1996), Campbell et al. (2001),
and Elsner et al. (2003, 2004) is to consider both whether the customer re-
sponds, and if so, how much does the customer spend. Finally, a key issue
uncovered by Simester et al. (2006) is that it is important that the data used
to estimate the response functions represent a broad range of mailing his-
tories. The point is very important. Optimization models do not explicitly
consider the quality of the data that drive them. Simester et al. point out
that in practice, ample data variation is crucial.
</p>
<p>A final note is that while the collection of models summarized in this
chapter collectively show that optimal contact models can be constructed
and implemented, more work is needed to demonstrate they improve over
current practice or simpler models (e.g., myopic models as mentioned above)
in actual field tests. Campbell et al. (2001) and Neslin et al. (2007) demon-
strate successes in controlled field tests, Elsner et al. (2003, 2004) provide
quasi-experimental evidence of success, and Simester et al. 2006) demonstrate
mixed results. More field testing is needed. Given the complexity of customer-
specific multi-campaign scheduling, it is crucial to understand where the sim-
plifications can be made, and which issues need to be confronted head on
without any simplification.</p>

<p>Chapter 29
</p>
<p>Pricing
</p>
<p>Abstract The database marketing environment presents many challenges
involving pricing. How should we coordinate acquisition pricing and retention
pricing? How should we price when we want to re-activate customers? How
should we use database marketing to price discriminate? This chapter reviews
models and methods for providing insights on these questions. We point out
that pricing cannot be considered in a vacuum; for example, that customer
quality expectations play a key role in acquisition pricing.
</p>
<p>Pricing is a critical area in customer management. There is a vast litera-
ture, primarily in economics, about pricing products and services. Yet, very
little has been written about pricing over the lifetime of customers. This
chapter will examine basic pricing theories that have applicability to pric-
ing for individual customers over time as well as offering different customers
different prices (price discrimination). A major theme is our emphasis on
customer-based as opposed to product-based pricing. Customer-based pric-
ing maximizes total customer profitability, across the several products the
customer might buy, whereas product-based pricing takes the vantage point
of maximizing profits for a given product. Customer-based pricing is partic-
ularly appropriate for database marketing where the focus is on managing
customers.
</p>
<p>29.1 Overview &ndash; Customer-based Pricing
</p>
<p>Most firms price products individually. Product pricing optimizes the price of
a given product/service without regard to optimizing the pricing of the total
bundle of products/services the customer purchases over his or her lifetime.
</p>
<p>Suppose a customer is more likely to buy a second product if the customer
already purchased another product from the firm. Then, the firm must jointly
optimize the profits based on the profitability of the two products, not each
separately. An example is a financial service firm selling mortgages. Assume
</p>
<p>781</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>782 29 Pricing
</p>
<p>that the customer is more likely to purchase a mortgage if the customer
has previously purchased a fee-based credit card. Hence the pricing of the
fee-based credit card should reflect the purchase of future products.
</p>
<p>Mathematically, we can set up the problem as a two-stage optimization in
which the first purchase affects the probability of a second purchase. Later
in the chapter we will study this structure for customer-based pricing. A
related but more complex issue, not addressed currently in the marketing
literature, is if the firm has two products and each could be purchased as
the lead product (first product purchased), what is the optimal product-line
pricing? Intuitively, both products should be priced lower.
</p>
<p>Most of the marketing literature on acquisition pricing focuses on the
pricing of durable goods with learning on the cost side and diffusion on the
demand side. The issue this literature addresses is how should the firm price
a new durable good overtime? Each customer is &ldquo;acquired&rdquo; because there
is no repeat purchasing. Also, the prices for the &ldquo;early adopters&rdquo; affect the
future price of the product through the cost side.
</p>
<p>If the firm does not have repeat purchasing, then one commonly used so-
lution to acquisition pricing is skim pricing &ndash; pricing high at first and then
lower overtime. This is covered extensively in the literature beginning with
Robinson and Lakhani (1975) and continuing to Nair (2007). Skim pricing
is driven, in part, due to experience curves, if the firm has a monopoly po-
sition and customers exhibit innovator/adopter behavior. If marginal costs
decline as a function of cumulative volume, then, ceteris paribus, the firm
should &ldquo;skim&rdquo; price. If consumer tastes are different (heterogeneous) and the
monopolist firm can price differentially over time, then, ceteris paribus the
firm can execute a skim pricing strategy. If the discount rate for product con-
sumption is high, then, ceteris paribus, the firm should skim price. However,
if the customer is willing to wait, and the firm has a high discount rate, it
may be better to price uniformly overtime or lower price. Lazear (1986) de-
scribed how it is optimal to price high at the beginning of the fashion season
to attract price insensitive fashion-forward consumers and then lower prices
overtime to price discriminate to reach the more price sensitive customers.
</p>
<p>Kalish (1983) examined different diffusion model assumptions. For the con-
sumer side of the model he uses a Bass curve and for the cost side he assumes
there is learning through producing. Kalish&rsquo;s key finding is that depending
upon different assumptions, different price paths are possible. Production
learning curves result in marginal costs declining over time, which always
causes prices to decline. Diffusion works in the other direction causing the
firm to price low to increase the number of innovators who in turn increase
the number of adopters. Because diffusion and production learning curves
are working in the opposite direction, the price path can decrease or increase
depending upon the relative importance of the diffusion process relative to
learning curves.
</p>
<p>Numerous other articles have been written about Bass model pricing (see
Bass 2004). We will not use these models in this chapter because they focus</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>29.2 Customer Pricing when Customers Can Purchase Multiple One-Time Products 783
</p>
<p>on diffusion behavior of customers. We will not assume any diffusion effects in
the customer-based pricing models we will consider. Researchers may see an
opportunity to incorporate diffusion in the types of customer-based pricing
we will study but to do so, it would be necessary to show that there is diffu-
sion for standard products/services that are already in the market place. We
will briefly mention acquisition learning curves because many dot.com firms
believed that as more customers were acquired, the cost of acquisition would
decline because the firm would learn how to be more efficient in customer
acquisition. However, while acquisition learning cost reductions probably ex-
ist, the dot-coms were overly optimistic. There is no documented literature
showing the magnitude of these effects.
</p>
<p>The remainder of this chapter will focus on customer-based pricing. The
objective will be to maximize the long-term profitability of the customer. The
reason is that customers are assets (see Blattberg et al. 2001), not simply
transactions, and profit maximization must be over their long-term purchase
behavior. Customer-based pricing can be broken into three components: ac-
quisition, retention and &ldquo;add-on selling&rdquo; pricing. In this chapter we will focus
on all three. The reason one needs to separate acquisition from retention pric-
ing is that the price that a customer is acquired influences retention rates.
Therefore, the prices are not independent. This will be discussed in detail later
in the chapter. Also, because the customer&rsquo;s behavior is dynamic (changes
over time), it is necessary to make certain assumptions about the customer&rsquo;s
price sensitivity over time.
</p>
<p>When one considers customer-based pricing, there are two different di-
rections to take: (1) pricing products/services that are &ldquo;one-shot&rdquo; purchases
but the customer purchases multiple products from the firm (e.g., electronics
from Sony) and (2) pricing a repeat purchase product in which the customer
purchases the same product/service multiple times. We will consider both
cases in this chapter.
</p>
<p>This chapter will be organized with Sect. 29.2 addressing customer-based
pricing when customers purchase multiple one-time products from the firm;
Sect. 29.3 studies pricing products/services to customers over two periods;
Sect. 29.4 utilizes the customer equity model to determine acquisition and
retention prices; Sect. 29.5 studies pricing to recapture customers; Sect. 29.6
addresses pricing of add-on sales; and Sect. 29.7 covers the use of price dis-
crimination and how to value the information the firm has available to price
differentially.
</p>
<p>29.2 Customer Pricing when Customers Can Purchase
Multiple One-Time Products from the Firm
</p>
<p>Database marketers often are able to offer a &ldquo;lead&rdquo; product to acquire a cus-
tomer. Examples include checking accounts for financial services companies,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>784 29 Pricing
</p>
<p>low-cost low-featured automobiles (e.g., Mercedes 1 series) for car companies,
or accessories for clothing retailers. Pricing lead products is tricky because if
the price is too low and repeat purchasing through other product lines is low,
then the firm loses money. On the other hand, if its pricing is too high and the
product quality is high, the firm may under-invest in customer acquisition.
</p>
<p>In the model provided in this section, we will not assume the firm is price
discriminating. While this is often discussed in the marketing and database
marketing literature, it may be more difficult to execute in practice. Later
in the chapter in the section titled Price Discrimination through Targeting
Models, we cover an article by Feinberg et al. (2002) which shows some of the
problems with trying to price discriminate when customers can learn about
other customers&rsquo; prices. The relevance of this section to database marketers is
that it teaches the firm how to price &ldquo;lead&rdquo; products for customer acquisition.
Database marketers have a major advantage in using these methods, because
through their databases, they can learn which are the &ldquo;lead&rdquo; or first products
a customer purchases.
</p>
<p>We will begin by assuming there is a relationship between the purchase of
several products because once the customer purchases one of the firm&rsquo;s prod-
ucts/services, the customer is more likely to purchase another. The products
do not have to be complements. The pricing strategy and pricing levels are
different than if the customer just purchased one product. For example, Dell
historically sold computers but now sells printers and flat screen televisions.
After purchasing one of Dell&rsquo;s products, its quality influences the probability
of purchasing another from Dell. This should affect Dell&rsquo;s pricing of products
that customers tend to acquire on their first purchase occasion. Dell, through
its databases, can learn which are the first products customers purchase, and
then consider how best to price those products recognizing their pricing af-
fects the number of customers Dell acquires. Another example is a financial
service firms that uses mortgages as its lead product and then sells traditional
banking products such as checking and deposit products as second and third
products.
</p>
<p>When the products are not complements but the customer purchases mul-
tiple products from some firm, we will call these brand-linked purchases. Why
is there a link? Customers learn about the brand&rsquo;s quality through the use
of the first product. Customers have higher awareness of the brand after the
initial purchase. Customers receive targeted communications from the firm.
Because of the link, the firm should use customer-based pricing, not product-
based pricing.
</p>
<p>As a first example of customer-based lead product pricing, we will use a
model adapted from Shapiro (1983). We will consider two products (1, 2).
The firm has already set the price of product 2. The issue is: how should it
price product 1 given that the probability the customer purchases product 2
depends upon the purchase and quality of product 1?
</p>
<p>We will use an example to help make this section concrete. Suppose a firm
sells two products. Product 2 is a flat screen TV, product 1 is a computer.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>29.2 Customer Pricing when Customers Can Purchase Multiple One-Time Products 785
</p>
<p>The firm sets the price of the flat screen television at $2,000 and makes a
margin 20% or $400. The question is how to price the computer. The firm&rsquo;s
cost is $2,000. Since both products are made by the same firm, the customer
estimates the quality of the flat screen television based on the quality of the
computer. Both have the same brand name.
</p>
<p>The key to this analysis is to price product 1 taking into account that after
purchasing that product, the customer will revise his or her quality estimate
of product 2. The assumption to be used in the model is that customers revise
their quality estimate upward, although one could investigate the other case
as well.
</p>
<p>We will make the following assumptions. The firm is a monopolist who
chooses product quality, qi, for product i, which is given and not subject
to change. We will use a constant cost (ci) for the ith product. Consumers
are indexed by their taste for quality for product i, θi, which represents the
dollar value consumer of type θi places on product i&rsquo;s quality, qi. Note that
in different product categories customers may have a different preference for
quality. θi is bounded between 0 and 1. θi is basically the importance of
quality to the customer. A consumer of type θi who pays pi for the product
of quality qi enjoys consumer surplus of θiqi &minus; pi for i = 1, 2.
</p>
<p>Consumers have an expectation about the quality of the seller&rsquo;s products,
Ri &gt; 0(i = 1, 2). Ri is a point expectation (not a distribution). The value
of Ri is based on the firm&rsquo;s reputation. It does not depend upon marketing
activities but could easily be related to advertising and positioning decisions
by the firm.
</p>
<p>A consumer of type θi will purchase initially if and only if θiRi &gt; pi which
implies θi &gt; pi/Ri. Consumer diversity is captured through the distribution
of θi across customers, denoted by f(θi). Then the fraction of consumers with
taste parameter greater than θi is:
</p>
<p>1&minus; F (θi) =
&int; 1
θi
</p>
<p>f(t)dt
</p>
<p>with
</p>
<p>F (θi) =
&int; θi
0
</p>
<p>f(t)dt
</p>
<p>(29.1)
</p>
<p>Demand for the initial product is given by:
</p>
<p>s(p1) = 1&minus; F (p1/R1) (29.2)
As R1 increases, demand increases and as p1 increases, demand decreases.
Thus, initially, if the firm could control R1, it would try to set it as high as
possible.
</p>
<p>We will continue with our example. Suppose we assume the value of R1
is 5,000 and θ1 follows a uniform distribution. The firm sets a price for its
computers of $3,000. Then, the fraction of customers who will purchase the
product is those for whom θ1 &gt; p1/R1 = 1 &minus; (3, 000/5, 000) = 0.4. Suppose</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>786 29 Pricing
</p>
<p>the price were raised to $4,000. Then the fraction of customers purchasing
the product is s(4, 000/5, 000) = (1&minus; F (.8)) = (1&minus; 0.8) = 0.2.
</p>
<p>We will consider two cases. Case 1: The consumer only purchases product
1. Case 2: The consumer purchases product 1 and then based on the purchase
of product 1, updates the expected quality of product 2 to q2 from R2. The
price of product 2, p2, is set. The estimate of the quality of product 1 is
R1 and is less than the true quality q1. However, after using product 1, the
consumer updates his or her estimate of quality from R2 to q2.
</p>
<p>29.2.1 Case 1: Only Product 1 Is Purchased
</p>
<p>The customer has a purchase probability for product 1 of
</p>
<p>Prob(Purchase Product1) = 1&minus; F
(
p1
R1
</p>
<p>)
(29.3)
</p>
<p>and the profit function is:
</p>
<p>π1 = N
[
1&minus; F
</p>
<p>(
p1
R1
</p>
<p>)]
(p1 &minus; c1) (29.4)
</p>
<p>where N is the size of the market. We will assume a uniform distribution for
θ1. Then, F ( p1R1 ) =
</p>
<p>p1
R1
</p>
<p>.
Differentiating with respect to p1 and setting the derivative equal to zero
</p>
<p>gives:

<p>R1
= 0 or
</p>
<p>p1 =
R1 + c1
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>(29.5)
</p>
<p>The above is based on a uniform distribution, which is tractable and shows
the results clearly. Shapiro (1983) shows more general results than we show
here.
</p>
<p>Continuing with our example, let c1 = $2, 000 and remembering that R1 =
5, 000, we have p1 = (5, 000+2, 000)/2 = $3, 500. We will contrast this result
to the two product purchase case.
</p>
<p>29.2.2 Case 2: Two Product Purchase Model with
Lead Product 1
</p>
<p>In Case 2 we assume the customer purchases a second product based on his
or her experience with product 1. After purchasing product 1, the customer</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>29.2 Customer Pricing when Customers Can Purchase Multiple One-Time Products 787
</p>
<p>updates his or her expectations about the quality of the firm&rsquo;s brand and
expected quality goes from R2 to q2 where q2 &gt; R2. One could also assume
R2 &gt; q2 and analyze that case. However, we will analyze the case in which
consumers&rsquo; expectations are below the true quality for product 2 and the
consumer uses product 1 to update their expectations about the true quality
of product 2, q2.
</p>
<p>The probability of purchasing is 1 &minus; F ( piRi ) for both products. Then the
number of customers purchasing over both periods is:
</p>
<p>S = N
{[
</p>
<p>1&minus; F
(
p1
R1
</p>
<p>)]
+
[
1&minus; F
</p>
<p>(
p2
q2
</p>
<p>)]}
(29.6)
</p>
<p>The q2 in the second part of the equation is due to the assumption that the
customer learns the true quality of product 2 after the initial purchase of
product 1. Profit, π, is:
</p>
<p>π = N
[
1&minus; F
</p>
<p>(
p1
R1
</p>
<p>)]
&times;
{
(p1 &minus; c1) +
</p>
<p>[
1&minus; F
</p>
<p>(
p2
q2
</p>
<p>)]
&times; (p2 &minus; c2)]
</p>
<p>}
(29.7)
</p>
<p>Let [1&minus; F (p2q2 )]&times; (p2 &minus; c2)] = k. Again, assuming a uniform distribution for
θ1, we can optimize with respect to p1, assuming p2 is given. The optimal
price is
</p>
<p>p1 =
R1 + (c1 &minus; k)
</p>
<p>2
(29.8)
</p>
<p>Because k &gt; 0, the optimal price to charge for product 1 is lowered based on
the additional profit to be made on product 2.
</p>
<p>Continuing with our example, let c2 = $1, 000, p2 = $1, 500 and q2 =
3, 000. Then, using Equations 29.7 and 29.8 above, we have k = (1 &minus;
F (1, 500/3, 000)) &times; (1, 500 &minus; 1, 000) = 250. Next we substitute k into Equa-
tion 29.8 and we have p1 = (5, 000 + (2, 000&minus; 250))/2 = $3, 375.
</p>
<p>The result from the two product case shows that the profit from future
purchases enters into the pricing of the first product and lowers the price
when the true quality is higher than the expected quality. Thus, the firm
induces more customers to sample product 1 because of its lower price which
then impacts the purchase level of product 2 because the customers update
their expectations about the quality of product 2. If customers do not use
product 1 to update their expectations about the quality of product 2, then
the firm should use the myopic price (Equation 29.5).
</p>
<p>Obviously there are many issues associated with this model and example:
</p>
<p>1. Why is the mean expectation for product 2 different than the true quality?
When this is true, rational expectations assumptions are violated but in
the real-world firms may know their product quality is greater than con-
sumers&rsquo; perceptions (through marketing research) and can influence future
purchasing by using lower prices for the lead product.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>788 29 Pricing
</p>
<p>2. How can a firm estimate the difference between expected quality for prod-
uct 2 (R2) and actual quality for product 2 (q2)? This is marketing research
question and can be determined by using research to ascertain the actual
quality versus consumer expectations of quality. The other related issue is
that once a consumer samples product 1, the firm can determine if that
consumer updates his or her estimate of product 2.
</p>
<p>3. Why is this example relevant to database marketing? Database mar-
keters have the capability to determine which are lead products (prod-
uct purchased first by customers) and can also develop targeted programs
for selling the second product. Traditional marketers may also be able
to use this type of pricing when products are introduced sequentially
but database marketers can use their data to determine which prod-
ucts naturally are the lead products ever if both products are in the
market.
</p>
<p>The conclusions from analyzing these two cases are:
</p>
<p>&bull; Even if the lead product is a low-priced product, the firm should be
very careful about its product quality because lead product quality im-
pacts pricing and profits from future products its customers purchase
firm.
</p>
<p>&bull; Firms need to develop mechanisms for estimating lead products and un-
derstanding how their quality levels match future products purchased by
the customers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Firms should develop pricing policies based on the quality of its products
and the purchase sequence used by customers.
</p>
<p>29.3 Pricing the Same Products/Services to
Customers over Two Periods
</p>
<p>We now consider the case where the same product may be purchased over
time, but customers do not know initial quality. The question is: should a
database marketing company use a higher (lower) introductory price to ac-
quire customers and then lower (raise) its price after acquiring the customer?
</p>
<p>We use the same &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; as in Sect. 29.2. Customers are indexed
by their taste for quality, θ, which represents the dollar value consumers of
type θ places of the product of quality q. θ is bounded between 0 and 1. A
consumer of type θ who pays p for a product of quality q enjoys consumer
surplus of θq&minus;p. Consumers have an expected quality of the seller&rsquo;s product,
R &gt; 0. R is a point expectation. The value of R is based on the firm&rsquo;s
reputation.
</p>
<p>A consumer of type θ will purchase initially if and only if θR &gt; p which
implies θ &gt; p/R. Consumer diversity is captured through the distribution
of θ which is denoted by f(θ). Then the number of consumers with taste</p>
<p/>

<p>29.3 Pricing the Same Products/Services to Customers over Two Periods 789

<p>parameter greater than θ is:
</p>
<p>1&minus; F (θ) =
&int; 1
θ
</p>
<p>f(t)dt

<p>or
</p>
<p>F (θ) = 1&minus;
&int; 1
θ
</p>
<p>f(t)dt
</p>
<p>(29.9)
</p>
<p>Initial demand is given by:
</p>
<p>s(p) = 1&minus; F (p/R) (29.10)
As R increases, demand increases. Thus, initially, if the firm could control
R, it would try to set it as high as possible. However, in future periods, all
consumers who learn the true quality and for whom R is greater than q, will
stop buying.
</p>
<p>Demand for the product if the quality were known (fully informed con-
sumers) would be:
</p>
<p>s(p) = 1&minus; F (p/q). (29.11)
where q is substituted for R because the consumer knows the true quality. We
will assume that learning occurs through personal experience and is complete
and immediate.
</p>
<p>29.3.1 Pessimistic Case: R &lt; q &ndash; Expectations of
Quality are Less than Actual Quality
</p>
<p>The pessimistic case assumes customers have initial expectations about qual-
ity (R) below the true quality level (q). The customer, after trying the prod-
uct/service learns the true quality is q. We will assume that the firm sets
the introductory price (p1) to attract customers and sets the future price for
subsequent purchases (p2).1 We will assume a two-period model. The first-
period profit function is π1 = 1 &minus; F (p1R ) &times; (p1 &minus; c). Customers who try the
product/service learn the true quality q. The two-period profit function is
</p>
<p>π =
[
1&minus; F
</p>
<p>(p1
R
</p>
<p>)]
(p1 &minus; c) +
</p>
<p>[
1&minus; F
</p>
<p>(p1
R
</p>
<p>)]
(p2 &minus; c) (29.12)
</p>
<p>The number of acquired customers is 1&minus;F (p1R ). All of the customers who pur-
chased in the first period will be willing to continue purchasing if p2/q &lt; θ.
The condition for these customers to purchase in the first period was
p1/R &lt; θ. Therefore all customers will be retained if p1/R = p2/q. Since
q &gt; R, we can make p2 &gt; p1. Hence, because the true quality is higher than
the estimated quality, the firm will raise its price in period 2.

as in Sect. 29.2.</p>

</p>
<p>To determine the optimal introductory price, the firm optimizes Equa-
tion 29.12 with respect to p1 with p2 = p1(q/R). It can be shown that the
optimal first period price is:
</p>
<p>p1 =
R
</p>
<p>2
+
</p>
<p>c
</p>
<p>1 + q/R
(29.13)
</p>
<p>To the extent that expected quality underestimates true quality (q &gt; R),
we price lower in period 1 but then adjust upwards in period 2. We can
contrast this with the myopic solution (one-period) which is p1 = (c+ R)/2
(Equation 29.5). Table 29.1 shows some results for various values of q, R and
c. The two-period model chooses a lower initial than second-period price, and
the myopic price is between these two.
</p>
<p>The pricing model offered by Shapiro can be expanded to include other
assumptions. For example, one can add retention to the model and discount
future sales quite easily. The optimal first-period price will depend upon the
level of future profits. The higher the future profits, the lower will be the
price in the first period.
</p>
<p>29.3.2 Optimistic Case: R &gt; q &ndash; Expectations of
Quality are Greater than Actual Quality
</p>
<p>When customers under estimate the true quality (pessimistic case), price
should be low in the introductory period and higher in future periods. The
opposite occurs when customer expectations are higher than the true qual-
ity. In this case the optimal pricing path is to charge a higher price in the
introductory period and skim off those customers who incorrectly perceive
quality. Then the price is reduced in the second period after the customer
observes the true quality.
</p>
<p>29.3.3 Research Issues
</p>
<p>The work of Shapiro provides a wide variety of research questions. First, if
the same price has to be offered to existing and new customers, the pricing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>29.4 Acquisition and Retention Pricing Using the Customer Equity Model 791
</p>
<p>decision becomes more complex. Database marketing potentially solves this
problem because it can offer different prices to different customers. Non-
database marketers have significantly greater difficulty price discriminating
between new and existing purchasers.
</p>
<p>Second, what is the impact of competition on the pricing strategy? The
problem with incorporating competition is that most models assume it is a
duopoly. However, in the real-world there are often many competitors and
the firm is differentiated. Then, what is the impact of competition? This
raises the question if it is better to assume a monopolistic model and derive
the relevant pricing strategies or use a duopolist model with its attendant
limitations.
</p>
<p>A third issue for many database marketing firms is that there are many
prices to be set, not just one. This is similar to a retailer&rsquo;s pricing problem.
How does the firm develop a customer pricing strategy when it has multiple
products being sold to a new customer?
</p>
<p>A fourth issue is learning. When customers purchase a new product or
service, they often are learning about the firm. Further, the firm is learning
about the customer. Some papers in the economic literature on new prod-
uct pricing assume the firm and/or the customer learn. Initially, the papers
studied monopolistic behavior but recently have studied duopolistic behavior.
See, for example, Bergemann and Valimaki (1997, 2000).
</p>
<p>29.4 Acquisition and Retention Pricing Using the
Customer Equity Model
</p>
<p>An alternative approach to customer-based pricing is to use a customer equity
model (e.g., Blattberg et al. 2001) and optimize it with respect to both ac-
quisition and retention pricing. The Blattberg et al. (BGT) model is divided
into acquisition and retention. Nt customers are available to be acquired and
Ntαt are actually acquired. Then, in the first period ρt+1 customers are re-
tained; in period 2 ρt+1 &times; ρt+2 customers are retained and so on. The basic
model is:
</p>
<p>CE(t) = {(Pa,t &minus; Ca,t)&times;Ntαt &minus;NtBa,t}+
&infin;&sum;
k=1
</p>
<p>[{
(Pr,t+k &minus; Cr,t+k)
</p>

}(
</p>
<p>1
1 + d
</p>
<p>)k ]
(29.14)
</p>
<p>where
</p>
<p>rkt+k =
k&prod;
</p>
<p>i=1
</p>
<p>ρt+i</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>792 29 Pricing
</p>
<p>and
</p>
<p>CE(t) = Customer equity for customers acquired at time t.
Pa,t = Introductory price offered at time t.
Pr,t = Retention price offered at time t.
Ca,t = Average product cost in the acquisition period per customer at time
</p>
<p>t.
Cr,t = Average product costs in the retention period per customer at time t.
αt = The acquisition rate at time t.
ρt = The retention rate at time t.
rkt+k = The survival rate at time t+ k.
Ba,t = The acquisition marketing expenditures per prospect at time t.
Br,t = Retention marketing expenditures per existing customer at time t.
d = Discount factor
Nt = Number of prospects at time t.
</p>
<p>The survival rate in the second term of Equation 29.14 (rkt+k&minus;1) is lagged one
period because the retention marketing expenditures are assumed to occur at
the beginning of the period. We will assume that ρt+k = ρt for all k, meaning
a constant retention rate. We also will assume that the retention period price
(Pr,t+k) and cost (Cr,t+k) are constant over time. These assumptions make
the derivations tractable.
</p>
<p>Pricing enters the equation through several variables in the model: acqui-
sition and retention rates, and sales for acquisition and retention. Thus, in
developing &ldquo;optimal pricing,&rdquo; it is critical to understand the impact of price
on each of these factors.

</p>
<p>Solving Equation 29.17 for Pa reveals that the optimal acquisition price does
depend upon the firm&rsquo;s retention tactics (i.e., retention price and marketing
expenditures) and profitability. Specifically2:
</p>
<p>Pa =
EαPa

EαPa =
</p>
<p>&part;α(Pa)
&part;Pa
</p>
<p>&times; Paα(Pa) = Price elasticity of the acquisition probability.
Equation 29.19 suggests two insights concerning optimal introductory pricing:
</p>
<p>&bull; As future profits, represented by φθ, become higher, the optimal acquisi-
tion price decreases.
</p>
<p>&bull; As future profits, represented by φθ approach zero, the optimal acquisition
price increases towards the myopic price.
</p>
<p>Thus customers who become more profitable over time (e.g., customers who
purchase add-ons, become less costly to serve, have a strong positive influence
on other customers, or have higher retention rates) should be offered a lower
</p>
<p>2 In a monopoly in which the firm is maximizing current period profits (i.e., behaving

<p>introductory price than customers who are not as profitable in future periods.
Therefore the firm should price discriminate based on the future value of
a customer. This result suggests that an optimal acquisition pricing policy
should be based on expected future profits because myopic pricing may not
generate the optimal number of customers.3
</p>
<p>Implicitly solving for the optimal retention price from the differential in
Equation 29.18 is more difficult. Unlike the optimal acquisition price, the
optimal retention price can not be isolated on one side of the equation and
must be written as a function of the other retention parameters. The optimal
retention price can be studied only through numerical examples.
</p>
<p>We use a numerical example that depends upon the choice of the retention
price model. Assume:
</p>
<p>ρ(Pr) =
e&minus;λP
</p>
<p>γ
r
</p>
<p>2(1 + e&minus;λP
γ
r )
</p>
<p>(29.20)
</p>
<p>λ was varied over three values and then an optimization routine was run
to find the optimal retention price. The results are given in Table 29.2. It
shows that as λ increases, making the retention rate more price sensitive, the
optimal retention price decreases. The difficult practical issue is being able
to determine the model&rsquo;s parameters. Field testing could provide data points
to estimate the model.
</p>
<p>29.5 Pricing to Recapture Customers
</p>
<p>A related problem to acquisition and retention pricing is pricing to recapture
customers. Alternative theories exist. One implies that pricing to recapture
customers is based on the previous price paid, which becomes the reference
price. Another states that increasing price generates a &ldquo;loss&rdquo; and reducing
</p>
<p>3 In some industries (e.g. telecommunications), this is called &ldquo;sling-shot pricing.&rdquo; Firms
price low to acquire customers, losing significant money in the first period, and then
make profits through high retention rates. It is called &ldquo;sling-shot pricing&rdquo; because profits
explode in later periods.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>29.5 Pricing to Recapture Customers 795
</p>
<p>price is a &ldquo;gain&rdquo;; hence there should be asymmetry in response. The simplest
hypothesis is that there is no connection between prices and reacquisition
prices.
</p>
<p>Thomas et al. (2004a) investigate various hypotheses about what affects
pricing when recapturing customers. The methodology used is a split hazard
model. The process begins when the customer is reacquired by the firm and
ends when the customer terminates the subsequent relationship. A split haz-
ard formulation is comprised of separate reacquisition and duration compo-
nents. The reacquisition component measures the probability of recapturing
a lapsed customer while the duration component predicts the length of the
second tenure given the customer has been successfully recaptured.
</p>
<p>For customer i (i = 1 . . . C) the reacquisition component is specified as a
binomial probit with observation equation:
</p>
<p>Zi =
</p>
<p>{
1 if Z&lowast;i &gt; 0
0 otherwise
</p>
<p>(29.21)
</p>
<p>The latent dependent variable zi&lowast; is modeled
</p>
<p>zi&lowast; = wig + ni (29.22)
</p>
<p>where wig is the deterministic component and ni is the stochastic component;
wi is the customer&rsquo;s vector of predictors and g is the associated parameter
vector.
</p>
<p>Modeling of the second tenure is complicated by the firm&rsquo;s propensity to
change the offer price during the relationship. Each consumer&rsquo;s second tenure
consists of one or more subspells that differ only in the offer price. Assuming
the termination of the relationship is independent of the current duration
allows the authors to assume the duration of a subspell does not depend on
the length of prior subspells. For some observations, the customer has not
terminated and hence tenure is right-censored.
</p>
<p>The model is as follows:
</p>
<p>yisi =
</p>
<p>{
y&lowast;isi if yisi &lt; cisi
cisi otherwise
</p>
<p>(29.23)
</p>
<p>yisi is the observed duration of the relationship and cisi is the censoring value,
the length that a price is offered. If the customer terminates the relationship
before the price changes, then yisi = y
</p>
<p>&lowast;
isi
</p>
<p>. Otherwise the duration of the
subspell is right censored. Latent duration y&lowast;isi is modeled as:
</p>
<p>ln(y&lowast;isi) = Xisiβ + εisi (29.24)
</p>
<p>where Xisiβ is the deterministic component, εisi is the stochastic compo-
nent; Xisi is the customers&rsquo; vector of predictors during subspell si, and β
is the parameter vector. Variance components are used to link acquisition
and retention behavior. Customer heterogeneity is also modeled. See Thomas
et al. for the specific variance structure and Chib (1993) for the estimation
method.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>796 29 Pricing
</p>
<p>The conclusions from Thomas et al. are:
</p>
<p>1. Customers are more likely to be reacquired if the reacquisition price is
lower.
</p>
<p>2. The absolute effect of price is much more important than the effect of
price relative to the last price paid in the prior relationship. Reacquisition
strategies emphasizing decreasing price relative to the prior relationship
are not likely to be effective. The most effective method for winning back
lapsed customers is to offer a lower price. Also, customers who were ac-
quired with low prices will not be enticed with significantly lower prices
(in other words, relative price is not the critical factor).
</p>
<p>3. Price increases have no effect on second tenure duration and price decreases
relative to the prior price leads to a longer second tenure.
</p>
<p>4. Higher retention prices lead to longer relationship duration. This result is
different from Reinartz (2000) finding that long-life customers pay lower
average prices than short-life customers. An alternative explanation is
heterogeneity in reservation prices (similar to the model used by Shapiro
1983). Basically, usage allows the customer to tell true quality, which then
implies a willingness to pay higher prices. Thus, the customer will pay a
higher price when the customer recognizes the quality is superior through
usage.
</p>
<p>29.6 Pricing Add-on Sales
</p>
<p>The Customer Equity model given in Equation 29.14 will be the basis for a
discussion of pricing add-on sales with an additional variable added to the
model.

</p>

</p>
<p>Note that Xk depends upon the price of add-on sales but as importantly,
the retention rate, ρ, depends upon the number of add-on purchases the cus-
tomer makes. The model assumes that the greater the number of purchases</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>29.7 Price Discrimination Through Database Targeting Models 797
</p>
<p>made, the higher the retention rate. This is consistent with RFM models. In
the banking industry it is believed that if the firm can sell multiple products to
the customer (e.g., a mortgage, checking and savings account), the customer
has more difficulty changing relationships and therefore there is greater reten-
tion. The problem is distinguishing the number of purchases (relationships)
from customer heterogeneity. Many studies show that the more purchases
from the firm, the greater the probability of buying. However, is this due to
consumer preference for the firm&rsquo;s products and satisfaction with the firm or
is it due to the number of purchases the customer makes?
</p>
<p>The implications of these two possibilities are quite different. If it is the
number of purchases that increases retention, then the optimal price to charge
for &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; selling will be lower. If the cause of the higher retention rates
being correlated with the number of purchases is heterogeneity in preference
and satisfaction, then the firm should not lower prices when selling additional
products/services.
</p>
<p>While pricing add-on sales is a critical customer-based pricing issue, there
is very little literature on the topic. One research paper that investigates
a related issue is Israel (2005), who examined the relationship between re-
cency and retention rate. Through the clever use of an automobile insurance
database, Israel (2005) was able to investigate whether retention rates were
affected by recency or due to unobserved heterogeneity in customer prefer-
ences. Using the auto insurance data he found evidence for both effects but
concluded that the role of unobserved heterogeneity was much more impor-
tant. A recent study by Reinartz et al. (2006) uses Granger causality tests
to investigate whether cross-buying determines loyalty or loyalty determines
cross-buying. For two firms, they conclude that loyalty causes cross-buying.
If the findings from the Israel and Reinartz et al. studies were generalized,
one would conclude that many of the recommendations that the number of
products is a very good predictor of retention rates might in fact simply be
related to consumer preference for the service. This is a crucial area for future
research, and see Chapter21 for further discussion.
</p>
<p>29.7 Price Discrimination Through Database
Targeting Models
</p>
<p>There is a vast literature in marketing and economics on price discriminating
among customers. We will review several articles including one of the seminal
articles on this topic by Rossi et al. (1996).
</p>
<p>Any basic micro economics textbook discusses the conditions under which
a firm can price discriminate. We will focus on how does database marketing
help a firm price discriminate and can customer databases always be used to
price discriminate?
</p>
<p>We begin with an article by Rossi et al. (1996) which addresses the issue
of the value of purchase history data for targeting. They compare the use of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>798 29 Pricing
</p>
<p>demographic data, which many marketing firms believe should serve as the
basis for selecting market segments, and purchase history data.
</p>
<p>The basic proposition of Rossi et al. is that information sets are used to
draw inferences about household preferences and household-specific parame-
ters such as price sensitivity measures. These household-specific preferences
and price elasticities can be used to target promotions and prices at the
individual level.
</p>
<p>Rossi et al. compare decisions with information from the household with
decisions in which there is no relevant information (causal or demographic
information). The value of the information is determined by assessing how
much the firm&rsquo;s profit increases when it uses the specific types of information
versus when it does not.
</p>
<p>The authors conclude that demographic data explains very little of the
variation in price sensitivity (only 7%). Their results are consistent with other
studies that find demographic information explain even less of the variability
(Bucklin and Gupta (1992) and Gupta and Chintagunta (1994)). This finding
is consistent with predictive models that often find demographic data have
limited value in targeting. Of course, this will vary by product category and
there may be instances in which demographic data could provide insights into
price sensitivity (e.g., expensive durable goods).
</p>
<p>The other conclusion Rossi et al. draw is that purchase histories have
significant value even if the purchase histories are short. This is reassuring
because many database marketers have limited causal data (promotional his-
tories) captured in their databases.
</p>
<p>The most important contribution of Rossi et al. is providing a method-
ology for determining the value of information to a database marketer. The
methodology can be applied to situations in which the firm wants to deter-
mine the value of keeping its promotional histories for targeting. Do long
purchase history data or solicitation data provide enough value to justify the
cost of keeping the data?
</p>
<p>An article by Zhang and Krishnamurthi (2004) considers the issues of when
to offer promotions and how much to discount to individual customers. They
use a purchase incidence, purchase timing, brand choice model which allows
for inertia/variety seeking behavior and consumer heterogeneity to address
these questions. Their major modeling contribution is that their model can
continuously update the model&rsquo;s parameters by individual and then deter-
mine the optimal timing of promotions. Using their model they then evaluate
different promotional strategies. Their finding is that by varying the timing of
promotions based on continuously updating the model, profits can increase.
</p>
<p>One issue Zhang and Krishnamurthi raise is consumers anticipating pro-
motions (consumer expectations). Others such as Erdem et al. (2003) and
Hendel and Nevo (2002) have developed models that include consumers&rsquo; ex-
pectations about prices. This is a critical issue and was discussed earlier in this
chapter. If consumers anticipate price changes, then the models need to be
altered to take into account how changes in promotional or price strategies</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>29.7 Price Discrimination Through Database Targeting Models 799
</p>
<p>lead to changes in consumers&rsquo; expectations which then change consumers&rsquo;
purchase patterns. This phenomenon is well understood for durable goods
(particularly electronics and computers) where consumers know that prices
will drop in the future. For database marketers, as pricing strategies become
dynamic, consumer expectations may also be dynamic and understanding the
implications of having both changing at once becomes an important modeling
challenge. Research has just scratched the surface of this issue.
</p>
<p>In another paper, Zhang and Wedel (2007) ask the question about what
level of personalized promotions work in different environments. They con-
sider two types of retailers &ndash; bricks and mortar (offline) and online &ndash; and three
levels of promotions &ndash; mass market, segment level and individual-level. They
build a similar model to that of Zhang and Krishnamurthi which includes a
purchase incidence, choice and quantity model and allows for heterogeneity.
</p>
<p>One interesting finding by Zhang and Wedel (2007) is that the gains in
profits from mass market to segment to individual-level optimization are not
that large, especially in off-line environments, while there is a substantial gain
in moving from current managerial practice to mass market optimization.
This is a provocative result. One factor driving their results is the retailer&rsquo;s
cost structure. For offline retailers the ability to reach its customers through
mass-communications may be more cost-effective than it is for online retailers
because they have the store environment to communicate promotions, which
is very low cost. Also, the cost of offering promotions through tools such
as Catalina Marketing Systems is low for offline retailers. Hence the gains
from personalization are offset by the low delivery costs. Another factor is
that both offline and online retailers have data on their customer&rsquo;s behavior
with their business, but not with competitors. This might add significant
measurement error to individual-level and even segment-level price elasticity
estimates (see Park and Fader 2004).
</p>
<p>Zhang and Wedel do indicate that individual level databases do have the
potential to provide significant economic returns in the correct environment.
However, for a database marketer when the costs of mass promotions are very
low, the payouts from having an extensive customer database may also be
very low. This is exemplified by the struggles offline grocery retailers world-
wide are having with the use of their customer databases. With the exception
of a few retailers such as Tesco (UK) or CVS (USA), very few have been able
to generate a significant payout from frequent shopper programs. This may
be caused by the fact that mass promotions are more cost effective.
</p>
<p>One final issue associated with price discrimination is do consumers/
customers care if others are receiving a lower price than they do? Feinberg et
al. (2002) address this issue using laboratory experiments. Their basic premise
is that consumer preference for a firm&rsquo;s products is affected not just by the
price the consumer pays but the prices that other consumers are paying.
</p>
<p>To test this premise, they design a series of laboratory experiments in
combination with various models to answer the question above. They find two
effects beyond traditional economic rationality: (1) consumers feel betrayed</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>800 29 Pricing
</p>
<p>if their favored firm offers promotions to switchers; and (2) consumers are
jealous if another firm offers a price decrease to its own loyal customers and
the favored firm does not.
</p>
<p>These findings are in a laboratory setting in which the authors can manip-
ulate the information each consumer receives. In the real-world, it is not clear
how much of this information is available to customers. However, regarding
finding one above, consumers can often tell if a firm is offering lower prices
to new customers. Mobile phone firms offer lower prices to new customers;
credit card companies offer low teaser rates to prospective new customers.
This type of offer may lead to a sense of betrayal and therefore affect the
ability of the firm to offer low prices to new customers and then raise their
prices over time. The findings of Feinberg et al. are provocative and should
lead to additional research, particularly understanding in the real-world the
prevalence of consumers&rsquo; knowledge about what others pay and what their
reaction is to that information (see Krishna et al. (2004) for an interesting
follow-up paper on whether betrayal and jealousy effects exist when firms
target price increases selectively).</p>
