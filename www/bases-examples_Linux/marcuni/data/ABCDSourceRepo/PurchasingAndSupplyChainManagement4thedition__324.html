core tasks and challenges required to effectively manage the purchasing function within
the context of an integrated supply chain. Although prior editions have dealt with many
components of obtaining goods and services, we have created an integrated text that
helps managers develop purchasing and supply chain strategies that contribute to overall
business objectives. This new edition includes a number of innovative subjects that have
been developed as a result of recent research projects undertaken by the authors.
</p>
<p>Some of the subjects that are newly introduced or expanded upon in this edition
include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Cross-functional teaming

<p>The text is appropriate for either an elective or a required course that fulfills the
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) requirements for cov-
erage of materials management issues. Most of the cases included in the book are
based on actual companies and have all been used and modified through classroom
use by the authors.
</p>
<p>Course Objectives
Depending on the placement of a course in the curriculum or the individual in-
</p>
<p>structor&rsquo;s philosophy, this book can be used to satisfy a variety of objectives:
</p>
<p>1. Students should be made aware of the demands placed on purchasing and sup-
ply chain managers by business stakeholders.
</p>
<p>2. As prospective managers, students need to understand the impact of purchas-
ing and supply chain management on the competitive success and profitability
of modern organizations.
</p>
<p>3. Students should appreciate the ethical, contractual, and legal issues faced by
purchasing and supply chain professionals.
</p>
<p>4. Students must understand the increasingly strategic nature of purchasing, espe-
cially the fact that purchasing is much more than simply buying goods and
services.
</p>
<p>5. Students entering or currently in the workforce must understand the influence
of purchasing on other major functional activities, including product design,
information system design, e-commerce, manufacturing planning and control,
inventory management, human resource development, financial planning,
forecasting, sales, quality management, as well as many other areas.
</p>
<p>Unique to This Edition
Many of the insights and topics presented throughout this book are based on exam-
</p>
<p>ples developed through discussions with top purchasing executives and from various
research initiatives, including research published by CAPS Research, work at the
North Carolina State University Supply Chain Resource Consortium, and a project on
supplier integration funded by the National Science Foundation. In addition, the text
has a chapter format that includes an opening vignette, a set of sourcing snapshots,
and a concluding good practice example that illustrates and integrates each chapter&rsquo;s
topics. These new case studies and examples provide up-to-date illustrations of the
concepts presented throughout each chapter.
</p>
<p>The concept of teaming is emphasized throughout this book. Many of the case ex-
ercises require a team effort on the part of students. We recommend that the instruc-
tor have students work in teams for such projects to prepare them for the team envi-
ronment found in most organizations.
</p>
<p>Structure of the Book
This book is subdivided into six parts and 20 chapters that provide thorough cover-
</p>
<p>age of purchasing and supply chain management.S

<p>xxiv Preface</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Part 1: Introduction
Chapter 1 introduces the reader to purchasing and supply chain management. This
</p>
<p>chapter defines procurement and sourcing, introduces the notion of the supply chain,
and summarizes the evolution of purchasing and supply chain management as an
organizational activity.
</p>
<p>Part 2: Purchasing Operations and Structure
The chapters in Part 2 provide an in-depth understanding of the fundamentals
</p>
<p>surrounding the operational activity called purchasing. These chapters focus primarily
on the fundamentals of purchasing as a functional activity. Without a solid under-
standing of purchasing basics, appreciating the important role that purchasing can
play becomes difficult.
</p>
<p>Chapter 2 provides an overview of the purchasing process by presenting the objec-
tives of world-class purchasing organizations, the responsibilities of professional pur-
chasers, the purchasing cycle, and various types of purchasing documents and types of
purchases. Chapter 3 examines various categories and types of purchasing policy and
procedure. Most firms have a set of policies outlining the directives of executive man-
agement. These directives guide behavior and decision making and place boundaries
on the behavior of personnel. Chapter 4 examines purchasing as a boundary-spanning
function. Much of what purchasing involves requires interacting and working with
other functional areas and suppliers. This chapter examines the intra-firm linkages be-
tween purchasing and other groups, including suppliers. Chapter 5 focuses on pur-
chasing and supply chain organization. This includes a discussion of purchasing in the
organizational hierarchy, how the purchasing function is organized, and the placement
of purchasing authority. The chapter also describes the team approach as part of the
organizational structure.
</p>
<p>Part 3: Strategic Sourcing
A major premise underlying this book is that purchasing is a critical process and
</p>
<p>makes as important a contribution as manufacturing, marketing, or engineering to the
pursuit of a firm&rsquo;s strategic objectives. Progressive firms have little doubt about pur-
chasing&rsquo;s impact on total quality, cost, delivery, technology, and responsiveness to the
needs of external customers. Part 3 addresses what firms must do to achieve a com-
petitive advantage from their procurement and sourcing processes. Realizing these ad-
vantages requires shifting our view of purchasing from a tactical or clerically oriented
activity to one focusing on strategic supply management. Strategic supply manage-
ment involves developing the strategies, approaches, and methods for realizing a com-
petitive advantage and improvement from the procurement and sourcing process,
particularly through direct involvement and interaction with suppliers.
</p>
<p>Chapter 6 develops an understanding of how firms set purchasing strategies. This
process should include a vision and plan of what a firm must do in its purchasing/
sourcing efforts to support achieving corporate goals and objectives. Clearly, the
strategic planning process should be the starting point for any discussion of strategic
supply management. Purchasing and commodity strategy development processes are
discussed. Chapter 7 focuses on one of the most important processes performed by
firms today&mdash;that is, supplier evaluation, selection, and measurement. Selecting the
right suppliers helps ensure that buyers receive the right inputs to satisfy their quality, S

<p>cost, delivery, and technology requirements. Selecting the right suppliers also creates
the foundation for working closely with suppliers, when required, to further improve
performance. Chapter 8 describes how a progressive firm manages and improves sup-
plier quality once it selects its suppliers. Improving supplier quality may also create
advantages that are not available to competing firms. Six Sigma applications are dis-
cussed. Chapter 9 describes what firms must do to manage and develop world-class
supply-base performance. Supplier development is a focus. Finally, Chapter 10 focuses
on worldwide sourcing, which is an important part of strategic supply management as
firms search worldwide for the best resources.
</p>
<p>Part 4: Strategic Sourcing Process
Chapter 11 focuses on strategic cost management and cost/price analysis. Progres-
</p>
<p>sive firms focus on cost control and reduction with suppliers as a way to improve (i.e.,
reduce) purchase price over time. Understanding cost fundamentals and appreciating
how and when to use advanced costing techniques is critical for purchasers. This
chapter details various types of costs, presents cost analysis techniques, and discusses
the factors that affect a supplier&rsquo;s price. The chapter also discusses total cost analysis,
cost-based pricing, and other innovative techniques designed to provide accurate and
timely cost data.
</p>
<p>Purchasing professionals rely on an assortment of tools, techniques, and ap-
proaches for managing the procurement and supply chain process. Chapter 12
presents various tools and techniques that purchasers use when problem solving and
pursuing performance improvements. The use of these tools and techniques can help
purchasers achieve specific outcomes such as reducing cost/price, improving quality,
reducing time, or improving delivery performance from suppliers.
</p>
<p>Chapter 13 deals with purchase negotiation. Effective purchasers know how to plan
for and negotiate contracts that create value within a buyer-seller relationship. Increas-
ingly, purchase contracts emphasize more than simply purchase price. Buyers and
sellers may negotiate cost reductions, delivery requirements, quality levels, payment
terms, or anything else important to the parties. Purchase negotiation will become
increasingly important as firms focus on non-price issues and longer-term, complex
purchase agreements.
</p>
<p>Chapter 14 addresses the fundamentals of contracting. The formal contracting
process creates the framework for conducting business between two or more firms. As
such, an understanding of contracting is essential when attempting to manage costs
within a buyer-seller relationship. Chapter 15 addresses the major legal considerations
in purchasing, including the legal authority of the purchasing manager. The chapter
also discusses sources of U.S. law, warranties, purchase order contracts, breaches of
contract, and patent and intellectual property rights. Because contracting is a part of
the legal process, this chapter naturally follows the contracting chapter.
</p>
<p>Part 5: Critical Supply Chain Elements
Part 5 describes the major activities that relate to or directly support supply chain
</p>
<p>management. Some of these activities involve specific disciplines, such as inventory
management or transportation; other activities relate to the development of supply
chain support systems. These systems include performance measurement systems and
computerized information technology systems. The activities presented in this part
may or may not be a formal part of the purchasing organization. These activities and
systems, however, are key elements of purchasing and supply chain management.

<p>Without them, purchasing probably cannot effectively pursue its goals and objectives.
Therefore, purchasing students must be familiar with a range of supply chain
activities.
</p>
<p>Chapter 16 focuses on a topic of increasing interest&mdash;the management of a firm&rsquo;s
inventory investment. The money that a firm commits to inventory usually involves a
significant commitment of financial resources. This chapter discusses the function of
inventory within a firm, factors leading to inventory waste, creating a lean supply
chain, approaches for managing a firm&rsquo;s inventory investment, and future trends
related to managing inventory. At some firms, purchasing is responsible for the day-
to-day management of inventory.
</p>
<p>Another area of interest involves the purchase of transportation and other services.
We have witnessed major changes in transportation over the last 15 years, many
of which have affected purchasing. Since Congress deregulated the transportation in-
dustry in the early 1980s, the role of the buyer has changed dramatically. More than
ever, purchasing is involving itself in the evaluation, selection, and management
of transportation carriers. Even if a buyer does not get involved directly with transpor-
tation, having a working knowledge of this dynamic area is critical. Chapter 17
highlights purchasing&rsquo;s role in transportation and service buying, presents a decision-
making framework for developing transportation strategy, discusses ways to control
and influence inbound transportation, and evaluates trends affecting the purchase of
transportation services such as performance-based logistics. In addition, insights into
how other services are purchased are discussed.
</p>
<p>Information technology systems are changing business. Purchasing, too, can benefit
from the development of current information technology systems. Chapter 18
examines the role of supply chain information systems and electronic commerce. The
chapter also addresses the electronic linkage between firms through electronic data
interchange (EDI) and Internet capability. Finally, this chapter discusses some ad-
vanced and future e-purchasing and supply systems&rsquo; applications. The availability of
information technology systems greatly enhances purchasing&rsquo;s ability to operate at the
highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness.
</p>
<p>Chapter 19 focuses on performance measurement and evaluation. Increasingly,
firms must develop valid measurement systems that reveal how well a firm is perform-
ing, including the performance of its purchasing and supply chain management
efforts. These systems need to be clearly linked to overall company objectives.
Measurement systems support procurement and sourcing decision making by provid-
ing accurate and timely performance data. This chapter examines why firms measure
performance, defines various purchasing performance measurement categories, and
discusses how to develop a purchasing performance measurement system, including a
balanced scorecard.
</p>
<p>Part 6: Future Directions
Chapter 20 focuses on what purchasing and supply chain management will look
</p>
<p>like in the 21st century. These trends, which are adapted directly from recent surveys
and studies of key executive managers from a variety of global organizations, can help
students identify how the field of purchasing and sourcing management is changing,
and what skills they will need to develop in view of these changes. The latest predic-
tions are included from CAPS Research Project 10X EA and a joint CAPS Research,
AT Kearney, and ISM study focused on supply strategies for the decade ahead.

<p>Putting the &ldquo;ROAR&rdquo; Back in CSX Purchasing
</p>
<p>Fran Chinnici, a Penn State University engineering graduate, knows all about the Nit-
tany Lion &ldquo;roar&rdquo; from his days in State College (a.k.a. Happy Valley). When Chinnici was
named vice president of purchasing and materials at CSX Transportation just over three
years ago, he felt that a major change was needed to get his sourcing team on a new track.
Since his appointment to the job, he has put the purchasing function on the global track to
21st-century excellence.
</p>
<p>CSX is one of four Class 1 Railroads in the United States. In 2007 the company had sales of
over $10 billion and earnings of $2.99/share. With a barrel of crude oil fluctuating in the
$90 to $100 range and fuel prices at close to $3 a gallon, the railroads have become a favor-
ite of many shippers. The railroads&rsquo; low cost-per-ton-mile allows them to compete very favor-
ably with other transportation modes.
</p>
<p>Supporting this business growth and sustaining high levels of service, while controlling mate-
rials costs, posed major challenges for the CSX Purchasing and Materials Department. Meet-
ing the challenge was compounded by a changing supply base. Chinnici states that &ldquo;a
reduction in the number of railroads and the subsequent consolidation of purchases resulted
in a downsizing of our domestic supply base.&rdquo; With the growth in shipments experienced by
the U.S. Class 1 Railroads, the lack of domestic suppliers is a major concern. This is espe-
cially true considering that Chinnici and his team are responsible for $4 billion in pur-
chases. This money is spent on over 100,000 items necessary to keep 21,000 route miles of
track, about 100,000 freight cars, and over 4,300 locomotives moving freight to the thou-
sands of localities and customers served by CSX. &ldquo;Based on the demands of our operating en-
vironment, the shrinking supply base, and the need to continuously add value to the
company from a supply perspective, it was a no-brainer that we had to develop a more
global perspective,&rdquo; says Chinnici.
</p>
<p>His goal was to raise the skill levels of his organization to meet the global as well as other
challenges required of a 21st-century supply function. Toward that end, he made it a require-
ment for all current employees and new hires to further develop their skill sets and attain
the status of Certified Purchasing Manager (C.P.M.). Leading by example, Chinnici attended
C.P.M. training along with his staff members and successfully passed the necessary exams.
He proudly displays his C.P.M. certificate in his office overlooking Jacksonville&rsquo;s growing sky-
line. &ldquo;Attending classes with my people was a way of visibly demonstrating my commitment
to raising our level of professionalism,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and the C.P.M. is just a start.&rdquo; After three
years he is proud to say that over 95% of his supply management professionals are C.P.M.
certified.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The journey from a domestic to a global supply base is not always smooth and it requires
both time and effort to make a significant impact,&rdquo; Chinnici states. Without adding head-
count, Chinnici reorganized his resources and formed a team focused on developing current
suppliers and growing the supply base. Led by Rod Keefe, the Purchasing Strategy and Sup-
plier Development team was formed to develop suppliers and create a process to begin sourc-
ing railroad materials globally. An early success was the sourcing of rail from Eastern
Europe. So now, in addition to two domestic rail mills and mills in Japan, CSX sources rail
from the Czech Republic. Then, 25-year purchasing veteran Jim Fronckoski, manager of Loco-
motive Purchasing, began scouring the globe for rail wheels, brake shoes, and coupler parts.
&ldquo;Many of the commodities in the marketplace where we play are becoming global,&rdquo; states
Fronckoski. So in order to move the skill set of his purchasing team to yet another level of pro-
fessionalism in global awareness, Chinnici had his key managers and staff attend a series

<p>of global sourcing workshops. &ldquo;The customized workshops provided my staff with a much
deeper understanding of global sourcing issues and required relationships,&rdquo; he states. To date,
the department has several global sourcing initiatives in the pipeline. Some are pending ap-
proval from the American Association of Railroads standards board; others require extensive
laboratory and field testing to ensure their integrity for service use.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t cut corners,&rdquo; says Chinnici. As evidence of that, the Penn State engineer recently
huddled resources from around CSX to expand the supplier quality efforts for purchased mate-
rials, and it&rsquo;s no surprise he gave them a global perspective on launch day. With the coopera-
tion and vision of Rich Regan, vice president of Mechanical Operations, Chinnici centralized
this technical group in Purchasing, added additional resources, and expanded the focus to in-
clude all critical materials from around the globe.
</p>
<p>Complementing the global push is CSX&rsquo;s extensive involvement in e-commerce. The railroads
have a long history of doing business electronically, beginning with their pioneering efforts in
using EDI with their customers. CSX continues the use of electronic tools to facilitate sourc-
ing. &ldquo;98.6% of our purchasing expenditures are now transmitted electronically,&rdquo; states Stan
Hefley, director of Process Improvement. Hefley further states, &ldquo;On an average month we run
about 2,000 items a day over our Oracle system.&rdquo; Another major e-commerce initiative is the
association with Railmarketplace.com, where the four major railroads meet to discuss poten-
tial purchases of nonstrategic items. Elaine Mosley, manager of Supplier Development, says,
&ldquo;The consortium gives CSX and the other major railroads an opportunity to leverage their
smaller nondirect purchases to provide savings for all the participants.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Putting the right structure in place to achieve these results is no easy task. &ldquo;I felt my direct
reporting staff was somewhat disjointed and hindered the ability to make rapid decisions,&rdquo;
states Chinnici. &ldquo;We needed to streamline our organization and become able to identify and
seize market opportunities quickly.&rdquo; Chinnici&rsquo;s vision is to have a lean, responsive supply man-
agement organization that anticipates and meets the needs of CSX. &ldquo;I want to be like Wal-
Mart . . . by having a quality product available, at a convenient place and at the right cost,
while working with both our suppliers and internal customers to provide a very high level of co-
operation and service.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Chinnici is pushing his procurement team to work at a much higher strategic level in the in-
dustry, providing even more value-added service to CSX. To that end the supply group is start-
ing to become a player in areas often described as nontraditional, because these areas of
spend were traditionally purchased by functional groups outside of purchasing. Becoming in-
volved in these new service areas, such as audit, legal, and advertising, allows the CSX sup-
ply function to apply professional supply management and contracting practices to areas
that were previously the domain of users in other functional areas. Chinnici sums it up by
stating that &ldquo;in today&rsquo;s rapidly changing environment we need skilled, open-minded supply
professionals who can deliver results to our organization regardless of economic conditions
and in any area of spend.&rdquo; Oscar Munoz, CSX executive vice president and chief financial offi-
cer, concurs. &ldquo;I view our purchasing and supply area as a major contributor to the bottom
line and critical to the service capabilities of our railroad company,&rdquo; says Munoz. Accomplish-
ing their mission requires a staff of dedicated professionals who can ensure availability of
the locomotives, cars, track, and maintenance parts needed to keep CSX trains running at a
very demanding operating capacity. Chinnici and Munoz both are optimistic that their sourc-
ing group will continue to build on their string of recent successes. The ROAR is back . . . at
least at CSX Purchasing and Materials.

<p>4 Part 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As the CSX story illustrates, the development of progressive purchasing approaches
and strategies can help a company maintain or improve its competitive position. In re-
ality, it is only recently that managers would even place the words &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; and
&ldquo;purchasing&rdquo; in the same sentence. Not so long ago, the life of a purchasing profes-
sional was comfortable and predictable. When someone required something, a buyer
sent a request to suppliers for competitive bids, awarded short-term contracts based
on price, enjoyed a free lunch or ball game with salespeople, and figured out how to
meet not-too-demanding performance measures. Although the buying position did
not carry much prestige, it was a good way to earn a pension.
</p>
<p>This model worked relatively well until new competitors from around the world
showed there was a better way to manage purchasing and the supply base. New and
better methods helped these competitors achieve dramatic reductions in cost, expo-
nential improvements in quality, and unheard-of reductions in the time it takes to de-
velop new products. This new model featured closer relationships with important
suppliers, performing due diligence on suppliers before awarding long-term con-
tracts, conducting worldwide Internet searches for the best sources of supply, and par-
ticipating with suppliers during product and process development. Furthermore,
executive managers began to require purchasing professionals to achieve demanding
performance improvements. What really changed the purchasers&rsquo; comfortable world,
and ended the era of free lunches, was global competition. Borrowing a phrase from
Thomas Friedman, the world is flat and competition is now 24/7, anywhere and
anytime.1
</p>
<p>As is illustrated in the CSX story, global sourcing is a requirement and no longer
a luxury for most firms. This chapter introduces the reader to the changing world of
purchasing and supply chain management. It is a world that has changed more dur-
ing the last 15 years than the previous 150 years combined. The first section of this
chapter describes the new competitive environment where we now operate&mdash;an envi-
ronment that affects every major industry. We next present the reasons why purchas-
ing has taken on increased importance. Third, we clarify the confusing terminology
that surrounds purchasing and supply chain management. The next sections present
the activities that are part of supply chain management, discuss the four enablers of
purchasing and supply chain excellence, and review the historic evolution of purchas-
ing and supply chain management. The last section outlines the contents of this
book.
</p>
<p>A New Competitive Environment
The new millennium features increasing numbers of world-class competitors, do-
</p>
<p>mestically and internationally, that are forcing organizations to improve their inter-
nal processes to stay competitive. Sophisticated customers, both industrial and
consumer, no longer talk about price increases&mdash;they demand price reductions! Infor-
mation that is available over the Internet will continue to alter the balance of power
between buyers and sellers. An abundance of competitors and choices have condi-
tioned customers to want higher quality, faster delivery, and products and services tai-
lored to their individual needs at a lower total cost. If a company cannot meet these
requirements, the customer will find someone who is more accommodating.
</p>
<p>Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, companies began to develop detailed market
strategies that focused on creating and capturing customer loyalty. Before long,

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>organizations also realized that this required a strong engineering, design, and
manufacturing function to support these market requirements. Design engineers had
to translate customer requirements into product and service specifications, which
then had to be produced at a high level of quality at a reasonable cost. As the de-
mand for new products increased throughout the 1980s, organizations had to be-
come flexible and responsive to modify existing products, services, and processes, or
to develop new ones to meet ever-changing customer needs.
</p>
<p>As organizational capabilities improved further in the 1990s, managers began to re-
alize that material and service inputs from suppliers had a major impact on their abil-
ity to meet customer needs. This led to an increased focus on the supply base and
the responsibilities of purchasing. Managers also realized that producing a quality
product was not enough. Getting the right products and services to customers at the
right time, cost, place, condition, and quantity constituted an entirely new type of
challenge. More recently, new technology has spawned a whole set of time-reducing
information technologies and logistics networks aimed at meeting these new chal-
lenges. The availability of low-cost alternatives has led to unprecedented shifts to-
ward outsourcing and offshoring. The impact of China as a major world competitor
poses tremendous challenges for U.S. firms in both the manufacturing and services
sectors. Because the services sector now accounts for over 70% of the Gross Domes-
tic Product, new strategies are required for effective supply management in this
sector.
</p>
<p>All these changes have made 21st-century organizations realize how important it
is to manage their supply base. They must be involved in the management of (or at
least take a serious interest in) the suppliers that provide materials and services. They
must also be concerned with the network of downstream firms responsible for deliv-
ery and aftermarket service of the product to the end customer. From this realization
emerged the concept of the supply chain and supply chain management.
</p>
<p>Several factors are driving an emphasis on supply chain management. First, the
cost and availability of information resources between entities in the supply chain al-
low easy linkages that eliminate time delays in the network. Second, the level of com-
petition in both domestic and international markets requires organizations to be fast,
agile, and flexible. Third, customer expectations and requirements are becoming
much more demanding. Fourth, the ability of an organization&rsquo;s supply chain to react
rapidly to major disruptions in both supply and downstream product or services will
lessen the impact on lost sales. As demands increase, organizations and their suppli-
ers must be responsive or face the prospect of losing market share. Competition to-
day is no longer between firms, it is between the supply chains of those firms. The
companies that configure the best supply chains will be the market winners and gain
competitive advantage.
</p>
<p>Why Purchasing Is Important
As companies struggle to increase customer value by improving performance,
</p>
<p>many companies are turning their attention to purchasing and supply management.
Consider, for example, CSX, the company featured at the beginning of this chapter.
Over 40% of the total sales of CSX is expended with suppliers for the purchase of ma-
terials and services. It does not take a financial genius to realize the impact that suppli-
ers can have on a firm&rsquo;s total cost. Furthermore, many features that make their way

<p>6 Part 1 Introduction</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>into final products originate with suppliers. The supply base is an important part of
the supply chain. Supplier capabilities can help differentiate a producer&rsquo;s final good
or service.
</p>
<p>In the manufacturing sector the percentage of purchases to sales averages 55%.
This means that for every dollar of revenue collected on goods and services sales,
more than half goes back to suppliers. It is not difficult to see why purchasing is
clearly a major area for cost savings. However, savings come in different forms; the
traditional approach is to bargain hard for price reductions. A newer approach is to
build relations with suppliers to jointly pull costs out of the product or service.
</p>
<p>A three-year study within the automobile industry studied the extent to which ma-
jor producers emphasized relationships. The results showed a clear difference in the
approach taken to managing suppliers. When suppliers were asked to rate their auto-
mobile customers, the Japanese transplants Toyota, Honda, and Nissan were all
above the median on their &ldquo;Supplier Relations Working Index&rdquo; score, whereas Chrys-
ler, Ford, and General Motors were rated below the median. This says something
about how suppliers perceive the dominant purchasing philosophy of these large auto-
mobile companies. The 17-category index measured key supplier relationship param-
eters including relationship development and communications. Out of a maximum
score of 500, Toyota was first with an index score of 399, while General Motors was
last with a score of 144. The superior management of supplier relationships has
helped give Japanese automobile producers a cost advantage over Detroit&rsquo;s Big
Three.2
</p>
<p>Purchasing and supply management also has a major impact on product and ser-
vice quality. In many cases, companies are seeking to increase the proportion of
parts, components, and services they outsource in order to concentrate on their own
areas of specialization and competence. This further increases the importance of the
relationships between purchasing, external suppliers, and quality.
</p>
<p>The following example illustrates this important link between supplier quality and
product quality. Heparin is a main ingredient in products for patients requiring dialy-
sis and medicines that prevent blood clots during surgery and thin the blood. Hepa-
rin has recently come under suspicion in the deaths of four Americans and allergic
reactions from another 350 patients who obtained heparin from Baxter International.
Interestingly, more than half of the world&rsquo;s heparin comes from China. The recent
deaths have highlighted the need to control sourcing accountability. One of the key in-
gredients in the process of making heparin is pulp extracted from pig intestines,
which is then heated in large vats. This key ingredient is widely sourced in small,
poorly regulated Chinese factories. For example, one Chinese firm, Yuan Intestine
and Casing Factory, also manufactures sausage casings. Baxter buys its heparin from
Scientific Protein. The president of Scientific Protein says it can&rsquo;t trace its supplies in
China as well as it can in the United States. The example illustrates the importance
of the supplier selection process and its role in the entire supply chain, from raw mate-
rial to finished product. This example further illustrates how lapses in managing sup-
plier quality can potentially tarnish a firm&rsquo;s reputation.3
</p>
<p>Purchasing, acting as the liaison between suppliers and engineers, can also help im-
prove product and process designs. For example, companies that involve suppliers
early, compared to companies that do not involve suppliers, achieve an average 20%
reduction in materials cost, 20% improvement in material quality, and 20% reduction
in product development time. Development teams that include suppliers as members

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>also report they receive more improvement suggestions from suppliers than teams
that do not involve suppliers. Thus involving suppliers early in the design process is
a way purchasing can begin to add new value and contribute to increasing their
competitiveness.
</p>
<p>Many executives will agree that a focus on effective purchasing has become a criti-
cal way to gain competitive advantage. An indication of this enhanced reputation
and recognition is the higher salaries that are being paid to purchasing professionals.
The most recent Purchasing magazine salary survey showed an average annual in-
come of $84,611. Interestingly, those with responsibility for sourcing services are
among the highest earners in the profession, with an average annual compensation of
$104,110. Purchasers who buy IT goods and services make $101,104, and those pur-
chasing logistics services are compensated $97,802. Additionally, the survey found
that purchasers continue to make more when compared to their colleagues in other re-
lated fields, such as logistics and engineering. Eighty percent of purchasing executives
made over $100,000, with bonuses averaging over 13% of base salaries.4
</p>
<p>Understanding the Language of Purchasing
and Supply Chain Management
</p>
<p>Anyone who has written about purchasing and supply chain management has de-
fined the various terms associated with these concepts one way or another, making
confusion about the subjects a real possibility. How, for example, is purchasing differ-
ent from supply management? Are supply chains and value chains the same? What is
supply chain management? What is an extended enterprise? It is essential to define
various terms before proceeding with this book.
</p>
<p>Purchasing and Supply Management
We need to recognize the differences between purchasing and supply manage-
</p>
<p>ment. Purchasing is a functional group (i.e., a formal entity on the organizational
chart) as well as a functional activity (i.e., buying goods and services). The purchas-
ing group performs many activities to ensure it delivers maximum value to the organi-
zation. Examples include supplier identification and selection, buying, negotiation
and contracting, supply market research, supplier measurement and improvement,
and purchasing systems development. Purchasing has been referred to as doing &ldquo;the
five rights&rdquo;: getting the right quality, in the right quantity, at the right time, for the
right price, from the right source. In this text we will interchange the terms &ldquo;purchas-
ing&rdquo; and &ldquo;procurement.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Supply management is not just a new name for purchasing but a more inclusive
concept. We feel supply management is a strategic approach to planning for and acquir-
ing the organization&rsquo;s current and future needs through effectively managing the sup-
ply base, utilizing a process orientation in conjunction with cross-functional teams
(CFTs) to achieve the organizational mission. Similar to our definition, the Institute
for Supply Management defines supply management as the identification, acquisition,
access, positioning, and management of resources and related capabilities an organiza-
tion needs or potentially needs in the attainment of its strategic objectives.5 Exhibit 1.1
depicts the key elements in our definition of supply management.

<p>8 Part 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Supply management requires pursuing strategic responsibilities, which are those ac-
tivities that have a major impact on longer-term performance of the organization.
These longer-term responsibilities are not pursued in isolation, but should be aligned
with the overall mission and strategies of the organization. These strategies exclude
routine, simple, or day-to-day decisions that may be part of traditional purchasing re-
sponsibilities. The routine ordering and follow-up of basic operational supplies is not
a strategic responsibility. The development of the systems that enable internal users
to order routine supplies, however, is considerably more important.
</p>
<p>Supply management is a broader concept than purchasing. Supply management is
a progressive approach to managing the supply base that differs from a traditional
arm&rsquo;s-length or adversarial approach with sellers. It requires purchasing professionals
to work directly with those suppliers that are capable of providing world-class perfor-
mance and advantages to the buyer. Think of supply management as a progressive
and supercharged version of basic purchasing.
</p>
<p>Supply management often takes a process approach to obtaining required goods
and services. We can describe supply management as the process of identifying, evalu-
ating, selecting, managing, and developing suppliers to realize supply chain perfor-
mance that is better than that of competitors. We will interchange the terms &ldquo;supply
management&rdquo; and &ldquo;strategic sourcing&rdquo; throughout this book.

<p>Supply management is cross-functional, meaning it involves purchasing, engineer-
ing, supplier quality assurance, the supplier, and other related functions working to-
gether as one team, early on, to further mutual goals.6 Instead of adversarial
relationships, which characterize traditional purchasing, supply management features
a long-term win-win relationship between a buying company and specially selected
suppliers. Except for ownership, the supplier almost becomes an extension of the buy-
ing company. Supply management also involves concrete, on-site, and frequent help
to suppliers in exchange for dramatic and continuous performance improvements, in-
cluding steady price reductions. In short, supply management is a new way of operat-
ing, involving internal operations and external suppliers to achieve advances in cost
management, product development, cycle times, and total quality control.
</p>
<p>Organizationally, leading and coordinating strategic supply management activities
has largely become the responsibility of the functional group called purchasing. Prac-
ticing professionals often use the terms &ldquo;supply management&rdquo; and &ldquo;purchasing&rdquo; inter-
changeably. Through the above discussion we have sought to clarify some of the
differences while recognizing that good purchasing and supply management practices
can have significant impact on the organization&rsquo;s overall performance.
</p>
<p>Supply Chains and Value Chains
Over time, researchers and practitioners have developed dozens of definitions to
</p>
<p>describe supply chains and supply chain management. One group of researchers has
indicated that defining supply chain management both as a philosophy and as a set
of operational activities7 creates confusion. These researchers break down the concept
into three areas and separate supply chain orientation from supply chains and from
supply chain management.
</p>
<p>A supply chain orientation is a higher-level recognition of the strategic value of man-
aging operational activities and flows within and across a supply chain. A supply
chain is a set of three or more organizations linked directly by one or more of the up-
stream or downstream flows of products, services, finances, and information from a
source to a customer. Supply chain management, then, endorses a supply chain orienta-
tion and involves proactively managing the two-way movement and coordination of
goods, services, information, and funds (i.e., the various flows) from raw material
through end user. According to this definition, supply chain management requires
the coordination of activities and flows that extend across boundaries. Organizations
that endorse a supply chain orientation are likely to emphasize supply chain
management.8
</p>
<p>Regardless of the definition or supply chain perspective used, we should recognize
that supply chains are composed of interrelated activities that are internal and exter-
nal to a firm. These activities are diverse in their scope; the participants who support
them are often located across geographic boundaries and often come from diverse
cultures.
</p>
<p>Although many activities are part of supply chain management (which a later sec-
tion discusses), an improved perspective visualizes supply chains as composed of pro-
cesses rather than discrete, often poorly aligned activities and tasks. A process
consists of a set of interrelated tasks or activities designed to achieve a specific objec-
tive or outcome. New-product development (NPD), customer-order fulfillment, sup-
plier evaluation and selection, and demand and supply planning are examples of
critical organizational processes that are part of supply chain management. Recent

<p>product recalls of consumer products such as toys, peanut butter, and dog food have
placed increasing emphasis on a new supply chain concept: the reverse supply chain;
its goal is to rapidly identify and return these tainted products back through the sup-
ply chain.
</p>
<p>Conceiving of supply chains as a series of systematic processes makes sense for a
number of reasons. Almost by definition, processes usually move across functional
boundaries, which aligns well with a supply management and supply chain orienta-
tion. Well-communicated processes also accelerate learning as participants become fa-
miliar with a defined process. Furthermore, formal supply chain processes can &ldquo;build
in&rdquo; best practices and knowledge that enhance the likelihood of success. Perhaps
most importantly, organizations can document, measure, and improve their supply
chain processes.
</p>
<p>A question that often arises, and one that has no definite answer, involves the dif-
ference between a value chain and a supply chain. Michael Porter, who first articu-
lated the value chain concept in the 1980s, argues that a firm&rsquo;s value chain is
composed of primary and support activities that can lead to competitive advantage
when configured properly. Exhibit 1.2 presents a modified version of Porter&rsquo;s value
chain model. This exhibit also defines some important supply chain&ndash;related terms
and places them in their proper context.
</p>
<p>One way to think about the difference between a value chain and supply chain is
to conceptualize the supply chain as a subset of the value chain. All personnel within
an organization are part of a value chain. The same is not true about supply chains.
The primary activities, or the horizontal flow across Exhibit 1.2, represent the opera-
tional part of the value chain, or what some refer to as the supply chain. At an organi-
zational level, the value chain is broader than the supply chain, because it includes all

<p>activities in the form of primary and support activities. Furthermore, the original
value chain concept focused primarily on internal participants, whereas a supply
chain, by definition, is both internally and externally focused.
</p>
<p>To reflect current thinking, we must expand the original value chain model, which
focused primarily on internal participants, to include suppliers and customers who re-
side well upstream and downstream from the focal organization. Multiple levels of
suppliers and customers form the foundation for the extended value chain or the ex-
tended enterprise concept, which states that success is a function of effectively manag-
ing a linked group of firms past first-level suppliers or customers. In fact, progressive
firms understand that managing cost, quality, and delivery requires attention to sup-
pliers that reside several tiers from the producer. The extended enterprise concept rec-
ognizes explicitly that competition is no longer between firms but rather between
coordinated supply chains or networks of firms.
</p>
<p>Notice that Exhibit 1.2 identifies purchasing as a support activity. This means that
purchasing provides a service to internal customers. Although purchasing is the cen-
tral link with suppliers that provide direct materials, which is the upstream or left-
hand side of Exhibit 1.2, purchasing can support the materials and service require-
ments of any internal group. (Direct materials are those items provided by suppliers
and used directly during production or service delivery.) Purchasing is becoming in-
creasingly responsible for sourcing indirect goods and services required by internal
groups. Examples of indirect items include personal computers, office and janitorial
supplies, health care contracts, transportation services, advertising and media, and
travel. Although indirect items are not required for production, they are still vital to
the effective running of an organization. The right-hand side of the model illustrates
the customer, or downstream, portion of the supply chain. Because meeting or exceed-
ing customer expectations is the lifeblood of any organization, it should become the
focal point of supply chain activities. Exhibit 1.2 presents a relatively straightforward
and linear view of the value and supply chain, which is often not the case. First, the
flows of materials, information, funds, and knowledge across a supply chain are often
fragmented and uncoordinated. The &ldquo;hand-off&rdquo; points from one group to the next or
from one organization to the next usually provide opportunity for improvements. Sec-
ond, the value chain model shows suppliers linking with inbound logistics and then
operations. Although this is usually the case with direct materials, indirect items and
finished goods sourced externally can result in suppliers delivering to any part of the
supply chain.
</p>
<p>Supply Chains Illustrated
The increasing importance of supply chain management is forcing organizations
</p>
<p>to rethink how their purchasing and sourcing strategies fit with and support broader
business and supply chain objectives. Supply chains involve multiple organizations as
we move toward the raw material suppliers or downstream toward the ultimate cus-
tomer. Simple supply chains pull materials directly from their origin, process them,
package them, and ship them to consumers.
</p>
<p>A good example of a simple supply chain involves cereal producers (see Exhibit
1.3). A cereal company purchases the grain from a farmer and processes it into ce-
real. The cereal company also purchases the paperboard from a paper manufacturer,
which purchased the trees to make the paper, and labels from a label manufacturer,
which purchased semifinished label stock to make the labels. The cereal is then pack-
aged and sent to a distributor, which in turn ships the material to a grocer, who then

<p>sells it to an end customer. Even for a simple product such as cereal, the number of
transactions and of material and information flows can be considerable.
</p>
<p>The supply chain for the cereal manufacturer features an extensive distribution net-
work that is involved in getting the packaged cereal to the final customer. Within the
downstream portion of the supply chain, logistics managers are responsible for the ac-
tual movement of materials between locations. One major part of logistics is transpor-
tation management, involving the selection and management of external carriers
(trucking companies, airlines, railroads, shipping companies) or the management of
internal private fleets of carriers. Distribution management involves the management
of packaging, storing, and handling of materials at receiving docks, warehouses, and
retail outlets.
</p>
<p>For products such as automobiles, which feature multiple products, technologies,
and processes, the supply chain becomes more complicated. The materials, planning,
and logistics supply chain for an automotive company is shown in Exhibit 1.4 on
p. 14, which illustrates the complexity of the chain, spanning from automotive deal-
ers back through multiple levels or tiers of suppliers. The automotive company&rsquo;s sup-
plier network includes the thousands of firms that provide items ranging from raw
materials, such as steel and plastics, to complex assemblies and subassemblies, such
as transmissions, brakes, and engines.
</p>
<p>Participants in a supply chain are willing to share such information only when
there is trust between members. Thus, the management of relationships with other

<p>parties in the chain becomes paramount. Organizations are effectively forming new
types of relationships (sometimes called &ldquo;partnerships&rdquo; or &ldquo;alliances&rdquo;) that require
shared resources. For instance, organizations may provide dedicated capacity, specific
information, technological capabilities, or even direct financial support to other mem-
bers of their supply chain so that the entire chain can benefit.
</p>
<p>Achieving Purchasing and Supply Chain Benefits
When the pieces come together, can assuming a supply chain orientation with the
</p>
<p>right kinds of activities really produce the results envisioned by proponents? Con-
sider the rebirth of Apple Computer, which had BusinessWeek asking in 1997, &ldquo;Is Ap-
ple mincemeat?&rdquo; Apple made a great comeback through an impressive, steady stream
of new and innovative products such as the iPod, iPod Nano, and iPhone. Apple has
re-engineered itself from being considered &ldquo;mincemeat&rdquo; to now once again being the
&ldquo;darling of Wall Street.&rdquo;9 Facilitating this turnaround was Apple&rsquo;s pursuit of an im-
pressive array of purchasing and supply chain activities to manage product demand,
inventory investment, channel distribution, and supply chain relationships. The com-
pany reduced its product line by almost half, forecasted sales weekly instead of
monthly with daily adjustments to production, and relied on suppliers to manage in-
ventory for standard parts and components. Apple also formalized a partnership
with a supplier to build components close to Apple facilities with just-in-time (JIT) de-
livery, created a direct ship distribution network through the Web, and simplified its
finished goods distribution channel. Because of these activities, Apple now rivals, and
sometimes exceeds, Dell Computer in terms of supply chain performance.
</p>
<p>The Supply Chain Umbrella
A large set of activities besides purchasing is part of supply chain management.
</p>
<p>Each of these seemingly diverse activities has one important feature in common&mdash;
it is part of a network that will define how efficiently and effectively goods and
information flow across a supply chain. Although the need to perform supply chain&ndash;
related activities has been present for many years, it is an organization&rsquo;s willingness
to align, coordinate, integrate, and synchronize these activities and flows that is rela-
tively new. What are the activities that are part of this concept called supply chain
management?
</p>
<p>Management Activities
</p>
<p>Purchasing
Most organizations include purchasing as a major supply chain activity. Because
</p>
<p>purchasing is the central focus of this book, there is no need to provide more detail
here.
</p>
<p>Inbound Transportation
Larger organizations usually have a specialized traffic and transportation function
</p>
<p>to manage the physical and informational links between the supplier and the buyer.
For some organizations, transportation is the single largest category of single costs,

</p>
<p>Chapter 1 Introduction to Purchasing and Supply Chain Management 15</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>especially for highly diversified organizations. Although a firm may have minimal
common purchase requirements among its operating units, there usually are opportu-
nities to coordinate the purchase of transportation services.
</p>
<p>Quality Control
Quality control has taken on increased importance during the last 15 years. Al-
</p>
<p>most all organizations recognize the importance of supplier quality and the need to
prevent, rather than simply detect, quality problems. The emphasis has shifted from
detecting defects at the time of receipt or use to prevention early in the materials-
sourcing process. Progressive organizations work directly with suppliers to develop
proper quality control procedures and processes.
</p>
<p>Demand and Supply Planning
Demand planning identifies all the claims (or demand) on output. This includes
</p>
<p>forecasts of anticipated demand, inventory adjustments, orders taken but not filled,
and spare-part and aftermarket requirements. Supply planning is the process of tak-
ing demand data and developing a supply, production, and logistics network capable
of satisfying demand requirements.
</p>
<p>Receiving, Materials Handling, and Storage
All inbound material must be physically received as it moves from a supplier to a
</p>
<p>purchaser. In a non-just-in-time environment, material must also be stored or staged.
Receiving, materials handling, and storage are usually part of the materials manage-
ment function because of the need to control the physical processing and handling of
inventory. Receipts from users indicating that services have been performed are also
run through receiving to trigger invoice payment.
</p>
<p>Materials or Inventory Control
The terms &ldquo;materials control&rdquo; and &ldquo;inventory control&rdquo; are sometimes used inter-
</p>
<p>changeably. Within some organizations, however, these terms have different mean-
ings. The materials control group is often responsible for determining the
appropriate quantity to order based on projected demand and then managing materi-
als releases to suppliers. This includes generating the materials release, contacting a
supplier directly concerning changes, and monitoring the status of inbound ship-
ments. Materials control activities are sometimes the responsibility of the purchasing
department, particularly in smaller organizations.
</p>
<p>The inventory control group is often responsible for determining the inventory
level of finished goods required to support customer requirements, which emphasizes
the physical distribution (i.e., outbound or downstream) side of the supply chain. Inte-
grated supply chain management requires that the materials and inventory control
groups coordinate their efforts to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted flow to
customers.
</p>
<p>Order Processing
Order processing helps ensure that customers receive material when and where
</p>
<p>they require it. Problems with order processing have involved accepting orders before
determining if adequate production capacity is available, not coordinating order pro-
cessing with order scheduling, and using internal production dates rather than the

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>customer&rsquo;s preferred date to schedule the order. Order processing is an important
part of supply chain management&mdash;it represents a link between the producer and the
external customer.
</p>
<p>Production Planning, Scheduling, and Control
These activities involve determining a time-phased schedule of production, devel-
</p>
<p>oping short-term production schedules, and controlling work-in-process production.
The production plan often relies on forecasts from marketing to estimate the volume
of materials that are required over the near term. Because operations is responsible
for carrying out the production plan and meeting customer order due dates, order
processing, production planning, and operations must work together closely.
</p>
<p>Warehousing/Distribution
Before a product heads to the customer, it may be stored for a period in a ware-
</p>
<p>house or distribution center. This is particularly true for companies that produce ac-
cording to a forecast in anticipation of future sales. Increasingly, as companies
attempt to make a product only after receiving a customer order, this part of the sup-
ply chain may become less important.
</p>
<p>Shipping
This activity involves physically getting a product ready for distribution to the cus-
</p>
<p>tomer. This requires packing to prevent damage, completing any special labeling
requirements, completing the required shipping documents, and/or arranging trans-
portation with an approved carrier. For obvious reasons, shipping and outbound trans-
portation must work together closely.
</p>
<p>Outbound Transportation
Fewer organizations &ldquo;own&rdquo; the transportation link to their customers, compared
</p>
<p>with just a few years ago. Increasingly, full-service transportation providers are design-
ing and managing entire distribution networks for their clients.
</p>
<p>Customer Service
Customer service includes a wide set of activities that attempt to keep a customer
</p>
<p>satisfied with a product or service. The three primary elements of customer service
are pre-transaction, transaction, and post-transaction activities.
</p>
<p>Four Enablers of Purchasing and Supply
Chain Management
</p>
<p>Now that we have a better understanding of the terminology surrounding purchas-
ing and supply chain management, we must recognize that excellence in these areas
does not just happen. What separates firms that achieve real benefits from those that
fail to reap any benefits is a commitment to the four enablers of purchasing and sup-
ply chain excellence. These enablers provide the support that makes the development
of progressive strategies and approaches possible. Later chapters present these four
areas in detail.

<p>Exhibit 1.5 presents the four enablers of purchasing and supply chain excellence.
This model shows that firms have certain guiding philosophies and business require-
ments that are the foundation of all supply chain activities. These guiding philoso-
phies and requirements may relate to areas such as globalization, customer
responsiveness, or supply chain integration. The four enablers, in turn, support the de-
velopment of strategies and approaches that not only align with an organization&rsquo;s phi-
losophies and requirements but also support the attainment of purchasing, supply
chain, and organizational objectives and strategies.
</p>
<p>Capable Human Resources
The key to the success of any company is the quality of its employees. This is cer-
</p>
<p>tainly true for purchasing. Exhibit 1.5 identifies, from focus group research, the vari-
ous kinds of knowledge and skills demanded of today&rsquo;s supply chain professional. The
knowledge and skills that purchasing and supply chain professionals require are differ-
ent from just a few years ago. Recent research indicated that the top five knowledge
areas for purchasers of the future were (1) supplier relationship management, (2) to-
tal cost analysis, (3) purchasing strategies, (4) supplier analysis, and (5) competitive
market analysis.10 Effective supply chain management requires close collaboration
with suppliers as well as internal coordination with engineering, procurement, logis-
tics, customers, and marketing to coordinate activities and material flows across the
supply chain. These relationships with key suppliers become the basis for purchasing
strategies. The Babson College Good Practice Example illustrates how suppliers and
the college benefit from developing these strong ties. Developing strong ties often re-
quires purchasers to take a more entrepreneurial approach to running their business.
</p>
<p>Cost-management skills are becoming more important. With an inability to raise
prices to customers, cost management becomes essential to longer-term success. Pur-
chasing specialists at a major U.S. chemical company, for example, evaluate major
supply decisions using total cost models with data provided by suppliers and other
sources. Another company requires its teams to identify upstream cost drivers past
immediate suppliers, which the teams then target for improvement. Cost manage-
ment has become an integral part of purchasing and supply chain management.
These analyses of total cost are then imposed upon the market situation and analysis
of supplier capabilities to arrive at an overall purchasing strategy.
</p>
<p>Gaining access to the right skills will require a sound human-resources strategy
that includes internal development of high-potential individuals, recruiting talent
from other functional groups or companies, and hiring promising college graduates.
This occurs to satisfy one primary objective&mdash;ensuring that qualified participants are
available to support purchasing and supply chain requirements.
</p>
<p>Proper Organizational Design
Organizational design refers to the process of assessing and selecting the structure
</p>
<p>and formal system of communication, division of labor, coordination, control, au-
thority, and responsibility required to achieve organizational goals and objectives,
including supply chain objectives.11 Although formal charts illustrate an organi-
zation&rsquo;s formal design, they also present an incomplete picture. Organizational design
is much more than a series of lines and boxes across a chart.12 Exhibit 1.5 high-
lights the more important features that promote the achievement of purchasing
objectives.13

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The use of teams as part of supply chain design will continue to be important.
However, managers should use teams selectively. Few studies have established a clear
connection between teaming and higher performance, and even fewer have quantita-
tively assessed the impact of teaming on corporate performance. The use of organiza-
tional work teams to support purchasing and supply chain objectives does not
guarantee greater effectiveness.
</p>
<p>Real-Time and Shared Information
Technology Capabilities
</p>
<p>The development of information technology (IT) software and platforms that
support an end-to-end supply chain have grown rapidly in the 21st century, as have
identification technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID). These
technologies allow enhanced collaboration between the parties in the supply chain.
One example of this is highlighted by the mission of e-supply chain company EPIC:
&ldquo;EPIC delivers a comprehensive product line that enhances enterprise profit margins
through collaboration and real-time connectivity.&rdquo;14 Software packages that are gain-
ing the attention of purchasers include e-purchasing suites (see Chapter 18), which
have become popular with firms. Two primary supply chain applications involved in
supply chain collaboration that involve purchasing are supply chain planning and sup-
ply chain execution. Planning software seeks to improve forecast accuracy, optimize
production scheduling, reduce working capital costs, shorten cycle times, cut transpor-
tation costs, and improve customer service. Execution software helps obtain materials
and manage physical flows from suppliers through downstream distribution to en-
sure that customers receive the right products at the right location, time, and cost.
</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of information technology platform or software used, sup-
ply chain systems should capture and share information across functional groups and
organizational boundaries on a real-time or near-real-time basis. This may involve
transmitting the location of transportation vehicles using global positioning systems
(GPSs), using Internet-based systems to transmit material requirements to suppliers,
or using bar code technology to monitor the timeliness of receipts from suppliers.
RFID tags are being used in more applications to capture real-time data about mate-
rial and product movement across the supply chain.
</p>
<p>Examples regarding the relationship between information technology and supply
chain excellence are not hard to find. TaylorMade adidas has led the golf industry&rsquo;s
technological revolution since its founding in 1979. TaylorMade uses supply chain
planning and execution software from i2 to optimize its end-to-end supply chain ac-
tivities. It all starts with demand planning, which is needed to manage TaylorMade&rsquo;s
strong yet unpredictable product sales. For example, when a competitor dropped its
prices on a new line of titanium drivers, demand spiked much higher than the com-
pany anticipated. This resulted in multiple suppliers being required to meet the extra
demand at a premium cost. The new system enables improved visibility into de-
mand, which can then be immediately seen by the purchasing function, permitting a
more integrated approach to sourcing and reduced inventory. Demand from retail
customers is now collected on wireless devices by sales representatives, who then
transmit it to the warehouse. If stock is not available at the warehouse, then another
wireless transmission is made to the TaylorMade facility. This may require purchas-
ing action to obtain the desired components to complete the order. By sharing de-
mand forecasts with suppliers, every member of the chain now has demand visibility,
allowing better planning on all fronts. Suppliers now can look ahead and improve

<p>their schedules and TaylorMade gets shipments of items that are needed to satisfy cus-
tomer requirements with less inventory. One of TaylorMade&rsquo;s executives sums it up:
&ldquo;In the past we never really knew how much we were going to sell in one period; as
a result we built up inventory to guard against placing customers on backorder.&rdquo;15
</p>
<p>Right Measures and Measurement Systems
The right measures and measurement systems represent the fourth pillar support-
</p>
<p>ing purchasing and supply chain excellence. Unfortunately, there are many road-
blocks between measurement and improved performance. Some of these include (1)
too many metrics, (2) debate over the correct metrics, (3) constantly changing met-
rics, and (4) old data.16 Overcoming these roadblocks requires that the organization
know what it wants to measure, has a process in place to measure it, and has accessi-
bility to the right data. The next step involves taking action on the measurement
data.17 Finally, as with any planning system, the targets are revised to reflect the reali-
ties of the marketplace, competition, and changing goals of the organization.
</p>
<p>Why is measurement so important? First, objective measurement supports fact-
based rather than subjective decision making. Secondly, measurement is also an ideal
way to communicate requirements to other supply chain members and to promote
continuous improvement and change. When suppliers know their performance is be-
ing monitored, they are likely to perform better. Many firms use the measurement sys-
tem not only to improve future supplier performance but also to recognize
outstanding performance. For example, United Technologies awarded two suppliers
its &ldquo;General Procurement Key Supplier Award.&rdquo;18 Measurement also conveys what is
important by linking critical measures to desired business outcomes. The measure-
ment process also helps determine if new initiatives are producing the desired results.
Finally, measurement may be the single best tool to control purchasing and supply
chain activities and processes.
</p>
<p>Although there is no definitive or prescriptive set of supply chain measures, and
there certainly is no one best way to measure supply chain performance, we do know
that effective measures and measurement systems satisfy certain criteria. These crite-
ria, which Exhibit 1.5 summarizes, provide a set of principles with which to assess sup-
ply chain measures and measurement systems.
</p>
<p>These four enablers support the pursuit of progressive approaches and strategies
that begin to define purchasing and supply chain excellence. If organizations ignore
these areas, they will see their ability to develop progressive practices and approaches
fall short of competitors that have stressed these enabling areas.
</p>
<p>The Evolution of Purchasing and Supply
Chain Management
</p>
<p>There have been more changes affecting purchasing over the last 15 years than
over the previous 125 years. To appreciate how we arrived at where we are today re-
quires a brief understanding of the evolution of purchasing and supply chain manage-
ment, although some might argue the last 15 years resembled a revolution. This
evolution covers seven periods spanning the last 150 years. S

<p>Chapter 1 Introduction to Purchasing and Supply Chain Management 21</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Period 1: The Early Years (1850&ndash;1900)
Some observers define the early years of purchasing history as beginning after
</p>
<p>1850. There is evidence, however, that the purchasing function received attention be-
fore this date. Charles Babbage&rsquo;s book on the economy of machinery and manu-
facturers, published in 1832, referred to the importance of the purchasing function.
Babbage also alluded to a &ldquo;materials man&rdquo; responsible for several different functions.
Babbage wrote that a central officer responsible for operating mines was &ldquo;a materials
man who selects, purchases, receives, and delivers all articles required.&rdquo;19
</p>
<p>In the textile industry, the selling agent often handled purchasing and was also re-
sponsible for the output, quality, and style of the cloth. The selling agent was responsi-
ble for all purchasing decisions, because the grade of cotton purchased was a factor
in determining the quality of the cloth produced. Customer orders were transformed
into purchase orders (POs) for cotton and subsequently into planned production.20
</p>
<p>The greatest interest in and development of purchasing during the early years oc-
curred after the 1850s. During this period, the growth of American railroads made
them one of the major forces in the economy. Railroads were vital to the country&rsquo;s
ability to move goods from the more developed Eastern and Midwestern markets to
less developed Southern and Western markets. By 1866, the Pennsylvania Railroad
had given the purchasing function departmental status, under the title of Supplying
Department. A few years later, the head purchasing agent at the Pennsylvania Rail-
road reported directly to the president of the railroad. The purchasing function was
such a major contributor to the performance of the organization that the chief pur-
chasing manager had top managerial status.21
</p>
<p>The comptroller of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad wrote the first book ex-
clusively about the purchasing function, The Handling of Railway Supplies&mdash;Their Pur-
chase and Disposition, in 1887. He discussed purchasing issues that are still critical
today, including the need for technical expertise in purchasing agents along with the
need to centralize the purchasing department under one individual. The author also
commented on the lack of attention given to the selection of personnel to fill the posi-
tion of purchasing agent.
</p>
<p>The growth of the railroad industry dominated the early years of purchasing devel-
opment. Major contributions to purchasing history during this period consisted of
early recognition of the purchasing process and its contribution to overall company
profitability. The late 1800s signaled the beginning of organizing purchasing as a sepa-
rate corporate function requiring specialized expertise. Before this period, this separa-
tion did not exist.
</p>
<p>Period 2: Growth of Purchasing Fundamentals
(1900&ndash;1939)
</p>
<p>The second period of purchasing evolution began around the turn of the 20th cen-
tury and lasted until the beginning of World War II. Articles specifically addressing
the industrial purchasing function began appearing with increasing regularity outside
the railroad trade journals. Engineering magazines in particular focused attention
on the need for qualified purchasing personnel and the development of materials
specifications.
</p>
<p>This era also witnessed the development of basic purchasing procedures and ideas.

<p>purchasing book&mdash;was published. The Book on Buying contained 18 chapters, each
written by a different author.22 The editors devoted the first section of the book to
the &ldquo;principles&rdquo; of buying. The second section described the forms and procedures
used in various company purchasing systems.
</p>
<p>Purchasing gained importance during World War I because of its role in obtain-
ing vital war materials. Purchasing&rsquo;s central focus during this period was on the pro-
curement of raw material versus buying finished or semifinished goods. Ironically,
the years during World War I featured no publication of any major purchasing
books. Harold T. Lewis, a respected purchasing professional during the 1930s
through the 1950s, noted that there was considerable doubt about the existence of
any general recognition of purchasing as being important to a company. Lewis noted
that from World War I to 1945, at least a gradual if uneven recognition developed of
the importance of sound procurement to company operation.
</p>
<p>Period 3: The War Years (1940&ndash;1946)
World War II introduced a new period in purchasing history. The emphasis on ob-
</p>
<p>taining required (and scarce) materials during the war influenced a growth in purchas-
ing interest. In 1933, only nine colleges offered courses related to purchasing. By
1945, this number had increased to 49 colleges. The membership of the National Asso-
ciation of Purchasing Agents increased from 3,400 in 1934 to 5,500 in 1940 to 9,400
in the autumn of 1945. A study conducted during this period revealed that 76% of
all purchase requisitions contained no specifications or stipulation of brand. This sug-
gested that other departments within the firm recognized the role of the purchasing
agent in determining sources of supply.23
</p>
<p>Period 4: The Quiet Years (1947&ndash;Mid-1960s)
The heightened awareness of purchasing that existed during World War II did
</p>
<p>not carry over to the postwar years. John A. Hill, a noted purchasing professional,
commented about the state of purchasing during this period: &ldquo;For many firms, pur-
chases were simply an inescapable cost of doing business which no one could do
much about. So far as the length and breadth of American industry is concerned, the
purchasing function has not yet received in full measure the attention and emphasis
it deserves.&rdquo;24
</p>
<p>Another respected purchasing professional, Bruce D. Henderson, also commented
about the state of affairs facing purchasing. In his words, &ldquo;Procurement is regarded
as a negative function&mdash;it can handicap the company if not done well but can make
little positive contribution.&rdquo;25 He noted that purchasing was a neglected function in
most organizations because it was not important to mainstream problems. He went
on to say that some executives found it hard to visualize a company becoming more
successful than its competitors because of its superior procurement.
</p>
<p>Articles began appearing during this period describing the practices of various
companies using staff members to collect, analyze, and present data for purchasing de-
cisions. Ford Motor Company was one of the first private organizations to establish a
commodity research department to provide short- and long-term commodity infor-
mation.26 Ford also created a purchase analysis department to give buyers assistance
on product and price analysis.
</p>
<p>The postwar period saw the development of the value analysis (VA) technique, pio-
neered by General Electric in 1947. GE&rsquo;s approach concentrated on the evaluation of

<p/>

<p>which materials or changes in specifications and design would reduce overall product
costs. Although important internal purchasing developments occurred during this
era, there was no denying that other disciplines such as marketing and finance over-
shadowed purchasing. The emphasis during the postwar years and throughout the
1960s was on satisfying consumer demand and the needs of a growing industrial mar-
ket. Furthermore, firms faced stable competition and had access to abundant material
&mdash;conditions that historically have diminished the overall importance of purchasing.
The elements that would normally cause an increase in the importance of purchasing
were not present during these quiet years of purchasing history.
</p>
<p>Period 5: Materials Management Comes of Age
(Mid-1960s&ndash;Late 1970s)
</p>
<p>The mid-1960s witnessed a dramatic growth of the materials management con-
cept. Although interest in materials management grew during this period, the con-
cept&rsquo;s historical origins date to the 1800s, when U.S. railroads organized under the
materials management concept during the latter half of the 19th century. They com-
bined related functions such as purchasing, inventory control, receiving, and stores
under the authority of one individual.
</p>
<p>External events directly affected the operation of the typical firm. The Vietnam
War, for example, resulted in upward price and materials availability pressures. Dur-
ing the 1970s, firms experienced materials problems related to oil &ldquo;shortages&rdquo; and em-
bargoes. The logical response of industry was to become more efficient, particularly
in the purchase and control of materials.
</p>
<p>There was widespread agreement about the primary objective of the materials con-
cept and the functions that might fall under the materials umbrella. The overall objec-
tive of materials management was to solve materials problems from a total system
viewpoint rather than the viewpoint of individual functions or activities. The various
functions that might fall under the materials umbrella included materials planning
and control, inventory planning and control, materials and procurement research,
purchasing, incoming traffic, receiving, incoming quality control, stores, materials
movement, and scrap and surplus disposal.
</p>
<p>The behavior of purchasing during this period was notable. Purchasing managers
emphasized multiple sourcing through competitive bid pricing and rarely viewed the
supplier as a value-added partner. Buyers maintained arm&rsquo;s-length relationships with
suppliers. Price competition was the major factor determining supply contracts. The
purchasing strategies and behaviors that evolved over the last half century were inade-
quate when the severe economic recession of the early 1980s and the emergence of for-
eign global competitors occurred. Overall, the function was relegated to secondary
status in many companies. Dean Ammer&rsquo;s classic 1974 article in the Harvard Busi-
ness Review categorized top management&rsquo;s view of purchasing as passive, risk averse,
and a dead-end job. Ammer felt overcoming this perception could be accomplished
by active purchasing, which is measured in terms of meeting overall company objec-
tives and contributing to bottom-line profitability.27 He argued that the purchasing ex-
ecutive should be part of non-purchasing decisions, for the entire organization loses
when purchasing is not part of the organization&rsquo;s consensus on major decisions.28
</p>
<p>Finally, Ammer suggested that the function should have sufficient stature to report to
top management or a division manager. However, this happened in only 37% of his
responding firms.29

<p>Period 6: The Global Era (Late 1970s&ndash;1999)
The global era, and its effect on the importance, structure, and behavior of purchas-
</p>
<p>ing, has already proved different from other historical periods. These differences in-
clude the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Never in our industrial history has competition become so intense so
quickly.
</p>
<p>&bull; Global firms increasingly captured world market share and emphasized dif-
ferent strategies, organizational structures, and management techniques com-
pared with their American counterparts.
</p>
<p>&bull; The spread and rate of technology change during this period was unprece-
dented, with product life cycles becoming shorter.
</p>
<p>&bull; The ability to coordinate worldwide purchasing activity by using interna-
tional data networks and the World Wide Web (via intranets) emerged.
</p>
<p>This intensely competitive period witnessed the growth of supply chain manage-
ment. Now, more than ever, firms began to take a more coordinated view of manag-
ing the flow of goods, services, funds, and information from suppliers through end
customers. Managers began to view supply chain management as a way to satisfy in-
tense cost and other improvement pressures.
</p>
<p>Period 7: Integrated Supply Chain Management
(Beyond 2000)
</p>
<p>Purchasing and supply chain management today reflects a growing emphasis con-
cerning the importance of suppliers. Supplier relationships are shifting from an adver-
sarial approach to a more cooperative approach with selected suppliers. The activities
that the modern purchasing organization must put in place are quite different from
just a few years ago. Supplier development, supplier design involvement, the use of
full-service suppliers, total cost supplier selection, long-term supplier relationships,
strategic cost management, enterprisewide systems (enterprise resource planning, or
ERP) and integrated Internet linkages and shared databases are now seen as ways to
create new value within the supply chain. Purchasing behavior is shifting dramati-
cally to support the performance requirements of the new era.
</p>
<p>It is possible to reach three conclusions about 21st-century purchasing. First, the re-
shaping of purchasing&rsquo;s role in the emerging global economy is under way, in re-
sponse to the challenges presented by worldwide competition and rapidly changing
technology and customer expectations. Second, the overall importance of the purchas-
ing function is increasing, particularly for firms that compete in industries character-
ized by worldwide competition and rapid change. Third, purchasing must continue
to become more integrated with customer requirements, as well as with operations, lo-
gistics, human resources, finance, accounting, marketing, and information systems.
This evolution will take time to occur fully, but the integration is inevitable.
</p>
<p>The history and evolution of purchasing and supply chain management provides
an appreciation for the growth, development, and increased stature of the profession
over the last 150 years. Each historical period has contributed something unique to
the development of purchasing, including the events that have shaped today&rsquo;s empha-
sis on integrated supply chain management. S

<p>Chapter 1 Introduction to Purchasing and Supply Chain Management 25</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Looking Ahead
This book comprises 20 chapters, divided into six parts including this introduction.
</p>
<p>The remainder of this book addresses the major tasks and challenges facing the modern
purchasing professional operating within the context of a dynamic supply chain.
</p>
<p>Part 2, Purchasing Operations and Structure, Chapters 2 through 5, provides a ba-
sic understanding of the functional activity called purchasing. Without a solid under-
standing of basic purchasing processes and organization, appreciating the important
role that purchasing has within a supply chain is difficult.
</p>
<p>With this understanding, Part 3, Strategic Sourcing, considers how purchasing eval-
uates, selects, manages, and improves supplier performance. Chapters 6 through 10
present strategic sourcing activities, which are activities that can affect the competitive-
ness of a firm. The ability to realize advantages from our purchasing and supply ef-
forts requires shifting our view of purchasing from a tactical or clerically oriented
activity to one that focuses on strategic supply management.
</p>
<p>Part 4, Strategic Sourcing Process, recognizes that purchasing professionals must
play a major role in improving supply chain performance. Chapters 11 through 15
present an assortment of tools, techniques, and approaches for managing the procure-
ment and sourcing process, including an understanding of contracting and legal
issues.
</p>
<p>Part 5, Critical Supply Chain Elements, deals extensively with the critical elements
of integrated supply chains from supplier through customer. The activities and topics
presented in Chapters 16 through 19 may or may not be a formal part of the purchas-
ing organization. They are, however, integral stepping stones to effective supply chain
management.
</p>
<p>The last part, Future Directions, contains a single chapter that presents future direc-
tions identified during research and experience with many organizations. The trends
identified in Chapter 20 help us identify how the field of purchasing and supply
chain management is changing, what is behind these changes, and how best to re-
spond. As we move further into the 21st century, this section must change on a con-
tinuous basis to reflect the dynamic changes occurring in purchasing and supply
chain management.

<p>MEET A PURCHASING ENTREPRENEUR
Peter Russo has been an entrepreneur for more than 20 years. His hands-on experience

<p>is diverse&mdash;everything from founding start-ups in his basement, to serving as chairman of a
venture-owned turnaround, to licensing products to billion-dollar companies. He has opened
design, sales, and distribution offices in both China and Japan, overseeing the transition of
production and materials supply from the United States to China. Russo has also created pro-
duction methods that are proprietary to the United States, successfully defending themS

<p>against competitors with overseas sourcing. He&rsquo;s set up direct consumer selling systems and
has developed and sold hundreds of products to America&rsquo;s largest big-box retailers, such as
Wal-Mart, Toys &ldquo;R&rdquo; Us, and Petco.
</p>
<p>So what could entice this serial entrepreneur to leave his own business and become the direc-
tor of purchasing at Babson College? Considering that Babson has the premier entrepreneur-
ship program in the country, according to U.S. News and World Report, it&rsquo;s a perfect
partnership. The academic world has traditionally been characterized as somewhat rigid and
bureaucratic, following traditional rules and regulations engrained by decades of use or im-
posed by state legislators, boards of regents, or other governing boards. Purchasing is no ex-
ception. It, too, operates in a clerical, paper-intense atmosphere. But true to the very
definition of an entrepreneur, Russo believes there is always the ability to innovate, so he de-
cided to come to Babson.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I undertook the challenge only because Babson encouraged me to take a fresh view,&rdquo; says
Russo. &ldquo;They recognize that providing superior service and value can only be achieved by
thinking of supply management as an entrepreneurial business.&rdquo; Russo&rsquo;s approach was to
evaluate college purchasing in the same way he evaluated consumer products. &ldquo;Buying can
usually be segmented into buying processes and customer groups,&rdquo; says Russo.
</p>
<p>In this discussion, Russo focuses on three buying processes and their associated customers:
</p>
<p>1. Automated buying. This empowers the customer to independently purchase and
manage material from a defined inventory. Office supplies are the best example of
this type of purchase.
</p>
<p>2. Competitively bidded buying. This requires the research and evaluation of multiple
options to determine needs, best price, and service levels and is sent to multiple
suppliers soliciting their bids. Examples in this category include desktop printers,
kitchen equipment, software, and construction materials.
</p>
<p>3. Contracted services. This buying process involves using the expertise of suppliers
that team with the college to provide products used on a daily, ongoing basis,
such as dining services and books.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our purchasing department is no different from most companies in the private sector,&rdquo; says
Russo. As he sees it, today&rsquo;s challenge is twofold:
</p>
<p>1. Leverage technology to simplify and automate repetitive activities while capturing
and disseminating information/knowledge.
</p>
<p>2. Maximize strategic alliances for best practices and supply management in areas
that are outside its expertise.
</p>
<p>Russo goes on to explain how Babson&rsquo;s purchasing group plans to address these challenges.
</p>
<p>PREPARING FOR CHANGE
Among Russo&rsquo;s first endeavors was to reinforce the idea and benefit of centralized purchas-
ing, operating on a foundation of service. &ldquo;Creating an effective, efficient process requires
consistent campuswide use,&rdquo; says Russo. &ldquo;To achieve this goal, our purchasing department
would have to be recognized by our customers as capable of reducing complexity and adding
value, knowledge, and skill to the process.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In the past, the typical purchasing process was initiated with the customer coming to the pur-
chasing department with a product and supplier already selected. Overall, the process was
fairly manual, with hand-completed paper forms and little use of technology. Everyone knew

<p>that before a purchase order was placed for any significant buy, policy required three bids to
be received by the purchasing department. Some thought this process turned the purchasing
department into the &ldquo;purchasing police&rdquo;&mdash;a mindset that Russo feels can be avoided with
the proper buying processes. &ldquo;We want to be viewed as fast and flexible, with creative solu-
tions to sourcing,&rdquo; he says.
</p>
<p>Russo inherited an experienced team, led by two veteran staffers with extensive college pur-
chasing experience. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fortunate,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to have a staff that&rsquo;s not just talented
and experienced, but service-minded.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Russo and his team evaluated and modified the buying process to meet the desired format
of the customers, but he felt it would also be critical to increase the campus awareness of
each new service. Russo also wanted to communicate the staff&rsquo;s knowledge and professional-
ism. He and two key staff members are currently taking certification training to become Certi-
fied Purchasing Managers. Raising the bar higher, Russo has set his sights on attaining the
new Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) designation.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of our customers have advanced degrees,&rdquo; says Russo. (It should be added that
Russo considers everyone on campus a customer.) &ldquo;We are obviously in an environment that
values expertise,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;but it takes more than education. It takes motivation to en-
hance credibility. We need to continually increase our level of knowledge, professionalism
and service.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>TAKING CHARGE OF PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS
In his first few weeks at Babson, Russo realized that his purchasing manager, Anne, and his
buyer, Kerrie, were very good at administering the process that was in place. &ldquo;More impor-
tantly, they were well respected by the customers on our campus,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;But I realized
that the antiquated, paper-based system they were using needed updating. It was too labor in-
tensive and dependent on the staff&rsquo;s personal knowledge.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The system was weighed down by lengthy procedures and minimal automation, with no capa-
bilities to assimilate current technology-driven processes, thereby creating two obstacles.
First, Russo&rsquo;s team was prevented from fully leveraging group buying efficiencies or maximiz-
ing product knowledge. Second, Russo was concerned with &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; Should one of the pur-
chasing team leave for another job, a major setback would be inevitable.
</p>
<p>Speaking with his team, Russo discovered that day-to-day operations required 100% of their
attention, leaving little time to enhance the purchasing process. He quickly learned that his
talented staff was drowning in paperwork and telephone calls.
</p>
<p>The inspiration came in the form of a question: What would you do to fix what isn&rsquo;t working?
&ldquo;My staff really had knowledge of which processes were effective and which needed changes.
In many instances they had started to lay out solutions; however, limited time and resources
kept the realization of these improvements on perpetual hold,&rdquo; says Russo. &ldquo;I also believe,&rdquo;
Russo continues, &ldquo;that an effective purchasing process is built upon the customers&rsquo; desired
buying behavior. We realized it was not effective to force customers to change their behavior
to meet a purchasing process. Our first steps were to prioritize our objectives, establish our
strategies and timelines, and outline measurable goals. Next, we quickly determined what ac-
tions could reduce their current workload without risking service levels, so my team could fo-
cus on enhancing the process. Then we went into action.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Russo empowered his staffers to get the job done, then let them be. After just six months,
their progress was impressive!

<p>28 Part 1 Introduction</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>AUTOMATING THE EVERYDAY
Kerrie focused on the automated buying processes. She spent many hours at the computer,
creating an interactive purchasing website for both internal customers and suppliers. When
it&rsquo;s up and running, a new era will begin. Gone will be manual entries and multiple data in-
puts. POs being faxed across campus and then re-entered by hand into the system will fi-
nally be a thing of the past. Customer-friendly, user-driven resource pages will also be in
place. The campus will have a master supplier list with links to company websites, eliminat-
ing the time-consuming search for basic products and suppliers.
</p>
<p>The suppliers will also benefit, with access to complete information on how to do business
with Babson and forms for each online process. Best of all, every aspect of the website can
be continually refined, adapting to the appropriate circumstances. As their workload is re-
duced by automation, both the purchasing and accounts payable departments will be able to
explore new, improved ways to serve customers.
</p>
<p>CLOSING THE BACK DOOR
The underside, if you will, of Babson&rsquo;s entrepreneurial culture is the action-oriented indepen-
dence of its internal customers. Supply management channels are often overlooked by those
who believe &ldquo;we know what we want, so why do we need central purchasing?&rdquo; The result
has been multiple purchasing of single-need items, lack of safeguards, inconsistent pricing,
and contracts. Russo&rsquo;s goal? &ldquo;To maximize our department&rsquo;s ability to leverage campuswide
buying power, benchmark resources, negotiate better terms, eliminate duplicate spending,
and manage contract services.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t forgotten that faculty and staff want
maximum freedom in sourcing, so our challenge is to preserve their independence&mdash;and still
improve the way we manage the $145 million in college spending every year.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Anne put her efforts behind improving the competitively bidded buying process. She started
evaluating current campuswide strategies for products and services that were previously
made on a single-purchase basis. A great example of this is the snack vending machines.
Around the Babson campus, there are many snack vending machines. Each of these ma-
chines was purchased on an individual, as-needed basis. The result was a total of six ma-
chines, bought at six different times. More importantly, Babson received no financial
incentives, such as a percentage of sales for allowing the suppliers to put the machines on
campus. Often the machines had malfunctioning card readers&mdash;a problem Babson seemed
powerless to impact with so little supplier leverage.
</p>
<p>Taking a strategic approach, Anne re-evaluated the customer need for campuswide snack
vending. She started with a survey of the customers&rsquo; buying needs. To develop a new strat-
egy, Anne also evaluated headcounts of residents and office staff, studied traffic flow, and
benchmarked her findings against other schools. This effort culminated in a request for
quote (RFQ).
</p>
<p>An RFQ is a document provided to bidding suppliers which details exacting parameters of
the goods or services being requested. For example, an RFQ from snack suppliers might in-
clude details like number, kind, and location of vending machines; snack prices; method and
timing for refills&mdash;even issues regarding potential vandalism are covered. This provides the
suppliers with all the specifics on which to base their bids and, later, the contracts.
</p>
<p>The result is that now, Babson will have just one supplier that will manage approximately 22
machines, and a comprehensive card payment system. Babson will enjoy shared profits&mdash;
and online live tracking of snack purchases by machine!

<p>In another effort Anne developed a travel portal to help faculty, staff, and alumni access dis-
counted flight deals, hotel rates, and special promotions.
</p>
<p>Anne is also preparing the launch of a beta test for a new procurement card system, allow-
ing customers to make adjustments to a general ledger prior to posting online expenditures.
Not only will this allow users to better manage their budgets, but the time spent by the pur-
chasing department making adjustments will be reduced by over 20 hours a month.
</p>
<p>DEVELOPING NEW RELATIONSHIPS
Although the traditional college purchasing process presents both challenges and rewards,
Russo&rsquo;s enthusiasm peaks when he talks about contract services. He draws from his pre-
Babson decades and recalls that finding the right partner was crucial. Leveraging a suppli-
er&rsquo;s expertise, whether it&rsquo;s in raw materials testing or third-party fulfillment and distribution,
was a major tool in realizing success. The common perception is that outsourcing reduces sup-
ply options and service management flexibility. Russo feels differently. &ldquo;It actually increases
capabilities,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;as I can leverage the talent, skills, and assets of both Babson and
the supplier.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>As a modestly funded entrepreneur, Russo often called on suppliers to perform functions that
would traditionally go to a key department in a larger company. In order to make this &ldquo;out-
sourced/in-house operation&rdquo; effective, a cultural shift must take place. Suppliers need free-
doms and restrictions, as well as incentives and guidelines that are similar to those of an
internal department.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try never to fall into the trap of thinking that the customer is always right, or that the sup-
plier is holding out and can always do better,&rdquo; says Russo. &ldquo;Once you replace &lsquo;us&rsquo; and
&lsquo;them&rsquo; with &lsquo;we,&rsquo; the returns come in multiples!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Russo&rsquo;s relationship-building philosophy is practical and powerful:
</p>
<p>&bull; Get a tight contract agreement, stating even the most basic terms. Who gets
what, as well as when, where, and how they get it. When facts like this are un-
clear, the relationship can suffer.
</p>
<p>&bull; Set a tone of collaboration and teamwork. When suppliers realize we&rsquo;re all on the
same team, they provide revolutionary new products, enhance production meth-
ods, and even reduce their prices&mdash;voluntarily!
</p>
<p>&bull; Fight for supplier rights, protect them in company-driven experiments, help to
train their employees, and collaborate on improving their companies! In short,
make sure you understand and respect their company&rsquo;s mission, goals, and
objectives.
</p>
<p>&bull; Together create goals, measurements for success and a communication system
that assures clear and constant understanding of action steps and timing.
</p>
<p>Establishing such strong relationships with suppliers has often resulted in lifelong friend-
ships for Russo. Ironically, these friendships have made it easy to terminate professional ties
if and when the alliance is no longer working. &ldquo;Cooperation and communication at that level
insures that there&rsquo;s no mystery about performance requirements,&rdquo; Russo adds.
</p>
<p>WHAT&rsquo;S IN STORE FOR BABSON?
&ldquo;At Babson, we aren&rsquo;t experts in every field. Take dining and book sales, for example,&rdquo; says
Russo. &ldquo;In these areas, contracted service companies like Sodexo and Barnes &amp; Noble have
done a great job working with student affairs and other such departments.&rdquo;

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ldquo;These campus departments know their particular customer&mdash;the students in this case&mdash;
and they interface with suppliers as what I call &lsquo;Use Managers,&rsquo; &rdquo; continues Russo. &ldquo;They iden-
tify the need based on their observations and student comments on use. They then request
the service and challenge the supplier to propose a creative solution.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Russo likes the Use Manager model and feels it complements his role. &ldquo;My intention is to en-
hance the Use Manager model by working with the contracted service companies as a busi-
ness partner of sorts&mdash;as if we had a stake in their success, which we do!
</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my role I review detailed elements on the operational side, such as tracking equipment
life and monitoring the associated repair process and capital planning for replacement.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Russo also gets to look at the Babson customer from an operator&rsquo;s point of view. &ldquo;The great
part,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is the information these contracted service suppliers possess. They provide ac-
cess to statistical data that adds to the observation-based information we get from the Use
Managers. For example, Sodexo dining tracks how many students are served during 15-min-
ute intervals of each day and how much of each entr&eacute;e is consumed per day. My goal is to
add this type of data to information provided by our Use Managers and additional consumer
surveys and research to assure that we are providing the best food product, when, where,
and how the student desires. I can also work with suppliers to determine the benefits, risks,
and effects of various staffing options, service and materials changes, merchandising, adver-
tising, and promotion plans that they may be considering.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Russo believes that once a team approach is truly in place at Babson, &ldquo;safety positions,&rdquo; oth-
erwise known as &ldquo;sandbagging,&rdquo; will be abandoned. &ldquo;When our goals and those of our suppli-
ers are aligned, it follows that mutual benefits are at a maximum, and risk is at a
minimum,&rdquo; he says. Another benefit is that Use Managers&rsquo; operational demands are reduced
allowing them to focus energies on their customers. &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;is a definite win/
win!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Peter Russo&rsquo;s 20-plus years of experience are hard at work in his new position at Babson.
But it might be argued that his best qualifications are his three children. Two are in college
now, and a third is set to begin soon. And so the father, entrepreneur, and director of purchas-
ing wryly sums up his professional philosophy: &ldquo;Nobody understands how crucial it is to maxi-
mize the buying power of every tuition dollar more than I do!&rdquo;

<p>A Supplier&rsquo;s View of the P2P Process at a Large
Chemical Company
</p>
<p>A large chemical company was seeking to build and extend relational capital with sup-
pliers, by building trust and becoming the &ldquo;Customer of Choice.&rdquo; The capital gained through
this approach can result in preferred supplier delivery priorities, information sharing, partici-
pation on supplier councils, and other important rewards. Some important elements in becom-
ing a &ldquo;Customer of Choice&rdquo; are to enable rapid payment, provide equitable and ethical
treatment of suppliers, and focus on improving the procure to pay (P2P) process.
</p>
<p>To address some of the major problems identified by suppliers, the company interviewed sup-
pliers to identify their experiences with the current procure to pay process with some of their
major customers. The most common symptoms experienced by suppliers involve high manual
workarounds required to address problems, long cycle times for payment, no central point of
contact, and a problem with matching the purchase order (PO) and invoice.
</p>
<p>Suppliers interviewed also noted a number of root causes associated with the P2P problems.
The most common root causes were associated with the lack of a formally designed P2P pro-
cess, the lack of a central relationship management, and problems associated with supplier
interfaces with their enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Other reasons included the in-
creased complexity associated with ERP catalog and line items, and the lack of a forecast-
ing process.
</p>
<p>Suppliers believed that the fundamental root causes are the lack of a process with desig-
nated roles and specific processes; in association, different internal and external functions
are not defined. Maintenance people, buyers, planners, schedulers, accounts payable, project
planners, and others are not in synch. Further, the system is not designed to be able to with-
stand the various approaches in which people enter data and request information. When too
many people are not using the system in a unified manner, it is no wonder that the system re-
jects the input and causes problems! This points to a choice: either the tolerances of such
systems must be changed, or the manner in which the system is used must be changed.
</p>
<p>RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS
Suppliers recommended that their customers explore the following solutions: redesigning the
P2P process, developing a dedicated relationship manager to work with suppliers on key
areas of interface, exploring the use of a vendor portal using the CATS interface in SAP, and
reducing catalog items through a spend analysis to reduce the inherent complexity of enter-
ing information into the SAP system.
</p>
<p>These responses by and large provide significant insights into the problems and complexities
associated with improving the P2P cycle from a supplier&rsquo;s perspective. Unfortunately, these is-
sues also translate into significant problems for the purchasing company, which is often lost
in translation when the need for P2P improvement is communicated to a senior management
team.
</p>
<p>Late payment and excessive workaround to obtain payment in a timely manner will definitely
increase the cost to serve for companies with a broken P2P process. Some of the typical prob-
lems that can occur when a malfunctioning P2P process is not fixed include the following
events (adapted from Handfield 2006):
</p>
<p>&bull; Deteriorating response time from suppliers, which have no motivation to improve
performance and respond quickly to a customer that fails to pay them for 90
days or more S

<p>Chapter 2 The Purchasing Process 37</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A world-class purchasing staff must continuously work to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of what we call the purchasing process. This is the process used to iden-
tify user requirements, evaluate the need effectively and efficiently, identify suppliers,
ensure payment occurs promptly, ascertain that the need was effectively met, and
drive continuous improvement. The challenges in ensuring that this process occurs ef-
fectively and efficiently are the theme of this chapter. Until an organization can
streamline the day-to-day purchasing process, it will continually delay implementing
other important strategic activities that help their organization become more competi-
tive. This chapter introduces the following topics and ideas associated with purchas-
ing in multiple industries:
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchasing objectives
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchasing responsibilities
</p>
<p>&bull; E-procurement and the procure to pay process
</p>
<p>&bull; Types of purchases

<p>&bull; Purchasing process improvements

</p>
<p>Purchasing Objectives
The objectives of a world-class purchasing organization move far beyond the tradi-
</p>
<p>tional belief that purchasing&rsquo;s primary role is to obtain goods and services in re-
sponse to internal needs. To understand how this role is changing, we must
understand what purchasing is all about, starting with the primary objectives of a
world-class purchasing organization.
</p>
<p>Objective 1: Supply Continuity
Purchasing must perform a number of activities to satisfy the operational require-
</p>
<p>ments of internal customers, which is the traditional role of the purchasing function.
More often than not, purchasing supports the needs of operations through the pur-
chase of raw materials, components, subassemblies, repair and maintenance items,
and services. Purchasing may also support the requirements of physical distribution
</p>
<p>&bull; Lower service levels from suppliers, which may choose to service their more profit-
able customers first in their Cost to Serve Model
</p>
<p>&bull; Deterioration as the &ldquo;Customer of Choice&rdquo; in the minds of suppliers&rsquo; senior man-
agement, which further breaks down trust and strategic alignment
</p>
<p>&bull; Delivery delays
&bull; Higher pricing due to the cost of money that is attributed to late payment and ex-
</p>
<p>cessive personnel allocated to the account
&bull; Increased personnel on non-value-added activities (e.g., chasing payments) to the
</p>
<p>detriment of other value-added activities that can improve customer service
&bull; Loss of the supplier as a critical link in the supply chain
&bull; Higher costs internally for the purchasing company, which must also dedicate AP
</p>
<p>people and buyers to non-value-added activities

<p>centers responsible for storing and delivering replacement parts or finished products
to end customers. Purchasing also supports engineering and technical groups, particu-
larly during new-product development and outsourcing of key processes.
</p>
<p>With the dramatic increase in outsourcing, enterprises are relying increasingly on
external suppliers to provide not just materials and products, but information technol-
ogy, services, and design activities. As a greater proportion of the responsibility for
managing key business processes shifts to suppliers, purchasing must support this
strategy by providing an uninterrupted flow of high-quality goods and services that
internal customers require. Supporting this flow requires purchasing to do the
following:
</p>
<p>1. Buy products and services at the right price
</p>
<p>2. Buy them from the right source
</p>
<p>3. Buy them at the right specification that meets users&rsquo; needs
</p>
<p>4. Buy them in the right quantity
</p>
<p>5. Arrange for delivery at the right time
</p>
<p>6. Require delivery to the right internal customer
</p>
<p>Purchasing must be responsive to the materials and support needs of its internal
users (sometimes also called internal customers). Failing to respond to the needs of in-
ternal customers will diminish the confidence these users have in purchasing, and
they may try to negotiate contracts themselves (a practice known as backdoor buying).
</p>
<p>Objective 2: Manage the Purchasing Process Efficiently
and Effectively
</p>
<p>Purchasing must manage its internal operations efficiently and effectively, by per-
forming the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Determining staffing levels
</p>
<p>&bull; Developing and adhering to administrative budgets
</p>
<p>&bull; Providing professional training and growth opportunities for employees
</p>
<p>&bull; Introducing procure to pay systems that lead to improved spending visibil-
ity, efficient invoicing and payment, and user satisfaction
</p>
<p>Purchasing management has limited resources available to manage the purchasing
process and must continuously work toward improved utilization of these resources.
Limited resources include employees working within the department, budgeted
funds, time, information, and knowledge. Organizations are therefore constantly look-
ing for people who have developed the skills necessary to deal with the wide variety
of tasks faced by purchasing. Procurement people must be focused on continuously
improving transactional-level work through efficient purchasing systems that keep
suppliers satisfied, which makes life easier for internal users.
</p>
<p>Objective 3: Develop Supply Base Management
One of the most important objectives of the purchasing function is the selection,
</p>
<p>development, and maintenance of supply, a process that is sometimes described as sup-
ply base management. Purchasing must keep abreast of current conditions in supply
markets to ensure that purchasing (1) selects suppliers that are competitive, (2) identi-
fies new suppliers that have the potential for excellent performance and develops

<p>Chapter 2 The Purchasing Process 39</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>closer relationships with these suppliers, (3) improves existing suppliers, and (4) devel-
ops new suppliers that are not competitive. In so doing, purchasing can select and
manage a supply base capable of providing performance advantages in product cost,
quality, technology, delivery, and new-product development.
</p>
<p>Supply base management requires that purchasing pursue better relationships with
external suppliers and develop reliable, high-quality supply sources. This objective
also requires that purchasing work directly with suppliers to improve existing capabili-
ties and develop new capabilities. A good part of this text focuses on how purchasing
can effectively meet this objective.
</p>
<p>Objective 4: Develop Aligned Goals with Internal
Functional Stakeholders
</p>
<p>U.S. industry has traditionally maintained organizational structures that have re-
sulted in limited cross-functional interaction and cross-boundary communication.
During the 1990s, the need for closer relationships between functions became clear.
Purchasing must communicate closely with other functional groups, which are pur-
chasing&rsquo;s internal customers. These are sometimes called stakeholders, in that they
have a significant stake in the effectiveness of purchasing performance! If a supplier&rsquo;s
components are defective and causing problems for manufacturing, then purchasing
must work closely with the supplier to improve its quality. Similarly, marketing may
spend a great deal on advertising and promotion, so purchasing must ensure that the
pricing is competitive and that service-level agreements are being met. In order to
achieve this objective, purchasing must develop positive relationships and interact
closely with other functional groups, including marketing, manufacturing, engineer-
ing, technology, and finance.
</p>
<p>Objective 5: Support Organizational Goals
and Objectives
</p>
<p>Perhaps the single most important purchasing objective is to support organiza-
tional goals and objectives. Although this sounds easy, it is not always the case that
purchasing goals match organizational goals. This objective implies that purchasing
can directly affect (positively or negatively) total performance and that purchasing
must concern themselves with organizational directives. For example, let&rsquo;s assume an
organization has an objective of reducing the amount of inventory across its supply
chain. Purchasing can work with suppliers to deliver smaller quantities more fre-
quently, leading to inventory reductions. Such policies will show up as improved per-
formance on the firm&rsquo;s balance sheet and income statements. In so doing, purchasing
can be recognized as a strategic asset that provides a powerful competitive advantage
in the marketplace.
</p>
<p>Objective 6: Develop Integrated Purchasing Strategies
That Support Organizational Strategies
</p>
<p>Far too often the purchasing function fails to develop strategies and plans that
align with or support organizational strategies or the plans of other business func-
tions. There are a number of reasons why purchasing may fail to integrate their
plans with company plans. First, purchasing personnel have not historically partici-
pated in senior-level corporate planning meetings, because they were often viewed as

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>providing a tactical support function. Second, executive management has often been
slow to recognize the benefits that a world-class purchasing function can provide. As
these two conditions are rapidly changing, purchasing is being integrated within the
strategic planning process in multiple industries. A purchasing department actively in-
volved within the corporate planning process can provide supply market intelligence
that contributes to strategic planning. Effective supply market intelligence involves
the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Monitoring supply markets and trends (e.g., material price increases, short-
ages, changes in suppliers) and interpreting the impact of these trends on
company strategies
</p>
<p>&bull; Identifying the critical materials and services required to support company
strategies in key performance areas, particularly during new-product
development
</p>
<p>&bull; Developing supply options and contingency plans that support company
plans
</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting the organization&rsquo;s need for a diverse and globally competitive
supply base
</p>
<p>Purchasing Responsibilities
Functional groups carry out certain duties on behalf of the organization. We refer
</p>
<p>to this as a function&rsquo;s responsibility or span of control. Purchasing must have the legiti-
mate authority to make decisions that fall within their span of control. Span of con-
trol is established through senior management policies and support. Although
internal customers influence many important decisions, final authority for certain
matters must ultimately be assigned to the purchasing department. This section de-
tails those decision areas that are rightfully part of purchasing&rsquo;s operating authority
in most organizations. (Further details on the factors that influence how senior man-
agement determines purchasing&rsquo;s span of control are discussed in Chapter 5.)
</p>
<p>Evaluate and Select Suppliers
Perhaps the most important duty of purchasing is the right to evaluate and select
</p>
<p>suppliers&mdash;this is what purchasing personnel are trained to do. It is important to re-
tain this right to avoid maverick buying and selling&mdash;a situation that occurs when sell-
ers contact and attempt to sell directly to end users (purchasing&rsquo;s internal
customers). Of course, this right does not mean that purchasing should not request as-
sistance when identifying or evaluating potential suppliers. Engineering, for example,
can support supplier selection by evaluating supplier product and process perfor-
mance capabilities. The right to evaluate and select suppliers also does not mean that
sales representatives are not allowed to talk with non-purchasing personnel. How-
ever, non-purchasing personnel cannot make commitments to the seller or enter into
contractual agreements without purchasing&rsquo;s involvement. A trend that is affecting
purchasing&rsquo;s right to select suppliers is the use of sourcing teams with purchasing
and non-purchasing representation. The selection decision in sourcing teams requires
that the members reach a consensus in selecting suppliers.

<p>Chapter 2 The Purchasing Process 41</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Review Specifications
The authority to review material specifications is also within purchasing&rsquo;s span of
</p>
<p>control, although engineering sometimes disputes this right. Purchasing personnel
work hard to develop knowledge and expertise about a wide variety of materials but
must also make this knowledge work to an organization&rsquo;s benefit. The right to ques-
tion allows purchasing to review specifications where required. For example, purchas-
ing may question whether a lower-cost material can still meet an engineer&rsquo;s stress
tolerances. The right to question material specifications also helps avoid developing
material specifications that only a user&rsquo;s favorite supplier can satisfy. A review of dif-
ferent requisitions may also reveal that different users actually require the same mate-
rial. By combining purchase requirements, purchasing can often achieve a lower total
cost.
</p>
<p>Act as the Primary Contact with Suppliers
Purchasing departments historically have maintained a policy that suppliers have
</p>
<p>contact only with purchasing personnel. Although this makes sense from a control
standpoint, some firms today are beginning to relax this policy. Today, we recognize
that purchasing must act as the primary contact with suppliers, but that other func-
tions should be able to interact directly with suppliers as needed. Involving multiple
people enables the communication process between internal customers, purchasing,
sales, and the suppliers&rsquo; internal functions to be more efficient and accurate. Al-
though purchasing must retain the right to be the primary contact with suppliers, in-
volving other people can improve the transfer of information and knowledge
between buying and selling organizations.
</p>
<p>Determine the Method of Awarding Purchase Contracts
An important area of control is that purchasing has the right to determine how to
</p>
<p>award purchase contracts. Will purchasing award a contract based on competitive bid-
ding, negotiation, or a combination of the two approaches? If purchasing takes a com-
petitive bidding approach, how many suppliers will it request to bid? Purchasing
should also lead or coordinate negotiations with suppliers. Again, this does not mean
that purchasing should not use personnel from other functions to support the negotia-
tion process. It means that purchasing retains the right to control the overall process,
act as an agent to commit an organization to a legal agreement, and negotiate a pur-
chase price.
</p>
<p>E-Procurement and the Procure to Pay Process
In this section, we examine in detail the purchasing process, which includes all the
</p>
<p>steps that must be completed when someone within the organization requires some
product, material, or service. As stated in the chapter introduction, purchasing is a
process made up of all activities associated with identifying needs, locating and select-
ing suppliers, negotiating terms, and following up to ensure supplier performance.
These activities, or steps, are highlighted in Exhibit 2.1; this is often referred to as the
procure to pay cycle. This term includes all of the steps required, from the initial iden-
tification of requirements, to the procurement/purchasing of the item, through the re-
ceipt of the goods, and finally, to the payment of the supplier once the goods are
received.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>There are two things to keep in mind as we describe the purchasing process. First,
how much effort a company spends on these activities will differ greatly from one situ-
ation to the next. The purchasing process leading to a $30 billion contract for mili-
tary jets is very different from that for a routine purchase of office supplies!
</p>
<p>Second, as you look at the steps in the procure to pay cycle shown in Exhibit 2.1,
recognize that companies can often gain a competitive advantage by performing
these activities better than their competitors. Many organizations, for example, use in-
formation systems to automate routine purchase order preparation, whereas others
use sourcing management teams to improve the outcome of supplier evaluation and
selection efforts.
</p>
<p>This section presents the purchasing process as a cycle consisting of six major stages:
</p>
<p>1. Forecast and plan requirement
</p>
<p>2. Need clarification (requisition)
</p>
<p>3. Supplier identification/selection
</p>
<p>4. Contract/purchase order generation
</p>
<p>5. Receipt of material or service and documents
</p>
<p>6. Settlement, payment, and measurement of performance

<p>Chapter 2 The Purchasing Process 43</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>These stages may vary in different organizations, depending on whether purchas-
ing is sourcing a new or a repetitively purchased item, and also whether there is a de-
tailed approval process for purchases that exceed a specific dollar amount. New items
require that purchasing spend much more time up front evaluating potential sources.
Repeat items usually have approved sources already available. Exhibit 2.1 illustrates a
typical purchasing process used in many enterprises, with some typical contingency
elements shown.
</p>
<p>The process flow shown in Exhibit 2.1 is often called the procure to pay process,
as it documents all of the stages from the initiation of a need, through to the pay-
ment element. A document flow accompanies the movement of orders and material
throughout the procure to pay process. Historically, preparing and managing the
proper purchasing documents has been a time-consuming process. Most firms have
streamlined the document flow process to reduce the paperwork and handling re-
quired for each purchase. The suite of tools used to achieve efficiency in purchasing
transactions is broadly defined as e-procurement. Companies are using e-procurement
tools to manage the flow of documents by (1) automating the document generation
process and (2) electronically transmitting purchase documents to suppliers. The ben-
efits of electronically generating and transmitting purchasing-related documents in-
clude the following:
</p>
<p>1. A virtual elimination of paperwork and paperwork handling
</p>
<p>2. A reduction in the time between need recognition and the release and receipt
of an order
</p>
<p>3. Improved communication both within the company and with suppliers
</p>
<p>4. A reduction in errors
</p>
<p>5. A reduction in overhead costs in the purchasing area
</p>
<p>6. A reduction in the time spent by purchasing personnel on processing pur-
chase orders and invoices, and more time spent on strategic value-added pur-
chasing activities
</p>
<p>The electronic documents often used in the process are represented in Exhibit 2.1
by boxes, which we shall now discuss.
</p>
<p>Forecast and Plan Requirement
The purchasing cycle begins with the identification of a need (a requirement). In
</p>
<p>most cases, procurement personnel have an annual or biannual planning process,
whereby they will review the spending pattern for the organization (through a spend
analysis, discussed later in the chapter), and prepare a forecast of what will be pur-
chased. In some cases, there may be a whole set of new requirements that have not
been planned for (such as for new product introductions). In such cases, purchasing
personnel meet with internal customers to discuss their needs for the coming year. In
many firms today, purchasing is the primary vehicle for obtaining external inputs
(products or services) from suppliers, so that means that purchasing personnel have
to work with a large number of internal customers, which will often include market-
ing, operations, finance, information technology, and other internal customers.
Through a structured dialogue, purchasing will understand and plan for what these
customers will be buying and translate this into a forecast that is shared with suppli-
ers. (In the next chapter, we will discuss the sourcing process that takes place to iden-
tify which suppliers are to receive the business associated with fulfilling this need.)

<p>A projected need may take the form of a component (e.g., a set of fasteners), raw
material (e.g., resins), subassembly (e.g., a motor), or even a completely finished item
(e.g., a computer). In other cases, the need may be a service, such as the need to con-
tract with an ad agency for a new marketing campaign, or a food service to provide
lunches at the company cafeteria. Because purchasing is responsible for acquiring
products and services for the entire organization, the information flows between the
purchasing function and other areas of the organization can be extensive.
</p>
<p>Of course, not all needs can be forecasted ahead of time. There are situations that
arise when an internal customer has a need that comes up suddenly, which is not
planned for and for which there is no pre-existing supplier identified to provide the

analysis and decision supports span two previous years plus the current year. Each site pro-
vides six discrete data feeds: open purchase orders, receipts, rejects, unplaced demand or
forecast (demand from MRP system but not yet purchased), supplier master, and accounts
payable spend, including off-purchase order MRO spend. The seventh and eighth data feeds
capture contract manufacture bill of materials (part list) and component part approved ven-
dor list for businesses doing subcontract spend analysis.
</p>
<p>OneSource is technology agnostic, meaning Honeywell&rsquo;s business units don&rsquo;t need to change
the way they capture and store their spend data. &ldquo;Data in a specified format is taken from
the systems the site has&mdash;from Excel spreadsheets to a vast array of ERP and MRP sys-
tems, including Avalon, BPICS, Cullinet, JD Edwards, MacPac, Oracle, SAP as well as some
homegrown versions,&rdquo; says Dennis Lemon, corporate director of supplier quality and health
management. That&rsquo;s important for a diversified company like Honeywell, where procurement
is decentralized.
</p>
<p>Data classification and cleansing is done as part of project rollout and continues using data
maintenance applications administered by designated sites or business resources. &ldquo;As deploy-
ment has continued,&rdquo; Lemon says, &ldquo;data cleansing has identified up to 25% overlap with
other sites as new sites are added. Global supplier rationalization has allowed Honeywell to re-
alize supply base reductions in the 40&ndash;50% range.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Typically, according to Lemon, it takes about three months to bring a new site on board with
OneSource. A key factor has been the development of a formal process for doing this. &ldquo;We
use a defined process that specifies who we work with and how. We involve their sourcing,
IT, and quality people. We help them create data feeds, test, and validate their data, and we
train them to use the system. We really nurture them as they begin to use OneSource.&rdquo;

<p>product or service required. Such needs are often handled through a spot buy ap-
proach, which is also discussed within the context of the P2P process. For example,
marketing may need to purchase a set of pens and cups for a special promotion and
may alert purchasing on sudden notice of this need. If it was not planned for, then
purchasing must work with marketing to quickly identify a supplier to provide these
products on short notice at the lowest possible cost with an acceptable level of qual-
ity and delivery time.
</p>
<p>When creating a forecast for a needed product or service, internal customers may
not always be able to express exactly what it is they will need at a single point in
time. For example, a chemical plant maintenance group may say that they will need
replacement parts for their equipment, but they might not be able to provide details
on the exact nature of the specific parts they will need, nor the exact time they will
need them. In such cases, purchasing may negotiate agreements with distributors of
parts that can provide a whole different set of products that can meet that need. In
other cases, an internal customer may say that they need to work with a specific ser-
vice provider for temp services, consulting services, or software programming, but
they cannot express exactly what type of service they will need in advance. Purchas-
ing will then go off and attempt to secure a contract with predefined costs for differ-
ent classes of workers who can provide these services on short notice.
</p>
<p>Needs Clarification: Requisitioning
At some point, however, internal customers identify their need for a product or ser-
</p>
<p>vice and communicate to purchasing exactly what it is they need and when it is
required.
</p>
<p>Internal users communicate their needs to purchasing in a variety of ways includ-
ing purchase requisitions from internal users, forecasts and customer orders, routine
reordering systems, stock checks, and material requirements identified during new-
product development. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at these electronic (or paper) docu-
ments that communicate internal customer requirements to purchasing.
</p>
<p>Purchase Requisitions/Statement of Work
The most common method of informing purchasing of material needs is through
</p>
<p>a purchase requisition. (An example is shown in Exhibit 2.2.) Users may also transmit
their needs by phone, by word of mouth, or through a computer-generated method.
Although there are a variety of purchase requisition formats, every requisition should
contain the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Description of required material or service
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantity and date required
</p>
<p>&bull; Estimated unit cost
</p>
<p>&bull; Operating account to be charged
</p>
<p>&bull; Date of requisition (this starts the tracking cycle)
</p>
<p>&bull; Date required
</p>
<p>&bull; Authorized signature
</p>
<p>Although varieties of formats exist, at a minimum a purchase requisition should in-
clude a detailed description of the material or service, the quantity, date required, esti-
mated cost, and authorization. This form of communication for a specific need is
called a requisition. A requisition is an electronic or paper form that provides some

<p>critical information about the need. A typical requisition will provide a description of
the product (e.g., a valve), the material and color (brass, red valve), the quantity re-
quired (20 red brass valves), the intended purpose (20 red brass valves to be used in
a maintenance project for equipment XYZ), and the required date for delivery (three
weeks).
</p>
<p>Sometimes a service is required. For instance, marketing may want to purchase an
advertising campaign, R&amp;D may need a clinical trial, or human resources may need
to print a brochure. In this case, the user will complete a statement of work (SOW) that
specifies the work that is to be completed, when it is needed, and what type of ser-
vice provider is required.
</p>
<p>A standard purchase requisition or SOW is used most often for routine, noncom-
plex items that are increasingly being transmitted through online requisitioning sys-
tems linking users with purchasing. An online requisition system is an internal
system designed primarily to save time through efficient communication and track-
ing of material requests. Users should use these systems only if they require purchas-
ing involvement. It is possible that users have access to other systems that will allow
them to purchase an item directly from a supplier, such as a corporate procurement
card. In that case requisitions forwarded to purchasing are unnecessary.
</p>
<p>There are wide differences across organizations in the quality and use of electronic
purchase requisition systems. A system that simply requires users to submit to pur-
chasing what they require for electronic transmission is similar to electronic mail.
This type of system provides little added value except to speed the request to purchas-
ing. Conversely, one system studied was so complex that users were afraid to use it.
They bypassed online requisitioning and relied instead on the phone or intracom-
pany mail.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 2.3 provides further details regarding how a purchase requisition is ap-
proved, converted into a purchase order, and ultimately prepared for delivery and pay-
ment. Although the user may suggest a supplier, purchasing has final selection
authority. For routine, off-the-shelf items, the requisition may contain all the informa-
tion that purchasing requires. However, for technically complex or nonstandard
items, purchasing may require additional information or specifications with the requi-
sition. Examples of such specifications include the grade of material, method of manu-
facture, and detailed measurements and tolerances. Purchasing may send an
acknowledgment of the receipt of the purchase requisition to the requestor. This ac-
knowledgment often takes the form of a confirming order requisition. The acknowl-
edgment may be a separate form notifying the user that purchasing has received and
is processing the requisition, or it may be a copy of the original requisition. The con-
firmation verifies the accuracy of the user&rsquo;s material request.
</p>
<p>Traveling Purchase Requisitions/Bar Codes
Material needs are also communicated through a traveling purchase requisition&mdash;a
</p>
<p>form consisting of a printed card or a bar code with information about whom the item
is purchased from. This method is used primarily for very small companies that have
not automated their purchasing or inventory management processes. Information on
the card or the database entry associated with the bar code can include the following:

<p>&bull; Description of item

<p>&bull; List of approved suppliers

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Prices paid to suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Reorder point
</p>
<p>&bull; Record of usage
</p>
<p>A traveling requisition can be helpful because it can conserve time when reorder-
ing routine materials and supplies. When stock levels reach a specified reorder point,
an employee notifies purchasing by forwarding the traveling requisition maintained
with the inventory, or by electronically scanning the bar code into the ordering sys-
tem. The employee notes the current stock level and desired delivery date. To elimi-
nate the need to research information, the traveling requisition includes information
required by a buyer to process an order. This system saves time because it provides in-
formation for the item on the card (or in the database) that otherwise would require
research by a buyer. For example, the traveling requisition can include a list of ap-
proved suppliers, prices, a history of usage and ordering, and lead-time information.
Historical ordering information is noted directly on the record over a period of time.
As inventory systems continue to become computerized (even at smaller companies),
traveling requisitions are used less frequently. With an automated system, clerks sim-
ply enter the order requirement and the system generates a purchase requisition or au-
tomatically places an order.
</p>
<p>Forecasts and Customer Orders
Customer orders can trigger a need for material requirements, particularly when
</p>
<p>changes to existing products require new components. Customer orders can also sig-
nal the need to obtain existing materials. As companies increasingly customize prod-
ucts to meet the needs of individual customers, purchasing must be ready to support
new material requirements. Market forecasts can also signal the need for material.
An increasing product forecast, for example, may signal the need for additional or
new material. If a supplier is already selected to provide that material, then an auto-
mated ordering system such as a material requirements planning (MRP) system may
forward the material request to suppliers automatically.
</p>
<p>Reorder Point System
A reorder point system is a widely used way to identify purchase needs. Such a sys-
</p>
<p>tem uses information regarding order quantity and demand forecasts unique to each
item or part number maintained in inventory. Each item in a reorder point system,
which is usually computerized, has a predetermined order point and order quantity.
When inventory is depleted to a given level, the system notifies the materials control
department (or the buyer, in some organizations) to issue a request to a supplier for
inventory replenishment. This signal might be a blinking light on a screen, a message
sent to the materials control department&rsquo;s e-mail address, or a computer report.
Most reorder point systems are automated using predetermined ordering parameters
(such as an economic order quantity, which considers inventory holding and order-
ing costs). Electronic systems (such as material requirements planning systems) can
instantly calculate reorder point parameters. Most systems can also calculate the cost
tradeoffs between inventory holding costs, ordering costs, and forecast demand re-
quirements. Reorder point systems are used for production and nonproduction
items.
</p>
<p>An automated reorder point system efficiently identifies purchase requirements.
This type of system can routinely provide visibility to current inventory levels and re-
quirements of thousands of part numbers. The reorder point system is the most

<p>common method for transmitting routine material order requests today, particularly
for companies that maintain spare-part distribution centers.
</p>
<p>Stock Checks
Stock checks (or cycle counts) involve the physical checking of inventory to verify
</p>
<p>that system records (also called the record on hand, or ROH) match actual on-hand in-
ventory levels&mdash;also called the physical on-hand (POH) levels. If the physical inventory
for an item is below the system amount, an adjustment to that part&rsquo;s record can trig-
ger a reorder request for additional inventory. Why might physical inventory be less
than what the computerized system indicates should be on hand? Placing material in
an incorrect location, damage that is not properly recorded, theft, and short ship-
ments from the supplier that receiving did not notice all can contribute to the POH
being less than the ROH. For example, at one major hardware retailer, missing inven-
tory on the shelf may be located in another area of the store, or may simply be miss-
ing because of a problem with the incorrect item being entered into the system.
</p>
<p>Smaller firms that rely on standard, easy-to-obtain items often use stock checks to
determine material ordering requirements. In this environment, the stock check con-
sists of physically visiting a part location to determine if there is enough inventory to
satisfy user requirements. No purchase reorder is necessary if there is enough inven-
tory to cover expected requirements.
</p>
<p>Cross-Functional New-Product Development Teams
When users contact purchasing with a specific need, we say that purchasing is op-
</p>
<p>erating in a reactive manner. When purchasing works directly with internal custo-
mers to anticipate future requirements, such as during new-product development,
purchasing is being proactive. What does it mean to anticipate a requirement? If pur-
chasing is part of new-product development teams, then the opportunity exists to see
product designs at early stages of the process. Purchasing can begin to identify poten-
tial suppliers for expected requirements rather than reacting to an engineering require-
ment at a later date. Anticipating requirements can contribute to faster product
development cycle times and better supplier evaluation and selection. As firms con-
tinue to be forced to reduce the time required to develop new products, cross-func-
tional interaction will increasingly be the means through which organizations
identify, and hopefully anticipate, material requirements in the purchasing process
cycle.
</p>
<p>However the need is clarified, the point here is that a requisition document is com-
pleted by a requisitioner. A requisitioner is someone who is authorized by purchas-
ing to complete the needs clarification process. In some cases, the person who
expresses the need can also be the requisitioner. This occurs in cases where the sup-
plier has already been qualified, and the individual who has the need can go to a sup-
plier&rsquo;s online catalog, order the product or service directly (e.g., through Amazon),
and pay for the item using a company purchasing credit card. In such cases, the item
is typically low cost, and it is not worth the expense and trouble of completing an en-
tire requisition and going through the entire P2P cycle.
</p>
<p>Description
Within the requisitioning process, it is important to include a description of what
</p>
<p>is to be sourced. Why? If the time is not spent to describe the product or service,

<p>purchasing will have no idea of what to go out and purchase! How purchasing accom-
plishes this will differ dramatically from one situation to the next. There are a variety
of methods for communicating the user&rsquo;s requirements. Description by market grade or
industry standard might be the best choice for standard items, where the requirements
are well understood and there is common agreement between supply chain partners
about what certain terms mean. Description by brand is used when a product or service
is proprietary, or when there is a perceived advantage to using a particular supplier&rsquo;s
products or services. A builder of residential communities, for example, might tell
the purchasing staff to purchase R21 insulation, an industry standard, for walls, and
to buy finish-grade lumber, a market grade, for the trim and fireplace mantels. In ad-
dition, it might also specify brands such as Georgia-Pacific&rsquo;s Catawba&reg; hardboard sid-ing, Kohler&reg; faucets, and TruGreen-Chemlawn&reg; lawn treatment for all the homes.As you can see, brand names, market grades, and industry standards provide purchas-
ing with an effective and accurate shortcut for relaying the user&rsquo;s needs to potential
suppliers.
</p>
<p>More detailed and expensive methods of description will be needed when the
items or services to be purchased are more complex, when standards do not exist, or
when the user&rsquo;s needs are harder to communicate. Three common methods include
description by specification, description by performance characteristics, and proto-
types or samples.
</p>
<p>In some cases, an organization may need to provide very detailed descriptions of
the characteristics of an item or service. We refer to such efforts as description by speci-
fication. Specifications can cover such characteristics as the materials used, the
manufacturing or service steps required, and even the physical dimensions of the
product. Consider one extreme example: the special heat shield tiles used on NASA&rsquo;s
space shuttles. Each tile has a unique shape and location on the space shuttle. Further-
more, each shield must be able to protect the space shuttle from heat generated by
re-entry into the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. In providing a description of these tiles, NASA
almost certainly includes specifications regarding the exact dimensions of the tiles
and the composite materials to be used in making them. Such information might be
relayed in the form of detailed blueprints and supporting documentation. Further-
more, NASA likely specifies the precise manufacturing steps and quality checks to be
performed during the manufacture of the tiles.
</p>
<p>In contrast, description by performance characteristics focuses attention on the out-
comes the customer wants, not on the precise configuration of the product or service.
The assumption is that the supplier will know the best way to meet the customer&rsquo;s
needs. A company purchasing hundreds of PCs from Dell Computer might demand
(1) 24-hour support available by computer or phone, and (2) 48-hour turn-around
time on defective units. How Dell chooses to meet these performance characteristics
is its choice.
</p>
<p>Firms often develop prototypes or samples to share with their suppliers. Proto-
types can provide critical information on the look or feel of a product or service.
Such information is often difficult to convey in drawings or written descriptions.
Note that prototypes or samples are not limited to physical products. An excellent ex-
ample is a prototype information system that a company might share with potential
software vendors. The prototype may include sample output screens and reports.
Through the prototype, the company can give its software vendors a clearer idea of
how the company expects its users to interact with the system.

Snapshot
</p>
<p>Subject Matter Expert
Insights into P2P Processes
</p>
<p>As part of a research study, a number of senior procurement executives from a variety
of different industries were interviewed to get their responses to the same problems associ-
ated with the P2P cycle. Each of these individuals provided a different perspective on how to
improve the P2P process, but some common themes validated many of the vendors&rsquo; sug-
gested recommendations as well.
</p>
<p>ROBUST PROCESSES AND TRAINING
A critical element identified by all of the subject-matter experts was the need to develop stan-
dardized processes and training around the P2P process. Specifically, roles and duties of the
different people involved in the process must be clearly defined, training should emphasize
how invoices and requests should be processed, and the reasons why deviation from the pro-
cess is unacceptable and what consequences are involved with deviating from the process
should be explained. This ensures that everyone not only is compliant, but understands the
need and rationale behind the compliance. Part of the process redesign effort should also fo-
cus on simplifying processes to reduce complexity. If there is no need for a specific channel
for purchasing, then eliminate it.
</p>
<p>ON-SITE RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS
An important point that many respondents noted was the need to establish dedicated roles
around on-site relationship managers from procurement who were on site to manage in-
voices, service entries, and the like. The simple fact is that many maintenance and project
managers do not think in terms of procurement, but rather are focused on people, equip-
ment, and schedules; they do not have the time or patience required to ensure that the cor-
rect entries are put into a P2P system. The relationship manager can also act as the liaison
between the supplier and the maintenance organization, to ensure prompt payment, resolu-
tion of issues, and improvement of processes.
</p>
<p>SIMPLIFIED ONLINE PORTALS TO MINIMIZE HUMAN INTERVENTION
A number of SMEs described the need to eliminate the manual intervention of multiple un-
trained individuals in entering information into systems such as SAP. Many ERP systems
have modules for purchasing and plant maintenance, but they all require significant configu-
ration. On the other hand, a number of bolt-on packages are also available, but our SMEs ad-
vise against these because of the high probability of interface issues associated with
deployment.
</p>
<p>IMPROVE FORECASTING FOR MAINTENANCE AND PLANNING FOR EMERGENCIES
THAT CAN FLEX WITH DIFFERENT SITUATIONS THAT ARISE
The need to improve forecasting processes is a critical element in ensuring that mainte-
nance needs are met. Although maintenance is often an emergency, there are many sched-
uled maintenance activities that can be planned and communicated to suppliers. Even in
emergency situations, having a plan in place with a designated supplier can avoid many of
the problems that occur downstream in the P2P cycle. Too often, data, invoices, service en-
tries, and other key elements are entered incorrectly as a result of a fundamental lack of plan-
ning and forecasting. These elements need to be incorporated into the design of new P2P
systems.

<p>Chapter 2 The Purchasing Process 53</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Supplier Identification and Selection
Once the need and the description of the need are identified, one of two things
</p>
<p>can happen: (1) The need is fulfilled by a supplier that has an existing contractual rela-
tionship with the buying company. (2) The need is fulfilled by a new supplier that is
not currently qualified to provide products and services to the firm.
</p>
<p>In the first case, the P2P process moves quite smoothly. Through the need forecast-
ing process, purchasing personnel have already identified which suppliers will be
used to source the need, and they have already taken steps to evaluate and prequalify
the supplier. Qualification is important, as the purchasing firm must ascertain that
the supplier meets several criteria and evaluate whether it is qualified to do business
and meet the needs of their internal customers in a satisfactory manner. This evalua-
tion process is described in some detail in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>In the second case, where a supplier is not identified, or when the internal cus-
tomer requests that the need be fulfilled by a specific supplier of their choosing, pur-
chasing face a more difficult challenge. Because there is no existing contract with the
supplier, they may balk at approving the need fulfillment from this supplier. When in-
ternal customers purchase directly from nonqualified suppliers and try to bypass pur-
chasing in the process, this is known as maverick spending. That is, customers are
acting as a maverick, in that they do not wish to use suppliers already deemed by pur-
chasing as qualified to fulfill the need. Although some level of maverick spending is al-
ways going to occur in an organization, there are significant risks that can occur
when it reaches high proportions. We will discuss some of these risks later in the
chapter.
</p>
<p>Maverick spending is acceptable when there is little risk associated with the pur-
chase. For example, if someone needs to purchase a box of copy paper, there is little
risk when an internal customer goes to the local Staples store and purchases a box
using the company procurement card. In fact, purchasing will often encourage them
to do so, as this does not represent a productive use of their time in managing these
types of expenses. However, when high levels of maverick spending occur repeatedly
throughout the company, it can result in major lost opportunities to control cost and
also expose the firm to undue risk and loss of control over the purchasing process.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume for the moment that a qualified supplier is able to provide the prod-
uct or service, and that the supplier has been through the evaluation process. For
some items, firms may maintain a list of preferred suppliers that receive the first oppor-
tunity for new business. A preferred supplier has demonstrated its performance capa-
bilities through previous purchase contracts and therefore receives preference during
</p>
<p>REDUCE COMPLEXITY IN CATALOGS AND BUYING CHANNELS TO STREAMLINE
PROCUREMENT
Many of the experts also emphasized that the need to reduce complexity in the interface
systems through pre-defined procurement buying channels is critical to improving the entire
P2P cycle. There is no need for users to have multiple channels for procurement. However, es-
tablishing the credibility for users to only be able to use these channels also requires signifi-
cant management support.

<p>the supplier selection process. By maintaining a preferred supplier list, purchasing per-
sonnel can quickly identify suppliers with proven performance capabilities.
</p>
<p>In cases when there is not a preferred supplier available, purchasing must get in-
volved in selecting a supplier to fulfill that need.
</p>
<p>Final supplier selection occurs once purchasing completes the activities required
during the supplier evaluation process. Selecting suppliers is perhaps one of the most
important activities performed by companies. Errors made during this part of the pur-
chasing cycle can be damaging and long-lasting. Competitive bidding and negotiation
are two methods commonly used for final supplier selection when there is not a pre-
ferred supplier.
</p>
<p>Bidding or Negotiating?
Identifying potential suppliers is different from reaching a contract or agreement
</p>
<p>with suppliers. Competitive bidding and negotiation are two methods commonly
used when selecting a supplier. Competitive bidding in private industry involves a re-
quest for bids from suppliers with whom the buyer is willing to do business. This pro-
cess is typically initiated when the purchasing manager sends a request for quotation
(RFQ) form to the supplier. The objective is to award business to the most qualified bid-
der. Purchasers often evaluate the bids based on price. If the lowest bidder does not re-
ceive the purchase contract, the buyer has an obligation to inform that supplier why
it did not receive the contract. Competitive bidding is effective under certain
conditions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Volume is high enough to justify this method of business.
</p>
<p>&bull; The specifications or requirements are clear to the seller. The seller must
know or have the ability to estimate accurately the cost of producing the
item.
</p>
<p>&bull; The marketplace is competitive, which means it has an adequate number of
qualified sellers that want the business.
</p>
<p>&bull; Buyers ask for bids only from technically qualified suppliers that want the
contract, which in turn means they will price competitively.
</p>
<p>&bull; Adequate time is available for suppliers to evaluate the requests for
quotation.
</p>
<p>&bull; The buyer does not have a preferred supplier for that item. If a preferred sup-
plier exists, the buyer may simply choose to negotiate the final details of the
purchase contract with that supplier.
</p>
<p>Buyers use competitive bidding when price is a dominant criterion and the required
item (or service) has straightforward material specifications. In addition, competitive
bidding is often used in the defense industry and for large projects (e.g., construction
projects and information system development). If major nonprice variables exist, then
the buyer and seller usually enter into direct negotiation. Competitive bidding can also
be used to narrow the list of suppliers before entering contract negotiation.
</p>
<p>Negotiation is logical when competitive bidding is not an appropriate method for
supplier selection. Face-to-face negotiation is the best approach in the following
cases:

</p>
<p>Chapter 2 The Purchasing Process 55</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; When any of the previously mentioned criteria for competitive bidding are
missing. For example, the item may be a new or technically complex item
with only vague specifications.
</p>
<p>&bull; When the purchase requires agreement about a wide range of performance
factors, such as price, quality, delivery, risk sharing, and product support.
</p>
<p>&bull; When the buyer requires early supplier involvement.
</p>
<p>&bull; When the supplier cannot determine risks and costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; When the supplier requires a long period of time to develop and produce
the items purchased. This often makes estimating purchase costs on the part
of the supplier difficult.
</p>
<p>As firms continue to develop closer relationships with selected suppliers, the negoti-
ation process becomes one of reaching agreement on items in a cooperative mode.
One thing is certain: The process that buyers use to select suppliers can vary widely
depending on the required item and the relationship that a buyer has with its suppli-
ers. For some items, a buyer may know which supplier to use before the develop-
ment of final material specifications. For standard items, the competitive bid process
will remain an efficient method to purchase relatively straightforward requirements.
The bid process can also reduce the list of potential suppliers before a buyer begins
time-consuming and costly negotiation. Chapter 14 discusses negotiation in detail.
</p>
<p>After bids have been received or the negotiation has taken place, the sourcing
team will select a supplier and then move on to authorize the purchase through the
purchase approval process.
</p>
<p>Request for Quotation
If the requisition requests an item for a higher dollar amount with no existing sup-
</p>
<p>plier, then purchasing may obtain quotes or bids from potential suppliers. Purchas-
ing forwards a request for quotation to suppliers inviting them to submit a bid for a
purchase contract. Exhibit 2.4 presents an example of a request for quotation form.
The form provides space for the information that suppliers require to develop an accu-
rate quotation, including the description of the item, quantity required, date needed,
delivery location, and whether the buyer will consider substitute offers. Purchasing
can also indicate the date by which it must receive the supplier&rsquo;s quotation. The sup-
plier completes the form by providing name, contact person, unit cost, net amount,
and any appropriate payment terms. The supplier then forwards the request for quota-
tion to the buyer for comparison against other quotations. The normal practice is for
a buyer to request at least three quotations. Purchasing evaluates the quotations and
selects the supplier most qualified to provide the item.
</p>
<p>Specifications or Blueprints
If the requested item is complex or requires an untested or new production pro-
</p>
<p>cess, purchasing can include additional information or attachments to assist the sup-
plier. This might include detailed blueprints, samples, or technical drawings. In
addition, buyers can use requests for quotation as a preliminary approach to deter-
mine if a potential supplier even has the capability to produce a new or technically
complex item. A buyer must identify suppliers with the required production capabil-
ity before requesting detailed competitive bids. Further quotation and evaluation can
then occur to identify the best supplier.

<p>Chapter 2 The Purchasing Process 57</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If the purchase contract requires negotiation between the buyer and seller (rather
than competitive bidding), purchasing sends a request for proposal (RFP) to a supplier.
In many firms, RFQs and RFPs are synonymous. However, in the latter case, the
item&rsquo;s complexity requires that a number of issues besides price need to be included
in the supplier&rsquo;s response.
</p>
<p>Evaluate Suppliers
As shown in Exhibit 2.1, when the size of the purchase dictates that a detailed eval-
</p>
<p>uation is required for a new purchase, supplier evaluation may be required. The poten-
tial evaluation of suppliers begins after determining that a purchase need exists (or is
likely to exist) and the development of material specifications occurs. For routine or
standard product requirements with established or selected suppliers, further supplier
evaluation and selection is not necessary, and the approval process may be generated.
However, potential sources for new items, especially those of a complex nature, re-
quire thorough investigation to be sure that purchasing evaluate only qualified
suppliers.
</p>
<p>The source evaluation process requires the development of a list of potential suppli-
ers. This list may be generated from a variety of sources, including market rep-
resentatives, known suppliers, information databases, and trade journals. For some
items, companies may maintain a list of preferred suppliers that receive the first op-
portunity for new business. A preferred supplier has demonstrated capability through
past performance. Relying on a list of preferred suppliers can reduce the time and re-
sources required for evaluating and selecting suppliers.
</p>
<p>Buyers use different performance criteria when evaluating potential suppliers.
These criteria are likely to include a supplier&rsquo;s capabilities and past performance in
product design, commitment to quality, management capability and commitment,
technical ability, cost performance, delivery performance, and the ability to develop
process and product technology. These factors are weighted in the supplier evalua-
tion process. Specific examples of such weighting schemes appear in Chapter 8 on sup-
plier evaluation. Final evaluation often requires visits to supplier plants and facilities.
Because the resources to conduct such visits are limited, the purchaser must take
great care in deciding which suppliers to visit.
</p>
<p>In recent years, firms have also begun to utilize an electronic competitive bidding
tool called a reverse auction or an e-auction. These mechanisms work exactly like an
auction, but in reverse. That is, the buyer identifies potential qualified suppliers to go
online to a specific website at a designated time and bid to get the business. In such
cases, the lowest bid will often occur as suppliers see what other suppliers are bid-
ding for the business and, in an effort to win the contract, bid it lower. Although
they are somewhat ruthless, reverse auctions have been found to drive costs much
lower when there is adequate competition in a market.
</p>
<p>Approval, Contract, and Purchase Order Preparation
After the supplier is selected or a requisition for a standard item is received, pur-
</p>
<p>chasing grant an approval to purchase the product or service. This is accomplished
through several different approaches, depending on the type of system in place.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Purchase Order
The drafting of a purchase order, sometimes called a purchase agreement, takes
</p>
<p>place after supplier selection is complete. Purchasing must take great care when word-
ing a purchase agreement because it is a legally binding document. Almost all pur-
chase orders include on the reverse side of the agreement the standard legal
conditions that the order (i.e., the contract) is subject to. The purchase order details
critical information about the purchase: quantity, material specification, quality re-
quirements, price, delivery date, method of delivery, ship-to address, purchase order
number, and order due date. This information, plus the name and address of the pur-
chasing company, appears on the front side of the order. Exhibit 2.5 on p. 59 pre-
sents an example of a purchase order, and Exhibit 2.6 illustrates a typical set of
conditions and instructions.
</p>
<p>Companies with an older paper system have a cumbersome process (see Exhibit
2.3). Approximately seven to nine copies typically accompany the purchase order. In
computerized environments, a file containing a copy of the PO is sent to each depart-
ment&rsquo;s computer mailbox. The supplier receives the original copy of the purchase or-
der along with a file copy. The supplier signs the original and sends it back to the
buyer. This acknowledges that the supplier has received the purchase order and
agrees with its contents. In legal terms, the transmittal of the purchase order con-
stitutes a contractual offer, whereas the acknowledgment by the supplier constitutes a
</p>
<p>Exhibit 2.6 A Typical Set of Conditions and Instructions for a Purchase Order
</p>
<p>1. Any different or additional terms or conditions in Seller&rsquo;s (Contractor&rsquo;s) acknowledgment of this order are not binding unless ac-
cepted in writing by Buyer.
</p>
<p>2. Seller shall comply with all applicable state, federal, and local laws, rules, and regulations.
</p>
<p>3. Seller expressly covenants that all goods and services supplied will conform to Buyer&rsquo;s order; will be merchantable, fit, and suffi-
cient for the particular purpose intended; and will be free from defects, liens, and patent infringements. Seller agrees to protect
and hold harmless Buyer from any loss or claim arising out of the failure of Seller to comply with the above, and Buyer may in-
spect and reject nonconforming goods and may, at Buyer&rsquo;s option, either return such rejected goods at Seller&rsquo;s expense, or hold
them pending Seller&rsquo;s reasonable instructions.
</p>
<p>4. The obligation of Seller to meet the delivery dates, specifications, and quantities, as set forth herein, is of the essence of this or-
der, and Buyer may cancel this order and Seller shall be responsible for any loss to or claim against Buyer arising out of Sell-
er&rsquo;s failure to meet the same.
</p>
<p>5. Buyer reserves the right to cancel all or any part of this order which has not actually been shipped by Seller, in the event Buy-
er&rsquo;s business is interrupted because of strikes, labor disturbances, lockout, riot, fire, act of God or the public enemy, or any
other cause, whether like or unlike the foregoing, if beyond the reasonable efforts of the Buyer to control.
</p>
<p>6. The remedies herein reserved shall be cumulative, and additional to any other or further remedies provided in law or equity. No
waiver of a breach of any provision of this contract shall constitute a waiver of any other breach, or of such provisions.
</p>
<p>7. The provisions of this purchase order shall be construed in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the
State of Georgia.
</p>
<p>8. Government Regulations:
</p>
<p>(1) Seller&rsquo;s and Buyer&rsquo;s obligations hereunder shall be subject to all applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, execu-
tive orders, priorities, ordinances, and restrictions now or hereafter in force, including but not limited to (a) the Fair Labor
Standards Act of 1938, as amended; (b) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; (c) the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act of 1967; (d) Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (e) Executive Order 11246; (f) the Vietnam
Era Veteran&rsquo;s Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974; and the rules, regulations, and orders pertaining to the above.
</p>
<p>(2) Seller agrees that (a) the Equal Opportunity Clause; (b) the Certification of Nonsegregated Facilities required by Paragraph
(7) of Executive Order 11246; (c) the Utilization of Minority Business Enterprises and the Minority Business Enterprises Sub-
contracting Program Clauses; (d) the Affirmative Action for Handicapped Worker&rsquo;s Clause; and (e) the Affirmative Action
for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era Clause are, by this reference, incorporated herein and made a part
hereof.
</p>
<p>(3) Seller agrees (a) to file annually a complete, timely, and accurate report on Standard Form 100 (EEO-1) and (b) to develop
and maintain for each of its establishments a written affirmative action compliance program which fulfills the require-
ments of 41 C.F.R. 60-1.40 and Revised Order No. 4 (41 C.F.R. 60-2.1 et seq.).

<p>contractual acceptance. Offer and acceptance are two critical elements of a legally
binding agreement.
</p>
<p>Purchasing forwards a copy of the purchase order (either electronically or manu-
ally) to accounting (accounts payable), the requesting department, receiving, and traf-
fic. Purchasing usually keeps several copies for its records. There are good reasons
for allowing other departments to view purchase orders and incoming receipts:
</p>
<p>&bull; The accounting department gains visibility to future accounts payable obliga-
tions. It also has an order against which to match a receipt for payment
when the material arrives.
</p>
<p>&bull; The purchase order provides the requesting department with an order num-
ber to include in its records.
</p>
<p>&bull; The requestor can refer to the purchase order number when inquiring into
the status of an order.
</p>
<p>&bull; Receiving has a record of the order to match against the receipt of the mate-
rial. Receiving also can use outstanding purchase orders to help forecast its
inbound workload.
</p>
<p>&bull; Traffic becomes aware of inbound delivery requirements and can make ar-
rangements with carriers or use the company&rsquo;s own vehicles to schedule ma-
terial delivery.
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchasing use their copies of the purchase order for follow-up and monitor-
ing open orders.
</p>
<p>&bull; Orders remain active in all departments until the buying company
acknowledges receipt of the order and that it meets quantity and quality
requirements.
</p>
<p>Note that firms are increasingly using computerized databases to perform these
processes and are moving toward a paperless office.
</p>
<p>Blanket Purchase Order
For an item or group of items ordered repetitively from a supplier, purchasing
</p>
<p>may issue a blanket purchase order&mdash;an open order, usually effective for one year, cov-
ering repeated purchases of an item or family of items. Exhibit 2.7 on p. 62 provides
an example of such a form. Blanket orders eliminate the need to issue a purchase or-
der whenever there is a need for material. After a buyer establishes a blanket order
with a supplier, the ordering of an item simply requires a routine order release. The
buyer and seller have already negotiated or agreed upon the terms of the purchase
contract. With a blanket purchase order, the release of material becomes a routine
matter between the buyer and seller.
</p>
<p>Almost all firms establish blanket purchase orders with their suppliers. In fact,
blanket orders have historically been the preferred method for making the purchas-
ing process more efficient and user friendly. Buyers usually prefer a purchase order
for initial purchases or a one-time purchase, which purchasing professionals may
also call a &ldquo;spot buy.&rdquo; Blanket purchase orders are common for production items or-
dered on a regular basis or for the routine supplies required to operate. A mainte-
nance supplies distributor, for example, may have a purchase order covering
hundreds of items. It is not unusual for the buyer or seller to modify a purchase or-
der to reflect new prices, new quantity discount schedules, or the adding or deleting
of items.

<p>62 Part 2 Purchasing Operations and Structure</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The blanket purchase order is similar to the purchase order in general content
and is distributed to the same departments that receive a copy of a purchase order.
The major difference between a purchase order and a blanket purchase order is the de-
livery date and the receiving department. This information on the blanket order re-
mains open because it often differs from order to order.
</p>
<p>When negotiating a blanket purchase order, the buyer and supplier evaluate the an-
ticipated demand over time for an item or family of items. The two parties agree on
the terms of an agreement, including quantity discounts, required quality levels, deliv-
ery lead times, and any other important terms or conditions. The blanket purchase or-
der remains in effect during the time specified on the agreement. This time period is
often, but not always, six months to a year. Longer-term agreements covering several
years are becoming increasingly common with U.S. firms. Most buyers reserve the
right to cancel the blanket order at any time, particularly in the event of poor sup-
plier performance. This requires an escape clause that allows the buyer to terminate
the contract in the event of persistently poor quality, delivery problems, and so on.
</p>
<p>Material Purchase Release
Buyers use material purchase releases to order items covered by blanket purchase
</p>
<p>orders. Purchasing specifies the required part number(s), quantity, unit price, re-
quired receipt date, using department, ship-to address, and method of shipment and
forwards this to the supplier. Purchasing forwards copies of this form to the supplier,
accounting, receiving, and traffic. Purchasing retains several copies for its records.
The copy to the supplier serves as a notification of a required item or items. Account-
ing receives a copy so it can match the quantity received against the quantity ordered
for payment purposes. Receiving must have visibility of incoming orders so it can
compare ordered quantities with received quantities. As with other forms, this part of
the process is increasingly becoming electronic.
</p>
<p>Different types of material releases exist. Organizations often use the material re-
lease as a means to provide visibility to the supplier about forecasted material require-
ments as well as actual material requirements. One U.S. automobile producer
provides suppliers with an 18-month forecast for replacement parts. The first three
months of the release are actual orders. The remaining nine months represent fore-
casted requirements that help the supplier plan.
</p>
<p>In other cases, a more detailed contract is required above and beyond a simple pur-
chase order. A contract is typically required if the size of the purchase exceeds a pre-
determined monetary value (e.g., $1,000), or if there are risks associated with doing
business with a supplier where the potential for conflict and problems is not negoti-
ated prior to the purchase. Because purchasing professionals buy products and ser-
vices as a career, it is not surprising that they deal regularly with contracts. It is
therefore critical that purchasing managers understand the underlying legal aspects
of business transactions and develop the skills to manage those contracts and agree-
ments on a day-to-day basis. Once a contract has been negotiated and signed, the
real work begins. From the moment of signing, it is the purchasing manager&rsquo;s respon-
sibility to ensure that all of the terms and conditions of the agreement are fulfilled. If
the terms and conditions of a contract are breached, purchasing personnel are also re-
sponsible for resolving the conflict. In a perfect world, there would be no need for a
contract, and all deals would be sealed with a handshake. However, contracts are an
important part of managing buyer-supplier relationships as they explicitly define the

<p>roles and responsibilities of both parties, as well as how conflicts will be resolved if
they occur (which they almost always do).
</p>
<p>Purchasing contracts can be classified into different categories based on their char-
acteristics and purpose. Almost all purchasing contracts are based on some form of
pricing mechanism and can be categorized as a variation on two basic types: fixed-
price and cost-based contracts. The differences in contracts will be discussed later in
Chapter 14.
</p>
<p>Fixed-Price Contracts
</p>
<p>Firm Fixed Price
The most basic contractual pricing mechanism is called a firm fixed price. In this
</p>
<p>type of purchase contract, the price stated in the agreement does not change, regard-
less of fluctuations in general overall economic conditions, industry competition, lev-
els of supply, market prices, or other environmental changes. This contract price can
be obtained through a number of pricing mechanisms: price quotations, supplier re-
sponses to the buying organization&rsquo;s requests for proposal, negotiations, and other
methods. Fixed-price contracts are the simplest and easiest for purchasing to manage
because there is no need for extensive auditing or additional input from the purchas-
ing side.
</p>
<p>If market prices for a purchased good or service rise above the stated contract
price, the seller bears the brunt of the financial loss. However, if the market price
falls below the stated contract price because of outside factors such as competition,
changes in technology, or raw material prices, the purchaser assumes the risk or finan-
cial loss. If there is a high level of uncertainty from the supplying organization&rsquo;s
point of view regarding its ability to make a reasonable profit under competitive
fixed-price conditions, then the supplier may add to its price to cover potential in-
creases in component, raw material, or labor prices. If the supplier increases its con-
tract price in anticipation of rising costs, and the anticipated conditions do not
occur, then the purchaser has paid too high a price for the good or service. For this
reason, it is very important for the purchasing organization to adequately understand
existing market conditions prior to signing a fixed-price contract to prevent contin-
gency pricing from adversely affecting the total cost of the purchase over the life of
the contract.
</p>
<p>Cost-Based Contracts
Cost-based contracts are appropriate for situations in which there is a risk that a
</p>
<p>large contingency fee might be included using a fixed-price contract. Cost-based con-
tracts typically represent a lower level of risk of economic loss for suppliers, but they
can also result in lower overall costs to the purchaser through careful contract man-
agement. It is important for the purchaser to include contractual terms and condi-
tions that require the supplier to carefully monitor and control costs. The two parties
to the agreement must agree on what costs are to be included in the calculation of
the price of the goods or services procured.
</p>
<p>Cost-based contracts are generally applicable when the goods or services procured
are expensive, complex, and important to the purchasing party or when there is a
high degree of uncertainty regarding labor and material costs. Cost-based contracts
are generally less favorable to the purchasing party because the threat of financial
risk is transferred from the seller to the buyer. There is also a low incentive for the

<p>supplier to strive to improve its operations and lower its costs (and hence the price
to the purchaser). In fact there is an incentive, at least in the short run, for suppliers
to be inefficient in cost-based contracts because they are rewarded with higher prices.
</p>
<p>Receipt and Inspection
This phase of the purchasing cycle involves the physical transmittal of purchase re-
</p>
<p>quirements (see Exhibit 2.1 with further details in Exhibit 2.8). This should be a
fairly routine, although not necessarily the most efficient, part of the purchasing cy-
cle. Some organizations transmit orders electronically, whereas others send material
releases through the mail or by fax. Purchasing or materials planning must minimize
the time required to release and receive material. Electronic data interchange (EDI),
which involves the electronic transfer of purchase documents between the buyer and
seller, can help shorten order cycle time. EDI transactions, particularly through the In-
ternet, will increase over the next several years. Also, better relationships with suppli-
ers can support a just-in-time (JIT) ordering system. In some companies, once a
contract is negotiated, internal end users may be directly responsible for releasing ma-
terial orders covered under the terms of the contract, and purchasing personnel are
no longer involved until the contract is renewed. Exhibit 2.9 on p. 66 shows the
trend in how organizations are moving toward automating the different portions of
the procurement process.
</p>
<p>Purchasing or a materials control group must monitor the status of open purchase
orders. There may be times when a purchaser has to expedite an order or work with
a supplier to avoid a delayed shipment. A buyer can minimize order follow-up by se-
lecting only the best suppliers and developing stable forecasting and efficient order-
ing systems. The receiving process should also be made as efficient as possible by
using bar code technology to receive and place supplier deliveries in inventory.

<p>The shipping and receiving processes require several other important documents
that also can be electronic, including the material packing slip, the bill of lading, and
the receiving discrepancy report.
</p>
<p>Material Packing Slip
The material packing slip, which the supplier provides, details the contents of a ship-
</p>
<p>ment. It contains the description and quantity of the items in a shipment. It also refer-
ences a specific purchase order and material release number for tracking and
auditing purposes. A packing slip is a critical document when receiving material at a
buyer&rsquo;s facility. The receiving clerk uses the packing slip to compare the supplier pack-
ing slip quantity against the actual physical receipt quantity. Furthermore, the pack-
ing slip quantity should match the material release quantity. The comparison
between material release quantity and packing slip quantity is critical. It determines
if suppliers have over- or undershipped.
</p>
<p>Bill of Lading
Transportation carriers use a bill of lading to record the quantity of goods deliv-
</p>
<p>ered to a facility. For example, the bill of lading may state that ABC carrier delivered
three boxes to a buyer on a certain date. This prevents the purchaser from stating a
week later that it received only two boxes. The bill of lading details only the number
of boxes or containers delivered. Detailing the actual contents of each container is
the supplier&rsquo;s responsibility; that information appears on the packing slip.
</p>
<p>The bill of lading helps protect the carrier against wrongful allegations that the car-
rier somehow damaged, lost, or otherwise tampered with a shipment. This document
does not necessarily protect the carrier against charges of concealed damage, how-
ever. A user may discover concealed damages after opening a shipping container. Re-
sponsibility for concealed damage is often difficult to establish. The receiving
company may blame the carrier. The carrier may blame the supplier or maintain that
the damage occurred after delivery of the material. The supplier may maintain total

<p>innocence and implicate the carrier. While all this goes on, the buyer must reorder
the material as a rush order. This can affect customer service or commitments.
</p>
<p>Receiving Discrepancy Report
A receiving discrepancy report details any shipping or receiving discrepancies noted
</p>
<p>by the receiving department. It is often the job of purchasing or material control to in-
vestigate and resolve material discrepancies. Material discrepancies usually result
from incorrect quantity shipments. They can also result from receiving an incorrect
part number or a part number incorrectly labeled.
</p>
<p>Just-in-Time Purchasing
Just-in-time purchasing and manufacturing allows firms to eliminate most receiv-
</p>
<p>ing forms. Honda of America, for example, assumes that if its production line does
not shut down it must have received its scheduled shipments from its suppliers. The
accounts payable department makes payment unless informed otherwise. Honda&rsquo;s
JIT system eliminates the need for packing slips and inbound material inspection.
The system also eliminates the need to examine, file, and forward multiple copies of
each packing slip to various departments. If a receipt does not arrive on time or is
not damage free, Honda realizes this within minutes. With this system, no news
means the shipment arrived and is production ready.
</p>
<p>Black &amp; Decker employs a similar system called backflush accounting. In this sys-
tem, suppliers are paid only for the quantity of components that are used in each
week&rsquo;s production runs. In the event that parts are tossed aside on the production
line because of defects, Black &amp; Decker does not pay for them.
</p>
<p>Someone (typically purchasing or materials personnel) must monitor the status of
open purchase orders. There may be times when the buying firm has to expedite an
order or work with a supplier to avoid a delay in a shipment. A company can mini-
mize order follow-up by selecting only the best suppliers and developing internally sta-
ble forecasting and ordering systems. When the order for a physical good arrives at
the buyer&rsquo;s location, it is received and inspected to ensure that the right quantity was
shipped and that it was not damaged in transit. Assuming that the product or service
was delivered on time, it will be entered into the company&rsquo;s purchasing transaction
system. Physical products delivered by suppliers then become part of the company&rsquo;s
working inventory.
</p>
<p>In the case of services, the buyer must ensure that the service is being performed
according to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase order. For services, the
user will typically sign off on a supplier time sheet or other document to signal pur-
chasing that the service was delivered as promised, on time, and according to the con-
ditions stated in the initial SOW. That may mean checking with the actual users
within the organization who requested the service in the first place and ensuring that
all is going as planned. Deviations from the statement of work must be noted and
passed on to the supplier, which in some cases may require modifications to the origi-
nal PO or contracted SOW (often called a change notice when this occurs).
</p>
<p>Invoice Settlement and Payment
Once the item or service is delivered, the buying firm will issue an authorization
</p>
<p>for payment to the supplier. Payment is then made through the organization&rsquo;s ac-
counts payable department. This is increasingly being accomplished through

<p>electronic means. Suppliers are more often being paid through electronic funds transfer
(EFT), which is the automatic transfer of payment from the buyer&rsquo;s bank account to
the supplier&rsquo;s bank account. More and more organizations are moving to integrated
systems where all purchase orders, receipts, and payments are made electronically.
</p>
<p>Records Maintenance
After the product or service has been delivered and the supplier paid, a record of
</p>
<p>critical events associated with the purchase is entered into a supplier performance
database. The supplier performance database accumulates critical performance data
over an extended period, helping purchasing identify trends or patterns in supplier
performance.
</p>
<p>Why is it important to capture the transaction-level data associated with all pur-
chasing processes? This answer is discussed in the next section. Specifically, from
time to time the firm must identify opportunities for savings through a process
known as a spend analysis. Spend analysis becomes a critical input into building
sourcing strategies&mdash;the topic of the next section.
</p>
<p>Continuously Measure and Manage
Supplier Performance
</p>
<p>One way to identify the best suppliers is to track performance after awarding a con-
tract. Supplier measurement and management is a key part of the purchasing cycle.
As shown in Exhibit 2.1, buyers should not assume that the purchasing cycle ends
with the receipt of an ordered item or the selection of a supplier. Continuous measure-
ment is necessary to identify improvement opportunities or supplier nonperfor-
mance. A later chapter discusses purchasing measurement and evaluation tools. This
section simply summarizes the key points about this phase of the purchasing cycle.
</p>
<p>A desired outcome from performance measurement is improved supplier perfor-
mance. If no formal evaluation takes place, a buyer has little insight into supplier per-
formance over time, and tracking any performance improvement that results from
supplier development efforts is not possible. Without a measurement and evaluation
system, a buyer lacks the quantitative data necessary to support future purchase
decisions.
</p>
<p>A major issue when evaluating supplier performance is the frequency of evalua-
tion and feedback. For example, should a buyer receive a supplier quality perfor-
mance report on a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis? Although most firms
recognize the need to notify suppliers immediately when a problem arises, there is lit-
tle consensus about the frequency for conducting routine or scheduled supplier evalua-
tions. For many firms, this overall evaluation may occur only one or two times a
year. Regardless of the reporting frequency, supplier performance measurement is an
important part of the purchasing process cycle.
</p>
<p>Re-engineering the Procure to Pay Process
Many companies have P2P processes that are in disrepair and are focused on im-
</p>
<p>proving the P2P cycle. In re-engineering the procure to pay process, suppliers and ex-
perts recommend that executives apply the following approach:
</p>
<p>1. Secure top management support for the initiative and budgeting for the proj-
ect. Develop a list of key benefits and deliverables that will occur as a result of

<p>the improvements. Document the cost of leaving the system &ldquo;broken&rdquo; in its
current state.
</p>
<p>2. Map existing processes and problems with the P2P cycle. Identify where the
breakdowns are occurring and why they are occurring.
</p>
<p>3. Understand the needs and requirements of the user groups. Many of the peo-
ple involved&mdash;maintenance, planning, project management, supplier&rsquo;s ac-
counts payable, buyers, and so on&mdash;have specific issues that prevent them
from using the existing system. Also, many of the specific sites may have is-
sues that need to be considered in designing the new system.
</p>
<p>4. Team redesign workshops should be used to bring together key subject matter
experts (SMEs) from each of the business units. Suppliers should also be in-
vited to attend and participate, as they may have solutions they have adopted
with other customers that may prove to be efficient and simple to use (&ldquo;why re-
invent the wheel?&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>5. Explore existing technology solutions with ERP systems, as well as bolt-on ap-
plications. Map out the business requirements and ensure they are aligned
with the technology solutions that are available. Begin to estimate cost of
deployment, and ensure that adequate planning and due diligence is taken at
this step.
</p>
<p>6. Following the workshops, define the new process, and begin to pilot using a
planned technology. Ensure that it takes place in a real environment, with ac-
tual nontrained users involved in the pilot before cutting over to the next
process.
</p>
<p>7. Train and deploy other users based on the new processes and systems. Be
sure to make the training appropriate to the specific functional unit and user
groups.
</p>
<p>8. Monitor, update, and improve the system, ensuring that catalogs are kept up
to date. Hold periodic meetings with suppliers and user groups to solicit in-
put and identify problems with the systems.
</p>
<p>As technology and business requirements evolve, the P2P cycle will probably need to
be revisited from time to time to ensure it is meeting the needs of internal customers
and that suppliers are satisfied with the system.
</p>
<p>Types of Purchases
Organizations buy many different goods and services. All purchases represent a
</p>
<p>tradeoff between what an organization can make itself versus what it must buy exter-
nally. For many items, the make-or-buy decision is actually quite simple. Few firms
could manufacture their own production equipment, computers, or pencils. However,
all firms require these items to support continued operations. The challenge is decid-
ing which suppliers offer the best opportunity for items an organization must pur-
chase externally. The following sections outline the variety of goods and services a
typical purchasing department is responsible for buying. Please note that for each cate-
gory, organizations should establish measures that track the amount of goods in physi-
cal inventory.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Raw Materials
The raw materials purchase category includes items such as petroleum, coal, and
</p>
<p>lumber, and metals such as copper and zinc. It can also include agricultural raw mate-
rials such as soybeans and cotton. A key characteristic of a raw material is a lack of
processing by the supplier into a newly formed product. Any processing that occurs
makes the raw material saleable. For example, copper requires refining to remove im-
purities from the metal. Another key characteristic is that raw materials are not of
equal quality. Different types of coal, for example, can differ by sulfur content. Raw
materials often receive a grade indicating the quality level. This allows raw materials
purchases based on the required grade.
</p>
<p>Semifinished Products and Components
Semifinished products and components include all the items purchased from sup-
</p>
<p>pliers required to support an organization&rsquo;s final production. This includes single-
part number components, subassemblies, assemblies, subsystems, and systems. Semi-
finished products and components purchased by an automobile producer include
tires, seat assemblies, wheel bearings, and car frames.
</p>
<p>Managing the purchase of semifinished components is a critical purchasing respon-
sibility because components affect product quality and cost. Hewlett-Packard buys its
laser jet printer engines, which are a critical part of the finished product, from
Canon. HP must manage the purchase of these engines carefully and work closely
with the supplier. Outsourcing product requirements increases the burden on purchas-
ing to select qualified suppliers, not only for basic components, but also for complex
assemblies and systems.
</p>
<p>Finished Products
All organizations purchase finished items from external suppliers for internal use.
</p>
<p>This category also includes purchased items that require no major processing before
resale to the end customers. An organization may market under its own brand name
an item produced by another manufacturer. Why would a company purchase fin-
ished items for resale? Some companies have excellent design capability but have out-
sourced all production capability or capacity. Examples include IBM, Hewlett-
Packard, Sun, Cisco, General Motors (Geo), and others. The purchase of finished
products also allows a company to offer a full range of products. Purchasing (or engi-
neering) must work closely with the producer of a finished product to develop mate-
rial specifications. Even though the buying company does not produce the final
product, it must make sure the product meets the technical and quality specifications
demanded by engineering and the end customer.
</p>
<p>Maintenance, Repair, and Operating Items
Maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) items include anything that does not
</p>
<p>go directly into an organization&rsquo;s product. However, these items are essential for run-
ning a business. This includes spare machine parts, office and computer supplies, and
cleaning supplies. The way these items are typically dispersed throughout an organiza-
tion makes monitoring MRO inventory difficult. The only way that most purchasing
departments know when to order MRO inventory is when a user forwards a pur-
chase requisition. Because all departments and locations use MRO items, a typical

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>purchasing department can receive thousands of small-volume purchase requisitions.
Some purchasers refer to MRO items as nuisance items.
</p>
<p>Historically, most organizations have paid minimal attention to MRO items. Conse-
quently, (1) they have not tracked their MRO inventory investment with the same con-
cern with which they track production buying, (2) they have too many MRO suppliers,
and (3) they commit a disproportionate amount of time to small orders. With the devel-
opment of computerized inventory systems and the realization that MRO purchase
dollar volume is often quite high, firms have begun to take an active interest in control-
ling MRO inventory. At FedEx, an agreement with Staples allows purchasing to be free
of the burden of tracking office supply requests. Instead, Staples provides a website list-
ing all supplies with prices; users can point and click on the items they need, and the
supplier will deliver to the user&rsquo;s location the next business day.
</p>
<p>Production Support Items
Production support items include the materials required to pack and ship final
</p>
<p>products, such as pallets, boxes, master shipping containers, tape, bags, wrapping, in-
serts, and other packaging material. Production support items directly support an or-
ganization&rsquo;s production operation; this is a key distinction separating production
support and MRO items. The DaimlerChrysler sourcing snapshot in Chapter 19 pro-
vides a good example of how this activity can be managed.
</p>
<p>Services
All firms rely on external contractors for certain activities or services. An organiza-
</p>
<p>tion may hire a lawn care service to maintain the grounds around a facility or a heat-
ing and cooling specialist to handle repairs that the maintenance staff cannot
perform. Other common services include machine repair, snow removal, data entry,
consultants, and the management of cafeteria services. Like MRO items, the purchase
of services occurs throughout an organization. Therefore, there has been a tendency
to pay limited attention to them and to manage the service purchases at the facility
or department level. A study by AT&amp;T several years ago revealed that the company
was spending over a billion dollars a year on consultants. As with any purchase cate-
gory, careful and specialized attention can result in achieving the best service at the
lowest total cost. More and more, companies are negotiating longer-term contracts
with service providers just as they would with other high-dollar purchase categories.
</p>
<p>Capital Equipment
Capital equipment purchasing involves buying assets intended for use over one
</p>
<p>year. There are several categories of capital equipment purchases. The first includes
standard general equipment that involves no special design requirements. Examples
include general-purpose material-handling equipment, computer systems, and furni-
ture. A second category includes capital equipment designed specifically to meet the
requirements of the purchaser. Examples include specialized production machinery,
new manufacturing plants, specialized machine tools, and power-generating equip-
ment. The purchase of these latter items requires close technical involvement be-
tween the buyer and seller.
</p>
<p>Several features separate capital equipment purchases from other purchases. First,
capital equipment purchases do not occur with regular frequency. A production ma-
chine, for example, may remain in use for 10 to 20 years. A new plant or power

<p>Sourcing
Snapshot
</p>
<p>Microsoft: 100% Visibility
on Indirect Spend
</p>
<p>Few companies have as good a handle on their indirect spending as Microsoft. In
February 2003, the software giant began using MS Spend, a tool it developed to link data
from MS Market, its e-procurement system, with other information on the company&rsquo;s purchas-
ing activities generated by its MS Vendor and MS Invoice technologies. Now Microsoft has
100% visibility of both its global direct and indirect spends at the commodity code level.
Microsoft&rsquo;s annual purchasing tab is about $11.5 billion.
</p>
<p>Using the latest versions of its own software, Microsoft developed a series of web-based
tools to provide a user-friendly interface to its SAP ERP system. MS Market is the company&rsquo;s
electronic ordering system that creates and tracks purchase orders and captures United Na-
tions Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) categorization for purchases. MS In-
voice is its electronic invoice-processing system that allows suppliers to invoice Microsoft
electronically and track the status of invoices submitted. MS Inquire allows suppliers and in-
ternal users to pose queries about orders.
</p>
<p>MS Spend integrates information captured using MS Market and MS Invoice to provide compre-
hensive procurement reporting on the corporate intranet. Users access the tools via Internet
Explorer. Although Microsoft does not sell the tools, they are available through such company
partners as Accenture and EDS.
</p>
<p>At Microsoft, procurement has been completely paperless since 1997. Under its distributed
procurement model, all the company&rsquo;s employees are buyers of goods and services. As such,
they can purchase directly from suppliers as well as use the online procurement tools.
</p>
<p>Once the corporate procurement group slashed transaction costs to about $5 through use of
the tools, it turned its focus to strategic sourcing. &ldquo;Our goal has been to leverage more
cost-effective sourcing strategies to increase value and efficiency,&rdquo; says Don Jones, general
manager, corporate procurement. &ldquo;Spend analysis is our cornerstone.&rdquo; On the spend analysis
team with Jones are John Stevens and Jana Shull of Microsoft Corporate Procurement and
Mike Huber of Microsoft Corporate Services.
</p>
<p>After benchmarking other companies, Microsoft selected the UNSPSC as its standard commod-
ity classification system. The procurement team was looking for a coding system that it
could use not only to classify spend, but also to communicate with its trading partners. Devel-
oping an internal system, Jones says, &ldquo;would hamper our ability to communicate through our
e-procurement system with our supply base.&rdquo; The company&rsquo;s hardware suppliers, for in-
stance, all use the same version of the UNSPSC code.
</p>
<p>To ensure accurate reporting of spend data, Microsoft invested in additional technology that
guides buyers to select proper codes for goods and services they purchase through MS Mar-
ket. After more benchmarking, the corporate procurement team learned that other UNSPSC
users said requisitioners typically don&rsquo;t make the effort to ensure they are using correct
codes when placing orders, typically selecting one of the first codes appearing on a list. In
UNSPSC code, one of the first codes is for sheep. Once procurement teams ran reports on
spend, they learned only that requisitioners in their companies were purchasing a lot of
sheep.

<p>Jones was determined that this would not be the case with buyers at Microsoft. As such, the
team incorporated a logical selection into its ordering system. The system is designed to
host a subset of UNSPSC codes based on the supplier selected by the buyer. As part of theS

<p>substation may remain in operation over 30 years. Even office furniture may last
over 10 years. A second feature is that capital equipment investment requires large
sums of money. This can range from several thousand dollars to hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars. High-dollar contracts will require finance and executive approvals.
For accounting purposes, most capital equipment is depreciable over the life of the
item. Finally, capital equipment purchasing is highly sensitive to general economic
conditions.
</p>
<p>Buyers can rarely switch suppliers in the middle of a large-scale project or dispose
of capital equipment after delivery because of dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the rela-
tionship between the buyer and supplier may last many years, so the buyer should
also consider the supplier&rsquo;s ability to service the equipment. The consequences of se-
lecting a poorly qualified supplier of capital equipment can last for many years. The
reverse is also true. The benefit of selecting a highly qualified capital equipment pro-
vider can last many years.
</p>
<p>Transportation and Third-Party Purchasing
Transportation is a specialized and important type of service buying. Few purchas-
</p>
<p>ing departments involved themselves with transportation issues before the early
1980s. However, legislation passed during the late 1970s and early 1980s deregulated
the air, trucking, and railroad industries. This legislation allowed buyers to negotiate
service agreements and rate discounts directly with individual transportation carriers.
Previously, the U.S. government, through the Interstate Commerce Commission, es-
tablished the rate (referred to as a tariff) that a transportation carrier charged. It was
common for suppliers to arrange shipment to a purchaser and simply include the
transportation cost as part of the purchase cost.
</p>
<p>Purchasing personnel have become involved with transportation buying and the
management of inbound and outbound material flows. It is now common for purchas-
ing personnel to evaluate and select logistics providers the same way they evaluate
and select suppliers of production items. Buyers are also selecting suppliers that are ca-
pable of providing coordinated transportation and logistics services for an entire com-
pany, including warehousing, packaging, and even assembly. Because many carriers
now provide service throughout the United States, a buyer can rely on fewer transpor-
tation carriers. The cost savings available from controlling and managing logistics are
significant.
</p>
<p>ordering process, the buyer discretely identifies the good or service at the transaction level.
The buyer is given a targeted selection to choose from based on supplier selected. &ldquo;This infor-
mation is integrated for our analysis as well as passed to our reporting tools,&rdquo; Jones says. Al-
though the team has a process to randomly check codes, it doesn&rsquo;t cleanse the data; &ldquo;no
one knows better what they are ordering than the buyers themselves,&rdquo; he adds. Corporate pro-
curement uses an online video to train buyers not only on how to use the codes, but also to ex-
plain the benefits gained by Microsoft by their doing so.

<p>Improving the Purchasing Process
Most companies spend too much time and too many resources managing the or-
</p>
<p>dering of goods and service, particularly lower-value items. Some purchasing depart-
ments spend 80% of their time managing 20% of their total purchase dollars. Recent
research on maintenance, repair, and operating purchases reported that while the av-
erage MRO invoice was $50, the total cost of processing an MRO transaction was
$150.1 In another example, a U.S. government agency reported that in a single year it
processed 1.1 million transactions at an estimated cost of $300 per transaction! How
can organizations create value through their purchasing process when they spend
more time processing orders than what the orders are worth?
</p>
<p>A recent study by Trent and Kolchin2 addressed how organizations are improving
the purchasing process by reducing the time and effort associated with obtaining
lower-value goods and services. The study involved 169 randomly selected organiza-
tions, of which 77 are industrial companies and 92 are nonindustrial companies or or-
ganizations. Exhibit 2.9 identifies the methods or approaches that organizations
expect to emphasize over the next several years to improve the low-value purchasing
process. The following sections summarize the approaches and methods presented in
the exhibit.
</p>
<p>Online Requisitioning Systems from Users to Purchasing
Online requisitioning systems are internal systems designed primarily to save time
</p>
<p>through efficient and rapid communication. Users should use these systems only if
they require purchasing involvement to support a material or service need. If users
do not require assistance, they should have access to other low-dollar systems that do
not require purchasing involvement.
</p>
<p>Advanced organizations are much more likely to allow users to request low-value
purchases through internal electronic systems when the need requires purchasing in-
volvement. Organizations that have made less progress managing low-value purchas-
ing use company mail or the phone to receive user requests. Users should rely on
efficient requisitioning systems for items that require purchasing involvement. A lon-
ger-term focus should be to create systems and processes that empower users to ob-
tain low-value items directly from suppliers rather than involving purchasing.
</p>
<p>Procurement Cards Issued to Users
One tool or system that most organizations agree is central to improving the pur-
</p>
<p>chasing process is the use of the procurement card, which is essentially a credit card
provided to internal users. When users have a lower-value requirement, they simply
contact a supplier and use the card to make the purchase. Cards work well for items
that do not have established suppliers or are not covered by some other purchasing sys-
tem. The users make the buying decisions (the money for which comes out of their de-
partment&rsquo;s budget) and bypass purchasing completely. The dollar value of the items
covered by procurement cards is relatively low. The cost to involve purchasing or en-
gage in a comprehensive supplier search would likely outweigh the cost of the item.
</p>
<p>The study by Trent and Kolchin found that the average cost per transaction due
to procurement card use decreased from over $80 to under $30. The primary benefits
from using cards include faster response to user needs, reduced transaction costs,
and reduced total transaction time. In most organizations, purchasing is responsible
for introducing and maintaining the card program.

<p>Electronic Purchasing Commerce through the Internet
Electronic purchasing commerce through the Internet refers to a broad and di-
</p>
<p>verse set of activities. Using the Internet to conduct purchasing business is not exten-
sive today, although commercial Internet usage by purchasers should increase
dramatically over the next several years. The highest expected growth areas in e-com-
merce purchasing include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Transmitting purchase orders to suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Following up on the status of orders
</p>
<p>&bull; Submitting requests for quotes to suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Placing orders with suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Making electronic funds transfer payments
</p>
<p>&bull; Establishing electronic data interchange capability
</p>
<p>Longer-Term Purchase Agreements
Longer-term purchase agreements usually cover a period of one to five years, with
</p>
<p>renewal based on a supplier&rsquo;s ability to satisfy performance expectations. These agree-
ments can reduce the transactions costs associated with lower-value purchases by
eliminating the need for time-consuming annual renewal. Furthermore, once a pur-
chaser and a supplier reach agreement, material releasing responsibility should shift
to user groups. Ideally, material releasing becomes electronic rather than manual,
even for lower-value items.
</p>
<p>Although the two approaches are conceptually similar, differences exist between a
blanket purchase order, which purchasers routinely use, and longer-term purchase
agreements. Both approaches rely on a contractual agreement to cover specific items
or services; they may be for extended periods; they are legal agreements; and they are
highly emphasized ways to manage lower-value purchases. However, blanket pur-
chase orders are typically used more often for lower-value items than for longer-term
agreements. Longer-term agreements are usually more detailed in the contractual
areas they address compared with blanket purchase orders.
</p>
<p>Online Ordering Systems to Suppliers
Online ordering systems involve direct electronic links from a purchaser&rsquo;s system
</p>
<p>to a supplier&rsquo;s system, often through a modem or other web-enabled technologies. A
major feature of online ordering systems is that suppliers often bear the responsibil-
ity for developing the software required to link with a customer&rsquo;s system. Online or-
dering is a logical approach once an organization has established a blanket purchase
agreement or longer-term contract with a supplier. The strategic part of the sourcing
process involves identifying, evaluating, and selecting suppliers. Online ordering sys-
tems allow purchasing or users to place orders directly into a supplier&rsquo;s order-entry
system. Advantages of online ordering systems include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Immediate visibility to back-ordered items
</p>
<p>&bull; Faster order input time, which contributes to reduced order cycle times
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduced ordering errors
</p>
<p>&bull; Order tracking capabilities S

<p>Sourcing
Snapshot
</p>
<p>IBM: Closing the Loop
on Spend
</p>
<p>The real strength in IBM&rsquo;s spend-analysis system lies with its cyclical&mdash;as opposed to
linear&mdash;approach to strategic planning and sourcing. It lies also with IBM&rsquo;s organizational
and corporate governance structures.
</p>
<p>Through governance, IBM limits the ways in which people can spend money. External commit-
ment requires a PO, and old spending loopholes&mdash;like check requests, wire transfers, and ex-
pense accounts&mdash;are closely controlled, according to Bill Fanning, director of procurement
finance, who reports directly to IBM&rsquo;s finance organization and indirectly to chief procure-
ment officer John Paterson.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no escape route,&rdquo; Fanning says. &ldquo;Our system detects and reports anyone who by-
passes the procurement system every time they do it. If a person comes to us with an in-
voice in hand, we say, &lsquo;Okay, we&rsquo;ll pay, but we have to set up a PO.&rsquo; That creates an
immediate report to their manager. If they do it a second time, they receive an official repri-
mand. If they do it a third time, they&rsquo;re subject to dismissal. People have been fired.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>IBM captures spend data in real time at two different points: when money is committed (of-
ten 30&ndash;60 days before it is paid out) and again when money goes out the door. Planned re-
finements to the system will capture even more forward-looking demand data earlier in the
decision cycle.
</p>
<p>After capturing its spend data, IBM classifies it automatically using a proprietary, highly gran-
ular taxonomy and closes the procurement-to-finance loop by mapping corporate spend data
&mdash;which is organized by commodity, supplier, etc.&mdash;to the various brands&rsquo; and business-
units&rsquo; accounting ledgers. &ldquo;Financial folks are not really interested in how a commodity is de-
fined,&rdquo; explains Fanning. &ldquo;They understand the ledger. By building a bridge between procure-
ment&rsquo;s taxonomy and the ledger&rsquo;s taxonomy, we have created an ability to really manage
spend and to affect our business units&rsquo; profit and loss (P&amp;L) statements.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>But IBM doesn&rsquo;t stop there. The company also has the ability to associate spend data with
other procurement information such as competitive cost (IBM&rsquo;s historical cost curve com-
pared to an industry benchmark cost curve), absolute lowest cost, and other competitive com-
modity market intelligence gathered routinely by its 31 sourcing councils. &ldquo;Fundamentally,
the only reason procurement has a reason to exist is to develop a competitive advantage,
but you have to be able to measure that,&rdquo; Fanning says.
</p>
<p>IBM&rsquo;s spend analysis structure allows the procurement organization to do the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Forecast what the company will spend over the coming year and how the spend
will break down by business unit
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide an outlook as to what is likely to happen with commodity market pricing
&bull; Report how sourcing councils will deliver savings to specific IBM brands or busi-
</p>
<p>ness units
&bull; Plan with brand managers or business units how they will deploy expected sav-
</p>
<p>ings (either &ldquo;take down&rdquo; or invest elsewhere) in their P&amp;Ls
&bull; Close the loop by measuring performance to plans
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spend data is used in tracking monthly performance of all (31) commodity councils and the
global procurement organization,&rdquo; says Fanning. &ldquo;The data provides a direct link to the profit
and loss metrics of each brand and group within IBM.&rdquo;

<p>&bull; Order acknowledgment from the supplier, often with shipping commitment

</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to batch multiple items from multiple users on a single online order
</p>
<p>&bull; Faster order cycle time from input to delivery
</p>
<p>Suppliers establish online ordering systems so purchasers can have dedicated ac-
cess to the supplier&rsquo;s order-entry system. The system creates a seamless tie-in or link-
age between organizations. Third-party software providers such as Ariba provide
turnkey solutions that will help to further this development in the future.
</p>
<p>Purchasing Process Redesign
Most organizations recognize that purchasing process redesign efforts often pre-
</p>
<p>cede the development of low-dollar purchase systems. Properly executed redesign ef-
forts should lead to faster cycle times and simplified processes that result in reduced
transactions costs.
</p>
<p>The purchasing process is composed of many subprocesses, which means it can
benefit from process mapping and redesign. The low-value purchase process affects
hundreds or even thousands of individuals throughout a typical organization&mdash;users
in every department, office, plant, and facility; accounts payable; receiving and han-
dling; purchasing; systems; and of course, suppliers. Anyone with a need for low-
value goods or services is part of the low-value purchase process.
</p>
<p>Electronic Data Interchange
Electronic data interchange involves a communications standard that supports in-
</p>
<p>terorganizational electronic exchange of common business documents and informa-
tion. It is a cooperative effort between a buyer and seller to become more efficient by
streamlining communication processes. When used by buyers and suppliers, EDI can
help eliminate some steps involved in traditional communication flows, which re-
duces time and cost.
</p>
<p>Although actual volumes through EDI have increased through the 1990s, actual
EDI volume does not match the expected volume that was projected by companies.
In 1993, for example, purchasing professionals estimated that 60% of the supply base,
70% of total purchase dollars, and 65 percent of total purchasing transactions would
flow through EDI systems. Actual 1997 volume was 28% of suppliers, 38% of total
purchase dollars, and 32% of total purchasing transactions flowing through EDI sys-
tems.3 Part of this shortfall is due to the introduction of auto fax technology. For
many organizations, especially smaller organizations, auto fax is a quicker and less ex-
pensive method of communicating with suppliers. Auto fax systems automatically fax
requirements to suppliers once those requirements are known by the buyer. The Inter-
net also captures electronic volume that formerly would have passed through third-
party EDI providers. Chapter 19 discusses this important topic in greater detail.
</p>
<p>Online Ordering through Electronic Catalogs
Purchasers are increasingly using this approach in conjunction with other low-dol-
</p>
<p>lar purchase systems. For example, one organization allows its user to identify supply
sources through the Internet and then use a procurement card to process the order.
The key benefit of using electronic catalogs is their powerful low-cost search capabil-
ity and, if users order directly instead of relying on purchasing, reduced total cycle

<p>time and ordering costs. Perhaps the greatest drawback to online ordering is the lim-
ited number of suppliers that offer electronic catalogs, along with questions about se-
curity of electronic ordering and control issues.
</p>
<p>Allowing Users to Contact Suppliers Directly
This general method or approach involves different kinds of low-dollar systems.
</p>
<p>Procurement cards technically qualify as a system that allows users to contact suppli-
ers directly. Online ordering systems also allow users to contact suppliers directly, or
the system may involve nothing more than a multiple part form, such as a limited pur-
chase order, that users complete as they initiate an order. FedEx refers to its &ldquo;pick up
the phone&rdquo; system, which allows users to contact suppliers directly, as its convenience
ordering system.
</p>
<p>Approaches that allow users to contact suppliers directly shift responsibility for
the transaction from purchasing to the user. Even for items with no established sup-
plier, purchasing still may have limited or no involvement unless the requirement
reaches a predetermined dollar or activity level. If an item becomes a repetitive pur-
chase, then purchasing may determine if the item warrants a blanket purchase order.
Blanket purchase orders usually allow users to contact suppliers directly when a need
arises for material. The following Good Practice Example describes a system that al-
lows users to contact suppliers directly below some dollar threshold level.
</p>
<p>Why is it important to capture the transaction-level data associated with all ele-
ments of the P2P process? This answer is discussed in Chapter 6 on sourcing strat-
egy. Specifically, from time to time the firm must identify opportunities for savings
through a process known as a spend analysis. A spend analysis becomes a critical in-
put into building sourcing strategies, the topic of Chapter 6.

<p>Good Practice
Example

Federal Express
</p>
<p>FedEx Corporation is a $20 billion market leader in transportation, information, and lo-
gistics solutions, providing strategic direction to six main operating companies. These are
FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Custom Critical, FedEx Trade Networks,
and FedEx Services.
</p>
<p>THE FEDEX CENTER-LED INITIATIVE
Prior to the purchase of the Ground, Freight, and other non-express-based services, Federal Ex-
press had reorganized all of its major indirect spend in information technology, aircraft, facili-
ties/business services, vehicles/fuel/ground service equipment, and supply chain logistics
groups under the Strategic Sourcing and Supply group, led by Edith Kelly-Green. After the pur-
chase of these different businesses, the supply management function was reorganized into a
Center-led supply chain management (SCM) sourcing model. (&ldquo;Center&rdquo; refers to a Center of
Excellence that focuses on centralizing sourcing strategy teams.) Over the last two years,
FedEx Supply Chain Management has been focusing on leveraging sourcing and contracting
for all of the FedEx family of companies. For office supplies, instead of having each company
run a contract, SCM has a single corporate contract for all of the negotiation effort that al-
lows for different transactional approaches. It has been a gradual migration to a centralized

<p>view of how procurement happens. It is central for the larger spend areas and different pol-
icy requirements.
</p>
<p>THE SOURCING PROCESS
FedEx established a seven-step sourcing process, shown in Exhibit 2.10 on p. 81.
</p>
<p>Step 1: A user provides a requisition for an item. When the user provides the requisition, the
sourcing specialist or team must establish whether it is worth putting a strategy around it.
This is typically done using a return-on-investment criterion: Is the spend large enough to
put a significant amount of time into sourcing the product through a full-blown supplier evalu-
ation? For example, if the requisition is for something that turns out to be a $200,000 per
year spend, the payback on it may not be worth the resources required to do a full supplier
evaluation and selection process. However, if the spend is large enough, the team will con-
duct an assessment of the category that profiles that industry and commodity. This assess-
ment involves researching the nature of existing purchasing activity: How much is it, who is
it with, and what are the issues with existing suppliers? If it is not large enough, the user
may be directed to a simple purchase order and invoice through the Ariba system.
</p>
<p>Step 2: Assuming a large spend, based on research conducted in Step 1, the team goes into
a process to select the sourcing strategy, in essence taking all of the information it has and
deciding how it will approach that marketplace. Is a request for proposal appropriate? Does
it need to maintain existing relationships or revisit negotiation and develop a strategy regard-
ing the sourcing strategy?
</p>
<p>Step 3: Assuming it is going beyond a negotiation, the team must conduct in-depth research
with suppliers in that area, including qualification of the suppliers. Can the suppliers satisfy
user requirements, service aspects, and so on? The end goal is to develop a list of suppliers
to send RFPs to. The team conducts a supplier portfolio analysis.
</p>
<p>Step 4: Another phase of this implementation pass is to revisit this strategy and have the
team take another look at it. Has it uncovered something that will cause it to change negotia-
tion? The team develops a strategy for negotiation; does it want to use a reverse auction or
use a conventional RFP, as well as criteria for supplier evaluation? Is this still something it
wants to do? If so, it proceeds with the RFP to the selected suppliers.
</p>
<p>Step 5: After receiving RFPs, the team conducts the supplier selection and negotiation
process.
</p>
<p>Step 6: Once the team has made the selection, it needs to do the integration. This is done
by applying the Ariba toolset with the supplier and identifying integration conflicts to be
resolved to make the contract workable.
</p>
<p>Step 7: The final stage in this process is to benchmark the supply market by monitoring the
supplier(s) through the FedEx Supplier Scorecard system.
</p>
<p>E-procurement tools through the Ariba Buyer system play a big role in the process. For exam-
ple, users who need a PC can select one online and requisition it. Depending on the busi-
ness rules governing authority threshold, the user may need a supervisor&rsquo;s authorization and
may need higher-level approval as well. If the spend goes into the capital range, there is an-
other set of approval rules to ensure that people who oversee capital purchases also approve
it. It also draws on the business rules from the IT group, which may be a different set of
rules. Business rules are established within Ariba Buyer depending on the category of spend
taking place. The types of controls made on purchases will vary. Once those approvals are
completed, it releases out to the supplier. S

</p>
<p>Chapter 2 The Purchasing Process 79</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In Ariba, users have an online catalog for contracts that are in place; several thousand office
supplies are set up on the catalog. Requisitioners can find what they want, and once submit-
ted, the requisition is bounced against a purchase approval policy. Requisitioners can also
use an RFP before they initiate the sourcing process. One of the first things they will do is
get a handle on accounts payable information using Ariba to identify the largest suppliers
and establish prior sales to FedEx with information on line items. Ariba Buyer also tracks re-
ceipts. Because FedEx receives products and services at many different locations around the
globe, all employees have an obligation to enter a receipt into the system when the shipment
arrives or the service is performed, which generates an acknowledgment and a matching in-
voice on the system. If an individual does not receive the product or service, Ariba will de-
velop e-mail reminders that will eventually escalate to senior management if left
unattended.
</p>
<p>The value of using a single e-procurement system is that if FedEx supply management de-
cides to implement a change on the control levels, it is easy to do across the company using
the system. For example, if the CEO mandates a spending freeze (no PCs without VP-level ap-
proval), SCM can change the business rules on the system. FedEx also uses ELAMS, another
information system for temp labor contract programmers. The ELAMS system allows online
requisitions for contract programmers or temp labor based on contracts that are in place&mdash;it
controls the rate and type of individual sent out by that company and can approve the in-
voices online. It can also ensure that the skill level of temp labor FedEx is paying for is
matched to the skill level of the individual actually doing the work. This enables FedEx to con-
trol the type of person that it actually pays for, delivering both value and cost savings to the
bottom line.
</p>
<p>This example illustrates that improving the purchasing process in terms of efficiency and ef-
fectiveness requires more than one single system or approach. Purchasing, accounts payable,
user groups or departments, and those responsible for handling inventory and material can
all benefit from a systematic approach to improving how goods and services flow into an
organization.

trol, the purchasing cycle, and the documents used to manage the purchasing
process. These topics provide the foundation from which to introduce the tools, tech-
niques, and strategies used by purchasing organizations in a competitive market.
</p>
<p>This chapter also points out the many different categories of purchases. In addi-
tion to buying production material and items, purchasing can be responsible for buy-
ing transportation, services, packing supplies, MRO items, capital equipment, and
even the corporate jet! There is no one system or approach that applies to all pur-
chase situations. Purchases can vary according to type, importance, impact on quality,
time frame for delivery, and dollar volume. We rarely find purchasing personnel who
are experts in all the different types of purchases, which is why so many purchasing
departments have specialized personnel. These personnel all have one thing in com-
mon, however: the opportunity to manage large amounts of resources through the pur-
chasing process. By utilizing e-procurement tools, purchasing can achieve the goals of
satisfying user requirements, minimizing non-value-added time, and focusing on
deployment of sourcing strategies that can provide tangible value to their enterprise.

<p>Developing a Policies and Procedures Manual in a
Decentralized Cement Company
</p>
<p>A U.S.-based cement company that is a global leader in cement, building materials, re-
lated technologies, and research recently decided to redesign its procurement organization
and recognized that policies and procedures were an important part of this process. The com-
pany consists of several cement operations located in one region of the United States. Each
operation had established decentralized procurement processes. Although the basic manu-
facturing processes are not dissimilar, there existed a variety of supply strategies, approved
suppliers, and procurement channel strategies.
</p>
<p>In 1999, the company developed a purchasing policies and procedures manual to define
guidelines by which the purchasing function would be practiced at the company.
</p>
<p>In January 2007, an external team of experts completed a procure to pay (P2P) assessment
of the company, focusing on the requisition to payment process. The key objective was to iden-
tify opportunities to improve user satisfaction and transactional efficiency such that the pro-
curement staff could shift their efforts from pushing transactions through the system to
strategic sourcing and contracting activities.
</p>
<p>The study was concluded and presented in early February 2007. One of the recommendations
made by the team was to enhance the current process; improvements were needed to elimi-
nate or reduce current issues and reduce the purchase order cycle time for a tighter distribu-
tion, thus reducing the mean cycle time and the effort to achieve this.
</p>
<p>In order to begin the multiple improvement efforts needed to accomplish this, the senior exec-
utive team, composed of IT, procurement, maintenance, and operations departments, recog-
nized that it was necessary to first re-establish a common and consistent baseline of
beliefs, methods, and behaviors across all of the company&rsquo;s facilities. The purchasing poli-
cies and procedures manual was a good start, but the manual had not been updated since
the time of publication. There was a strong need to educate, train, and monitor compliance
with policies and procedures. The eight-year-old manual was also in need of review and revi-
sion to capture changes in organizational structure from a decentralized environment to a cen-
tralized procurement environment and to reflect the changing set of strategies and practices
that impacted the currently accepted business practices.
</p>
<p>In addition to the much-needed update, two additional purposes for a policies overhaul were
recognized. The first was to set the stage for a concentrated effort to educate employees so
that they would comply with policies and procedures. Second, the new policies and proce-
dures manual would serve as the basis for development of a worldwide corporate procure-
ment governance model.
</p>
<p>In order to successfully accomplish these goals, a team was chartered to review and update
the present documents and address current pain points. The stated goal was the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; To revise the current procurement policies and procedures documents to reflect
current practices and to relieve pain points and areas of confusion
</p>
<p>&bull; To develop a document management strategy, including centralized location, easy
accessibility to stakeholders and users, regular review of documents for neces-
sary changes/updates, and a notification method for new or revised documents
</p>
<p>&bull; To establish ownership within Central Procurement and establish processes to en-
sure companywide compliance
</p>
<p>The end deliverable will be an updated policies and procedures manual that is accessible on-
line, in compliance with global directives, and available in a common web-based policies
and procedures template.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The opening vignette illustrates an important point about purchasing policies: From
time to time, it is important to review them and update them as required! Because
the company&rsquo;s environment is constantly changing, there is a need to keep up with
these changes and provide guidelines and directions to employees regarding how
these changes will impact their ways of working. Policies provide the basis for action
on the part of sourcing professionals, as well as a set of guidelines for the appropriate
way to deal with new situations. As the purchasing and technology environment
changes, policies and procedures must be kept up to date with these changes.
</p>
<p>Most organizations have a set of policies outlining or detailing the directives of ex-
ecutive management across a range of topics. These directives provide guidance while
at the same time placing operating constraints on personal behavior. This chapter, di-
vided into three major sections, discusses the role of purchasing policy and proce-
dures in today&rsquo;s business environment. The first section provides a general overview
and discussion of policy. This includes defining policy, the characteristics of an effec-
tive policy, the advantages and disadvantages of policy, and the policy hierarchy. The
second section focuses on specific categories of purchasing policies, with a special em-
phasis on one area known as maverick spending. The third section presents purchas-
ing procedures, which are operating instructions detailing functional duties and tasks.
</p>
<p>Policy Overview
The term policy includes all the directives, both explicit and implied, that desig-
</p>
<p>nate the aims and ends of an organization and the appropriate means used in their
accomplishment.
</p>
<p>Policy refers to the set of purposes, principles, and rules of action that guide an or-
ganization.1 Rules of action refer to standard operating procedures along with any
rules and regulations. Although policies are usually documented in writing, unwritten
or informal policies can also exist. Informal policies are understood over time and
eventually become part of an organization&rsquo;s culture.
</p>
<p>What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages
of Policies?
</p>
<p>Having written and implied policies is an opportunity to define and clarify top
management objectives. Policy statements are a means for executive management to
communicate its leadership and views. Executive management should develop a se-
ries of high-level policy statements that provide guidance to employees at all levels.
</p>
<p>Another advantage is that policies provide a framework for consistent decision
making and action. In fact, one of the primary objectives of a policy is to ensure that
personnel act in a manner consistent with executive or functional management&rsquo;s ex-
pectations. Finally, an effective policy provides an additional advantage by defining
the rules and procedures that apply to all employees.
</p>
<p>There are also potential disadvantages to policy development. First, a policy is of-
ten difficult to communicate throughout large organizations. Second, employees
might view policies as a substitute for effective management. Policy statements are
guidelines that outline management&rsquo;s belief or position on a topic. They are not a set
of how-to instructions designed to provide specific answers for every business deci-
sion. Third, policy development can also restrict innovation and flexibility. Too many

<p>policies accompanied by cumbersome procedures can become an organization&rsquo;s
worst enemy.
</p>
<p>What Makes for an Effective Policy?
Several characteristics of a policy render it effective. Effective policies are action-ori-
</p>
<p>ented guidelines that provide guidance. They provide enough detail to direct behav-
ior toward a specific goal or objective but are not so detailed that they discourage
personnel from following the policy.
</p>
<p>An effective policy is relevant (avoiding trivial or unimportant issues) and concise
(stating a position with a minimum number of words). An effective policy is unambig-
uous, allowing personnel little doubt as to how to interpret the policy&rsquo;s intent and di-
rection. Policies that are subject to different interpretations will, over a period of
time, result in several possible outcomes. This can lead to inconsistent behavior, as
people will simply ignore the policy because it is so difficult to interpret.

<p>Supplier Relationship
Policies Apply to Everyone
at Wal-Mart!
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Chief Executive H. Lee Scott, who recently was accused by a fired
marketing executive of accepting sweetheart deals from suppliers, purchased a diamond ring
from a Wal-Mart vendor, according to that vendor&rsquo;s officials.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scott purchased the ring for his wife in April 2003 from The Aaron Group, a wholesale sup-
plier of jewelry to Wal-Mart, said Robert Kempler, president of the New York&ndash;based company.
Mr. Kempler declined to discuss the terms of the diamond sale other than to say Mr. Scott
hadn&rsquo;t received preferential pricing.
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart has a famously strict ethics code that prohibits employees from receiving anything
free from suppliers. It has pursued even senior executives who violate these policies. Last
week, Julie Roehm, a former Wal-Mart marketing executive who was fired in December for al-
legedly violating the retailer&rsquo;s ethics rules, claimed in a federal court filing that Mr. Scott ob-
tained &ldquo;a number of yachts&rdquo; and &ldquo;a large pink diamond&rdquo; at preferential prices.
</p>
<p>The lawsuit didn&rsquo;t identify the specifics of the diamond sale, other than to say that Mr. Scott
had purchased the stone through a relationship with Irwin Jacobs, a financier who has numer-
ous business relationships with Wal-Mart. It isn&rsquo;t clear whether the diamond ring purchased
from The Aaron Group is the same one referred to in Ms. Roehm&rsquo;s suit.
</p>
<p>Mr. Kempler said he&rsquo;d never heard of Mr. Jacobs, and he said everything about the transac-
tion was &ldquo;above board.&rdquo; Mr. Jacobs said the allegations were without any substance and de-
nied knowing anything about any diamond purchase by the Wal-Mart CEO.
</p>
<p>A Wal-Mart spokeswoman declined to comment specifically on the diamond purchase or Wal-
Mart&rsquo;s policies on employee purchases from suppliers. Mr. Scott &ldquo;is subject to the same eth-
ics policy as any other associate and has not violated either the spirit or the letter of Wal-
Mart&rsquo;s ethical standards,&rdquo; the spokeswoman said. She characterized the allegations in Ms.
Roehm&rsquo;s court filing as &ldquo;old news. No facts have been presented to back them up.&rdquo;

<p>Another characteristic of effective policies is that they are timely and current,
which assumes that they are periodically reviewed for clarity and conformance. A pol-
icy is ineffective or counterproductive if it is confusing, ignored, or outdated. For ex-
ample, in the opening vignette, each cement plant was operating under a different set
of rules, and everyone was essentially ignoring the fact that a common set of policies
or procedures existed! Policy formation and review should be a dynamic activity un-
dertaken at least once every year or so. A policy may be timely and correct but not
properly enforced by management. In this case, it is management&rsquo;s responsibility to
re-educate the workforce about the policy&rsquo;s intent. There is no other substitute for de-
tailed training on policies, to ensure that everyone understands how to do their jobs.
</p>
<p>The following characteristics apply to effective policies:
</p>
<p>&bull; Action oriented
&bull; Relevant
&bull; Concise
&bull; Unambiguous/well understood
&bull; Timely and current
&bull; Guide problem solving and behavior
</p>
<p>Purchasing Policies&mdash;Providing Guidance
and Direction
</p>
<p>Purchasing management develops policies to provide guidance and support to the
professional purchasing and support staff. These policies are general outlines clarify-
ing purchasing management&rsquo;s position on a subject. Although many purchasing poli-
cies exist, most fall into one of five categories:
</p>
<p>&bull; Policies defining the role of purchasing
&bull; Policies defining the conduct of purchasing personnel
&bull; Policies defining social and minority business objectives
&bull; Policies defining buyer-seller relationships
&bull; Policies defining operational issues
</p>
<p>The following discussion does not include all possible purchasing policies. Organi-
zations will also develop policies to meet unique operational requirements.
</p>
<p>Policies Defining the Role of Purchasing
This set of policies defines purchasing&rsquo;s authority. It usually addresses the objec-
</p>
<p>tives of the purchasing function and defines the responsibilities of the various buying
levels. These policies often serve as a general or broad policy statement from which
more detailed or specific policies evolve.
</p>
<p>Origin and Scope of Purchasing Authority
Personnel at all levels must be aware of purchasing&rsquo;s authority to conduct busi-
</p>
<p>ness and to represent organizational interests. An executive committee usually grants
this authority and develops this policy. This policy may also detail the authority of

<p>Chapter 3 Purchasing Policy and Procedures 89</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>purchasing to delegate certain tasks or assignments to other departments or
functions.
</p>
<p>An important section of this policy describes the areas where purchasing authority
does or does not exist. The policy may exclude the purchasing function from any re-
sponsibility for purchasing real estate, medical insurance policies, or other areas
where purchasing may not have direct expertise. (However, purchasing is increas-
ingly becoming involved in all types of purchases, including these nontraditional
areas.) This policy outlines the overall authority of purchasing as granted by the execu-
tive committee while describing the limits to that authority.
</p>
<p>Objectives of the Purchasing Function
As noted in Chapter 2, purchasing generally has the final authority over a certain
</p>
<p>spending area. This is typically set forth in a policy describing the general objectives
or principles guiding the purchasing process. The following describes one company&rsquo;s
purchasing objectives or principles:
</p>
<p>&bull; To select suppliers that meet purchase and performance requirements
&bull; To purchase materials and services that comply with engineering and qual-
ity standards
</p>
<p>&bull; To promote buyer-seller relations and to encourage supplier contribution
&bull; To treat all suppliers fairly and ethically
&bull; To work closely with other departments
&bull; To conduct purchasing operations so they enhance community and em-
ployee relations
</p>
<p>&bull; To support all corporate objectives and policies
&bull; To maintain a qualified purchasing staff and to develop the professional capa-
bilities of that staff
</p>
<p>Although these objectives or principles appear broad, they are important because
they set forth, in writing, management&rsquo;s commitment to achieving a professional
level of purchasing behavior. These principles are also important because they give
rise to other policies that directly support purchasing activities.
</p>
<p>Corporate Purchasing Office Responsibilities
It is also useful to understand the duties and responsibilities of the central or corpo-
</p>
<p>rate purchasing office (if a central office exists). This policy may also detail the rela-
tionship of the corporate office to purchasing centers located at the divisional,
business unit, or plant level. The corporate purchasing office is usually a staff posi-
tion directing, supporting, and coordinating the purchasing effort. This policy can pro-
vide guidance concerning the role of the corporate purchasing staff in the following
areas:
</p>
<p>&bull; Carry out executive policies
&bull; Develop and publish functional purchasing and material policies and proce-
dures to support efficient and effective purchasing operations at all levels
</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate strategy development between purchasing departments or cen-
ters to maximize purchasing leverage of critical commodities
</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluate the effectiveness of purchasing operations

practices are technically not illegal but are potentially unethical or questionable.

<p>Plant Buyers
</p>
<p>Date: 1-1-04
</p>
<p>Subject: Corporate Purchasing Office Responsibilities
</p>
<p>This policy outlines the responsibilities and authority of the Corporate Purchasing office and staff
and its relationship to Division Purchasing and Buying Units.
</p>
<p>Executive policy E-7 sets forth the principles supporting the organization and management of ABC
Technologies and its operating Divisions:
</p>
<p>ABC Technologies, by executive policy, is organized on a line and staff basis, with divisional opera-
tions largely decentralized. It is corporate policy to assign responsibility and delegate authority con-
cerning operational matters to executive divisional management. All responsibilities not delegated to
divisional management remain as official responsibilities of the corporate staff.
</p>
<p>The Corporate Purchasing staff is one of the corporate staffs referred to in executive policy E-7. As
such, it retains responsibility for the following functions, activities, and duties:
</p>
<p>&bull; Responsibility for carrying out and ensuring that each division and buying unit adheres to each
corporate policy as stated by executive management.
</p>
<p>&bull; Responsibility for developing and publishing functional purchasing and material policies and
procedures. The purpose of this is to support efficient and effective purchasing operations
throughout the company.
</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate strategy development between divisional purchasing and other buying units to sup-
port companywide efficiencies and reduced duplication of effort.
</p>
<p>&bull; Develop systems to evaluate companywide purchasing performance and operations.
&bull; Provide expert support to purchasing departments and buying units throughout the company.
&bull; Assume responsibility for (1) tasks typically associated with a corporate support staff and (2)
</p>
<p>tasks not directly assigned to divisional or plant purchasing.
</p>
<p>This policy reaffirms the autonomy of the divisions and other buying centers to conduct operational
purchasing duties and functions. It also reaffirms the company&rsquo;s commitment to efficient company-
wide purchasing operations through a strong corporate support staff.

icy and the law.
</p>
<p>Ethics Policy
Most organizations, particularly medium- and larger-sized ones, have a written pol-
</p>
<p>icy describing management&rsquo;s commitment to ethical purchasing behavior. Chapter 15
discusses purchasing ethics in considerable detail.
</p>
<p>Reciprocity Policy
A formal policy often exists detailing management&rsquo;s opposition to reciprocal pur-
</p>
<p>chase agreements. Reciprocity, discussed in the purchasing ethics section of Chapter
15, occurs when suppliers are pressured to purchase the buyer&rsquo;s products or services
as a condition of securing a purchase contract. A reciprocity policy usually describes
management&rsquo;s opposition to the practice and lists the type of behavior to avoid. Per-
sonnel must not engage in behavior that suggests any of the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; A buyer gives preference to suppliers that purchase from the buyer&rsquo;s
organization.
</p>
<p>&bull; A buyer expects suppliers to purchase the buying company&rsquo;s products as a
condition for securing a purchase contract.
</p>
<p>&bull; A buyer looks favorably on competitive bids from suppliers that purchase
the buyer&rsquo;s products.
</p>
<p>This area requires an executive management policy because disagreement occurs
regarding this topic. Reciprocity is relatively easy to control once management issues
a policy on the subject.
</p>
<p>Contacts and Visits to Suppliers
An understanding must exist regarding direct visits or other communication con-
</p>
<p>tacts with suppliers or potential suppliers. This policy should address not only pur-
chasing personnel but also other departments or functions that visit or contact
suppliers. Purchasing wants to control unauthorized or excessive contacts or visits be-
cause these can impose an unnecessary burden on suppliers.
</p>
<p>Also, unauthorized supplier visits or contacts by non-purchasing personnel under-
mine purchasing&rsquo;s legitimate authority as the principal commercial contact with sup-
pliers. Purchasing wants to avoid situations where suppliers might interpret statements
and opinions offered by non-purchasing personnel as commitments.
</p>
<p>Former Employees Representing Suppliers
Occasionally, an employee may leave to work for a supplier. This is a concern be-
</p>
<p>cause the former employee probably has knowledge about business plans or other con-
fidential information that might provide an unfair advantage over other suppliers.
One way to address this issue is to establish a policy prohibiting business transac-
tions with suppliers that employ former employees known to have inside or confiden-
tial information. This exclusion can range from a period of a few months to several
years, depending on the employee and the situation. Another possibility involves in-
cluding a clause in the employee&rsquo;s original employment contract prohibiting employ-
ment with a competitor or a supplier for a specified time. This can offset the
advantage a former employee may have from his or her previous employment.

<p>Gap Cracks Down on
Suppliers with Labor Abuses
</p>
<p>Gap&rsquo;s Factory Inspections Continue to Uncover Abuses, Such As Excessive Overtime
</p>
<p>Gap Inc.&rsquo;s continuing crackdown on labor abuses at the overseas factories making the re-
tailer&rsquo;s clothes identified hundreds of plants engaged in a wide range of unsavory practices,
including excessive overtime, paltry wages, and fining workers who wanted to quit their jobs.
</p>
<p>The San Francisco&ndash;based company listed the transgressions Wednesday in a report summariz-
ing the findings of 92 inspectors, who scrutinized all but a handful of the 2,672 supplier fac-
tories approved to manufacture clothes for Gap last year.
</p>
<p>Spurred by the most terrible violations cited, Gap severed ties with 70 factories last year,
down from 136 in 2003. The company rejected 15% of the new factories seeking to make its
clothes in 2004 compared with 16% in 2003.
</p>
<p>But the owner of Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic stores continued to contract with hun-
dreds of overseas factories that mistreated its workers, according to the company&rsquo;s second
annual social responsibility report&mdash;a document that represents an unusual bit of self-flagel-
lation in corporate America.
</p>
<p>The abuses are most prevalent in China, where Gap products are made at 423 factories. Be-
tween 25 and 50% of those Chinese companies don&rsquo;t fully comply with local labor laws, Gap
said, and 10 to 25% of them pay below the minimum wage. The company ended its busi-
ness relationship with 18 Chinese factories last year&mdash;less than 5% of its suppliers in that
country.
</p>
<p>The Persian Gulf, where Gap contracts with 29 factories, caused another major headache.
More than half the factories inspected there imposed work weeks of more than 60 hours per
week. In three cases in Egypt, Morocco, and Vietnam, Gap flagged factories that required
their workers to pay them if they resigned before a contract ended. Gap required all three fac-
tories to stop the practice.
</p>
<p>By publicly acknowledging its role in the recurring labor problems at factories often derided
as &ldquo;sweatshops,&rdquo; Gap hopes to prod its entire industry to embrace reforms and establish
more rigorous standards to improve the working conditions.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;To quote U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, we believe that a &lsquo;bright light is the
best disinfectant,&rsquo; &rdquo; Gap wrote in the 58-page report. &ldquo;The more open and honest we can be
about conditions and challenges, the more helpful we can be in addressing them.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Since Gap first owned up to the troubles at its overseas factories last year, shoe manufac-
turer Nike Inc. also has launched a similar social responsibility report examining the conduct
in its overseas factories. The increased attention will likely make it appear as if things are
getting worse before they get better, Gap warned, simply because its inspectors are likely to
become progressively better at rooting out violations as time goes on.
</p>
<p>Gap acknowledged it has contributed to some of the labor problems by making last-minute
production demands that prod overseas contractors into exploiting their workers. The com-
pany has vowed to phase out its &ldquo;inefficient purchasing practices.&rdquo; Bob Jeffcott, policy ana-
lyst for the Maquila Solidarity Network, a workers&rsquo; rights group in Toronto, said he believes
Gap and other retailers that rely on overseas factories could make a huge difference by agree-
ing to pay more for their products&mdash;a daunting commitment to make because it could
erode profits or result in price increases that alienate customers. &ldquo;No one is dealing with the S

<p>Reporting of Irregular Business Dealings with Suppliers
This policy may establish a reporting mechanism for buyers or other employees to
</p>
<p>report irregular business dealings. Examples of irregular dealings include accepting
bribes from suppliers, cronyism, accepting late bids, owning a stake in a supplier&rsquo;s
company, and other types of behavior that are not considered part of the normal
course of business. The policy can specify the proper office to which to report the
irregularity, the safeguards in place to protect the reporting party, and the need to
report suspected irregularities as soon as possible. This policy sends the message that
management will not tolerate irregular business transactions involving employees.
</p>
<p>Policies Defining Social and Minority
Business Objectives
</p>
<p>In the long run it is likely in a purchaser&rsquo;s best interest to use its power to sup-
port social and minority business objectives. This may include supporting and devel-
oping local sources of supply or awarding business to qualified minority suppliers.
</p>
<p>Purchasing&rsquo;s actions help shape a perception of good corporate citizenship. Pursu-
ing social objectives may require the development of policies specifically defining man-
agement&rsquo;s position. A list of the top companies engaged in minority supplier
development is shown in Sourcing Snapshot: The Best Companies for Minority Sup-
plier Contracting.
</p>
<p>Supporting Minority Business Suppliers
Supporting minority suppliers is not only the right thing to do, it is also the smart
</p>
<p>thing to do. As the nature of America&rsquo;s demographics and workforce continually
changes, organizations will need to hire and train people with multicultural back-
grounds and promote relationships with suppliers and customers from diverse back-
grounds. At the same time, it is important to recognize that minority suppliers are a
special class of supplier. As such, they face many problems that are unique to their
special status, while also facing many of the same problems that confront nonminor-
ity suppliers. Several factors lie at the core of these problems: lack of access to capi-
tal; large firms&rsquo; efforts to optimize their supply bases; inability to attract qualified
managers and other professionals; and minority suppliers&rsquo; relatively small size, which
may lead to over-reliance on large customer firms.
</p>
<p>Management&rsquo;s position concerning transactions with minority business suppliers
provides guidance to buyers. A minority business supplier is a business that is run or
partially owned by an individual classified as a minority by the U.S. government.
Such policies typically state that these suppliers should receive a fair and equal oppor-
tunity to participate in the purchasing process. The policy may outline a number of
steps to achieve the policy&rsquo;s objectives, including the following:
</p>
<p>fundamental question on how much you should be paying these suppliers so they can afford
to pay their workers better wages,&rdquo; Jeffcott said.

<p>The Best Companies
for Minority Supplier
Contracting
</p>
<p>Many companies often deploy supplier diversity programs that are aimed at increasing
the representation of minority-owned suppliers in their supply base. For some companies, sup-
plier diversity programs are based on social considerations. However, an increasing number
of companies have focused on supplier diversity simply because it is good business. Minori-
ties now represent the largest sales growth markets, especially in consumer goods, and com-
panies realize that increasing the amount of business with minority businesses may mean
increased sales for their own firm over the long term.
</p>
<p>A list of &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Top Organizations for Multicultural Business Opportunities&rdquo; was devel-
oped as a result of a poll sponsored by DIV2000.com, an organization that provides business
connections and resources for small businesses and large organizational buyers. Over
525,000 women- and minority-owned businesses had the opportunity to vote in the online
election. The election was conducted in a secure Internet environment utilizing the latest tech-
nology available. Fortune 500 companies and government agencies were selected for the
awards based on business opportunities they provide to minority-owned businesses. The best
companies for 2005 are shown in the following table.

</p>
<p>Policies supporting disadvantaged suppliers are common in contracts with the
U.S. government, which encourages awarding subcontracts to small and disadvan-
taged suppliers. Other companies have formal procedures for including minority busi-
ness suppliers. For instance, one large pharmaceutical company has developed a
process for identifying minority suppliers, which includes the following questions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the supplier fully qualified?
&bull; Does the supplier satisfy U.S. government criteria defining a minority
business?
</p>
<p>&bull; Does the supplier meet our standard performance requirements?
&bull; Is the supplier price competitive?
&bull; How much business can we give the supplier given its capacity?
</p>
<p>Links and information having to do with minority business development can be
found at http://www.mbda.gov.
</p>
<p>A recent study on best practices conducted by the Supply Chain Resource Coopera-
tive at NC State University emphasized that companies in many industries are mak-
ing great improvements in minority supplier development programs. However, until
organizations can devote more resources to actively improving minority suppliers
through focused supplier development programs, growth of minority suppliers in the
supply base will remain problematic.
</p>
<p>The research also suggested that almost all industries have limited resources for
supplier diversity programs. One interesting observation regarding resource alloca-
tion is that industries that are rife with financial difficulties do not have the luxury to
dedicate additional resources for these programs. However, in industries that are not
experiencing financial difficulties, the research found that there was often a lack of ex-
ecutive sponsorship, which led to the same outcome: Diversity does not get enough at-
tention or budget allocation for its progress. Two important features of any supplier
development initiative were identified: process improvement and leadership/corpo-
rate commitment. These elements were viewed by many executives as critical
foundational elements for any minority supplier development initiative. The industry-
specific best practices in how organizations developed their policies and procedures
include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Mandate Tier 1 suppliers to have a Tier 2 diversity spend goal and incorpo-
rate the terms in the contracts. Tier 1 suppliers should be able to record
their diversity spend online through the customer&rsquo;s website. Increasing Tier 2
diversity spend offsets to some extent the effect of diminishing opportu-
nities for minority suppliers due to increased global sourcing and offshoreS

creases visibility and compliance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Include minority suppliers in all RFQs, without exception. Policies may be
defined on the basis of mutually agreed-upon terms between business units
and the organization&rsquo;s Supplier Diversity Council. Awarding of RFQs should
in all circumstances be tied to performance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Tie the goals and objectives of the supplier diversity program (SDP) to sup-
ply chain management strategies and supply chain job functions. Business
units should also have diversity goals tied to performance to increase partici-
pation and commitment to the program.
</p>
<p>&bull; Incorporate supplier diversity programs within the corporate procurement
organization and assign supplier diversity advocates to specific business
units. These advocates can provide training and support to buyers and drive
compliance. This approach also enables consolidation of spend with the mi-
nority suppliers that are being developed by the corporate supplier diversity
programs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Incorporate all corporate functions in which suppliers are selected and pro-
curement commitments are made. Corporate supplier diversity committees
should include management representatives from all such cross-functional
areas: Advertising, Public Relations, Finance, Legal, R&amp;D, Human Re-
sources, Engineering, Real Estate, Traffic and Distribution, Sales, and Corpo-
rate Office Administration. This is in recognition of the fact that SDP
should be a supply chain accountability and not just a corporate
accountability.
</p>
<p>Environmental Issues
A set of policies outlining a position related to environmental issues is becoming
</p>
<p>increasingly important. Moreover, governments are now requiring such policies by
law. These policies include the use of recycled material; strict compliance with local,
state, and federal regulations; and proper disposal of waste material. The Clean Air
Act of 1990 imposes large fines on producers of ozone-depleting substances and foul-
smelling gases. As a result, buyers must consider a supplier&rsquo;s ability to comply with en-
vironmental regulations as a condition for selection. This includes, but is not limited
to, the proper disposal of hazardous waste.
</p>
<p>A good example of environmental policy involves the chemical industry, which tra-
ditionally has been a major source of industrial pollution. This industry knows that if
it does not adopt a set of environmental policies, then government regulators will initi-
ate strict regulations. Dow Chemical, for example, considers environmental concerns
a critical feature of its policies and procedures.2 As a member of the Chemical Manu-
facturers Association, Dow is a participant in Responsible Care, a program initiative
that addresses a community&rsquo;s concerns regarding chemicals, including their manufac-
ture, transportation, use, and safe disposal; health and safety issues; prompt reporting
of environmental accidents; and counseling of customers. Supplier evaluation in-
volves assessing the environmental policies of suppliers (primarily other major chemi-
cal companies). A key element of evaluation involves understanding and assessing
the environmental risk associated with the particular chemical being purchased. Dow
searches for suppliers that are green, according to industry standards.

<p>Policies Defining Buyer-Seller Relationships
The policies that are part of buyer-seller relationships cover a wide range of
</p>
<p>topics. Each topic, however, relates to some issue involving the supply base.
</p>
<p>Supplier Relations
The principles that guide relations with suppliers are often contained in a policy
</p>
<p>stating that buyer-seller relationships are essential for economic success. Furthermore,
relationships based on mutual trust and respect must underlie the purchasing effort.
This policy often describes a number of principles that support positive relationships,
including the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Treating suppliers fairly and with integrity
&bull; Supporting and developing those suppliers that work to improve quality, de-
livery, cost, or other performance criteria
</p>
<p>&bull; Providing prompt payment to suppliers
&bull; Encouraging suppliers to submit innovative ideas with joint sharing of benefits
&bull; Developing open communication channels
&bull; Informing suppliers as to why they did not receive a purchase contract
&bull; Establishing a fair process to award purchase contracts
</p>
<p>Qualification and Supplier Selection
Buyers may require guidance regarding the performance criteria used to evaluate
</p>
<p>potential sources of supply or to evaluate an existing supplier for an item not tradi-
tionally provided by suppliers. Management wants to make sure that supplier selec-
tion occurs only after purchasing thoroughly reviews all criteria. Supplier selection
criteria include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Price/cost competitiveness
&bull; Product quality
&bull; Delivery performance
&bull; Financial condition
&bull; Engineering and manufacturing technical competence
&bull; Management of its own suppliers
&bull; Management capability
&bull; Ability to work with the customer
&bull; Potential for innovation
</p>
<p>This policy may also outline management&rsquo;s position on single and multiple sourc-
ing or the use of longer-term purchase agreements. It may also acknowledge purchas-
ing&rsquo;s need to rely on non-purchasing personnel to evaluate technical or financial
criteria during the supplier selection process.
</p>
<p>Principles and Guidelines for Awarding Purchase Contracts
The process for selecting and awarding purchase contracts is central to effective
</p>
<p>purchasing. This policy covers a number of critical topics:
</p>
<p>&bull; Buyer&rsquo;s authority to award a contract within a certain dollar limit
&bull; Conditions where the competitive bid process is and is not acceptable

<p>&bull; Conditions outlining the use of competitive bids
&bull; Process of analyzing sealed competitive bids
&bull; Conditions prompting the sourcing of an item to other than the lowest bid
supplier
</p>
<p>&bull; Conditions prompting a rebid
&bull; Operating guidelines that pertain to the negotiation of contracts with
suppliers
</p>
<p>Although there is a trend toward less reliance on competitive bids and more on ne-
gotiated longer-term agreements, many contracts are still awarded through the com-
petitive bid process. Routine items available from many different sources are
generally purchased through competitive bidding. It is important for purchasing to
have a standard set of guidelines for awarding purchase contracts to suppliers. These
guidelines provide assurances that purchasing awards contracts based on a fair set of
principles.
</p>
<p>Labor or Other Difficulties at Suppliers
Management&rsquo;s position concerning supply or labor disruptions as well as possible
</p>
<p>courses of action provides guidelines during supplier strikes or other labor problems.
One issue this policy can address is the legal removal of company-owned tooling
from suppliers during a strike so that the buyer can establish an additional source dur-
ing the interruption. The policy can provide details about this issue, which can be
part of the contract with the supplier, to suspend temporarily any purchase contracts
or outstanding orders with a striking supplier. Since 9/11, emergency policies must
be established to deal with sudden disruptions in the supply chain. In one case, a sin-
gle-source supplier to Toyota had a supplying plant burn down; there was no official
policy to deal with this issue. Other major automotive companies including Honda
and Nissan ended up working with Toyota to help it obtain parts during this crisis.
</p>
<p>Other Policies Dealing with Buyer-Seller Relations
Organizations must be cautious about liabilities associated with accepting and
</p>
<p>using ideas provided by suppliers interested in doing business with a purchaser. A pol-
icy may state that the buyer accepts unsolicited proposals from interested suppliers
only on a nonconfidential basis with no obligation or liability to the provider. Suppli-
ers may even have to sign a waiver releasing the purchaser from liabilities in this
area.
</p>
<p>Another policy can clarify management&rsquo;s position on financial obligations to sup-
pliers that provide early product design involvement. A buyer may request that suppli-
ers submit cost-reduction ideas during the early phases of new-product design. This
policy can provide guidance about the extent of financial obligation to suppliers, par-
ticularly to suppliers whose ideas were not accepted.
</p>
<p>In cases where purchasing is attempting to integrate suppliers into the new-prod-
uct development process, many companies have established a policy manual written
by engineering, marketing, manufacturing, and purchasing. This manual specifies the
steps in developing a new product and the triggers in the process that identify when
and how suppliers should be part of the process. The policy may also specify the
types of nondisclosure agreements used, the criteria for sharing patents, and other
joint product development policies.

<p>Policies Defining Operational Issues
The broadest of the five purchasing policy categories involves policies that provide
</p>
<p>guidance for operational issues that confront buyers during the normal performance
of duties.
</p>
<p>Hazardous Materials
Purchasers must take an active role controlling hazardous waste. During the last
</p>
<p>10 years, new regulations and policies outlined the proper handling of toxic and haz-
ardous material. In the period from 1899 to 1950, the U.S. government passed seven
laws that involved environmental protection. From 1976 to 1978, Congress passed
nine environmental laws. More recent legislation has further emphasized the need for
business to have a carefully considered response to environmental initiatives. An-
other important trend is the requirement for an organization to be ISO 14000 certi-
fied to engage in global business transactions. ISO 14000 certification requires
companies to establish an environmental management system (EMS) to deal with en-
vironmental issues.44 An EMS requires a company to do the following:

<p>Consider the following examples described in the Wall Street Journal:3
</p>
<p>&bull; At Lear Corp., a large Southfield, Mich.&ndash;based auto-parts supplier, 17 relatives of
senior officials are employed by or have business ties to the company, a group of
family ties that the company failed to report until late last year despite a federal
requirement to do so.
</p>
<p>&bull; Apple Computer Inc. paid Chief Executive Steven Jobs nearly $1.2 million to reim-
burse him for costs he incurred using his personal Gulfstream V jet on company
business in 2001 and 2002. Apple is one of many companies with side deals in-
volving the private planes of their executives.
</p>
<p>&bull; Ford Motor Co. paid two of its directors, William Clay Ford and Edsel B. Ford II,
hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees. The two members of the
auto giant&rsquo;s founding family also receive directors&rsquo; pay and millions of dollars of
dividends on their Ford stock.
</p>
<p>&bull; Sam Nunn has served on the board of seven public companies since he left the
Senate in 1996. All those companies have done business with his law firm, King
&amp; Spalding, while he was serving on the boards.
</p>
<p>In the wake of Enron and other corporate scandals, these types of transactions&mdash;generally de-
fined as a business deal involving an outside director, senior executive, significant shareholder,
or a relative of one of those people&mdash;are attracting new attention from government officials
and business and labor leaders. New legislation curtails certain deals. Other rules are in the
works aimed at increasing the independence and accountability of corporate officers and direc-
tors. But related-party transactions remain legal and deeply entwined in the corporate culture.
This is an increasingly important area for purchasing policy making to consider.

<p>Involvement in developing an EMS is a critical responsibility for purchasing, be-
cause the purchase of waste disposal services is often a purchasing task. For compa-
nies that routinely use or produce hazardous materials, the law requires a policy that
outlines in detail the legal requirements and conditions for the handling of toxic
waste. Failure to have such a policy is considered a federal offense. This policy details
the responsibility of purchasing to select only those contractors that conform to local,
state, and federal laws. Before awarding a contract for the hauling and disposing of
dangerous materials, some policies require that the contractor provide the following
detailed information:
</p>
<p>&bull; Evidence of valid permits and licenses
&bull; Specification of the types of disposal services the contractor is licensed to
provide
</p>
<p>&bull; Evidence of safeguards to prevent accidents along with contingency plans
and preparations if a hazardous spill occurs
</p>
<p>&bull; Details of the specific process used to control hazardous material once it
exits a buyer&rsquo;s facilities
</p>
<p>&bull; Evidence of adequate liability insurance on the part of the contractor
&bull; Evidence that the waste transporter uses properly certified disposal sites
</p>
<p>Selecting a qualified hazardous waste contractor is critical. On a larger scale, this re-
quires an environmental policy that is clearly expressed. Increased government and
public awareness of environmental concerns is driving this issue.
</p>
<p>Supplier Responsibility for Defective Material
This policy outlines supplier responsibility for defective material shipments or other
</p>
<p>types of nonperformance. It usually details the various charge-back costs for which sup-
pliers are liable in the event of nonperformance. These costs can include the cost of ma-
terial rework, repackaging for return shipment, additional material-handling costs,
return shipping costs, or costs associated with lost or delayed production. Purchasers op-
erating in a just-in-time environment are usually quite strict about the charges associ-
ated with supplier-caused material problems. A single defective shipment in a just-in-
time production environment can shut down an entire production process, resulting in
some cases in fines of up to $10,000 per minute (in automotive OEMs).
</p>
<p>Defective material policies may also outline purchasing&rsquo;s authority to negotiate
and settle claims against suppliers. This requires purchasing to carefully review each
nonperformance to determine a fair settlement. This policy provides protection for
the purchaser in the case of supplier-caused problems.
</p>
<p>Purchased Item Comparisons
Another policy may outline management&rsquo;s position concerning the continued eval-
</p>
<p>uation of purchased items. This evaluation may require buyers to periodically review
purchased items or services to determine if existing suppliers still maintain market
leadership. This evaluation can include cost, quality, delivery, and technological
comparisons.

<p>Sourcing
Snapshot
</p>
<p>Caterpillar&rsquo;s Code
of Conduct
</p>
<p>Caterpillar is almost a century old. The company, based in Peoria, IL, has grown from a
Midwest manufacturer of farm equipment into a global construction equipment powerhouse.
With this growth into different countries, cultures, and markets, the company has also strug-
gled at times to maintain the Midwest homegrown culture of integrity associated with its
early roots. To that end, Jim Owens, CEO, has put forth a code of conduct that applies to all
associates, based on the code that &ldquo;integrity is the foundation of all we do.&rdquo; An additional
set of implied statements were developed that have direct implications for purchasing policy
and actions of purchasing associates. In particular, the following elements stand out:
</p>
<p>&bull; We align our actions with our words and deliver what we promise. We build and
strengthen our reputation through trust. We do not improperly influence others or
let them improperly influence us. In short, the reputation of the enterprise reflects
the ethical performance of the people who work here.
</p>
<p>&bull; We are honest and we act with integrity. We hold ourselves to the highest stan-
dard of integrity. We strive to keep our commitments. Our company&rsquo;s share-
holders, customers, dealers, those with whom we do business (suppliers), and
our fellow employees must be able to trust what we say and to believe that we
will always keep our word.
</p>
<p>&bull; We compete fairly. Caterpillar believes that fair competition is fundamental to
free enterprise. In relationships with competitors, dealers, suppliers, and custo-
mers, we avoid arrangements or understandings with competitors affecting
prices, terms upon which products are sold, or the number and type of products
manufactured or sold.
</p>
<p>&bull; We ensure accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and accounting re-
ports. The same standards of integrity that apply to external financial reporting ap-
ply to the financial statements that we use as internal management tools.
</p>
<p>&bull; We are fair, honest, and open in our communications. We keep investors, cred-
itors, securities trading markets, employees, dealers, suppliers, and the general
public informed on a timely basis through public release of relevant and under-
standable financial and other information about our company. In releasing infor-
mation about Caterpillar, we make every effort to ensure that full disclosure is
made to everyone without preference or favoritism to any individual or group.
</p>
<p>&bull; We handle &ldquo;inside information&rdquo; appropriately and lawfully. A Caterpillar employee
who has undisclosed information about a supplier, customer, or competitor
should not trade in that company&rsquo;s stock, nor should an employee advise others
to do so.
</p>
<p>&bull; We refuse to make improper payments. In dealing with public officials, other cor-
porations, suppliers, and private citizens, we firmly adhere to ethical business
practices.
</p>
<p>&bull; We will not seek to influence others, either directly or indirectly, by paying bribes
or kickbacks, or by any other measure that is unethical or that will tarnish our rep-
utation for honesty and integrity. Even the appearance of such conduct must be
avoided.

<p>102 Part 2 Purchasing Operations and Structure</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://www.cat.com">http://www.cat.com</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For items purchased through the competitive bid process, purchased item compar-
isons often mean requesting new bids for an item from qualified suppliers. This pol-
icy usually states how often management expects competitive comparisons and the
general procedure for conducting a comparison. For items on longer-term purchase
contracts, purchased item comparisons may involve benchmarking or comparing cost
performance against leading competitors.
</p>
<p>Other Operating Policies
Many other operating policies guide purchasing. Additional examples include poli-
</p>
<p>cies that outline the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Compliance with U.S. laws and regulations
&bull; Restrictions on source selection outside of the purchasing function
&bull; The proper disposal of material assets
&bull; Purchasing&rsquo;s legal right to terminate a purchase contract or order
&bull; Supplier responsibility for premium transportation costs
&bull; Supplier-requested changes in contractual terms and conditions
&bull; Supplier use of trademarks or logos
</p>
<p>All of the policies just listed have something in common: They clarify manage-
ment&rsquo;s position on a topic while providing guidance to the personnel responsible for
carrying out the policy. The outcome of these policies should be consistent actions
on the part of personnel at different locations or organizational levels. A basic set of
policy statements outlining management&rsquo;s position on different topic areas should be
readily available and distributed. All policies should be regularly reviewed and up-
dated. Increasingly, progressive companies are posting their policies on their intranet.
</p>
<p>Purchasing Procedures
Procedures are the operating instructions detailing functional duties or tasks, and a
</p>
<p>procedure manual is really a how-to manual. A large purchasing department may
have hundreds of procedures detailing the accepted practice for carrying out an
activity.
</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this discussion to present more than a brief overview of
purchasing procedures, particularly because there is no uniform set of principles to
guide the development of purchasing procedures. Every organization develops a
unique set of operating instructions to meet its own specific requirements.
</p>
<p>A procedure manual serves a number of important purposes. First, the manual is
a reference guide for purchasing personnel and is especially valuable to new employ-
ees who require explanation about how to accomplish different activities or assign-
ments. For experienced personnel, the manual provides clarification or simply
reinforces knowledge about different topics. Second, the manual provides consistency
and order by documenting the steps and activities required to perform a task. A
well-documented procedure manual supports efficient operations and is usually more
extensive and detailed than the policy manual. The procedure manual may also spec-
ify industry best practices to follow that are identified through benchmarking compar-
isons with leading firms.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Simplifying procedures should be a goal whenever possible. A primary emphasis
should be on the development of a concise, accurate, and complete set of operating in-
structions. A word of caution is in order here. A procedure is ineffective if it specifies
too many steps to carry out or presents unnecessary detail. Many companies have
</p>
<p>Exhibit 3.2 Examples of a Functional Purchasing Procedure
</p>
<p>ABC Technologies
Purchasing Procedure
</p>
<p>Procedure Number: 4.3 Date: 10/1/00
</p>
<p>Subject: Sourcing Requests from Engineering
</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>This procedure outlines the steps to follow when purchasing receives a material request from engi-
neering with a Specified Source form attached (form SS-1). Processing a specified source request dif-
fers from processing a suggested supplier source listing. The purpose of this procedure is to
evaluate engineering source requests in a fair, timely, and thorough manner.
</p>
<p>II. RELATED POLICY
</p>
<p>Executive policy grants purchasing the authority to obtain materials, components, and other items
that meet the delivery, quality, lowest total cost, and other competitive requirements of the com-
pany. Restriction of this authority can have a serious impact on purchasing&rsquo;s ability to perform its re-
quired duties and assignments. Certain conditions, however, may warrant the specification of
sources by departments other than purchasing.
</p>
<p>III. RESPONSIBILITY
</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the direct supervisor or manager of the buyer that receives the Specified
Source form to evaluate and determine the final disposition of the specified source request in accor-
dance with the following procedure.
</p>
<p>IV. PROCEDURE
</p>
<p>A. Upon receipt of an SS-1 form submitted by engineering, purchasing departmental management
verifies that each section of the form is properly completed.
</p>
<p>B. Purchasing management must verify that the requested item is not currently an actively pur-
chased item. If the item is currently purchased, purchasing must inform engineering of this.
</p>
<p>C. For items not currently purchased, purchasing management must evaluate engineering&rsquo;s reasons
for specifying a source for the required item. It is also within purchasing&rsquo;s authority to identify
and evaluate equally qualified sources if the reasons for the specified source are found not to re-
flect acceptable purchasing or market principles.
</p>
<p>D. If engineering&rsquo;s source request is accepted, purchasing management signs the Specified Source
form and promptly processes the purchase order.
</p>
<p>E. Rejected requests are sent back to engineering with reasons. In order to promote close working re-
lations between purchasing and engineering, purchasing will respond to specified source requests
within a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, purchasing agrees to work with engineering to
identify sources that satisfy engineering&rsquo;s technical requirements while meeting the commercial re-
quirements of the company.

<p/>

<p>found that the traditional procedure for developing new products does not support co-
operation between departments. Existing procedures are being replaced by stream-
lined procedures that encourage timeliness and responsiveness. As with a policy,
management must review and evaluate its procedures to make sure that they are
timely and accurate and that they contribute to rather than hinder performance.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 3.2 shows a purchasing procedure for a large high-technology company.
This procedure, which establishes purchasing&rsquo;s authority to select sources of supply,
includes the different sections just discussed. As with all procedures, this procedure
will require future review to verify its timeliness and effectiveness. Increasingly, engi-
neering and purchasing are located closer together to reduce product development cy-
cle times. When this occurs, the determination of source selection often is made by a
team rather than an individual. Existing procedures may no longer apply when well-
established processes are changed.
</p>
<p>Purchasing Procedural Areas
There are procedures to cover just about any subject involving purchasing. Most
</p>
<p>purchasing procedures correspond to one of the following areas.
</p>
<p>The Purchasing Cycle
Existing procedures usually document the proper steps to follow during each stage
</p>
<p>of the purchasing cycle or process. The purchasing process is described in Chapter 2.
</p>
<p>The Proper Use of Purchasing Forms
A typical purchasing function relies on many forms to conduct its business. Recall
</p>
<p>that Chapter 2 provided examples of commonly used purchasing documents and
forms. The procedure manual is a valuable source that includes a description of the
proper use of each form, the detailed meaning of each information field on the form,
and a description of the proper handling and storage of each form. For the latter
point, this usually includes information about where, and for how long, to store each
copy of the form along with required signatures or approvals. Storage can be manual
or electronic. The movement toward electronic storage of forms requires major revi-
sions to procedures relating to this subject.
</p>
<p>The Development of Legal Contracts
The development of legal purchase contracts can require dozens of pages and ad-
</p>
<p>dress many topics. Most organizations have specific procedures for contracting with out-
side suppliers and individuals for goods and services. It is the purchasing employee&rsquo;s
responsibility to become familiar with and follow the procedures covering legal con-
tracts. Some of the topics discussed in legal contract procedures include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Basic features of the standard purchase contract
&bull; Basic contract principles
&bull; Execution and administration of agreements
&bull; Essential elements of the contract
&bull; Compliance with contract terms and performance assessment
&bull; Formal competitive contracting procedures
&bull; Contract development process

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Examples of sample agreements
&bull; Legal definitions
&bull; Use of formal contract clauses
</p>
<p>The procedures covering the development, execution, and enforcement of legal pur-
chase agreements and contracts are usually quite detailed (much like the contracts
themselves!). A purchaser may rely on a specialized staff to provide assistance in this
complex procedural area.
</p>
<p>Operational Procedures
Operational procedures provide instruction and detail across a broad range of
</p>
<p>topics. A procedure can be developed for any operational topic that benefits from fol-
lowing a specific set of steps, requires consistent action to promote efficiency and
consistency, or carries out the directives of functional or executive policies. The follow-
ing procedure topics appear in the material manual of a Fortune 500 company:
</p>
<p>&bull; Control of material furnished to suppliers
&bull; Storage of purchasing documents
&bull; Process of supplier qualification
&bull; Use of purchasing computerized systems
&bull; Analysis of competitive quotations
&bull; Use of single source selection
&bull; Requirements for order pricing and analysis
&bull; Procedures for cost analysis
&bull; Acceptable cost reduction techniques and documentation
&bull; Intracompany transactions
&bull; Processing and handling of overshipments
&bull; Supplier acknowledgment of purchase orders
&bull; Disposition of nonconforming purchased material
&bull; Removal of company-owned tooling from supplier
</p>
<p>This is a small sample of the different operational topics that often require docu-
mented procedures. The topic of purchasing procedures is broad and sometimes mun-
dane. However, an effective set of procedures can result in the efficient use of a
purchasing professional&rsquo;s time. Procedures serve as a ready reference covering a host
of questions. They also ensure that employees follow the same basic steps when per-
forming similar tasks.

<p>Best Practices in Diverse
Supplier Development

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Leadership support of diversity goals involves establishing specific strategic objectives and
performance goals that ensure that the initiative is taken seriously. Leaders lead by example,
and this applies to diversity goals as well. A number of best practices, identified through inter-
views with executives, are listed below. In each case, the company ensured that senior execu-
tives were motivated to include diverse suppliers in their sourcing decisions and that efforts
were used to promote the policy across business functions. Consider the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; An executive diversity council was instituted in one company to review and guide
the supplier diversity program. This council ensured that top management were in-
volved and participated in the program. One of the pharmaceutical health care
companies cited an example where the CFO took the lead as the program cham-
pion, with active sponsorship of the CEO. This sent a message to the organiza-
tion that the leadership team was serious about diversity.
</p>
<p>&bull; The CEO and other higher-ranking officers should demonstrate personal commit-
ment to the supplier diversity program through participating in SDP events, meet-
ing with the diversity council members and with minority suppliers, and
spreading success stories and personal commitment through formal communica-
tion with the organization.
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier diversity goals should be included in executive performance plans. In one
of the leading aerospace companies, implementing the plan has resulted in ac-
tive executive leadership at the top and has triggered initiatives such as out-
reach events, support of advocacy groups, and travel around the country to find
suppliers and make investments to help promote diverse suppliers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Performance reviews of managers involved in buying activities in various depart-
ments in the organization should include supplier diversity program goals. Devel-
oping the supplier diversity program should not be thought of as a responsibility
of the procurement department or the supplier diversity advocates, but should be
the responsibility of all buyers in the organization.
</p>
<p>In view of the fact that every industry is unique and has its own challenges and opportu-
nities, the best practices identified in the SCRC report may need to be synthesized as is appro-
priate on a case-by-case basis. The research points to the fact that supplier development is
the weakest link in most companies&rsquo; supplier diversity programs. Supply managers need to
dedicate more time and resources toward helping minority suppliers grow and become more
capable of serving the needs of the customers. It is also essential to form a critical mass
with competitors and suppliers to support the supplier development efforts. The new mantra
is quickly becoming &ldquo;Help your partners to serve you better.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Questions
1. Why do you believe supply management leaders are not inherently motivated to pursue mi-
nority suppliers unless such measures are taken?
</p>
<p>2. What are some specific ways that the CEO and other senior executives can demonstrate
commitment to supplier diversity objectives?
</p>
<p>3. What are the tangible benefits that differentiate the firms in Sourcing Snapshot: The Best
Companies for Minority Supplier Contracting from others? How do they benefit from being
on this list versus others that are not?

<p>CONCLUSION
Understanding policies and procedures is essential for understanding how organi-
</p>
<p>zations operate and work. Policy is based on the idea that guidelines are documented
and applicable to all the internal and external relations of an organization. A policy
prescribes methods of accomplishment in terms broad enough for decision makers to
exercise discretion while allowing employees to render judgment on an issue. Well-
formulated policies and procedures support efficient, effective, and consistent purchas-
ing operations. On the other hand, policies and procedures that are out of date,
require unnecessary actions, or do not address current issues or topics will not sup-
port effective purchasing operations. As organizations expand their global sourcing ac-
tivity, they are increasingly revisiting their purchasing policies and procedures, to
ensure that they are keeping up with the rapid set of changes their professional associ-
ates are facing in their work lives.

<p>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. Write a brief policy statement that presents a position on the need for utilizing
more diverse suppliers. What are the features or characteristics that your policy
statement should have?
</p>
<p>2. Why is it important to include a policy that outlines the origin and scope of pur-
chasing authority? What might happen if such a policy did not exist?
</p>
<p>3. Why should management periodically review its purchasing policies and proce-
dures? What are the potential consequences if management does not review poli-
cies and procedures? How often do you think it should go through a minor or
major set of rewrites?
</p>
<p>4. What are the benefits associated with a comprehensive policy and procedure man-
ual? Is there a downside to the manual&rsquo;s being too comprehensive?
</p>
<p>5. Discuss the concept of ethics. Why is the purchasing profession particularly sensi-
tive to this topic?
</p>
<p>6. Describe a potential ethical dilemma that a purchasing professional might encoun-
ter in day-to-day activities.
</p>
<p>7. Describe a potential situation in which a purchasing professional might be guilty
of conflict of interest.
</p>
<p>8. What are the risks associated with backdoor (maverick) buying and selling? Why
is purchasing interested in controlling this business practice?
</p>
<p>9. Consider the elements of the code of conduct developed by Caterpillar in Sourc-
ing Snapshot: Caterpillar&rsquo;s Code of Conduct. What are some specific examples of
purchasing behavior that would violate elements of this code of conduct?
</p>
<p>10. This chapter listed a number of different operational procedures. Describe and dis-
cuss three additional topic areas that might benefit from written procedures.

<p>The Critical Role of Purchasing at Manitowoc
</p>
<p>Once lowly bureaucrats, purchasing managers are shifting onto the front lines. Robert
Ward is one of them and is in charge of purchasing for Manitowoc Co., one of the world&rsquo;s big-
gest crane makers. His job is to ensure an unbroken flow of parts and materials from
around the globe, hunting industrial tires in China and scouring the Midwest for giant bear-
ings. And he has broad discretion over Manitowoc&rsquo;s operations to make sure critical supplies
aren&rsquo;t held up.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buyers are the ones with the checkbook&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a huge power in that,&rdquo; says
Mr. Ward. Recently, he was in France, agitated, and meeting with two Polish suppliers that
weren&rsquo;t delivering all of the metal chassis they had promised to Manitowoc&rsquo;s big crane fac-
tory in Germany. No chassis means no cranes.
</p>
<p>The president of one of the suppliers&mdash;who had just driven 16 hours from Poland to meet
with Mr. Ward and other managers&mdash;announced unexpectedly that deliveries could actually
slow further in coming months. &ldquo;I have a lot of angry customers, because I have not been
able to deliver cranes,&rdquo; said Mr. Ward, gazing at the Pole over the top of his half-glasses.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ward is one of a new breed of purchasing gurus who have become a hot commodity in
recent years. As more companies globalize and outsource production, they need a top-level
point person who can manage these complex relationships, navigate various foreign cultures,
and be willing to travel constantly.
</p>
<p>Nothing is worse for a buyer&rsquo;s reputation than throwing business to a low-ball supplier that
then has trouble delivering. Mr. Ward has had his share of problems. For example, he has
been working recently with a new supplier in China to develop it as a low-cost alternative
for a U.S.-made part used in Manitowoc&rsquo;s refrigeration equipment, called a &ldquo;copper
accumulator.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The supplier told us he was UL qualified,&rdquo; says Mr. Ward, referring to the Underwriters Labo-
ratories certification that is often required on manufactured goods. Manitowoc did its own
due diligence, conducting engineering and quality studies of samples sent by the Chinese out-
fit and visiting the supplier&rsquo;s factory in China.
</p>
<p>But on a recent trip, the supplier admitted to Mr. Ward he wasn&rsquo;t UL approved after all. &ldquo;So
now we&rsquo;re back to square one,&rdquo; he says. In another case, he thought he had found a good
low-cost Chinese supplier for the electric horns used on cranes. Horns are a very basic item
and finding a cheaper source than the company&rsquo;s current U.S. supplier seemed like it would
be a no-brainer, he says. But, he has tested two shipments of samples thus far&mdash;and the
horns keep failing Manitowoc&rsquo;s quality tests.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing you have to realize is that if you&rsquo;re going to buy so much from outside the com-
pany, you&rsquo;d better be very good at it,&rdquo; says Glen Tellock, Manitowoc&rsquo;s chief executive, noting
that in the crane business alone the percentage of the total cost of products made up of out-
sourced components has doubled to 60% in the past decade. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not good at buying
in today&rsquo;s world, it&rsquo;s a big competitive disadvantage.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Mr. Tellock says it&rsquo;s crucial to have someone like Mr. Ward, who reports to him, guiding
the system. And it helps, he adds, that he comes from outside the company&mdash;and the
industry&mdash;because he brings new ideas. That was critical because the crane business is Man-
itowoc&rsquo;s most global and also the one that has faced the biggest problems with suppliers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ward has been through this situation before and finds that power is constantly shifting
from buyers to sellers and back again. Last year it was tires. Manitowoc&rsquo;s factories kept run-
ning short of the large sizes of tires used on mobile cranes.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The opening vignette illustrates how important supply management is in determin-
ing firm performance. The area of supply delivery and availability is becoming an in-
creasingly important element in the global supply chain. A single glitch in the supply
chain, such as the earthquake described in Sourcing Snapshot: Apple&rsquo;s I-Pod Supply
Chain at Risk, can shut down multiple assembly plants and impact customer delivery
and sales around the globe. In this new environment of global sourcing, the need for
supply management to work closely with businesses to drive cost savings, reduce dis-
ruptions and risk, and deliver innovation and value to customers becomes more im-
portant than ever.
</p>
<p>But no matter how many times Mr. Ward pressed his longtime suppliers, they refused to pro-
duce more for him. So he called an outside consulting firm, which sent him a list of 97 tire
factories from Brazil to Bulgaria that could potentially make the tires. He eventually found
one in China.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, my old tire suppliers are saying they can make more for me
after all,&rdquo; says Mr. Ward. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing what a little competition can do.&rdquo;

<p>Apple&rsquo;s I-Pod Supply
Chain at Risk
</p>
<p>Could a typhoon in Manila affect what teenagers in Minneapolis find in their Christmas
stockings?
</p>
<p>A lot of high-tech gadgets are made in the Philippine Islands, including parts of Apple Com-
puter&rsquo;s iPod music player. Apple depends on that Philippine link in its supply chain: In the
third quarter of 2007 (July through September), Apple sold almost 9 million iPods, an aver-
age of just under 100,000 per day.
</p>
<p>In September, researcher Nathaniel Forbes reviewed the contingency planning at a Philip-
pines factory that assembles 1.8-inch disk drives that go into iPods. I&rsquo;ll call the factory
&ldquo;Pod Parts.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Pod Parts is located in Laguna Technopark (LTI), about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the
capital city of Manila. Pod Parts ships 20,000&thorn; disk drives each day from this factory. It em-
ploys 6,000 people and runs 24 hours a day. To give you a sense of the human logistics in-
volved, Pod Parts contracts a fleet of 80 buses to bring those employees to and from work
(most employees don&rsquo;t own cars).
</p>
<p>In the review, it was discovered that Pod Parts has only one factory making iPod disk drives&mdash;
this one in the Philippines. If it were destroyed, it would take months, and several hundred
million dollars, to build a new assembly line from scratch for 1.8-inch drives.
</p>
<p>Apple needs at least 50,000 drives a day to make iPods, and probably more, assuming that
flash memory iPods don&rsquo;t need disk drives. What would be the business impact (on Apple,
and on Pod Parts&rsquo; relationship with Apple) if Pod Parts couldn&rsquo;t deliver those drives?S

<p>112 Part 2 Purchasing Operations and Structure</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Purchasing offices were once corporate backwaters, filled with people who didn&rsquo;t
dream of advancing to the top rungs of their organizations. Many buyers saw them-
selves as industrial bureaucrats, filing purchase orders with the same short list of
</p>
<p>Sure they could&mdash;the other supplier is just down the street in Laguna Technopark&mdash;about 1
kilometer away. In fact, there are four other manufacturers in Laguna Technopark that supply
Pod Parts with components for disk drives. For manufacturing efficiency, the proximity of
these factories to one another is an obvious advantage. Their proximity is, however, a poten-
tial risk to the continuity of the supply chain. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a natural catastrophe that
would affect just one manufacturer in LTI; it&rsquo;s likely they&rsquo;d all be affected at the same time.
</p>
<p>Is a calamity likely? Pod Parts has a documented and tested emergency-response system, an
active emergency team, and a visible and active security force. There is a municipal fire de-
partment in LTI. There are fire extinguishers all over the plant. Pod Parts is reasonably pre-
pared for a fire or a plant-specific event. But what if a widespread national catastrophe
occurred? Consider the following data:
</p>
<p>1. The Taal volcano, 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Pod Parts, is one of 16 &ldquo;Decade
Volcanoes&rdquo; identified as a serious potential hazard to population centers by the
International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth&rsquo;s Interior.
(Manila is the sixth largest city in the world with a population of 10 million peo-
ple.) The Taal volcano recorded 29 volcanic earthquakes in one day in September
2006, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(PHIVOLCS). The Philippine Islands are in the Pacific Ring of Fire, which includes
75% of the world&rsquo;s active volcanoes.
</p>
<p>2. There were four earthquakes in the Philippines in one weekend in October 2006,
one felt in Laguna that measured 4.7 on the Richter scale. The Philippines experi-
ences up to 10 earthquakes a day, according to PHIVOLCS.
</p>
<p>3. Tropical storms and typhoons are a regular occurrence in the Philippines. Just two
weeks after Forbes visited, Typhoon Xangsane (means &ldquo;elephant&rdquo;) killed 80 people
in Manila, left as many missing, and blew over so many gigantic billboards that
the government is changing regulations to prohibit them.
</p>
<p>Typhoon Xangsane also went directly over Laguna. Another serious typhoon was also headed
toward the Philippines in October.
</p>
<p>The area around Laguna Technopark is subject to regular flooding from storm water, blocking
logistics in and out of the area. Pod Parts even sends people home early when a serious
storm is forecast, because of the risk that the roads will be impassable.
</p>
<p>Pod Parts has about two days of finished product stored on-site, waiting for shipment. The
drives are just too valuable to keep around in inventory. Construction of an alternative produc-
tion line is excruciatingly expensive and would raise the cost of production, putting Pod Parts
at a competitive disadvantage to its competitor.
</p>
<p>A disruption at Pod Parts could have a direct and serious impact on Apple&rsquo;s ability to pro-
duce iPods; any effects would be felt within about 48 hours of its occurrence.
</p>
<p>If that interruption happened in October, it could drastically reduce the supply of iPods avail-
able at retail for Christmas. Two years ago, in late October 2006, LTI experienced the most de-
structive typhoon in the last decade.

<p>familiar, mostly nearby suppliers. When possible, they avoided the complex process
of assessing potential new suppliers, especially those overseas.
</p>
<p>Top supply managers today need different skills and often have higher aspirations.
Sometimes they&rsquo;re engineers or others with operating experience that gives them
more intimate knowledge of how their company&rsquo;s products are made.
</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s transformation in buying was made possible by a technological break-
through more than a decade ago, when companies began installing computer systems
that record their every transaction. This often revealed startling weaknesses. For in-
stance, many companies found that different divisions&mdash;or even different offices
down the hall from one another&mdash;were sometimes paying different prices for the
same product bought from outside suppliers.
</p>
<p>Purchasing managers play a role as highly effective cost cutters, though that part
of their job has some surprising nuance. To be sure, buyers save companies huge
amounts by trolling the world for new, lower-cost sources, and this is certainly a big
reason for their growing stature at many multinationals. But in an era of scarce com-
modities and the risks of disruptions to supply lines posed by terrorist attacks or strik-
ing dockworkers, they also have to make sure they pick dependable sources&mdash;which
might mean choosing the more expensive source just to ensure no disruptions.
</p>
<p>Different functions or groups within any organization must work together to
achieve a wide range of common goals&mdash;from the reduction of product cost and
improved product quality and delivery to the development of innovative new prod-
ucts. Supply management plays an active role in supporting such performance objec-
tives, interacting with and supporting the needs of groups within the organization
and outside of it. How does supply management achieve this? Supply integration
involves professionally managing suppliers and developing close working relation-
ships with different internal groups. The central theme of this chapter is that supply
management must become closely integrated with other internal and external func-
tions in order to develop the capabilities that will lead to improved competitive perfor-
mance. Integration spans a number of areas, including finance, engineering, logistics,
service operations, production, new-product development, and customer service.
</p>
<p>The first section of the chapter defines what we mean by integration. Next we ad-
dress supply management&rsquo;s critical internal and external linkages with various
groups. The third section discusses the need to develop closer and more collaborative
buyer-seller relationships to achieve improved external integration. The fourth sec-
tion discusses the cross-functional sourcing team&mdash;an increasingly important ap-
proach taken to achieve supply management integration. The final section focuses on
supply management&rsquo;s involvement in developing new products and order fulfillment.
</p>
<p>Integration: What Is It?
Integration, a term often heard in the popular press, is in many cases not well
</p>
<p>defined. In this text, we define integration as &ldquo;the process of incorporating or bring-
ing together different groups, functions, or organizations, either formally or infor-
mally, physically or by information technology, to work jointly and often con-
currently on a common business-related assignment or purpose.&rdquo; Although this is
a very broad definition, it implies certain elements. First, that people are coming to-
gether to work together on a problem. It is no surprise that &ldquo;two heads are better
than one&rdquo; when it comes to solving problems, but many enterprises do not apply the

<p>idea of bringing together people with a different point of view to solve a common
problem. This is especially true in a global environment, with team members located
all over the world. Thus, another caveat to this definition involves doing so either
formally or informally, through physical methods or by information technology.
Finally, integration requires that people create a common understanding of the end
goal or purpose; as we will see, this is an important aspect of the success of integration
strategies.
</p>
<p>A recent study of senior executives in the United States and Europe indicated that
integration is at the top of these executives&rsquo; minds, in terms of what will be required
in the future.1 Moreover, when asked about the most critical skills required for sup-
ply management managers in the year 2010, executives did not list some of the more
common elements such as process focus, financial analysis, or efficiency. The single
most important element that senior executives look for is relationship management
(RM) skills, defined as the ability to act ethically, listen effectively, communicate, and
use creative problem solving. The ability to drive relationships is critical for firms seek-
ing to build strong integration with internal business functions, as well as with exter-
nal suppliers.
</p>
<p>Integration can occur in many forms. It can occur through functions, such as in
sourcing or new-product development teams. It can also occur through cross-loca-
tion teams, where people from different business units are brought together. Finally,
the most difficult and challenging form is cross-organizational teams, which involves
working with suppliers, customers, or even both concurrently! Bringing different peo-
ple to the table to work on a problem can provide significant benefits. People will gen-
erally provide input in the form of the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Information
&bull; About their markets
&bull; About their own plans and requirements
</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge and expertise
&bull; Product and service knowledge and technology
&bull; Process knowledge and understanding of how to make it work
</p>
<p>&bull; Business advantages
&bull; Favorable cost structures that can benefit customers
&bull; Economies of scale, which can also help reduce costs
</p>
<p>&bull; Different perspective on an issue, which may drive a team to look at the
problem from a new perspective that they hadn&rsquo;t thought of before
</p>
<p>Some of the different methods that supply management will apply to achieve inte-
gration include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Cross-functional or cross-organizational committees and teams
&bull; Information systems such as videoconferencing and webmail
&bull; Integrated performance objectives and measures that drive a common goal
&bull; Process-focused organizations that are dedicated to certain processes
&bull; Co-location of suppliers and customers
&bull; Buyer or supplier councils that provide input and guidance to a steering
committee

<p>Paradoxically, the very elements of sound supply chain business practice that are the
cornerstones of mature spend management cultures&mdash;and a crucial foundation for
supplier relationship management (SRM)&mdash;can also serve as an anchor holding back
progression to the higher levels of success.
</p>
<p>One part of breaking through is tied to the personal effectiveness of the supply
chain professionals charged with doing the work. Supply management professionals
must begin to work with their internal functions, not against them! This means that
the key building blocks for integration (team-building, communication, and relation-
ship management) will become more important than ever! Let&rsquo;s discuss the first of
these integration elements: internal integration with the functional entities in their
own enterprise!
</p>
<p>Internal Integration
Supply management must maintain a number of communication flows and link-
</p>
<p>ages. Exhibit 4.1 illustrates the two-way linkages between supply management and
other key groups along with a sample of the information exchanged between these
groups. The linkages between supply management and other groups will become
even stronger and more important as the role of supply management continues to de-
velop and evolve.
</p>
<p>Supply Management&rsquo;s Internal Linkages
To facilitate integration with other internal functions, a number of critical commu-
</p>
<p>nication linkages or interfaces have evolved between supply management and other
departments. This need for internal integration has increased exponentially in the
last five years. Many organizations have actively moved toward an outsourced envi-
ronment, and in some cases are sourcing all products through low-cost-country sourc-
ing environments or contract manufacturers. These environments are very different
from North American buyer-seller situations, and supply management must play a
critical role in establishing these agreements and identifying global requirements for
success. Supply management must often work to become part of the global negotia-
tions teams and become involved in supplier qualification, contract management, and
logistics, working with multiple internal parties in the firm including finance, legal,
logistics, marketing, and operations.
</p>
<p>Operations
Supply management has always been a major supporter of the operations group.
</p>
<p>Because the links between operations and supply management have been so close, it
has not been unusual for supply management to report directly to operations. A ma-
jor link between operations and supply management is through the development of
global operations strategy. Because supply management directly supports operations,
it must develop insights into production or service strategic plans. One area in which
supply management has critical input to operations (and marketing) is through the
sales and operations plan, which identifies the level of production and sales for six
months to one year, as well as the required input to execute the plan. Clearly, supply
management&rsquo;s strategies and plans must be aligned with the sales and operations
plan. For example, supply management must be aware of the components and ser-
vices needed by operations as they plan to fulfill customer requirements for products

<p>or services. This could include materials, software, services, travel, hotel, information
technology, and outsourced labor. Because supply management is responsible for
sourcing the inputs to support operation&rsquo;s plans, supply management managers must
work with operations to coordinate the execution to plan.
</p>
<p>Supply management and operations also maintain communication linkages
through direct personnel contact. Many firms are now co-locating supply manage-
ment personnel directly at operating locations so supply management can respond
quickly to operation&rsquo;s needs. For example, in many financial institutions, supply man-
agers are co-located within the strategic business units and provide supplier relation-
ship managers to act as a primary single point of contact between suppliers and the
organization. These managers can work to identify problems, create problem

<p>resolution strategies, and act as a liaison for discussions of service management
expectations.
</p>
<p>Quality Assurance
The supply management&ndash;quality linkage has increased in importance during the
</p>
<p>last 10 years. As firms externally source a larger percentage of finished product re-
quirements, supply management and quality assurance must work together closely to
ensure that suppliers perform as expected. Joint projects involving these two groups
include supplier quality training, process capability studies, and corrective action plan-
ning. This linkage has become so important that some firms have placed the responsi-
bility for supplier quality management directly with supply management. Many firms
now have a dedicated supplier quality management function with a dual reporting ele-
ment to both quality and supply management.
</p>
<p>Engineering
Perhaps the most important and challenging linkages exist between supply manage-
</p>
<p>ment and engineering. The need to develop quality products in less time has drawn
supply management and engineering closer over time. There are still opportunities,
however, to improve the level of interaction between these two groups.
</p>
<p>Firms can create stronger communication linkages and flows between supply
management and engineering in several ways. Engineers and buyers can develop
open communication by working together on product development or supplier selec-
tion teams. Supply management can also co-locate a buyer within the engineering
group. The buyer can maintain direct contact with product and process engineers
to respond quickly to their needs. A firm can also appoint a liaison that coordi-
nates interdepartmental communications and makes sure that each group is aware
of the other group&rsquo;s activities. The two departments can hold regular meetings to re-
port on items of mutual concern. Finally, many supply management groups are re-
cruiting commodity managers with very strong technical backgrounds, who are able
to talk the talk and walk the walk alongside their engineering counterparts. The key
to a successful relationship between supply management and engineering is open
and direct communication, which in turn should lead to increased teamwork and
trust.
</p>
<p>Engineering looks to supply management to perform certain tasks to support en-
gineering&rsquo;s efforts. For example, engineering expects supply management to identify
the most technically and financially capable supplier for an item and to make sure
each supplier meets engineering&rsquo;s quality and delivery targets. In addition, engineer-
ing expects supply management to assess a supplier&rsquo;s production capabilities,
actively involve suppliers early in the design process, and develop relationships that
encourage a supplier to offer innovative ideas. Engineering also expects supply man-
agement to identify sources of new technology that can be integrated into new prod-
ucts and services. It is also important to note that supply and engineering must
work closely together to deal with quality risks that may arise in new products,
such as the example shown in Sourcing Snapshot: Ensuring Quality Requirements:
Batteries from Sony.
</p>
<p>Finally, manufacturing and process engineering will want to ensure ongoing techni-
cal support and service during product launch and ongoing customer order fulfill-
ment, as problems inevitably arise during this phase of the product life cycle as well.

<p>Accounting and Finance
Supply management also maintains linkages with the accounting and finance de-
</p>
<p>partment. These linkages are not as strong, however, as the linkages with operations,
engineering, and quality control. In fact, much of the communication linkage be-
tween supply management and accounting today is electronic. For example, as sup-
ply management transmits material releases to suppliers, it also provides information
concerning inbound material requirements to the accounting department. Upon re-
ceipt of the ordered material, the material control system updates the supply manage-
ment files from on-order or in-transit to a received status. The accounts payable
system then receives the receipt information and compares the amount received to
the amount ordered for payment.
</p>
<p>Supply management may require data from the cost accounting system. For exam-
ple, supply management must know handling and material rework costs for an item re-
sulting from poor supplier performance. Supply management usually does not
maintain data about individual activity costs that can increase total cost. The supply
management performance measurement system relies on input from cost accountants
to help calculate the total cost of an item, which is also important in make-or-buy deci-
sions. Finally, supply management must work closely with finance when making capi-
tal acquisition decisions.
</p>
<p>Marketing/Sales
Supply management maintains indirect linkages with marketing. Many new-
</p>
<p>product ideas that supply management must support start with marketing personnel,
who are the voice of a firm&rsquo;s end customers. Marketing also develops sales forecasts
that convert into production plans. Supply management must select suppliers and
request material to support both marketing and production plans.
</p>
<p>Legal
Supply management often confers with the legal department to seek counsel on
</p>
<p>specific elements of contracts. Issues that may arise include patent ownership terms

<p>Ensuring Quality Require-
ments: Batteries from Sony
</p>
<p>Outsourcing has its risks. Suppliers may misstate their capabilities, their process tech-
nology may be obsolete, or their performance may not meet the buyer&rsquo;s expectations. In other
cases, the supplier may not have the capability to produce the product at the level of quality
required. The most obvious example of this is the Sony battery catastrophe. Major manu-
facturers such as Dell, Apple, and IBM outsourced the power supply for their laptops to Sony.
However, it quickly became apparent that the batteries were defective. When the batteries
were made, the metal case of the cell was crimped, and microscopic shards of metal could
be released into the battery, causing a short circuit that triggered overheating and in some
cases a fire! After several of these incidents, Dell recalled 4.1 million batteries and Apple
recalled 1.9 million batteries. The supplier, in this case Sony, had to recall over 9.6 million
laptop batteries, a problem that has rattled confidence in the company&rsquo;s image. Sony
announced that the recalls of lithium-ion batteries will boost its costs by $429 million
between July and September 2006, which doesn&rsquo;t include provisions for possible lawsuits!

<p>The New Role for Supply
Management in Contracts
</p>
<p>In April 2007, more than 300 delegates joined together at the International Association
of Commercial and Contract Managers (IACCM) Americas Conference (www.iaccm.com/
americas) to debate issues related to contract management and to work together in creating
a framework for the future. Representatives from top universities and business schools
around the world explored cooperation in learning and research.
</p>
<p>The emerging business environment demands increased global awareness and capabilities,
better integration across business functions and external suppliers, and a more collaborative
approach to relationship management. What is the role of the procurement or negotiations
professional? What is the organizational model that will best equip companies for success?
How do we integrate technology, skills, and organizational design to create a winning mix?
</p>
<p>These issues were debated at this conference. Tim Cummins, CEO of IACCM, emphasized the
dynamics of the new global contract management environment:
</p>
<p>The leaders in the community must raise their sights above logistics and pur-
chasing savings, risk, and compliance, to understand the full value chain im-
plications of the global networked economy. They must avoid being obsessed
with tinkering with the mechanics and instead engage in the overall design
of the vehicle. And to do this, they should engage with IACCM and the wider
community it represents. One problem in developing professional status is
that today we are an apparently random mix of job roles and titles&mdash;no one re-
ally thinks of us as a &ldquo;professional community.&rdquo; Yet research shows we pos-
sess very similar skills and knowledge and there is more in common about
the roles we perform than there is that divides us. Indeed, lawyers or doctors
probably have greater differences within their ranks than we do&mdash;yet they
have a composite status. One of the steps we have taken to address this is
to adopt the term &ldquo;commitment management&rdquo; as an overarching title for the
work we perform. Our community identifies, negotiates, documents, and man-
ages the commitments required for successful realization of corporate goals
from its external relationships (supplier, customer, distribution channel, strate-
gic alliance, etc.).
</p>
<p>Another key problem is to escape from the constraining transactional focus of
our work (which creates limited executive interest and results in low visibility)
and instead to be visible in driving strategic performance. That means we
must start collecting more data and accepting greater accountability for busi-
ness outcomes. What process do we own, what results will we commit to moni-
toring, who will we challenge to change their process, rules, capabilities to
ensure greater competitiveness, quality, or efficiency?
</p>
<p>In the end, the market will decide who survives. Our focus must be to drive
the competitiveness of our business through greater speed, innovation, creativ-
ity. We must manage risks, but that means finding new and better ways to
do things so they become less risky, not avoiding doing things because his-
tory or experience tells us they might be risky.

long-term contracts containing escape clauses, and other legal issues. Electronic com-
merce also raises many legal issues that require supply management to consult with
the legal department. Later chapters discuss legal issues in greater detail. Sourcing
Snapshot: The New Role for Supply Management in Contracts illustrates some of the
major challenges that lie ahead, specifically with respect to the role of procurement
on contract management and legal overlapping responsibilities.
</p>
<p>Environmental Management, Health, and Safety
Supply management may also confer with personnel from the environmental,
</p>
<p>health, and safety departments to ensure that suppliers are employing safe methods
of transportation and are complying with Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
tion and safety regulations.
</p>
<p>External Integration
Supply management represents the external face of the organization and also
</p>
<p>serves as the primary vehicle by which to integrate external suppliers and other enti-
ties into the organization. This is done by creating and maintaining linkages with
groups external to the firm&mdash;these linkages are in some respects more important
than supply management&rsquo;s internal linkages.
</p>
<p>Supply Management&rsquo;s External Linkages
Supply management acts as a liaison with external parties on multiple fronts, in-
</p>
<p>cluding materials, new technology, information, and services. These parties include
suppliers, government, and local communities.
</p>
<p>Suppliers
Supply management&rsquo;s primary external linkages are with its suppliers. Supply man-
</p>
<p>agement&rsquo;s primary responsibility is to maintain open communications with suppliers
and select the suppliers with which to do business. Supply management should be
the primary communication linkage with suppliers, although non&ndash;supply manage-
ment personnel may contact a supplier about a particular item or question.
</p>
<p>Supply management has the responsibility to select suppliers and to remain the pri-
mary commercial linkage with the buying firm, including any matter involving the
conditions of the purchase agreement or other issues of importance. Non&ndash;supply
management departments should not select, independently work with, or directly ne-
gotiate with potential suppliers for items for which the supply management depart-
ment is responsible.
</p>
<p>Government
Supply management sometimes maintains communication linkages with govern-
</p>
<p>ments at different levels and locations. For example, supply management has an ac-
tive role in international countertrade and often negotiates directly with foreign
governments when establishing countertrade agreements. Supply management may
also need to consult with federal government agencies on various matters, including
the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Defense, the Department

<p>of External Affairs, and other agencies that have authority over issues governed by
public policy.
</p>
<p>Local Communities
Supply management may have contact with local communities and leaders. Be-
</p>
<p>cause supply management controls a large budget, it has the potential to affect cer-
tain social goals. These goals include sourcing from local suppliers, awarding a
certain percentage of business to qualified minority suppliers, and establishing ethical
business practices in all dealings.
</p>
<p>Collaborative Buyer-Seller Relationships
Most purchasers and sellers now recognize a need for joint cooperation to achieve
</p>
<p>cost, quality, delivery, and time improvements. During the 1980s, progressive pur-
chasers eliminated poor or marginal suppliers from their supply base. They then de-
veloped collaborative relationships or alliances with many of the remaining suppliers.
</p>
<p>Collaboration is defined as the process by which two or more parties adopt a high
level of purposeful cooperation to maintain a trading relationship over time. The rela-
tionship is bilateral; both parties have the power to shape its nature and future direc-
tion over time. Mutual commitment to the future and a balanced power relationship
are essential to the process. Although collaborative relationships are not devoid of con-
flict, they build mechanisms into the relationship for managing conflict.2
</p>
<p>The following characteristics define a collaborative buyer-seller relationship:
</p>
<p>&bull; One or a limited number of suppliers for each purchased item or family of
items. Remaining suppliers often provide material under long-term contracts
with agreed-upon performance improvement targets.
</p>
<p>&bull; A win-win approach to reward sharing.
&bull; Joint efforts to improve supplier performance across all critical performance
areas.
</p>
<p>&bull; Joint efforts to resolve disputes.
&bull; Open exchange of information. This includes information about new prod-
ucts, supplier cost data, and production schedules and forecasts for pur-
chased items.
</p>
<p>&bull; A credible commitment to work together during difficult times. In other
words, a purchaser does not return to old practices at the first sign of
trouble.
</p>
<p>&bull; A commitment to quality, defect-free products having design specifications
that are manufacturable and that the supplier&rsquo;s process is capable of
producing.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 4.2 compares the characteristics of traditional and collaborative buyer-
seller relationships. Although not all relationships between purchasers and suppliers
should be collaborative, the trend is toward greater use of the collaborative approach.
</p>
<p>Advantages of Closer Buyer-Seller Relationships
A firm can gain many advantages by pursuing closer relationships with suppliers.
</p>
<p>The first is the development of mutual trust, which is the foundation of all strong
relationships.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Trust
Although trust seems intangible, it refers to the belief in the character, ability,
</p>
<p>strength, and truthfulness of another party. Trust makes it possible, for example, for
the seller to share cost data with a buyer, which can result in a joint effort to reduce
a supplier&rsquo;s cost through a mutual sharing of ideas. Trust can also result in a supplier
working with a purchaser early in the design of a new product.
</p>
<p>Long-Term Contracts
Another advantage of closer buyer-seller relationships is the opportunity to evalu-
</p>
<p>ate which suppliers should receive longer-term contracts. Purchaser and seller both re-
alize benefits from longer-term contracts. A long-term contract provides an incentive
for a supplier to invest in new plants and equipment. This investment can make a sup-
plier more efficient and result in lower costs to the purchaser. Longer-term contracts
can also lead to the joint development of technology, risk sharing, and supplier capa-
bilities (see Sourcing Snapshot: Suncor Energy Partners with Drilling Suppliers).
</p>
<p>Obstacles to Closer Buyer-Seller Relationships
A number of obstacles can prevent the development of closer relationships between
</p>
<p>a purchaser and a seller. A firm must evaluate whether these obstacles are present and
identify ways to overcome them if the goal is to pursue closer interfirm cooperation.
</p>
<p>Confidentiality
The need for confidentiality regarding financial, product, and process information
</p>
<p>is the most frequently cited reason for not developing closer supplier relationships.
Supply management managers are sometimes reluctant to share critical information
with suppliers that may also sell to competitors. There is also the possibility that a sup-
plier is a direct competitor or may become one in the future.
</p>
<p>Limited Interest by Suppliers
Closer relationships may not interest all suppliers. A supplier may have the
</p>
<p>leverage or power in some relationships, particularly when it is in a monopolistic or

<p>Suncor Energy Partners
with Drilling Suppliers
</p>
<p>In the oil and gas exploration business, a successful exploration and development dril-
ling program requires strong performance from a multidisciplinary team, as well as active
participation and support from many suppliers and contractors. Suncor Energy is a diversi-
fied oil and gas company based in Calgary, Alberta. As part of its strategic supplier relation-
ship program, the Suncor Foothills Drilling-Asset Team was formed; it includes people from
the drilling department and the Foothills Asset Team, as well as contractors and suppliers.
This team drills mainly in the foothills of the Canadian Rocky Mountains.
</p>
<p>The drilling business is traditionally very cyclical and somewhat secretive, with most of the
actual drilling being outsourced to groups of specialized service suppliers. The on-again, off-
again nature of the work can significantly damage service quality and expertise. Often the
staffing of a drilling effort is determined by who is available, not by who is the best fit. The
secretive nature of the business amplifies the difficulties of the service suppliers by the lack
of information available for planning, forecasting, and workload leveling. To drill a well, mate-
rials and services are required from approximately 20 different suppliers. Often the informa-
tion used by the service supplier is subject to change and can oftentimes be incorrect.
Changes in timing or design can impact each of these suppliers significantly.
</p>
<p>In addition to the coordination issues listed above, the technical issues related to drilling
deep sour gas wells are also highly significant. Suncor has drilled wells as deep as 6400 m,
with horizontal sections close to 2000 m in length. In the last five years the Foothills Drilling-
Asset Team has drilled approximately 50 wells throughout the Alberta Foothills. In mountain-
ous regions, expertise and extensive area experience go hand-in-hand with successfully drilling
wells. Drilling techniques downhole have to be adapted to very challenging mountainous-
type conditions. Poor drilling execution can result in safety concerns, increased costs, and lower
capital returns. Even when drilling techniques are well executed, the Foothills challenges can
result in significant timing fluctuations that can affect the entire supply chain network.
</p>
<p>In order to overcome these challenges, a total integration of objectives was initiated to cre-
ate greater influence on the factors affecting drilling performance. In essence, a greater
team concept was created with one common center and full alignment. Team integration be-
tween the drilling group and the Foothills Drilling-Asset Team has extended further than previ-
ously documented for the industry. This integration has also been extended to a number of
contractor services. The greater team concept has created a high trust environment that al-
lows for accelerated learning and has enhanced integrated expertise. As a result, the key ser-
vice suppliers and the different groups from Suncor work together as though they were one
company with one set of objectives.
</p>
<p>The implementation of this unified philosophy in all phases of the life cycle, as well as the
creation of an environment of openness, trust, and mutual success, has resulted in substan-
tial improvements. Based on a 2003 cost study, the team has achieved the following: (1) drill-
ing costs reduced by 18% ($1.4 million/well), (2) planning times reduced by 42%
(five months), (3) drilling times reduced by 20% on average, and (4) 80%-plus success rate
on wells drilled. In addition, Foothills production volumes have tripled over the past five
years. These results have been accomplished against a backdrop of 5% inflation. Suncor&rsquo;s
Foothills Drilling-Asset Team has become one of the preferred employers from the service sup-
plier perspective within its operating region. This position continues to strengthen.

<p>oligopolistic industry position. In such cases, the purchaser may be unable to pursue
a closer relationship simply because of the relative sizes or power positions of the
two firms.
</p>
<p>Legal Barriers
In some industries, legal antitrust concerns may act as barriers or obstacles to
</p>
<p>closer buyer-seller relationships (covered in greater detail in Chapter 16, which dis-
cusses the legal aspects of supply management).
</p>
<p>Resistance to Change
Entire generations of supply management professionals grew up using an arm&rsquo;s-
</p>
<p>length approach. A shift toward a more trusting approach is not easy. Resistance to
change is a powerful force that takes time, patience, and training to overcome. Also,
firms that practice traditional supply chain management may not have the skills or
knowledge in their workforce to evolve toward closer supplier relationships.
</p>
<p>An example of how buyer-supplier teams can work together, despite the odds, to
create mutually beneficial outcomes is described in Sourcing Snapshot: Suncor En-
ergy Partners with Drilling Suppliers.
</p>
<p>Critical Elements for Supplier Relationship
Management
</p>
<p>Recent research conducted by Ward, Handfield, and Cousins based on interviews
with executives revealed the following critical elements for building effective supply
relationships.3
</p>
<p>Focus on deliverables at the level of the product or service, not the centralized
relationship that occurs at an abstract level and fails to get into the details of the
business performance metrics. Too often, thoughts about SRM start with discussions
about global contracts or broad-based partnering marketing initiatives. Although
these can be seductive, they rarely produce sufficient short-term payoff to sustain the
level of effort required to maintain focus on the initiative. Instead, as one group-level
category manager said, &ldquo;You need to provide short-term payoff on the basics before
leaping into the other neat stuff. Our job is to make it a pull, not a push.&rdquo;4
</p>
<p>&bull; Start with the business outcome at the business unit level. This means defin-
ing a specific measurable performance indicator that means something to
the business stakeholder (e.g., operational cost savings, supply continuity,
process improvement suggestions, access to new technology, or process
innovation).
</p>
<p>&bull; Let the business outcome drive the relationship process, course of action,
and level of investment through initiation of projects focused on achieving
the outcome.
</p>
<p>&bull; The overall relationship (Big R) then becomes an outcome of various re-
lationships with different products and services that meet different business
outcomes (little r&rsquo;s).
</p>
<p>&bull; Program management (Big R) drives incongruity resolution, aggregation of
benefits, and opportunity analysis across lines of business.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Business cases must be clearly understood and compelling at all levels. Although
well-intentioned efforts sometimes get off the ground because the business case is intu-
itively obvious, these efforts often are the first to founder in tougher times. Explicit
documentation of time, efforts, and investments against projected payoffs is an essen-
tial component of success. A site-level procurement person who managed the little r
at his location put it this way: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to understand their strategic priorities and
day-to-day pressures, make sure there is a direct line of sight between what we are ask-
ing them to do and how it will support their performance objectives.&rdquo;5
</p>
<p>&bull; Specific benefits to supplier and buyer need to be outlined with clear criteria
for success and a realistic timeline for assessing leading and lagging indica-
tor metrics.
</p>
<p>&bull; Benefits need to be weighed against a realistic assessment of costs of adopt-
ing a different way of working and the time and resource investment re-
quired to realize the benefits.
</p>
<p>&bull; Soft benefits should be rolled up to believable metrics that are meaningful to
business units. Metrics need not always be financial, but need to be compel-
ling and strategically important.
</p>
<p>&bull; Metrics should conform to existing available data; gathering the data should
not be an additional hardship
</p>
<p>External RM starts with internal RM; internal alignment is key. SRM will expose
and even magnify the fault lines in an organization&rsquo;s structure and alignment. Al-
though governance models for SRM have been much discussed, they are often used
to mask fundamental conflicts or gaps in accountabilities and responsibilities. In to-
day&rsquo;s heavily matrixed environments, perfect alignment is neither possible nor desir-
able. Instead, procurement executives need to be conscious of the hot spots and
tensions and have plans in place to manage through them.
</p>
<p>An exasperated category manager discussing his company&rsquo;s SRM failings noted,
&ldquo;Do you have an appetite for the culture change this requires? Planning, sharing, hav-
ing real dialogue, and investing the time and resources to engage at each level with
real teams, and open communication? In our case the answer was no.&rdquo;6 To avoid this
type of negative outcome, SRM initiatives should consider the following approach:
</p>
<p>&bull; Start with how a firm interacts with itself; where are the functional silos, and
who are the key decision makers at each level who determine the course of
action?
</p>
<p>&bull; Once identified, internal conflicts between stakeholder needs within different
functional silos need to be resolved before trying to change or refocus
externally.
</p>
<p>&bull; Once established, procurement should become the initial point of contact to
make and deliver on supplier commitments, but then it needs to drive the
relationship into each business and transition into a facilitator role.
</p>
<p>&bull; Relationship management governance needs engaged relationship managers.
Ideally, the business line sponsors focus on the achievement of little r busi-
ness outcomes, with dedicated procurement resource leaders and senior busi-
ness executive sponsors focused on Big R enterprisewide coordination.
</p>
<p>Engineer change into the process; keep structure and key performance indicators
(KPIs) dynamic. SRM is by definition a multiyear, long-horizon effort, at least at the

<p>Big R level. But businesses rarely have the discipline to manage beyond pressures for
short-term results. Rather than try to swim against the tide, SRM advocates would do
well to remember that for most business executives, &ldquo;if it doesn&rsquo;t work in the short
term, there may be no long term.&rdquo; The need to meet short-term goals is an impor-
tant component of successful program management; each relationship must be tuned
to emerging and shifting business priorities.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, as one procurement executive said, &ldquo;The big guys stop showing up at
the meetings, you keep measuring things nobody cares about anymore, and it be-
comes just another piece of work.&rdquo;7
</p>
<p>In managing both internal and external relationships, some of the key points to
keep in mind include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Different stages of SRM require different people and skills and levels of in-
vestment and attention; the people needed to jump-start the effort may not
be the best ones to nurture, manage, and sustain it.
</p>
<p>&bull; Recruit from the business. The best supplier relationship managers are those
who have worked in the business, understand the day-to-day pressures, and
speak the same technical vernacular. These individuals can align the busi-
ness realities for stakeholders and suppliers with the opportunities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor internal and external shifts, and establish mechanisms that facilitate
readjustment in roles, metrics, and project deliverables.
</p>
<p>&bull; Schedule regular site-level meetings with suppliers and stakeholders to re-
evaluate and revise KPIs to reflect current business priorities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Drive people to insight and to commitment; as one executive noted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
business relationship, not a marriage.&rdquo; Be willing to cut bait on people or
directions that aren&rsquo;t in alignment with strategy.
</p>
<p>The Critical Role of Cross-Functional
Sourcing Teams
</p>
<p>The pressure to improve, already intense, is expected to increase even more in the
years ahead. Many firms are responding to this pressure by creating organizational
structures that promote cross-functional and cross-organizational communication, co-
ordination, and collaboration. In support of this effort, cross-functional sourcing
teams have become increasingly important as firms pursue leading-edge supply man-
agement strategies and practices.
</p>
<p>Cross-functional sourcing teams consist of personnel from different functions and, in-
creasingly, suppliers, brought together to achieve supply management or supply
chain&ndash;related tasks. This includes specific tasks such as product design or supplier
selection, or broader tasks such as responsibility for reducing purchased item cost or
improving quality.
</p>
<p>When executed properly, the cross-functional sourcing team approach can bring
together the knowledge and resources required for responding to new sourcing de-
mands, something that rigid organizational structures are often incapable of doing.
Prior researchers on team-building, such as Likert, have noted that groups and teams
can accomplish much that is good, or they can do great harm. There is nothing

members) presents a special challenge. It is often a struggle to obtain the commit-
ment of members who have other professional responsibilities. Experience reveals
that cross-functional sourcing teams are usually part-time/continuous assignments,
making the use of sourcing teams a challenging way to work.
</p>
<p>The following discussion of sourcing teams examines the benefits and potential
drawbacks to team interaction, identifies when to form a cross-functional team
(CFT), and concludes with a set of questions and answers that will explain how to
make sourcing teams effective.
</p>
<p>Benefits Sought from the Cross-Functional
Team Approach
</p>
<p>Firms commit the energy needed to form teams to realize specific performance
benefits. When cross-functional teams meet their performance objectives, the benefits
can far outweigh the cost of using teams. The following highlights some of the bene-
fits that organizations hope to realize from cross-functional sourcing teams.

<p>Reduced Time to Complete a Task
Individuals working as a team can often reduce the time required to solve a prob-
</p>
<p>lem or complete an assigned task. The traditional approach to completing organiza-
tional tasks often requires duplication of effort between groups, and the individual
sign-off of different functional groups may take an extended period of time. The
team approach supports members reaching agreement together, which can result in
reduced rework and the time required to execute a decision.
</p>
<p>Increased Innovation
Firms look to teams to develop innovative products and processes to maintain an
</p>
<p>advantage over competitors. Innovation is critical to long-term success. Research has
revealed that lower levels of formal rules and procedures along with informal organi-
zational structures support increased levels of innovation.8
</p>
<p>The team approach should require fewer formal rules and qualifies as a less for-
mal organizational structure. Teams can be a means to encourage increased innova-
tion among members.
</p>
<p>Joint Ownership of Decisions
The team approach requires joint agreement and ownership of decisions among
</p>
<p>different members. Through team interaction, members begin to understand each oth-
er&rsquo;s requirements or limitations and develop solutions that different departments can
support. Perhaps the greatest benefit of team interaction is that once a team makes a
decision, implementing the decision often becomes easier due to group buy-in. The
stakeholders involved in carrying out the decision are more likely to do so efficiently
and effectively, because the team has established cross-functional agreement and own-
ership regarding the change or decision.
</p>
<p>Enhanced Communication between Functions or Organizations
Those who have worked in an organization with rigidly separated departments
</p>
<p>know the inefficiencies associated with interdepartmental communication. The prob-
lems are even worse as parties attempt to communicate across organizations. The
cross-functional team approach can help reduce communication barriers because
members are in direct contact with each other (either face to face or by electronic com-
munication). For example, the team approach can help reduce design or material
changes during product development because the team works together when develop-
ing product specifications. This cross-functional team approach, by design, en-
courages open and timely exchange of information between members.
</p>
<p>Realizing Synergies by Combining Individuals and Functions
A primary objective of using teams is to bring together individuals with different
</p>
<p>perspectives and expertise to perform better on a task compared to individuals or de-
partments acting alone. The synergistic effect of team interaction can help generate
new and creative ways to look at a problem or approach a task. Ideally, a team works
together to solve problems that individuals could not solve as well acting alone, to
create new ways to perform routine (though time-consuming) tasks, and to develop
ideas that only a diverse group could develop.
</p>
<p>Better Identification and Resolution of Problems

</p>
<p>causes of problems that may affect the team or the organization. Early problem

<p>identification and correction minimizes or even prevents a problem&rsquo;s total impact.
Furthermore, a team should assume joint ownership of problems and accept the re-
sponsibility for problem correction, which helps prevent finger-pointing for blame be-
tween departments.
</p>
<p>The Need to Build Internal Relationships through Teams
Research9 suggests that supply management professionals may, indeed, be placed
</p>
<p>in some of the most interpersonally demanding situations of any occupational group
studied. Success depends upon the ability to navigate organizational fault lines with
facility and interpersonal sophistication akin to that of the best general managers&mdash;
without the organizational clout to back it up. Some of the comments below from
supply management senior executives reflect the recognition of this need to create a
tighter bridge between procurement professionals and business stakeholders.10
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;A number of our people have the perception that once the contract is
done, you put it in the drawer. . . . We have no culture of continuous man-
agement and measurement, so this level of engagement is new for us.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got to believe that we know we are only in service to the business.
There&rsquo;s a credibility gap and we&rsquo;ve got to change the quality of the conversa-
tion, change the way we present information.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give us procurement SRM tools without investing the time and
money to help us adapt it to our business and make sure we know how to
use it. And you can&rsquo;t even use the tools until you can earn a seat at the ta-
ble! How&rsquo;re we supposed to do that?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Critically, SRM means learning to exercise a new kind of power, one not
grounded in the ability to force compliance with procurement procedures and con-
tracting processes. Instead, procurement executives need to learn to build relation-
ship capital that inspires trust and commitment from stakeholders and suppliers.
Relationship capital is a function of the professional&rsquo;s ability to translate supply mar-
ket data into compelling insights that solve business problems and to enable organiza-
tional connections and networking that accelerate business success.
</p>
<p>Potential Drawbacks to the Cross-Functional
Team Approach
</p>
<p>The use of cross-functional sourcing teams does not guarantee a successful out-
come to a project or assignment. The team approach requires careful management,
open exchange of information between members, motivated team members, clearly
understood team goals, effective team leaders, and adequate resources. There are po-
tential drawbacks to the team approach when conditions do not support an effective
team effort. Supply management managers must be willing to address these draw-
backs if they begin to affect team performance.
</p>
<p>Team Process Loss
Process loss occurs when a team does not complete its task in the best or most effi-
</p>
<p>cient manner or members are not motivated to employ their resources to create a suc-
cessful outcome.11 When process loss is present, the total group effort is less than the
expected sum of the individual parts. There is a potential drawback if the benefits re-
sulting from team interaction do not outweigh team process loss. For example, a

<p/>

<p>supplier selection team with 12 members, 5 of whom are active on the team, would ex-
perience a loss and waste from a lack of team interaction and participation.
</p>
<p>Negative Effects on Individual Members
Membership on a team can have negative effects on individuals. Teams can exert
</p>
<p>pressure to conform to a decision or position that the member does not support. An
example might involve a materials engineer who is pressured by other team members
to select the lowest-price supplier, even though he or she knows that a higher-priced
supplier will provide better quality.
</p>
<p>A team may also pressure an individual to support or conform to a lower produc-
tivity norm than the individual&rsquo;s personal norm. Also, some individuals may feel sti-
fled in a team setting or may not interact well with other team members. When this
occurs, individual performance suffers.
</p>
<p>Poor Team Decisions
Although it seems counter to what we popularly believe, cross-functional teams
</p>
<p>can arrive at poor decisions. Groupthink&mdash;the tendency of a rational group or team to
arrive at a bad decision when other information is available &mdash;may become a prob-
lem for individuals in a cohesive group. By striving for group uniformity and consen-
sus, they may suppress their motivation to appraise alternative courses of action.12
</p>
<p>The team may arrive at a decision that careful evaluation of all available information
or critical discussion normally would not support.
</p>
<p>When to Form a Cross-Functional Team
All organizations face resource constraints that affect the number of cross-
</p>
<p>functional teams, including sourcing teams, they can establish. Clearly, a firm cannot
use the team approach for every business decision. Certain business decisions simply
do not require a team approach. A team approach is useful when the task at hand
satisfies certain characteristics.
</p>
<p>A firm faced with a complex or large-scale business decision should consider the
cross-functional team approach. Examples include new-product development, locat-
ing a new production facility, developing a commodity or purchase family strategy,
or establishing a new business unit. These tasks are so large or complex that one per-
son or function cannot effectively accomplish the assignment. A firm can also use the
team approach when a team is likely to arrive at a better solution than a person or de-
partment acting individually. For example, supply management may be able to han-
dle the evaluation and selection of suppliers but may benefit from a team with
diverse experience whose members are better equipped to evaluate suppliers from a
number of perspectives. Engineering can provide technical specifications, marketing
can provide details on the features required, accounting can provide material and la-
bor cost data estimates, and so on. In these situations, selecting a better supplier(s)
for the situation at hand is more likely as better information becomes available and is
analyzed by team members.
</p>
<p>An assignment that directly affects a firm&rsquo;s competitive position, such as negotia-
tion with a joint venture partner, might also benefit from the team approach. The
cross-functional team approach is also useful when no single function has the re-
sources to solve a problem that affects more than one department or function.

<p>Improving Sourcing Team Effectiveness
The remainder of our team discussion presents a set of questions that require stu-
</p>
<p>dents and managers to think about various issues that affect the quality of sourcing
team interaction and performance. Each question includes a brief discussion of major
points and insights related to that question.
</p>
<p>Question 1: Does Our Organization Consider Cross-Functional Team
Planning Issues When Establishing Sourcing Teams?
</p>
<p>Successfully using teams requires extensive planning before a team should be al-
lowed to pursue an assignment. Ignoring these issues or the needs of team members
during team formation increases the risk of team failure. The following summarizes
several sourcing team planning issues.
</p>
<p>Selecting a Task
Organizations should use teams selectively due to limited resource availability.
</p>
<p>Sourcing teams should work only on tasks that are important to an organization&rsquo;s suc-
cess. One expert recommends selecting tasks that are meaningful. A meaningful task is
one that requires members to use a variety of higher-level skills, supports giving mem-
bers regular feedback about performance, results in an outcome with a significant af-
fect on the organization and others outside the team, and provides members
autonomy for deciding how they will do the work. For example, reducing purchase
cost is an example of a broad performance objective.
</p>
<p>Selecting Team Members and Leaders
Perhaps one of the most critical planning issues involves selecting the right mem-
</p>
<p>bers and leader. An effective team member is one who meets the following
requirements:
</p>
<p>&bull; Understands the team&rsquo;s task&mdash;the member has task-relevant knowledge
&bull; Has the time to commit to the team
&bull; Has the ability to work with others in a group
&bull; Can assume an organizational rather than strict functional perspective
</p>
<p>Training Requirements
Interacting as a team requires a set of skills different from the skills required for
</p>
<p>traditional work. Organizations must consider carefully the training requirements of
sourcing team members. Members may require training in project management, con-
flict resolution, consensus decision making, group problem solving, goal setting, and
effective communication and listening skills.
</p>
<p>Resource Support
An earlier study of cross-functional sourcing teams by Monczka and Trent re-
</p>
<p>vealed that the types of resources that cross-functional sourcing teams had access to
made a major difference in team performance.13 Adapted from work by Peters and
O&rsquo;Connor, we can identify 10 categories of team resources, as presented in Exhibit
4.4.14 The resources that correlate the highest, on average, with effective sourcing
teams (in order of importance) are supplier participation, required services and help
from others, time availability, and budgetary support. Budgetary support is especially

<p>critical for teams whose members must travel from different geographical areas or for
teams that must visit suppliers during the course of their assignment.
</p>
<p>Other planning issues not addressed here include determining the level of sourc-
ing team authority, the types and frequency of team evaluations and rewards, and the
physical location of team members. This list of planning issues reveals that organiza-
tions must give serious attention to some important considerations before allowing
sourcing teams to begin work.
</p>
<p>Question 2: Does Executive Management Practice Subtle Control
over Sourcing Teams?
</p>
<p>A major issue involves management&rsquo;s willingness to exert subtle control over
cross-functional sourcing teams, a process that does not mean that management

<p>dictates or supervises team activities. Instead, subtle control involves activities under-
taken by management to increase the probability of team success. There are several
ways that management can practice subtle control over sourcing teams:
</p>
<p>&bull; Authorizing the creation of the sourcing team
&bull; Selecting the team&rsquo;s task
&bull; Establishing broad objectives (with the team later establishing specific perfor-
mance targets or goals)
</p>
<p>&bull; Selecting the team leader and members
&bull; Requiring performance updates at regular intervals or at key milestones
(What team wants to report to executive management that they have made
no progress?)
</p>
<p>&bull; Conducting performance reviews and holding teams accountable for perfor-
mance outcomes
</p>
<p>Although management does not involve itself in a team&rsquo;s day-to-day activities,
management must concern itself with moving the sourcing team process forward.
</p>
<p>Question 3: Does Our Organization Recognize and Reward Team
Member Participation and Team Performance?
</p>
<p>A direct link exists between rewards and team member effort, and also between re-
wards and team performance. Unfortunately, many organizations still fail to recog-
nize the time and effort members must commit to sourcing teams, particularly
members of part-time teams. This lack of recognition often causes team members to
commit their time to non-team work activities.
</p>
<p>How should organizations recognize and reward team member participation and
team performance? Although no single answer exists, there are some guidelines that
will help in this area. First, team membership should be part of an individual&rsquo;s perfor-
mance review. This sends a message that team participation is valued and recognized
by the organization, just like an individual&rsquo;s other work responsibilities. Second,
along with an evaluation of the entire team&rsquo;s performance, management should
consider assessing each individual&rsquo;s contribution to the team. This helps ensure that
nonparticipating members do not benefit unfairly from the efforts of other team
members.
</p>
<p>Rewards and recognition that organizations offer teams cluster into four broad
categories:
</p>
<p>&bull; Executive recognition, including plaques or mention in the company
newsletter
</p>
<p>&bull; Monetary bonuses and other one-time cash awards
&bull; Nonmonetary rewards, including dinners or sports and theater tickets
&bull; Merit raises awarded during the team member&rsquo;s annual performance review
</p>
<p>Rewards offer an opportunity to reinforce desired activity and behavior. It is well
understood that what gets rewarded gets done. If team members are positively re-
inforced for high performance, they will likely exert even greater effort. Furthermore,
if members receive immediate reinforcement, they will exert greater effort than if the
reinforcement is delayed. If positive work is never recognized or reinforced through
rewards, the positive effort will likely be extinguished.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Question 4: Do We Have the Right Individuals Selected as the
Sourcing Team Leader?
</p>
<p>The previously mentioned research by Monczka and Trent found that the effective-
ness of the sourcing team leader is one of the strongest predictors of team success.
An additional finding from that research was that most sourcing teams had formally
designated leaders who usually were selected by management (see Question 3 on sub-
tle control). Zenger and his colleagues, in extensive research with teams, found the fol-
lowing to be true:15
</p>
<p>&bull; Most organizations report they should give more attention, training, and
support to their team leaders.
</p>
<p>&bull; Within days of taking a leadership role, team leaders usually realize they
need a new set of skills.
</p>
<p>&bull; Even when shared team leadership among members is the goal, the team as
a whole still reports to someone who might need advanced team-leadership
skills.
</p>
<p>&bull; Overly structured team leaders who see themselves as &ldquo;top sergeants with a
few extra duties&rdquo; greatly increase the chance of team failure.
</p>
<p>We may conclude that selecting and training an effective team leader is critical to
team success. Being an effective team leader means satisfying a demanding set of es-
sential operating responsibilities and requirements while still promoting the creativ-
ity, leadership ability, and cohesiveness of team members. Unfortunately, relatively
few individuals have the qualifications, experience, or training to immediately assume
such a demanding leadership position.
</p>
<p>Organizations should (1) evaluate team leader strengths and weaknesses; (2) rank
team leaders, which is valuable when considering future leadership responsibilities;
(3) provide feedback regarding improvement opportunities, which can lead to train-
ing that is targeted to the specific needs of the leader; and (4) allow individual lead-
ers, teams, and organizations to take corrective action as required. A failure to select
a qualified individual as team leader greatly reduces the probability of sourcing team
effectiveness.
</p>
<p>Question 5: Do Our Sourcing Teams Effectively Establish
Performance Goals?
</p>
<p>One of the most important activities relating to sourcing team interaction is the
ability of teams to establish quantified goals that focus on end results (rather than de-
sired activities). For example, a sourcing team that establishes a goal of 2% cost reduc-
tion for the first quarter of 2005 has likely established a more effective goal than one
that establishes a goal of holding three team meetings in the first quarter.
</p>
<p>Establishing sourcing team goals is important for several reasons. Teams with
established goals often use those goals as a basis for evaluating how well the team is
performing. The goals provide a benchmark for assessing progress, providing feed-
back, and allocating performance rewards for superior effort and results. Teams will
also establish, on average, challenging rather than easy goals. Furthermore, external
pressure on a team to set goals usually results in the setting of more challenging
goals (recall our discussion of subtle control). We also know that teams with goals
perform better, on average, than teams that are asked simply to perform their best

<p>without explicit end goals. Goal setting is a critical cross-functional team
requirement.
</p>
<p>Sourcing teams should develop goals for which they will be held accountable. This
is a three-part process. The first part of the process requires a team to describe its
task. For example, a team may be responsible for managing suppliers that provide a
certain commodity. The second part of the process requires the team to assess its abil-
ity to achieve certain outcomes on a scale ranging from 1 (no potential) to 7 (high po-
tential). Finally, the team identifies those areas offering the highest performance
potential (usually the items within the 5&ndash;7 range) and develops quantified or specific
objectives relating to that item. If the team believes it has the potential to improve ma-
terial delivery, then it should develop an objective goal that relates to material
delivery.
</p>
<p>Question 6: Are Key Suppliers Part of the Sourcing Team Process?
The potential benefit of closer buyer-seller relationships is well understood by
</p>
<p>most organizations. Cross-functional sourcing teams are an ideal way to promote
cross-organizational cooperation. Research reveals that relying on supplier involve-
ment and input (when a team&rsquo;s assignment warrants involvement) demonstrates, on
average, the following positive characteristics compared with teams that do not in-
volve suppliers:16
</p>
<p>&bull; They are rated as more effective than teams that do not involve suppliers.
&bull; They are rated as putting forth greater effort on team assignments than
teams that do not involve suppliers.
</p>
<p>&bull; They report greater satisfaction concerning the quality of key information ex-
changed between the team and key suppliers.
</p>
<p>&bull; They report greater reliance on suppliers to directly support the team&rsquo;s
goals, thus making the supplier a resource.
</p>
<p>&bull; They report fewer problems coordinating work activity between the team
and key suppliers.
</p>
<p>&bull; They report receiving greater supplier contribution across many perfor-
mance areas, including cost-reduction and quality improvement ideas, pro-
cess improvement suggestions, and material-ordering and delivery cycle time
reductions.
</p>
<p>An integrated approach to supply chain management should also begin to identify
key customers that should be part of sourcing teams (at least on an informal basis).
Sourcing teams, with supplier involvement, can work to incorporate customer needs
directly into sourcing strategies and practices.
</p>
<p>Cross-functional sourcing teams offer all types of organizations, not just manu-
facturing firms, the opportunity to realize advantages across many performance
areas. Underlying the development and use of sourcing teams must be a recognition
that sourcing increasingly affects a firm&rsquo;s overall competitiveness along with the reali-
zation that cross-functional integration among supply management, manufacturing,
marketing, and technical groups can improve a firm&rsquo;s sourcing effectiveness.

<p>Integrating Supply Management, Engineering, and
Suppliers to Develop New Products and Services
</p>
<p>In forward-thinking enterprises, supply management plays a key role in the devel-
opment of new products and services. As the main contact with suppliers, supply
management is in a unique position to include suppliers early in the design process
as well as to perform early evaluation of supplier capabilities. This is a task that engi-
neering team members are not trained to do. Think about how much easier it is for
supply management to support new-product development teams than for engineering
to do it alone! As a team member, supply management has early visibility to new-
product requirements, which allows managers to contribute directly during the de-
sign and specification of material requirements. With a more traditional approach,
supply management plays a reactive role after other functions have completed their
tasks. Because supply management knows more about supplier capabilities, it is a valu-
able resource for engineering staff faced with understanding the capabilities of suppli-
ers, as well as the new and emerging technologies that lie on the horizon and are
within reach of current or new suppliers.
</p>
<p>Common Themes of Successful Supplier
Integration Efforts
</p>
<p>A recent study17 funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) identified the
key factors that distinguished successful from unsuccessful attempts at involving sup-
pliers in new-product development. The following key attributes of successful sup-
plier integration initiatives were common among all of the companies studied, as
shown in Exhibit 4.5 on p. 138.
</p>
<p>1. Formalized Process for Selecting Items for Supplier Integration
Supply management&rsquo;s involvement enables it to determine at an earlier point the
</p>
<p>materials or service requirements for a new product and provide input during the de-
sign phase based on its knowledge of materials supply markets. Supply management
can recommend substitutes for high-cost or volatile materials, suggest standard items
wherever possible, and evaluate longer-term materials trends. However, as we noted
in Chapter 3, the right to make this decision must be formally authorized in the
new-product development process, with supply management given the appropriate
level of authority.
</p>
<p>Supply management should always monitor and anticipate activity in its supply
markets. For example, supply management should forecast long-term supply and
prices for its basic commodities. It should monitor technological innovations that im-
pact its primary materials or make substitute materials economically attractive. It
should evaluate not only its existing suppliers but other potential suppliers. Because
team participation provides timely visibility to new-product requirements, supply
management can monitor and forecast change on a continuous basis.
</p>
<p>2. Use of Cross-Functional Team for Supplier Evaluation and Selection
The evaluation and selection of suppliers requires a major time commitment by

<p>management to anticipate product requirements earlier so it can identify the most
capable suppliers.
</p>
<p>The supplier assessment should be systematically carried out, based on hard perfor-
mance data, by a cross-functional team of technical and non-technical personnel who
conduct subjective evaluations. Performance data should be weighted in such a man-
ner that they are aligned with customer performance requirements. All of the above
criteria must be tied into the evaluation/measurement system in order to develop a
comprehensive risk assessment that answers the following questions:
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the likelihood that this supplier has the ability to bring the product
to market?
</p>
<p>&bull; How does this risk assessment compare to other potential suppliers (if there
are others)?
</p>
<p>&bull; At what point are we willing to reverse this decision if we proceed, and
what are the criteria and measures for doing so?
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the contingency plan that takes effect in the event of reversing our
decision?
</p>
<p>3. Early Supplier Selection for Design and Volume Work
Supplier selection can occur before a new part is actually designed or reaches pro-
</p>
<p>duction. The team approach helps eliminate a source of frustration for supply manage-
ment&mdash;a lack of time to evaluate, select, and develop suppliers to support new-
product requirements. With the team approach, supplier selection can begin earlier
in the development process, which allows supply management to perform this critical
task earlier in the process and with better information.
</p>
<p>The following elements are important in considering new or existing suppliers for
integration:
</p>
<p>&bull; Targets. Is the supplier capable of hitting affordable targets regarding cost,
quality, conductivity, weight, and other performance criteria?
</p>
<p>&bull; Timing. Will the supplier be able to meet product introduction deadlines?
&bull; Ramp-up. Will the supplier be able to increase capacity and production fast
enough to meet our market share requirements?
</p>
<p>&bull; Innovation and technical. Does the supplier have the required engineering ex-
pertise and physical facilities to develop an adequate design, manufacture it,
and solve problems when they occur?
</p>
<p>&bull; Training. Do the supplier&rsquo;s key personnel have the required training to start
up required processes and debug them?
</p>
<p>&bull; Resource commitment. If the supplier is deficient in any of the above areas,
is management willing to commit resources to remedy the problem?
</p>
<p>4. Supplier Membership and Participation on the Team
Bringing suppliers into the product development process is different from simply
</p>
<p>sharing information, and it can involve including important suppliers early in the de-
sign process of a new product, perhaps even as part of the new-product team. The
benefits of early supplier involvement include gaining a supplier&rsquo;s insight into the de-
sign process, allowing comparisons of proposed production requirements against a
supplier&rsquo;s existing capabilities, and allowing a supplier to begin preproduction work
early. A supplier can bring a fresh perspective and new ideas to the development process.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If given the opportunity, suppliers can have a major impact on the overall timing
and success of a new product. The type of involvement can also vary (see Exhibit 4.6).
At one extreme, called white box design, the supplier is given blueprints and told to
make the product from them. At a more involved level, often called gray box design,
the supplier&rsquo;s engineers work cooperatively with the buying company&rsquo;s engineers to
jointly design the product. At the highest level of supplier involvement, black box
design, suppliers are provided with functional specifications and are asked to complete
all technical specifications, including materials to be used, blueprints, and so on.
Depending on the level of involvement, the supplier may need to be a full-time mem-
ber of the team, working alongside supply management, engineering, and manufactur-
ing to bring the project to fruition.

<p>suppliers. In most cases, no specific product or project was discussed at initial meet-
ings, only the potential for a meeting of the minds. The sharing of technology road-
maps often strongly influenced the type of buyer-supplier relationship that resulted
in the integration process. Very often, the buyer or supplier decided that this was not
a company they were interested in doing business with due to a diverging technology
roadmap. In cases when the supplier&rsquo;s current technology could be used but its long-
term technology roadmap diverged, companies often exploited the technology for the
current product or process but returned to the supply pool for future product cycles.
</p>
<p>Team participation allows supply management to evaluate the timing of each
phase of the product development project. Supply management can assess whether
project timing is realistic as it applies to a new part&rsquo;s sourcing requirements. If the tim-
ing is not realistic, supply management should have enough visibility to re-evaluate
the timing requirements or come up with plans to meet the proposed time frame. In
addition, an ongoing set of milestones should be established to ensure that communi-
cation with the supplier is ongoing and occurs at regular intervals. This can prevent
the occurrence of nasty surprises if the supplier falls behind schedule in completing
the project.
</p>
<p>Sourcing Snapshot: Suncor Energy Partners with Drilling Suppliers illustrates how
one company worked to closely integrate suppliers with its engineering and sourcing
teams, resulting in a competitive advantage in the industry.
</p>
<p>6. Co-Location of Buyer and Supplier Personnel
The physical co-location of a supplier engineer at a buying company is increas-
</p>
<p>ingly becoming a part of the normal product development process structure. One
company in the study operates what it calls a &ldquo;guest engineer&rdquo; program through
which it invites key suppliers to place an engineer in the buying company&rsquo;s facility
for a short period of time (two to three weeks) in the very early stages of product de-
velopment. During this period, the firms develop product and design specifications
and assign responsibilities for development. Another buying company co-locates its
personnel and the supplier&rsquo;s personnel at a neutral site due to union rules. The result
is the same: a focused and closely integrated team who work together throughout the
duration or just during critical stages of the development project. As discussed in
Sourcing Snapshot: Toyota Is Shut Down by a Supplier Problem, the importance of
being close to suppliers is particularly apparent during periods of supply chain
disruption.
</p>
<p>The NSF study suggested that certain types of suppliers are more likely to be inte-
grated earlier and may need to be physically co-located with the development team.
For instance, at a Japanese computer manufacturer, the extent of interaction that
takes place between product development engineers and suppliers appears to depend
on the volatility of the commodity technology. Suppliers of critical nonstandard com-
modities are involved much earlier in the product development initiative. These sup-
pliers are involved in face-to-face discussions with engineers on a regular basis. On
the other hand, suppliers of noncritical, standard items are not integrated until the fi-
nal stages of the development cycle, and communication appears to occur more in
the form of computerization (e.g., computer-aided design, or CAD, is used with non-
critical items such as PCBs, keyboards, and chassis). In general, face-to-face discus-
sions are quicker, and information can be exchanged more effectively. However, in
cases when suppliers are located within a day&rsquo;s travel of the operating divisions, co-
location is often unnecessary.

<p>7. Formal Business Unit Trust Development Efforts
A major responsibility of supply management is to provide information to suppli-
</p>
<p>ers involved in a new-product development project. Sharing of information can help
avoid unwelcome surprises throughout the life of a project, particularly if suppliers
are brought in early in the concept stage to design parts. If supply management se-
lects capable and trustworthy suppliers, it should be able to share product informa-
tion early in the development process. For example, if a component for a new part
requires a specific production process, it is important to make sure the supplier has
the required process capability. Early visibility to product requirements allows supply
management to share critical information with suppliers that can help avoid delays.
In turn, suppliers will be expected to share their information with the new-product de-
velopment team. To build this level of trust may require that parties sign appropriate
nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements prior to meeting. These types of agree-
ments are covered in Chapter 16.
</p>
<p>Sourcing
Snapshot
</p>
<p>Toyota Is Shut Down by
a Supplier Problem
</p>
<p>On July 19, 2007, financial markets worldwide learned of Toyota&rsquo;s production shutdown
in Japan, which was due entirely to the damage caused by the shutdown of one of its suppli-
ers, Tokyo-based Riken Corp. This supplier supplies engine parts to a host of global OEMs.
Toyota said it would cease production at all 12 of its domestic plants after a 6.8-magnitude
earthquake damaged the main production facilities of Riken Corp. Japan&rsquo;s No. 1 car maker
by sales had to stop production for at least three shifts. Despite applying lean inventory man-
agement practices, the plants had a supply of parts that kept them running during the first
few days after the quake hit.
</p>
<p>Most important of all, this one supply disruption impacted several other car makers, which
also said their production also was affected. Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Japan&rsquo;s No. 4 car
maker, said it suspended production for at least three days at three of its major assembly
plants. The company sent 40 of its engineers to the Riken plant to help get it up and run-
ning again. Suzuki Motor Corp. said it suffered from a production loss of about 10,000 cars
and 5,000 motorcycles because of a temporary shutdown at five domestic plants. Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd., which makes the Subaru brand of vehicles, also halted production at five
plants. Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co., which also depend on Riken for engine parts,
were impacted.
</p>
<p>The widespread impact highlights how auto companies are relying on a common parts
maker for a crucial part of their product. Riken is Japan&rsquo;s biggest maker of piston rings for
engines and of seal rings, which prevent leaks in transmissions. It provides parts for more
than half the cars built in Japan and about 20% of cars worldwide, according to the com-
pany, including vehicles from Ford Motor Co., BMW AG, and Volkswagen AG. A Volkswagen
spokesperson in Germany said the company&rsquo;s production hadn&rsquo;t been affected. A BMW spokes-
person couldn&rsquo;t say whether production would be affected. Ford couldn&rsquo;t be reached.
</p>
<p>Riken has plants in and around Kashiwazaki, the city most severely struck by the quake. The
earthquake killed nine and destroyed hundreds of homes.

<p>8. Sharing of Technology between Buyer and Supplier Companies
Supply management must work closely with engineering to determine whether
</p>
<p>there is a common convergence in technology strategies with the supplier. The most
common reference to this concept is a technology roadmap, which refers to the set of
performance criteria and products and processes an organization intends to develop
or manufacture. Many companies define their technology roadmaps in terms of the
next decade, whereas others employ a horizon of 50 years or even a century!
Although the exact form of a technology roadmap is somewhat industry specific, it
typically is defined in the following terms:
</p>
<p>&bull; Projected performance specifications for a class of products or processes
(e.g., memory size, speed, electrical resistance, temperature, or pressure)
</p>
<p>&bull; An intention to integrate a new material or component (e.g., a new form of
molecule or chemical)
</p>
<p>&bull; Development of a product to meet customer requirements that is currently
unavailable in the market (e.g., new television screen technology)
</p>
<p>&bull; Integration of multiple complementary technologies that results in a radical
new product (e.g., a combined fax/phone/modem/copier, or combining tele-
vision, cable, and computer technology)
</p>
<p>&bull; A combination of the above as well as other possible variations
</p>
<p>9. Joint Education and Training Efforts
Achieving this level of involvement, however, may prove difficult for personnel on
</p>
<p>both sides of the fence. Some of the typical concerns that arise in these scenarios in-
clude the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Unwillingness of internal design personnel to relinquish responsibility
&bull; Concerns over sharing proprietary information&mdash;both buyer and supplier
&bull; Lack of business processes to support integration
&bull; Lack of cultural alignment
</p>
<p>To overcome these problems, personnel at both the buyer and supplier may need to
be educated regarding the benefits of the integration effort, as well as be assured that
the proper confidentiality agreements have been completed. In addition, engineering
staff may require further education to ensure that they realize that they are not relin-
quishing their authority over design; another member is simply coming in to provide
additional insights that will lead to a better product and a more satisfied customer.
</p>
<p>Supplier Integration into Customer Order Fulfillment
Many companies are continuing to integrate suppliers not just in the product devel-
</p>
<p>opment phase, but also in the order fulfillment phase of the product life cycle. Suppli-
ers can provide significant benefits in the form of lower costs, improved delivery,
lower inventory, and problem-solving capabilities during the fulfillment stage of pro-
duction. Supplier integration takes place in various forms, including supplier sugges-
tion programs, buyer-seller improvement teams, and on-site supplier representatives.
</p>
<p>Supplier Suggestion Programs
Suppliers can be an invaluable source of ideas for process improvement. They
</p>
<p>bring with them a different expertise, a different point of view, and a greater volume

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>of ideas. Supply management groups are missing out on a great source of expertise
when they do not tap into suppliers&rsquo; suggestions. Suppliers may submit suggestions
through an Internet site, at a formal meeting, or during supplier conferences. Typi-
cally, a supplier will submit a proposal using a standard form that identifies the na-
ture of the improvement, impact areas, estimated savings, and business unit or
functional area of application. The suggestion is assigned a tracking number, to en-
sure that the idea is not lost in the cracks! The suggestion then goes through a for-
mal internal review, which may consist of multiple stages. The review team will use
the following criteria in assessing the suggestion:
</p>
<p>&bull; Feasibility
&bull; Resources required
&bull; Potential savings
&bull; Go/no-go decision
&bull; Feedback to supplier
</p>
<p>As a result of this review, the implementation team accepts or rejects the sugges-
tion. Accepted suggestions may go through further refinement, and the supplier may
be formally involved and given the go-ahead to proceed. Results from the suggestion
will then be tracked.
</p>
<p>Successful supplier suggestion programs tend to have several elements in common.
First, the savings from the suggestion are often shared 50/50, not kept solely by the
buying company. This encourages the supplier to provide further suggestions. Sec-
ond, the program focuses on cost improvement, not simply cutting the supplier&rsquo;s mar-
gins. Third, successful buying companies provide prompt feedback to the supplier on
its suggestion and also implement good suggestions promptly. This sends a clear mes-
sage that the supplier&rsquo;s idea is being taken seriously. It is important to do more than
just put the focus on suppliers&rsquo; problems. Other opportunities for improvement may
include those in the buying company, in intercompany communication and pro-
cesses, and even within second-tier suppliers. Finally, it is critical to acknowledge the
supplier&rsquo;s suggestion, through an awards program, newsletter, or announcement at a
supplier conference.
</p>
<p>Buyer-Seller Improvement Teams
More and more companies are involving suppliers on improvement teams in a va-
</p>
<p>riety of different areas. Why? Research reveals that teams that relied on supplier in-
put and involvement (when the task warranted involvement) were more effective in
their task, on average, than teams that did not involve suppliers.18 Teams that in-
clude suppliers as participants report positive outcomes and great supplier contribu-
tions across many performance areas, including the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Providing cost reduction ideas
&bull; Providing quality improvement ideas
&bull; Supporting actions to improve material delivery
&bull; Offering process technology suggestions
&bull; Supporting material-ordering cycle time reductions

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Also, teams that included suppliers as participants reported other important outcomes:
</p>
<p>&bull; Greater satisfaction concerning the quality of information exchange between
the team and key suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Higher reliance on suppliers to directly support the team&rsquo;s goals&mdash;the sup-
plier is a resource
</p>
<p>&bull; Fewer problems coordinating work activity between the team and key
suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Greater effort put forth on team assignment
</p>
<p>A manager at Honeywell described the advantages of working on a buyer-seller im-
provement team when it came time to quickly identify and solve a quality problem
with a major customer.19 He noted: &ldquo;Customers came to us with a product quality
problem, and eventually we traced it back to the supplier. We had problems with the
supplier&rsquo;s product, and we identified the problem as occurring because their process
had shifted. Initially, we went to process quality assurance with the problem and con-
fronted them. At first, the supplier refused to believe that it was their fault, and
claimed that we were not using the material correctly. Our group leader for the prod-
uct team found it difficult to coordinate with the supplier and therefore requested an
in-house person from their facility to work with us. The problem was resolved
through many teleconferences, meetings at their facility, checking their processes, sup-
plier teams coming to our plant, and many exchanges on specifications via e-mail,
fax, etc. They identified the problem in their process, and since then they are perform-
ing very well. There was clearly a learning phase in transitioning from a traditional re-
lationship, but resolving this problem clearly showed how to work together to
strengthen our relationship.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>On-Site Supplier Representative
Many companies are encouraging suppliers to provide a permanent on-site repre-
</p>
<p>sentative who can aid the company in improving customer order fulfillment pro-
cesses. The idea behind this initiative (called vendor-managed inventory in some circles)
is to have the representative assist in managing the inventory of materials or services,
provide technical support, and in some cases even aid in assembling and producing
the product or service! On-site suppliers are established when the purchaser empow-
ers a supplier representative to work on-site to perform various tasks. The supplier as-
sumes administrative costs and assigns a full-time or part-time representative to be
physically co-located on-site.
</p>
<p>There are a number of purchase categories where an on-site supplier representa-
tive can be used, including the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Waste management
&bull; Printing services
&bull; Spare parts inventory and other MRO items
&bull; Computer equipment and software
&bull; Office furniture
&bull; Uniforms and protective equipment

<p>&bull; Process control equipment
&bull; Production parts
&bull; Transportation services
&bull; Production maintenance
</p>
<p>On-site representatives can be used in a number of functional areas as well.
</p>
<p>Supply Management
An on-site supplier representative can process purchase transactions between cus-
</p>
<p>tomer and supplier using the customer&rsquo;s supply management system and purchase or-
ders. In addition, the on-site rep can work cooperatively with the customer&rsquo;s planner
to ensure timely and efficient delivery of materials. In some cases, the on-site represen-
tative can also assume a buyer-planner role and coordinate multiple facilities. It
should be noted that the on-site rep places orders only at the established price and
only with the supplier company involved.
</p>
<p>Sales
An on-site supplier rep may perform the routine responsibilities of a traditional
</p>
<p>sales representative. The supplier is empowered to sell directly to internal units from
an on-site location. This can often result in a reduction in the supplier&rsquo;s overhead
cost structure for this particular customer, because a good portion of overhead goes
to budgeting for a sales force.
</p>
<p>Engineering
Preferred suppliers can reside on-site and are empowered to provide design sup-
</p>
<p>port under the supervision of customer engineers. These full-time, on-site supplier re-
presentatives act as resident information resources. The customer can thus utilize
supplier ideas and expertise at the earliest stages of product and process development.
</p>
<p>Transportation
Overseas transportation modes (surface, air, ocean, foreign brokerage) may be com-
</p>
<p>bined into one location controlled at the customer&rsquo;s site. Suppliers of freight services
provide professional on-site support to the using location and can create a command
center for coordination of all inbound and outbound transportation within the sup-
ply chain.
</p>
<p>Potential Benefits of On-Site Supplier Representatives
A number of benefits can occur for both parties in a supplier representative situa-
</p>
<p>tion. These are also summarized in the form of a win-win proposition shown in Ex-
hibit 4.7.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer-supplier coordination and integration are increased.
&bull; Supplier personnel work on-site to support the purchaser.
&bull; Supply management staff are increased.
&bull; Supplier in-plant personnel perform various buying and planning activities,
allowing supply management staff to pursue other value-added activities.

</p>
<p>Caterpillar Works with
Delco to Achieve Mutually
Beneficial Outcomes
</p>
<p>Over the last decade, Caterpillar Inc. has worked closely with Delco Electronics (now known
as Delphi) to create a highly integrated relationship. It first approached Delco Electronics in 1997
with the opportunity to compete for the strategic position as its electronics supplier. Two factors
were driving this opportunity. The first was that Caterpillar was dissatisfied with its current sup-
plier. The second was that it wanted to reduce its in-house electronics capability to allow it to fo-
cus more on its core business. In the case of Caterpillar, the buyer has had two distinct roles.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As a participant in the strategic supplier selection, the buyer was involved in an extensive pro-
cess to evaluate suppliers and ultimately recommend to senior management a supplier to
assume the role of strategic supplier. This process lasted six to eight months. It involved nu-
merous visits by the team to Delco Electronics&rsquo; headquarters, engineering facilities, and
manufacturing facilities. It included quoting several different scenarios ranging from build-
to-print to design-and-build. Quoting was a benchmarking exercise to understand capability
and not an exercise to set pricing. The evaluation included several Delco Electronics visits to
meet with Caterpillar&rsquo;s engineering groups and present its execution, quality, and cost reduc-
tion plans in the event of being selected. It included several rounds of discussions.
</p>
<p>Delco Electronics received word through the buyer that it had been selected to be the strate-
gic supplier of electronics to Caterpillar. It was at this point that the buyer&rsquo;s role switched to
that of executor of the strategy. At this point, Delco Electronics had not yet been awarded
any business. Shortly after the announcement, the buyer presented a preliminary draft of an
agreement that started something like this: &ldquo;Delco Electronics has agreed to supply Cater-
pillar 100% of its electronics requirements for the next five years. . . . &rdquo; He also restated the
strategy outlined during the selection process. This consisted of Delco Electronics starting im-
mediately to supply existing products on a build-to-print basis and evolving to a design-and-
build basis. He also explained the Caterpillar business model for pricing.
</p>
<p>From that point forward, the buyer&rsquo;s role was to ensure successful execution of the strategy.
The buyer spent his time ensuring that the two companies were developing the right working
relationship. He had weekly meetings with all team members, ensured that deliverables were
met, and escalated issues in both Delco Electronics and Caterpillar. He and other Caterpillar
participants attended prototype builds at the Delco Electronics manufacturing site. When new
programs were identified, he would attend the Sanctioning Body Approval event, the first for-
mal gate in the Delco Electronics Product Development Process. His attendance was focused
on ensuring that Delco Electronics was ready to start the development of the new program.
Did it have resources in place? Did it understand the technical requirements? Was it linked
up with the correct Caterpillar technical resources? Early in the relationship the team estab-
lished a regular cadence of management meetings. The buyer always attended and assumed
the prime Caterpillar lead role. On pricing there was no competitive bidding. There were dis-
cussions pertaining to volume and recovery of engineering content.
</p>
<p>Much of this activity continues today at a much higher level of maturity as both companies
have nourished the relationship. Throughout, Caterpillar never lost any sleep over the success
of Delco Electronics as a supplier. The buyer clearly felt responsibility for the outcome. There
was no hand-off to others in the organization or to other organizations. Today, Delphi is in-
volved in more than 20 electronics programs with Caterpillar worth millions of dollars. As the
business has grown, the buyer&rsquo;s office has expanded to include a senior buyer, two buyers,
and a person involved in quality and readiness issues. Although there have been changes in
personnel over the years, clarity of ownership has not changed 10 years later!
</p>
<p>Questions
1. Review Caterpillar&rsquo;s process for early supplier involvement. What was critical to the suc-
</p>
<p>cess of the relationship?
</p>
<p>2. How important was the role of specific individuals involved in the discussion? What does
this say about the importance of trust in managing buyer-supplier relationships in such
an environment, and the role of individuals in the relationship?
</p>
<p>3. How were the risks minimized? Do you believe the benefits in this case outweighed these po-
tential risks?

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CONCLUSION
This chapter discussed the need for supply management to develop closer rela-
</p>
<p>tions with internal and external groups. To accomplish this, supply management pro-
fessionals must develop a working knowledge of the principles of engineering,
manufacturing, cost-based accounting, quality assurance, and team dynamics. The
days are over when supply management could operate in a confined area with only
an occasional visit to a supplier.
</p>
<p>Firms are using the team approach to streamline and improve the product develop-
ment process. This directly affects firms that rely on innovative new products for
their continued success. Supply management has a key role to play on these teams.
In its role, supply management helps select suppliers for inclusion in the process, ad-
vises engineering personnel of suppliers&rsquo; capabilities, and helps negotiate contracts
once the product team has selected a supplier. Supply management also acts as a liai-
son throughout this process, in facilitating supplier participation at team meetings
and helping to resolve conflicts between the supplier and the team when they occur.
Supply management may also be involved in developing a target price for the sup-
plier to aim at while planning the component or system, and helping the supplier to
analyze costs and identify ways of meeting this target price. Finally, supply manage-
ment may also be involved in developing nondisclosure and confidentiality agree-
ments in cases where technology sharing occurs.
</p>
<p>Part of the increased interaction between supply management and other functions
is due to the need to compete in an environment driven by reduced product cycle
times. Supply management supports this effort by developing closer internal and ex-
ternal relationships and by participating on cross-functional teams. Those interested
in the supply management profession should learn as much as they can about what
it takes to compete in today&rsquo;s markets, including expanding their knowledge about
the team approach as well as understanding how firms compete on cost, quality, and
time. The need to interact effectively with different groups plays a major role in how
well supply management can accomplish its tasks.

<p>Harley-Davidson Creates a High-Powered Purchasing
Organization
</p>
<p>Harley-Davidson, a pre-eminent maker of heavy motorcycles, learned the hard way
about the need for a high-powered purchasing organization. Faced with declining sales, poor
quality, and once-loyal customers switching to Japanese motorcycles, managers at this once-
proud company knew they had to reinvent how they did business if they expected to rejuve-
nate the Harley-Davidson brand. Creating the right supply organization became a central fea-
ture of this reinvention. The results today speak for themselves. The saying at the company
is that it &ldquo;began as the motor company, it became a family&rdquo; by realizing that every member
of the family has a stake in the company&rsquo;s success. The financial results indicate the com-
pany&rsquo;s philosophy is working. In 2006 total revenue grew by 8.6% to $5.8 billion. Net income
also rose to $1.04 billion, an increase of 8.7%. Part of this success is due to the successful
re-engineering of the purchasing function.
</p>
<p>For many years, Harley-Davidson maintained a traditional approach to purchasing. The com-
pany haphazardly selected suppliers and evaluated purchase costs, kept suppliers at a dis-
tance, and positioned purchasing as a lower-level function where engineers made crucial
buying decisions. This approach mirrored the company&rsquo;s financial performance, which de-
clined to the point that its very survival was in question.
</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Harley-Davidson is nothing like the Harley of the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Quality
is strong, new products are introduced on a regular basis, demand is outpacing supply, and
customer loyalty has never been higher. And at the center of this resurgence is a purchasing
organization that has become the benchmark for others to study.
</p>
<p>While Harley-Davidson has taken many steps to restore its luster, some of the more impor-
tant changes center on creating the right purchasing organization. One of the company&rsquo;s
more important changes involved creating a higher-level position to lead the charge in sup-
ply management. A new vice president of materials and product costs brought a vision to
help articulate company objectives through materials management strategies, elevate the visi-
bility of the purchasing organization, encourage suppliers to work directly with Harley, and
help the company adopt a unique Internet-based strategy to make communication with suppli-
ers more efficient.
</p>
<p>The new vice president wasted no time in creating an on-site residency program for suppli-
ers to participate in during the development of new products. Fifty full-time resident (i.e.,
on-site) suppliers and 80 part-time residents take part in new-product design. Suppliers par-
ticipate in design meetings to help Harley-Davidson&rsquo;s engineering teams improve quality
while reducing costs. This interaction takes place at the company&rsquo;s Product Development Cen-
ter in Milwaukee and brings together design, engineering, manufacturing, and suppliers in
an atmosphere that promotes supply chain collaboration.
</p>
<p>The vice president also recognized the importance of having purchasing personnel work di-
rectly with engineers. He created the position of purchasing engineer, which requires a combi-
nation of commercial and technical knowledge and skills. Purchasing engineers support
product design and manufacturing teams and have responsibility for integrating suppliers
into Harley-Davidson&rsquo;s processes. Purchasing professionals are also co-located with en-
gineers so purchasing can work side-by-side with engineering, providing that group with a
better feel for cost issues at the early stages of product design. Purchasing brings knowl-
edge of sourcing, alternative materials, and information on new technology. Because of pur-
chasing&rsquo;s involvement, engineering, a group that traditionally did not consider costs a top
priority, now considers costs more closely when designing new products.

<p>154 Part 2 Purchasing Operations and Structure</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When considering the many ways to create competitive advantage through supply
management efforts, we often hear about exciting initiatives involving information
technology, outsourcing, cost management techniques, or strategic relationships.
Rarely discussed, however, is how the more mundane topic of organizational design
can promote or impede the attainment of procurement and supply objectives. Except
perhaps for cross-functional teaming, organizational design does not receive much at-
tention within supply management.
</p>
<p>Organizational design refers to the process of assessing and selecting the structure
and formal system of communication, division of labor, coordination, control, author-
ity, and responsibility required to achieve organizational goals and objectives, includ-
ing supply management objectives. Although charts may illustrate the formal design
of an organization, they present an incomplete picture. The design of an organization
is much more than a series of lines and boxes on an organizational chart.1
</p>
<p>Another part of Harley-Davidson&rsquo;s organizational design is the company&rsquo;s Supplier Advisory
Council. This council, which meets on a regular basis, features executive-to-executive interac-
tion between Harley-Davidson and a rotating group of critical suppliers. In general, these
councils share product development plans and supply chain information, create joint mea-
sures of success, create a co-destiny and trust between members, and work to align long-
range goals and technology development.
</p>
<p>The purchasing organization is structured in a center-led philosophy with four major catego-
ries. The categories are listed below, and one can see there are differences in the focus that
individual suppliers need to address to be successful in selling to Harley-Davidson:
</p>
<p>1. General Merchandise&mdash;Much of the focus and energy is spent in the area of new-
product development due to the shorter product life cycles.
</p>
<p>2. Maintenance, Repair, and Operating (MRO)&mdash;Suppliers are critical to the success
of Harley-Davidson in that the products and services they provide ensure contin-
ual production and acquisition of quality products.
</p>
<p>3. Original Equipment&mdash;A supplier&rsquo;s initial involvement with Harley-Davidson is
likely to be with a purchasing engineer from the Product Development Centers. Pur-
chasing leads a cross-functional group of stakeholders in the supplier selection
process.
</p>
<p>4. Parts and Accessories&mdash;Because of their shorter life cycles, much of the focus
and energy of this group is spent in the area of new-product development. Suppli-
ers must recognize that due to this shorter product life cycle, much emphasis is
placed upon a shorter product development cycle. Failure to address this require-
ment can lead to a missed opportunity in the market. Service parts usually have
longer life cycles than accessories.
</p>
<p>Over the last several years, income has grown faster than sales, and purchased costs have
shrunk by $37 million. This compares with the $40 million increase that would have occurred
if purchasing had continued to let costs increase at the historical level of 1.5 to 2%. And,
most suppliers now supply materials on a just-in-time basis, further reducing inventory-carry-
ing costs. So, has Harley-Davidson&rsquo;s purchasing organization helped the company? You be
the judge!

<p>An effective (or ineffective) organizational design affects the success of purchasing
and inevitably the entire organization. This chapter explores purchasing within the
context of a formal organization, which requires the presentation of certain topics:
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchasing&rsquo;s position within the organizational structure
&bull; Organizing the purchasing function
&bull; Placement of purchasing authority
&bull; Organizing for supply chain management
&bull; Using teams as part of the organizational structure
&bull; Creating the organization of the future
</p>
<p>Purchasing&rsquo;s Position within the Organizational
Structure
</p>
<p>A formal organizational structure serves several purposes. First, it shows the assign-
ment of work along with the authority that accompanies those responsibilities. Sec-
ond, a formal structure helps define how a firm communicates and integrates
decision making across the groups comprising the organization (a process also re-
ferred to as coordination).2
</p>
<p>Our concern here is with the physical position or placement of purchasing in the
organizational hierarchy or reporting structure. Why is purchasing&rsquo;s position or place-
ment in an organizational structure important? Basically, the physical placement and
reporting relationship of a function usually indicate its organizational status and influ-
ence. A function whose highest responsible executive is a manager (or even several
managers) lacks the organizational importance of a function whose highest responsi-
ble executive is a senior vice president. In some organizations, the highest purchasing
professional&rsquo;s reporting status is on a par with other major functions. In others, we
have to search before finding an individual executive responsible for purchasing. The
trends shown in recent research support the fact that purchasing is gaining more visi-
bility in the corporate hierarchy. The results of a study covering 16 years indicated
that in both manufacturing and services, chief purchasing officers (CPOs) have
greater responsibilities, report higher in the organization, and carry more significant
titles than their predecessors.3 This section presents some of the factors influencing
purchasing&rsquo;s position or placement in the formal organizational structure.
</p>
<p>Factors Affecting Purchasing&rsquo;s Position in the
Organizational Hierarchy
</p>
<p>History
Perhaps the most important factor contributing to purchasing&rsquo;s position in the or-
</p>
<p>ganizational hierarchy is history. For established organizations, early purchasing his-
tory emphasized the gradual development of the policies and procedures defining
proper purchasing from an operational perspective. For many years, many viewed an
assignment in purchasing as a career with few prospects for promotion or increased
decision making. In recent years, however, this trend has been reversing. Purchasing
is slowly but surely receiving greater attention from executive management.

<p>Type of Industry
Some industries are not as driven by materials or external technological change as
</p>
<p>others. The need to constantly innovate and improve often places materials-related ac-
tivities at a higher level compared with mature industries or those with a history of
treating purchasing as a lower-level function. In rapidly changing industries or those
where purchased goods and services comprise a larger portion of product or service
costs, management usually recognizes the need to place purchasing in a higher posi-
tion within the organizational hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Total Value of Goods and Services
Companies such as John Deere, Honda, and DaimlerChrysler spend 60 to 70% of
</p>
<p>their sales dollars on purchased goods and services. In the computer and tele-
communications industries, companies such as Nortel Networks, Solectron, IBM,
Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun rely on suppliers for parts as well as new technol-
ogy&mdash;which means that purchasing plays a critical role. A service organization spend-
ing 10 to 20% of its sales dollar for purchased goods and services will, on average,
view purchasing differently compared with a firm spending over 60%.
</p>
<p>Other Factors
The philosophy of the founder (particularly when the founder still plays an active
</p>
<p>role) exerts a strong influence on an organization&rsquo;s formal design. This is especially
true in high-technology organizations started during the last 25 years. If the founder
is marketing oriented, the firm usually has a strong marketing perspective. If the
founder is engineering oriented, the emphasis is usually on product and process devel-
opment. The founder of Herman Miller Inc., a producer of industrial office furniture,
believed that organizations should be the &ldquo;stewards&rdquo; of the environment. Conse-
quently, purchasing plays a strong role at that company in emphasizing environmen-
tal responsibility.
</p>
<p>The type of purchased materials affects organizational position. The purchase of
routine items is quite different from the purchase of leading-edge high technology.
Purchasing departments confronted with fast-paced change usually have closer con-
tact with other functional groups and a higher organizational reporting level.
</p>
<p>The ability to influence a company&rsquo;s performance is another factor affecting pur-
chasing&rsquo;s position. When purchasing can strongly affect competitiveness, purchasing
assumes a higher position in the organizational structure. The ability to influence per-
formance is such a critical factor that it often overrides any other factor that previ-
ously supported a lower purchasing profile.
</p>
<p>To Whom Does Purchasing Report?
A clear trend during the last 25 years is that the level of executive to whom pur-
</p>
<p>chasing reports has increased. Bloom and Nardone reported that &ldquo;during the 1950s
and early 1960s, a high percentage of the purchasing departments reported in a
second-level capacity to the functional managers, most commonly production and
operations.&rdquo;4
</p>
<p>A study by the Center for Advanced Purchasing Studies (CAPS) revealed a change
in the reporting level of purchasing during the 1980s.5 The study found that in al-
most 35% of the organizations surveyed, the highest purchasing executive reported to
a senior or group vice president or higher. The percentage of CPOs reporting to a

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>top-five executive position category has continued to increase. One research study in-
dicated that in 2003, 70% of the responding CPOs reported to a top-five executive,
up from 61% in 1995 and 44% in 1987.6 Another study indicated this was higher in
smaller firms, which, because of their simplified structures, tend to have their highest
purchasing or supply manager report to higher organizational levels. Purchasing re-
ports to the highest executive or one level from the highest executive in almost 90%
of smaller firms. Purchasing reports to the highest executive or one level from the
highest executive in almost 65% of medium and large firms (based on sales).7
</p>
<p>Exhibit 5.1 illustrates three possible placements of purchasing in the organiza-
tional hierarchy. In (a), purchasing is an upper-level function reporting directly to
the executive vice president. In (b), purchasing is a mid-level function reporting to
an executive one level below the executive vice president, which is a common report-
ing level today. In (c), purchasing reports at least two reporting levels from the execu-
tive vice president.
</p>
<p>Is the reporting level of purchasing important? One research study found that hav-
ing a higher-level procurement officer who makes regular presentations to the presi-
dent or chief executive officer (CEO) is the design feature that correlates highest with
the achievement of procurement and supply objectives.8 In general, the higher that
purchasing is in the corporate structure, the greater the role it plays in supporting or-
ganizational objectives.
</p>
<p>Organizing the Purchasing Function
Each functional group, and even department, has its own organizational structure.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 5.2 on p. 160, for example, presents the organizational structure for a high-
tech company&rsquo;s sourcing office in China. With this chart, we begin to see the divi-
sion of duties and the formal reporting structure among the participants. This sec-
tion discusses the organization of the functional activity called purchasing into
specialized subgroups.
</p>
<p>Specialization within Purchasing
Purchasing departments in larger organizations usually structure themselves to sup-
</p>
<p>port specialized purchasing activities, which are grouped into four major areas: (1)
sourcing and negotiating; (2) purchasing research; (3) operational support and order
follow-up; and (4) administration and support. It is not efficient or practical to have
all purchasing personnel responsible for every task located within each group. In-
stead, most purchasing departments organize into specialized subgroups.
</p>
<p>Sourcing and Negotiating
This group identifies potential suppliers, negotiates with selected suppliers, and per-
</p>
<p>forms the buying of goods and services. Buyers are usually responsible for a specific
range or type of item(s), which may be grouped into commodities or services catego-
ries. For example, plastic injected parts are an example of a purchase commodity.
Trash removal and security are examples of services. Other buyers may specialize in
raw materials and are responsible for steel, copper, packaging supplies, and so on. Re-
gardless of the commodity or service, higher-dollar items will involve extensive nego-
tiations with suppliers. Very often, buyers will work in teams that have responsibility
for negotiating contracts for the entire organization.

<p>Purchasing Research
Purchasing research involves developing long-range materials forecasts, conduct-
</p>
<p>ing value analysis programs, assessing supplier capabilities, and analyzing the cost
structure of suppliers. Although some of these specialized tasks are the responsibility
of individual buyers, more and more organizations recognize the benefit of having spe-
cialized research personnel. The development of product and material plans requires
detailed and accurate research.
</p>
<p>Operational Support and Order Follow-Up
This group includes the activities supporting the day-to-day operations of the pur-
</p>
<p>chasing or materials function. Order expediters and follow-up personnel are part of
this group. The preparation and transfer of material releases to suppliers is also part
of the operational support process. Many of the tasks that qualify as operational sup-
port are being streamlined or automated, especially with the advent of business-to-
business (B2B) e-commerce technologies. As a result, the number of purchasing per-
sonnel committed to these types of tasks is declining. Because operational support
activities represent a poor use of a buyer&rsquo;s time, organizations are increasingly

<p>developing two categories of purchasers: strategically oriented and tactical. Strategi-
cally oriented buyers focus on the company and industry future by managing total
cost, enhancing value, and minimizing risks, whereas tactical buyers focus more on
the day-to-day challenges required to meet the organization&rsquo;s current needs.9
</p>
<p>Administration and Support
This group is responsible for developing the policies and procedures that purchas-
</p>
<p>ing personnel follow, administering and maintaining the purchasing information sys-
tem and database, determining required staffing levels, developing department plans,
organizing training and seminars for buyers, and developing measurement systems to
evaluate purchasing performance. This group concerns itself with making sure the
purchasing department runs smoothly and meets its targeted goals within budget,
and fulfills its responsibilities to both internal and external customers.
</p>
<p>Purchasing Department Activities
Today&rsquo;s purchasing department does much more than the traditional buying of
</p>
<p>materials, parts, and services. The role of purchasing is expanding to reflect the grow-
ing importance of purchasing and the performance contribution of suppliers. The fol-
lowing responsibilities are commonly performed tasks performed by a modern
purchasing group. Not all departments perform every one of these tasks. The trend,
however, is for more of these assignments to become purchasing&rsquo;s responsibility.
</p>
<p>Buying
By definition, a primary responsibility of the purchasing function involves buying&mdash;
</p>
<p>a broad term describing the purchase of raw materials, components, finished goods,
or services from suppliers, some of whom can be another operating unit within the orga-
nization. The purchase can be a one-time requirement or the release for materials
against an established purchase order. The buying process requires supplier evaluation,
negotiation, and selection.
</p>
<p>Expediting
Expediting is the process of personally or electronically contacting suppliers to de-
</p>
<p>termine the status of past-due or near-past-due shipments. In smaller organizations,
expediting is often part of the purchasing function. In larger organizations, expediters
often report to a separate materials control department. The actual expediting pro-
cess rarely provides new value within the purchasing process. Unfortunately, ex-
pediters are an accepted overhead cost at some organizations.
</p>
<p>Progressive organizations recognize that a need for expediters indicates that suppli-
ers are not performing as required or that suppliers are not receiving realistic or sta-
ble material release schedules. It is also possible that the buying organization is
making frequent and demanding schedule changes. To prevent this situation, more
companies are reducing their use of expediting by developing realistic material re-
lease schedules and doing business with suppliers capable of meeting material ship-
ment schedules.
</p>
<p>Increasingly, purchasing is becoming less involved with expediting and inventory
control. The increased sophistication and usability of enterprise systems such as ERP
allow many of the traditional expediting and inventory-control decisions to be put
into the hands of users. Chapter 18 provides in-depth coverage of ERP systems.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Inventory Control
The inventory control function monitors the day-to-day management of pur-
</p>
<p>chased and in-process inventory at each using location. This activity often relies on so-
phisticated equations or algorithms to facilitate balancing the product or service
demand requirements with the required purchase inputs for each location. In many
larger companies, the individual responsible for sourcing an item is often not responsi-
ble for the maintenance or routine release of purchase requirements.
</p>
<p>Transportation
The U.S. government deregulated transportation services in the early 1980s. Since
</p>
<p>that time, purchasing has taken an active role in the evaluation, negotiation, and final
selection of transportation services and carriers. Transportation is a highly specialized
activity with its own set of requirements. Chapter 17 discusses the purchase of trans-
portation services.
</p>
<p>Managing Countertrade Arrangements
Purchasing may have responsibility for managing countertrade&mdash;international or
</p>
<p>domestic trade where goods are exchanged for goods as payment&mdash;although at some
companies it is a specialized activity separate from purchasing. Because countertrade
involves the purchase of foreign goods, purchasing may involve itself with this special-
ized form of international trade. Chapter 10 discusses countertrade.
</p>
<p>Insourcing/Outsourcing
Purchasing often analyzes whether a new or existing purchase requirement should
</p>
<p>be internally or externally sourced. Certain items or services, such as standard or rou-
tine items, do not require insourcing/outsourcing evaluations. For other items, how-
ever, the analysis takes on strategic importance involving more than simple cost
comparisons. Purchasing&rsquo;s role in make-or-buy analyses is an important one. Regard-
ing outsourcing, purchasing must identify whether qualified suppliers exist in the
marketplace. Further requirements may include supplier visits, negotiation, and moni-
toring supplier performance.
</p>
<p>Value Analysis
Value analysis, a continuous improvement methodology developed by Larry Miles
</p>
<p>at General Electric during the late 1940s, is the organized study of an item&rsquo;s function
as it relates to value and cost. Value represents the relationship between function and
cost. The objective of value analysis is to enhance value by reducing the cost of a
good or service without sacrificing quality, enhancing functionality without increas-
ing cost, or providing greater functionality to the user above and beyond any in-
crease in cost. Purchasing actively involves itself with value analysis through the
study of materials, specifications, and suppliers. Chapter 12 discusses this methodol-
ogy further.
</p>
<p>Purchasing Research/Materials Forecasting
Purchasing often has responsibility for anticipating short- and long-term changes
</p>
<p>in material and supply markets. Research and forecasting are critical for any organiza-
tion that sources raw materials or components. Detailed short- and long-term pur-
chasing plans are required for items subject to technological, economic, or political

<p>change. These plans should include the historical and projected future usage of the
purchased item, purchase objectives, assessment of the supply market, cost/price anal-
ysis, supplier evaluation, and the recommended procurement strategy.
</p>
<p>Supply Management
As discussed in the first chapter, supply management is a progressive approach to
</p>
<p>managing the supply base that differs from a traditional arm&rsquo;s-length or adversarial
approach with sellers. It requires purchasing professionals to work directly with those
suppliers that are capable of providing superior performance to the buyer.
</p>
<p>Supply management involves purchasing, engineering, supplier quality assurance,
the supplier, and other related functions working together to further mutual goals. In-
stead of adversarial relationships, supply management features closer relationships
with specially selected suppliers. It involves frequent help to suppliers in exchange
for dramatic and continuous performance improvements, including steady price
reductions.
</p>
<p>Other Responsibilities
Purchasing can also assume a variety of other responsibilities such as receiving
</p>
<p>and warehousing, managing company travel arrangements, production planning and
control, commodity futures trading, global transportation and materials management,
economic forecasting, and subcontracting.
</p>
<p>Separating Strategic and Operational Purchasing
Managing day-to-day operations is quite different from managing longer-term re-
</p>
<p>sponsibilities. Can the personnel who must manage the uninterrupted flow of materi-
als also find time to practice strategic supply management? Do these personnel even
have the right skills to shift from operational to strategic purchasing? When pressed
for time, strategic responsibilities take second place to the immediate needs presented
by operational issues. Strategic responsibilities lack the immediacy of tactical duties
and, as a result, are often ignored.
</p>
<p>One way to ensure that both types of assignments receive adequate attention is to
separate the staff according to tactical and strategic job assignments. Separation does
not mean one group or area is more important than another. Both types of assign-
ments are important and require specialized attention. Often the group responsible
for strategic activities is part of a centrally led sourcing group at a headquarters or re-
gional location. The operational purchasing group is often located at buying centers,
sites, or plants.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 5.3 on p. 164 highlights the characteristics of tactical and strategic buying.
Both positions require buyers to work closely with internal groups while displaying
the ability to think creatively. The skills required for a strategic focus, however, will
be different from the skills required for an operational focus. The separation of profes-
sional duties will become increasingly common as a means to satisfy operational and
strategic performance objectives. Larger firms, compared with smaller and medium-
size firms, rate the formal separation of strategic and tactical responsibilities, person-
nel, positions, and structure quite highly as an expected design feature over the next
five years.10

<p>Placement of Purchasing Authority
Placement of purchasing authority refers to where an organization locates its deci-
</p>
<p>sion-making authority. If a supply executive at corporate headquarters has the author-
ity for the majority of the organization&rsquo;s purchase expenditures, then a firm
maintains a centralized authority structure. If purchasing authority for the majority of
purchase expenditures is at the divisional, business unit, or site level, then a firm has
a more decentralized decision-making authority.
</p>
<p>We can envision different purchasing organizations in terms of authority as exist-
ing on a continuum, with complete centralization at one end and complete decentrali-
zation at the other. Few organizations lie at these polar extremes; rather, most
organizations lie somewhere toward one end or the other. Certain decisions or tasks,
such as the evaluation and selection of suppliers that will support an entire organiza-
tion, may be centrally led. The actual generation of individual purchase orders or con-
tract releases can be located with local buyers. Different items may be subject to
different authority levels. For example, a firm might centralize the authority for capi-
tal expenditure purchases over a specified dollar amount while lower-dollar decisions
are made at a facility level.
</p>
<p>The one thing that is certain regarding organizational structure is that it will
change. The 1970s and 1980s&rsquo; version of centralized purchasing authority often re-
sulted in complete purchasing control, along with a large staff, placed at the corpo-
rate level. This additional layer of decision making quickly became unresponsive to
the fast-paced needs of global competitors, leading to a push for more decentralized
purchasing structures. Moreover, bloated organizational charts represented a major

<p>barrier to a flexible and responsive approach to supply chain management. The im-
pact of mergers, consolidations, and downsizing coupled with global competition and
increased information systems visibility pushed organizations to a more centralized
stance in the 1990s. Today&rsquo;s version of centralized or centrally led purchasing should
emphasize support, integration, and coordination of different tasks that are common
across a business rather than strict control over all the activities within the purchas-
ing process. The challenge today is to know which activities, processes, and tasks to
control or coordinate centrally and which to assign to operating units. This type of
organizational structure, which combines a centralized approach for purchased items
common to several business units and a decentralized approach to unique require-
ments, is termed hybrid. A recent study indicated that the hybrid structure was the
most used among large firms (54% using) and that it would remain the most popular
until 2010 (44% forecasted using) but would lose some popularity to more central-
ized organizations (42% forecasted using).11 Tyco&rsquo;s experience in the Sourcing Snap-
shot: Tyco Customizes Its Sourcing Organization to Fit Business Needs provides a
good example of developing a centrally led structure in a large conglomerate.
</p>

</p>
<p>Tyco Customizes Its
Sourcing Organization
to Fit Business Needs
</p>
<p>The structure of many global sourcing organizations starts at the top and moves down-
ward through an organizational chart. Although this traditional model works well for compa-
nies with one business, it can be somewhat limiting to diversified companies with multiple
business units. And worse, it fails to capitalize on the individual strengths that each divi-
sion or business unit can bring to the table.
</p>
<p>Tyco International, of Princeton, NJ, has developed a custom-designed procurement organiza-
tional strategy that gives its individual business units the flexibility they need while centraliz-
ing certain functions or aspects when that makes sense.
</p>
<p>Tyco is a large conglomerate that has been developed through numerous corporate acquisi-
tions. &ldquo;There was a time when Tyco was acquiring four to five companies a week, but it
wasn&rsquo;t devoting a lot of resources to integrating those companies,&rdquo; says Russ Davis, senior
director of corporate sourcing at Tyco. Because of that, clearly integrating all these seg-
ments and divisions became a challenge. When Davis and Shelley Stewart, senior vice presi-
dent of operational excellence and CPO, joined Tyco four years ago, there was no real
corporate sourcing organization in place&mdash;each of the very diverse business segments did
its own sourcing.
</p>
<p>When Stewart and Davis began to set up a number of sourcing initiatives, though, the differ-
ences between Tyco&rsquo;s many business units and companies began to show themselves. One
difference that became clear was that some of Tyco&rsquo;s companies had well-integrated sourc-
ing teams, whereas others did not. In addition, each company had a number of divisions,
some of which had multiple locations. This meant that getting to the actual stakeholders
was a challenge. For these reasons, running center-led corporatewide initiatives became very
challenging.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We realized what we really needed to do first was to create a team that could work in this en-
vironment, so that we could begin to leverage our spend,&rdquo; Davis explains. This led to looking
at the concepts of visibility, stakeholder mapping, and team development.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Factors Influencing Centralized/Centrally Led
or Decentralized Structures
</p>
<p>The correlation between purchase dollar expenditures and purchasing staff size var-
ies widely according to (1) the type of company; (2) the nature or complexity of the prod-
uct or service produced; (3) the physical number of items that must be purchased; and
(4) the scope of the purchasing responsibility, including involvement in activities such
as strategic sourcing and market research and analysis, and the extent of involvement in
services. The corporate purchasing group is headed by a chief purchasing officer, who re-
ports directly to a top executive. In multifacility organizations the purchasing manager
reports directly to an executive at the facility and often has a dotted-line connection to
a corporate CPO. Thus, in larger corporations with multiple locations there are local pur-
chasing personnel plus a corporate purchasing department. In more centralized purchas-
ing organizations, the corporate purchasing department may commit a majority of the
spend. Alternatively, in primarily decentralized purchasing organizations the corporate
purchasing department serves the entire organization in a staff or support role.
</p>
<p>Gaining spend visibility meant mapping how products were sourced and how decisions were
made. From this evolved a standardized strategic sourcing process that involves seven steps.
These are (1) understand internal spend and external markets; (2) create a go-to-market
approach; (3) open the supply base and identify all viable suppliers; (4) decide the most ap-
propriate execution strategy; (5) conduct aggressive negotiations and select suppliers; (6) oper-
ationalize supplier agreements; and (7) monitor the market and supplier performance.
</p>
<p>Once the standardized process was in place, Tyco worked to customize the process to each
segment. Tyco refers to this as stakeholder mapping. Stakeholder mapping is a six-step pro-
cess: (1) determine who the stakeholders are and what their needs and concerns are; (2) iden-
tify the key decision makers and methodologies; (3) review the measurement and reporting
structure; (4) assess the maturity of the existing team, activities, and structure; (5) address
the team&rsquo;s skill and resource gaps and identify the best team players; and (6) drive synergis-
tic opportunities.
</p>
<p>The next stage centered on development of customized sourcing teams based on the informa-
tion gained during the previous processes. &ldquo;There was no standard formula,&rdquo; says Davis.
&ldquo;Each and every team requires the appropriate amount of analysis, stakeholder mapping,
and identification of spend. This led to the creation of a number of different types of teams.&rdquo;
Although Tyco worked to create a standard process for its reporting, it was very flexible with
team creation, and the company ended up with a number of different types of successful
teams.
</p>
<p>For example, in the IT spend, &ldquo;We created a team using a model that allows the stake-
holders, who are the subject matter experts, to coordinate and run the sourcing activities
with minimal sourcing support,&rdquo; reports Davis. Stakeholder mapping showed that the stake-
holder base was very knowledgeable and engaged. Four subteams were created: hardware, tel-
ecom, software, and resellers. Subsequently, the first initiatives designed to harvest the low-
hanging fruit proved the team&rsquo;s ability to be successful. The results of the center-led team
approach have been very fruitful; the company&rsquo;s custom-designed energy sourcing team com-

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Several factors determine the degree of centralization or decentralization that an or-
ganization considers when implementing its supply structure. These interaction fac-
tors must be considered in total because decisions should not just focus on one
factor. Oftentimes one of the more dominating factors will move the organization to
a more hybrid form of organization.
</p>
<p>The Firm&rsquo;s Overall Business Strategy
If the organization&rsquo;s strategy is to be responsive to individual customers in differ-
</p>
<p>ent markets, then a more decentralized approach is likely. Conversely, if the organiza-
tion builds its competitive advantage by being more efficient than the competition,
then a more centralized approach to supply will be favored.
</p>
<p>Similarity of Purchases
When purchases are fairly similar across the organization, they can be combined
</p>
<p>for leverage; a more centralized approach is favored. Conversely, if purchases are
very different across business units, an argument could be made for decentralization.
</p>
<p>Total Purchase Dollar Expenditures
As the physical size of the purchase expenditure increases, the pressure to central-
</p>
<p>ize becomes more pronounced. There is a perceived opportunity to garner savings on
and better manage these large purchase expenditures on a centralized basis; histori-
cally, geographic dispersion resulted in more decentralized structures, whereas geo-
graphic concentration permitted easier centralization. However, technology has leveled
the geography variable. It enables increased spend visibility regardless of location.
</p>
<p>The Overall Philosophy of Management
If upper management is committed to operating in a decentralized mode, then of-
</p>
<p>tentimes the purchasing function will be decentralized. If the management philoso-
phy is more to control the operations from a central location, then a more centralized
approach to supply will likely follow.
</p>
<p>Advantages of Centralized/Centrally Led Purchasing
Structures
</p>
<p>A centrally led purchasing effort can provide some definite advantages, particu-
larly when an organization has purchase expenditures at more than one business
unit, division, or facility. The mission of the central group is to facilitate the consolida-
tion of similar buying requirements and standardize buying processes at the various
facilities. Fulfilling this mission involves many tasks, including the selection of suppli-
ers and negotiation of purchase contracts on a corporatewide basis. Although there
are many potential benefits to centrally led purchasing, the following highlights the
more important advantages.
</p>
<p>Consolidate Purchase Volumes
Historically, the primary advantage of centralized purchasing has been to realize a
</p>
<p>favorable price due to accumulated volumes. Spend analysis involves using systems
technology to identify items purchased in common among divisions or business units.
These items are then consolidated, and a purchasing strategy is developed as to how

<p>Chapter 5 Purchasing and Supply Chain Organization 167</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>to obtain the best value for the entire organization. Depending on the items, business
unit or facility purchasing personnel provide their input to the centralized sourcing
team. Local supply managers also retain the authority to generate orders directly to a
supplier. A firm can achieve material cost reductions by combining purchase vol-
umes while still meeting the operating requirements of division or plant buyers.
</p>
<p>Centrally led buying can also enhance service requirements. For example, a company-
wide transportation contract results in not only cost reductions but also more uniform,
consistent performance standards across all locations. General Electric established a cen-
tral executive transportation committee comprised of divisional transportation man-
agers. This committee acts as a central body to evaluate carriers for corporate
transportation contracts, award corporate contracts to the best carriers, and establish
uniform carrier performance standards for all divisions. By combining transportation
volumes, GE realizes cost and service improvements that benefit the entire corporation.
</p>
<p>Reduced Duplication of Purchasing Effort
Another reason for centrally controlling purchasing authority is to reduce duplica-
</p>
<p>tion of effort. Consider an organization with 10 locations and a completely decen-
tralized purchasing structure. This company may find itself with 10 sets of material
release forms, 10 supplier quality standards, 10 supplier performance evaluation sys-
tems, 10 purchasing training manuals, and 10 different ERP systems with different
communications protocols to the same suppliers. Duplication adds costs but very lit-
tle in the way of unique value. It is costly and inefficient, and it creates a lack of con-
sistency between operating units.
</p>
<p>Ability to Coordinate Purchasing Plans and Strategy
Several strategy development trends are occurring today. First, purchasing is be-
</p>
<p>coming less of a tactical function and more of a strategic function. Second, organiza-
tions are linking corporate, operations, and purchasing plans into an overall strategic
plan. These two trends require a centrally led group responsible for developing pur-
chasing strategy at the highest levels of an organization. Without this group, an orga-
nization cannot coordinate its purchasing strategy. Chapter 6 describes the strategy
development process in detail.
</p>
<p>Ability to Coordinate and Manage Companywide Purchasing Systems
Sophisticated ERP systems, e-purchasing systems, and data warehouses are increas-
</p>
<p>ingly important. The design and coordination of these systems should not be the re-
sponsibility of individual units. If each division or unit is responsible for developing
its own e-purchasing system or data gathering and part-numbering system, the result
will be a mixture of incompatible systems.
</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard, historically a decentralized company, relies on a centrally led pro-
curement group to develop and manage companywide databases. This results in visi-
bility to common items between HP&rsquo;s dozens of divisions as well as the ability to
evaluate supplier performance at the corporate level. The system also supports the de-
velopment of companywide materials forecasts.
</p>
<p>Developing Expertise
Purchasing personnel cannot become experts in all areas of purchasing, especially
</p>
<p>as the purchasing function becomes more complex and sophisticated. The ability to

<p>develop specialized purchasing knowledge and to support individual buying units is an-
other advantage of a centrally led purchasing group. The following list, although not ex-
haustive, presents some of the areas where a central group either develops specialized
expertise or provides training and support to divisional or business unit personnel:
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchase negotiations
&bull; Global sourcing
&bull; Legal aspects
&bull; Quality/Six Sigma programs (e.g., TQM, ISO)
&bull; Supplier relationship management
&bull; Competitive market analysis

&bull; Total cost analysis
&bull; Team building
&bull; Data analysis and information systems
</p>
<p>The Institute for Supply Management (http://www.ism.org) provides information
on training seminars and online learning.
</p>
<p>Managing Companywide Change
Faced with the need to continually anticipate or adapt to changing competitive en-
</p>
<p>vironments, firms restructure to meet these new demands. Purchasing is not spared
from these structural challenges. Although no structure is perfect, there are better
structures at certain points in the firm&rsquo;s life cycle. Often top management philosophy
will dictate the predominant form of organization; however, CPOs must insure that
the form of their organization best meets the overall corporate goals. The example be-
low compares two firms with different organizational approaches to sourcing.
</p>
<p>The first firm had a strong central focus to its major functional activities while the
second had over 80 highly decentralized operating companies. The decentralized com-
pany struggled to initiate change because support or compliance with corporatewide
global purchasing processes was voluntary or not a priority. The centrally focused
company experienced few problems getting participants around the world to support
centrally led initiatives, such as the use of companywide suppliers selected through
its global sourcing process. This example shows that managing the change process is
often easier in a centrally controlled or coordinated purchasing environment.
</p>
<p>Advantages of Decentralized Purchasing
With all the advantages that centrally led or coordinated purchasing appears to of-
</p>
<p>fer, why would any organization support a decentralized structure? Although competi-
tive pressures encourage a more centralized approach to certain tasks, these same
pressures also support the decentralized placement of authority for other purchasing
tasks. A firm can gain an advantage from placing purchasing personnel with sourcing
authority directly &ldquo;where the action is.&rdquo; So what are the potential benefits of decen-
tralizing purchasing authority?

<p>Speed and Responsiveness
The ability to respond quickly to user and customer requirements has always been
</p>
<p>a major justification for decentralized purchasing authority. Most purchasing profes-
sionals agree that decentralized purchasing authority often contributes to greater re-
sponsiveness and support. Organizations may resist a stronger centralized purchasing
group simply because of previous negative experiences with centralized management.
Some organizations fear that any centralization of authority results in slower re-
sponse times.
</p>
<p>Understanding Unique Operational Requirements
Decentralized purchasing personnel should gain a greater understanding and ap-
</p>
<p>preciation of local operating requirements. These personnel become familiar with the
products, processes, business practices, and customers the division or plant serves. In-
creased familiarity allows a buyer to anticipate the needs of the departments it sup-
ports while developing solid relationships with local suppliers. This is especially
important for global companies such as Colgate-Palmolive, which has facilities on
every populated continent.12
</p>
<p>Product Development Support
In organizations where new-product development occurs at the divisional or business
</p>
<p>unit level, a decentralized purchasing structure can support new-product development at
earlier stages. Purchasing can support new-product development in a number of ways.
First, purchasers can involve suppliers early in the product design process. They can also
evaluate longer-term material product requirements, develop strategic plans, determine if
substitute materials are available, and anticipate product requirements.
</p>
<p>Ownership
Organizations may prefer decentralized purchasing authority for an intangible
</p>
<p>reason called ownership. In essence, ownership refers to the assumption that local per-
sonnel understand and support the objectives of the business unit or division and
feel a personal commitment to a particular operation. Business unit managers are re-
sponsible for the profitability of the unit. They should have jurisdiction over purchas-
ing because a large part of the costs and efficiency of the operation are represented in
procurement.
</p>
<p>A Hybrid Purchasing Structure
Exhibit 5.4 presents the results of a study on the decision-making process that
</p>
<p>best describes the current and expected placement of procurement and supply man-
agement authority for a sample of 172 manufacturing companies.13 This exhibit re-
veals an expected shift toward greater centralization over the next five years. This
agrees with another research study that indicated that, whereas the predominant
form of organization in purchasing would be hybrid, it would be accompanied by an
increase in centralized structures.14
</p>
<p>Intense global competition requires firms to develop organizational designs that
capture the advantages of centrally led and decentralized purchasing. Most compa-
nies will likely evolve toward a hybrid organizational structure. A hybrid structure is
one that is neither totally centralized nor totally decentralized. In a hybrid structure,
the authority for some tasks lies with a centrally led group whereas the authority for
other tasks remains at the operating level.

<p>170 Part 2 Purchasing Operations and Structure</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Most organizations should benefit from a structure that retains the advantages
and expertise of a centrally led purchasing group but also is responsive to plant and di-
visional purchasing requirements. Hybrid organizations can take many forms and be
called by many different names. Some of the more common structures include (1)
lead division buying, (2) regional buying groups, (3) global buying committees, (4)
corporate purchasing councils, and (5) corporate steering committees.
</p>
<p>Lead Division Buying
In lead division buying, a group of operating units buy common items, typically be-
</p>
<p>cause they produce common products. For example, one firm combined the efforts
of several plants that produced transformers and distribution equipment for utility
firms. The group first identified common commodities and then appointed a lead ne-
gotiator. The lead negotiator was the buyer at the facility having the largest expendi-
ture or having expertise in the commodity or item purchased.
</p>
<p>Regional Buying Groups
Regional buying groups are most advantageous where geographic concentration ex-
</p>
<p>ists within a company. Various facilities within the particular geographic region (e.g.,
Pacific Northwest, the Southeast) join forces to negotiate with local and regional
sources of common commodities. They generally are responsible for the purchase of
large-volume items common to all facilities. They also assist individual locations
that may or may not have in-house purchasing personnel to handle local purchases.
Regional buying groups are useful in many service organizations (e.g., banks and

<p>insurance companies), given that they are structured on a regional basis. Regional
groups also facilitate implementation of joint inventory sharing and vendor-managed
inventory arrangements with suppliers.
</p>
<p>Global Buying Committees
When a key commodity is purchased by many major business units, a joint global
</p>
<p>strategy is beneficial. For example, one large diversified firm with interests in the de-
fense and automobile parts industry has a worldwide steel-buying committee. The cen-
tral corporate headquarters leads the committee, and every major steel-buying
location has a representative on the committee. Demand forecasts, strategic supplier
purchase plans, and negotiation strategies are established at committee meetings.
</p>
<p>Corporate Purchasing Councils
With smaller centrally led corporate staffs and fewer personnel at the business
</p>
<p>unit level, purchasing councils provide a way to share expertise and develop common
sourcing strategies. A purchasing council is comprised of a group of buyers who pur-
chase similar items at various facilities. A conglomerate organization had been acquir-
ing firms at the rate of one per month for the past 10 years and was left with an
organization of 280 factories. It was decided a center-led form of structure with pur-
chasing councils was needed to reduce the firm&rsquo;s 60,000 suppliers to a manageable
number. As another example, a chemical firm created an MRO council that meets as
needed and members divide up the work. The corporate representative oversees and
coordinates the council members&rsquo; activities. Members are given responsibility for pur-
chases of companywide requirements for which their division is the biggest user. Na-
tional contracts are negotiated and awarded by the center-led corporate group.
</p>
<p>Corporate Steering Committees
Steering committees are quite similar to councils except that they tend to be more ad-
</p>
<p>visory in nature. These committees will meet periodically and discuss strategies on the
company&rsquo;s major purchased commodities. Steering committees will also invite large sup-
pliers in for discussions, negotiations, performance assessments, and forecasts of pur-
chase volumes for the coming year. They provide an opportunity for various operating-
unit personnel to meet and discuss buying plans in decentralized environments.

First Chief Purchasing

<p>Con-way Inc. was named Fortune magazine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Most Admired Company&rdquo; in transporta-
tion and logistics for 2007. The company is a $4.7 billion freight transportation and logistics
services company, with over 30,000 employees with decades of transportation experience.
However, it was not until February of 2006 that it named Mitch Plaat as its first chief procure-
ment officer (CPO). His charge: improve efficiency, identify savings opportunities, and make
changes to help Con-way be a more successful company.S

<p>172 Part 2 Purchasing Operations and Structure</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Until January 2006, Con-way followed a hybrid purchasing model, with some centralized sourc-
ing and some decentralized buying. Purchasing was focused on three silos: fleet (trucks and
trailers), IT (computer hardware, software, and services), and indirect goods and services.
There were central processes for sourcing fleet and IT, both considered strategic to the trans-
portation and logistics company. But for indirect purchases, the company&rsquo;s 500 locations did
much of the buying, managing relationships with some 35,000 suppliers.
</p>
<p>There was no real oversight or system used by all three groups. Management has approved
Plaat&rsquo;s strategy to restructure supply and backed this up with investments. Such executive
support is helping to break down hurdles that come when centralizing the purchasing func-
tion. &ldquo;The executive team has a vision for procurement,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve allowed us to re-
structure, and they are willing to invest in tools and resources in order to achieve goals
we&rsquo;ve set forth. In the past, most investments were for customer-driven systems. Now, we&rsquo;re
investing in procurement and procurement&rsquo;s ability to deliver competitive value and bottom-
line impact.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In the past year, Plaat and his team have worked to attract talented purchasing profes-
sionals to the new operation, tripling the number of people there to more than 100. Nine in-
dividuals are dedicated to strategic sourcing. They have also invested in sourcing software
provided by Emptoris, providing improved visibility over Con-way&rsquo;s spend.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we started to view procurement differently, we saw that our ultimate goal is not only to de-
liver bottom-line savings to the corporation, but to become world class,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And to do
that, we need to have visibility into our spending. If our CFO asked about our spending on
fuel, we could get to that information, but it wasn&rsquo;t something we had at our fingertips. We
wanted tools to provide that insight.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Plaat states, &ldquo;Even though we thought we were doing a good job, it wasn&rsquo;t until we went
through the process and really used the tools and negotiation tactics that we saw we really
hadn&rsquo;t been doing the best we could. We know there&rsquo;s potential for improvement, especially
in areas that we hadn&rsquo;t been involved in, such as HR services. For instance, we&rsquo;ve never had
a national contract for temporary labor services.&rdquo; Other spend areas ripe for consolidation:
computer hardware, corporate cards, hotels, and rental cars. When the company changed its
name, it negotiated a new contract on driver uniforms with a savings of 26% over the previ-
ous contract. Waste disposal is another big area that is currently being studied by Plaat&rsquo;s
team. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking at various options&mdash;whether or not there&rsquo;s a single supplier that can pro-
vide coverage over 500 locations&mdash;but we definitely think there&rsquo;s leverage to be had by consol-
idating the spend with a fixed number of suppliers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The move to a more centralized structure should allow further savings on Con-way&rsquo;s total
spend of about $500 million annually. This spend covers a wide range of goods and ser-
vices, from heavy-duty tractors, trucks, and trailers to fuel, tires, computers, and office sup-
plies. Currently, savings on these purchases average 20% and are due mainly to
consolidating the buy with fewer suppliers. Further savings are likely in areas such as hu-
man resources, marketing, and legal services categories, which purchasing has not tradition-
ally been involved in.
</p>
<p>Another phase in Con-way&rsquo;s centralization initiative toward becoming a world-class purchasing
operation: developing processes for managing contracts and measuring supplier performance.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Organizing for Supply Chain Management
The need to coordinate and share information across organizations and functional
</p>
<p>groups has resulted in the development of higher-level positions designed to oversee
various supply chain activities. Chapter 1 identifies the activities that fall under the
supply chain umbrella.
</p>
<p>A structure that coordinates the diverse activities within a supply chain contrasts
greatly with one where separate supply chain groups or activities report to different
executive managers. The latter model can result in each function or activity pursuing
conflicting organizational goals and objectives. Organizing as an integrated supply
chain structure requires traditionally separate activities to report to an executive re-
sponsible for coordinating the flow of goods, services, and information from supplier
through customer.
</p>
<p>Most large organizations have materials or supply chain executives responsible for
coordinating separate supply chain activities. Historically, the concept of supply
chain management evolved from earlier organizational forms called materials man-
agement and physical distribution. In fact, some organizations still maintain these as
organizational functions. Materials management was a consolidation of functions re-
quired to purchase, manage inbound transportation for, receive, store, inventory, and
schedule material flows. Physical distribution then took the finished product to mar-
ket either directly or through warehouses. Earlier research revealed that 70% of U.S.
operations organizations used the materials concept (i.e., the predecessor to supply
chain management) to some extent, a figure that was consistent across all sizes of or-
ganizations.15 Historically, the greatest growth of the materials management concept
occurred during the mid-1960s to late 1970s.
</p>
<p>In the 1980s and through the mid-1990s, many firms combined these two func-
tions into logistics. From the mid-1990s and continuing through the current period,
firms realized that other factors such as information and process flows were as impor-
tant as (if not more so than) the physical flow of goods. Hence many adopted the
moniker of &ldquo;supply chain management&rdquo; to indicate this complex web of relation-
ships, processes, and information flows from the supplier to the final customer. Per-
haps one of the best comments that captured this new philosophy was made by
Frederick W. Smith, the chairman and CEO of FedEx, who stated that the &ldquo;informa-
tion about the package is more important than the package itself.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Organizations that develop a coordinated approach to materials and supply chain
management show a greater interest in the control of material costs. This can only in-
crease the importance of purchasing within the organizational hierarchy because of
purchasing&rsquo;s influence on cost and quality.
</p>
<p>It is easy to see why organizations have endorsed the concepts of materials manage-
ment, physical distribution, logistics, and now supply chain management. All these or-
ganizational approaches can lead to some tangible benefits:
</p>
<p>&bull; Controlling material costs while improving customer service
&bull; Developing an awareness of supply chain total cost tradeoffs
&bull; Opening channels of communication that promote the sharing of ideas
across organizations and functional groups
</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting the career paths of talented personnel by providing the means to
develop multifunctional expertise

<p>&bull; Developing operating efficiencies across various supply chain activities to
streamline material processes, coordinate procedures, and improve move-
ment of materials and data
</p>
<p>&bull; Creating a direct link from the customer back to external suppliers
</p>
<p>Advances in software and systems have enabled visibility across the supply chain
that allow multiple participants to coordinate and schedule more efficient material in-
formation and processes. Ideally, there is increased access to demand forecasts, pro-
duction requirements, and inventory levels at any point within the supply chain.
Each party could now plan its own production and distribution requirements with
greater accuracy. The result of this integration will be lower inventories, shorter cycle
times, an improved ability to plan, and lower costs.
</p>
<p>A Supply Chain Management Structure
The first chapter of this book identified the various activities that fall under the
</p>
<p>supply chain umbrella. Key processes found in an integrated supply chain include (1)
customer relationship management; (2) customer service management; (3) demand
management; (4) order fulfillment; (5) manufacturing flow management; (6) sourc-
ing; (7) product development and commercialization; and (8) return channel pro-
cesses.16 Exhibit 5.5 on p. 176 illustrates one possible way to structure around supply
chain management.
</p>
<p>The actual groups under the supply chain umbrella can vary widely among orga-
nizations. The reporting level of the supply chain executive can also be higher or
lower than shown here. In this exhibit, patterned after a high-tech company in Massa-
chusetts, the vice president of supply chain management is responsible for materials
sourcing, production planning and scheduling, logistics, operations, and customer ser-
vice. The director of materials is responsible for receiving and storage, inventory con-
trol, and inbound transportation. This shows only one of many possible ways to
integrate supply chain management through the formal organizational structure.
</p>
<p>Using Teams as Part of the Organizational Structure
We have witnessed an increased reliance on teams over the last 25 years. In pur-
</p>
<p>chasing and supply chain management, teams are used to evaluate and select suppli-
ers, develop global commodity strategies, perform demand and supply planning, and
carry out supplier development activities.
</p>
<p>Not all observers agree that the use of teams is a guarantee of greater effective-
ness. Although teams can yield the benefits envisioned by their use, they often have a
less-than-desirable side. They can waste the time and energy of members, enforce
lower performance norms, create destructive conflict within and between teams, and
make notoriously bad decisions. Teams can also exploit, stress, and frustrate mem-
bers&mdash;sometimes all at the same time.17
</p>
<p>If we believe that making teams a major part of the formal organizational struc-
ture does not guarantee success, then the challenge becomes one of creating an envi-
ronment where teams will be successful. Much of the success or failure of teams rests
on an organization&rsquo;s ability to ask the right questions about using teams. Exhibit 5.6
on p. 177 identifies the kinds of questions that supply managers should ask when
they are planning to use teams.

<p>Although most supply managers endorse the use of teams, the reality is that there
are major hurdles or challenges that can affect how well an organization uses them.
First, many organizations form teams using part-time members. Although some orga-
nizations create teams staffed by full-time members, teams staffed by part-time mem-
bers are popular within purchasing and supply chain management. Organizations
that rely on part-time teams typically maintain their existing functional structure
while adding additional team-related duties. It can be difficult to obtain commitment
from members who face conflicting demands on their time.
</p>
<p>A second hurdle that still confronts too many organizations is a failure to recog-
nize and reward the effort team members put forth toward their assignments. In fact,
many recognition and reward systems today encourage members not to participate

<p>Form Work Team and Select Qualified Members and Leader
Have core versus as-needed members been identified?
Do members have the proper skills, time, and commitment to support the team?
Have team sponsors identified and selected a qualified team leader?

<p>on teams. Members who receive inadequate recognition for their efforts will likely di-
rect their energy toward those areas that are recognized and rewarded. Participation
may present a personal risk and create conflict once members realize that supporting
a team takes time away from activities that are recognized and rewarded. Unfortu-
nately, many companies still do not grasp the importance of this issue.
</p>
<p>A third hurdle relates to our individualistic national culture. It is simply not our na-
ture, except perhaps for sporting events, to be group or team focused, especially
when compared to other countries. In his study of culture, Hofstede concluded that
the United States was the most individualistic nation of any studied.18 Although
some cultures place group needs above individual needs, this is usually not the case
within the United States. Team participants may perceive that group assignments will
stifle individual creativity and personal recognition. We value individualism and find
that a shift away from it is often uncomfortable and threatening.
</p>
<p>Although these barriers are important, they certainly do not represent an exhaus-
tive list of what can affect purchasing and supply chain teams. In fact, a host of bar-
riers may affect a specific team at a given point in time. Supply leaders must
understand how to use this demanding but often difficult way to perform work.
</p>
<p>Creating the Organization of the Future
A major debate today continues to be about determining the best organizational
</p>
<p>structure, including the structure for purchasing and integrated supply chain manage-
ment. The trend today is to move away from a vertical focus, where work and infor-
mation are managed up and down within functional groups, toward a horizontal
focus, where work and information are managed across groups and between organiza-
tions. The horizontal organization largely eliminates hierarchy and functional or de-
partmental boundaries. Although there will always be a need for functional groups,
increasingly parts of the organization will work together horizontally in teams or
groups to perform core processes. Exhibit 5.7 compares the vertical and horizontal ap-
proaches to structuring organizations. It is easy to see how a horizontal focus applies
to purchasing and supply chain management.
</p>
<p>There is some evidence that purchasing is beginning to assume a horizontal rather
than strictly vertical focus. Almost 80% of companies surveyed use cross-functional
teams to manage some part of the purchasing and supply chain management pro-
cess. We have also witnessed a shift over the last 15 years from a commodity focus
to one that is end-item or process focused. In 1990, purchasing was organized
around commodities in almost 80% of firms surveyed. By 1999, purchasing was orga-
nized by commodities less than 65% of the time.19 A shift has occurred toward orga-
nizing around end items (which supports new-product development efforts) and
hybrid structures, such as organizing around processes. Of course, few organizations
will choose to be purely vertical or purely horizontal. Most will create structures that
attempt to capture the best that vertical and horizontal alignments have to offer.
</p>
<p>The ideal procurement organizational model in the 21st century should have cer-
tain broad features. These include flattened hierarchies for faster decision making
and freer flow of ideas along with joint ventures and alliances with key supply chain
members. Future organizational designs should also feature cross-functional teams to
pursue new opportunities and cross-fertilize ideas across organizations. Greater decen-
tralization of buying activity along with centrally led coordination of major spending

<p>categories should provide the best that centralization and decentralization have to
offer. Open information channels&mdash;the Internet, intranets, and information technol-
ogy systems that make information widely available across the supply chain&mdash;will
help coordinate activities across the organizational chart. Finally, rotation of man-
agers across business units and functional groups will support the development of
broad knowledge and expertise. Thriving in a fast-paced environment requires new
kinds of leadership and organizational designs. A design with the right features can
help a company meet the challenges of the 21st century.

years? Exhibit 5.8 on p. 180 presents the top 12 expected purchasing organizational

<p>172 manufacturing firms. From this list we see a number of themes emerge that be-
gin to define the purchasing organization of the future. First, companies expect to
rely extensively on the use of teams to support the attainment of procurement objec-
tives. This includes commodity teams, teams that manage some or all of the procure-
ment and supply process, and new-product development teams. Next, new-product
development teams will feature the active involvement of purchasing and supplier rep-
resentatives. Third, because purchasing is a support activity, the co-location of pur-
chasing personnel with internal customers is an important way to be responsive to
internal customer needs. Exhibit 5.9 presents the kinds of insights that purchasing per-
sonnel should gain from closer interaction with internal customers.
</p>
<p>Strategy development and the need for procurement leadership are also evident
from the top 12 list. One highly rated feature is a higher-level chief procurement officer
who makes regular strategy and performance review presentations to the president or
CEO. The need to coordinate procurement strategy with other functional groups and
between business units also reflects a growing reliance on purchasing to demonstrate
leadership, to support corporate objectives, and to work cross-functionally.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 5.8 also notes the importance of relying on lead buyers to manage non-
commodity goods and services along with the importance of having specific individuals
responsible for managing supplier relationships. These features combine to help create
a picture of what the purchasing organization of the future will resemble.
</p>
<p>The supply chain organization of the future will rely much more on systems capa-
bility to enable the efficient and effective management of the flow of goods informa-
tion and processes from suppliers to final customers. These technology-enabled
supply chains will permit several advantages. Perhaps one of the greatest advantages
will be viewing the process as circular rather than linear. This feature will allow any
members, regardless of their position in the chain, to access activities either upstream
or downstream. Thus, a final customer will have visibility into the shipment activity
of a key supplier. Another key activity is the ability to bring together a firm&rsquo;s exper-
tise in the form of a virtual team to address a problem, provide alternatives and rec-
ommended solutions, and then disband.

<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Uses
Organizational Design to
Integrate Marketing and
Purchasing
</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, a global company known for high-quality products and brands, is
showing how the creative use of organizational design can promote integration between
some important supply chain groups. Supply management professionals, who are part of the
support activity called procurement, have a wide range of internal customers. One internal
customer group is marketing, which is responsible for activities that could benefit from the in-
volvement of professional supply managers.
</p>
<p>Executive managers have assigned a sourcing manager to J&amp;J&rsquo;s corporate marketing and pro-
motion strategy team to support their efforts when developing contracts. Examples of service
areas where the marketing team requires contract support include printing, convention and
meeting space, media purchases, promotional displays and tradeshows, marketing research,
and advertising and promotion. For example, sourcing involvement resulted in a reduction of
companywide printing suppliers from 600 to 5.
</p>
<p>By being part of the marketing strategy team, the sourcing professional adds value to the
marketing and promotion process. She verifies that every unit within the corporation is
charged the same best rate from suppliers and reserves the right to audit advertising &ldquo;job
jackets&rdquo; and costs. She controls the buying of advertising and media support while working
to gain most-favored-customer status with media suppliers. In short, she assumes a major
part of the contracting process that marketing simply does not want. This allows marketing

<p>Good Practice
Example
</p>
<p>Air Products and Chemi-
cals Organizes to Meet
Global Challenges
</p>
<p>Air Products and Chemicals, an industrial producer of gases and chemicals head-
quartered in the eastern United States, designs and operates production facilities worldwide.
Unfortunately, industrial buyers are increasingly viewing the company&rsquo;s products as commod-
ity items, which, along with intense global competition from China and other countries, has
created extensive downward price pressures. This has created the primary challenge that Air
Products faces&mdash;margins are under pressure, yet the company has made strong performance
commitments to shareholders.
</p>
<p>Air Products has operated historically as an engineer-to-order company, which implies a
great deal of engineering and design work customized to each new facility and project. En-
gineers traditionally design new facilities without considering previous designs or leveraging
commonality across design and procurement centers. Management now recognizes the com-
pany must pursue standard-design and off-the-shelf-product-based thinking. The company&rsquo;s
objective is to enter the global marketplace as a global rather than regional company. Achiev-
ing that objective demanded the development of a globally integrated engineering and pro-
curement process.
</p>
<p>GLOBAL ENGINEERING AND PROCUREMENT PROCESS
Responding to the call to globalize engineering and procurement, the director of project and
logistics supply assembled a leadership team to develop, sell internally, and launch the com-
pany&rsquo;s global process. The process that Air Products developed involves an extensive analy-
sis between the U.S. and European design centers to determine areas of commonality and
synergy. Although the process began with focused commodities, projects became broader in
scope once the cost-saving possibilities became obvious.
</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT MECHANISMS
Perhaps the major reason Air Products has enjoyed success with its global engineering and
procurement process is due to the organizational design features the company has put in
place. These features include two steering committees, a globalization manager, and exten-
sive use of cross-functional/cross-locational teams.
</p>
<p>Steering Committees
Two steering committees support the global process&mdash;an executive steering committee and
an operating steering committee. The executive steering committee consists of senior man-
agers from engineering, procurement, and operations. Financial representatives support the
group as required. This committee brings higher-level commitment and exposure to the
global process. The committee also allocates the budget that supports a globalization man-
ager and staff along with travel and living expenses for team members.

<p>182 Part 2 Purchasing Operations and Structure</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A globalization manager, a project procurement manager, and the director of Asian sourcing
(who commits a part of his effort to the global process) comprise the core operating steering
committee. The steering committee, working with the globalization manager, assumes some
important responsibilities. This committee identifies and prioritizes global opportunities, estab-
lishes cross-functional teams, and identifies savings targets. Committee members also work
to remove any hurdles that affect the process. The operating steering committee also has re-
sponsibility for maintaining online support documents, updating the status of projects on the
company&rsquo;s intranet, and conducting lessons-learned sessions with teams at the end of each
project.
</p>
<p>Globalization Manager
Consensus exists among managers concerning the importance of the globalization manager,
a position created specifically to oversee the global engineering and procurement process.
This manager, who is also the operating steering committee leader, is a well-respected engi-
neer with 25 years of experience. He reports to the vice presidents of engineering in Europe
and the United States. This is an important consideration because the two design centers
must work together during global projects. He has located his office with the procurement
group at U.S. headquarters, which facilitates teamwork and trust between engineering and
procurement.
</p>
<p>The globalization manager commits 100% of his time to supporting the global process. His re-
sponsibilities include working with the operating steering committee to identify future proj-
ects, monitoring the status and progress of current projects, and determining where to spend
budgeted funds. He also approves all operating steering committee expenditures and identi-
fies team members for project teams, including working with other managers to gain support
and member time. The globalization manager also plays an important role in helping teams
establish project milestones.
</p>
<p>CROSS-FUNCTIONAL / CROSS-LOCATIONAL TEAMS
Air Products relies extensively on cross-functional/cross-locational teams to support global en-
gineering and procurement. These teams, which typically have four to six members, are re-
sponsible for developing and proposing global sourcing strategies. The steering committee
selects members on the basis of experience and confidence in an individual&rsquo;s ability to
support the team. Each team has representatives from the United States and Europe
participating.
</p>
<p>Project teams follow a nine-step global process, which includes regular reporting of progress
to the operating steering committee. Perhaps the most important responsibility performed by
these project teams is the development of a hypothetical material cost that identifies where
savings can be realized. Savings occur primarily in three areas: (1) material savings, (2) cur-
rency savings, and (3) savings due to opening a purchase requirement to competition.
</p>
<p>Has Air Products been successful? With over 100 projects completed, the company is averag-
ing 20% cost savings compared with previous agreements. Executive management considers
the global process to be one of the more important internal processes in place at Air Prod-
ucts today. Success would not be possible, however, without careful attention to the right or-
ganizational design&mdash;a design that recognizes the importance of leadership, coordination,
communication, and resource support.

<p>CONCLUSION
Just as having the right people, systems, and performance measures in place is criti-
</p>
<p>cal to purchasing success, so too is having a properly designed organizational struc-
ture. Careful attention to assessing and selecting the structure and formal systems of
communication, division of labor, coordination, control, authority, and responsibility
will make the attainment of supply management objectives more likely.
</p>
<p>Without question, the kinds of organizational design features that a firm selects of-
ten relate to the size of the firm. Larger firms differ from smaller firms in terms of
scope, complexity, and available resources. They tend to have operations that are
worldwide (scope), more organizational levels covering a wider array of businesses
and product lines (complexity), and more resources that support the use of certain de-
sign features. As firm size increases, many of the design features put in place help co-
ordinate and integrate a globally diverse and large organization. Whatever the size of
the firm, progressive supply managers recognize the important relationship between
organizational design and supply management effectiveness. Future organizational
structures will need to be more flexible and responsive regardless of whether they are
centralized, decentralized, or hybrid.

<p>Building the 787 Dreamliner: The Critical Role
of Supply Management
</p>
<p>Boeing Co. recently announced that its new wide-body jet, the 787 Dreamliner, will be
delayed by at least six months, a blow for the company&rsquo;s ambitious plan to revamp how it
builds airplanes by having suppliers take on a greater role. Jim McNerney, their CEO, noted
that &ldquo;notwithstanding the challenges that we are experiencing in bringing forward this
game-changing product, we remain confident in the design of the 787, and in the fundamen-
tal innovation and technologies that underpin it.&rdquo; This strategy indeed represents an entirely
new approach to building airplanes that relies much more on sourcing strategy. In planning
for the 787, Boeing remade its production process to rely heavily on major suppliers as risk-
sharing partners. In return for investing more up front and taking on a share of the develop-
ment costs, suppliers have been given major sections of the airplane to build. The wing sec-
tions are made in Japan, whereas factories in Italy, South Carolina, and Wichita, Kansas,
assemble the bulk of the fuselage. The parts are flown aboard modified 757 cargo planes to
Everett, Washington, for final assembly.
</p>
<p>Boeing says that when the system is up and running, it will eventually be able to snap to-
gether Dreamliners in as little as three days, not unlike how plastic model airplanes are as-
sembled. Further, Boeing officials say the system has reduced the company&rsquo;s upfront
development costs by billions of dollars. The downside? Boeing has less control over the
day-to-day progress of the Dreamliner program than it has had for any new airliner in its
history.
</p>
<p>However, unlike the delays that have plagued Airbus, which has delayed its A380 jetliner by
two years, Boeing says the problems don&rsquo;t point to a fundamental flaw in its design, but
rather involve difficulties in the supply chain. For example, since the summer of 2007, the in-
dustry has been beset by a shortage in titanium and aluminum fasteners used to hold air-
planes together. Boeing&rsquo;s problems were exacerbated because suppliers are working with
composite materials instead of the more familiar aluminum. After a major ceremony on July
8 when the first Dreamliner was unveiled before a crowd of more than 15,000 guests, the
plane actually had to be largely disassembled by unfastening the thousands of fasteners on
the body. Suppliers hadn&rsquo;t preinstalled wiring or other major components needed to make
the system work smoothly. Once engineers got inside, it became evident that it would take
more time to put the plane back together than anticipated.
</p>
<p>Outsourcing design to suppliers has definitely proven to increase the risk associated with de-
veloping new products. For more than a year, teams of Boeing experts have lived on the
road, troubleshooting problems at factories all over the globe, and making sure they have
enough raw materials to do their work. In some cases, such as with a factory that was erected
in Charleston, South Carolina, by Italy&rsquo;s Alenia Aeronautica SpA and Bought Aircraft Indus-
tries Inc. of Dallas, relatively inexperienced workers were hired from the local area to begin
building an airplane that is technically more advanced than any commercial airplane in his-
tory! &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a lesson learned, you&rsquo;d start earlier and do a little more training with our peo-
ple there,&rdquo; said Scott Carson, chief executive of Boeing&rsquo;s Commercial Airplanes unit. Carson
noted that unlike the previous schedule, the new delivery schedule has a margin built in for
unexpected problems that might arise during flight testing, which gives Boeing &ldquo;much more
confidence in our ability to deliver this plane on time.&rdquo;

<p>Remaining competitive means that supply management must contribute to profitabil-
ity by focusing on not only cost savings, but contributions to top-line growth and in-
novation. World-class supply management requires that leaders align with business
unit stakeholders, understand their direct and indirect requirements for success, de-
velop a deep insight into the global supply market&rsquo;s ability to meet these requirements,
and negotiate contracts and manage supplier relationships that create a competitive
advantage. This is a dynamic and difficult task, given the complexity and challenges
that exist under current market conditions.
</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on the contribution that supply management can make to a
firm&rsquo;s competitive position and how this contribution should filter down to category
management teams. A category refers to a specific family of products or services that
are used in delivering value to the end customer. We begin by discussing how supply
management executives can contribute to the strategic plan at the companywide
level. In order to contribute to corporate strategy, supply management must be able
to translate corporate objectives into specific supply management goals. Supply man-
agement goals serve as the driver for both strategic supply management processes
and detailed commodity strategies&mdash;specific action plans that detail how goals are
achieved through relationships with suppliers. To illustrate this, we provide a step-
by-step process employed by category teams that is used to define business require-
ments, research the supply market, and develop a plan to source the product or
services. We conclude with some specific examples of category strategies that best-
in-class firms are deploying to cope with an increasingly challenging set of circum-
stances in today&rsquo;s supply market.
</p>
<p>Aligning Supply Management and
Enterprise Objectives
</p>
<p>A company&rsquo;s leadership team, in defining how the firm will compete and succeed
in the global environment, must clearly and succinctly communicate the following to
their executive team:
</p>
<p>&bull; What markets will the firm compete in, and on what basis?
</p>
<p>&bull; What are the long-term and short-term business goals the company seeks to
achieve?
</p>
<p>&bull; What are the budgetary and economic resource constraints, and how will
these be allocated to functional groups and business units?
</p>
<p>When faced with these challenges, business unit functions must then work together
to define their functional strategies, which are a set of short-term and long-term
plans that will support the enterprise strategy.
</p>
<p>The first part of this process requires that the leadership team understand its key
markets and economic forecasts, and provide a clear vision of how the enterprise
will differentiate itself from its competitors, achieve growth objectives, manage costs,
achieve customer satisfaction, and maintain continued profitability in order to meet
or exceed the expectations of stakeholders.
</p>
<p>Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to go into detail regarding corpo-
rate strategies, the economics associated with corporate strategy are fairly straightfor-
ward. An organization must take in more revenues than it spends on operating costs

<p>in the long term to grow and increase profits. As shown in Exhibit 6.1, there are two
fundamental ways of balancing this equation: increase revenues or decrease costs.
</p>
<p>Increasing revenues involves either raising prices or keeping prices stable and in-
creasing volume. Simultaneously, costs must be held steady or must increase at a rate
smaller than the rate of increasing revenues. However, this option has become increas-
ingly more difficult to realize over the last several years. Since 2004, prices for com-
modities such as nickel, steel, oil and gas, coal, resin feedstocks, and copper have
doubled or tripled. To combat these trends, many firms have sought new suppliers in
China, India, and Asia, to counteract these higher costs with lower labor costs. As a re-
sult, inflation has been largely kept at bay, and the number of competitively priced,
higher-quality products has increased. Today, there are only a few markets in which
a seller can increase or even hold prices steady. For example, the price of auto-
mobiles has remained largely stable, even as the cost of materials going into these
cars has increased dramatically.
</p>
<p>Reducing costs has become an area of intense interest. Faced with global competi-
tion, companies are constantly searching for ways to reduce costs and pass the sav-
ings on to customers while preserving their profit margins and maintaining a return
to shareholders.
</p>
<p>Reducing the cost of materials and services has remained an important enterprise
objective. Another is innovation. Firms are constantly seeking to find the next new
technology that will create new markets and capture a share of consumers&rsquo; wallets.
Consider the iPod and the massive market for online music that followed this
innovation.

<p>Integrative Strategy Development
The process of aligning supply management goals with corporate objectives is espe-
</p>
<p>cially important for supply management and supply chain managers. These managers
often face some very broad directives from corporate management&mdash;for example, to
reduce costs or to improve quality. The strategy development process takes place on
four levels:
</p>
<p>&bull; Corporate Strategies: These strategies are concerned with (1) the definition
of businesses in which the corporation wishes to participate and (2) the ac-
quisition and allocation of resources to these business units.
</p>
<p>&bull; Business Unit Strategies: These strategies are concerned with (1) the scope
or boundaries of each business and the links with corporate strategy and
(2) the basis on which the business unit will achieve and maintain a
competitive advantage within an industry.
</p>
<p>&bull; Supply Management Strategies: These strategies, which are part of a level of
strategy development called functional strategies, specify how supply manage-
ment will (1) support the desired competitive business-level strategy and
(2) complement other functional strategies (such as marketing and
operations).
</p>
<p>&bull; Commodity Strategies: These strategies specify how a group tasked with
developing the strategy for the specific commodity being purchased will
achieve goals that in turn will support the supply management&ndash;, business
unit&ndash;, and ultimately corporate-level strategies.
</p>
<p>Companies that are successful in deploying supply chain strategies do so because the
strategy development process is integrative. This means that the strategy is drafted by
(or has significant input from) those people responsible for implementation.

<p>Integrative supply chain strategies occur when corporate strategic plans are effec-
tively &ldquo;cascaded&rdquo; into specific supply management and commodity goals, through a se-
ries of iterative planning stages (shown in Exhibit 6.2). Corporate strategy evolves
from corporate objectives, which effectively evolve from a corporate mission state-
ment drafted by the chief executive officer (CEO), functional executives, and the
board of directors. Corporate strategies are crafted by the CEO, taking into consider-
ation the organization&rsquo;s competitive strengths, business unit and functional capabili-
ties, market objectives, competitive pressures and customer requirements, and
macroeconomic trends. What distinguishes an integrative strategy development pro-
cess is that business unit executives, as well as corporate supply management execu-
tives, provide direct input during the development of corporate strategy.
</p>
<p>Translating Supply Management Objectives into
Supply Management Goals
</p>
<p>A major output of the strategy development process is a set of functional strategic
objectives, including supply management strategic objectives. As supply management
managers interact with other members within their business, as well as with cor-
porate executives, a major set of strategic directives should begin to emerge. These
strategic objectives may or may not provide details concerning how they are to be
achieved. However, the process is not yet complete. Unless supply management execu-
tives can effectively translate broad-level objectives into specific supply management
goals, these strategies will never be realized.
</p>
<p>Supply management must couple each objective with a specific goal that it can
measure and act upon. These specific goals become the initial step for a detailed com-
modity strategy formulation process. Remember&mdash;objectives drive goals, whether at
the highest levels of an organization or at the functional or department level. The fol-
lowing are examples of corporatewide supply management goals associated with vari-
ous supply management objectives.
</p>
<p>Cost-Reduction Objective
&bull; Be the low-cost producer within our industry. (Goal: Reduce material costs
by 15% in one year.)
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduce the levels of inventory required to supply internal customers. (Goal:
Reduce raw material inventory to 20 days&rsquo; supply or less.)
</p>
<p>Technology/New-Product Development Objective
&bull; Outsource non-core-competency activities. (Goal: Qualify two new suppliers
for all major services by end of the fiscal year.)
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduce product development time. (Goal: Develop a formal supplier integra-
tion process manual by the end of the fiscal year.)
</p>
<p>Supply Base Reduction Objective
&bull; Reduce the number of suppliers used. (Goal: Reduce the total supply base by
30% over the next six months.)
</p>
<p>&bull; Joint problem-solve with remaining suppliers. (Goal: Identify $300,000 in po-
tential cost savings opportunities with two suppliers by the end of the fiscal
year.)

Snapshot
</p>
<p>Ford Rebuilds Its
Supply Base
</p>
<p>In the latest sign of how U.S. automakers are rethinking their business, Ford Motor Co.
plans to overhaul its $90-billion-a-year global purchasing process to offer larger, long-term
contracts to a smaller group of suppliers on future models, a switch that could save billions
of dollars a year. In particular, Ford will tap seven major suppliers in its initial effort to
streamline parts purchasing (see table below as compiled from company sources).
</p>
<p>The initial phase of the plan covers more than $35 billion in Ford purchasing for 20 key
parts such as seats, tires, and bumpers. Ford will cut by more than half the number of suppli-
ers from whom it buys these parts, starting with vehicles that will be built in 2008&ndash;2009
and beyond, Ford officials said.
</p>
<p>That effort in turn promises a shake-up in the beleaguered auto-parts industry, a key part of
the nation&rsquo;s manufacturing base. In recent months, several auto suppliers have filed for Chap-
ter 11 bankruptcy protection amid broader pressure on the industry from the rising price of
oil, steel, and other commodities and their inability to raise prices as car companies main-
tain steep consumer discounts.
</p>
<p>Globally, there are an estimated 5,000 direct suppliers of parts to the auto industry, with com-
bined sales in excess of $500 billion, according to CSM, a Farmington Hills, Michigan&ndash;based
auto research and production firm.
</p>
<p>Ford&rsquo;s move to revamp how it buys everything from paint to health care is the latest stage
in the efforts of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Clay Ford Jr. to turn around
the nation&rsquo;s No. 2 automaker, whose automotive business reported a $1.1 billion operating
loss in the second quarter and whose debt recently was downgraded to junk-bond status. It
comes at a time when the big U.S. automakers are facing profit-margin squeezes from steep
discounting, rising gasoline prices, and fierce competition from Asian rivals.

<p>Quality Objective
&bull; Increase quality of services and products. (Goal: Reduce average defects by
200 ppm on all material receipts within one year.)
</p>
<p>The next level of detail requires translating companywide supply management goals
into specific commodity-level goals.
</p>
<p>What Is a Category Strategy?
Although not always the case, companies often use commodity teams to develop
</p>
<p>supply management strategies. Supply management strategies often apply to catego-
ries&mdash;general families of purchased products or services. Examples of major commod-
ity classifications across different industries include body side moldings (automotive),
microprocessors (computer), steel (metalworking), cotton (apparel), wood (pulp and
paper), petroleum products (chemicals), outsourced business processes (IT program-
ming, call centers), and office supplies (all industries). A category team is often com-
posed of personnel from the operational group, product design, process engineering,
marketing, finance, and supply management. The personnel involved should be famil-
iar with the commodity being evaluated.
</p>
<p>For instance, if the team is tasked with supply management computers, then users
from information systems should be included. If the team purchases vehicles and vehi-
cle parts, then it would be a good idea to include maintenance managers who are fa-
miliar with the characteristics of these commodities. In general, the more important
the commodity, the more likely that cross-functional members and user groups will
be involved. Together, the commodity team will develop a commodity strategy that
provides the specific details and outlines the actions to follow in managing the
commodity.
</p>
<p>As noted in previous sections and shown in Exhibit 6.2, supply management de-
rives its strategic direction from corporate objectives and the business unit strategy de-
velopment process.
</p>
<p>The business unit functional strategy acts as the driver for the cross-organizational
supply management strategies that emerge for the major products and services pur-
chased by the business unit. These in turn translate into supply management goals.
Once supply management has identified a set of broad-level goals that it must
achieve, another set of more detailed strategies should emerge at the commodity/ser-
vice/product family level. The process of supply management strategy deployment ef-
fectively begins at the commodity/product family level.
</p>
<p>Before initiating any category strategy, there must be buy-in from the key stake-
holders, especially at the senior leadership level. Without executive commitment, stra-
tegic sourcing results are unlikely to be successful. To ensure buy-in of the corporate
team, supply management must clearly define the &ldquo;prize&rdquo; or carrot at the end of the
stick, to obtain the go-ahead to pursue the strategy. To enable an effective category
strategy, the team must:
</p>
<p>1. Spend money on resources initially, including assessment of current spend,
data collection, market research, training, and people.
</p>
<p>2. Validate the savings or contribution to other company objectives achieved by
supply management and drive them to the bottom line.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3. Sustain the initiative through presentations to senior executives who support
the move toward an integrated supply management function with other func-
tional groups in the supply chain, including marketing, research and develop-
ment, and accounting.
</p>
<p>The individual who will ensure that this can happen will often report to the chief fi-
nancial officer (CFO)&mdash;so making a solid business case is an important element in
building support for category strategies in most firms.
</p>
<p>A study1 conducted by Accenture, Stanford, and INSEAD found that 89% of se-
nior executives at leading companies view supply chains as critical or very important
to their company and industry, and 89% also agreed investments in supply chain capa-
bilities have increased in the last three years. Chief financial officers are especially in-
terested. Driven by cost-cutting needs and general dissatisfaction with supply chain
performance, CFOs are adding supply chain management to the financial levers they
already control.2 They see this activity as integral to meeting their strategic goals and
view the supply chain as having a large or very important effect on their ability to
achieve corporate objectives. Above all else, CFOs consider reducing operating costs
as a key goal of their supply chain, with improving customer service coming in a
close second. This suggests that CFOs are not just obsessed with financial rigor but
also appreciate the importance of customer-relationship management to the future of
their organizations.
</p>
<p>According to the survey, 34% of CFOs have taken more of a leadership role in sup-
ply chain management, and 49% believe that they will be playing such a role in two
years. And CFOs see themselves as suited to the task; they wield significant corporate
power, yet have no ax to grind in a supply chain sense because they are not bound
by the traditional political and organizational ties that anchor this discipline within
companies. CFOs can bring &ldquo;a certain degree of coherence to what may be a frag-
mented reporting structure,&rdquo; said Gene Long, president of UPS Consulting. Because
they are already charged with managing cash and capital allocations, in a supply
chain sense they &ldquo;probably are in a critical position to be able to manage the trade-
offs that should be made,&rdquo; Long said. Also, he said CFOs are adept at quantifying
value, something that supply management can benefit from. In many cases this is al-
ready happening; 20% of respondents said that senior supply chain professionals al-
ready report to the CFO, but the survey indicates that this will become more
widespread, enabling financial executives to take a more proactive role.
</p>
<p>The most common approach for building a business case is through an annual pro-
cess review of where the company is spending its money: the &ldquo;spend analysis.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Conducting a Spend Analysis
As we discussed in Chapter 2, a robust procure to pay process is critical, in order
</p>
<p>to facilitate an accurate spend analysis. Why is it important to capture the transaction-
level data associated with all purchasing processes? Because from time to time the
firm must identify opportunities for savings through a process known as a spend
analysis. A spend analysis becomes a critical input into building category strategies.
</p>
<p>A spend analysis is an annual review of a firm&rsquo;s entire set of purchases. This re-
view provides answers to the following questions:
</p>
<p>&bull; What did the business spend its money on over the past year? (This value is
an important component in calculating the cost of goods sold in the financial

<p>&bull; Did the business receive the right amount of products and services given
what it paid for them? (This is an important requirement to meet the legal re-
quirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, which requires accountability and cor-
rect reporting of financial statements to the SEC.)
</p>
<p>&bull; What suppliers received the majority of the business, and did they charge an
accurate price across all the divisions in comparison to the requirements in
the POs, contracts, and statements of work? (This is an important compo-
nent to ensure contract compliance.)
</p>
<p>&bull; Which divisions of the business spent their money on products and services
that were correctly budgeted for? (This is an important component for plan-
ning annual budgets for spending in the coming year.)
</p>
<p>&bull; Are there opportunities to combine volumes of spending from different busi-
nesses, and standardize product requirements, reduce the number of suppli-
ers providing these products, or exploit market conditions to receive better
pricing? (This is an important input into strategic sourcing planning, the
topic of the next chapter in the book.)

<p>marketing, purchasing, and accounting. Despite the importance of this element,
many firms struggle to develop a comprehensive and accurate spend analysis report.
This is because purchasing was for many years a paper-based system, and figures
were not entered correctly into accounting systems. Even with the evolution of sophis-
ticated enterprise systems such as SAP and Oracle, purchasing transactions are often
entered incorrectly, which elicits the old phrase &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out.&rdquo; Another
problem is that many enterprises have grown through mergers and acquisitions.
When a new division is acquired, they may be using a different system from the ac-
quiring company, and so the data is not easily translatable. For this reason, many
firms are undergoing major initiatives to streamline procurement through electronic
procurement systems that will revamp the purchase to pay process and automate dif-
ferent portions to capture transactions more effectively. Indeed, the research shown
by Aberdeen Research in Exhibit 6.3 on p. 197 suggests that &ldquo;best in class&rdquo; firms are
more likely to have a higher proportion of their spend under management, which
has led to important improvements such as cost reductions, reduction of noncompli-
ant purchases, supply base reduction, and electronically enabled suppliers.

<p>Exhibit 6.4 shows spend data sorted by descending dollar. Note that the dataset
contains information on the general classification or &ldquo;commodity,&rdquo; the primary sup-
plier for that category, and the dollar amount spent with that supplier in that com-
modity. It is important to note that there may be multiple suppliers that supply a
single commodity, and vice versa (multiple commodity classifications supplied by a
single supplier). The entire spreadsheet is NOT shown in this case; in fact, the spread-
sheet has over 2,500 lines in it, and this would be considered a simple spend analysis.
Many datasets have literally millions of transactions in them. With this information
in hand, you can proceed as follows:
</p>
<p>1. The first step is to take this information and sort the data by commodity. In
this case, a commodity is a &ldquo;category&rdquo; of spending.
</p>
<p>2. From the commodity sort, find the total spend by commodity. (Hint: The sub-
total or pivot table functions in Excel can help.) Calculate the total spend by
commodity.
</p>
<p>3. Make a chart of the top 10 commodities by descending $ spend. A Pareto
chart is used to show the total value of spend that occurs within each cate-
gory. As shown in Exhibit 6.5, the top 10 categories of spending are rebate ful-
fillment and call center spending, advertising, general contracting, hardware,
investments, paper, service parts, business and management services, contract
labor, and telecommunications. These areas represent the highest level of
spend and, therefore, the biggest opportunity for sourcing analysis and oppor-
tunities for cost savings and price reductions. But we aren&rsquo;t done yet!
</p>
<p>4. From the commodity sort, find the number of suppliers by commodity. (Hint:
The pivot table function in Excel can help.) Perform a descending sort of num-
ber of suppliers by commodity.

<p>5. Make a chart of the top ten commodities by descending number of suppliers.
As shown in Exhibit 6.6, the advertising category has the highest number of
suppliers within it, followed by other miscellaneous small dollar suppliers
(who might be supplying office products or other noncritical items), energy, se-
curity, general contracting, and business and management services. It is amaz-
ing that this firm is using almost 2,500 different suppliers of advertising!
However, this is not uncommon, as business units will often use their own lo-
cal preferred supplier, because they are nearby and they know them. Al-
though this is appropriate in some cases, it may also be an opportunity for
supply base reduction and further cost savings.
</p>
<p>6. From the commodity sort, find the average spend per supplier by commodity.
Perform an ascending sort of average spend per supplier. Exhibit 6.7 shows
the categories that have the lowest volume of spending by supplier. A low
spend per supplier figure is indicative that there are too many suppliers in
that category, as the volume per supplier should be increased. It is interest-
ing that none of these parameters show up in the other two charts, suggesting
that there may or may not be an opportunity worth pursuing in the catego-
ries shown in these charts.
</p>
<p>7. Applying the concept of Pareto analysis to the chart of top 10 commodities by
descending $ spend, what are the recommendations for savings opportunities?
</p>
<p>From Exhibit 6.5, the areas of Rebate Fulfillment and Advertising are clear areas for
savings opportunities. As shown in Exhibit 6.8, total spend for this company is
$2,449,428,985, of which 14% ($342M) and 13.8% ($336M) are in these two areas
alone. Note that overall, these 10 categories constitute 65% of the company&rsquo;s total
spend. Further analysis shows that rebate fulfillment only has eight suppliers, although

<p>advertising has close to 2,400! Clearly, by reducing the number of suppliers in the ad-
vertising sector, spend volumes can be leveraged and more favorable pricing can be
achieved, leading to a significant cost savings (perhaps on the order of 5&ndash;10%), which
could lead to a net bottom line contribution of between $17M and $33M!
</p>
<p>The same logic applies to general contracting, although the size of this opportu-
nity is not as great. With close to 500 suppliers of this service, and the third highest
spend ($175M), further negotiation and supply base reduction could lead to addi-
tional savings of $8&ndash;$17M. Combined, these two initiatives alone could contribute up
to $50M of net savings to this enterprise, which could either be utilized in other in-
vestments, or passed on to shareholders in the form of increased profitability and
shareholder value.
</p>
<p>Not bad for a day&rsquo;s work!
</p>
<p>From this analysis, the supply management team might approach the senior leader-
ship team and ask for resources to deploy two category management teams: one in
the rebate fulfillment services area, and another in the advertising sector. If approved,
the deliverables might be, say, a 5% savings on current spend in these two areas.
</p>
<p>Sourcing
Snapshot
</p>
<p>Shipping Shortages Drive
Raw Material Costs
</p>
<p>Category strategies do not just focus on commodities and goods, but also on services
such as transportation. For many commodities, raw material costs are increasingly being
driven by the cost of shipping. The cost of shipping raw materials across the world&rsquo;s oceans
has reached an all-time high in October 2007, pushing up prices of grain, iron ore, coal,
and other commodities. The average price of renting a ship to carry raw materials from Bra-
zil to China has nearly tripled to $180,000 from $65,000 a year ago. In some cases, ocean
shipping can be more expensive than the cargo itself. Iron ore, for example, costs about $60
a ton, but ship owners are charging about $88 a ton to carry it from Brazil to Asia. The
trend is forcing many manufacturers to pay more for basic ingredients, which will probably
be passed on to consumers, affecting everything from automobiles to washing machines and
bread. The main reason for these shipping rates escalating is that there are not enough bulk
ships. The shortage is related to the fact that explosive growth in China, India, and other de-
veloping nations is driving a need for importing of raw materials, such as iron ore from Bra-
zil. Experts believe that shipping rates are not through escalating, either. New batches of
bulk freighters are not expected to come online until 2010. &ldquo;All of the ship owners are mak-
ing a lot of money because these are numbers the market has never seen,&rdquo; said John P. Drag-
nis, commercial director of Goldenport Inc., one of the largest providers of ships to
commodity sellers. And even when ships are available, bottlenecks at port facilities can
cause delays, driving up the costs of shipments. At many ports in Brazil, Australia, and else-
where, wait times have increased by 35%. The Baltic Exchange Dry Index, which reflects
rates to transport bulk commodities such as coal, iron ore, and grains in vessels of typical
sizes, is up from 4000 in October of 2006 to 11,000 in October 2007. Don&rsquo;t expect it to go
away soon, as Chinese and Indian manufacturers tie up more ships in their hunger for more
raw materials to drive their economies.

<p>202 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Category Strategy Development (Strategic Sourcing)
Once the decision has been made to outsource a product or service, firms will
</p>
<p>typically use a process known as strategic sourcing to decide to whom to outsource
the product or service, as well as the structure and type of relationship that should
be established. A sourcing strategy is typically focused on a category of products or
services, and for that reason, the strategy is sometimes called a category strategy. A
category strategy is a decision process used to identify which suppliers should pro-
vide a group of products or services, the form of the contract, the performance
measures used to measure supplier performance, and the appropriate level of price,
quality, and delivery arrangements that should be negotiated. A typical category
may include many smaller subcategories. For example, a category around informa-
tion technology may include subcategories such as laptops, desktops, servers, and
keyboards. If a firm outsources accounting services, the category strategy may in-
clude tax accountants and managerial accountants. The strategic sourcing decision is
typically made by a cross-functional team, composed of sourcing professionals, op-
erations managers, finance, or other stakeholders for the product or service. A stake-
holder is someone who is impacted by the sourcing decision. They have a stake in
the game, so to speak, so their input in the sourcing decision is critical to reaching
a successful sourcing decision. The sourcing process is described below and is
shown in Exhibit 6.9.

<p>Step 1: Build the Team and the Project Charter
Companies are increasingly using a team approach to sourcing decision making
</p>
<p>by bringing together personnel from multiple functions who are familiar with the
product to be purchased. Part of the first phase of the category management process
is to identify the people who should be involved, as well as the key subject matter ex-
perts who may be part of the extended team. Once developed, the team should then
define the scope of the category strategy, publish a project charter, and develop a
work plan and communication plan. These steps help to define the purpose, bound-
aries, and goals of the process; identify the tasks involved; and provide a plan for com-
municating the results to the primary stakeholders.
</p>
<p>A category team can be composed of personnel from operations, product design,
process engineering, marketing, finance, and purchasing. The personnel involved
should be familiar with the commodity being evaluated. For instance, if the team is
tasked with purchasing computers, then users from information systems should be in-
cluded. If the team purchases vehicles and vehicle parts, then it would be a good idea
to include maintenance managers who are familiar with the characteristics of these
commodities. In general, the more important the commodity, the more likely that
cross-functional members and user groups will be involved. Together, the commodity
team will develop a commodity strategy that provides the specific details and outlines
the actions to follow in managing the commodity. Strong skills in team building and
leadership, decision making, influencing internal users and suppliers, and compromis-
ing in reaching a team consensus are therefore critical skills found in individuals who
will succeed in these roles.
</p>
<p>Every sourcing team should begin by assigning a project lead, who will coordinate
meetings, project deliverables, and requirements. The project lead will assemble a
group of subject matter experts from various stakeholder groups in the team to pro-
vide feedback and assist with delivering the project charter. The project charter is a
clear statement of the goals and objectives of the sourcing project, which is officially
announced shortly after the team&rsquo;s first few meetings. The project charter can be is-
sued before or after the cross-functional sourcing team has been formed, and in fact,
it can be used to garner interest from potential participants in the process. The pur-
pose of a project charter is to demonstrate management support for the project and
its manager.
</p>
<p>Step 2: Conduct Market Research on Suppliers
The second step when developing a sourcing strategy is to fully understand the pur-
</p>
<p>chase requirement relative to the business unit objectives. Also involved in this step
is a thorough supplier spend analysis to determine past expenditures for each com-
modity and supplier, as well as the total expenditures for the commodity as a percent-
age of the total. Note that the spend analysis identified in the prior section looked at
spending for the entire company. A category spend analysis will drill down to a more
granular level and identify the specific business units that are purchasing the prod-
ucts or services, and which suppliers they are currently using. Generally, this pro-
duces a Pareto chart as shown before; often one or a handful of suppliers are the
primary sources of the majority of spending in a particular category. After understand-
ing the spend, the category team should also educate themselves as to what is happen-
ing in the marketplace, as well as what their internal customer requirements are. Just
as you would perform research before buying a car (e.g., going online, reading re-
views of vehicles, looking into gas mileage, and looking at warranty history reports at

<p/>

<p>Consumer Reports), teams perform the same type of market research on the supply
base. This is critical in building and understanding the key suppliers, their capabili-
ties, and their capacity to perform and meet the stakeholders&rsquo; requirements.
</p>
<p>To make an informed decision about sourcing, several pieces of information are
needed. These include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Information on total annual purchase volumes. This is often an important
element from the spend analysis. This analysis should show how much was
spent on the category of goods or services by supplier, by business unit, and
by subgroups.
</p>
<p>&bull; Interviews with stakeholders to determine their forecasted requirements. For
example, if the annual purchase volume last year was $10 million, is this
figure expected to go up or down next year based on the predicted amount
of work? Stakeholders should also be interviewed to determine any new
sourcing elements that may not have been included in last year&rsquo;s figure.
</p>
<p>&bull; External market research identifying information on key suppliers, available
capacity, technology trends, price and cost data and trends, technical require-
ments, environmental and regulatory issues, and any other data that is avail-
able. In effect the team must educate themselves through a detailed analysis
of the marketplace and identify how best to meet the forecasted demand
(generated by the spend analysis and interviews with stakeholders) given the
market conditions that will occur in the next year.
</p>
<p>The data can be collected in a number of ways. For example, the team might elect to
meet with a supplier that is an expert on the marketplace, or an external consultant
who specializes in studying certain markets (e.g., chemicals, resins, IT providers).
These interviews are often the best source of information and are not published. Sec-
ondary data sources are published available databases, reports, websites, and so on. Ex-
amples might be a &ldquo;state of the industry&rdquo; report purchased from a consulting
company or a publicly available database such as the Census of U.S. Manufacturers
or the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics. The problem with secondary data such as
these is that they are often outdated and may not provide the specific information
the team is looking for.
</p>
<p>When conducting market research, the team may use an outsourced provider
such as Beroe (www.beroe-inc.com), ICE, or Global Outlook. However the data are
collected, the team must also process and integrate the data to ensure that they are
relevant and can be effectively communicated to stakeholders. The whole point of con-
ducting market research is to understand the prevailing market conditions and the
ability of current or potential new suppliers to effectively deliver the product or ser-
vice. In that respect, supply market intelligence becomes one of the most important
and critical stepping stones for an effective category strategy. As one manager noted,
&ldquo;Supply market intelligence may be the only competitive advantage of the future!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Where do most firms go to find good market intelligence? There are multiple
sources of market and supplier information available. The key here is to triangulate,
which means that you need to explore, compare, and contrast data from multiple
sources before you can validate it. Triangulation is part of the scientific method and
requires that you establish corroborating data to validate a given hypothesis. The
more data points you have supporting the hypothesis, the greater the likelihood that
the hypothesis is correct. Your job is to go through these sources and identify key
elements that support your hypothesis.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Trade journals are a great place to start. These journals provide good leads
and recent updates to what is happening in the industry.
</p>
<p>&bull; Start also with annual reports for supplier companies, as well as other custo-
mers, and make sure you read the notes to investors.
</p>
<p>&bull; The Internet is great and provides a ton of leads.
</p>
<p>&bull; Don&rsquo;t forget the power of books. Many people just start by using Google,
which leads you to a massive set of links that may or may not be useful. A
visit to a university library can lead you to some great reference books and
trade journals, with multiple leads for further information.
</p>
<p>&bull; The power of snowball sampling is important. This means finding experts in a par-
ticular category, who can refer you to other experts whom you can also talk to.
</p>
<p>&bull; There are trade consultants who can provide information, but they are very
often costly.
</p>
<p>&bull; Category managers will also visit trade association conferences and trade
websites. These conferences offer a great opportunity to network and learn
more from other people who know a lot about what is going on in the
industry.
</p>
<p>&bull; You&rsquo;ve got to be scanning the headlines.
</p>
<p>&bull; Suppliers are about the best sources. Don&rsquo;t just talk to salespeople. Talk to
the line and their purchasing people.
</p>
<p>&bull; Investment analyst reports, as well as interviews, can provide very good infor-
mation on what is happening in certain industries where they are investing.
</p>
<p>Collecting the data is just the first part of the job. To effectively represent and commu-
nicate the market conditions, category teams may employ a number of different data
representation tools to portray and explain the current situation. Three tools we will
discuss here are Porter Five Forces analysis, SWOT analysis, and supplier analysis.
</p>
<p>Porter Five Forces
Porter Five Forces was created to describe competitive forces in a market econ-
</p>
<p>omy. Porter Five Forces is a heavy-hitting strategy development tool that is used
widely for business strategy development and sales and marketing strategies. The five
forces are the forces that shape an industry (see Exhibit 6.10).
</p>
<p>Michael Porter&rsquo;s industry analysis methodology was introduced in his book Com-
petitive Strategy, first published in 1980 and now in its 60th printing. The powerful
tool provides understanding of an industry with a simple framework.
</p>
<p>Data for creation of a Five Forces analysis requires a review of all of the different
data sources described to date in this section. It may also involve deep market intelli-
gence through focused discussions with key stakeholders and subject matter experts.
The tool helps to predict supplier and buyer behavior in the marketplace and is a criti-
cal element in shaping supply strategy. Five Forces analysis is close to a crystal ball
and can be used to predict the future. It is also a helpful educational tool to lead stake-
holders to understand current supply market conditions. When you understand your
supplier&rsquo;s needs, you can figure out how you can help them help you.

<p>The following are the five forces:
</p>
<p>1. Higher levels of competition create more options for buyers and suppliers. Fac-
tors include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Speed of industry growth
</p>
<p>&bull; Capacity utilization
</p>
<p>&bull; Exit barriers
</p>
<p>&bull; Product differences
</p>
<p>&bull; Switching costs
</p>
<p>&bull; Diversity of competitors
</p>
<p>2. The threat of new entrants. Examples here might be the new set of Chinese
and other low-cost-country manufacturers that are entering many of the tradi-
tional U.S. manufacturing strongholds such as electronics and automobiles.
Factors include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Capital markets
</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of skilled workers
</p>
<p>&bull; Access to critical technologies, inputs, or distribution
</p>
<p>&bull; Product life cycles

<p>&bull; Brand equity/customer loyalty
</p>
<p>&bull; Government deregulation
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk of switching
</p>
<p>&bull; Economies of scale
</p>
<p>3. The threat of substitute products and services. For example, there are a new
set of growing composites, thermosets, and carbon fibers that are replacing tra-
ditional elements such as steel. Factors influencing this include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Relative performance of substitutes
</p>
<p>&bull; Relative price of substitutes
</p>
<p>&bull; Switching costs
</p>
<p>&bull; Buyer propensity to substitute
</p>
<p>4. The power of buyers. For example, as buyers begin to consolidate specifica-
tions and develop industry standards, increasing power is created over suppli-
ers in the marketplace. Factors include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Buyer concentration
</p>
<p>&bull; Buyer volume
</p>
<p>&bull; Buyer switching costs
</p>
<p>&bull; Price sensitivity
</p>
<p>&bull; Product differences
</p>
<p>&bull; Brand identity
</p>
<p>&bull; Impact on quality or performance
</p>
<p>&bull; Buyer profits
</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of substitutes
</p>
<p>5. The power of suppliers. As many supply markets begin to consolidate, fewer
suppliers means that a greater amount of supplier power exists in markets. Fac-
tors include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Prices of major inputs
</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to pass on price increases
</p>
<p>&bull; Availability of key technologies or other resources
</p>
<p>&bull; Threat of forward or backward integration
</p>
<p>&bull; Industry capacity utilization
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier concentration
</p>
<p>&bull; Importance of volume to supplier
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, summarizing these elements requires that participants take a
high-level view of the marketplace and begin to brainstorm and review the implica-
tions of these changes in the marketplace.
</p>
<p>SWOT Analysis
An analysis that examines strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
</p>
<p>(SWOT) can provide insight even with limited data. (It is often a good way to figure
out what data you have and where there are gaps.) As a strategic planning tool, the
goal is to minimize weakness and threats, and exploit strengths and opportunities
(see Exhibit 6.11).

<p>Supplier Analysis
</p>
<p>Establish Benchmarks through Industry Databases
Benchmarking is an important element in building competitive strategy. Bench-
</p>
<p>marking requires identifying the critical performance criteria that are being bench-
marked and identifying relative competitive performance. Industry benchmarks
involve comparisons of performance with firms in the same industry, whereas exter-
nal benchmarks involve best practices and performance levels achieved by firms that
are not within the same industry.
</p>
<p>The Center for Advanced Supply Management Studies has a number of supply man-
agement benchmark reports that can provide comparative insights into supply manage-
ment performance. A number of reports on various components of supply strategy can
also be found through consulting organizations, such as Aberdeen Group, Gartner, Pro-
curement Strategy Council, Hackett Group, and other firms.
</p>
<p>Requests for Information
A request for information (RFI) is generally used before a specific requisition of
</p>
<p>an item is issued. Most organizations will issue an RFI if they have determined that
there are several potential suppliers. The RFI is a solicitation document that is used
by organizations to obtain general information about services, products, or suppliers.
This document does not constitute a binding agreement by either the supplier or the
purchaser. The information gathered from an RFI can be disseminated throughout
the organization or to specific departments.
</p>
<p>This procedure is generally used when a large or complicated purchase is being
considered and the potential pool of suppliers must be prequalified. In this case an

<p>RFI is a questionnaire or inquiry into the supplier&rsquo;s background. This is used to deter-
mine if the supplier meets the minimum standards needed to successfully bid on the
project and, if awarded, successfully complete the project
</p>
<p>Value Chain Analysis
Value chain analysis is used to help identify the cost savings opportunities that
</p>
<p>exist within the supply chain. The goal is to be able to understand, identify, and ex-
ploit cost savings opportunities that may have been overlooked by business unit man-
agers or even by suppliers in bringing the products and services to the appropriate
location.
</p>
<p>Some of the best data for value chain analysis comes from books, industry jour-
nals, and discussions with suppliers. The tool provides insights into where products
originate (from dirt) and where they end up (cradle to grave). A good value chain
analysis can provide insights into where in the market you need to be buying. Ex-
amples of value chain analysis are discussed in Chapter 12.
</p>
<p>Supplier Research
Supplier research is required to identify the specific capabilities and financial
</p>
<p>health of key suppliers that are in the supply base or that may not currently be in
the supply base. Some of the key elements that should be documented and included
in a comprehensive supplier analysis study include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost structure
</p>
<p>&bull; Financial status
</p>
<p>&bull; Customer satisfaction levels
</p>
<p>&bull; Support capabilities
</p>
<p>&bull; Relative strengths and weakness
</p>
<p>&bull; How the buying company fits in their business
</p>
<p>&bull; How the company is viewed
</p>
<p>&bull; Core capabilities
</p>
<p>&bull; Strategy/future direction
</p>
<p>&bull; Culture
</p>
<p>Identifying the major suppliers in a market is an important first step of any supplier
analysis, especially when you are talking about global market share. This tells you
who the world prefers, who the world is buying from! It is also critical to understand
global capacity versus global demand and trends.
</p>
<p>Step 3: Strategy Development
Once the team have educated themselves to the point that they feel they know
</p>
<p>enough about the supply market conditions, the forecasted spend, and the user stake-
holder requirements, they are faced with a different challenge. The team must con-
vert all of this data into meaningful knowledge and apply some meaningful tools to
structure the information so that it will render an effective decision. Two tools are
most often used in this process: a portfolio analysis matrix (sometimes called the stra-
tegic sourcing matrix), and the supplier evaluation scorecard.S

<p>Portfolio Analysis
Portfolio analysis is a tool to structure and segment the supply base, and is used
</p>
<p>as a means of classifying suppliers into one of four types. The objective is to catego-
rize every purchase or family of purchases into one of four categories. The premise
of portfolio analysis is that every purchase or family of purchases can be classified
into one of four categories or quadrants: (1) Critical, (2) Routine, (3) Leverage, and
(4) Bottleneck.3 By effectively classifying the goods and services being purchased into
one of these categories, those responsible for proposing a strategy are able to compre-
hend the strategic importance of the item to the business. The results of this analysis
can then be compared to the current sourcing strategy for the category group, and tac-
tics and actions defined for moving forward. Exhibit 6.12 on p. 211 summarizes the es-
sential elements of strategy, tactics, and actions associated with managing categories
that fall into each of the different quadrants in the matrix, and these are described in
greater detail below.
</p>
<p>Critical Commodity&mdash;Strategic Supplier
Generally speaking, the goals for a strategic commodity are to develop a competi-
</p>
<p>tive advantage, support and leverage the supplier&rsquo;s core competencies, develop best-
in-class suppliers, support the company&rsquo;s overall strategy, and improve value-added
services beyond a simple purchasing agreement. If the annual spend on the item is
high, then it also makes sense for the company to establish a strategic preferred sup-
plier. A preferred supplier designation indicates that the selected supplier should re-
ceive the business under most conditions. Formally designating a supplier as strategic
builds a foundation for achieving higher levels of information sharing and improve-
ment. In the words of Dave Nelson, a guru in supply management who has worked
at Honda, John Deere, and Delphi, &ldquo;If you develop the right relationship with your
supply base, you can have 10,000 additional brains thinking about ways to improve
your product and generate cost savings. And that is very powerful!&rdquo;4
</p>
<p>Routine Commodity
Products and services in this category are readily available and often are low in
</p>
<p>cost. Examples include janitorial services, facilities management, and office suppliers.
The goal for the team is to reduce the number of items in this category through substi-
tution, elimination of small-volume spend, elimination of duplicate SKUs, rationaliza-
tion of the number of units to control costs, and simplification of the procurement
process using electronic tools (e.g., electronic data interchange, auto-order systems,
online vendor catalogs, and purchasing cards). For example, at GlaxoSmithKline, a
pharmaceutical company, the chief procurement officer discovered that the R&amp;D
group was using 50 different types of Bunsen burners and beakers simply because sci-
entists have particular preferences that they acquired in graduate school.
</p>
<p>The team will also try to find suppliers that can automate the purchasing process
to the greatest extent possible. For example, companies such as Staples and Office-
Depot will consolidate a company&rsquo;s purchases of paper and office supplies, and en-
able users to order supplies directly from their online catalog. A supplier catalog
allows users to order directly through the Internet using a company procurement
card (just like a credit card), with the delivery made directly to the site the next day.

<p>212 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Leverage Commodity&mdash;Preferred Supplier
As in the case of a common commodity, a leverage commodity also provides the
</p>
<p>opportunity for savings. These items or services have a high volume of internal con-
sumption, are readily available, are important to the business, and represent a signifi-
cant portion of spend. Because of their importance to the business, the need to
maintain a high level of quality and compliance with corporate objectives is para-
mount. Preferred suppliers are awarded the business under these conditions with the
understanding that they will be expected to significantly reduce the cost of supplying
these items or services over time, in return for a significant volume of business and
possible multiyear agreements. A high level of service is also expected, which may in-
clude supplier capabilities such as management of on-site inventory, e-purchasing ca-
pabilities, and ability to quickly respond to customer requirements. In so doing, the
supplier will also be expected to maintain a high level of quality and to reduce the to-
tal cost to the business of managing this commodity.
</p>
<p>One of the tools often used for this category of spend is an e-reverse auction
(e-RA), an online auction that awards the business to the lowest bidder (as opposed
to the highest bidder, as in a traditional auction, hence the terminology &ldquo;reverse
auction&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Bottleneck Commodity&mdash;Transactional Supplier
The final combination often found in developing sourcing strategy is for bottle-
</p>
<p>neck commodities, which have unique requirements or niche suppliers yet are signifi-
cant to the business. Such items tend to be expensive, due to the exclusive market
position maintained by the supplier. The goal of the team is to not run out and to en-
sure continuity of supply. In such cases, an optimal strategy might be to scan the mar-
ketplace and develop an agreement with a supplier to enable a streamlined accounts
payable and receiving process. If the supplier is relatively small, this may involve send-
ing an IT team to establish this capability at the supplier&rsquo;s location, with some mini-
mal technology investment required. After a competitive bid, a detailed negotiation
should take place that establishes high levels of service as critical to the business,
with specific service level agreements detailed. The supplier must be validated to en-
sure that it can deliver in a responsive manner, is capable of handling orders from
multiple locations, and is responsible for managing inventory of the item. In service
agreements, the supplier must be led to understand the specific requirements around
providing the service.
</p>
<p>Supplier Evaluation
Once the portfolio analysis is completed, the team must then dive into the cate-
</p>
<p>gory and evaluate individual suppliers as to their suitability, narrowing the list down
to a critical few. The ultimate result of this step is to make supplier recommen-
dations, so the team must first identify current and potential suppliers, determine
any information technology requirements, and identify opportunities to leverage the
commodity expenditures with similar commodities.
</p>
<p>Some of the criteria used to evaluate suppliers, as well as the tools that can be
used to do so, are discussed in the next chapter, which describes weighted point sup-
plier evaluation systems. Here we limit ourselves to a brief description of the differ-
ent criteria that a company may use to assess potential suppliers, which include the
following capabilities:

</p>
<p>These criteria are worth talking about in more detail. Although it may not be possi-
ble to obtain all the relevant information, data that can be obtained will help the buy-
ing firm assess the potential for a successful match.
</p>
<p>Process and Design Capabilities
Because different manufacturing and service processes have various strengths and
</p>
<p>weaknesses, the buying firm must be aware of these characteristics upfront. When
the buying firm expects suppliers to perform component design and production, it
should also assess the supplier&rsquo;s design capability. One way to reduce the time re-
quired to develop new products is to use qualified suppliers that are able to perform
product design activities.
</p>
<p>Management Capability
Assessing a potential supplier&rsquo;s management capability is a complicated, but impor-
</p>
<p>tant, step. Different aspects of management capability include management&rsquo;s commit-
ment to continuous process and quality improvement, its overall professional ability
and experience, its ability to maintain positive relationships with its workforce, and
its willingness to develop a closer working relationship with the buyer.
</p>
<p>Financial Condition and Cost Structure
An assessment of a potential partner&rsquo;s financial condition usually occurs during
</p>
<p>the evaluation process. Evaluation teams will typically evaluate the different financial
ratios that determine whether a supplier can invest in resources, pay its suppliers and
its workforce, and continue to meet its debt and financial obligations. These elements
are important in determining whether the supplier will continue to be a reliable
source of supply, and that supply will not be disrupted.
</p>
<p>Planning and Control Systems
Planning and control systems include those systems that release, schedule, and con-
</p>
<p>trol the flow of work in an organization. As we shall see in later chapters, the sophisti-
cation of such systems can have a major impact on supply chain performance.
</p>
<p>Environmental Regulation Compliance
The 1990s brought about a renewed awareness of the impact that industry has on
</p>
<p>the environment. The Clean Air Act of 1990 imposes large fines on producers of
ozone-depleting substances and foul-smelling gases, and governments have intro-
duced laws regarding recycling content in industrial materials. As a result, a suppli-
er&rsquo;s ability to comply with environmental regulations is becoming an important
criterion for supply chain alliances. This includes, but is not limited to, the proper dis-
posal of hazardous waste. (This is discussed in a later chapter.)

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Longer-Term Relationship Potential
In some cases, a firm may be looking to develop a long-term relationship with a po-
</p>
<p>tential supplier. This is particularly true if the supplier is in the &ldquo;Critical&rdquo; quadrant,
and the category of spend is high volume and critical to the company&rsquo;s business.
This approach requires that the parties share their mutual goals, establish metrics to
guide the relationship, and develop a series of ongoing discussions on how issues and
conflicts can be resolved in a mutually beneficial manner. These relationships may
also involve joint cost-savings projects and new-product development efforts, which
are also described in a later chapter on integration.
</p>
<p>This is not a complete list of criteria that can be applied when evaluating the possi-
bility of a closer, longer-term relationship. This list does provide, however, a frame-
work concerning the types of issues that are important in this area.
</p>
<p>Supplier Selection Scorecards
During the selection stage, oftentimes companies need a structured way to evalu-
</p>
<p>ate alternative suppliers. This can be particularly hard when the criteria include not
just quantitative measures (such as costs and on-time delivery rates), but other, more
qualitative factors, such as management stability or trustworthiness. A supplier selec-
tion scorecard may be used as a decision support tool. The team will assign a weight
to the different categories and develop a numerical score for each supplier in each cat-
egory, thereby developing a final performance score.
</p>
<p>The need for assessment does not end with the selection decision, however. After
the buyer-supplier relationship has been established, buyers also must track supplier
performance over time. The ability to rank suppliers across multiple criteria can be es-
pecially helpful in identifying which suppliers are providing superior performance,
and which are in need of some work.
</p>
<p>After making the selection using some of the different supplier evaluation tools,
the team must reach consensus on the strategy. The team may even take the suppli-
ers short list and hold meetings with the selected suppliers to enable an effective deci-
sion. Finally, the suppliers are chosen that best fit the commodity strategy to be
employed, based on their performance in the supplier analysis.
</p>
<p>Step 4: Contract Negotiation
After the sourcing strategy has been determined and suppliers have been rec-
</p>
<p>ommended, it is time to implement the strategy and negotiate the contract. Effective
implementation of the strategy includes establishing tasks and time lines, assigning
accountabilities and process ownership, and ensuring adequate resources are made
available to the process owners. The strategy should also be communicated to all
stakeholders, including suppliers and internal customers, in order to obtain buy-in
and participation.
</p>
<p>Before entering into contract negotiations, the commodity team should perform
an analysis of market and pricing issues so that a fair price for both parties can be
agreed upon. This analysis attempts to define the marketplace, including best price, av-
erage price, and the business unit&rsquo;s price, and determines expected trends in pricing.
In preparation for negotiations, the buyer should develop a negotiation plan and an
ideal contract. There should also be a contingency plan in case negotiations with the
recommended suppliers do not go as expected. Finally, the negotiation is conducted,
and a contract is signed.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>For some items, firms may maintain a list of preferred suppliers that receive the
first opportunity for new business. A preferred supplier has demonstrated its perfor-
mance capabilities through previous purchase contracts and, therefore, receives prefer-
ence during the supplier selection process. By maintaining a preferred supplier list,
purchasing personnel can quickly identify suppliers with proven performance capabili-
ties. Competitive bidding and negotiation are two methods commonly used for final
supplier selection when there is not a preferred supplier.
</p>
<p>Competitive Bidding
Competitive bidding in private industry entails a request for bids from suppliers
</p>
<p>with whom the buyer is willing to do business. This process is typically initiated
when the purchasing manager sends a request for quotation (RFQ) to qualified suppli-
ers. The RFQ is a formal request for the suppliers to prepare bids, based on the
terms and conditions set by the buyer. Purchasers often evaluate the resulting bids
based on price. If the lowest bidder does not receive the purchase contract, the buyer
has an obligation to inform that supplier why it did not receive the contract. Competi-
tive bidding is most effective when the following conditions apply:5
</p>
<p>&bull; The buying firm can provide qualified suppliers with clear descriptions of
the items or services to be purchased.
</p>
<p>&bull; Volume is high enough to justify the cost and effort.
</p>
<p>&bull; The firm does not have a preferred supplier.
</p>
<p>Buying firms use competitive bidding when price is a dominant criterion and the re-
quired items or services have straightforward specifications. In addition, government
agencies often require competitive bidding. If there are major nonprice variables,
then the buyer and seller usually enter into direct negotiation. Competitive bidding
can also be used to identify a short list of suppliers with whom the firm will begin de-
tailed purchase contract negotiation.
</p>
<p>More advanced online tools are becoming available that feature the ability to nego-
tiate issues beyond price with multiple suppliers. With these tools, e-procurement
managers no longer have to spend hours in face-to-face meetings arguing over details
with suppliers. A buyer simply fills out an RFQ template and forwards the document
electronically to suppliers.6 Suppliers can respond electronically with online proposals
detailing price, payment terms, shipping methods, or any other issue relevant to the
buyer. These tools enable a buyer to negotiate the process simultaneously with more
than one supplier, which leads to efficiencies and lower prices due to increased compe-
tition (similar to reverse auctions).
</p>
<p>Negotiation
Negotiation is a more costly, interactive approach to final supplier selection. Face-
</p>
<p>to-face negotiation is best when the following conditions apply:
</p>
<p>&bull; The item is a new or technically complex item with only vague
specifications.
</p>
<p>&bull; The purchase requires agreement about a wide range of performance
factors.
</p>
<p>&bull; The buyer requires the supplier to participate in the development effort.
</p>
<p>&bull; The supplier cannot determine risks and costs without additional input
from the buyer.

<p>216 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Negotiations with a supplier should occur only when a purchaser feels confident
about the level of planning and preparation put forth. However, planning is not an
open-ended process; buyers must usually meet deadlines that satisfy the needs of inter-
nal customers within the purchaser&rsquo;s firm. Thus, the buyer faces pressure to conduct
the negotiation within a reasonable amount of time.
</p>
<p>Step 5: Supplier Relationship Management
The strategic sourcing process does not end when a contract is signed with a sup-
</p>
<p>plier. Although the sourcing team may disband and go their separate ways once the
contract is signed, typically one member of the team will continue to work with the
supplier in the role of supplier relationship manager. This individual must continu-
ously monitor the performance of the sourcing strategy, as well as the supplier. The
buying firm should revisit the sourcing strategy at predetermined intervals, to ensure
that it is achieving its stated objectives, and may need to make modifications to the
strategy if it is not working as planned or if there are changes in the market. The
buying firm should also continuously monitor the performance of suppliers based on
predetermined and agreed-upon criteria such as quality, delivery performance, and
continuous cost improvement. And there should be a plan in place to manage any
conflicts that occur with suppliers.
</p>
<p>One of the most important tools used to monitor supplier performance is the sup-
plier scorecard. Just like the supplier evaluation matrix, the scorecard often reflects
the same set of categories used during the evaluation process, but the scores are up-
dated typically once a quarter, and reviewed with the supplier. Over time, the nature
of the classifications used in the scorecard may also change, as the stakeholders&rsquo; re-
quirements and their requests may change. Scorecards typically include the categories
of price, quality, and delivery reliability used in the evaluation process, but the team
may also choose to add categories such as &ldquo;Responsiveness&rdquo; (how quickly does the
supplier return a call when there is a problem?). These scorecards are used in regu-
larly scheduled review meetings with suppliers, so that deficiencies in performance
can be noted, discussed, and acted upon.
</p>
<p>Regular reviews must be held to determine if the strategy is successful or whether
it requires modification. The review may include feedback and input from key suppli-
ers. In any case, all suppliers should be advised of results along with future expecta-
tions. Supply management personnel play a key role in this review because they are
often the primary contact for the supplier with responsibility for supplier perfor-
mance measurement. Earlier decisions may have to be revisited and re-evaluated if
suppliers do not perform as expected.
</p>
<p>The key goals defined in Step 2 must be revisited periodically to identify modifica-
tions to the original strategy. Key elements of the results-monitoring process include
the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct regular review meetings (at least annually) to determine if the strat-
egy is well aligned with an organization&rsquo;s objectives.
</p>
<p>&bull; Share results with top management to provide additional momentum to the
strategy; be sure to report the performance improvements achieved through
the strategy.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Assess internal customers&rsquo; and suppliers&rsquo; perceptions. Are they satisfied with
what has happened? If not, why not, and can the strategy be altered to im-
prove the situation?
</p>
<p>&bull; Determine whether key goals are being achieved. If they are not being
achieved, what is the contingency plan? If the goals are being achieved, are
there any lessons to be learned?
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide feedback to those involved.
</p>
<p>These strategy development steps are relatively general&mdash;they describe the steps to fol-
low only when proposing and executing a strategy. However, the actual outcomes of
the commodity strategy development process may vary considerably, depending on
the specific commodity and the supply market.
</p>
<p>Types of Supply Management Strategies
Organizations can employ a variety of different strategies that may be unique to
</p>
<p>each commodity. Although we cannot cover all of the possible variations of strategies
that may emerge, we will briefly review some of the most common and important sup-
ply management strategies. As we will see later, certain strategies are used more often
than others, depending on how advanced an organization is at the supply manage-
ment strategy development process. Each of these strategies or supply management
approaches is covered in greater detail in other chapters throughout the book.
</p>
<p>Supply Base Optimization
Supply base optimization is the process of determining the appropriate number and
</p>
<p>mix of suppliers to maintain. Although this has also been referred to as rightsizing, it
usually refers to reducing the number of suppliers used. Moreover, suppliers that are
not capable of achieving world-class performance, either currently or in the near fu-
ture, may be eliminated from the supply base. This process is continuous because the
needs of the business unit are always changing. Optimization requires an analysis of
the number of suppliers required currently and in the future for each purchased
item. For example, General Motors was ready to eliminate 160 suppliers worldwide
that it considered poor performers in 2003 and 2004. Chapter 9 discusses supply
base optimization in detail.
</p>
<p>Supply Risk Management
Events in 2005 such as Hurricane Katrina and corresponding escalating commod-
</p>
<p>ity prices have highlighted more than ever the impact of disruptions on supply chain
operations and global competition. Although many events are not easily predicted,
there are many other sources of supply chain disruption that have the potential to be
better managed, thereby reducing the impact on firm agility and profitability.
</p>
<p>As firms outsource a greater proportion of products and services from China, India,
and other low-cost countries, the hidden perils of these approaches are often not consid-
ered, especially within the context of enterprise risk management (ERM). Global out-
sourcing affords many benefits in the form of lower prices and expanded market
access, but only recently have senior executives begun to recognize the increased risk at-
tributed to the higher probability of product and service flow disruptions in global

<p>sourcing networks. A major disruption in the offshore supply chain can shut down a
company and have dire consequences for profitability. This was felt most drastically in
the last few years, when such events as 9/11, the war in Iraq, the West Coast port work-
ers&rsquo; strike, and increased regulatory and customs delays brought supply chain opera-
tions to a standstill. Recently, the impact of Hurricane Katrina was felt by companies
relying on supplies of critical commodities produced on the Gulf Coast such as fuel, nat-
ural gas, chemicals, and resins. Other, less serious events that can also impact customer
service include fire and theft, poor communication of customer requirements, part
shortages, and quality problems.
</p>
<p>The impact of supply chain disruptions, although difficult to quantify, can be
costly. A study investigated stock market reactions when firms publicly announced
that they were experiencing supply chain glitches or disruptions causing production
or shipping delays.7 Results of the study of 519 supply chain problem announce-
ments showed that stock market reactions decrease shareholder value by 10.28%. A
follow-up study assessed the effect 827 publicly announced disruptions had on long-
run stock price (one year before the disruption and two years after) and found a
mean abnormal return of nearly &minus;40% along with significant increases in equity
risk.8 Their results also showed that the majority of supply chain disruptions in-
volved parts shortages, lack of response to customer-requested changes, production
problems, ramp-up problems, and quality problems.
</p>
<p>Many recent events illustrate this phenomenon. For example, Boeing experienced
supplier delivery failure of two critical parts with an estimated loss to the company
of $2.6 billion. In 2002, less than 100 workers in the longshoremen&rsquo;s union strike dis-
rupted West Coast port operations. As a result, it took six months for some contain-
ers to be delivered and schedules to return to normal. Finally, Hurricane Katrina
resulted in billions of dollars of lost revenue to major retailers such as British Petro-
leum, Shell, Conoco Phillips, and Lyondell, as well as causing gasoline shortages in
many parts of the United States, resulting in lost economic activity. Given these and
other events, it is not surprising that supply chain disruptions have caught the atten-
tion of executives.
</p>
<p>In a survey of BusinessWeek Global 1000 companies, supply chain disruptions
were perceived to be the single biggest threat to their companies&rsquo; revenue streams. Al-
though senior executives now recognize that supply chain disruptions can be devastat-
ing to an enterprise&rsquo;s bottom line, strategies to mitigate supply chain disruptions are
typically not well developed or even initiated. A troubling statistic is that only be-
tween 5 and 25% of Fortune 500 companies are estimated to be prepared to handle a
major supply chain crisis or disruption.
</p>
<p>One factor that is increasing the risk exposure to supply chain disruption is the
increasing propensity of companies to outsource processes to global suppliers. The
complexity associated with multiple hand-offs in global supply chains increases the
probability of disruptions. As the number of hand-offs required to ship products
through multiple carriers, multiple ports, and multiple government checkpoints in-
creases, so does the probability of poor communication, human error, and missed
shipments. One executive we interviewed from a major electronics company noted:
&ldquo;We have successfully outsourced production of our products to China. Unfortu-
nately, we now recognize that we do not have the processes in place to manage risk as-
sociated with this supply chain effectively!&rdquo;9 In this environment, questions arise
such as, What steps can an organization take to design its supply chains to ensure

<p>uninterrupted material availability? Is it possible to respond in an agile manner to cus-
tomer requirements in a global sourcing environment? These are issues that supply
chain managers must think through in the future, to build effective contingency
plans before these disruptions occur, so that there is a plan when they do occur.
</p>
<p>Global Sourcing
Global sourcing is an approach that requires supply management to view the en-
</p>
<p>tire world as a potential source for components, services, and finished goods. It can
be used to access new markets or to gain access to the same suppliers that are help-
ing global companies become more competitive. Although true global sourcing is
somewhat limited in most industries, more and more companies are beginning to
view the world as both a market and a source of supply.
</p>
<p>The major objective of global sourcing is to provide immediate and dramatic im-
provements in cost and quality as determined through the commodity research pro-
cess. Global sourcing is also an opportunity to gain exposure to product and process
technology, increase the number of available sources, satisfy countertrade require-
ments, and establish a presence in foreign markets. This strategy is not contradictory
to supply base optimization because it involves locating the worldwide best-in-class
suppliers for a given commodity. Some buyers also source globally to introduce com-
petition to domestic suppliers.
</p>
<p>There are several major barriers to global sourcing that must be overcome. Some
serious issues are that some firms are inexperienced with global business processes
and practices, and there are few personnel qualified to develop and negotiate with
global suppliers or manage long material pipelines. In addition, more complex logis-
tics and currency fluctuations require measuring all relevant costs before committing
to a worldwide source.
</p>
<p>Finally, organizations may not be prepared to deal with the different negotiating
styles practiced by different cultures, and they may have to work through a foreign
host national in order to establish contacts and an agreement. Chapter 10 addresses
global sourcing in detail.
</p>
<p>Longer-Term Supplier Relationships
Longer-term supplier relationships involve the selection of and continuous involve-
</p>
<p>ment with suppliers viewed as critical over an extended period of time (e.g., three
years and beyond). In general, the use of longer-term supplier relationships is grow-
ing in importance, and there will probably be greater pursuit of these relationships
through longer-term contracts. Some purchasers are familiar with the practice,
whereas for others it represents a radical departure from traditional short-term ap-
proaches to supply base management.
</p>
<p>Longer-term relationships are sought with suppliers that have exceptional perfor-
mance or unique technological expertise. Within the portfolio matrix described ear-
lier, this would involve the few suppliers that provide items and services that are
critical or of higher value. A longer-term relationship may include a joint product de-
velopment relationship with shared development costs and intellectual property. In
other cases, it may simply be an informal process of identifying suppliers that receive
preferential treatment. Chapter 14 discusses longer-term relationships and contracts.S

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Early Supplier Design Involvement
Early supplier design involvement and selection requires key suppliers to partici-
</p>
<p>pate at the concept or predesign stage of new-product development. Supplier involve-
ment may be informal, although the supplier may already have a purchase contract
for the production of an existing item. Early involvement will increasingly take place
through participation on cross-functional product development teams. This strategy
recognizes that qualified suppliers have more to offer than simply the basic produc-
tion of items that meet engineering specifications. Early supplier design involvement
is a simultaneous engineering approach that occurs between buyer and seller, and
seeks to maximize the benefits received by taking advantage of the supplier&rsquo;s design
capabilities. This strategy is discussed in detail in Chapter 4; the Good Practice Exam-
ple at the end of this chapter also highlights how one company has successfully
employed early involvement.
</p>
<p>Supplier Development
In some cases, purchasers may find that suppliers&rsquo; capabilities are not high
</p>
<p>enough to meet current or future expectations, yet they do not want to eliminate the
supplier from the supply base. (Switching costs may be high or the supplier has
performance potential.) A solution in such cases is to work directly with a supplier to
facilitate improvement in a designated functional or activity area. Buyer-seller consult-
ing teams working jointly may accelerate overall supplier improvement at a faster
rate than will actions taken independently by the supplier. The basic motivation be-
hind this strategy is that supplier improvement and success lead to longer-term bene-
fits to both buyer and seller. This approach supports the development of world-class
suppliers in new areas of product and process technology. Chapter 9 discusses sup-
plier development in detail.
</p>
<p>Total Cost of Ownership
Total cost of ownership (TCO) is the process of identifying cost considerations be-
</p>
<p>yond unit price, transport, and tooling. It requires the business unit to define and mea-
sure the various cost components associated with a purchased item. In many cases,
this includes costs associated with late delivery, poor quality, or other forms of sup-
plier nonperformance. Total cost of ownership can lead to better decision making be-
cause it identifies all costs associated with a supply management decision and the
costs associated with supplier nonperformance. Cost variances from planned results
can be analyzed to determine the cause of the variance. Corrective action can then pre-
vent further problems. TCO is discussed in detail in Chapters 10 and 11.
</p>
<p>E-Reverse Auctions
An e-RA is an online, real-time dynamic auction between a buying organi-
zation and a group of pre-qualified suppliers who compete against each
other to win the business to supply goods or services that have clearly de-
fined specifications for design, quantity, quality, delivery, and related terms
and conditions. These suppliers compete by bidding against each other on-
line over the Internet using specialized software by submitting successively
lower-priced bids during a scheduled time period. This time period is

<p>usually only about an hour, but multiple, brief extensions are usually al-
lowed if bidders are still active at the end of the initial time period.
</p>
<p>The use of e-RAs has been facilitated by a number of company internal and external
developments including the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Buyers&rsquo; and suppliers&rsquo; ability to communicate in real time, worldwide, via
the Internet.
</p>
<p>&bull; Development of robust, user-friendly Internet-based software systems to sup-
port worldwide e-RAs hosted by a third party or conducted by the buying
company with little or no outside assistance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Significant improvements in goods and service quality and cycle-time reduc-
tions have resulted in buying companies requiring superior quality and ser-
vice. Therefore, buyers have emphasized low price as a major sourcing-
decision variable.
</p>
<p>E-RAs are discussed in Chapter 13.

<p>Evolving Sourcing Strategies
If we compare the level of supply management strategy evolution to the strategies
</p>
<p>available, there is clearly an implementation sequence that emerges. Exhibit 6.13 pre-
sents the sequence of supply management strategy execution based on research from
multiple studies and interviews with many executives. Organizations tend to evolve

ment strategy development.

<p>Reverse Auctions
</p>
<p>Reverse auctions can be used for one specific product/service in a spot buy or for con-
tracts to provide the products or services over the course of a year. The goal of reverse auc-
tions is to bring buyers and sellers together to expose prices on a dynamic and real-time
basis. A reverse auction involves suppliers bidding on a clearly specified buyer requirement.
All activity takes place online. The majority of reverse auctions are completed in 30 minutes
or less (although some have been stretched out over 12 hours). A recent auction carried out
by a large engineering project construction firm for a large commodity group included multi-
ple suppliers from Japan, Korea, and the United States. The pricing behaviors that were evi-
denced in the auction stunned the buying company executives who witnessed them. The
price paid for the commodity was well below the group&rsquo;s expectation of market price. One ex-
ecutive who participated said, &ldquo;It showed us just how little we really knew about what the
market was doing.&rdquo; Reverse auctions can provide some deep insights into true market pric-
ing, especially in situations when there is available capacity in a supply marketplace.

<p>Phase 1: Basic Beginnings
In the initial stages of supply management strategy development, supply manage-
</p>
<p>ment is often characterized as a lower-level support function. Supply management
adopts essentially a short-term approach and reacts to complaints from its internal
customers when deliveries are late, quality is poor, or costs are too high. The only im-
petus for change here is the demand for change by management. The primary role of
supply management managers is to ensure that enough supply capacity exists, which
usually means that suppliers are viewed in an adversarial manner. However, the
amount of resources for improvement is limited, usually because the highest-ranking
supply management manager likely reports to manufacturing or materials manage-
ment. Performance measures focus on efficiency-related measures and price reduc-
tion. Information systems are location or facility focused and primarily transaction
based.
</p>
<p>In Phase 1, supply management often focuses on supply base optimization, and
more attention is paid to total quality management than to other progressive supply
management strategies. In a sense, these two strategies represent the building blocks
from which to pursue increasingly sophisticated strategies. A reduced supply base is
necessary because of the increased two-way communication and interaction neces-
sary for successful execution of more complicated strategies. TQM also provides the
fundamental focus on process that is required to implement supply management
strategies.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Phase 2: Moderate Development
The second phase of the strategy progression usually occurs as an organization be-
</p>
<p>gins to centrally coordinate or control some part of the supply management function
across regional or even worldwide locations. Supply management councils or lead
buyers may be responsible for entire classes of commodities, and companywide data-
bases by region may be developed to facilitate this coordination. The primary pur-
pose of this coordination is to establish companywide agreements in order to
leverage volumes to obtain lower costs from volume discounts. Single sourcing with
long-term agreements may eventually emerge as a policy for leveraged or consoli-
dated purchase families. At this stage, limited cross-functional integration is occur-
ring. In addition, e-RAs have recently been selectively used to leverage purchases and
improve goods and service pricing by between 15 and 30%.
</p>
<p>The approaches in Phases 1 and 2&mdash;supply base optimization, TQM, and long-
term contracting&mdash;have the potential, over time, to effect a steady increase in sup-
plier contributions and improvements, but the performance change rate may not be
dramatic.
</p>
<p>Purchasers must now begin to pursue strategic supplier relationships that focus on
customer needs and the organization&rsquo;s competitive strategy. In Phase 2, buyers may
begin to establish better relationships with critical suppliers while continuing to opti-
mize the supply base. The supply management department may now be evaluated on
the achievement of competitive objectives, and suppliers are viewed as a resource. As
such, there may be some informal channels of functional integration developing be-
tween supply management, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and accounting.
Some of this may occur through infrequent cross-functional team decision making.
The execution of supply management strategy still takes place primarily at the busi-
ness unit or local level.
</p>
<p>Phase 3: Limited Integration
A number of supply management initiatives discussed in this book, including con-
</p>
<p>current engineering, supplier development, lead-time reduction, and early supplier in-
volvement, characterize this phase. In this environment, supply management
strategies are established and integrated early into the product and process design
stage, and first- and second-tier suppliers are becoming actively involved in these deci-
sions. Supply management is evaluated on the basis of strategic contribution, and re-
sources are made available according to strategic requirements. Extensive functional
integration occurs through design and sourcing teams that focus on product develop-
ment, building a competitive advantage, and total cost analysis for new and existing
products and services. Supply management is viewed as a key part of the organiza-
tional structure with a strong external customer focus. As such, multiple customer-ori-
ented measurements are used to identify performance improvements. Information
systems include global databases, historical price and cost information, joint strategy
development efforts with other functional groups, and the beginning of total cost
modeling.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Phase 4: Fully Integrated Supply Chains
In the final and most advanced phase, supply management has assumed a strate-
</p>
<p>gic orientation, with reporting directly to executive management and a strong exter-
nal, rather than simply internal, customer focus. Non-value-added activities such as
purchase order follow-up and expediting have been automated, allowing purchasers
to focus their attention on strategic objectives and activities. Organizations demand a
higher performance standard from suppliers. Executives take aggressive actions that
will directly improve supplier capability and accelerate supplier performance
contributions.
</p>
<p>Examples of aggressive actions include developing global supplier capabilities, de-
veloping full-service suppliers, and adopting a systems thinking perspective that en-
compasses the entire supply chain. In such a mode, insourcing core activities add the
greatest value, whereas components of the value chain are often outsourced to up-
stream or downstream parties that are more capable.
</p>
<p>Such a system can directly affect the ability of the supply base to meet world-class
expectations and often involves direct intervention in the supplier&rsquo;s operating sys-
tems and processes.
</p>
<p>Relatively few organizations have evolved to this phase. However, for those that
succeed, a number of tangible and intangible benefits accrue from the progression of
supply management from a supportive role to an integrated activity. These include
price reductions across all product lines ranging from 5 to 25%; improved quality,
cost, and delivery performance in the range of 75 to 98% in six to eight months; and
a supply base that is better than the competition&rsquo;s. Supply management is now in a po-
sition to influence rather than react to the supply base, and it can actually develop
key suppliers in cases where a weak link exists. Moreover, all of these processes help
establish the critical capabilities required of a global leader.
</p>
<p>Observations on Supply Management Strategy Evolution
It is important that the supply management student recognize an important point
</p>
<p>about the sequence shown in Exhibit 6.13 and the phases just discussed: Few orga-
nizations have fully executed the more complex strategies found in Phases 3 and 4.
This is due to a variety of factors including the relative complexity of higher-level
strategies, the resources and commitment necessary to execute the strategy, a lack of
a supply base optimization effort, and personnel who lack the skills and capabilities
necessary for developing advanced sourcing strategies. However, those that success-
fully execute more sophisticated and comprehensive sourcing strategies should realize
greater performance improvement over time. The following Good Practice Example il-
lustrates how one company developed a higher-level commodity strategy. This strat-
egy may be considered to be within the Phase 3&ndash;4 category of maturity.

Example
</p>
<p>Commodities Forecasting:
It&rsquo;s All in Your Head
</p>
<p>Strong global growth has pushed industrial commodity prices to new heights in 2006
and 2007. This has wreaked havoc with procurement budgets and created a quandary for buy-
ers trying to forecast pricing trends in the second half of 2007 and into 2008. In a nutshell,
forecasting has been muddled by supplier consolidations, pricing volatility, economic un-
certainties, monetary unpredictability, and geopolitical concerns.
</p>
<p>But forecasts are critical in business. Estimated prices are the core of product-development
budgets. Those estimates are also the basis for evaluating buying strategies, planning quar-
terly cash flows, making forward pricing decisions, and implementing such risk-management
plans as hedges.
</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a buyer to do in the face of all the economic uncertainty? Use his or her head.
</p>
<p>Of the three types of commodity price forecasts&mdash;those based on personal judgment, those re-
lying exclusively on historical price data, and those incorporating commodity futures prices
at the time of the forecast together with historical price data&mdash;the judgmental forecasts
have the best record of accuracy.
</p>
<p>According to Aasim Husain, of the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s research department in
Washington, analysis indicates that &ldquo;judgmental forecasts tend to outperform the model-
based forecasts over short horizons of one quarter for several commodities.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re also the
most popular, he says.
</p>
<p>Purchasing surveys show that many buying groups tend to use homegrown projections or fore-
casts developed for them by various research organizations. Academicians explain that&rsquo;s be-
cause statistical models can be short-circuited by the volatility of energy, metals, chemicals,
plastic resins, wood products, and other production materials.
</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re going to use personal judgment in commodities forecasting, you have to base it
on the right factors. Analysts and buyers alike agree that the most critical data to review
are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Market intelligence
&bull; Global economic trends
&bull; Supplier safeguards against volatility
&bull; Your own company&rsquo;s selling strategies
</p>
<p>Even in calm economic times, those tools are critical. With the current volatility in commodi-
ties, they&rsquo;re essential. &ldquo;The commodity markets are crazy these days,&rdquo; says Peter Connelly,
CPO at diversified manufacturer Leggett &amp; Platt in Carthage, Missouri, which buys $3.7
billion annually in production and packaging materials. &ldquo;Prices are affected by local and
world demand and supply trends, global currency movements, the economic policies of such
developing economies as Brazil, Russia, India, and China&mdash;and even today&rsquo;s instant
communications.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The latest demand boom for base metals is in its third year and has elevated nonferrous
metals pricing to record highs. Steel prices are reflecting iron ore, scrap, ferroalloy, and
energy costs&mdash;rather than demand trends&mdash;probably for the first time.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pricing cycles for commodities are shrinking,&rdquo; says the global procurement manager at a
Detroit-area auto parts company. &ldquo;The steel cycle used to be 7 to 10 years in length from
peak to valley in prices. Nowadays, it&rsquo;s more like 18 months due to the rapid change in deliv-
ery of information.&rdquo;

<p>226 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Atop all that, says Leggett &amp; Platt&rsquo;s Connelly, &ldquo;supplier consolidation and pricing volatility is
making forecasting difficult and, actually, past a 90-day window very inaccurate.&rdquo; Rather
than a sign of the top for commodity prices, analysts worry that the deal making could help
put a lid on supply and put even more pressure on a host of commodity prices.
</p>
<p>This view is supported by research director Anirvan Banerji at the Economic Cycle Research In-
stitute in New York. Most forecasters have a dismal record of predicting the timing of cycli-
cal turns in economic growth, jobs, and inflation, Banerji writes, &ldquo;because most people and
forecasting models expect recent patterns to persist in the near future.&rdquo; This is &ldquo;a sure rec-
ipe for being surprised on prices by the next turn in the global industrial cycle.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>And then, there is nature. The late-summer hurricanes of 2005 taught energy and petrochemi-
cal buyers just how fast supply can be disrupted and prices can explode.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about energy and raw materials these days,&rdquo; says Dan DiMicco, CEO of Nucor Corp.,
the Charlotte, North Carolina&ndash;based steelmaker. &ldquo;With the volatility in and high level of mate-
rials pricing nowadays, nobody wants to carry inventory&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s in the raw materials
at my mills or the finished products we ship to our customers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>INTELLIGENCE IS KING
Stating that &ldquo;in a commodity market today, intelligence is king,&rdquo; DiMicco tells a recent steel
industry conference that &ldquo;to run as efficiently as we can, mills and service centers will have
to start at the customer&mdash;and talk to buyers about what they really need and what they ex-
pect they will be paying. Only then can we take some volatility out of the metals market&mdash;
and come to some equitable long-term arrangements on price and supply.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>So, the foundation for any successful commodity forecasting program must be based on de-
tailed market knowledge that can smooth out current volatility and help ensure against dis-
rupted flow of raw materials, says Mike Burns, global business director for polyethylene at
supply chain consultancy Resin Technology Inc. in Fort Worth, Texas.
</p>
<p>Burns insists that buyers &ldquo;emerge from their comfortable silos&rdquo; and get knowledgeable
about global economics, supply, demand, and sourcing alternatives&mdash;&ldquo;whatever they need to
know to become expert about their company, their industry, and their regional and global sup-
ply chain.&rdquo; Solid market facts are needed to develop effective buying plans, and that in-
cludes accurate price forecasting, says Burns in an interview.
</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S A SMALL WORLD
A key piece of advice from this purchasing coach and several top-level buyers interviewed:
Whatever the commodity, watch the international marketplace to determine supply, demand,
pricing, and trading trends. That&rsquo;s because economic conditions that affect supply and pri-
ces are changeable&mdash;and usually global. &ldquo;Buyers have got to know demand, as best as they
can, but not just demand in North America&mdash;demand globally,&rdquo; says Burns.
</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s lean and highly outsourced supply chains leave procurement teams with little visibil-
ity to anticipate and react to global risks, complain some analysts. That&rsquo;s why they suggest
that buyers learn as much as possible about global supply chains and determine what safe-
guards their world supplier organizations are putting in place to maintain continuous supply
and honor agreed-upon future pricing.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The days of going out with an RFQ and a spreadsheet of needed materials are over,&rdquo; agrees
the commodities buyer for a Chicago-based multinational corporation. &ldquo;Past-paid price aver-
ages are just the start of what we&rsquo;ll expect to pay in the future. We have to work closely
with materials engineering and quality folks on the materials specifications and then we S

<p>have to find out what&rsquo;s available. Remember, you can&rsquo;t buy all over the world for the same
price&mdash;ever.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Yet another essential weapon in the commodities-forecasting wars is knowledge of your own
company&rsquo;s strategies. &ldquo;The key to future pricing is to remember that the company&rsquo;s sourcing
strategy is there to support the company&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; says Dan Ronchetto, vice president of
global direct materials for Greif in Delaware, Ohio. &ldquo;So, the purchasing organization has to
know how the company sells into the market&mdash;what the competitive dynamics are and how
competitors are competing.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In an interview, Ronchetto says the sourcing strategy has to be in line with the company&rsquo;s
sales strategy. If a company&rsquo;s sales are on an annual fixed basis, then purchasing arrange-
ments should be on an annual fixed-prices basis. &ldquo;The bottom line is the key issue! Wall
Street doesn&rsquo;t like surprises or volatility,&rdquo; he says. And it&rsquo;s not just for public companies.
Sourcing strategy has to be aligned with overall business strategy and how end customers
are served. &ldquo;If you sell monthly, buy monthly,&rdquo; Ronchetto advises. Fixed two-year or three-
year contracts are disappearing into indexing to adjust quarterly market changes, he says.
</p>
<p>Some analysts suggest that futures prices on commodity exchanges in London and New York
may be the best measure of imminent sales price trends. The various commodity futures ex-
change markets do provide a mechanism for price discovery on an aggregate level through ar-
bitrage between multiple buyers and sellers.
</p>
<p>To many buyers, though, futures trading is just one of several possible tools to guesstimate fu-
ture pricing&mdash;and only for certain raw materials. Although nonferrous metals are traded glob-
ally, other materials&mdash;such as resins and lumber products&mdash;have limited regional exchange
liquidity, and other materials, such as steel, have yet to find a trading floor. Also, price discov-
ery at any given location&mdash;whether that is New York, Chicago, Winnipeg, London, Tokyo, or
Shanghai&mdash;is not necessarily definitive because supply and demand relationships are murky.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, buyers are the ones expected to navigate the terrain. Says Greif&rsquo;s Ronchetto,
&ldquo;My CFO and other chief financial officers also are putting more and more pressure on
manufacturing and purchasing colleagues to reduce corporate costs.&rdquo; And forecasts, however
unscientific, are an important tool in that effort.
</p>
<p>TEN FORECASTING TIPS FOR BUYERS
1. Determine corporate price goals; if necessary, adjust them to economic realities.
2. Reduce purchasing pricing strategies to 30, 60, or 90 days.

<p>CONCLUSION
Category management is perhaps one of the most important ways that supply man-
</p>
<p>agers create value for their stakeholders. Category teams must effectively scan the mar-
ket environment, conduct research on suppliers and cost drivers, analyze internal
spend characteristics, and establish appropriate strategies for managing these relation-
ships. In doing so, supply managers depict and create insights for stakeholders on
key elements of their supply environment that shape their operational, financial, and
market planning decisions. Effective category strategies also create the foundation for
cost management, contract frameworks, and ongoing supplier performance manage-
ment metrics and relationships. These elements will be discussed in greater detail in
later chapters, but it is important for students to understand how to conduct re-
search and analysis leading to these actions.

<p>Selecting U.S.-Based Suppliers at Toyota Industrial
Equipment Manufacturing
</p>
<p>The need to evaluate and select suppliers comes about in many ways. During the devel-
opment of purchasing strategies, selecting the right supplier is central to success. The follow-
ing example shows that Toyota&rsquo;s supplier selection philosophy and its commitment to using
U.S.-based suppliers is a central part of its supplier selection strategy.
</p>
<p>Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (TIEM) is committed to building lift trucks in the
United States and to purchasing materials and components from domestic suppliers. TIEM is
the largest manufacturer of material-handling equipment in the world. Most of the products
it builds for the U.S. market are made in Columbus, IN, a facility that opened in 1990 and un-
derwent an $11 million expansion in 2005. In May, the plant celebrated the production of its
250,000th forklift truck.
</p>
<p>These American-made lift trucks are manufactured of steel, plastic parts, and other compo-
nents produced mainly by suppliers located in the United States. Roughly 60% of the Co-
lumbus plant&rsquo;s supply base now is domestic. TIEM&rsquo;s parent company in Japan, Toyota
Industries Corporation (TICO), still provides some critical components such as engines, which
it makes in large volumes for plants in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Sixteen years
ago when the Columbus facility opened, the ratio was reversed: Local suppliers provided
TIEM with 40% of the materials that went into the lift trucks made in the United States.
</p>
<p>According to Bruce Nolting, vice president of purchasing, production control, and logistics,
purchasing manages about 65 key suppliers in the United States, which provide 75% of the
materials and components that go into the lift trucks built in Columbus. These key suppliers
provide TIEM with critical parts, make daily deliveries or &ldquo;milk runs&rdquo; to the plant, and are
on the kanban system, which is key to meeting the just-in-time (JIT) requirements of the
Toyota production system in place at the facility.
</p>
<p>This transition to increased purchasing through U.S. suppliers is part of TICO&rsquo;s overall pro-
curement policy to buy from domestic suppliers as a way to help keep local economies
healthy. In Columbus, TIEM puts these words into action; purchasing and quality assurance
work closely together to qualify and develop key suppliers.
</p>
<p>Working together, purchasing and quality assurance look for suppliers that can provide mate-
rials and components at a lower price to TIEM with as good or better quality, and the capabil-
ity to provide deliveries to the plant daily or multiple times per day. They use a formula that
takes into account such criteria as piece price, inventory carrying costs, and freight.
</p>
<p>SUPPLIER QUALIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT
Nolting&rsquo;s purchasing team consists of six purchasing specialists who manage categories of
related materials or components, such as steel and steel products. These specialists are re-
sponsible for supplier selection, evaluation and development, and working with quality assur-
ance, as well as cost reduction activities. Steve Pride, TIEM&rsquo;s purchasing manager, oversees
their efforts.
</p>
<p>Pride serves on a Toyota Material Handling Group global purchasing committee that consists
of representatives of facilities in Europe and Asia. He and his team also are in daily contact
with colleagues in Japan via videoconferencing and e-mail during model changes.
</p>
<p>Looking to keep the supply base a manageable size, TIEM&rsquo;s purchasing and quality assur-
ance department approach a domestic supplier that manufactures similar parts to determine
whether it has the capacity to provide the plant with additional components.

<p>234 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ldquo;We are looking at a small supply base that supports us in 100% of our needs on a particu-
lar part,&rdquo; says Nolting. &ldquo;Very rarely do we purchase one part number from dual sources. Our
idea is to keep the number of suppliers small, but support them and make sure we feed
them accurate forecast information to ensure they have ample capacity to meet our require-
ments.&rdquo; If the supplier needs assistance with equipment or tooling to take on the additional
requirements, TIEM provides the resources.
</p>
<p>To qualify a domestic supplier, purchasing and quality assurance visit the supplier&rsquo;s plant
and conduct a thorough audit that includes a survey consisting of 130 questions, such as:
How do you manage your process? How do you evaluate internal quality? Do you have stan-
dardized work in your process? The audit team also queries the supplier on its financial
health.
</p>
<p>Once a supplier is selected, the team works with suppliers on continuous improvement activi-
ties. Purchasing and quality assurance evaluate the supplier&rsquo;s performance using quality,
cost, and delivery metrics. They issue a report card monthly and recognize top performers
with an annual supplier award. Purchasing specialists work with suppliers to resolve any is-
sues that may arise.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel very committed to the suppliers we select,&rdquo; says Nolting. &ldquo;Once we make a commit-
ment, we do everything possible to get the supplier to the level of our expectation. We don&rsquo;t
make many changes in our supply base.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Twice each year, purchasing and quality assurance work with a small group of suppliers on
process improvements that ensure they are providing the plant with good-quality parts. The
group consists of suppliers that may have had a number of rejects during a specific time
period, or another quality issue.
</p>
<p>Recently, a group of five suppliers met with purchasing and quality assurance in Columbus
to resolve some recurring problems. Three of the suppliers were providing components that
were causing issues in the field. The other two were providing parts that the company was re-
jecting at the plant.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ask the supplier to identify the issue and by using a format we provide, let us know
how they plan to resolve it,&rdquo; says Nolting. &ldquo;We do this in an open forum with representatives
of all five suppliers meeting with our management in one room. It&rsquo;s proven very effective.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Key domestic suppliers provide laser- and gas-cut plate steel used to make frames and
masts, tubing components that go into lift cylinders, chrome-plated rods, plastic parts,
metal stampings, tires, and wheels. (MRO tool crib items bring the total number of domestic
suppliers to a little more than 200.) Nolting declined to disclose the plant&rsquo;s annual spend.
</p>
<p>Even so, the move to domestic suppliers hasn&rsquo;t been 100% successful, Nolting says. In a
few cases, the company has had to move purchasing of certain components back to Japan be-
cause of quality or delivery issues.
</p>
<p>TIEM&rsquo;s success with supplier development&mdash;and manufacturing in the United States&mdash;goes
back to the selection process, a joint effort between purchasing and quality assurance. &ldquo;We
know what questions to ask,&rdquo; says Nolting. &ldquo;We know what to look for in a supplier. We
don&rsquo;t make many changes to our supply base. We are willing to make a commitment. I think
our record really proves that we are here for the long run. A supplier hooks its wagon to this
group and it can be a long, prosperous ride down the trail, so to speak.&rdquo;

<p>Chapter 7 Supplier Evaluation and Selection 235</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>One of the most important processes that organizations perform is the evaluation, se-
lection, and continuous measurement of suppliers. Traditionally, competitive bidding
was the primary method for awarding purchase contracts. In the past, it was suffi-
cient to obtain three bids and award the contract to the supplier offering the lowest
price. Enlightened purchasers now commit major resources to evaluating a supplier&rsquo;s
performance and capability across many different areas. The supplier selection pro-
cess has become so important that teams of cross-functional personnel are often re-
sponsible for visiting and evaluating suppliers. A sound selection decision can reduce
or prevent a host of problems.
</p>
<p>Supplier evaluation and selection decisions are taking on increased importance to-
day. If a firm has reduced its supply base to a much smaller level, and if remaining
suppliers usually receive longer-term agreements, the willingness or ability to switch
suppliers is diminished. This makes selecting the right suppliers an important busi-
ness decision.
</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on different topics and issues pertaining to the evaluation
and selection of suppliers. The first section provides an overview of the evaluation
and selection process. The next sections present the various performance categories
that a purchaser can include within the evaluation and selection process. The third
section focuses on an approach for developing a tool or instrument for use during sup-
plier evaluations. We next highlight the critical issues that confront a purchaser dur-
ing the selection process. The chapter concludes with ways to reduce the time
required for selection decisions.
</p>
<p>The Supplier Evaluation and Selection Process
Most purchasing experts will agree that there is no one best way to evaluate and se-
</p>
<p>lect suppliers, and organizations use a variety of different approaches. Regardless of
the approach employed, the overall objective of the evaluation process should be to re-
duce purchase risk and maximize overall value to the purchaser.
</p>
<p>An organization must select suppliers it can do business with over an extended pe-
riod. The degree of effort associated with the selection relates to the importance of
the required good or service. Depending on the supplier evaluation approach used,
the process can be an intensive effort requiring a major commitment of resources
(such as time and travel). This section addresses the many issues and decisions in-
volved in effectively and efficiently evaluating and selecting suppliers to be part of
the purchaser&rsquo;s supply base. Exhibit 7.1 highlights the critical steps involved in the
supplier evaluation and selection process.
</p>
<p>Recognize the Need for Supplier Selection
The first step of the evaluation and selection process usually involves recognizing
</p>
<p>that there is a requirement to evaluate and select a supplier for an item or service. A
purchasing manager might begin the supplier evaluation process in anticipation of a
future purchase requirement. Purchasing may have early insight into new-product de-
velopment plans through participation on a product development team. In this case,
engineering personnel may provide some preliminary specifications on the type of ma-
terials, service, or processes required, but will not yet have specific details. ThisS

<p>preliminary information may be enough to justify beginning an initial evaluation of
potential sources of supply.
</p>
<p>The recognition that a need exists to evaluate suppliers can come about in many
different ways. Exhibit 7.2 on p. 238 identifies the most common ways that result in
a need to evaluate sources of supply. Progressive purchasing groups increasingly antic-
ipate rather than react to supplier selection needs. The complexity and value of a re-
quired purchase will influence the extent to which a buyer evaluates potential supply
sources.
</p>
<p>Identify Key Sourcing Requirements
Throughout the supplier evaluation and selection process, it is important to under-
</p>
<p>stand the requirements that are important to that purchase. These requirements, of-
ten determined by internal and external customers within the value chain, can differ
widely from item to item. A later section discusses the various supplier performance
areas where a purchaser should determine its critical sourcing requirements. Al-
though different requirements may exist for each evaluation, certain categories&mdash;sup-
plier quality, cost, and delivery performance&mdash;are usually included in the evaluation.
</p>
<p>Determine Sourcing Strategy
No single sourcing strategy approach will satisfy the requirements of all purchases.
</p>
<p>Because of this, the purchasing strategy adopted for a particular item or service will in-
fluence the approach taken during the supplier evaluation and selection process. In
this chapter, we will not go into detail on the processes used to develop a commodity

<p>strategy. Chapter 6 covers this subject in detail. There are many decisions that a pur-
chaser initially makes when developing a sourcing strategy. However, these often
change as a result of market conditions, user preferences, and corporate objectives.
The considerations developed during the strategy phase need to be re-evaluated dur-
ing the selection process. The strategy options selected will greatly influence the sup-
plier selection and evaluation process.
</p>
<p>These key decisions include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Single versus multiple supply sources
</p>
<p>&bull; Short-term versus long-term purchase contracts
</p>
<p>&bull; Selecting suppliers that provide design support versus those that lack design
capability
</p>
<p>&bull; Full-service versus non-full-service suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Domestic versus foreign suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Expectation of a close working relationship versus arm&rsquo;s-length purchasing
</p>
<p>Identify Potential Supply Sources
Purchasers rely on various sources of information when identifying potential
</p>
<p>sources of supply. The degree to which a buyer must search for information or the ef-
fort put forth toward the search is a function of several variables, including how well
existing suppliers can satisfy cost, quality, or other performance variables. The strate-
gic importance or technical complexity of the purchase requirement also influences
the intensity of the search. The following offers some guidelines regarding the effort
and intensity of search required during supplier evaluation:
</p>
<p>&bull; High capability of current suppliers + High strategic importance of require-
ment = Minor to moderate information search

</p>
<p>&bull; Low capability of current suppliers + High strategic importance of require-

</p>
<p>&bull; Low capability of current suppliers + Low strategic importance of require-
ment = Minor to moderate information search
</p>
<p>The following sections discuss various resources that may be good sources of infor-
mation when seeking to identify potential supply sources.
</p>
<p>Current Suppliers
A major source of information is current or existing suppliers. Buyers often look
</p>
<p>to existing suppliers to satisfy a new purchase requirement. The advantage of this ap-
proach is that the purchaser does not have to add and maintain an additional sup-
plier. Also, the buyer can do business with an already familiar supplier, which may
limit the time and resources required to evaluate a new supplier&rsquo;s capabilities.
</p>
<p>On the negative side, using existing suppliers, although perhaps easier and
quicker, may not always be the best long-term approach. A purchasing manager may
never know if better suppliers are available without information on other sources.
For this reason, most organizations are continuously seeking new sources of supply
and are expanding this search to include suppliers from around the world.
</p>
<p>Selecting an existing supplier for a new purchase requirement may be an attractive
option if a list of preferred suppliers is maintained. Designation as a preferred supplier
means that a supplier consistently satisfies the performance and service standards de-
fined by the buyer. A preferred supplier status conveys immediate information about
the supplier&rsquo;s overall performance and competency. However, the buyer must still
determine if a preferred supplier is capable of providing a particular purchase
requirement.
</p>
<p>Sales Representatives
All purchasers receive sales and marketing information from sales representatives.
</p>
<p>These contacts can prove to be a valuable source of information about potential
sources. Even if an immediate need does not exist for a supplier&rsquo;s services, the buyer
can file the information for future reference. A visit to a purchasing manager&rsquo;s office
would probably reveal a set of cabinets or drawers that contain sales and marketing
information.
</p>
<p>Information Databases
Some companies maintain databases of suppliers that are capable of supporting an
</p>
<p>industry or product line. NCR, for example, maintains data on about 30,000 compa-
nies serving the computer industry. The company searches trade journals and finan-
cial newspapers for information about potential suppliers. The use of an automated
database or data warehouse can quickly identify suppliers potentially qualified to sup-
port a requirement.
</p>
<p>Maintaining a supplier database is particularly important in industries where technol-
ogy changes rapidly. The database may contain information on current products, the
supplier&rsquo;s future technology roadmap, process capability ratios, and past performance.

<p>Chapter 7 Supplier Evaluation and Selection 239</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Databases of potential supply sources are also available for purchase from external par-
ties. These can be especially valuable when searching for foreign sources of supply.
</p>
<p>Experience
Experienced purchasing personnel usually have strong knowledge about potential
</p>
<p>suppliers. A buyer may have worked within an industry over many years and may be
familiar with the suppliers, perhaps including international suppliers. One argument
against rotating buyers too frequently between product lines or types of purchases is
that a buyer may lose the expertise built up over the years. Experience and knowl-
edge become valuable because few purchasing organizations have developed an intelli-
gence database about suppliers.
</p>
<p>Trade Journals
Most industries have a group or council that publishes a trade journal or maga-
</p>
<p>zine that routinely presents articles about different companies. These articles often
focus on a company&rsquo;s technical or innovative development of a material, component,
product, process, or service. Suppliers also use trade journals to advertise their prod-
ucts or services. Most buyers follow (or should follow) trade journals closely.
</p>
<p>Trade Directories
Almost all industries publish directories of companies that produce items or pro-
</p>
<p>vide services within an industry. Such directories can be a valuable source of initial
information for a buyer who is not familiar with an industry or its suppliers. Chap-
ter 10 provides some examples of international supplier directories. A very popular
directory for domestic buyers is the Thomas Register of American Manufacturers.
This directory can be located at www.thomasnet.com.
</p>
<p>Trade Shows
Trade shows may be an effective way to gain exposure to a large number of suppli-
</p>
<p>ers at one time. Groups such as the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the
American Society of Automotive Suppliers often sponsor trade shows. The National
Machine Tool Builders Show in Chicago is one of the largest trade shows held in the
United States. Buyers attending trade shows can gather information about potential
suppliers while also evaluating the latest technological developments. Many contacts
are initiated between industrial buyers and sellers at trade shows.
</p>
<p>Second-Party or Indirect Information
This source of information includes a wide range of contacts not directly part of
</p>
<p>the purchaser&rsquo;s organization. A buyer can gather information from other suppliers,
such as knowledge about a noncompetitor that might be valuable. Other buyers are
another second-party information source. Attendees at meetings of the Institute for
Supply Management can develop informal networks that provide information about
potential supply sources. Other professional groups include the American Production
and Inventory Control Society, the Council for Supply Chain Management Profes-
sionals, the American Manufacturing Engineering Association, and the American So-
ciety for Quality Control.
</p>
<p>Some purchasers publicly recognize their best suppliers. Recognition may come in
the form of a newspaper advertisement that highlights the achievement of superior

<p>suppliers. Ford Motor Corporation, for example, periodically purchases a full-page ad-
vertisement in the Wall Street Journal expressing appreciation and recognition of its
best suppliers. In the advertisement, Ford lists each supplier by name and why it is
being recognized. Because of Ford&rsquo;s approach to recognizing its best suppliers, a
buyer gains visibility to a group of blue-chip suppliers.
</p>
<p>Internal Sources
Many larger companies divide the organization into units, each with a separate pur-
</p>
<p>chasing operation. Sharing information across units can occur through informal meet-
ings, strategy development sessions, purchasing newsletters, or the development of a
comprehensive database containing information about potential supply sources. Inter-
nal sources, even those from diverse business units, can provide a great deal of infor-
mation about potential supply sources.
</p>
<p>Internet Searches
Buyers are increasingly using the Internet to help locate potential sources that
</p>
<p>might qualify for further evaluation. Sellers are increasingly using the Internet as an
important part of their direct marketing efforts.
</p>
<p>After collecting information about potential supply sources, the purchasing man-
ager must begin to sift through and consolidate the information. This can be a huge
task, depending on the number of suppliers and the information obtained. During its
search for global suppliers for an item, Mack Trucks (part of Volvo) may collect or re-
quest information from 500 suppliers. It categorizes this information and puts it into
a worldwide database for current and future reference. At some point, companies
must eliminate suppliers that do not have a good fit with the buyer.

</p>
<p>Chemical Distributors
Select Global Suppliers
with a Customer Focus
</p>
<p>Chemical distributors are expanding their global sourcing. International sourcing must
be a win-win; their customers need to ensure that what they buy&mdash;and where they buy it
from&mdash;is on their customers&rsquo; wish list. Buyers at chemical distributors emphasize thorough
supplier evaluation and product testing in their global supplier selection process.
</p>
<p>Tom Corcoran is vice president of sales and sourcing at Brenntag North America, a Reading,
PA&ndash;based subsidiary of the German chemical distributor that sources from and sells into a
variety of overseas markets. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t simply look at global sourcing as leverage for better
pricing, but rather we look at it as a way to expand the sourcing options for our customers,&rdquo;
he says. That philosophy is embodied in Corcoran&rsquo;s unique title, which includes both sales
and sourcing. As a distributor, Brenntag is, in effect, selling its suppliers to its customers,
and therefore, its buyers are more closely tied to the customer side than in a typical

customers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Corcoran says he has an advantage in global sourcing because his company is a subsidiary
of the global distributor. Corcoran has counterparts in various other global regions, including
Latin America and Europe, which provide leads and assistance in uncovering new suppliers
on a case-by-case basis.
</p>
<p>Also, Brenntag North America inherited a sourcing office in China when it acquired Los An-
geles Chemical, which it has found it to be an extremely useful asset in its efforts to source
more from China. The four sourcing employees there work to ensure that the suppliers Brenn-
tag recruits from that market meet its needs in terms of quality and reliability. Brenntag has
an office in Shanghai, and his manager there spends time interacting with suppliers and cus-
tomers looking for information on how to go to market in China and extract the value out of
those markets.
</p>
<p>Beyond those regions, Corcoran says he is investigating India very closely as a potential
source for new suppliers. &ldquo;We have some suppliers in India now,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but more and
more that is becoming a strategic marketplace for us.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Shondra Garrigus is vice president of purchasing at Seattle-based TRInternational (TRI) and
says the company&rsquo;s experience in exporting products to various global markets (most notably
Europe) has helped the purchasing organization streamline its global sourcing efforts. &ldquo;For a
company our size&mdash;we&rsquo;re on the small side&mdash;to survive in the chemical industry, we have to
be a little bit more innovative about how we source,&rdquo; Garrigus says. In the past, the com-
pany has sourced up to 75% of its products from outside the United States, but today that
amount has been pared back to about 60%, due mostly to recent currency fluctuations in
Europe.
</p>
<p>Like many purchasing executives, Garrigus is focused on China. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotten some materi-
als like citric acid from China for a while, but we&rsquo;re rapidly expanding the list of chemicals
we source from China,&rdquo; Garrigus says. &ldquo;In the past year, we&rsquo;ve been expanding the breadth
of products coming out of China.&rdquo; The biggest challenge in global sourcing, she says, is edu-
cating suppliers in new regions about how to export efficiently to the U.S. market. For exam-
ple, in China there are fewer regulations on the types of packaging or drums that chemicals
can be shipped in.
</p>
<p>SUPPLIER EVALUATION
As important as supplier evaluation is for manufacturers in global sourcing, it&rsquo;s even more
important for distributors. If a manufacturer finds it has been working with a less-than-
reputable supplier, it&rsquo;s a problem, but often the problem can be rectified before the end cus-
tomer is impacted. However, poor supplier selection in distribution can have a direct impact
on customer satisfaction in the distribution business.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same parameters we&rsquo;d hold for our domestic suppliers, we hold for all of our foreign sup-
pliers as well,&rdquo; says Corcoran. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the customers&rsquo; requirements don&rsquo;t change
based on the supplier&rsquo;s location.&rdquo; But when it comes to global sourcing, learning by mistake
is sometimes the only way.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone who has been doing this a long time has been burned on more than one occasion,&rdquo;
says Garrigus. &ldquo;It comes with the territory. But we can learn from those experiences. Beyond
cost, it&rsquo;s most important to us to make sure we have a secure supply line for our customers.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Sourcing Alternatives
Once the list of potential and current suppliers is put into a database, it is further
</p>
<p>refined considering the type of supplier a firm may wish to deal with based on the ini-
tial sourcing strategy. Major sourcing alternatives include whether to purchase from
a (1) manufacturer or distributor; (2) local or national or international source; (3)
small or large supplier; and (4) multiple or single supplier for the item, commodity,
or service.
</p>
<p>Manufacturer vs. Distributor
The choice of buying directly versus from a distributor is usually based on four cri-
</p>
<p>teria: (1) the size of the purchase; (2) the manufacturer&rsquo;s policies regarding direct
sales; (3) the storage space available at the purchaser&rsquo;s facility; and (4) the extent of
services required.
</p>
<p>Economically speaking, if all else is equal, the lowest unit price will be available
from the OEM. The distributor buys from the OEM and resells, therefore incurring a
transaction cost, and it must make a profit. Despite the exchange cost, recent trends
have increased the role of distributors in providing the purchaser a low-cost solution.
First, many OEMs can&rsquo;t handle or choose not to handle the large volume of transac-
tions required to sell directly. Second, buyers are requiring more services from their
suppliers and distributors have stepped in to fill this need. Vendor Managed Inventory is
a program that distributors market to manage their customer&rsquo;s inventory for them.
Several organizations are using integrated supply, where a distributor is awarded a lon-
ger-term contract. Integrated suppliers are given access to the purchaser&rsquo;s demand
data and are expected to maintain certain levels of inventory and customer service
on the contracted items.
</p>
<p>Local or National or International Suppliers
International and national suppliers may be able to offer the best price and supe-
</p>
<p>rior technical service. Alternatively, local suppliers are more responsive to the buying
firm&rsquo;s changing needs and can economically make frequent smaller deliveries. The
popularity of JIT and quick-replenishment systems favor using more local suppliers.
Local suppliers also allow the buying firm to build a degree of community goodwill
through enhancing local economic activity (see the Toyota case at the beginning of
this chapter). International suppliers provide opportunities to attain dramatic price
</p>
<p>We have to make sure the suppliers we&rsquo;re working with are reputable and will be around for
a long time.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Both Brenntag and TRI receive requests from customers specifying that nothing they buy can
be sourced from outside the United States, especially for application-specific and specialty
products. Other customers prefer products from certain regions or countries.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes customers have a valid reason, but we can sometimes break their biases by pro-
viding the right materials,&rdquo; says Garrigus. &ldquo;We can show them that while this might not be
the same supplier they are used to, this is a quality product and can save them money.&rdquo;

<p>savings. These savings must be evaluated against the additional inventory, communi-
cation, and logistics costs (see Chapter 10 for a complete discussion).
</p>
<p>Large or Small Suppliers
All suppliers were at one time small suppliers. Growth over time is due to provid-
</p>
<p>ing superior price, quality, and service compared to their competitors. Many pur-
chasers prefer to focus on &ldquo;capability to do the job&rdquo; regardless of size. Size does
become a factor when one firm decides to leverage its purchases from one or a few
suppliers. This leveraging means that the supplier must have wide variety in its prod-
uct or service offerings as well as the ability to service multiple geographic locations
(in some cases worldwide locations).
</p>
<p>Often the buying firm does not want the seller to become dependent on its busi-
ness. Thus the purchaser would make sure that its purchases do not represent more
than a certain percentage (e.g., 35&ndash;45%) of the supplier&rsquo;s total business. Finally, sup-
ply departments that are building diversity into the supply base will often deal with
an increased number of small suppliers.
</p>
<p>Multiple or Single Sourcing
Once the number of suppliers is reduced to those qualified, a decision on the opti-
</p>
<p>mal number of suppliers in the supply base needs to be made. Certainly there is a
trend to reduce the number of suppliers. Although single sourcing provides optimum
leverage and power over the supplier, multiple sourcing provides improved assurance
of supply.
</p>
<p>Limit Suppliers in Selection Pool
The result of this information gathering is that, depending upon the item under
</p>
<p>consideration, a purchaser may have many potential sources from which to choose.
Unfortunately, the performance capabilities of suppliers vary widely. Limited re-
sources also preclude an in-depth evaluation of all potential supply sources. Pur-
chasers often perform a first cut or preliminary evaluation of potential suppliers to
narrow the list before conducting an in-depth formal evaluation. Several criteria may
support the narrowing of the supplier list.
</p>
<p>Financial Risk Analysis
Most purchasers perform at least a cursory financial analysis of prospective suppli-
</p>
<p>ers. Although financial condition is not the only criterion upon which to evaluate a
supplier, poor financial condition can indicate serious problems. A financial analysis
performed during this phase of the process is much less comprehensive than the one
performed during final supplier evaluation. During this phase, a purchaser is trying
to get a feel for the overall financial health of the supplier. Buyers often consult exter-
nal sources of information such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) reports to support the
evaluation.
</p>
<p>Evaluation of Supplier Performance
A prospective supplier may have an established performance record with a pur-
</p>
<p>chaser. A purchaser may have used a supplier for a previous purchase requirement,
or a supplier may currently provide material to another part of the organization. A
supplier may also have provided other types of commodities or services to the

<p>purchaser than those under consideration. Based on prior experience, a purchasing
manager may consider that supplier for a different type of commodity or service.
</p>
<p>Evaluation of Supplier-Provided Information
Buyers often request specific information directly from potential suppliers. Re-
</p>
<p>quests for information involve sending a preliminary survey to suppliers. The buyer
uses this information to screen each supplier and to determine if the buyer&rsquo;s require-
ments appear to match the supplier&rsquo;s capabilities. Buyers can request information on
a supplier&rsquo;s cost structure, process technology, market share data, quality perfor-
mance, or any other area important to the purchase decision.
</p>
<p>A major U.S. chemical producer mandates that suppliers complete requests for in-
formation (which it calls presurvey questionnaires) before conducting more detailed
supplier surveys. Besides ownership, financial information, and type of business, this
company attempts to determine how sophisticated the supplier&rsquo;s current practices are
and how far along it is toward achieving total quality.
</p>
<p>Before committing time to evaluate a supplier further, suppliers should satisfy cer-
tain entry qualifiers. Entry qualifiers are the basic components that suppliers must pos-
sess before they proceed to the next phase of the evaluation and selection process. One
researcher identifies five qualifiers that suppliers must satisfy: financial strength, appro-
priate business strategy, strong supportive management, proven manufacturing capabil-
ity, and design capability.1 The time and cost associated with evaluating suppliers
makes it necessary to limit suppliers in the selection pool that meet these qualifiers.
</p>
<p>Determine the Method of Supplier Evaluation
and Selection
</p>
<p>Once an initial cut has eliminated suppliers that are not capable, the buyer or com-
modity team must decide how to evaluate the remaining suppliers, which may ap-
pear to be equally qualified. This requires a finer level of evaluation detail than that
used in the initial process. There are a number of ways to evaluate and select suppli-
ers from the remaining companies in the pool. These include evaluating supplier-
provided information, conducting supplier visits, and using preferred supplier lists.
</p>
<p>Evaluation from Supplier-Provided Information
Buyers often receive and evaluate detailed information directly from potential sup-
</p>
<p>pliers for the purpose of awarding a purchase contract. This information may come
from requests for quotes or requests for proposals. Not too long ago buyers made al-
most all purchase decisions using this method. In recent years, however, many organi-
zations have adopted a more direct and in-depth approach to evaluating potential
suppliers. Increasingly, companies are also requesting that suppliers provide a de-
tailed cost breakdown of their quoted price in the response to a request for quote, in-
cluding details on labor, materials, overhead, and profit.
</p>
<p>Supplier Visits
A team of cross-functional experts may visit potential suppliers. The next section
</p>
<p>discusses the criteria often used by cross-functional teams during supplier visits. Al-
though many sources exist to discover information about a potential supplier, visiting
the actual facility provides the most complete way to ensure an accurate assessment

<p>of the supplier. Site visits are expensive and require buyer time in travel and informa-
tion collection. The purchaser needs to be alert and gather all necessary information
while being sensitive to the supplier&rsquo;s limitations on restricted information. Exhibit
7.3 provides a checklist of the key evaluation criteria that should be noted during the
site visit. Key personal contacts in management, operations, and marketing may be
useful resources in the later stages of the selection process.
</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the supplier is a potential or existing supplier, the pur-
chaser should compile this data into a report that is maintained in a data warehouse
or on file for easy retrieval by members of the cross-functional team. Evaluation crite-
ria are covered in detail in the next section.
</p>
<p>The use of teams for supplier evaluation and selection is increasing, particularly
among larger organizations that have the resources to commit to this approach. The
advantage to the team approach is that each team member contributes unique insight
into the overall supplier evaluation. Members may have expertise in quality, engineer-
ing capabilities, or manufacturing techniques, and they may be qualified to assess sup-
pliers in these areas.
</p>
<p>Use of Preferred Suppliers
Increasingly, purchasers are rewarding their best suppliers by creating preferred
</p>
<p>supplier lists, which can simplify the supplier evaluation and selection process. A pre-
ferred supplier is one that consistently meets stringent performance criteria. A buyer
can refer to the purchasing database to determine if there is a current supplier that
can satisfy the purchase requirement. This eliminates the need to perform a time-
consuming evaluation. Buyers can also use a preferred supplier list as an incentive to
improve the performance of existing suppliers. Only the best suppliers should receive
placement on a preferred supplier list.

<p>Select Supplier and Reach Agreement
The final step of the evaluation and selection process is to select the supplier(s)
</p>
<p>and reach a contract agreement. The activities associated with this step can vary
widely depending on the purchase item under consideration. For routine items, this
may simply require notifying and awarding a basic purchase contract to a supplier.
For a major purchase, the process can become more complex. The buyer and seller
may have to conduct detailed negotiations to agree upon the specific details of a pur-
chase agreement.

</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: You work for a small organization that simply does not have the
financial or human resources to qualify suppliers. Or perhaps you have a minor purchase re-
quirement that does not justify a major search. Do you simply hope for the best when mak-
ing your selection? Will you be reluctant to try new suppliers for fear that the risk of the
unknown is simply too great? For many organizations and purchase situations, supplier evalu-
ation is a luxury when it should be a necessity.
</p>
<p>What can you do when faced with these situations? One option is to use an external party to
collect and disseminate supplier performance data. Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B), a supplier of
business information and receivables management services, offers its Supplier Qualifier Re-
port over the Internet. Users around the world can now purchase with a credit card the sup-
plier evaluation report for any of the 80 million businesses worldwide contained in D&amp;B&rsquo;s
database.
</p>
<p>Designed for purchasing professionals, qualifier reports provide an objective, third-party view
of suppliers. These reports provide a wide range of information about suppliers, including a
business overview, history and operations, payment information, risk assessment, financial in-
formation, and public filings. The reports also indicate if a supplier is ISO 9000 registered or
a minority- or women-owned business. D&amp;B maintains that the report is a tremendous re-
source for companies that want to confidently do business with suppliers.

<p>Key Supplier Evaluation Criteria
Purchasers usually evaluate potential suppliers across multiple categories using
</p>
<p>their own selection criteria with assigned weights. Purchasers that need consistent de-
livery performance with short lead times to support a just-in-time production system
might emphasize a supplier&rsquo;s scheduling and production systems. A high-technology
buyer might emphasize a supplier&rsquo;s process and technological capabilities or commit-
ment to research and development. The selection process for a distributor or service
provider will emphasize a different set of criteria.
</p>
<p>Most evaluations rate suppliers on three primary criteria: (1) cost or price, (2) qual-
ity, and (3) delivery. These three elements of performance are generally the most obvi-
ous and most critical areas that affect the purchaser. For critical items needing an in-
depth analysis of the supplier&rsquo;s capabilities, a more detailed supplier evaluation study
is required. The following presents the wide range of criteria that a purchaser might
consider during supplier evaluation and selection.

</p>
<p>Good Ideas When Evaluat-
ing IT Suppliers
</p>
<p>Buyers of information technology (IT) know that choosing the wrong supplier can create
problems that last for many years. The rate of technological change can make the perfect sup-
plier obsolete within months. Unfortunately, it is usually next to impossible to switch to a
new IT supplier quickly. For this reason, the selection process takes on added importance. IT
experts offer some sound suggestions when making supplier selection decisions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Do not rely on only one supplier. Too many companies try to complete all of their
computer technology buying using one or two big suppliers. Try to build a supply
network that includes some smaller suppliers that have promising emerging
technologies.
</p>
<p>&bull; Make sure you and the supplier are moving down the same road. Evaluate each
supplier&rsquo;s technology and product roadmaps. Are both organizations working to-
ward platforms, capabilities, features, and functions that are compatible?
</p>
<p>&bull; Build your portfolio with the best. Choose suppliers that add strength to your abil-
ity to add value to your end customer. Do not select suppliers simply because
they offer a good purchase price.
</p>
<p>&bull; Be a big fish in a little pond. Sourcing from the biggest supplier might bring a
good purchase price but limits your ability to leverage. A smaller supplier may be
more motivated to innovate in your direction.
</p>
<p>&bull; Know the supplier&rsquo;s Internet strategy. Understand how your suppliers are using
the Internet to add value to what they develop, manufacture, service, or
distribute.
</p>
<p>Because information technology has become increasingly important to supply chain manage-
ment, making the right IT supplier selection decision can mean the difference between suc-
cess and failure.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Management Capability
It is important for a buyer to evaluate a supplier&rsquo;s management capability. After
</p>
<p>all, management runs the business and makes the decisions that affect the competitive-
ness of the supplier. A buyer should ask many questions when evaluating a supplier&rsquo;s
management capability:
</p>
<p>&bull; Does management practice long-range planning?
</p>
<p>&bull; Has management committed the supplier to total quality management
(TQM) and continuous improvement?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is turnover high among managers?
</p>
<p>&bull; What are the professional experience and educational backgrounds of the
key managers?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is there a vision about the future direction of the company?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is management customer focused?
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the history of labor/management relations?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is management making the investments that are necessary to sustain and
grow the business?
</p>
<p>&bull; Has management prepared the company to face future competitive chal-
lenges, including providing employee training and development?
</p>
<p>&bull; Does management understand the importance of strategic sourcing?
</p>
<p>It may be a challenge to identify the true state of affairs during a brief visit or
using a questionnaire. Nevertheless, asking these questions can help the purchasing
manager to develop a feeling for the professional capabilities of the managers in the
supplying organization. When interviewing managers, it is important to attempt to
meet with as many people as possible in order to paint a true picture.
</p>
<p>Employee Capabilities
This part of the evaluation process requires an assessment of non-management per-
</p>
<p>sonnel. Do not underestimate the benefit that a highly trained, stable, and motivated
workforce provides, particularly during periods of labor shortages. A purchaser
should consider these points:
</p>
<p>&bull; The degree to which employees are committed to quality and continuous
improvement
</p>
<p>&bull; The overall skills and abilities of the workforce
</p>
<p>&bull; Employee-management relations
</p>
<p>&bull; Worker flexibility
</p>
<p>&bull; Employee morale
</p>
<p>&bull; Workforce turnover
</p>
<p>&bull; Willingness of employees to contribute to improved operations
</p>
<p>A buyer should also gather information about the history of strikes and labor dis-
putes. This can result in a general idea of how dedicated the supplier&rsquo;s employees are
to producing products or services that will meet or exceed the buyer&rsquo;s expectations.

<p>Cost Structure
Evaluating a supplier&rsquo;s cost structure requires an in-depth understanding of a sup-
</p>
<p>plier&rsquo;s total costs, including direct labor costs, indirect labor costs, material costs,
manufacturing or process operating costs, and general overhead costs. Understanding
a supplier&rsquo;s cost structure helps a buyer determine how efficiently a supplier can pro-
duce an item. A cost analysis also helps identify potential areas of cost improvement.

<p>Collecting this information can be a challenge. A supplier may not have a detailed
understanding of its costs. Many suppliers do not have a sophisticated cost accounting

<p>H.B. Fuller Uses Supplier
Visits to Narrow the
Supply Base
</p>
<p>H.B. Fuller Corporation illustrates how first-hand information gained through supplier
visits plays a large part in narrowing the supply base.
</p>
<p>Latin America sourcing manager Roy Calder&oacute;n of H.B. Fuller narrows down his list of suppli-
ers by obtaining first-hand information. Whenever possible, that means touring supplier
plants and interacting with the supplier&rsquo;s staff.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a technical and manufacturing background, so I first try to understand the logistical
and manufacturing capabilities of a supplier, as well as their quality assurance process and
systems,&rdquo; says Calder&oacute;n. What he sees at a supplier&rsquo;s plant helps him determine how much
H.B. Fuller, headquartered in St. Paul, MN, can expect from that supplier in the way of consis-
tent quality.
</p>
<p>Calder&oacute;n scrutinizes the plant&rsquo;s infrastructure as well as its production staff. &ldquo;Morale and
work environment is hard to put into hard numbers or dollars, but it needs to be part of a sup-
plier&rsquo;s intelligence profile,&rdquo; he says. Though he can&rsquo;t visit every single one of his suppliers,
he makes a point to visit at least the top 10 suppliers in his region.
</p>
<p>When visiting a supplier, Calder&oacute;n looks for any signs in the facilities that might signal fu-
ture supply problems. For example, if a machine looks like it might wear out or if the plant
seems like it&rsquo;s falling apart, he takes notice. He also inspects production line pacing as an-
other indicator of a supplier&rsquo;s health. If a supplier is too busy and overloaded, it might not
be responsive enough to any order changes. If it is too relaxed, it might not be economically
viable for much longer. Neither extreme is encouraging, Calder&oacute;n says.
</p>
<p>Another crucial component of supplier health is the attitude of employees on the plant floor.
Calder&oacute;n wants to see if they seem motivated or happy. He&rsquo;ll speak with employees about non-
technical topics, even just to ask them how they&rsquo;re doing, and gauge their reaction. If the
workers seem to be proud of their work, it&rsquo;s more likely that supplier will provide a consis-
tently high-quality product.
</p>
<p>Although some suppliers might want to keep Calder&oacute;n in the board room offices, he insists
on the broader picture. &ldquo;If all I see are fancy offices and the suppliers aren&rsquo;t willing to show
me their manufacturing process and let me talk to their employees, that&rsquo;s a big question
mark,&rdquo; he says.

some suppliers view cost data as highly proprietary. They may fear that the release of
cost information will undermine its pricing strategy or that competitors will gain access
to its cost data, which could provide insight into a supplier&rsquo;s competitive advantage. Be-
cause of these concerns, buyers will often develop reverse pricing models that provide es-
timates of the supplier&rsquo;s cost structure during the initial supplier evaluation.
</p>
<p>Total Quality Performance, Systems, and Philosophy
A major part of the evaluation process addresses a supplier&rsquo;s quality management
</p>
<p>processes, systems, and philosophy. Buyers evaluate not only the obvious topics associ-
ated with supplier quality (management commitment, statistical process control, de-
fects) but also safety, training, and facilities and equipment maintenance. Alcoa
defines its supplier quality requirements in four broad areas: management, quality
measurement, safety and training, and facilities. Many purchasers are expecting poten-
tial suppliers to have adopted quality systems based on the Malcolm Baldrige Na-
tional Quality Award (MBNQA) or International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) 9000 criteria. The wide distribution of these guidelines has exposed many sup-
pliers to the Baldrige and ISO definitions of quality.
</p>
<p>Process and Technological Capability
Supplier evaluation teams often include a member from the engineering or techni-
</p>
<p>cal staff to evaluate a supplier&rsquo;s process and technological capability. Process consists
of the technology, design, methods, and equipment used to manufacture a product or
deliver a service. A supplier&rsquo;s selection of a production process helps define its re-
quired technology, human resource skills, and capital equipment requirements.
</p>
<p>The evaluation should include both the supplier&rsquo;s current and future process and
technological capabilities. Assessing a supplier&rsquo;s future process and technological
capability involves reviewing capital equipment plans and strategy. In addition, a pur-
chaser should evaluate the resources that a supplier is committing to research and
development.
</p>
<p>A purchaser may also assess a supplier&rsquo;s design capability. One way to reduce the
time required to develop new products involves using qualified suppliers that are able
to support product design activities. The trend toward the increased use of supplier
design capabilities makes this area an integral part of the supplier evaluation and selec-
tion process.
</p>
<p>Environmental Regulation Compliance
The 1990s brought about a renewed awareness of the impact that industry has on
</p>
<p>the environment. The Clean Air Act of 1990, for example, imposes large fines on pro-
ducers of ozone-depleting substances and foul-smelling gases. Recycling of industrial
materials is also an issue. Purchasers certainly do not want to be associated with
known environmental polluters from a public relations or potential liability standpoint.
</p>
<p>The most common environmental performance criteria used when evaluating a
supplier&rsquo;s performance include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Disclosure of environmental infractions
</p>
<p>&bull; Hazardous and toxic waste management

<p>Herman Miller, a manufacturer of office furniture, makes environmental concerns
part of the supplier evaluation and selection process. For instance, Herman Miller in-
cludes supplier packaging as an evaluation criterion. Standardized, reusable shipping
containers are favored over disposable ones. Such containers also support just-in-
time deliveries. Herman Miller also requires its suppliers to label the chemical compo-
sition of its plastic procured items so that recyclers will know the exact content of
the plastic found in the parts.3 DuPont&rsquo;s environmental program began with cutting
greenhouse gas emissions at its factories by 72% since 1990, an initiative that saved
$3 billion in energy costs. Now DuPont views the environmental movement as a key
to increasing revenue.4
</p>
<p>Financial Stability
An assessment of a potential supplier&rsquo;s financial condition should occur during
</p>
<p>the initial evaluation process. Some purchasers view the financial assessment as a
screening process or preliminary condition that the supplier must pass before a de-
tailed evaluation can begin. An organization may use a financial rating service to
help analyze a supplier&rsquo;s financial condition.
</p>
<p>Selecting a supplier in poor financial condition presents a number of risks. First,
there is the risk that the supplier will go out of business. Second, suppliers that are in
poor financial condition may not have the resources to invest in plant, equipment, or
research that is necessary for longer-term technological or other performance im-
provements. Third, the supplier may become too financially dependent on the pur-
chaser. A final risk is that financial weakness is usually an indication of underlying
problems. Is the weakness a result of poor quality or delivery performance? Is it a re-
sult of wasteful spending by management? Has the supplier assumed too much debt?
</p>
<p>There may be circumstances that support selecting a supplier in a weaker financial
condition. A supplier may be developing but has not yet marketed a leading-edge tech-
nology that can provide an advantage to the purchaser. A supplier may also be in a
weaker financial condition because of uncontrollable or nonrepeating circumstances.
</p>
<p>If the supplier is publicly traded, specific financial ratios can be obtained from a va-
riety of websites providing detailed financial ratios and industry averages to compare
these ratios against. Some common ratios used to assess supplier financial health ap-
pear in Exhibit 7.4.
</p>
<p>Some websites available to obtain such information include the following:

<p>purchasing managers should track such ratios for possible red flags that may signify
potential financial difficulty.
</p>
<p>Production Scheduling and Control Systems
Production scheduling includes those systems that release, schedule, and control a
</p>
<p>supplier&rsquo;s production process. Does the supplier use material requirements planning
(MRP) to ensure the availability of required components? Does the supplier track ma-
terial and production cycle time and compare this against a performance objective or
standard? Does the supplier&rsquo;s production scheduling system support a purchaser&rsquo;s
just-in-time requirements? What lead time does the supplier&rsquo;s production scheduling
and control system require? What is the supplier&rsquo;s on-time delivery performance his-
tory? The purpose behind evaluating the production scheduling and control system is
to identify the degree of control the supplier has over its scheduling and production
process.
</p>
<p>Suppliers can formally claim to have a Class A production system once they have
undergone a formal review of their system by a professional external reviewer who
has verified that the requisite criteria are satisfied. Companies that are considering
sourcing high volumes of product with a supplier will also want to consider whether
the supplier has adequate capacity.

<p>Exhibit 7.4 Interpreting Key Financial Ratios
</p>
<p>RATIOS INTERPRETATION
</p>
<p>LIQUIDITY
</p>
<p>Current ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities Should be over 1.0, but look at industry average; high&mdash;may mean poor asset
management.
</p>
<p>Quick ratio = (Cash + Receivables)/Current liabilities At least 0.8 if supplier sells on credit; low&mdash;may mean cash flow problems; high&mdash;
may mean poor asset management.
</p>
<p>Note: Calculation includes marketable securities
</p>
<p>ACTIVITY
</p>
<p>Inventory turnover = Costs of goods sold/Inventory Compare industry average; low&mdash;problems with slow inventory, which may hurt cash
flow.
</p>
<p>Fixed asset turnover = Sales/Fixed assets Compare industry average; too low may mean supplier is not using fixed assets
efficiently or effectively.
</p>
<p>Total asset turnover = Sales/Total assets Compare industry average; too low may mean supplier is not using its total assets
efficiently or effectively.
</p>
<p>Days sales outstanding = (Receivables &times; 365)/Sales Compare industry average, or a value of 45&ndash;50 if company sells on net 30; too high
hurts cash flow; too low may mean credit policies to customers are too restrictive.
</p>
<p>PROFITABILITY
</p>
<p>Net profit margin = Profit after taxes/Sales Represents after-tax return; compare industry average.
</p>
<p>Return on assets = Profit after taxes/Total assets Compare industry average; represents the return the company earns on everything it
owns.
</p>
<p>Return on equity = Profit after taxes/Equity The higher the better; the return on the shareholders&rsquo; investment in the business.
</p>
<p>DEBT
</p>
<p>Debt to equity = Total liabilities/Equity Compare industry average; over 3 means highly leveraged.
</p>
<p>Current debt to equity = Current liabilities/Equity Over 1 is risky unless industry average is over 1; when ratio is high, supplier may be
unable to pay lenders.
</p>
<p>Interest coverage = (Pretax Inc. + Int. Exp.)/Int. Exp. Should be over 3; higher is better; low may mean supplier is having difficulty paying
creditors.

<p>E-Commerce Capability
The ability to communicate electronically between a buyer and seller is fast becom-
</p>
<p>ing a requirement during supplier selection. In the past, many considered electronic
data interchange (EDI) a primary condition for doing business. However, more and
more companies are moving to web-based business to business (B2B) platforms for
their transactions. In early 2000, relatively few companies had implemented B2B elec-
tronic commerce platforms, but the rate of technology change in this area has now es-
calated rapidly.
</p>
<p>IBM now states that the majority of its purchases (by dollar spent) occur via the In-
ternet. However, such statements entail that suppliers have the required ability to
adopt an e-commerce approach. In contrast to EDI, electronic commerce requires a
relatively low investment on the part of suppliers. Besides the efficiencies that B2B
e-commerce provides, these systems support closer relationships and the exchange of
all kinds of information.
</p>
<p>Purchasing managers should also evaluate other dimensions of the supplier&rsquo;s infor-
mation technology (IT). Does the supplier have computer-aided design (CAD) capa-
bility? Does the supplier have bar coding capability or the ability to use radio
frequency identification tags? Can the supplier send advance-shipping notices or ac-
cept payment by electronic funds transfer? Is the supplier able to communicate via
e-mail? Evidence that the supplier is using these technologies can provide reasonable
assurance that the supplier is current with e-commerce technologies.
</p>
<p>Supplier&rsquo;s Sourcing Strategies, Policies,
and Techniques
</p>
<p>The concept of understanding a supplier&rsquo;s suppliers is part of integrated supply
chain management. Unfortunately, organizations do not have the resources or person-
nel to investigate all of the suppliers within their supply chain. However, there are
ways to obtain information on the performance capabilities of Tier 2 and even Tier 3
suppliers.
</p>
<p>It is possible for a purchaser to develop an understanding of the purchasing ap-
proaches and techniques of suppliers that are three tiers or levels from the primary
buyer. Assume that during the supplier selection process, a purchaser evaluates the
sourcing strategies, approaches, and techniques of its first-tier supplier. Through dis-
cussions with the purchasing department of the first-tier supplier, the purchaser can
gain insight about its second-tier suppliers. If the first-tier supplier also evaluates the
sourcing strategies, approaches, and techniques of its first-tier suppliers (second-tier
suppliers to the purchaser), then this can provide information about third-tier suppli-
ers. Evaluating a potential supplier&rsquo;s sourcing strategies, approaches, and techniques
is one way to gain greater insight and understanding of the supply chain. Because
few purchasers understand their second- and third-tier suppliers, those that do can
gain an important advantage over competitors.
</p>
<p>Longer-Term Relationship Potential
A supplier&rsquo;s willingness to move beyond a traditional purchasing relationship
</p>
<p>should be part of the evaluation process for items and services where a longer-term re-
lationship might be beneficial. Robert Spekman presented a number of questions that

<p>254 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>a buyer should ask when evaluating the potential of a longer-term relationship.5 He ar-
gued that approaches emphasizing supplier efficiency, quality, price, and delivery are
sometimes incomplete. Although these areas are important, they do not necessarily
cover the issues upon which to base a longer-term relationship. Consider the follow-
ing questions when evaluating the longer-term relationship potential of a prospective
supplier:
</p>
<p>&bull; Has the supplier indicated a willingness or commitment to a longer-term
relationship?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the supplier willing to commit resources specific to this relationship?
</p>
<p>&bull; How early in the product design stage is the supplier willing or able to
participate?
</p>
<p>&bull; What does the supplier bring that is unique?
</p>
<p>&bull; Does the supplier have an interest in joint problem solving and improve-
ment efforts?
</p>
<p>&bull; Will there be free and open exchange of information across the two
companies?
</p>
<p>&bull; How much future planning is the supplier willing to share?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the need for confidential treatment of information taken seriously?
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the general level of comfort between the two parties?
</p>
<p>&bull; How well does the supplier know our industry and business?
</p>
<p>&bull; Will the supplier share cost data?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the supplier willing to come to us first with innovations?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the supplier willing to commit capacity exclusively to our needs?
</p>
<p>&bull; What will be the supplier&rsquo;s commitment to understanding our problems and
concerns?
</p>
<p>Although this is not a complete list of questions when evaluating the possibility of
a longer-term relationship, it does provide a framework regarding the types of issues
that are important. It is relatively straightforward to create a numerical scale to assess
these questions as part of the supplier evaluation and selection process.
</p>
<p>Developing a Supplier Evaluation
and Selection Survey
</p>
<p>Supplier evaluation often follows a rigorous, structured approach using formal sur-
veys. An effective supplier survey should have certain characteristics. First, the survey
should be comprehensive and include the performance categories considered impor-
tant to the evaluation and selection process. Second, the survey process should be as
objective as possible. This requires the use of a scoring system that defines the mean-
ing of each value on a measurement scale.
</p>
<p>A third characteristic is that the items and the measurement scales are reliable.
This refers to the degree to which different individuals or groups reviewing the same
items and measurement scales will arrive at the same conclusion. Reliable evaluations
require well-defined measures and well-understood items.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A fourth characteristic of a sound supplier survey is flexibility. Although an organi-
zation should maintain a structure to its supplier survey, the format of the evaluation
should provide some flexibility across different types of purchase requirements. The
easiest way to make the process flexible is to adjust the performance categories and
weights assigned to each category. The most important categories will receive a
higher weight within the total evaluation score.
</p>
<p>A final characteristic of an effective survey is that it is mathematically straightfor-
ward. The use of weights and points should be simple enough that each individual in-
volved in the evaluation understands the mechanics of the scoring and selection
process. To ensure that a supplier survey has the right characteristics, we recommend
the use of a step-by-step process when creating this tool. Exhibit 7.5 presents the
steps to follow when developing such a system. The following section discusses this
framework and develops a sample evaluation survey.
</p>
<p>Step 1: Identify Supplier Evaluation Categories
Perhaps the first step when developing a supplier survey is deciding the categories
</p>
<p>to include. As discussed earlier, there are many evaluation categories. For illustrative
purposes, assume that a purchaser selects quality, management capability, financial
condition, supplier cost structure, expected delivery performance, technological capa-
bility, systems capability, and a general category of miscellaneous performance fac-
tors as the categories to include in the evaluation. These categories would reveal the
performance areas that the purchaser considers most important.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Step 2: Assign a Weight to Each Evaluation Category
The performance categories usually receive a weight that reflects the relative impor-
</p>
<p>tance of that category. The assigned weights reflect the relative importance of each cat-
egory. The total of the combined weights must equal 1.0.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 7.6 shows the weight assigned to each selected performance category in
our sample survey. Notice that the quality systems category receives 20% of the total
evaluation, whereas systems capability receives 5%; this simply reflects the difference
in relative importance to the purchaser between the two performance categories. Re-
call that an important characteristic of an effective evaluation system is flexibility.
One way that management achieves this flexibility is by assigning different weights or
adding or deleting performance categories as required.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Step 3: Identify and Weigh Subcategories
Step 2 specified broad performance categories included within our sample evalua-
</p>
<p>tion. Step 3 of this process requires identifying any performance subcategories, if
they exist, within each broader performance category. For example, the quality sys-
tems category may require the identification of separate subcategories (such as those
described in the Malcolm Baldrige Award criteria). If this is the case, the supplier eval-
uation should include any subcategories or items that make up the quality systems
category.
</p>
<p>Equally important, the purchaser must decide how to weigh each subcategory
within the broader performance evaluation category. In Exhibit 7.6, the quality cate-
gory includes an evaluation of a supplier&rsquo;s process control systems, total quality com-
mitment, and parts per million (ppm) defects performance. The sum of the
subcategory weights must equal the total weight of the performance category. Further-
more, the purchaser must clearly define the scoring system used within each cate-
gory. This becomes the focus of Step 4.
</p>
<p>Step 4: Define a Scoring System for Categories
and Subcategories
</p>
<p>Step 4 defines each score within a performance category. If an evaluation uses a
5-point scale to assess a performance category, then a purchaser must clearly define
the difference between a score of 5, 4, 3, and so on. One important point is to de-
velop a scale that clearly defines what a specific score means. For example, it is better
to use a 4-point scale that is easier to interpret and is based on the language and prin-
ciples of total quality management than a 10-point scale where 1&ndash;2 = poor, 3&ndash;4 =
weak, 5&ndash;6 = marginal, 7&ndash;8 = qualified, and 9&ndash;10 = outstanding. The scoring values
on the 10-point scale do not have descriptive definitions detailing the difference be-
tween a 1 and a 2 or a 3 and a 4, for example. A more specific way is shown in the
4-point scale below:
</p>
<p>&bull; Major nonconformity (0 points earned): The absence or total breakdown of
a system to meet a requirement, or any noncompliance that would result in
the probable shipment of a nonconforming product.
</p>
<p>&bull; Minor nonconformity (1 point earned): A noncompliance (though not ma-
jor) that judgment and experience indicate is likely to result in the failure of
the quality system or reduce its ability to ensure controlled processes or
products.
</p>
<p>&bull; Conformity (2 points earned): No major or minor nonconformities were
noted during the evaluation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Adequacy (3 points earned): Specific supplier performance or documenta-
tion meets or exceeds requirements given the scope of the supplier&rsquo;s
operations.
</p>
<p>A well-defined scoring system takes criteria that may be highly subjective and de-
velops a quantitative scale for measurement. Effective metrics allow different in-
dividuals to interpret and score similarly the same performance categories under
review. A scoring system that is too broad, ambiguous, or poorly defined increases
the probability of arriving at widely different assessments or conclusions.S

<p>Step 5: Evaluate Supplier Directly
This step requires that the reviewer visit a supplier&rsquo;s facilities to perform the evalua-
</p>
<p>tion. Site visits require at least a day and often several days to complete. When factor-
ing in travel time and postvisit reviews, we begin to realize that an organization
must carefully select those suppliers it plans on evaluating. In many cases, a cross-
functional team will perform the evaluation, which allows team members with differ-
ent knowledge to ask different questions.
</p>
<p>Purchasers often notify suppliers beforehand of any documentation required dur-
ing the initial evaluation. For example, if a purchaser has no previous experience
with a supplier, the reviewer might require a supplier to provide documentation of
performance capability. The supplier will have to present evidence of process capabil-
ity studies, process control systems, or delivery performance.
</p>
<p>The following explains the calculation for the quality category in Exhibit 7.6: Qual-
ity Systems Performance Category (Weight = 20% of total evaluation).
</p>
<p>Subcategories are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Process control systems (4 points out of 5 possible points equals 80%) or 0.8
&times; 5 sub-weight = 4.0 points
</p>
<p>&bull; Total quality commitment (4 points out of 5 possible points) = 0.8 &times; 8 sub-
weight = 6.4 points
</p>
<p>&bull; PPM defect performance (5 points out of 5 possible points) = 1.0 &times; 7 sub-
weight = 7.0 points
</p>
<p>&bull; Total for category = 17.4 points or 87% of total possible points (17.4/20)
</p>
<p>As shown in Exhibit 7.6, Advanced Micro Systems received a total overall evalua-
tion of 80.6%. A purchaser can objectively compare the scores of different suppliers
competing for the same purchase contract or select one supplier over another based
on the evaluation score. It is also possible that a supplier does not qualify at this time
for further purchase consideration. Purchasers should have minimum acceptable per-
formance requirements that suppliers must satisfy before they can become part of the
supply base. In this example, the supplier performs acceptably in most major catego-
ries except delivery performance (9 out of 15 possible points). The reviewer must de-
cide if the shortcomings in this category are correctable or if the supplier simply
lacks the ability to perform.
</p>
<p>Step 6: Review Evaluation Results and Make
Selection Decision
</p>
<p>At some point, a reviewer must decide whether to recommend or reject a supplier
as a source. A purchaser may review a supplier for consideration for expected future
business and not a specific contract. Evaluating suppliers before there is an actual pur-
chase requirement can provide a great deal of flexibility to a purchaser. Once an ac-
tual need materializes, the purchaser is in a position to move quickly because it has
prequalified the supplier.
</p>
<p>It is important to determine the seriousness of any supplier shortcomings noted
during the evaluation and assess the degree to which these shortcomings might affect
performance. Evaluation scales should differentiate between various degrees of sup-
plier shortcomings. Alcoa, for example, explicitly defines the difference between a
performance problem and a deficiency. A performance problem is &ldquo;a discrepancy,

<p>The primary output from this step is a recommendation about whether to accept
a supplier for a purchase contract. Exhibit 7.7 illustrates a simple recommendation

portant outcome from any evaluation is the identification of improvement opportu-
nities on the part of the supplier.

<p>260 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A purchaser may evaluate several suppliers that might be competing for the same
contract. The initial evaluation provides an objective way to compare suppliers side-
by-side before making a final selection decision. A purchaser may decide to use more
than one supplier based on the results of the supplier survey.
</p>
<p>The authority to decide the final selection varies from organization to organiza-
tion. The reviewer or team who evaluated the supplier may have the authority to
make the supplier selection decision. In other cases, the buyer or team may present
or justify the supplier selection decision or findings to a committee or a manager
who has final authority.
</p>
<p>Step 7: Review and Improve Supplier Performance
Continuously
</p>
<p>The supplier survey or visit is only the first step of the evaluation process. If a pur-
chaser decides to select a supplier, the supplier must then perform according to the
purchaser&rsquo;s requirements. The emphasis shifts from the initial evaluation and selec-
tion of suppliers to evidence of continuous performance improvement by suppliers.
Chapter 9 addresses the management of a world-class supply base.
</p>
<p>Supplier Selection
Some important issues arise during the supplier evaluation and selection process.
</p>
<p>Each has the potential to affect the final decision.
</p>
<p>Critical Issues
</p>
<p>Size Relationship
A purchaser may decide to select suppliers over which it has a relative size advan-
</p>
<p>tage. A buyer may simply have greater influence when it has a relative size advantage
over the supplier or represents a larger share of the supplier&rsquo;s total business. For exam-
ple, Allen-Edmonds Shoe Corporation, a 71-year-old maker of premium shoes, tried
unsuccessfully to implement just-in-time methods to speed production, boost cus-
tomer satisfaction, and save money. Unfortunately, Allen-Edmonds had difficulty get-
ting suppliers to agree to the just-in-time requirement of matching delivery to
production needs. Although domestic suppliers of leather soles agreed to make
weekly instead of monthly deliveries, European tanneries supplying calfskin hides re-
fused to cooperate. The reason? Allen-Edmonds was not a large enough customer to
wield any leverage with those suppliers.
</p>
<p>Use of International Suppliers
The decision to select a foreign supplier can have important implications during
</p>
<p>the supplier evaluation and selection process. For one, international sourcing is gener-
ally more complex than domestic buying. As a result, the evaluation and selection pro-
cess can take on added complexity. It may be difficult to implement JIT with
international suppliers, as lead times are frequently twice or even three times as long
as lead times for domestic suppliers. S

</p>
<p>Chapter 7 Supplier Evaluation and Selection 261</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Competitors as Suppliers
Another important issue is the degree to which a buyer is willing to purchase di-
</p>
<p>rectly from a competitor. Purchasing from competitors may limit information shar-
ing between the parties. The purchase transaction is usually straightforward and the
buyer and seller may not develop a working relationship characterized by mutual com-
mitment and confidential information sharing.
</p>
<p>Countertrade Requirements
The need to satisfy countertrade requirements can also affect the supplier selec-
</p>
<p>tion decision. Countertrade is a broad term that refers to all trade where buyer and
seller have at least a partial exchange of goods for goods. (See Chapter 10 for addi-
tional discussion.)
</p>
<p>Boeing, a producer of commercial aircraft, purchases a portion of its production re-
quirements in markets where it hopes to do business. An organization involved in ex-
tensive worldwide marketing may have to contend with countertrade requirements
before it can sell to international customers, which can have a direct impact on the
supplier evaluation and selection process. Chapter 10 addresses international purchas-
ing and countertrade.
</p>
<p>Social Objectives
Most purchasers are attempting to increase their business with traditionally disad-
</p>
<p>vantaged suppliers, including suppliers with female, minority, or handicapped own-
ers. Buyers may also want to conduct business with suppliers that commit to the
highest environmental standards. The influence of social objectives on purchasing
will continue to remain strong.
</p>
<p>Reducing Supplier Evaluation and Selection
Cycle Time
</p>
<p>Across almost all business applications, competitive and customer pressures are
forcing reductions in the time it takes to perform a task or carry out a process. These
pressures are also affecting the time available to evaluate and select suppliers. Purchas-
ing must increasingly be proactive and anticipate supplier selection requirements
rather than react when a need arises.
</p>
<p>Although supplier selection decisions come about for different reasons, many im-
portant selection decisions come about as part of the product development process.
Consider the cycle time changes that the U.S. automotive industry continues to experi-
ence. In the middle of the 1980s, GM, Ford, and Chrysler required 60 months to de-
sign and bring a new car or truck to market. During the early 1990s, the benchmark
for development time (sometimes referred to as concept-to-customer, or CTC, cycle
time) became 48 months. By the mid-1990s world-class producers were aiming for de-
velopment times of 36 months.
</p>
<p>From the 1980s to 2003, product development cycle times changed from 60 months
to a new target of 18 months, or a reduction of 70%! In many industries, development
times are shortening by 30&ndash;50% every five years. Processes that support new-product de-
velopment, such as supplier evaluation and selection, must also shorten accordingly.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Tools and Approaches
Most managers do not even challenge the need to reduce the time it takes to evalu-
</p>
<p>ate and select suppliers. The challenge is one of shortening the process while still arriv-
ing at effective decisions. Fortunately, supply managers have many tools and
approaches available to help them shorten the selection cycle time. Although dozens
of activities can help shorten selection time, the following presents a set of powerful
ways to reduce selection time.
</p>
<p>Map the Current Supplier Evaluation and Selection Process
Process mapping involves the identification of the steps, activities, time, and costs
</p>
<p>involved in a process. Once we understand the current evaluation and selection
process, opportunities for improvement should become evident. Supply managers
should measure process cycle times to identify rates of improvement against pre-
established performance targets. Process mapping should be the first step in the
improvement process.
</p>
<p>Integrate with Internal Customers
The need to anticipate rather than react to supplier evaluation and selection deci-
</p>
<p>sions requires closer involvement with internal customers, which can be achieved in
a variety of ways. Purchasing can co-locate physically with marketing, engineering,
and operations to gain early insight into expected supply requirements. Involvement
on new-product development teams is also an ideal way to integrate with internal cus-
tomers. Allowing internal customers to forward their requirements to purchasing, per-
haps through an online requisition system, can also be an effective way to integrate
with internal customers, particularly for routine purchase requirements.
</p>
<p>Data Warehouse with Supplier Information
A data warehouse consists of easy-to-access supplier data and information. The data
</p>
<p>warehouse can include information about potential suppliers, performance history of
current suppliers, details of current contracts, expiration dates of supply contracts, ex-
pected forecasts for purchased items, and any other information that supports a faster
selection process.
</p>
<p>Third-Party Support
The Good Practice Example following this section highlights the use of a third or
</p>
<p>external party to provide supplier data, which can significantly reduce time and ef-
fort. Another third-party source is Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which provides financial ratio
data, the business background of supplier management, payment trends, and an over-
all supplier risk score. The Internet is also a source of third-party supplier informa-
tion, including online directories of potential suppliers.
</p>
<p>New Organizational Design Features
Commodity teams have become a popular way to manage important purchase re-
</p>
<p>quirements. These teams are responsible for understanding in depth entire families or
groups of purchased goods and services. The teams are usually responsible for achiev-
ing improvements within their commodity, which may involve site visits to evaluate
suppliers. Some companies also use a lead buyer model as part of their organizational
design. An individual at a site or location is responsible for owning and managing a

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>purchased item. The lead buyer usually manages items that are not critical enough for
a commodity team to manage.
</p>
<p>Preferred Supplier List
Many firms create a list of their highest-performing suppliers. These suppliers
</p>
<p>earn their place on a preferred supplier list by consistently providing the best services
and products to the buyer. A preferred supplier list can provide dramatic reductions
in selection time because a buyer already knows the best suppliers to consider.
</p>
<p>Electronic Tools
IT providers have developed a host of electronic tools to improve the evaluation
</p>
<p>and selection process:7
</p>
<p>&bull; E-Learning Scorecard is a tool to use during first-time visits with suppliers
to make a quick &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo; decision about the possibility of using the sup-
plier. The tool requires the user to rank various criteria among suppliers.8
</p>
<p>&bull; Special Edition is a microsite developed by Northern Light Technology.
This tool provides current news and information, as well as Internet links to
leading supplier information.9
</p>
<p>&bull; RFP Version 2.0, developed by eBreviate, is a web-based software package
that enables companies to develop customized online supplier surveys and
proposal requests. A buyer can establish simultaneous communication with
multiple potential suppliers, which allows users to evaluate and quantify dis-
cussions with potential suppliers in an online auction format.10
</p>
<p>&bull; Decision Analysis, developed by Kepner-Tregoe of Princeton, NJ, is a widely
used supplier evaluation and selection process that uses a weighted-point sys-
tem. This tool is part of Kepner-Tregoe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Problem Solving and Decision
Making&rdquo; series.11
</p>
<p>&bull; SPEX evaluation kits use a four-step process that consists of industry analy-
sis and project formalization, definition of projects, examining responses to
key requirements, and evaluation and selection of suppliers.12
</p>
<p>Predefined Contract Language and Shorter Contracts
Most contracts address areas that are similar. Progressive supply managers work
</p>
<p>with their legal group to develop pre-established contract language that can be cut
and pasted during a supplier negotiation. The role of the legal department is to re-
view and initial any changes from the pre-established language or approve areas the
standard language does not cover. Progressive firms are also working to shorten the
length of their contracts.

<p>pany in our markets through supply chain performance,&rdquo; he told the attendees. &ldquo;Have the
right ethics and the right business practices and you&rsquo;ll attract the best people and suppliers
who&rsquo;ll produce the best results,&rdquo; Cutler said.
</p>
<p>With that ethos as their foundation, Eaton&rsquo;s vice president for supply chain management
Rick Jacobs and the 3,500-strong supply chain team examine suppliers&rsquo; ethics and business
practices as closely as they look at their product quality, core competencies, and potential
for value creation. The company has an ombudsman for ethics whom employees or anyone
else can confer with. And Eaton doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to stop doing business with suppliers whose
business practices aren&rsquo;t up to its own high standards, regardless of their quality or prices.
Eaton believes in working collaboratively with the key suppliers that make the cut and are
selected for business. Eaton&rsquo;s supply chain team has given birth to a variety of strategic in-
itiatives that support its supply selection and management process. Among the initiatives
are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; A supply chain data warehouse that integrates data from the company&rsquo;s myriad
ERP systems to create a single repository of critical data for decision making. Its
genesis was a shared service center that the supply chain organization initiated
with the company&rsquo;s finance group. &ldquo;But it only contained financial data, and we
knew we needed much more, such as information on quality, logistics, non-
purchase-order data, and other items so we could more effectively manage spend
and monitor suppliers,&rdquo; Jacobs said.
</p>
<p>&bull; Significant progress toward the corporate goal of reducing the supply base by
50% by 2010.
</p>
<p>&bull; A 50% reduction in the number of incoming parts defects over the last three
years, in part by eliminating poor-performing suppliers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Major savings and improved cross-functional communication from the work of spe-
cial hub-and-spoke commodity teams composed of supply chain representatives
from each of Eaton&rsquo;s business groups. Each team develops commodity strategies
that integrate supply chain and business strategies. On each team, the hub is
the business group with the highest dollar purchases in the commodity. The
spokes are the remaining businesses. The electronics team, for one, reduced its
supplier base from 127 to just 5 key distributors and has achieved 12% annual-
ized savings so far.
</p>
<p>&bull; A 10% per-year savings in North American small-package logistics from moving
95% of shipments through a single provider. Partnering with five lead logistics
suppliers across the globe for raw materials and finished goods shipments has
led to 6% savings per year since 2005.
</p>
<p>&bull; Globalization of the indirect buy, including MRO, capital equipment, energy, infor-
mation technology, telecom, and fleet services.
</p>
<p>&bull; Development of special software tools for improving communication with suppli-
ers and other Eaton functional business groups. One, Worldwide Interactive Sup-
plier Performance Evaluation Resource (WISPER), helps the supply chain team
manage and evaluate suppliers. Another, Supplier Visualization, gives suppliers
visibility into purchase orders, forecasts, and inventory so they can appropriately
manage Eaton&rsquo;s inventory.
</p>
<p>&bull; Development and implementation of a state-of-the-art training initiative&mdash;called
the Supply Chain Functional Excellence Program&mdash;that helps supply chain staff
improve their knowledge and skills and prepare for advancement within the
company.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>EXHAUSTIVE SUPPLIER QUALIFICATION AND COORDINATION
All those and other successes begin with Eaton&rsquo;s rigorous process to find suppliers whose
business practices match their own. For an idea of how rigorously Eaton analyzes the quality,
fitness, and potential of prospective suppliers, talk to Jon Barfield, CEO and president of the
Bartech Group. The Livonia, MI&ndash;based minority supplier finds and manages all of the com-
pany&rsquo;s temporary help. &ldquo;We had discussions and did testing for the better part of a year be-
fore they decided to go with us,&rdquo; says Barfield, who calls his company&rsquo;s relationship with
Eaton one of the best of all his customers.
</p>
<p>Or talk to Gregg Hammer, national accounts manager for Pratt Industries in Conyers, GA, a
supplier of corrugated containers. &ldquo;They are very meticulous about analyzing suppliers&rsquo; busi-
ness practices, more so than most others,&rdquo; says Hammer. &ldquo;Environmentalism is one of their
big pushes, and they talked with us about that and our own views on ethics.&rdquo; In fact, Ham-
mer believes Pratt&rsquo;s &ldquo;green&rdquo; practices&mdash;the fact that their products are 100% recyclable&mdash;
was a big reason that Eaton increased its business with them.
</p>
<p>Sourcing teams develop a single commodity strategy that integrates supply chain and busi-
ness strategy. Among other things, the teams act as clearinghouses for information and com-
munication, and for resolving supplier problems. For example, two business units located in
the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were using the same supplier for custom electron-
ics and electrical assemblies. The supplier was producing these assemblies at several of its
plants in Hungary and Bulgaria.
</p>
<p>Because of timing differences at the two Eaton business units, the production ramp-up
started at an earlier date for the U.K. sites than for those in the Netherlands. As a result,
the individual business units signed separate supplier agreements that included differing per-
formance parameters for the relationship. That, of course, inevitably led to different perfor-
mance expectations and communication issues. Because both business units were part of
the electronics hub-and-spoke team, they eventually found a way to jointly set performance
parameters by completing a single supply agreement with the supplier and standardizing on
communication and performance. Supplier performance improved and the team agreed to con-
sider giving more business to the supplier.
</p>
<p>Eaton&rsquo;s hub-and-spoke commodities teams integrate commodity and business strategies.
Here are some of the savings the teams have realized:
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronics team: Consolidated 127 suppliers into 5 key distributor partners. Annu-
alized cost savings of 12%.
</p>
<p>&bull; Plastics team: Consolidated the resin-distribution base from 10 suppliers to 1 sup-
plier. Savings of 5%.
</p>
<p>&bull; Packaging team: Consolidated 175 suppliers to 1 supplier. Savings of 12%.
&bull; Raw materials team: Leveraged low spend ($5 million) in one group and $100 mil-
</p>
<p>lion in another group. For a similar product, saved more than 10% on the low-
spend portion.
</p>
<p>COLLABORATION IS KEY
Besides ethics, quality, and environmentally sound practices, the willingness to collaborate is
critical in Eaton&rsquo;s evaluation of suppliers. Within the company&rsquo;s own walls, Jacobs and his
team collaborate with virtually every function in the company, including finance, information
technology, human resources, legal, and ethics, boosting the supply chain organization&rsquo;s im-
age and influence internally, as well as its value. For example, representatives from product
engineering, accounting, and other functions brainstorm strategies with supply chainS

<p>personnel on the hub-and-spoke commodity teams. Additionally, supply chain staff are work-
ing closely with finance and information technology to develop a system to completely digi-
tize invoicing.
</p>
<p>Externally, the supply chain team facilitates collaboration between Eaton&rsquo;s engineering staff
and its customers to solve design problems. Case in point: the Eaton Automotive Division&rsquo;s
work on a supercharger for the Cadillac Northstar. Superchargers are positive-displacement
devices that add power and efficiency to car engines. But they have to fit within a very tight
space, and the design envelope often changes. Despite the changes, Eaton&rsquo;s task was to
hold to its quote.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could only get our costs down so much through negotiations,&rdquo; says Jeff Place, director
of supply chain management for the Automotive Group. So, Place and his team sat Eaton en-
gineers down with the customer&rsquo;s engineers and the suppliers of the various components of
the supercharger. Together, they identified the individual cost drivers for each component, con-
sidered the possibility of unnecessary tolerances, and identified opportunities to cut costs.
&ldquo;We took a product-centric view,&rdquo; Place says, &ldquo;and collaborated with the suppliers to find
the lowest cost.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In another case, the supply chain worked with suppliers of a DC motor to get the cost down.
Again, the supply chain formed a team with members from engineering, staff from
manufacturing, and representatives of the suppliers to identify the key cost drivers. Result:
They achieved double-digit cost reductions.
</p>
<p>THE SEARCH FOR INNOVATION
And you can&rsquo;t be successful without innovation. Like most progressive manufacturers, Eaton
encourages&mdash;indeed, expects&mdash;its suppliers to be innovative. &ldquo;That often requires bringing
them in at the earliest stages of the design process so they&rsquo;ll understand the product bet-
ter,&rdquo; says Mike Bungo, vice president of supply chain and operational excellence. And the sup-
ply chain team will help suppliers succeed, he says, even if it requires bringing in a master
scheduler to adjust delivery dates, or posting Eaton quality engineers and technicians to stra-
tegic-supplier sites for extended periods to guide the suppliers&rsquo; quality efforts.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>CONCLUSION
This chapter discussed one of the most important functions of business&mdash;the evalu-
</p>
<p>ation and selection of suppliers. When a purchaser performs these activities well, it es-
tablishes the foundation upon which to further develop and improve supplier
performance. In his book Purchasing in the 21st Century, John Schorr maintains that
a buyer should look for certain characteristics when evaluating and selecting suppli-
ers. A good supplier does the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Builds quality into the product, aiming for zero-defect production.
</p>
<p>&bull; Makes delivery performance a priority, including a willingness to make
short and frequent deliveries to point-of-use areas at a purchaser&rsquo;s facility.
</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrates responsiveness to a purchaser&rsquo;s needs by ensuring that quali-
fied and accessible people are in charge of servicing the purchaser&rsquo;s account.
</p>
<p>&bull; Works with a purchaser to reduce lead times as much as possible. Long lead
times make it difficult to plan and drive up supply chain costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provides a purchaser with information regarding capability and workload.
</p>
<p>&bull; Creates the future rather than fears the future.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reinvests part of its profits in R&amp;D, takes a long-term view, and is willing to
spend for tomorrow.
</p>
<p>&bull; Meets the stringent financial stability criteria used when evaluating potential
new customers for credit.
</p>
<p>A focus on selecting only the best suppliers possible will make a major contribu-
tion to the competitiveness of the entire organization. The ability to make this contri-
bution requires careful evaluation and selection of the suppliers that provide the
goods and services that help satisfy the needs of an organization&rsquo;s final customers.

<p>Quality Problems Are Not Child&rsquo;s Play
</p>
<p>In the fall of 2007, Mattel and other toy manufacturers and distributors were faced
with a monumental challenge and a public relations nightmare. A number of the toys pur-
chased from low-cost Chinese manufacturers were contaminated with lead paint, a product
that had long since been banned in the United States because of its potential to poison the
children who played with them, possibly leading to learning or behavioral problems. Mattel
identified about 20 million toys worldwide, in three separate recalls, believed to be contami-
nated with lead paint or perhaps containing other possible hazards such as small magnets
that could easily be removed and swallowed by a child.
</p>
<p>Like many companies in other industries, these companies had outsourced much of their
manufacturing requirements to lower-cost offshore suppliers. USA Today reported that some
of the suspect Mattel toys had lead content calculated at 110,000 parts per million, or 180
times the U.S. legal level. In Mattel&rsquo;s case, its long-term Hong Kong&ndash;based supplier had sub-
contracted to another company, which did not use Mattel-approved paint.
</p>
<p>Toymakers report that approximately 80% of their imported toys are now made in China,
which makes it difficult for consumers to find other alternatives. Due to the public outcry,
the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a U.S. federal agency, expanded its investigation
of lead-based paints in toys to include other imported products, such as ceramic dishes and
cookware from both China and Mexico, as well as various polyvinyl chloride plastic products.
</p>
<p>The results of these incidents are both substantial and far reaching. The owner of one of the
Chinese manufacturing facilities involved committed suicide. Mattel named a senior execu-
tive to head its newly founded corporate responsibility unit, which was tasked with oversee-
ing an internal investigation. The U.S. government negotiated a new trade agreement with
the Chinese government that banned future use of lead-based paint and strengthened Chi-
nese regulatory authority (however, local governments within China have a lengthy history of
avoiding national policies when they negatively impact local economies). Additional monitor-
ing from Chinese and U.S. agencies will be needed to ensure that these new laws are com-
plied with. The Walt Disney Company announced that it would begin testing toys featuring
its various Disney-branded characters. Other companies have now started to market home
lead test kits for worried parents. Companies outsourcing a variety of products from China
have begun to co-locate their employees on-site at offshore manufacturing firms instead of
relying solely on periodic third-party audits.
</p>
<p>If we really think about it, were the quality-related problems in this story solely the fault of
Mattel or other companies whose brand names were on the final product? Invariably, the buy-
ers and ultimate users of these unsafe products will blame the final producer and distribu-
tor because, from their perspective, both the producer and distributor share ultimate
responsibility for the safety and usability of the products made and distributed. To be sure,
these problems may be due to poor oversight of suppliers by the distributors. However, exter-
nal suppliers in China provided the toys and other components that were contaminated with
lead paint or had other defects, resulting in multiple recalls and highly negative public per-
ception, a lose-lose proposition for all concerned.
</p>
<p>Are these defects part of a broader challenge to how Mattel and others manage their far-
flung global supply chains? The more dispersed the global supply chain is, the more buying
companies must strive to ensure that quality, safety, and labor standards are upheld. Can
supplier quality, which many firms too often take for granted, affect the customer&rsquo;s percep-
tion of finished products? For Mattel and others, the negative effects are significant. A simi-
lar question is whether Ford Motor Company is a stronger or weaker company now because
of its past problems with Firestone, a (former) long-term supplier of automotive tires.

<p>This chapter approaches supplier quality from several perspectives. The first section
presents a broad overview of supplier quality management. The second section in-
vestigates the various factors that affect supply management&rsquo;s role in managing sup-
plier quality. Next, we present the principles of total quality management and relate
them to supplier quality management. Fourth, we define Six Sigma quality and dis-
cuss how it relates to purchasing and supply chain management. The chapter con-
cludes with a discussion of International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
9000:2000, ISO 14000, and the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA)
criteria and how they can be used to more effectively manage supplier quality.
</p>
<p>Overview of Supplier Quality Management
</p>
<p>What Is Supplier Quality?
Before discussing supplier quality, we should define the generic term &ldquo;quality.&rdquo; One
</p>
<p>renowned quality expert, Armand Feigenbaum, defines quality as the total composite
of product and service characteristics of marketing, engineering, manufacturing, and
maintenance through which the product or service in use will meet or exceed the ex-
pectations of the customer.1 This definition differs from other popular definitions
that typically view quality as primarily conforming to customer requirements. Joseph
Juran, perhaps the foremost expert on quality, defined quality simply as fitness for
use. Philip Crosby, another well-known total quality expert, defined quality as confor-
mance to requirements. In recent years, the concept of quality has changed radically
from meeting customer requirements or expectations to exceeding them.
</p>
<p>The distributors of these unsafe toys focused, perhaps too much, on the design, assembly,
and cost of the finished products. Is it possible that these companies should have directed
more attention to how they managed supplier quality? If we ask typical parents who pur-
chased one or more of these toys, they will quickly share strong feelings about their negative
experiences and the company they hold responsible. And to the detriment of these toy manu-
facturers and distributors, disgruntled customers will quickly share their feelings, as most dis-
satisfied customers will, with anyone else who will listen!
</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens within a producer&rsquo;s own four walls, it is very difficult, if not virtu-
ally impossible, to offer a quality product or service to customers when the inputs received
from its suppliers are flawed. Today&rsquo;s consumers demand products and services that are pro-
vided on time, at the right quality, with the right features, and at the lowest total cost. Pro-
ducers receive minimal forgiveness when they fail to satisfy demanding customer
requirements, regardless of the source of the defects.
</p>
<p>In situations where externally sourced components and subassemblies affect cost, quality, and
product performance, or where suppliers provide value-added activities through design, engineer-
ing, and testing, effective management of supplier quality is a strategic competitive necessity.
Furthermore, any company that is serious about implementing total quality management (TQM)
cannot ignore the important relationship between supplier quality and product quality.

<p>Chapter 8 Supplier Quality Management 273</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Customer expectations are dynamic and constantly shifting. Not surprisingly,
many actions taken by a firm&rsquo;s competitors can change the user&rsquo;s quality expecta-
tions. For example, a customer may be satisfied with three-day package delivery ser-
vice until another company offers two-day service with guaranteed delivery at a
competitive cost. Changes due to competition can quickly and dramatically redefine
the requirements that customers accept as their standard of performance. This sce-
nario actually occurred as UPS announced it was reducing by one day the time it
takes to deliver a package to certain parts of the United States. Its competitors had to
adapt their delivery systems and processes to offer comparable services. The chal-
lenge with customer expectations is the company&rsquo;s ability to specifically define them
and then translate those expectations upstream throughout its supply chain.
</p>
<p>From these quality perspectives, we can begin to define what we mean by supplier
quality. Supplier quality represents the ability to meet or exceed current and future cus-
tomer (i.e., buyer and eventually end customer) expectations or requirements within
critical performance areas on a consistent basis. There are three major parts to this
definition:
</p>
<p>1. Ability to meet or exceed. This means that suppliers satisfy or exceed buyer
expectations or requirements each and every time. Inconsistent supplier perfor-
mance, whether in physical product quality or on-time delivery, is not a char-
acteristic of a quality supplier.
</p>
<p>2. Current and future customer expectations or requirements. Suppliers must
meet or exceed today&rsquo;s demanding requirements while also possessing the abil-
ity to anticipate and satisfy future customer requirements. Suppliers must be
capable of demonstrating continuous performance improvement. A supplier
that can satisfy today&rsquo;s requirements but cannot keep pace with future require-
ments is not a quality supplier.
</p>
<p>3. Within critical performance areas on a consistent basis. Supplier quality does
not apply only to the physical attributes of a product. Quality suppliers satisfy
a buyer&rsquo;s expectations or requirements in many areas, including product or
service delivery, product or service conformance, after-sale support, current
technology and features, and total cost management.
</p>
<p>Within supply chains, supply management does not merely buy parts or services
from suppliers&mdash;it buys (and sometimes must help manage) supplier capabilities that
result in quality products and services. Buyers should focus not only on a supplier&rsquo;s
physical output (the end result), but also on the supporting systems and processes
that create that output. This includes the supplier&rsquo;s expertise and capabilities in logis-
tics, engineering, and managing its own supply chain.
</p>
<p>Part of supply management&rsquo;s role in supplier quality management involves being
a good customer to its suppliers. It is difficult to maintain a trusting and collabora-
tive relationship and receive quality goods and services when suppliers do not enjoy
doing business with the buying company. For this reason, supplier quality perfor-
mance requires that a buyer learn how to become a preferred customer by understand-
ing what suppliers appreciate in a buyer-seller relationship.
</p>
<p>Some of the expectations that suppliers have within a supply chain relationship in-
clude minimizing product design changes once production begins, providing visibility
to future purchase volume requirements, and sharing early access and visibility toS

<p>new product requirements. Suppliers also value adequate production lead time, ethi-
cal treatment from the buyer, and accurate and timely payment of invoices. Buyers
should also strive for negligible changes in purchase orders after sending material re-
leases to suppliers to alleviate supply disruptions.
</p>
<p>A buyer cannot expect the highest levels of supplier performance when the sup-
plier must respond to frequent or short-lead-time changes. Stability allows a supplier
to minimize its costs and effectively plan on the basis of timely and consistent buyer
information. Frequent changes limit a supplier&rsquo;s ability to meet the buyer&rsquo;s expecta-
tions, including quality requirements, in a timely and consistent manner, as well as in-
creasing the supplier&rsquo;s costs. Supply management plays a central role in ensuring that
its suppliers perform in a defect-free manner.
</p>
<p>Why Be Concerned with Supplier Quality?
Lapses in managing supplier quality can tarnish the reputation of even the world&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>best brands. As the opening vignette made clear, any firm that does not effectively
manage quality throughout its supply chain is risking long-term customer dissatisfac-
tion, reduced market share, and increased costs, as well as negative public relations.
</p>
<p>Research continues to reveal that supply managers rate supplier delivery and sup-
plier product and service quality, two important quality indicators, as just above aver-
age (5.09 and 5.13, respectively, where 1 = poor, 4 = average, and 7 = excellent). In
fact, the perception that supply managers have of supplier quality performance has
not changed over the last 10 years.2 Most firms have grown to rely on their suppliers;
the vulnerability that many firms feel toward them, particularly for supplier-
designed product and process technology, makes supplier performance critically im-
portant. It is a competitive necessity to assess actual supplier performance to make
sure it aligns with expected supplier performance.3
</p>
<p>Supplier Impact on Quality
The late quality expert Philip Crosby estimated that suppliers are responsible for
</p>
<p>50% of a firm&rsquo;s product-related quality problems. Furthermore, the average manufac-
turing firm spends more than 55% of its sales dollar on purchased goods and ser-
vices; some manufacturers spend even more, with figures approaching 100%. A firm
that focuses only on its own internal quality issues will usually fail to recognize and
take appropriate action on the true underlying root causes of many quality-related
problems. Poor supplier quality can quickly undermine a firm&rsquo;s total quality improve-
ment effort.
</p>
<p>Continuous-Improvement Requirements
Most firms plan to achieve continuous quality improvements in all aspects of their
</p>
<p>business. One way to do this is through the effective management of supplier quality.
Quality improvement requirements are a function of a company&rsquo;s industry along
with how well its performance compares to that of its competitors. Companies in
high-technology industries, such as Chrysler, Boeing, Intel, and Texas Instruments,
face intense competitive pressure to achieve quality levels that approach perfection.
Other industries, such as furniture making, typically experience a slower and less dra-
matic rate of change. Regardless, all industries experience at least some pressure from
customers to achieve continuous quality improvement.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Outsourcing of Purchase Requirements
Reliance on a firm&rsquo;s suppliers for raw materials, components, subassemblies, and
</p>
<p>even finished products is steadily increasing. It is no longer an advantage in some
industries to make most of the components of a product or to provide their own
services. Therefore, progressive buyers are relying on suppliers that demonstrate sig-
nificant design and build capabilities, even for highly technical or complex part re-
quirements. For example, Dell Computer is primarily an assembly operation that
purchases most of its PC componentry (monitor, hard drive, keyboard, micro-
processors, power unit, and so on) from external suppliers. The larger the proportion
of the final product that suppliers provide, the greater the impact they will have on
overall product cost and quality.
</p>
<p>Factors Affecting Supply Management&rsquo;s Role
in Managing Supplier Quality
</p>
<p>Supply management must assume primary organizational leadership for managing
quality with its external suppliers. A number of factors influence how much attention
supply management should commit to managing supplier quality:
</p>
<p>&bull; The ability of a supplier to affect a buyer&rsquo;s total quality. Certain suppliers
will provide items that are highly critical to a firm&rsquo;s success. Supply manage-
ment must manage the suppliers of these critical items more intently than
those providing lower-value, standardized, or easy-to-obtain items or
commodities.

<p>Supplier Quality Matters
on the Ground&mdash;and in
the Air!
</p>
<p>In 2004, a British Airways Boeing B-777 aircraft taking off from Houston&rsquo;s George
Bush Intercontinental Airport experienced an in-flight emergency when an engine manu-
factured by General Electric caught fire. According to GE and National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) documents, the cause of the malfunction was traced to a fatigue crack in a
high-pressure turbine blade. The failed blade caused a severe vibration in the engine, which
ultimately damaged an oil seal, allowing engine oil to enter air lines. Subsequently, the
plane&rsquo;s cockpit and passenger cabin were filled with smoke and fumes. The flight crew then
declared an emergency and made an immediate landing back at Bush Intercontinental.
</p>
<p>The raw material casting for the turbine blade had been misidentified with an incorrect part
number. Because of this mistake, the turbine blade remained in service far beyond its speci-
fied limits, allowing the fatigue crack to occur. In addition, in-plant inspections designed to
prevent such an error were judged inadequate. GE&rsquo;s internal investigation showed that its em-
ployees had failed to identify the error when they processed the part and cleared it for installa-
tion. The error ultimately cost GE $8 million and subjected it to an NTSB investigation.

<p>&bull; The resources available to support supplier quality management and im-
provement. Firms with limited resources and minimal expertise in quality
management and supplier improvement must carefully select where to bud-
get their resources. Resource availability will greatly influence the overall
scope of the firm&rsquo;s quality management efforts. These resources typically in-
clude personnel, budget, time, and information technology.
</p>
<p>&bull; The ability of a buying firm to practice world-class quality. A buying firm
can help its suppliers understand the use and application of quality con-
cepts, tools, and techniques only after the buying firm itself understands and
correctly applies these concepts and tools internally.
</p>
<p>&bull; A supplier&rsquo;s willingness to work jointly to improve quality. Not all suppliers
are willing to work closely and collaboratively with a buying firm. Instead,
some suppliers may prefer a traditional purchase arrangement characterized
by limited buyer involvement and a more hand&rsquo;s-off or laissez-faire manage-
ment style. Others will enthusiastically embrace a long-term, collaborative
partnership.

<p>&bull; A supplier&rsquo;s current quality levels. A supplier&rsquo;s current performance level

<p>Intel Knows the Impor-
tance of Supplier Quality
</p>
<p>When Intel thinks about supplier quality, it knows that any slips go right to the com-
pany&rsquo;s bottom line. &ldquo;If you take a look at what Intel&rsquo;s revenues are, any kind of problem
from a supplier, such as a delivery or quality issue, has an enormous potentially negative rev-
enue impact on Intel. It&rsquo;s much more than any other semiconductor company in the world,&rdquo;
says Intel&rsquo;s materials quality systems manager. Intel relies extensively on suppliers for pro-
cess equipment to run its chip-making facilities. &ldquo;If we have a problem with a supplier,&rdquo;
the quality manager says, &ldquo;it could mean a billion dollars to us. There aren&rsquo;t too many other
semiconductor manufacturers that face a billion-dollar jeopardy if there is a supplier
problem.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The need for total supplier quality is one reason Intel developed its Supplier Continuous Qual-
ity Improvement (SCQI) program. To win Intel&rsquo;s SCQI award, suppliers must adhere to rigor-
ous quality standards set forth by three high-level requirements. These are a supplier report
card score, a Standard Supplier Quality Assessment, and a SCQI plan that measures how
well the supplier meets its improvement goals. A vice president at an Intel supplier main-
tains, &ldquo;In terms of customer requirements, Intel&rsquo;s quality systems and other special require-
ments are more stringent and are a higher level of requirements than the typical customer
we have.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Intel&rsquo;s SCQI program focuses on the weak-link-in-the-supply-chain theory. This theory states
that a supply chain is only as good as its weakest performer. &ldquo;If we can make our supply
base a stronger link, that will make Intel a stronger link in its supply chain to its own cus-
tomers. We look at a program like SCQI and try to drive improved performance among our sup-
pliers,&rdquo; explains Intel&rsquo;s materials quality systems manager.

ment must utilize an effective monitoring system and collect the proper

<p>Supplier Quality Management Using a Total Quality
Management Perspective
</p>
<p>Supply management professionals at all organizational levels must fully under-
stand and commit themselves to the principles of total quality management if they ex-
pect to create upstream value in the supply chain that benefits downstream
customers. Applying these principles to supplier quality management becomes criti-
cal if firms want to avoid embarrassing and costly errors like those shown in the open-
ing chapter vignette.
</p>
<p>The principles that comprise TQM make up perhaps the most robust and power-
ful business philosophy ever developed. Unfortunately, merely reciting these princi-
ples is far easier than embracing and practicing them on a day-to-day basis.
Although external suppliers provide more than half the inputs required within a typi-
cal supply chain, a bona fide commitment to TQM is often lacking. If supplier qual-
ity is so important, why do many supply management departments lack the
necessary measurement systems that provide timely and objective information about
supplier performance? Why do many buyers make critical supplier selection deci-
sions without analyzing and understanding a supplier&rsquo;s production processes?

<p>activities that, if fully put into place, will help ensure that firms truly practice TQM
in their pursuit of superior supplier quality.
</p>
<p>Defining Quality in Terms of Customers
and Their Requirements
</p>
<p>In a buyer-seller relationship, the buyer is the supplier&rsquo;s direct customer in the sup-
ply chain. One of the primary causes of nonconforming supplier quality involves in-
consistent communication and the resulting misunderstanding of specifications,
expectations, and requirements between supply chain members. Supply managers,
working closely with engineers and other internal customers, must provide clear speci-
fications and unambiguous performance requirements regarding the design and opera-
tion of a product, as well as any other relevant information that will ultimately affect
the quality or delivery of a purchased input. Another important form of buyer com-
munication is sharing of final product requirements, which at times may be broad or
incomplete. In this case, the process for determining final requirements must be estab-
lished and mutually agreed upon between buyer and supplier.
</p>
<p>Keki Bhote, a leading quality expert, argues that the incomplete or inaccurate devel-
opment and communication of specifications has a disproportionate effect on sup-
plier quality.
</p>
<p>At least half or even more of the quality problems between customer [i.e.,
the buyer] and supplier are caused by poor specifications, for which the cus-
tomer company is largely responsible. Most specifications are vague or arbi-
trary. They are generally determined unilaterally by engineering, which
lifts them from some boiler-plate document and embellishes them with fac-
tors of safety to protect its hide. When bids go out to suppliers, the latter
are seldom consulted on specifications, and most suppliers are afraid to
challenge specifications for fear of losing the bid . . . . So the first cure
for poor supplier quality is to eliminate the tyranny of capricious
specifications.5
</p>
<p>Developing a clear understanding of a buyer&rsquo;s expectations and requirements has
two dimensions. The first is the ability of the buying company to succinctly identify,
clearly define, quantify, or specify its technical and sourcing requirements. The sec-
ond dimension is the buyer&rsquo;s ability to effectively communicate these requirements,
which means that both parties completely understand the requirements. Buyers (i.e.,
customers) must take the initiative and clearly communicate their requirements
through detailed requests for proposals, the contract negotiation process, and regular
performance feedback sessions, using measurement systems that quantify perfor-
mance expectations and requirements.
</p>
<p>The ability of a supplier to fulfill requirements is partly a function of the buyer&rsquo;s ex-
plicitly informing the supplier about what the buyer expects. Exhibit 8.2 on p. 280
provides an example of effectively communicating a purchaser&rsquo;s requirements or ex-
pectations to a supplier.
</p>
<p>Deming&rsquo;s 14 Points
Dr. W. Edwards Deming, widely considered to be the father of the modern quality
</p>
<p>movement, developed a comprehensive 14-point management philosophy as the ba-
sis for his views on achieving performance excellence in the modern organization,

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>which is applicable to manufacturing and service industries alike, as well as govern-
ment and education. However, Deming&rsquo;s quality philosophy has often been criticized
because it does not prescribe specific actions and programs for management to fol-
low. One of the unique features of the Deming philosophy, as outlined in Exhibit 8.3,
is that these 14 points are not an a la carte menu of quality improvement activities,
from which a company can pick and choose only those with which they agree.

<p>Exhibit 8.3 Unique Features of Deming&rsquo;s Philosophy
</p>
<p>&bull; Variation is the primary source of quality nonconformance.
&bull; To reduce variation, the search for improved quality is a never-ending cycle of design, produc-
</p>
<p>tion, and delivery, followed by surveying customers&mdash;then starting all over again.
&bull; Although quality is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility, senior management has the ultimate responsibility
</p>
<p>for quality improvement.
&bull; Interacting parts of a system must be managed together as a whole, not separately.
&bull; Psychology helps managers understand their employees and customers, as well as interactions
</p>
<p>between people.
&bull; Intrinsic motivation is more powerful than extrinsic motivation.
&bull; Predictions must be grounded in theory that helps to understand cause-and-effect relationships.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>His philosophy dictates that all 14 are complementary and necessary to successfully
implement a TQM culture.6
</p>
<p>Point 1: Create a Vision and Demonstrate Commitment
The top managers and executives in an organization are responsible for delineat-
</p>
<p>ing its future strategic direction: mission, vision, and values. Not only do businesses
exist to make a profit for their shareholders and owners, but they must also consider
and be good stewards of the overall social and physical environment in which they op-
erate. This requires a long-term view and commitment of sufficient resources by the
organization: time, money, and effort.
</p>
<p>Point 2: Learn the New Philosophy
Quality must be learned (and relearned continually) by everyone in the organiza-
</p>
<p>tion, which then serves as the pervasive thread that is woven throughout everything
the organization does. The focal point of the Deming philosophy is that the entire or-
ganization should be focused on satisfying customer needs, whether the customer is
internal or external. Quality is no longer just for manufacturing.
</p>
<p>Point 3: Understand Inspection
Inspecting for defects has been the traditional method of controlling quality since
</p>
<p>the Industrial Revolution. The underlying consideration has been that an organiza-
tion recognizes that defects are inevitable and therefore must be inspected out of the
process. Deming indicates that the proper way to deal with defects is to design and op-
erate the process such that defects never occur. This point requires that everyone,
from the production line worker all the way through the executive suite, understands
the concept of process variation and how it affects every production process. Rework
and disposal efforts (also known as the &ldquo;hidden factory&rdquo;) increase cost and decrease
productivity.
</p>
<p>Point 4: Stop Making Decisions Purely on the Basis of Price
The lowest purchase price of an item may be good in the short run for the supply
</p>
<p>management department but may cause increased costs somewhere else in the produc-
tion system over the long run: scrap, defects, warranty claims, and so on. Modern sup-
ply management has embraced this point through its supply base optimization and
rationalization initiatives. The focus should be on reducing total system costs, not
just purchase price. Working with fewer suppliers allows the supply manager to con-
centrate on building trusting, collaborative relationships and supplier loyalty while im-
proving quality in purchased goods and services. Communication between buyer and
supplier is also enhanced.
</p>
<p>Point 5: Improve Constantly and Forever
The quality-oriented organization must intimately understand its customers&rsquo; needs
</p>
<p>and wants as they evolve. If the firm remains static in its quality performance, its com-
petition will eventually improve and bypass it. Continuous improvement, or kaizen,
must be built into every single process in the organization. There is always room for
improvement whether the organization is a market leader or not. In addition to main-
taining continuous communication with its customers, the TQM organization must S

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>also look at reducing process variation and seeking innovation in both product and
process.
</p>
<p>Point 6: Institute Training
It is very important that management provide its employees and suppliers with
</p>
<p>the necessary knowledge, skills, and tools to do their jobs efficiently and effectively.
Well-developed and specifically targeted training and development can enhance qual-
ity and worker productivity, as well as improve morale. Quality-wise, training should
address diagnostic and analytic tools, decision making, and problem-solving skills.
</p>
<p>Point 7: Institute Leadership
There is a significant gap between leadership and what we traditionally think of as
</p>
<p>management or supervision. Managers and supervisors are more involved in the day-
to-day oversight and direction of workers. Leadership goes well beyond management
and supervision by guiding and coaching employees to improve their skills and abili-
ties with an eye to becoming more productive and delivering higher quality.
</p>
<p>Point 8: Drive Out Fear
In the workplace, fear is obvious in a variety of ways. Employees may be fearful of
</p>
<p>making a mistake and being reprimanded for it. Most people have a fear of failure,
so they don&rsquo;t want to try anything new or different. They are also creatures of habit
and don&rsquo;t like to make changes to their routines. Managers may be fearful of letting
go of their traditional control-based power. Departments may not want to collabo-
rate with other departments. Fear-free organizations are rare; it takes a long time to
develop a culture that promotes risk taking and change. Eliminating fear encourages
employee and supplier trial-and-error experimentation, which can lead to greater pro-
ductivity and higher-quality processes.
</p>
<p>Point 9: Optimize the Efforts of Teams
Teams are becoming more and more a part of day-to-day organizational life.
</p>
<p>When implemented and operated correctly, teams can be useful in eliminating cross-
functional barriers by taking people from different departments and having them
work together on a common task or project. Dysfunctional teams can have the oppo-
site effect; they may actually create additional barriers and reinforce existing ones.
One of the greatest barriers in Western companies that restricts the potential effective-
ness of teams is the mutual distrust between unions and management.
</p>
<p>Point 10: Eliminate Exhortations
Slogans, signs, and posters are meant to change people&rsquo;s behavior. However, they
</p>
<p>are seldom effective because they assume that most, if not all, quality problems are
due to human behavior. &ldquo;Do it right the first time&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zero defects&rdquo; are catchy moti-
vational sayings, but they don&rsquo;t help workers know what to do or how to do it better.
Most quality deficiencies are based on the innate design and operation of the systems
that create goods and services, not on worker motivation. Designed-in systemic varia-
tion is a managerial concern, not a labor issue.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Point 11: Eliminate Numerical Quotas and Measurement by Objective
Workers may circumvent the system to make their production and output goals.
</p>
<p>These goals do not provide the necessary incentives for workers or suppliers to im-
prove quality. Output standards short-circuit TQM improvements and other quality
initiatives. Why would workers stop to fix or adjust a piece of equipment if it meant
that they would not make their production quota? In addition, many numerically
based goals and objectives are often arbitrary and beyond the control of the worker.
Goals should be developed in conjunction with the skills and means to achieve them.
Lastly, goals are often short-term in their focus, whereas quality improvement, by de-
sign, must take a longer-term perspective.
</p>
<p>Point 12: Remove Barriers to Pride in Workmanship
Too often, workers are treated as a commodity&mdash;simply interchangeable with each
</p>
<p>other with no uniqueness or consideration. Managers are often treated in the same
manner when they are required to routinely work longer hours without overtime com-
pensation. The performance appraisal systems that most organizations utilize create
barriers to pride in workmanship in that they promote competitive behavior and
quantity over quality. When given the proper climate in which to work, most people
want to do a good job. Unfortunately, the evaluation and reward systems in many
companies do not stimulate the right kind of culture to allow the workers to take
pride in their efforts. For example, we assign people to work in teams but appraise
and pay them as individuals.
</p>
<p>Point 13: Encourage Education and Self-Improvement
Unlike training, which is geared primarily toward learning specific task-related
</p>
<p>skills, education and self-improvement are much broader in nature and focus on im-
proving the quality of life for individuals by teaching them new skills and building
higher levels of self-worth. Organizations that invest in education and self-improve-
ment initiatives often find that their employees are more highly motivated and bring
additional benefits to both the organization and the individual in terms of productiv-
ity and quality.
</p>
<p>Point 14: Take Action
Top management must initiate and invest in those activities that result in im-
</p>
<p>proved quality, productivity, and quality of work life. A grassroots TQM effort that
emanates from the lower levels of the organization is doomed to failure without ac-
tive and visible top management commitment and support. Appropriate support may
include time and monetary investments in process design, education, and training;
new evaluation, reward, and compensation systems; and a changed organization cul-
ture. The key for success is to maintain the momentum over the long term.
</p>
<p>Pursuing Quality at the Source
Quality at the source occurs whenever value is added to a product or service as it
</p>
<p>moves through the supply chain. The value-adding points or activities in a process
represent potential defect originations that require careful management and attention
to detail. Perhaps more than any other group, supply management has the ability to
affect quality at the source because of its ability to determine and manage the exter-
nal source for many supply chain inputs.

</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Supplier Quality Management 283</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Because suppliers themselves are a major source of supply chain quality, it makes
intuitive sense that the firm&rsquo;s supplier selection process would be a primary vehicle
through which to operationalize this principle. Although the cost of making interna-
tional supplier site visits is quite substantial, the cost of making a poor supplier selec-
tion decision can be significantly higher. Skilled and experienced cross-functional
teams (CFTs) should visit and evaluate a potential supplier to determine its financial
condition, global capacity, logistical networks, supply management practices, process
capability, willingness to work with the buyer, and technology innovation before mak-
ing a strategic sourcing selection decision. See Chapter 7 for a more in-depth discus-
sion of supplier evaluation and selection.
</p>
<p>A second major area that defines supplier quality is product and process design.
Progressive companies involve suppliers in both product and process development at
a much earlier stage than has traditionally been the case. Allowing a supplier to ap-
ply its experience and expertise in a development project, known as early supplier de-
sign involvement (ESDI), often leads to better quality and product design because the
knowledge and experience of the supplier is involved during the initial development
of the customer&rsquo;s requirements well before final specifications and cost structure are
locked in. Suppliers can provide suggestions about how to simplify a product or pro-
cess, anticipate and begin preproduction work, and collaborate with the buyer&rsquo;s de-
sign engineers to establish reasonable tolerances that more closely match the
supplier&rsquo;s capabilities and improve product quality and manufacturability.
</p>
<p>Although the logic behind ESDI is relatively straightforward, making it work effec-
tively on a day-to-day basis is often difficult. Many firms continue to struggle with
sharing proprietary information with outside entities. In addition, some firms simply
do not know how to manage this delicate and sensitive process. The mere presence
of such constraints, however, does not mean that firms should not actively pursue
early involvement with carefully selected suppliers. Both the buyer and supplier will
be better off by working together collaboratively in the design phase of new-product
development or through value analysis and value engineering initiatives.
</p>
<p>Stressing Objective Rather Than Subjective
Measurement and Analysis
</p>
<p>An executive responsible for coordinating Xerox&rsquo;s successful drive for the Mal-
colm Baldrige National Quality Award once stated that one of the keys to achieving
total quality is recognizing that facts, rather than subjective judgment, must predomi-
nate.7 Hence, if facts must drive decision making, the need for fact-based measure-
ment becomes evident.
</p>
<p>However, many organizations, large and small, have not sufficiently developed ob-
jective or rigorous supplier measurement systems, during either supplier selection or
postselection measurement and evaluation. Although there are many reasons for this,
a primary one is that executives have historically not perceived the importance of ex-
ternal suppliers. Even today, there are wide differences in the quality and capability
of supply chain performance measurement.
</p>
<p>A survey by Purchasing magazine revealed that 51% of responding firms lacked an
adequate system for measuring supplier performance. Furthermore, only 1 in 10 re-
spondents claimed to be satisfied with existing supplier measurement systems. Of
those firms that did measure supplier quality on a regular basis, almost 70% said
their supplier measurement system had noticeably improved the performance of

<p>284 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>measured suppliers.8 A Council of Logistics Management study revealed that, al-
though a majority of firms measured some aspect of supply chain performance, most
of their measurement systems focused on monitoring internal supply chain activities
or functions rather than tracking the end-to-end performance of supply chain
processes.9
</p>
<p>Why is measurement so important to supplier quality? Performance data allow
supply managers to develop a preferred supplier list for awarding future business,
identify continuous performance improvement opportunities, provide feedback that
supports corrective action or future development, and track the results from improve-
ment initiatives. Effective supplier performance measurement systems are also an ex-
cellent way to communicate a buyer&rsquo;s quality and performance expectations.
</p>
<p>Emphasizing Prevention Rather Than
Detection of Defects
</p>
<p>Prevention is the avoidance of nonconformance in products and services by not al-
lowing errors or defects to occur in the first place. Although preventive activities take
many forms, each stresses the need for consistency and reduced variation in the pro-
cess. A thorough emphasis on defect prevention reduces reliance on appraisal, inspec-
tion, and other detection activities. A rigorous and structured approach to supplier
evaluation and selection, for example, is an ideal way to ensure that selected suppli-
ers have the requisite systems, processes, and methods in place to prevent defects.
</p>
<p>A supplier certification program, another prime way to prevent defects, is the for-
mal process of verifying, usually through an intensive cross-functional site audit, that
a supplier&rsquo;s processes and methods produce consistent and conforming quality. Certi-
fication demands that suppliers demonstrate process capability, use of statistical pro-
cess control, and conformance to other accepted TQM practices. The objective of
supplier certification is to ensure that nonconforming items do not leave a supplier&rsquo;s
facility. Supplier certification usually applies only to a specific part, process, or site
rather than an entire company or product. The Good Practice Example at the end of
the chapter presents one company&rsquo;s approach to supplier certification.
</p>
<p>The extensive use of corrective action requests also supports prevention of non-
conforming defects. For example, FedEx, a Baldrige Award winner, uses a corrective
action request system to protect the physical appearance of its brand. When FedEx
or a supplier discovers a critical defect with printed shipping forms, the supplier
must immediately investigate and remove the source of the error to prevent future de-
fects. The supplier is also required to sort and inspect its current production, remove
all defective units, and examine 10 boxes of stock below and 10 boxes above the dis-
covered defect. Finally, the supplier must submit a full written explanation and correc-
tive plan to FedEx for resolving the defect (root cause analysis) along with a
continuous-improvement plan.10 Although corrective action requests do not prevent
the initial problem (they are forwarded to suppliers in response to an identified prob-
lem), their timely use helps prevent further problems. Exhibit 8.4 on p. 286 presents
a sample corrective action form.
</p>
<p>Focusing on Process Rather Than Output
Perhaps the most dramatic difference between traditional methods and total quality
</p>
<p>management thinking involves a shift from a product orientation to a process orienta-
tion. Total quality management puts the focus on the processes that create output

<p>rather than the output itself. Because quality processes create quality output, a logical fo-
cus is on the process of creation rather than the result. It is far less expensive and more
efficient in the long run to avoid the defect than it is to inspect for it once it is created.
</p>
<p>Assume that an organization evaluates and awards business primarily on the basis
of competitive bids and supplier samples. At best, suppliers will provide one or two
samples to the buyer for detailed analysis and acceptance. The following questions
highlight the risk of focusing strictly on inspected output rather than the underlying
process:
</p>
<p>&bull; What supplier would knowingly submit a poor sample?
</p>
<p>&bull; How many parts did the supplier produce to get an acceptable sample?
</p>
<p>&bull; Are the samples representative of the process operating under normal
conditions?
</p>
<p>&bull; Did the supplier use the same process, methods, and materials that it will
use during normal production, or was the sample made under controlled lab-
oratory conditions?
</p>
<p>&bull; Did the supplier actually produce the sample, or did a subcontractor?
</p>
<p>&bull; Do samples tell the buyer enough about the supplier&rsquo;s capacity or process
capability?
</p>
<p>An emphasis on process rather than finished product demands that a supplier pro-
vide evidence of its process capability (addressed in the next section) to buyers on an
ongoing, regular basis. Furthermore, every time a supplier modifies a process, a new
capability study is required. Focusing on process means minimizing over-reliance on
samples unless there is a timely and comprehensive method of validating sample
conformance.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to maintain a process focus involves developing a structured
companywide supplier evaluation and selection system, which itself represents a pro-
cess. A well-defined supplier selection process supports the development of best prac-
tices, reduces duplication across units, supports the transfer of knowledge across
teams or units, and recognizes the critical link between the selection decision and sup-
ply chain quality. Leading-edge firms make their selection process, along with any sup-
porting tools and templates, available through their company&rsquo;s intranet for easy
access and widespread availability.
</p>
<p>Basics of Process Capability
Process capability is the ability of a process to generate outputs that meet engineer-
</p>
<p>ing specifications or customer requirements. To be considered capable, the outputs
from a process must fall between upper and lower specification limits. We assume
that the distribution of output from the process is normally distributed. One prop-
erty of normally distributed data is that 99.73% of all possible observations of process
output are within three standard deviations of the process mean. A process that is
stable and in control can be expected to produce virtually of its output within these
natural tolerance limits. If the natural tolerance limits fall within the product&rsquo;s
engineering specifications, the process is deemed to be capable.
</p>
<p>Two process capability indices are used to measure a process&rsquo;s capability: Cp and
Cpk. In order to calculate these indices, the process under study must be in statistical
control with only common causes of variation being present. The Cp process capabil-
ity index quantifies the relationship between the process&rsquo;s natural tolerance limits

<p>and the product&rsquo;s specifications using a two-sided approach. It is calculated by sub-
tracting the lower specification limit from the upper specification limit and dividing
by six standard deviations. Many quality practitioners suggest a relatively safe Cp
index value of 1.5 or higher. Many customer companies require an even higher
Cp value of 1.66 for added assurance that process output will conform to product
specifications.11
</p>
<p>However, the Cp index does not account for situations where the process is not cen-
tered on the nominal specification target value. For situations where the natural pro-
cess mean is not centered, the Cpk index must be used. The Cpk index provides a
conservative adjustment to the Cp index that takes into account how far the process
mean is from the target value. Hence, the Cpk value is always smaller than the Cp
index.12
</p>
<p>A process capability study is designed to provide information about the perfor-
mance of the process under stable operating conditions, that is, when no special
causes of variation are present. The process capability study can provide information
to address the following:
</p>
<p>1. Determine the operating baseline of a process
</p>
<p>2. Prioritize potential quality improvement projects
</p>
<p>3. Provide evidence of process performance to a customer
</p>
<p>Striving for Zero Defects
Philip Crosby argued that the only performance standard that defines total quality
</p>
<p>is zero defects, which he defined as conformance to requirements. Genichi Taguchi fur-
ther argued that any deviation from a target value carries with it some level of oppor-
tunity loss due to scrap, rework, and customer dissatisfaction.13 We can operationalize
the pursuit of zero defects, however defined, in several important ways. Each method
recognizes the importance of eliminating product and process variability.
</p>
<p>As mentioned, a well-designed and rigorous supplier evaluation and selection pro-
cess is one way to identify and do business only with suppliers that strive for zero de-
fects. Measurement systems using key metrics also help identify improvement
opportunities and progress. Another major approach, and one of the fastest and
most effective ways to improve supply chain quality, is supply base rationalization.
</p>
<p>Supply base rationalization or optimization, presented in detail in Chapter 9, is the
process of determining the right mix and number of suppliers to maintain for a
given purchase category or commodity. Almost half of the companies participating in
a recent survey reduced their supply bases by 20%, and nearly 15% reduced their sup-
ply bases between 20 and 60%. Furthermore, three quarters of the firms indicated
that they now commit 80% of their total purchase dollars with fewer than 100 suppli-
ers.14 Optimization is a continuous activity.
</p>
<p>The supply base rationalization and optimization process is critical to improving
supplier quality. More advanced strategic sourcing approaches, such as early supplier
design involvement and supply chain alliances, demand a reduced supply base. Fur-
thermore, if a firm rationalizes and optimizes its supply base properly, the remaining
suppliers should be only those that are the most capable of providing consistent
goods and services. Inconsistency is the enemy of total quality. Few supply managersS

<p>knowingly eliminate their best suppliers. By definition, average supplier quality will in-
crease as lower performers are eliminated.
</p>
<p>Cost of Quality15
Quality has two impacts on the costs of a company: the costs due to nonconform-
</p>
<p>ing quality and the costs related to improving quality. Because the language of man-
agement is quantified in dollars, it is important to measure and track how funds are
spent in regard to quality. Within this broader viewpoint, the cost of quality can be
subcategorized into three classifications: appraisal, failure, and prevention.
</p>
<p>Appraisal costs include the direct costs of measuring quality, specifically checking
for defects. Areas of appraisal-related expense include laboratory testing of samples,
inspection activities during production, supplier quality audits, incoming material in-
spections, and other forms of monitoring.
</p>
<p>Failure costs are further divided into internal and external elements. Internal fail-
ure costs occur before the product or service is provided, whereas external failure
costs are incurred following production or after the customer takes possession. Ex-
amples of internal failure costs include troubleshooting, reinspection following detec-
tion of a defect, production downtime caused by defects, scrap, and process waste.
Examples of external failure costs include warranty costs, replacement of defective
products to customers, lawsuits, and loss of customers.
</p>
<p>Prevention costs are costs incurred when production processes are designed or mod-
ified to prevent defects from occurring in the first place. Examples include quality
planning, equipment calibration, quality training, and maintenance of a quality man-
agement system.
</p>
<p>Many traditional cost accounting systems are notorious for their failure to provide
clear and concise information on just where funds are spent on quality-related ex-
penses. These expenses are often incurred in various departments and not under the
control of personnel with quality responsibilities. In addition, many quality-related
costs, such as training, are somewhat subjective in nature and not easily identified.
</p>
<p>Establishing Continuous Improvement as a Way of Life
The pressure for continuous improvement is severe and relentless. Fortunately,
</p>
<p>there are a variety of ways to make supplier improvement part of the prevailing orga-
nizational culture. One approach involves using a supplier measurement system to
shift performance targets. The upward shifting of performance targets takes effect
once a supplier demonstrates that it can achieve current performance expectations
and is willing to improve. Ideally, supplier performance improves at a rate faster
than what the buyer&rsquo;s competitors are realizing from their suppliers.
</p>
<p>Value analysis/value engineering (VA/VE), presented in Chapter 12, is another ap-
proach for pursuing continuous improvement. VA/VE is the organized and system-
atic study of every element of cost in a part, material, process, or service to ensure
that it fulfills its design function at the lowest possible total cost. Suppliers that are
an active part of the VA/VE process actively review customer specifications, submit
ideas on materials and process improvements, and work with the buyer to identify
and remove nonconformance costs. This approach represents one of the better ways
of institutionalizing continuous improvement in the supply base.

<p>Perhaps one of the most substantial changes over the last several years involves an
increased willingness by larger firms to help develop supplier performance capabili-
ties, a major topic in Chapter 9. Many activities can qualify as supplier development
initiatives. Buyers, for example, are increasingly willing to offer Six Sigma quality
training to suppliers. These buyers expect their Tier 1 suppliers to support the qual-
ity efforts of Tier 2 suppliers, and so on back through the supply chain.
</p>
<p>If a firm has streamlined its supply base to a manageable level, and if remaining
suppliers receive longer-term, higher-volume contracts, then it becomes clear that
switching suppliers will be increasingly difficult and costly. Once a firm fully rational-
izes its supply base, improvement will occur primarily by developing the capabilities
of current suppliers rather than by switching suppliers on a large scale.
</p>
<p>A buyer can also offer rewards to encourage a supplier&rsquo;s continuous-improvement
efforts. In fact, most supply managers have at their disposal some very powerful in-
centives and rewards to positively influence supplier behavior. Offering performance-
related rewards to suppliers recognizes that there is a direct link between reward and
performance improvement. Traditionally, buyers demanded supplier improvement
but were reluctant to share the resulting benefit, which encouraged self-promoting be-
havior by suppliers. Exhibit 8.5 highlights the various rewards that are available to en-
courage continuous supplier improvement. Sourcing Snapshot: Do Cost Reduction
Pressures Affect Supplier Quality? provides additional discussion on this topic.
</p>
<p>Making Quality Everyone&rsquo;s Responsibility
This principle requires that buyers and suppliers assume ownership for total qual-
</p>
<p>ity across the supply chain. The issue becomes how buyers can align their vision of
and need for supplier quality improvement.
</p>
<p>Physically co-locating with suppliers is a powerful way to make quality everyone&rsquo;s re-
sponsibility and improve buyer-supplier communication. There are a number of ways
</p>
<p>Exhibit 8.5 Providing Incentives for Supplier Quality Improvement

<p>to create physical coexistence with suppliers. For example, Johnson Controls shares a
225,000-square-foot facility with its plastic mold supplier, Becker Group L.L.C.16 Plastic
door panels produced by the supplier flow directly into Johnson Control&rsquo;s assembly pro-
cess, allowing immediate quality feedback and eliminating the possibility of in-transit
damage. Likewise, Volkswagen built a truck assembly plant in Brazil with seven suppli-
ers located within the assembly facility. These suppliers produce components and sub-
assemblies in the VW facility using their own equipment, with their own labor
assembling those items into finished trucks and buses.
</p>
<p>Progressive organizations are forming executive-level buyer-supplier councils as a
means of aligning and creating a partnership with carefully selected suppliers. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 5, these councils meet on a regular basis to coordinate longer-term
product, process, and technology requirements; identify projects that buyers and sup-
pliers can work on jointly; and promote closer and more collaborative supply chain re-
lationships. Making quality each participant&rsquo;s responsibility is essential for total
supply chain quality.
</p>
<p>Sourcing
Snapshot
</p>
<p>Do Cost Reduction Pres-
sures Affect Supplier
Quality?
</p>
<p>In 2001, a survey reported that automotive suppliers were cutting corners in response
to OEM demands for price reductions. Only 20% of 261 reporting suppliers indicated that
they were improving quality. Unfortunately, tragedies, such as the widespread failure of Fire-
stone tires installed on Ford Explorers, provide substantial evidence that something is awry.
The resulting charges and countercharges between the two companies raised serious con-
cerns about the quality and safety of two of America&rsquo;s oldest brands.
</p>
<p>Cost reductions alone do not necessarily signify lower quality. According to Industry Week&rsquo;s
2000 census of manufacturers, which surveyed 3,000 companies, manufacturers that were
able to reduce their scrap and waste showed more improvement in quality than those whose
costs increased. Although taking out waste is good, trimming into the bone is not. When buy-
ers demand deep price cuts from suppliers that are already operating with razor-thin mar-
gins, it should come as no surprise that attention to quality might suffer as a result. The
rampant cost cutting over the last two decades has caused some producers to question
what level of durability and material quality they are willing to design into their products.
</p>
<p>Some companies truly understand how to effectively manage cost reductions while achieving
continuous quality improvements. Toyota, for example, expects a 3% reduction in costs each
year from its suppliers. Even with these year-after-year price reductions from suppliers, how
does Toyota maintain its reputation for product quality? The company&rsquo;s willingness to work
collaboratively with suppliers to identify ways to jointly reduce costs is in stark contrast to
simply mandating reductions, reductions that could lead to decreases in product quality and
safety.

<p>Pursuing Six Sigma Supplier Quality
The total quality principles just discussed work only if firms are able to oper-
</p>
<p>ationalize them and demonstrate tangible results. When total quality first was popular-
ized in the 1980s, too many firms educated their employees in the principles of TQM
without committing the resources or time necessary to change a culture that believed
&ldquo;close enough is good enough.&rdquo; It is not surprising that many firms failed to achieve
the kinds of performance improvement that they envisioned from total quality ef-
forts. As a result, many participants became cynical about all total quality efforts, call-
ing total quality &ldquo;the management program of the month.&rdquo; &ldquo;If we just wait another
month,&rdquo; many said, &ldquo;management will move on to another fad.&rdquo; In addition, few buy-
ing organizations extended their internal total quality efforts out to their suppliers.
</p>
<p>The fact that many firms became disillusioned with their total quality programs
does not eliminate the competitive need to seek total quality improvement. Six Sigma
is today&rsquo;s version of total quality management. Thomas Pyzdek, a noted Six Sigma au-
thor and consultant, explained the importance of Six Sigma this way:
</p>
<p>Six Sigma is a rigorous, focused and highly effective implementation of
proven quality principles and techniques. Incorporating elements from the
work of many quality pioneers, Six Sigma aims for virtually error-free busi-
ness performance. Sigma, σ, is a letter in the Greek alphabet used by statisti-
cians to measure the variability in any process. A company&rsquo;s performance
is measured by the sigma level of their business processes. Traditionally com-
panies accepted three or four sigma performance levels as the norm, despite
the fact that these processes created between 6,200 and 67,000 problems per
million opportunities! The Six Sigma standard of 3.4 problems per million
opportunities is a response to the increasing expectations of customers and
the increased complexity of modern products and processes.
</p>
<p>Six Sigma focuses on improving quality (i.e., reduce waste) by helping or-
ganizations produce products and services better, faster and cheaper. In
more traditional terms, Six Sigma focuses on defect prevention, cycle time
reduction, and cost savings. Unlike mindless cost-cutting programs which re-
duce value and quality, Six Sigma identifies and eliminates costs which pro-
vide no value to customers&rsquo; waste costs.17
</p>
<p>Six Sigma reduces much of the complexity that characterized early TQM efforts.
One expert estimated that TQM includes more than 400 different tools and tech-
niques. Six Sigma relies on a smaller set of proven methods and trains individuals
known as Six Sigma Black Belts to apply these sometimes sophisticated quality man-
agement tools and approaches.18 Design of experiments is an example of a quality im-
provement approach applied by Black Belts to find and eliminate defects before the
final design is specified.
</p>
<p>Many observers credit Motorola with coining the term &ldquo;Six Sigma&rdquo; and relating it
to 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMOs). Technically, Six Sigma quality
means that output will conform to desired specifications 99.9999998% of the time, or
2 defects per billion opportunities. Why, then, are references to Six Sigma phrased in
terms of 3.4 DPMO? Did someone mix up the statistical tables?
</p>
<p>The area under the normal curve beyond 6 sigmas relates to 2 parts per billion de-
fects. Six Sigma presumes, over the long term, that processes will naturally drift by as
much as 1.5 standard deviations. Hence, the defect rate that equates with 6 sigmas

<p>(meaning the output conforms 99.9999998% of the time) and 1.5 sigmas of process
drift is 3.4 DPMO. As a process shifts to the left or right due to natural variation, the
likelihood increases that output will exceed a design specification limit. Because all
processes are subject to natural variation and shifting, which can move a process
slightly toward its upper or lower design specification limits, the 2 parts per billion
rate effectively becomes 3.4 parts per million.
</p>
<p>Six Sigma quality relates to supply management in several ways. First, suppliers
that operate at 3 and 4 sigma quality levels typically spend between 25 and 40% of
their revenues fixing problems. In an era of relentless cost-reduction pressures, this
level of quality does not support longer-term competitive success. Suppliers that oper-
ate at 6 sigma levels, on the other hand, typically spend less than 5% of their reven-
ues fixing problems.19 Second, quality management is not only about managing
internal quality. Market success demands that firms identify waste upstream through
their Tier 1, Tier 2, and even Tier 3 suppliers. Many supplier development programs
use experts from the buying company to help smaller suppliers achieve Six Sigma
quality, as well as other productivity and cost improvements.
</p>
<p>One aspect of helping suppliers improve involves educating them on the Six
Sigma performance improvement model. Suppliers that apply this model should
accelerate their rate of quality improvement as compared to those that do not.
They should also make quality improvement a systematic part of their operations.

<p>Using ISO Standards and MBNQA Criteria to Assess
Supplier Quality Systems
</p>
<p>Within the United States, relatively few companies have applied a uniform set of
quality standards to their supplier certification process, resulting in duplication of
effort and other operating inefficiencies. When measuring and assessing their sup-
pliers&rsquo; quality management systems, supply managers are increasingly turning to es-
tablished quality auditing and measurement systems to drive supplier performance
improvement.
</p>
<p>Three widely accepted quality management frameworks are ISO 9000:2000, ISO
14000, and the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. Companies that are un-
able to commit the necessary resources to assess or certify supplier quality on their
own will often accept ISO 9001 registration as proxy evidence of a supplier&rsquo;s quality
capability. Other companies have used ISO 9000, ISO 14000, and MBNQA criteria to
develop their own assessment or certification processes. For these reasons, it is impor-
tant to have a basic understanding of all three programs.
</p>
<p>ISO 9000:2000 Registration
A quality management process gaining widespread acceptance throughout the
</p>
<p>world is ISO 9000:2000. Developed in 1987 to standardize quality requirements in
the European Common Market, ISO 9000 originally consisted of a series of process
quality standards&mdash;not product standards&mdash;recognizing that product quality is a di-
rect result of a quality process. Meeting these standards, not an easy task, is often por-
trayed as a minimum requirement for competing globally.
</p>
<p>In December 2000, the International Organization for Standardization released its
most recent version of ISO 9000 standards. The revised ISO 9000 document, now
called ISO 9000:2000, minimally resembles the previous standards, which were last up-
dated in 1994. Although companies use ISO 9000:2000 standards for guidance and
clarification of vocabulary terms, the actual registration that a company earns is ISO
9001:2000. The language in the new standard is less complex; the text follows an out-
line format rather than paragraphs; and ISO 9002 and ISO 9003 registrations no lon-
ger exist. ISO 9004:2000 remains a document that offers guidelines for performance
improvements above the basic requirements of ISO 9001:2000.20 To remain current,
registration must be accomplished every three years.
</p>
<p>Eight quality management principles influenced the revised ISO 9000 standards,
which are described in Sourcing Snapshot: ISO 9000 Undergoes Radical Change. ISO
9000:2000 follows a process-based approach to quality management that stresses plan-
ning, acting, analyzing results, and making improvements. The previous version
more closely resembled a random list of procedures.
</p>
<p>It is in the best interests of suppliers to pursue ISO 9000:2000 quality registration,
particularly if their customers (i.e., buyers) value the process. In addition, suppliers re-
ceive many benefits from pursuing third-party ISO registration. For example, buyers

<p>have immediate confirmation that a supplier has achieved registration according to in-
ternationally accepted quality process standards. Furthermore, buyers may be willing
to recognize ISO 9000:2000 registration in place of individual certification programs,
resulting in lower costs for the buyer and supplier.
</p>
<p>Each supplier that earns ISO 9000:2000 registration is included on a master list of
companies satisfying the ISO standard. Inclusion on this list may lead to interest
from other potential customers wanting to do business with ISO-registered compa-
nies. Suppliers that earn ISO registration will also be in a better position to satisfy cor-
responding U.S. ANSI standards as well.
</p>
<p>Buying firms also benefit from suppliers achieving ISO 9000:2000 registration.
First, few buying firms have the size or resources to independently develop and con-
duct comprehensive supplier certification audits. Registration may provide insight
into a supplier&rsquo;s quality system conformance that a buyer may otherwise lack. The
buying firm receives the benefit of a supplier quality certification without actually hav-
ing to conduct its own quality certification audits.
</p>
<p>Another potential benefit for buyers is that the supplier assumes responsibility for
meeting the ISO standards and paying its own registration fees. With individual

<p>Jack West, lead U.S. delegate to the ISO committee that revised the ISO 9000 family of
standards, stated that &ldquo;people should have quality systems that reflect the way they really op-
erate, rather than some arbitrary structure of 20 sections in a manual.&rdquo; In 2000, sentiments
like this resulted in an ISO Technical Committee revising the ISO 9000 standards that were
previously revised in 1994. The new ISO quality standards, now referred to as ISO
9000:2000, ISO 9001:2000, and ISO 9004:2000, reflect eight underlying principles.
</p>
<p>Principle 1: Customer Focus. Organizations should understand current and future
needs and strive to exceed customer expectations.
</p>
<p>Principle 2: Leadership. Leaders establish purpose and direction. They should create
an internal environment where people can help achieve the organization&rsquo;s
objectives.
</p>
<p>Principle 3: Involvement of People. Full involvement of employees at all levels will
benefit an organization.
</p>
<p>Principle 4: Process Approach. Attention to processes rather than simply output will
help achieve desired results.
</p>
<p>Principle 5: System Approach to Management. Identifying, understanding, and man-
aging interrelated processes as a system contributes to effectiveness and efficiency.
</p>
<p>Principle 6: Continual Improvement. Continual performance improvement should be-
come a permanent organizational objective.
</p>
<p>Principle 7: Factual Approach to Decision Making. Objective rather than subjective
analysis and decisions should lead to effective decision making.
</p>
<p>Principle 8: Mutually Beneficial Supplier Relationships. An organization and its sup-
pliers are interdependent. This interdependency enhances the ability to create value.

<p>supplier certification programs, the buying firm assumes most, if not all, of the ex-
penses related to certification. ISO registration requires suppliers to contract with a
recognized independent registrar that is certified to perform ISO 9000:2000 audits.
</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, suppliers that earn ISO 9001:2000 registration demon-
strate higher quality than those suppliers that do not. The buyer may have higher con-
fidence in the supplier&rsquo;s ability to meet or exceed quality requirements.
</p>
<p>ISO 14000 Standards
The ISO 14000 standards, established in 1993, are designed to promote environ-
</p>
<p>mental protection and pollution prevention. They are an excellent way to analyze
and document an organization&rsquo;s ability to proactively manage its environmental im-
pact. The standards cover a broad perspective of environmental disciplines, ranging
from the organization&rsquo;s environmental management system (EMS) to addressing au-
diting, labeling, and product standards. Benefits achieved through ISO 14000 certifica-
tion include fewer pollutants generated, reduced liability, improved regulatory
compliance, better public and community relations, and lowered insurance pre-
miums.21
</p>
<p>Another primary result of pursuing ISO 14000 certification is enhanced profitabil-
ity through improved resource management and reduced waste generation. ISO
14000 is a set of voluntary standards and consists of two general classifications:
process-oriented and product-oriented standards. It does not build upon existing gov-
ernmental regulations, establish emissions and pollution levels, or detail any specific
testing methods.22
</p>
<p>Many buying firms now require their suppliers to become ISO 14000 certified.
These suppliers must publish an organizational environmental policy, develop a com-
prehensive EMS, implement an internal auditing system, and use corrective action
plans to address unfavorable audit results.

<p>The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award
In 1987, President Ronald Reagan signed the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality
</p>
<p>Improvement Act, which established a national award to recognize quality improve-
ment among manufacturing, service, and small businesses in the United States. A
group of recognized quality professionals, including Dr. Joseph M. Juran, developed
the initial award criteria. Since then, the criteria have become a de facto definition of
TQM, and the wide dissemination of the application guidelines has exposed many
managers to the Baldrige definition of TQM. For example, many companies use the
MBNQA criteria as a template for a comprehensive quality management system, and
one of the more important outputs of the award has been the creation and dissemina-
tion of useful TQM practices.

<p>Some managers believe the MBNQA provides a more comprehensive set of quality-
related criteria for North American&ndash;based firms than does ISO 9000:2000. The
MBNQA is a competition and implies that an organization excels not only in quality
management but also in quality achievement. The application for the MBNQA pro-
vides a broad framework for implementing a quality program and establishes bench-
marks suitable for monitoring quality progress. Although the federal government has
distributed thousands of MBNQA award applications over the years, the number of
companies actively pursuing the award has actually decreased. Much of the current

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>application of the MBNQA is for internal use as a quality management tool and not
for award purposes.
</p>
<p>It can take a company 8 to 10 years to develop a quality system that is competi-
tive for the award.23 The MBNQA is composed of seven weighted categories, to-
gether worth a total of 1,000 points: leadership, strategic planning, customer and
market focus, information and analysis, human resource focus, process management,
and business results. These categories are outlined in Exhibit 8.7 on p. 297. Higher-
performing companies, with scores of 700 or more, demonstrate balanced and out-
standing performance across each of these categories.
</p>
<p>Continuous improvement is the most basic and important tenet of the MBNQA
criteria. In each of the major categories, companies must demonstrate how they plan
to improve in that area. The MBNQA criteria are both process and results oriented,
addressing operations, processes, strategies, and requirements.
</p>
<p>Just what does the MBNQA have to do with supplier quality? Many leading compa-
nies are now using MBNQA criteria when designing internal assessment systems for
supplier quality performance. Companies such as Cummins Engine, Motorola, Pacific
Bell, Alcatel, and Honeywell all use modified versions of MBNQA criteria to conduct
in-depth studies of their major suppliers&rsquo; quality management systems. They use a
similar scoring system, and trained assessors typically spend several days visiting the
supplier&rsquo;s facilities to rate their continuous-improvement efforts. Progressive compa-
nies fully understand the logic behind applying well-established quality principles
and guidelines to their total supply chain quality efforts.
</p>
<p>Good Practice
Example
</p>
<p>Supplier Certification
at Alcoa
</p>
<p>Alcoa, a world leader in the production of aluminum and related products, has devel-
oped a comprehensive audit system to certify that its suppliers satisfy the company&rsquo;s quality
expectations. A primary objective of the audit, besides resulting in a decision about supplier
quality certification, is to encourage and assist Alcoa suppliers to achieve continuous quality
improvement. One way this happens is by identifying specific supplier deficiencies that pro-
vide opportunities for improvement.
</p>
<p>Alcoa&rsquo;s certification process, like most certification systems, evaluates supplier quality sys-
tems and locations rather than individual products. Furthermore, the company involves its
suppliers directly in the quality improvement process. The process also helps these suppliers
make substantial and meaningful quality improvements (with Alcoa providing support as re-
quired), measures supplier quality improvement progress, and formally recognizes supplier
quality achievement.
</p>
<p>Alcoa&rsquo;s supplier certification process has several important features. First, the process ap-
plies to both internal and external suppliers. An internal supplier is defined as an Alcoa facil-
ity that supplies another Alcoa facility. Including internal suppliers credibly demonstrates
that Alcoa practices and follows its own quality prescriptions. Second, a trial audit of the sup-
plier&rsquo;s facility occurs before the official quality audit. This trial audit minimizes the possibil-
ity of surprise and gives the supplier a fair opportunity to prepare and improve (where
necessary) before the official audit. Third, Alcoa relies on a skilled cross-functional team to
perform these supplier audits. These CFTs provide a level of expertise that a single individ-

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ual cannot provide. Finally, suppliers receive a quantified numerical rating after the official
audit. This provides immediate visibility about how the team rates a supplier&rsquo;s quality sys-
tems and helps to compare data between audits.
</p>
<p>Alcoa divides its quality improvement process into a series of steps. Each step represents a
progression toward Alcoa&rsquo;s final objective&mdash;a supply base capable of world-class quality and
continuous improvement. Exhibit 8.8 on p. 301 presents an overview of Alcoa&rsquo;s supplier qual-
ity improvement process.
</p>
<p>STEP 1: MEET AND PLAN
Once Alcoa identifies the suppliers that it plans to evaluate and consider for certification,
the company conducts one-day overview meetings with the suppliers&rsquo; management team. A
representative from Alcoa then meets with each targeted supplier to plan a schedule of ini-
tial contact.
</p>
<p>STEP 2: THE SUPPLIER SELF-SURVEY
Each supplier has an opportunity to perform a self-survey. The self-survey covers the same
four sections as the formal audit (Step 5): quality management, quality measurement, safety
and training, and facilities. The supplier rates itself on each survey item on a scale of 0 to
10. During the self-survey, suppliers become aware of Alcoa&rsquo;s specific quality requirements.
</p>
<p>STEP 3: STRATEGY PLANNING
Alcoa and the supplier then use the results of the supplier&rsquo;s self-survey to identify specific
strengths and weaknesses. Where necessary, Alcoa assigns an employee to work directly with
the supplier to assist in developing an improvement strategy. This individual lends personal
support and guidance where required.
</p>
<p>The supplier must commit to improving itself and not relying on Alcoa personnel over the
long run to achieve necessary changes. The supplier initiates the necessary improvements to
correct deficiencies during this phase of the process.
</p>
<p>STEP 4: THE TRIAL AUDIT
The support person assigned by Alcoa conducts the trial audit once it appears that the sup-
plier has improved in each previously identified deficiency area. The trial audit serves two pur-
poses. First, it reveals the status of the supplier&rsquo;s improvement efforts. Second, it prepares
the supplier for the formal audit that will be conducted later by a cross-functional audit
team.
</p>
<p>STEP 5: THE FORMAL AUDIT
The formal review process includes information from two separate sources. First, each Alcoa
location that has direct contact with a supplier evaluates the supplier&rsquo;s performance on a
10-point scale. Internal users evaluate the supplier for material quality, delivery, paperwork,
nonconformance resolution (i.e., how the supplier resolves problems), and sales and market-
ing service.
</p>
<p>The user evaluation applies only to a specific supplier location. An Alcoa location that re-
ceives material from multiple supplier locations must evaluate each of the suppliers&rsquo; loca-
tions individually. The most comprehensive part of the certification process is the formal
supplier audit. If the results of the trial audit indicate that a supplier is likely to achieve the
minimum required for certification, then Alcoa schedules a formal audit. The company tries
to conduct the formal audit within 90 days of the trial audit.

</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Supplier Quality Management 299</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>To make the audit as objective as possible, the audit team uses a corporate supplier quality
survey. This survey includes items that relate to quality management, quality measurement,
safety and training, and facilities. The audit document defines, as precisely and concisely as
possible, the meaning of each value so the audit team can accurately and fairly evaluate a
supplier. The scoring system for each item includes a minimum score that a supplier must
achieve to qualify for certification.
</p>
<p>The team records its score for each audit statement, adds all the item scores together, notes
whether the supplier meets all minimum scoring requirements, and makes a certification rec-
ommendation. The audit team makes one of three possible recommendations: certification,
certification after corrective action, or no certification. Furthermore, a supplier that does not re-
ceive certification must have a full reaudit before any future certification is attempted.
</p>
<p>STEP 6: RECOMMENDATION REVIEW
An audit review committee evaluates the certification recommendation of the audit team be-
fore reaching a final decision. The committee also reviews the user evaluations completed dur-
ing the review process. The review committee weighs the formal audit team&rsquo;s score as 80%
of the total rating and the user evaluation as the remaining 20%.
</p>
<p>Supplier certification occurs at three levels. The initial level is a Certified Supplier, the mid-
dle level is a Preferred Supplier, and the top level is a Supplier of Excellence. Each level re-
ceives different forms of Alcoa recognition and rewards.
</p>
<p>Alcoa maintains the information from all audits and user evaluations in a database, which al-
lows the company to assess supplier progress, particularly in areas of initial deficiency. The
formal audit and certification are not the end of the quality process. Rather, these activities
represent only part of the effort to strengthen the relationship between Alcoa and its suppli-
ers. As Alcoa works with its suppliers to improve quality, a mutual trust and respect can de-
velop that further enhance improvement efforts.
</p>
<p>Alcoa&rsquo;s highly effective supplier quality certification and improvement process illustrates the
effort put forth as part of its quest for total quality. Although supplier certification requires a
major resource commitment on the part of both parties, the longer-term benefits that can re-
sult from consistently high supplier quality are worth the effort&mdash;both to Alcoa and to the
supplier.

<p>CONCLUSION
The battleground for global competitive advantage has entered the domain of sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain management. Although other competitive factors, such as mass customiza-
tion and flexibility, will increasingly become order-winning market characteristics,
the ability to design, produce, and sell high-quality products and services will always
remain a primary market qualifier. Without TQM, however, a producer should not ex-
pect serious consideration from potential customers.
</p>
<p>Improving supplier quality involves much more than providing clear specifications
and maintaining open communication. Supply management, pursuing the principles
of TQM, can effectively improve supplier quality practices and set a standard for ex-
cellence. Supplier quality excellence can be achieved by being a good customer to sup-
pliers, routinely measuring supplier performance and eliminating poor performers,
providing timely and accurate feedback, certifying and rewarding Six Sigma supplier
performance, and helping suppliers reach joint continuous-improvement goals. To
achieve total quality, supply management must have people who understand the prin-
ciples and tools of TQM, including Six Sigma, and can work effectively with suppli-
ers to ensure that zero defects is the norm rather than the exception.

<p>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. Why should a buyer be concerned with supplier quality performance?
</p>
<p>2. Discuss the following statement: Supply management not only buys parts or ser-
vices from suppliers&mdash;it buys a supplier&rsquo;s performance capability.
</p>
<p>3. Do suppliers have an equal impact on product quality? Discuss the conditions un-
der which one supplier may have a greater impact on a firm&rsquo;s final product qual-
ity as compared with another supplier.
</p>
<p>4. Why is it important for a buyer to be a good customer? How can a buyer be a
good customer to a supplier?
</p>
<p>5. How can early supplier design involvement contribute to higher levels of product
quality?
</p>
<p>6. Discuss the benefits to a supplier of achieving ISO 9000:2000 registration.
</p>
<p>7. Some supply management experts argue that suppliers should not receive rewards
for doing something that is already expected (e.g., continuously improving qual-
ity). Do you agree with this position? What are some examples of rewards that a
supplier can receive?
</p>
<p>8. Discuss the benefits to a buying company of certifying its suppliers. Describe the
benefits to a supplier of being certified.
</p>

<p>Managing Suppliers Is a Priority at Honda
of America Manufacturing
</p>
<p>Honda of America Manufacturing (HAM), with several production and assembly loca-
tions in Ohio, strongly commits to longer-term relationships and supplier development with
its suppliers. Long-term supplier viability is critical to Honda&rsquo;s profitability. First, the com-
pany fully commits to its suppliers for life. When Honda signs a sourcing contract with a sup-
plier, it expects to maintain that relationship for 25 to 50 years. Second, the company buys
80% of the cost of every car from outside suppliers&mdash;the most of any automotive producer.
Honda, therefore, commits a significant amount of its resources toward managing and devel-
oping local suppliers to ensure Honda has access to capable suppliers that can continuously
meet the company&rsquo;s stringent performance standards.
</p>
<p>Supplier development and improvement has one primary objective at Honda&mdash;to create and
maintain a dedicated supply base that supports Honda&rsquo;s U.S. requirements. Pursuit of this ob-
jective requires a substantial commitment of resources to support and develop its suppliers:
</p>
<p>&bull; Two full-time employees help suppliers develop their employee involvement
programs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Forty full-time engineers in the supply management department work with suppli-
ers to improve productivity and quality.
</p>
<p>&bull; Over 100 engineers in the quality control department deal with incoming parts
and supplier quality issues.
</p>
<p>&bull; Honda provides technical support to suppliers in a number of technical areas, in-
cluding plastics technology, welding, stamping, and aluminum die casting.
</p>
<p>&bull; Honda forms special teams to help suppliers on an ad hoc basis. One supplier,
for example, experienced problems resulting from rapid growth. Honda formed a
four-person team that moved to the supplier&rsquo;s town for nine months to help cor-
rect the problems.
</p>
<p>&bull; A &ldquo;Quality-Up&rdquo; program targets suppliers with lower quality. Honda works directly
with the supplier&rsquo;s top management team to ensure that the supplier produces a
100% quality product.
</p>
<p>&bull; Honda has a loaned-executive program where it sends various executives to work
at the supplier&rsquo;s location. This supports greater understanding and communica-
tion between Honda and its suppliers, as well as creating long-term commitment
and loyalty.
</p>
<p>However, most companies are not willing to provide this level of attention and dedication to
supplier management and development. A company that maintains either a laissez-faire or a
reactive approach to supply base management is probably not willing to provide the neces-
sary resources to support ongoing supplier development. Furthermore, some suppliers are not
willing to expose themselves to the level of scrutiny required by Honda. Honda, for example,
conducts minimal price negotiation. Instead, the company identifies a target cost and then
works with a supplier to jointly meet that cost. Such detailed cost sharing can be difficult or
traumatic for many independent suppliers.
</p>
<p>This example outlines several key points about supplier management and development. First,
suppliers play a critical role in the success of most organizations. Therefore, it makes sense
to pay attention to a supplier&rsquo;s performance improvement needs. Second, a supply base that
is too large and complex usually prohibits providing adequate supplier development support.
There simply are not enough resources available to support and develop a large supply base.
Finally, supplier development requires more than slogans and demands for better perfor-
mance. It means actually committing the joint resources to make the process successful.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As the opening vignette illustrates, progressive firms take the need to improve supplier
performance quite seriously. Gone are the days when vertically integrated companies
mass-produced products with long product life cycles. With increased global competi-
tion, companies increasingly rely on an ever-expanding network of dedicated suppli-
ers to meet their business objectives. Businesses across every industry are beginning
to realize that success requires them to organize and manage resources and processes
across a network of supply chain partners put together on purpose, not haphazardly.1
</p>
<p>Effective supplier management and development includes a broad array of actions
taken to manage and improve a worldwide network of carefully screened and se-
lected supply chain partners or suppliers. The primary objective of these future-
oriented management and development processes is the continuous improvement of
supplier capabilities. Supplier performance that is good enough today will not suffice
in the marketplace of tomorrow. History shows that, unless companies are able to
bring supply base performance to world-class levels, they will be at the mercy of com-
petitors that have taken supplier performance improvement more seriously.
</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on various ways organizations manage their supply chains. Al-
though a number of supplier management approaches exist, most fall into the broad
activities described in this chapter. The first section discusses the important relation-
ship between supplier measurement and effective supplier management. The next sec-
tion discusses supply base rationalization and optimization, the process of identifying
the proper mix and number of suppliers. The third section discusses supplier develop-
ment as a strategy for improvement. In the final section, we present some of the bar-
riers faced by organizations as they attempt to improve supplier performance
through supplier development. Finally, we conclude with a Good Practice Example of
supplier measurement at FedEx.
</p>
<p>Supplier Performance Measurement
An important part of supplier management involves the continuous measurement,
</p>
<p>evaluation, and analysis of supplier performance. An organization must have the
tools to measure, manage, and develop the performance of its supply base. Without
an effective measurement system to record and evaluate supply base performance,
how do buyers really know how well their suppliers are satisfying their contractual ob-
ligations? Supplier performance measurement includes the methods and systems to
</p>
<p>Although the Honda approach may seem extreme to some, few can argue with the company&rsquo;s
demonstrated success. Automobiles produced at its Ohio assembly plants have consistently
been among the highest-quality and best-selling in the United States. The success of Hon-
da&rsquo;s supplier development and improvement effort is one reason the company enjoys such
loyal customers.

<p>collect and provide information to measure, rate, or rank supplier performance on a
continuous basis. The supplier measurement system is a critical part of the sourcing
process&mdash;essentially serving as a supplier&rsquo;s report card. Note that supplier perfor-
mance measurement differs from the process used to initially evaluate and select a
supplier. It is a continuous process as opposed to a unique, one-time event.
</p>
<p>Supplier Measurement Decisions
Organizations face several key decisions when developing a supplier measurement
</p>
<p>system that are critical to the final design, implementation, and effectiveness of the
system.
</p>
<p>What to Measure
Central to the design of all supplier measurement systems is the decision about
</p>
<p>what to measure and how to weigh various performance categories. An organization
must decide which performance criteria are objective (quantitative) and which are
subjective (qualitative), as the metrics will be different between the two. Most of the
objective, quantitative variables lie within the following three categories:
</p>
<p>&bull; Delivery performance: Purchase orders or material releases sent to a supplier
have a quantity and a materials due date. A buyer can assess how well a sup-
plier satisfies its quantity and due-date commitments. Quantity, lead time re-
quirements, and due-date compliance also define a supplier&rsquo;s overall delivery
performance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quality performance: Almost all supplier measurement systems include qual-
ity performance as a critical component. Review Chapter 8 for a more in-
depth discussion of supplier quality management. A buyer can evaluate a
supplier&rsquo;s quality performance against previously specified objectives, track
trends and improvement rates, and compare similar suppliers. A well-
designed measurement system also helps define a buyer&rsquo;s quality require-
ments and effectively communicates them to its suppliers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost reduction: Buyers frequently rely on suppliers for cost-reduction assis-
tance, which can be measured in a number of ways. One common method
is to track a supplier&rsquo;s real cost after adjustment for inflation. Other ac-
cepted techniques involve comparing a supplier&rsquo;s cost against other suppli-
ers within the same industry or against a baseline or target price. Some
leading companies use the last price paid in a year as the baseline price for
comparisons during the next year.
</p>
<p>Buyers can also use a number of qualitative factors to assess supplier performance.
Exhibit 9.1 on p. 310 details some of the qualitative service factors available to buyers.
Although these factors are largely subjective, a buyer can still assign a score or rating
to each factor. A buyer might evaluate five different qualitative factors (assume equal
weighting for simplicity) along a five-point scale. The system adds the five scores and
divides by the total possible points to arrive at a percentage of total points, so that a
buyer can rank suppliers by the percentage of total possible points earned.
</p>
<p>Measurement and Reporting Frequency
Two important issues relate to the regularity of measurement: reporting frequency
</p>
<p>to the buyer and reporting frequency to the supplier. A buyer (or someone responsi-
ble for the day-to-day management of suppliers) should receive a daily report sum-

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>marizing the previous day&rsquo;s activities. This report allows the buyer to scan incoming
receipt activity and should highlight past-due supplier receipts. A buyer should re-
ceive additional reports summarizing supplier performance on a weekly, monthly,
quarterly, and annual basis.
</p>
<p>Routine reporting of supplier performance relative to goal should happen monthly
or quarterly. Buyers should also meet with suppliers on at least an annual basis to re-
view actual performance results and identify improvement opportunities. However, a
buyer should never delay reporting a supplier&rsquo;s poor performance, particularly when
it adversely affects day-to-day operations. Poor performance must be addressed as
soon as it is recognized to avoid financial or operational repercussions.
</p>
<p>Uses of Measurement Data
A buyer can use the data gathered from its measurement system in a number of
</p>
<p>ways. The data can help identify those suppliers that are incapable of performing at
expected levels so that remedial action will be taken to get performance back to accept-
able levels or to find a new supplier. A measurement system also helps identify those
highly capable suppliers that may qualify for longer-term partnerships or designation
as preferred suppliers because of exemplary performance.
</p>
<p>Measurement data also support supply base rationalization and optimization ef-
forts. If suppliers do not improve performance to minimum acceptable levels, they
are not likely to remain part of the supply base over the long term. Another use of
supplier performance data includes determining a supplier&rsquo;s future purchase volume
based on its past performance rating. Some companies adjust their purchase volumes
periodically and reward better-performing suppliers with a higher share of purchase
requirements. Adjusting volumes between suppliers provides a financial incentive for
a supplier to meet or exceed the buyer&rsquo;s performance expectations.
</p>
<p>A major benefit from supplier measurement is that performance data allow the
buying organization to identify those areas requiring improvement. Buyers can also
use the data when making sourcing decisions. These become clearer when a buyer
has a reliable measurement system that rates and ranks a supplier&rsquo;s performance
against other suppliers or other established performance standards.

<p>Types of Supplier Measurement Techniques
All supplier measurement systems have some element of subjectivity. Even the im-
</p>
<p>plementation of a computerized measurement system will require subjective judg-
ment. What data to analyze, what metrics to use, what performance categories to
include, how to weight different categories, how often to generate performance re-
ports, and how to use the performance data are all subjective to some degree. More-
over, there are no hard rules regarding the specific categories to include in supplier
measurement systems; the choice will depend on what is strategically important to
the buyer.
</p>
<p>Organizations typically use one of three common measurement techniques or sys-
tems when evaluating supplier performance. Each system differs in its ease of use,
level of decision subjectivity, required system resources, and implementation cost. Ex-
hibit 9.2 compares the advantages and disadvantages of these three systems.
</p>
<p>Categorical System
A categorical system is the easiest and most basic measurement system to put in
</p>
<p>place, but it is also the most subjective as far as measuring supplier performance.
This system requires the assignment of a rating evaluation for each selected perfor-
mance category. Examples of ratings typically include: excellent, good, fair, and poor.
These subjective evaluations can be completed by the buyer, other internal users, or
some combination of both.
</p>
<p>The categorical approach is commonly used by smaller organizations because it is
both easy and relatively inexpensive to implement. Although the categorical approach
provides some structure to the measurement process, it does not provide sufficiently
detailed insight into a supplier&rsquo;s true performance. Furthermore, because categorical
systems often rely on manually collected data, an organization generates supplier

<p>performance reports less frequently than if an automated system existed. The reliabil-
ity of the categorical method is the lowest of the three measurement systems dis-
cussed here, which limits the value of this approach when assessing supplier
performance. There is often significant variance in the subjective ratings.
</p>
<p>Weighted-Point System
This approach overcomes some of the subjectivity of the categorical system. A
</p>
<p>weighted-point system weighs and quantifies scores across different performance cate-
gories. This approach usually features higher reliability and moderate implementation
costs.
</p>
<p>Weighted-point systems are also flexible&mdash;users can change the weights assigned
to each performance category or the performance categories themselves, depending
on what is most important to the buying organization. For example, the performance
categories and weights for an MRO distributor will likely differ from those for a sup-
plier furnishing production components.
</p>
<p>Several important issues must be understood regarding the use of weighted-point
systems. First, users must carefully select the key performance categories to measure.
Second, an organization must decide how to weight each performance category. Al-
though assigning weights is subjective, an organization can reach consensus about
how to weigh the performance categories through careful planning and involvement
from different functions. Third, a set of decision rules must be in place to compare a

<p>supplier&rsquo;s performance against a predetermined objective to provide a score for each
category.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 9.3 illustrates a sample weighted-point system based on a five-point scale,
where five is the highest possible score. The weighted-point plan should provide a
higher level of objectivity for most performance categories and evaluate supplier per-
formance in more detail compared with the categorical approach. Note that actual rat-
ing scales will be much more detailed than the one presented in this exhibit.
</p>
<p>Cost-Based System
The most thorough and least subjective of the three measurement systems is the
</p>
<p>cost-based system. This approach seeks to quantify the total cost of doing business
with a supplier, as the lowest purchase price is not always the lowest total cost for an
item or service.
</p>
<p>Most companies with information system capability can readily implement a cost-
based supplier measurement system. The major challenge involves identifying and re-
cording appropriate costs that result whenever a supplier fails to perform as ex-
pected. To use such a system, an organization must estimate or calculate the
additional costs that result whenever a supplier underperforms. The basic logic of the
system is the calculation of a supplier performance index (SPI). This index, with a
base value of 1.0 that represents satisfactory performance, is a total cost index calcu-
lated for each item or commodity provided by a supplier:
</p>
<p>SPI &frac14; &eth;Total Purchases&thorn; Nonperformance Costs&THORN;=Total Purchases
Exhibit 9.4 illustrates a total cost&ndash;based approach for supplier measurement. The
</p>
<p>cost-based approach can also include an assessment of qualitative service factors to
provide a more complete picture of supplier performance. This exhibit compares the

Note that the lowest-price supplier, BC Techtronics, is not the lowest-total-cost sup-
plier when the costs of nonperformance are included. BC Techtronics also has a

<p>Exhibit 9.5 summarizes supplier performance for a group of items comprising a
single commodity. It details the total number of nonperformance occurrences, the
cost of each event as identified by the buyer, and the total nonperformance cost for
the quarter. Lines C and D include the figures required for the SPI calculation. Line
E is the ratio of points earned to the total possible points for the qualitative or ser-
vice factors.
</p>
<p>In many cases, the actual cost per nonperformance event may be difficult to esti-
mate or calculate, as the traditional cost accounting system is not designed to iden-
tify and capture such data. For instance, the average cost of a late delivery may vary
widely, depending on its impact to the customer, potential lost sales, line shutdown
costs, and so on. Therefore, many organizations get around this limitation by assign-
ing a standard charge each time a nonperformance event occurs.
</p>
<p>The SPI sometimes provides an incomplete or misleading assessment of supplier
performance. For example, consider a supplier that delivers $100,000 of material,
with one late delivery charged at $5,000. That supplier will have an SPI of ($100,000
+ $5,000)/$100,000, or 1.05. This SPI appears more favorable than that of a supplier
that delivers only $30,000 of material and has one late delivery, and that also charged
at $5,000. The second supplier has an SPI of ($30,000 + $5,000)/$30,000, or 1.17. Al-
though both suppliers committed the same infraction, the smaller supplier received a

<p>comparatively more severe penalty relative to purchase volume. A normalization ad-
justment (Q) is required to eliminate a bias that favors higher-dollar-volume suppli-
ers. Exhibit 9.6 illustrates how to calculate an SPI with the Q adjustment factor,
which allows an &ldquo;apples-to-apples&rdquo; comparison between suppliers.
</p>
<p>Management has many uses for the data derived from a comprehensive cost-
based supplier measurement system. Such a system provides necessary information
that a buyer may need to justify buying from a preferred supplier despite a higher
unit price. The system also allows a buyer to communicate the cost of specific nonper-
formance occurrences to a supplier, which then helps identify improvement opportu-
nities. Quantifying nonperformance costs can also result in a chargeback to the
offending supplier for unplanned costs. Finally, a buyer can use this data to identify
longer-term sources of supply based on a supplier&rsquo;s total cost performance history.
</p>
<p>Each of the three types of measurement approaches featured in this chapter, al-
though differing in their complexity and scope of use, raises a buyer&rsquo;s awareness
about supply base performance. Supplier measurement is a powerful tool for manag-
ing and increasing the capabilities of the supply base.
</p>

<p>Q is a normalization factor that eliminates high-dollar lot biases.

Consider the following information for Suppliers A, B, and C, each with a single late delivery nonconformance calculated at $4,000.

</p>
<p>Notice how different the SPI values are for the three suppliers, even though they each committed the same nonconformance. Supplier C,
due to the high lot bias, has the lowest SPI.
</p>
<p>SPI calculation with Q adjustment = Cost of material + (Nonconformance costs &times; Q factor)/Cost of material
</p>
<p>Supplier A: $10,000 + ($4,000 &times; .2)/$10,000 = 1.08
</p>
<p>Supplier B: $20,000 + ($4,000 &times; .4)/$20,000 = 1.08
</p>
<p>Supplier C: $200,000 + ($4,000 &times; 4)/$200,000 = 1.08

<p>Rationalization and Optimization: Creating
a Manageable Supply Base
</p>
<p>Effective supplier management and development begins by determining an optimal
number of suppliers that an organization should maintain. Supply base rationalization
is the process of identifying how many and which suppliers a buyer will maintain. Sup-
ply base optimization involves an analysis of the supply base to ensure that only the
most capable suppliers are kept in the supply base as it is rationalized. It often in-
volves eliminating those suppliers that are unwilling or incapable of achieving supply
management performance objectives, either currently or expected in the near future.
</p>
<p>Supply base rationalization and optimization should be a continuous process. The
elimination of both marginal and small-purchase-volume suppliers is usually the first
phase of the rationalization process. Subsequent optimization requires the replace-
ment of good suppliers with better-performing suppliers or initiating supplier develop-
ment projects with existing suppliers to improve performance. Organizations must
develop supplier evaluation and measurement systems to identify the best-perform-
ing suppliers and then develop stronger business relationships with those suppliers.
Oftentimes, companies must search worldwide for the best suppliers.
</p>
<p>During the early phases of supply base rationalization and optimization, the pro-
cess usually results in an absolute reduction in the total number of suppliers. Reduc-
tion, however, may not always be the result for every family or group of purchased
items. The key is to determine the right number of suppliers, not just arbitrarily cut

<p>McDonald&rsquo;s Takes
Supplier Measurement
Seriously
</p>
<p>To measure supplier performance, McDonald&rsquo;s (Oak Brook, IL) recently employed a sup-
plier relationship management (SRM) process to its global technology buy. According to Jo-
seph Youssef, McDonald&rsquo;s SRM strategy &ldquo;requires dedicated supply managers, effective
processes to create standardized best practices, and tools to track and evaluate the re-
sults.&rdquo; Youssef also indicates that an organization must manage its supply base through ef-
fective performance measurement and then make supplier-related decisions using the
outputs of those measurements. He outlines four prime measurements that organizations
should consider in their supplier performance management systems. The first area includes
day-to-day tactical measurements such as quality, service, responsiveness, and delivery per-
formance. The second measurement focuses on contract management: making sure that pre-
viously agreed-to contractual arrangements are followed. The third area measured is
financial management. Measurements in this area track to see that accurate invoices are sub-
mitted in a timely manner and for the agreed-upon products and services. Lastly, the fourth
measurement centers on the buyer-supplier relationship and the level of two-way communica-
tion between the parties.

<p>down on the number. For example, a truck assembly plant in Michigan received tires
and wheels from separate suppliers. OEM employees mounted and balanced the tires
on the wheels inside the assembly plant in a labor- and space-intensive operation.
The buyer established a new supplier near the assembly plant that then received both
the tires and wheels, and assembled, balanced, and stored the wheel assemblies until
shipping them to the assembly plant on a just-in-time basis. Although the company
added an additional supplier to its supply base, overall system efficiency increased,
and total cost declined. In this example, the optimization process resulted in the net
addition of a supplier.
</p>
<p>Advantages of a Rationalized and Optimized
Supply Base
</p>
<p>Supply base rationalization and optimization should result in real improvements
in cost, quality, delivery, and information sharing between buyer and supplier. Be-
cause the process identifies the best suppliers in terms of number and quality, the re-
maining suppliers are often capable of performing additional tasks that improve
performance or add value to the buyer-supplier relationship. Suppliers in an opti-
mized supply base often develop longer-term relationships with buyers, which can
lead to further joint improvement efforts.
</p>
<p>Buying from World-Class Suppliers
Because of the correlation between supplier performance and supply chain suc-
</p>
<p>cess, it is not difficult to see why choosing and maintaining only the best suppliers
supports higher performance throughout the supply chain. Instead of being responsi-
ble for literally hundreds or thousands of suppliers, supply management can concen-
trate on developing closer relationships with a smaller core group of qualified sup-
pliers. The benefits of doing business with world-class suppliers include fewer quality
and delivery problems, access to leading-edge technology, opportunities to develop
collaborative relationships, and a lower product cost as supply management and
engineering gain key supplier input during new-product development.
</p>
<p>Use of Full-Service Suppliers
The remaining suppliers in a rationalized and optimized supply base are often
</p>
<p>larger on average and highly capable of offering a broad range of value-adding ser-
vices. When a buyer uses full-service suppliers, it expects to reap substantial benefits
in the form of access to the supplier&rsquo;s engineering, research and development, design,
testing, production, service, and tooling capabilities. The full-service supplier ap-
proach places a greater burden on a supplier to manage an entire system of compo-
nents, activities, and services, as well as to effectively manage its own supply base.
The full-service supplier can also perform complete design and build work instead of
the buyer performing the work internally or using several different suppliers in an un-
coordinated effort.
</p>
<p>The automobile industry provides many examples of how full-service suppliers
can provide these benefits. For example, all vehicles have extensive electrical wiring
systems. Traditionally, automobile manufacturers designed each individual wiring har-
ness internally and sent the design specifications to suppliers through a competitive
bidding process. It was not uncommon to have 10 different suppliers working on wir-
ing systems for final assembly into a vehicle. Now, a single supplier, or only a few
suppliers, might design and produce the entire wiring system for a new vehicle
throughout the entire model life cycle. The result is lower cost, improved quality, and

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>reduced product development time. Because of its expertise, a supplier can design the
wiring systems concurrently with the overall design of the car, reducing concept-to-
customer cycle time.
</p>
<p>Reduction of Supply Base Risk
At first glance, it seems illogical that using fewer suppliers can result in reduced
</p>
<p>supply base risk. Risk can be defined as the magnitude of exposure to financial loss
or operational disruption and stems from uncertainty. What if the single or sole
source for a critical item goes on strike or has a fire at its production facility, disrupt-
ing its production process and ability to maintain an uninterrupted flow of materials?
Historically, the risk of supply disruption has been the primary argument against sup-
ply base reduction or single-sourcing of purchased items.
</p>
<p>Many buyers have now concluded that, if they select suppliers carefully and de-
velop close and collaborative working relationships with fewer suppliers, supply risk
can actually decrease. Risk does not only include supply disruption. Other supply
risks include poor supplier quality, poor delivery performance, or overpaying for
items due to a noncompetitive sourcing situation. However, maintaining multiple sup-
pliers for each item can actually increase the probability and level of risk. Having
more suppliers for individual items creates the opportunity for increased product vari-
ability or inconsistent quality across the supply chain.
</p>
<p>Lower Supply Base Administrative Costs
Buyers interact with their suppliers in many ways. Examples include contacting
</p>
<p>suppliers about design and material specifications, communicating quality and other
performance requirements, negotiating purchase contracts, visiting and evaluating
supplier facilities and processes, providing feedback about supplier performance,
collaborating with suppliers when problems occur, requesting supplier input about
product design, contacting suppliers regarding engineering change orders, and trans-
mitting material releases. These activities all have associated costs in terms of time,
effort, and potential for miscommunication. For example, the administrative cost of
maintaining 5,000 suppliers will be dramatically higher than the cost of maintaining
a core group of 500 highly qualified suppliers. Furthermore, highly qualified suppliers
require fewer problem-related interactions with the buyer. The best contacts between
a buyer and seller are those that add value to the relationship rather than merely re-
solve problems.
</p>
<p>Lower Total Product Cost
During the 1980s, buyers recognized the real cost of maintaining multiple suppli-
</p>
<p>ers for each sourced item. Acquisition and operating costs increased as a result of
greater variability in product quality and delivery and smaller production volumes of-
fered to each supplier, which did nothing to spread out the supplier&rsquo;s fixed costs over
higher output levels. Short-term purchase contracts that award small volumes of busi-
ness to multiple suppliers only increase production costs and provide no incentive
for investments in process improvement. It became evident that, if fewer suppliers re-
ceived larger-volume contracts, the resulting economies of scale would lower produc-
tion and distribution costs. Supply base rationalization and optimization provides the
opportunity to achieve lower total product costs by awarding larger volumes to fewer
suppliers.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Ability to Pursue Complex Supply Management Strategies
Implementing complex supply management strategies requires a rationalized and
</p>
<p>optimized supply base. The need for more complicated activities with suppliers re-
quires a reduced supply base due to higher levels of two-way interactions between a
buyer and seller. Examples of complex supply management strategies include sup-
plier development, early supplier design involvement, just-in-time sourcing, and the
development of cost-based pricing agreements with suppliers.
</p>
<p>Possible Risks of Maintaining Fewer Suppliers
Few supply management executives would argue in favor of maintaining multiple
</p>
<p>suppliers for every purchased item. Currently, the debate centers on maintaining a
limited number of qualified suppliers for major items versus using a single source.
Some organizations believe using several suppliers for a purchased item promotes
and maintains a healthy level of competition between suppliers. Others, however, be-
lieve that a single source can still deliver cost and quality improvements over the life
of a contract if a buyer manages that supplier appropriately. Although most buyers
recognize the benefits of supply base rationalization and optimization, there are still
potential risks from relying on a smaller supply base.
</p>
<p>Supplier Dependency
Some buyers fear that a supplier can become too dependent on the buyer for its
</p>
<p>economic survival. This situation can easily occur if a buyer combines its total pur-
chase volumes for an item with a single supplier. A smaller supplier with limited ca-
pacity may need to eliminate some existing customers in order to meet the increased
requirements of its larger customer. As a result, the supplier may become too depen-
dent on a buyer for its financial well-being. If, for some reason, the buyer no longer re-
quires a particular item, the overly dependent supplier may no longer be financially
viable. Although supply base optimization can lead to a beneficial mutual commit-
ment between buyer and seller, it can also result in an unhealthy dependence of one
party on the other.
</p>
<p>Absence of Competition
By relying on only one or a limited number of suppliers, some buyers fear losing
</p>
<p>the advantages of a competitive marketplace. A supplier may hold the buyer hostage
by unduly raising its prices or becoming too complacent. The more difficult and ex-
pensive it is to change suppliers (e.g., higher switching costs), the more likely this sce-
nario becomes. However, organizations with substantial supply base optimization
experience argue that careful supplier selection and the development of equitable con-
tracts that address continuous improvement requirements should prevent an over-reli-
ance on suppliers that try to take advantage of a single-source situation.
</p>
<p>Supply Disruption
Supply disruption is a potential risk when sourcing from a single-location sup-
</p>
<p>plier. In 1999, a major earthquake in Taiwan disrupted the supply of computer chips
in the global semiconductor industry. Chip fabrication plants were shut down for sev-
eral days, and the normal level of output was curtailed for several weeks. Customers
reacted by hoarding chip inventories and reducing their production of finished S

<p>goods. Suppliers not affected by the quake increased their prices, resulting in a ripple
effect throughout the electronics industry.2 Likewise, labor strikes, fires, acts of na-
ture, production or quality problems, or disruption within the supplier&rsquo;s own supply
base can disrupt the smooth flow of materials through a supply chain. Buyers can
minimize this risk by sourcing from a single supplier with multiple production facili-
ties. For example, Dell Computer utilizes multiple sourcing for many of the key com-
ponents that go into its notebook computers manufactured in Asia. If a disruption or
lack of capacity occurs at one supplier&rsquo;s facility, Dell can quickly shift its sourcing to
another facility from the same supplier or to a different supplier.3
</p>
<p>Another method for minimizing supply disruption risk is to select suppliers with
multiple capabilities&mdash;the practice of cross-sourcing. Here, a buyer selects or develops
suppliers with multiple or redundant capabilities. If problems occur with a primary
source of supply for an item, the secondary supplier, which is the supplier for an-
other purchased item, then assumes ownership of the sourcing process. This ap-
proach requires identifying suppliers capable of producing different items or
performing multiple functions throughout the production process.
</p>
<p>Overaggressive Supply Reduction
However, buyers can move too aggressively when reducing the supply base. If this
</p>
<p>occurs, the remaining suppliers may not have adequate capacity to meet purchase re-
quirements if demand increases substantially. This happened when a major producer
of hand tools developed a wide array of products that used rechargeable nickel-
cadmium batteries. The supplier found that it did not have adequate manufacturing
capacity to support new-product requirements for these batteries. In this case, supply
base optimization required the company to qualify new sources rather quickly. As
part of the supply base optimization process, the buyer must ensure that it carefully
evaluates the remaining suppliers&rsquo; capacity to produce larger volumes or develop
other suppliers to cover the increased volumes.
</p>
<p>Formal Approaches to Supply Base Rationalization
In his discussion of strategic supply management, Keki Bhote offers several possi-
</p>
<p>ble supply base reduction methods.4 Bhote&rsquo;s framework contains three primary ele-
ments: (1) phasing out current suppliers, (2) selection of finalist suppliers, and (3)
selection of partnership suppliers. This section focuses on several methods commonly
used to rationalize the supply base.
</p>
<p>Twenty/Eighty Rule
This approach identifies those 20% of suppliers receiving the bulk of purchase
</p>
<p>spend or that minority of suppliers that cause the most quality problems. Purchase
spend and supplier quality are two possible decision criteria used to identify suppli-
ers for elimination. Organizations often use this approach when they require a rapid
reduction in the number of suppliers. A disadvantage to the 20/80 approach is the pos-
sible elimination of otherwise capable suppliers simply because they received fewer
purchase dollars. This approach assumes the best suppliers receive the majority of
the purchase dollars, which may not necessarily be true. In addition, the buyer may ex-
clude suppliers with needed capabilities that are not currently utilized.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ldquo;Improve or Else&rdquo; Approach
This approach provides all suppliers, regardless of their performance history, a
</p>
<p>chance to remain in the supply base. It involves notifying suppliers that they have a
specified period of time in which to meet new performance requirements&mdash;from im-
proved quality levels and delivery performance to lead time and cost reductions, or
any other key performance indicator. Suppliers that fall short of expectations may
soon become ex-suppliers. Although this approach has the potential for driving rapid
performance improvement in the supply base, it can also be a heavy-handed way of
dealing with suppliers. For example, this was the approach that General Motors&rsquo;
chief purchasing officer, J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, used in 1992 by demanding
that GM&rsquo;s suppliers reduce their prices by 3 to 22% or risk losing their existing sup-
ply contracts.5
</p>
<p>Triage Approach
This approach requires the systematic evaluation of the performance of individual
</p>
<p>suppliers and placement into one of three categories. The first category, and most
likely the largest, includes those suppliers that are marginal performers or otherwise
incapable of meeting purchase performance requirements, now or in the future. The
buyer targets these suppliers for immediate removal from the supply base. The sec-
ond category includes those suppliers that do not consistently meet purchase require-
ments in all areas but demonstrate sufficient improvement potential. The most

<p>promising of these suppliers are often targets for supplier assistance and develop-
ment. The third category includes those high-quality, capable suppliers requiring no
improvement assistance. These suppliers are candidates for more collaborative buyer-
seller relationships, which may include offering longer-term contracts in exchange for
continuous improvement, as well as being considered for an alliance. The distribu-
tion of suppliers across these categories may vary across industries.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 9.7 on p. 321 illustrates one company&rsquo;s triage approach to supplier reduc-
tion. This company compares suppliers against various performance criteria and seg-
ments the supply base into three groups: unacceptable performers, suppliers that
meet minimum requirements but are not world class, and world-class performers
worthy of closer relationships.
</p>
<p>Competency Staircase Approach
This method requires suppliers to successfully navigate a succession of perfor-
</p>
<p>mance milestones or hurdles in order to remain in the supply base. First, all sup-
pliers must meet a buyer&rsquo;s basic quality standards for consideration as potential
suppliers. Suppliers must then pass a series of hurdles analogous to climbing a stair-
case. Each hurdle brings the supplier one step closer to its ultimate goal of remaining
in the buyer&rsquo;s supply base.
</p>
<p>The next hurdle may be a supplier&rsquo;s ability to meet a buyer&rsquo;s technical specifica-
tions and product performance requirements. Subsequent hurdles can include demon-
strating sustained production competency, delivery capability (such as just-in-time
requirements), willingness to share information, supplier size, and physical proximity
to the buyer. Note that different purchase requirements will present varying sets of
hurdles. Each hurdle results in fewer and fewer suppliers remaining in the supply
base. The result is a strong and flexible supply base comprised of highly capable and
motivated suppliers.
</p>
<p>Summary of Supplier Rationalization and Optimization
Several conclusions about supplier rationalization and optimization can now be
</p>
<p>made. First, there are a variety of approaches to supply base rationalization and opti-
mization. This chapter provides only a select sample of those approaches. Further-
more, an organization can combine more than one approach to meet its supply base
reduction goals. Second, we do not have to limit our evaluation only to suppliers cur-
rently in the supply base. A buyer should always be open to the possibility of adding
new suppliers if their use makes good business sense. Third, the benefits of supply
base rationalization and optimization are real, whereas the potential drawbacks are
manageable.
</p>
<p>Supply base rationalization and optimization constitutes a critical first step toward
the effective management and development of the supply base. It is difficult to man-
age many suppliers as efficiently as a small core group of suppliers, just as it is chal-
lenging to pursue progressive supply management strategies with too many suppliers.
A large supply base also means the duplication of a wide range of supply manage-
ment activities, adding to acquisition cost without a corresponding increase in value
added. Finally, supplier rationalization and optimization is a continuing activity. Al-
most half of the companies participating in a 2000 survey reduced their supply base
by 20%, and almost 15% reduced their supply base between 20 and 60% over the last

<p>In keeping with Raytheon&rsquo;s corporate goals, Stewart&rsquo;s organization is applying Six Sigma qual-
ity approaches to the company&rsquo;s supplier development activities. He has also assembled a
network of Raytheon Six Sigma champions to work directly with suppliers. The Raytheon pro-
cess for supplier development has six steps:
</p>
<p>1. Identify supplier candidates for projects.
2. Define objectives and resources.
3. Baseline the opportunities and rank.
4. Analyze selected opportunities.
5. Implement projects.
6. Document and realize improvements.
</p>
<p>When identifying suppliers, Stewart says he does not want his organization to select only sup-
pliers &ldquo;that are broken. We think we can work Six Sigma with suppliers at the higher end as
well as the low end. On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t want suppliers to think we are using it just
to attack the small and mid-size suppliers. We are going to use it across the supplier base.
Six Sigma is a continuous-improvement or problem-solving tool, and all relationships have
problems.&rdquo; Stewart says he is looking to identify not only the right suppliers for the process
but also the right projects within those suppliers.
</p>
<p>Another area where Raytheon is committed to improvement is its use of disadvantaged suppli-
ers, some of whom are ideal candidates for supplier development. As a company, Raytheon
has a series of comprehensive goals for small, women- and minority-owned supplier
businesses.
</p>
<p>For women owners of small businesses, the company held a Women&rsquo;s Business Forum that
linked women business owners with female executives within Raytheon. Through the initia-
tive, &ldquo;we developed corporate relationships through which our executives mentored the
women small business leaders. As we rationalize our supplier base, we don&rsquo;t want to leave
some of these businesses behind,&rdquo; says Stewart. &ldquo;So, we are bringing them along with us.&rdquo;
To this end, his supply chain organization has a good record of creating opportunity for
small businesses.

<p>Supplier Development: A Strategy for Improvement
The first documented applications of supplier development came from Toyota, Nis-
</p>
<p>san, and Honda, some as early as 1939. Toyota&rsquo;s 1939 Purchasing Rules discussed the
need to treat its suppliers as an integral part of Toyota and to work together to im-
prove their collective performance. Nissan implemented its first supplier development
efforts in 1963, with Honda joining the club as a result of the first Arab oil embargo
in 1973.7 However, the rest of the world has been slow to take up the supplier develop-
ment banner.8 Even the United Nations has recognized the need for supplier develop-
ment; its Guide to Supplier Development is designed to improve the skills, capacities,
and competitiveness of global industrial subcontracting and partnership exchanges.9
</p>
<p>Although the concept was mentioned in several early purchasing books, early
North American writings on supplier development began in earnest with researcher
Michiel Leenders.10 As broadly defined by a number of authors, supplier develop-
ment is any activity undertaken by a buyer to improve a supplier&rsquo;s performance or
capabilities to meet the buyer&rsquo;s short- and long-term supply needs. Organizations
rely on a variety of activities to improve supplier performance, including sharing
technology, providing incentives to suppliers for improved performance, promoting

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>competition among suppliers, providing necessary capital, and directly involving
its personnel with suppliers through activities such as training and process
improvement.11
</p>
<p>Direct involvement in a supplier&rsquo;s operations by buyer personnel is undoubtedly
the most challenging part of any supplier development process. Not only must inter-
nal management and employees be convinced that investing scarce company re-
sources in an outside supplier&rsquo;s operation is a worthwhile risk, but the supplier must
be convinced it is in its own best interest to accept direction and assistance. Too of-
ten, the supplier is convinced that the only reason a buyer wants to engage in sup-
plier development is to pressure the supplier to pass along all of the savings
generated by reducing its price. Even if a mutual understanding of the importance of
supplier development is reached, there is still the matter of implementation and alloca-
tion of needed resources by both parties, as well as ensuring that the implementation
is maintained over time. Effective supplier development requires the commitment of
financial capital and human resources, skilled personnel, timely and accurate informa-
tion sharing, and performance measurement.
</p>
<p>A Process Map for Supplier Development
After reviewing the strategies for more than 60 organizations, we have developed a
</p>
<p>generic process map for deploying a supplier development initiative, as shown in Ex-
hibit 9.8.12 Although many organizations have successfully deployed the first four stages
of the process, some have been less successful in implementing the latter four stages.
</p>
<p>Step 1&mdash;Identify Critical Commodities for Development
Not all organizations must pursue supplier development. An organization may al-
</p>
<p>ready be sourcing from world-class suppliers due to its existing strategic supplier selec-
tion processes, or it may buy external inputs only in a very small proportion to total
costs or sales. Therefore, supply managers must analyze their own individual sourc-
ing situations to determine if a particular supplier&rsquo;s level of performance warrants de-
velopment, and if so, which specific commodities and services will require attention.
</p>
<p>Senior supply managers should thoroughly consider the following questions to de-
termine if a given supplier warrants development effort.13 A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; response to a major-
ity of these questions suggests a need for supplier development.
</p>
<p>&bull; Do externally purchased products and services account for more than 50%
of product or service value?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the supplier an existing or potential source of competitive advantage?
</p>
<p>&bull; Do you currently purchase or plan to purchase on the basis of total cost
versus initial purchase price?
</p>
<p>&bull; Can existing suppliers meet your competitive needs five years from now?
</p>
<p>&bull; Do you need suppliers to be more responsive to your needs?
</p>
<p>&bull; Are you willing and able to become more responsive to your suppliers&rsquo;
needs?
</p>
<p>&bull; Do you plan to treat suppliers as partners in your business?
</p>
<p>&bull; Do you plan to develop and maintain open and trusting relations with your
suppliers?
</p>
<p>A corporate-level executive steering committee should then develop an assessment
of the relative importance of all purchased goods and services to identify where to

<p>Chapter 9 Supplier Management and Development 325</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>focus any supplier development efforts. The result of this assessment is a portfolio
analysis of those critical products or services that are essential for marketplace suc-
cess. This discussion is an extension of the company&rsquo;s overall corporate-level strate-
gic planning process and must include participants from other critical functions
affected by sourcing decisions, including finance, sales and marketing, information
technology, accounting, engineering, production, and design.
</p>
<p>Step 2&mdash;Identify Critical Suppliers for Development
The supply base performance assessment system helps identify those suppliers
</p>
<p>within a commodity group that would be targeted for development. A common ap-
proach involves a routine analysis of current supplier performance. As shown in
Exhibit 9.7, leading companies regularly monitor supplier performance on a facility-
by-facility basis and rank suppliers from best to worst. Suppliers failing to meet pre-
determined minimum performance standards in quality, delivery, cycle time, late
deliveries, total cost, service, safety, or environmental compliance are potential candi-
dates for elimination from the supply base. If the supplier&rsquo;s product or service is essen-
tial, it should be considered for supplier development. Those suppliers that meet
minimum requirements but do not provide world-class performance are the most
likely candidates for development efforts. Benchmarking and Pareto analysis are two
sourcing tools that can assist in the identification of possible supplier development
targets.
</p>
<p>Step 3&mdash;Form Cross-Functional Development Team
Before approaching suppliers and asking for improved performance, it is critical
</p>
<p>to develop cross-functional consensus and support from within for the initiative. Sup-
ply management executives continually emphasize that supply base improvement be-
gins from within through buyer-focused activities&mdash;that is, the buying company must
have its own house in order before expecting commitment and cooperation from sup-
pliers. Development teams typically include members from engineering, operations,
quality, and supply management.
</p>
<p>Step 4&mdash;Meet with Supplier&rsquo;s Top Management Team
Once the development team&rsquo;s charter is established and an appropriate supplier
</p>
<p>has been identified for improvement, the team should approach the supplier&rsquo;s top
management team and establish three relational building blocks for seeking supplier
improvement: strategic alignment, measurement, and professionalism. Strategic align-
ment requires a business and technology alignment between the companies. It also
requires alignment about key customer needs throughout the supply chain. Measure-
ment requires an objective means of accurately assessing development results and
progress in a timely manner. By approaching the supplier&rsquo;s top management with a
solid and mutually beneficial business case for improvement, the demonstrated profes-
sionalism of all parties helps to establish a positive tone, reinforce collaboration, fos-
ter two-way communication, and develop mutual trust.
</p>
<p>Step 5&mdash;Identify Opportunities and Probability for Improvement
At these meetings with the supplier&rsquo;s senior management, supply management ex-
</p>
<p>ecutives should identify areas earmarked for improvement. Companies adopting a
strategic approach to supply base development can usually agree upon the areas for

<p>326 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>improvement. In some cases, such areas are driven by final customer requirements
and expectations.
</p>
<p>Step 6&mdash;Define Key Metrics and Cost-Sharing Mechanisms
Development opportunities, although not necessarily specific improvement proj-
</p>
<p>ects, are evaluated next in terms of project feasibility and potential return on invest-
ment. The parties jointly determine if the opportunities for improvement are realistic
and achievable and, if so, then establish measures and improvement goals. The buyer
and seller must also agree on how to divide or share the costs and benefits from the
development project. A common sharing arrangement is 50/50, but the actual cost/
benefit sharing must take each party&rsquo;s level of investment into consideration.
</p>
<p>Step 7&mdash;Reach Agreement on Key Projects and Joint Resource
Requirements
</p>
<p>After identifying specific improvement projects to pursue, the parties must iden-
tify the resources necessary to carry out the project or development effort and make
the commitment to employ them. The parties also need to reach agreement regard-
ing the specific measures and metrics that will demonstrate success. These measures
may include a defined percentage improvement in cost savings, quality, delivery or cy-
cle time, or any other area relevant to supply chain performance. The most critical
component of supplier development is that it must contain realistic and visible mile-
stones and time horizons for improvement. What gets measured is usually what gets
accomplished. The agreement should also specify the role of each party, who is re-
sponsible for the outcomes of the project, and the manner and timing for deploying al-
ready agreed-upon resources.
</p>
<p>Step 8&mdash;Monitor Status of Projects and Modify Strategies as Appropriate
Progress must be monitored routinely after initiating a development project. More-
</p>
<p>over, an ongoing, two-way exchange of information is needed to maintain project mo-
mentum. This can be achieved by creating visible milestones for objectives, posting
progress, and creating new or revised objectives based on actual progress. Ongoing
project management may require modifying the original plan, applying additional re-
sources, developing new information, or refocusing priorities depending on events.
</p>
<p>Supplier Development Efforts That Sometimes
Don&rsquo;t Work
</p>
<p>Evidence indicates that supplier development projects work&mdash;at least some of the
time. Exhibit 9.9 on p. 328 presents the results of a comprehensive study of supplier
development efforts and clearly indicates that, although there is no guarantee that
comparable supplier development efforts will be equally successful, on average the de-
velopment process produces substantial results. This does not mean that there are no
barriers and challenges to successful supplier development. In fact, other studies have
found these barriers to be very real. The next section describes some of the proven
techniques and tools used by leading-edge companies to address the problems or bar-
riers that may contribute to less-than-desired supplier development effectiveness.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Overcoming the Barriers to Supplier Development
Barriers to supplier development fall into three classifications: (1) buyer-specific
</p>
<p>barriers, (2) buyer-supplier interface barriers, and (3) supplier-specific barriers. Com-
panies can use a variety of approaches to overcome barriers to supplier development.
In general, these approaches fall into one of three categories:
</p>
<p>&bull; Direct-involvement activities (hands-on): Companies often send their own
personnel in to assist suppliers. These efforts are characterized as hands-on
activities, where the buyer&rsquo;s representatives are directly involved in correct-
ing supplier problems and increasing capabilities. An example would be the
buyer assigning one of its process engineers to the supplier&rsquo;s facility to assist
in physically rearranging its equipment to be more efficient.
</p>
<p>&bull; Incentives and rewards (the &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;): Companies also use incentives to en-
courage suppliers to improve, largely by means of their own efforts. For ex-
ample, a buyer might agree to increase future order volumes if the desired
performance improvement takes place within a specific time, or it could
hold an annual award ceremony to recognize the best suppliers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Warnings and penalties (the &ldquo;stick&rdquo;): In some cases, companies may with-
hold potential future business if a supplier&rsquo;s performance is deemed unac-
ceptable or if a lack of improvement is evident. Buyers may also use a
competitive marketplace to provide a viable threat or incentive to a poorly
performing supplier.
</p>
<p>In many cases, organizations employ a combination of these three strategies to
drive supplier improvement as quickly as possible, applying them judiciously in re-
sponse to a particular supplier&rsquo;s capabilities and needs. The following sections ad-
dress barriers to supplier development that are internal, external, or interface based,
and provide examples of how leading companies overcome these barriers.
</p>
<p>Buyer-Specific Barriers
A buying company will not engage in supplier development unless senior manage-
</p>
<p>ment recognizes the need for or the benefits to be gained from an investment in sup-
plier development. Moreover, if supply management personnel have not already
rationalized and optimized its supply base as discussed above, the volume of pur-
chases with any particular supplier will likely not justify the joint investment. In addi-
tion, there may be a lack of top-level support for financing supplier development
efforts in terms of both dollars and time.

<p>Barrier: The Buying Company&rsquo;s Purchase Volume from the Supplier Does
Not Justify Development Investment
</p>
<p>Solution: Standardization and single-sourcing. Parts standardization across several
product lines is a way to increase total order volumes with suppliers, which may jus-
tify a development investment. For example, IBM&rsquo;s Networking Hardware Division,
which produces customized networking solutions for customers, is constantly striving
to increase its parts commonality. Currently, over 50% of purchased components for
major hardware projects contain unique items. If IBM personnel believe that using
customized components will provide a market advantage, they will continue to use
them. However, standardization remains an important way to leverage worldwide pur-
chase volume and shorten new-product development cycles.

<p>Guess Who&rsquo;s Getting into
Supplier Development?
The U.S. Air Force!
</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, the Manufacturing Technology Division (ManTech) of the U.S. Air
Force convened a meeting of 30 high-level supply management officials from various aero-
space and defense organizations to discuss plans for supply base development. The meeting
was an early step in a major ManTech initiative (dubbed the SME Initiative) that set a goal
for prime and subprime Air Force contractors to foster improvements among the small- or me-
dium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within their supply base. Underpinning the SME Initiative has
been research by a ManTech team indicating that up to 80% of production for most weap-
ons systems is now performed by suppliers, many of which are small- or medium-sized
companies.
</p>
<p>A study by the ManTech team identified a set of practices that better companies employed
with their suppliers (listed in order of popularity):
</p>
<p>1. Supplier training
2. Supplier rating, certification, and awards
3. Making customer technical expertise available to suppliers
4. Integrated customer/supplier teams to reduce supplier process waste and solve
</p>
<p>supplier problems
5. Supplier symposia and suggestion programs
6. Supplier continuous improvement programs
7. Supplier access to customer&rsquo;s volume discount rates
8. Structured methodology for problem solving
9. Integrated customer/supplier technology roadmaps
10. Customer development of a supplier&rsquo;s capability prior to outsourcing.
</p>
<p>Under the SME Initiative, ManTech identifies critical small suppliers for direct development
by either themselves or third-party consultants and incentives for prime contractors and sub-
system producers to pursue supplier development policies. The U.S. Air Force knows that sup-
plier development is essential to the success of future weapons programs.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Concurrent with component standardization, many supply managers also plan to
reduce their supply base, wherever possible, to achieve economies of scope and scale.
Daewoo Corporation, for example, uses single-sourcing wherever possible, relying on
two or more suppliers only in situations with high potential for labor disputes. Simi-
larly, NCR, Doosan Corporation of Korea, Honda of America Manufacturing, and Ro-
ver currently use single-sourcing or are planning to move in that direction.
</p>
<p>Barrier: No Immediate Benefit to Supplier Development Is Evident
to the Buying Organization
</p>
<p>Solution: Pursue small wins. Varity Perkins, a producer of diesel engines used in au-
tomotive and construction vehicles, found its initial supplier development efforts to
be relatively unsuccessful. This resulted in lowered internal expectations and damp-
ened enthusiasm for future development efforts. However, Varity personnel realized
that part of the problem was that they were trying to accomplish too much. Thus,
the company focused on a smaller group of suppliers for kaizen (or continuous im-
provement) efforts to gain a series of small wins and build momentum. Varity&rsquo;s kai-
zen approach achieved incremental improvements that ultimately gained renewed
internal commitment for the supplier development process.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Importance of Purchased Item Does Not Justify Development Efforts
Solution: Take a longer-term focus. Solectron, a contract manufacturer in the com-
</p>
<p>puter industry, has a competitive strategy that relies heavily on its supply chain man-
agement competencies. The company looks beyond the price of purchased inputs
and examines how its most important suppliers affect the quality and technology of
its products. Solectron expects its suppliers to provide designs offering integrated solu-
tions that Solectron engineers can use in future product designs. Total cost and long-
term strategic impact help justify ongoing investment in suppliers.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Lack of Executive Support within the Buying Organization
for Supplier Development
</p>
<p>Solution: Prove the benefits. Support for supplier development is gained when man-
agement becomes convinced that the company can improve if supplier performance
improves. For companies spending nearly 80% of their cost of goods sold on pur-
chased inputs, such an argument is easy to make. For companies with lower percen-
tages of purchased content, the argument may be more difficult. Proving a direct
relationship between supplier improvement and increased profits can be difficult to
achieve; someone within the supply management organization must document that
outcome. Managers also note that efforts to optimize their companies&rsquo; supply bases,
combined with part standardization, can help free up scarce resources over the long
term, making supplier development more palatable to internal skeptics. In addition,
the total cost approach to supplier performance measurement should also prove to
be an effective communication tool for demonstrating the deleterious effects of poor
supplier performance. However, many companies still view supplier development re-
sources simply as additional overhead costs rather than needed investment in supply
chain performance.

<p>330 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Buyer-Supplier Interface Barriers
Barriers to supplier development may also originate in the interface between the
</p>
<p>buyer and supplier in areas such as open communication, alignment of organiza-
tional cultures, and trust. A reluctance to share sensitive information about costs and
processes on the part of either buyer or supplier is one of the more significant inter-
face barriers.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Supplier Is Reluctant to Share Information on Costs or Processes
Solution: Create a supplier ombudsman. Honda of America has supplier ombuds-
</p>
<p>men who deal with the &ldquo;soft side&rdquo; of the business&mdash;primarily human resource issues
not usually associated with cost, quality, or delivery. Because the supplier ombuds-
man is not directly involved in sourcing contract negotiations, suppliers are often
much more willing to talk openly and honestly with the ombudsman, who can then
act as a liaison between the two companies. One ombudsman emphasized that it
takes time to build trust with suppliers, and trust building varies with different suppli-
ers. If a supplier approaches the ombudsman with a problem that is the result of
poor communication or misunderstanding between Honda and its supplier, the om-
budsman communicates the supplier&rsquo;s perspective to Honda while maintaining as
much confidentiality as possible. Over time, suppliers come to trust the ombudsman
and appear to be more willing to share proprietary information with the company.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Confidentiality Inhibits Information Sharing
Solution: Establish confidentiality agreements. Perhaps one of the biggest chal-
</p>
<p>lenges in developing suppliers is sharing confidential information, especially when
dealing with high-tech suppliers. Thus, many companies require nondisclosure or ex-
clusivity agreements (i.e., the supplier provides a specific product to only one buyer)
in development efforts, especially when dealing with technologically advanced prod-
ucts that contribute significantly to the buyer&rsquo;s competitiveness. However, nondisclo-
sure agreements can benefit both parties. Ethical behavior on the part of the buyer
will also support more open sharing of information with suppliers.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Supplier Does Not Trust the Buying Organization
Solution: Spell it out. The driving forces behind kaizen events at Varity Perkins in-
</p>
<p>dicate that the company will not run an event without a properly executed written
agreement between the parties. Although some supply management personnel at Var-
ity Perkins prefer a &ldquo;gentlemen&rsquo;s agreement,&rdquo; kaizen leaders believe the only way to
gain a supplier&rsquo;s trust is to have the terms specifically written out and signed, espe-
cially when conducting the first supplier development event at a supplier. In one in-
stance, it took Varity Perkins eight months to convince a supplier to consider a
kaizen workshop because the supplier felt that a similar event with a different com-
pany previously failed to yield any improvements. The trust problem was com-
pounded further because of Varity Perkins&rsquo; previous reputation for arm&rsquo;s-length
relationships with suppliers, manifested by frequent switching of suppliers based
solely on price. The company has moved aggressively to reverse this perception by im-
plementing and publicizing a new supply management philosophy emphasizing col-
laborative relationships with its suppliers.

<p>Barrier: Organizational Cultures Are Poorly Aligned
Solution: Adapt a new approach to local conditions. When setting up its U.S. auto
</p>
<p>assembly plant in South Carolina, BMW quickly realized it would have to change its
supplier development approach to conform to the North American supply market.
BMW uses a process consulting approach to supplier development in Germany,
which involves analyzing suppliers&rsquo; processes and telling them what is wrong. This ap-
proach works well in a mature supplier relationship, where the supplier intuitively un-
derstands what the customer wants because the parties have worked together over
time. In the United States, however, it became obvious that a very different approach
was required because those long-term relationships did not exist.
</p>
<p>When BMW started production, its U.S. suppliers frequently had difficulty under-
standing what was required in terms of quality and continuous improvement, result-
ing in strained relationships. Consequently, BMW spent a great deal of time
explaining and communicating its expectations to suppliers. Eventually, BMW pub-
lished a Supplier Partnership Manual that clearly delineated supplier responsibilities
and its own expectations. The company also held supplier seminars to present its
&ldquo;Roadmap to Quality.&rdquo; These efforts have helped align buyer-supplier expectations
and create a shared culture toward improvement.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Not Enough Inducements to Participate Are Provided to the Supplier
Solution: Designed-in motivation. Although Solectron is now generally able to of-
</p>
<p>fer large order volumes to suppliers, that was not always the case. To gain supplier co-
operation in the low-volume years, Solectron emphasized that a supplier could
become designed into its products and thus have a greater potential for future
business.
</p>
<p>Solution: Financial incentives. Hyundai Motor Company uses financial incentives
as one motivational tool for supplier improvement. The company rates supplier per-
formance from 1 (highest) to 4 (lowest). Class 1 suppliers receive cash immediately
on their invoices; Class 2 suppliers receive payment in 30 days; Class 3 suppliers re-
ceive payment in 60 days; and Class 4 suppliers receive no new business. Because all
suppliers know how Hyundai evaluates their performance, they can take the steps nec-
essary to ensure higher levels of performance.
</p>
<p>Supplier-Specific Barriers
Just as buyers sometimes fail to recognize the potential benefits accruing from sup-
</p>
<p>plier development, a lack of recognition by the supplier may also keep its top manage-
ment from fully committing to the joint effort. This lack of commitment may result
in a failure to implement improvement ideas or to provide the technical and human
resources necessary to support the development process. In addition, appropriate sup-
plier follow-up may not take place once the development project has been com-
pleted, and the supplier&rsquo;s performance may revert back to its previous level.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Lack of Commitment on the Part of Supplier&rsquo;s Management
Solution: Implement after commitment. Deere and Company&rsquo;s supplier develop-
</p>
<p>ment managers state that they will not engage in a supplier development project with
a supplier unless the supplier&rsquo;s management demonstrates full commitment to the
process. This involves a joint examination of the proposed improvement project and
determination of the potential costs and benefits. To do so, a supply manager from

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Deere arranges an initial contact meeting with the supplier&rsquo;s top local management
to obtain its commitment and involvement. To secure this, Deere&rsquo;s supplier develop-
ment engineers educate the supplier&rsquo;s management about the scope and impact of
the desired improvement efforts. Once the supplier&rsquo;s senior management agrees to
participate in principle, the supplier development engineer conducts process map-
ping, establishes the base case, and delineates the expected benefits hand in hand
with corresponding supplier personnel. Once Deere and the supplier agree to the
goals and objectives of the intended project, the next step is to determine how to
share the costs and benefits. Deere typically allows the supplier to recover up front
any capital-related costs required to implement the project and then splits the result-
ing savings 50/50 with the supplier, generally through a price decrease on future vol-
ume. By equitably sharing the resulting savings with the supplier, the supplier is
more willing to engage in future development projects. In addition, success stories
are shared with other possible supplier development targets to demonstrate the viabil-
ity of the development process.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Supplier&rsquo;s Management Agrees to Improvements but Fails
to Implement the Proposals
</p>
<p>Solution: Supplier champions. JCI Corporation, a first-tier supplier to the automo-
tive industry, has instituted a Supplier Champions Program (SCP) designed to ensure
suppliers are proficient in areas that are important to JCI&rsquo;s customers. The program
was initiated because many of the suppliers that had attended JCI&rsquo;s training sessions
failed to implement the tools and techniques that JCI provided. The SCP identifies
what supplier personnel need to implement after they return from training. The pro-
gram designates a Supplier Champion, a key supplier employee who understands
JCI&rsquo;s expectations and demonstrates a high level of competence. The certification pro-
cess requires that the Supplier Champion submit those actions to JCI that the sup-
plier has identified for improvement. Such actions might include process mapping,
failure mode effects analysis, quality control planning, best-practices benchmarking,
and process auditing.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Supplier Lacks Engineering Resources to Implement Solutions
Solution: Direct support. Honda of America Manufacturing has invested a sig-
</p>
<p>nificant amount of resources in its supplier support infrastructure, which was
highlighted in the chapter opening. Of the more than 300 people then in HAM&rsquo;s sup-
ply management department, 50 were supplier development engineers who worked ex-
clusively with suppliers. In one case, a small supplier did not have the capacity to
keep up with requested volume, resulting in quality deterioration. HAM stationed
four of its personnel at the supplier for 10 months at no charge, with additional ser-
vices offered on an as-needed basis. As a result, the supplier improved its perfor-
mance and now is a well-established Honda supplier.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Supplier Lacks Required Information Systems
Solution: Direct electronic data interchange (EDI) support. At NCR Corporation,
</p>
<p>a manufacturer of ATMs, managers note that access to timely and accurate informa-
tion is critical to decision making and ultimately to improved performance. An impor-
tant focus of NCR&rsquo;s supplier development program has been to get its suppliers to
invest in EDI. NCR also provides direct assistance to those suppliers producing
lower-level components that do not have sufficient resources to get online. In

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>addition, NCR provides training for suppliers and recommendations on hardware
and software purchases.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Suppliers Are Not Convinced Development Will Provide
Benefits to Them
</p>
<p>Solution: Let suppliers know where they stand. Varity Perkins revamped its sup-
plier evaluation system to show suppliers areas of potential improvement. Previously,
the company sent a quarterly report to suppliers assessing quality, delivery, and price
competitiveness performance. Perkins did not use the data in any manner, and as a re-
sult, suppliers did not take the assessments seriously. When revamping the system,
the measures were changed to capture the impact of supplier performance on daily
operations.
</p>
<p>Varity Perkins measured supplier delivery performance using a weekly time
bucket, and on-time performance averaged 90 to 95%. With a daily time bucket, on-
time performance dropped to 26% on time. Since the new measure has been in place,
daily on-time delivery has improved to 90%. The supplier&rsquo;s history, its performance
relative to Varity&rsquo;s other suppliers, and deviation from the mean in each evaluated
area also appear on the modified report. The report also uses more graphics to make
the data more meaningful.
</p>
<p>This measurement system has become the foundation for the company&rsquo;s supplier
development program. By allowing suppliers to view their performance relative to
competitors, the company expects that suppliers will see the potential benefits of par-
ticipating in supplier development activities as discussed earlier in the chapter.
</p>
<p>Barrier: Supplier Lacks Employee Skill Base to Implement Solutions
Solution: Establish training centers. JCI Corporation realized that some suppliers,
</p>
<p>particularly smaller ones, lacked the internal skills required to implement improve-
ment ideas. With this in mind, JCI built a facility dedicated to providing training to in-
ternal stakeholders, suppliers, and customers. Hyundai also established a domestic
training center to provide supplier personnel with training in key performance areas,
such as specialized welding. The suppliers and Hyundai share this cost. The South Ko-
rean government also supports this training center by providing tax benefits for build-
ing costs and making the joint training costs tax-deductible.
</p>
<p>Solution: Provide human resource support. Hyundai Corporation recognizes that
smaller suppliers with limited resources cannot consistently recruit and retain highly
skilled engineers and other critical employees. Therefore, the majority of Hyundai&rsquo;s
improvement efforts focus on smaller suppliers. Hyundai selects engineers from its
own shops to spend time at supplier facilities. The engineers are co-located with their
supplier counterparts, performing time/motion studies, teaching layout design, and
improving productivity. Suppliers are consistently encouraged to learn, apply, and
eventually teach the transferred knowledge to themselves and second-tier suppliers, a
train-the-trainer approach.
</p>
<p>Lessons Learned from Supplier Development
An underlying theme from these examples is that many of the barriers to supplier
</p>
<p>development are interrelated. It appears that, as companies work toward solving one
barrier, they make concurrent progress toward solving others. Therefore, we can dis-
cern several lessons from studying supplier development successes and failures.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1. Managerial attitudes are a common and difficult barrier to overcome. A sup-
ply management executive at Honda of America noted that, although quality
problems always have a solution, the attitudes of supplier management must
be right before a problem can be truly resolved. Suppliers are sometimes not
willing to accept outside help in the form of supplier development, either be-
cause they are too proud to accept help or because they do not see the value
in improving quality or delivery performance. Management attitudes signifi-
cantly affect the success of supplier development efforts. Oftentimes, suppliers
feel that the resources required for improvement come at the expense of other
needs. The savings must be real and readily achievable in order to get the sup-
plier to sign on.
</p>
<p>2. Realizing a competitive advantage from the supply chain requires a strategic
orientation toward supply chain management and the alignment of supply
management objectives with business unit goals. Supplier development plays a
major role in helping create sustainable competitive advantage while aligning
supply management and business goals. A strong supply management mis-
sion statement helps promote this strategic emphasis and alignment. Consider
the following supply management mission statement from an auto parts manu-
facturer in the U.K.:
</p>
<p>We are committed to procure goods and services in a way that de-
livers our aims and objectives of becoming the most successful auto
parts business in the world.
</p>
<p>The company pursues this mission through (1) development of a world-class
supplier base; (2) obtaining the highest-quality, most cost-effective goods and
services in a timely manner; and (3) establishing long-term relationships with
suppliers that strive for continuous improvement in all areas.
</p>
<p>3. Relationship management is critical to supplier development success. Buyers
can strengthen relationships with suppliers through focused supplier develop-
ment activities. Besides developing mutual trust, the participants within a sup-
ply chain can begin to truly understand each other&rsquo;s needs and requirements,
thereby making the entire supply chain stronger and more competitive. Ide-
ally, supplier development will lead to the recognition that there is a strong
co-destiny between buyer and supplier. Successful supplier development re-
quires a strong, collaborative relationship and mutual commitment between
the parties.
</p>
<p>Pursuing supplier development activities directly with suppliers is neither quick
nor easy. It requires vision, commitment, open communication, and equitable shar-
ing of costs and benefits to work effectively. The long-term objective, of course, is to
transform suppliers in such a way that continuous improvement becomes an integral
part of each supplier&rsquo;s culture and DNA. Such joint accomplishments are achieved
longitudinally and only by those companies that are patient and tenacious enough to
make supplier development an important part of their supplier management
processes.

<p>Good Practice
Example
</p>
<p>Supplier Measurement
Helps FedEx Manage a
Worldwide Supply Base
</p>
<p>FedEx, a worldwide leader in package delivery and logistics services, has built a solid
reputation for reliable, on-time service. Throughout its history (founded in 1971), FedEx has fo-
cused on operational excellence and the ability to consistently pick up, sort, and deliver pack-
ages on time to their final destination.
</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years, the package delivery industry has become highly competitive. Besides
FedEx, customers can select UPS, DHL, or the U.S. Postal Service to deliver their packages.
Even electronic mail is a source of new competition&mdash;senders simply attach large files with
their electronic messages instead of sending paper copies via the overnight letter pack.
FedEx must provide new services to customers, expand into new markets worldwide, and con-
trol costs if it expects to meet its growth targets.
</p>
<p>FedEx purchases billions of dollars of goods and services annually, making supply manage-
ment a major value-adding activity at the company. Furthermore, FedEx realizes that its sup-
pliers greatly affect total costs and the ability of FedEx to serve its shippers. For example, if
a supplier of aircraft replacement parts misses a delivery or ships defective parts, this af-
fects FedEx&rsquo;s ability to keep its planes flying safely and on time. To help in its supply chain
management efforts, the company has created a detailed supplier scorecard to evaluate sup-
plier performance for goods, services, and fuel.
</p>
<p>The FedEx supplier scorecard, available internally and to suppliers through the company intra-
net, establishes a level of uniformity among the many diverse supply management groups at
FedEx. Buyers or supply chain specialists maintain scorecards for the suppliers for which
they have responsibility. Completed scorecards are forwarded to a central database so they
can be reviewed for procedural compliance and maintenance. The database allows supply
chain specialists to perform a variety of analyses. For example, a supply manager can
quickly identify those suppliers failing to meet minimum delivery requirements. The ability to
perform this analysis greatly supports FedEx&rsquo;s supplier development and improvement
efforts.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 9.10 on p. 338 is an example of the supplier scorecard template that FedEx uses for
products. The original scorecard system also featured templates with separate scoring guide-
lines for service and fuel suppliers. These three categories are now combined into a single ro-
bust template. The scorecard system allows the individual responsible for managing the
supplier to adjust weights within the performance categories to meet the unique needs of a
purchase requirement. Besides adjusting the weights, users can also determine which catego-
ries and subitems within a category to include.
</p>
<p>Although the system offers the user substantial flexibility in selecting categories and
weights, several scorecard rules apply. First, the performance category titled Diverse Supplier
Development must be included in each evaluation per corporate requirements. Second, the se-
lected performance category weights must sum to 100. Third, all subitems within a category
must be scored on a 0&ndash;5 scale, which are added together and divided by the number of sub-
items for an average category score. This average score is then multiplied by the category
weight to yield the total score for that category. When all selected categories are scored, the
category totals are added to arrive at a performance level ranging from 0 to 500 points,
resulting in one of the following designations:S

</p>
<p>336 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A detailed user&rsquo;s manual provides guidance for subitem scoring. For example, the first perfor-
mance category listed in Exhibit 9.10 is on-time delivery performance. The score is based on
the number of deliveries that arrived on time divided by the total number of deliveries. The fol-
lowing scale determines the delivery performance score:
</p>
<p>Buyers or supply chain specialists must communicate with internal customers to get addi-
tional insight into each supplier&rsquo;s performance history. Ideally, feedback from internal cus-
tomers is incorporated into the scorecard so results can be shared with suppliers on a
regular basis. Because most supplier scorecards include some qualitative assessments or
judgments, suppliers may question or even disagree with parts of their score. This is not a
major drawback to the system. In fact, disagreements can be positive because they open
channels of communication between FedEx and its suppliers.
</p>
<p>Users now have the ability to weight the subitems within a category rather than providing a
single weight for the entire category. FedEx also expects to expand scorecard use to include
a greater number of suppliers. Supply chain managers at FedEx realize that something as im-
portant as supplier management requires a rigorous measurement system that supports the
attainment of supply objectives.

<p>CONCLUSION
Effectively managing and improving supplier performance is a primary supply
</p>
<p>management and business function. Supplier management and development consti-
tute the new model of supply management. No longer does a buyer simply purchase
parts from the lowest-priced source. The activities that best describe today&rsquo;s enlight-
ened buyer include planning, coordinating, managing, developing, and improving per-
formance capabilities throughout the supply base. For many items, buyers no longer
just buy parts from suppliers; they manage supplier relationships and capabilities.
</p>
<p>Therefore, supply management must carefully select and manage a proper mix of
suppliers. To accomplish this, the buying organization must invest the requisite re-
sources for effective supplier management, including a broad-based supplier perfor-
mance measurement system, contracts with preferred or certified suppliers, and a
wide range of supplier development tools and techniques. An effective supplier man-
agement program helps maximize the contribution received from suppliers, lowering
costs, increasing quality, and developing future capabilities.

<p>Worldwide Sourcing at Selex
</p>
<p>Selex, a U.S.-based electronics company with $2 billion in annual sales, is a company
in transition. The early 1990s, which began the longest period of industrial expansion in U.S.
history, were not rewarding for the company. Selex experienced eroding profit margins due to
intense global competition and mature product lines (with some of its products being 20 to
25 years old), making it vulnerable to cost-reduction pressure and lower profit margins.
</p>
<p>The company suffered through several costly product failures during the 1990s and lost mar-
ket share as new competitors and technologies encroached on core markets. And, with some
difficulty, the company was forced to change its culture to respond to the demands of a new
marketplace. Selex has had to change from being a technology-driven company to a flexible,
market-focused company.
</p>
<p>Selex organizes supply management into three distinct groups: indirect purchasing, raw mate-
rials purchasing (any material that is required for production), and contract or finished
goods purchasing (outsourced finished goods). Each group has pursued innovative ap-
proaches to worldwide sourcing.
</p>
<p>INDIRECT PURCHASING
Previous efforts at managing indirect purchases were U.S. focused, even though Selex has a
manufacturing presence in the United Kingdom, Mexico, the United States, Japan, and China.
A major corporate initiative at Selex has involved the development of a global sourcing pro-
cess called Sourcing Vision. Using this process, project teams systematically review Selex&rsquo;s
worldwide indirect spend with the goal of achieving cost savings of 7 to 15% annually.
</p>
<p>An executive steering committee oversees the Sourcing Vision process. This committee con-
sists of the vice president of research, the vice president of supply chain management, the
vice president of marketing and sales, the vice president of information technology, and the
corporate controller. Each member resides at the executive vice president level, and each
champions a specific global project.
</p>
<p>Cross-functional project teams are an integral part of Sourcing Vision. Project teams engage
in the following activities:
</p>
<p>&bull; Analyzing the industry and identifying buyer and seller strengths and weaknesses
&bull; Defining improvement goals
&bull; Identifying potential suppliers
&bull; Forwarding and analyzing supplier proposals
&bull; Determining the criteria for supplier selection
&bull; Developing a sourcing strategy
&bull; Making supplier selection decisions
</p>
<p>RAW MATERIALS PURCHASING
The second major procurement group is raw materials purchasing (which most companies
call direct materials). As part of its global procurement strategy, the raw materials group
has focused on (1) identifying and qualifying sources worldwide and (2) aggregating vol-
umes with leveraged agreements. This group also has responsibility for finished goods plan-
ning (which includes aggregate product planning).
</p>
<p>A major change in raw materials procurement involved technical personnel, operations,
and procurement working together worldwide to refine component materials. This cross-
functional approach, which is coordinated at the corporate level, examines systems tradeoffs
to arrive at an expected lowest total component cost. A second major change emphasized a
commodity approach to global strategy development, with leadership roles assumed by per-

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Globalization is dramatically changing interactions among the world&rsquo;s economies
through increasing interdependencies. Included in several definitions of globalization are
the terms &ldquo;interdependence,&rdquo; &ldquo;connectivity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;integration of economies&rdquo; in social,
technical, and political spheres. This trend toward seamless boundaries is explored in
depth by Thomas Friedman in his best seller The World Is Flat.1 Information now cir-
cles the globe with such ease that 245,000 Indians housed in call centers are scheduling
airline flights, soliciting credit card customers, and answering questions about mortgages
and insurance policies.2 When asked to indicate what business drivers were likely to
have the most influence on their company&rsquo;s purchasing strategies in the next 10 years,
49% of 359 responding executives stated it would be globalization.3
</p>
<p>Globalization in developing economies such as China and India represents oppor-
tunities for cost savings on the buying side and new markets on the selling side. On
the selling side more affluent consumers are desiring higher-level brands. The well-
known French cosmetics firm L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al failed to make a profit competing in India&rsquo;s
low-priced shampoo market. However, when it shifted its focus and advertising to
the emerging middle class, with products selling for 3 to 20 times the price of those
of its rivals, profits followed. The 200-million-person Indian middle class desires
many foreign brands, from Tommy Hilfiger jeans to Absolut vodka.4
</p>
<p>On the supply side, the cost/price benefits associated with sourcing in developing
countries are a significant motivation for remaining competitive in an increasingly
</p>
<p>sonnel from different sites. Selex has also established lead buyers at sites for items that are
not part of the coordinated commodity approach. One individual at each plant is responsible
for a procurement area and becomes Selex&rsquo;s resident expert.
</p>
<p>CONTRACT PURCHASING
The global outsourcing of finished products at Selex is a result of the realization that vertical
integration could not support 20 to 40 new-product launches a year. Most Selex products use
self-contained electronic components, which the company refers to as media. The physical
housing of the product is the hardware. Selex insources media and outsources hardware be-
cause most of the innovation that customers value occurs within media rather than
hardware.
</p>
<p>Approximately seven years ago, Selex formed a contract manufacturing organization with pri-
mary responsibility for hardware outsourcing. This group now has responsibility for identifying
and qualifying outsource partners, assessing product quality, and working with contract manu-
facturers during new-product development. As part of the contract manufacturing organiza-
tion, the outsourcing director also has responsibility for two international purchasing offices
(IPOs). The IPOs identify potential contract manufacturers or identify available suppliers for a
specific application. The IPOs also support the indirect and raw materials purchasing groups
discussed earlier.
</p>
<p>Selex illustrates how a major corporation, faced with new competitive threats and declining
markets, transformed itself from a slow, functionally driven organization into a responsive,
market-driven, cross-functional enterprise. It also illustrates how three procurement groups,
each taking very different approaches, have endorsed worldwide sourcing as a way to help
achieve corporate objectives.

<p>global environment. Several studies have indicated that cost/price savings are the num-
ber one reason for global sourcing. Other important benefits realized are availability,
quality, and (to a lesser extent) innovation. Once a firm establishes sourcing roots in
these countries, it facilitates entry to marketing and selling opportunities. Many
larger multinationals take a more global perspective by seeking to supply their world-
wide operations with common sources of supply at the lowest worldwide cost, and
they are developing centralized and globally coordinated supply organizations to sup-
port these efforts.
</p>
<p>One indicator of this increased international sourcing is the large U.S. merchan-
dise trade deficit, which in 2006 was more than $700 billion. Much of the focus on
the increasing deficit is directed toward China. The U.S. government has stepped up
pressure on China to both open its markets and allow its currency to float freely.
This pressure is justified; looking at the top U.S. trading partners reveals that Canada
leads with China second, followed by Mexico, Japan, Germany, U.K., South Korea,
France, Taiwan, and Malaysia. As is shown in Exhibit 10.1, the first four partners ac-
count for 75% of total trade. Second, two of the four largest trading partners are part
of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Finally, because services such as call
centers are not captured by the data, India is not listed as a top 10 trading partner.
Outsourcing and offshoring of services are a large part of global sourcing strategies
for the 21st-century supply manager.
</p>
<p>Globalization is also changing the structure of many marketplaces as global compa-
nies extend their reach into all markets. Often the acquiring firm is not a U.S.-based
firm. In the aluminum industry, Rio Tinto of Australia acquired Canada&rsquo;s Alcan Alu-
minum. In obtaining Alcan, Rio Tinto bested U.S.-based Alcoa&rsquo;s bid.5 In the global
steel industry, Germany&rsquo;s Thyssen Krupp is building a $2.7 billion mill outside of Mo-
bile, AL. Scheduled for opening in 2010, the mill is the largest to be built in the
United States in over 40 years. Indian steel maker Essar Global announced plans to
build an integrated mill outside of Duluth, MN.6

<p>346 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This chapter focuses on how supply managers can capture the benefits of globaliza-
tion through international purchasing and global sourcing. International purchasing re-
lates to a commercial purchase transaction between a buyer and a supplier located in
different countries. This type of purchase is typically more complex than a domestic
purchase. Organizations must contend with lengthened lead times, increased rules
and regulations, currency fluctuations, customs requirements, and a host of other vari-
ables such as language and time differences.
</p>
<p>Global sourcing, which differs from international purchasing in scope and complex-
ity, involves proactively integrating and coordinating common items and materials,
processes, designs, technologies, and suppliers across worldwide purchasing, engineer-
ing, and operating locations. Because of the differences between international buying
and global sourcing, we will use the term worldwide sourcing for general discussions of
the process of purchasing from other countries.
</p>
<p>This chapter contains three major sections. The first section presents an overview
of worldwide sourcing, including the most common reasons why companies source
worldwide. The second section identifies the areas that make international purchas-
ing more complex than domestic sourcing. The final section presents those factors
that separate successful from less-successful global sourcing efforts.
</p>
<p>Worldwide Sourcing Overview
The number of U.S. companies that practice worldwide sourcing has increased dra-
</p>
<p>matically over the past three decades.7 Between 1973 and 1975, the percentage of com-
panies purchasing internationally more than doubled, from 21 to 45%. The oil
embargo of the 1970s, coupled with shortages of other basic materials, forced purchas-
ing to search overseas for suppliers. Many foreign producers were also becoming qual-
ity and cost leaders across a number of industries. The foreign items most sought
after by U.S. companies in 1975, for example, were production machinery and equip-
ment, followed by chemicals and mechanical and electrical components.
</p>
<p>The percentage of U.S. companies engaged in worldwide sourcing increased from
45 to 56% from 1975 to 1982. This increase reflected the continuing inability of do-
mestic suppliers and manufacturers to compete in terms of price, quality, and even de-
livery. Foreign suppliers could often provide higher-quality parts at a lower total cost.
For some, survival against foreign competitors required sourcing from the same sup-
pliers that supported the competition.
</p>
<p>The period from 1982 through 1987 saw a sharp rise in the number of companies
looking internationally for their purchase requirements&mdash;from 56 to 71%. During this
time the value of the U.S. dollar increased dramatically against other currencies. U.S.
imports became less expensive while U.S. firms found it difficult to export and com-
pete in world markets. The huge trade imbalances of the 1980s reflected the strength
of the U.S. dollar in world currency markets along with a continued lack of competi-
tiveness of many U.S. companies.
</p>
<p>Since 1987 the level of international purchasing and trade has accelerated rapidly.
The end of the Cold War led to the opening of trade with emerging markets in Rus-
sia, Eastern Europe, and China, which in turn has led to the development of new mar-
kets and new sources of supply. Furthermore, import and export restrictions are
lessening, partly as a function of the GATT agreement on free trade signed in

<p>Uruguay. The North American Free Trade Agreement, passed in 1993, has also re-
sulted in a dramatic increase in trade between the United States, Canada, and Mex-
ico. Trade talks between the United States and other countries, such as Japan and
China, also reduced trade restrictions.
</p>
<p>The average amount of total purchases from non-U.S. sources by larger firms has
increased from 9% of total purchases in 1993 to over 25% in 2000. One study indi-
cated that 38% of the firms surveyed forecasted they would source at least 60% of
their purchases on a global basis by 2010. This was up from 18% in 2000.8 The trend
toward increased international purchasing activity is clear. The growth in worldwide
sourcing is likely to continue rather than decrease. As indicated earlier, business driv-
ers most likely to have an influence on the company purchasing strategies in the
next 10 years are globalization and cost leadership.9 Besides lowest cost, there are
many possible reasons why firms will continue to purchase internationally.
</p>
<p>Why Source Worldwide?
Although the previous discussion provided some reasons for purchasing interna-
</p>
<p>tionally, let&rsquo;s discuss formally the more important reasons why companies pursue
worldwide sourcing.
</p>
<p>Cost/Price Benefits
After considering all the costs associated with international purchasing, savings of
</p>
<p>20 to 30% may be available. Cost differentials between countries arise because of
</p>
<p>&bull; Lower labor rates
</p>
<p>&bull; Different productivity levels
</p>
<p>&bull; Possible willingness to accept a lower profit margin

<p>Thinking Globally and
Buying Locally at Sony
</p>
<p>Countless organizations today face a similar scenario. They are expanding production fa-
cilities or distribution networks in a new country, and they must often develop local sources
of supply to meet domestic content regulations or to minimize transportation costs. At Sony,
its global procurement strategy has been to procure local parts whenever possible and to pro-
duce in those countries where the company&rsquo;s products are sold. In Europe, Sony sources ap-
proximately 90% of the company&rsquo;s product value locally; in Asia, Sony obtains 30 to 50% of
product content locally. When production shifts to a new area, local suppliers are developed
whenever possible. As a backup, Sony often negotiates with Japanese suppliers to ship parts
to the new production facilities. If no suitable local supplier exists, purchasing may negoti-
ate with a Japanese supplier to set up local production in the new country of operation. Al-
though Sony does not contribute capital to suppliers to set up production facilities, it will
help with training of personnel at new locations. Thus, Sony&rsquo;s policy is to produce as many
parts as possible locally at each location.

<p>&bull; Lower-cost inputs for materials
</p>
<p>&bull; Government subsidies
</p>
<p>Purchasing should consider only suppliers that are capable of meeting rigid qual-
ity and delivery standards, although far too often price differentials become the pri-
mary criterion behind a foreign sourcing decision. It is important to note that in
assessing the cost benefits of sourcing internationally, purchasers should include all
of the relevant costs associated with sourcing items beyond piece price, which a later
section discusses.
</p>
<p>Access to Product and Process Technology
The United States is no longer the undisputed product and process technology
</p>
<p>leader in the world. Other countries have developed leading-edge technologies in a
number of areas, such as electronic components. Purchasers that require these compo-
nents know that Asian suppliers are technology leaders. Gaining access to the most
current technology leaves many companies with little choice except to pursue world-
wide sourcing.
</p>
<p>Quality
Some countries, such as Japan and Germany, are obsessed with product quality.
</p>
<p>Producers in these countries have been able to capture an increasing share of world
markets across a range of industries. U.S. purchasers stuck with domestic suppliers
that produce poor quality often begin to source foreign components with the hope of
improving end-product quality. The combination of consistently high quality and
lower overall price has been a major contributor to the growth of U.S. companies buy-
ing internationally.
</p>
<p>Access to the Only Source Available
Economic recessions, mergers, and government environmental regulations often re-
</p>
<p>sult in suppliers exiting certain lines of business due to higher costs, loss of business
volume, or both. This capacity reduction makes it increasingly difficult for U.S. buy-
ers to source domestically. Although copper producers today are enjoying the bene-
fits of high prices and tight capacity, this was not always the case. During the early
and mid-1980s, U.S. copper producers closed many mines because of low copper
prices and inefficient process technology. Some copper buyers turned to overseas pro-
ducers to meet their requirements. A loss of supplier capability and availability in the
automotive, machine tool, and electronics industries often left domestic buyers with
no viable supply alternative except international sources.
</p>
<p>Introduce Competition to Domestic Suppliers
Companies that rely on competitive forces to maintain price and service levels
</p>
<p>within their industry sometimes use worldwide sourcing to introduce competition to
the domestic supply base. In industries characterized by limited domestic competi-
tion, this can diminish a supplier&rsquo;s power and break certain practices unfavorable to
purchasers. Selex, featured at the beginning of this chapter, historically sourced many
chemical products with a single large U.S. supplier. However, Selex is now qualifying
suppliers in emerging countries as a way to counteract the domestic supplier&rsquo;s

<p>pricing power. A more competitive supply market will shift power away from U.S.
suppliers as well as shift power from sellers to buyers.
</p>
<p>React to Buying Patterns of Competitors
This is probably the least-mentioned reason for worldwide sourcing, because most
</p>
<p>firms do not want to admit that they are reacting to the practices of competitors. Imi-
tating the action of competitors is the &ldquo;fashion and fear&rdquo; motive. A purchaser may
try to duplicate the factors that provide an advantage to a competitor, which may
mean sourcing from the same suppliers or regions of the world that a competitor
uses. There may be a belief that not sourcing in the same region(s) may create a com-
petitive disadvantage. This is especially true today with many firms believing they
must source in China or risk being at a cost disadvantage.
</p>
<p>Establish a Presence in a Foreign Market
Virtually the whole world is a potential market for goods and services from the
</p>
<p>United States, so it makes good economic and political sense to buy in those markets
when planning to sell there. One way to develop goodwill in the country to assist in
gaining product or service acceptance is through business relationships that will help
support an expanded marketing presence.
</p>
<p>In order to gain access to the lowest costs, cutting-edge technology, and best capa-
bilities, organizations must scan the global landscape in search of the best suppliers.
By aligning technology roadmaps with leading-edge suppliers, designers can ensure
that their products and services will truly be world class, not just the best in the re-
gion. Although the exact reasons each company sources internationally will vary, they
surely include some of those discussed here. Without access to worldwide sources of
supply, companies may not remain competitive. A domestic company that purchases
a portion of its material requirements worldwide is better than a domestic company
that is no longer in business as a result of its inability to meet global competition.
</p>
<p>Barriers to Worldwide Sourcing
Companies with little or no international experience often face obstacles or bar-
</p>
<p>riers when beginning worldwide sourcing. These barriers include (1) lack of knowl-
edge and skills concerning global sourcing; (2) resistance to change; (3) longer lead
times; (4) different business customs, language, and culture; and (5) currency fluc-
uations.
</p>
<p>The lack of knowledge and skills pertaining to the intricacies of global sourcing
inhibits a company from considering global sources. These shortcomings include a
basic lack of knowledge about potential sources of supply or a lack of familiarity with
the additional documentation required for international purchasing. International
documentation requirements include
</p>
<p>&bull; Letters of credit
</p>
<p>&bull; Multiple bills of lading
</p>
<p>&bull; Dock receipts
</p>
<p>&bull; Import licenses
</p>

<p>&bull; Certificates of insurance coverage
</p>
<p>&bull; Packing lists
</p>
<p>&bull; Commercial invoices
</p>
<p>Resistance to change from an established, routine procedure or shifting from a
long-standing supplier are also major barriers. It is natural to resist changes that repre-
sent a radical departure from existing ways of doing business. Domestic market na-
tionalism has also sometimes presented itself as a barrier. Buyers are sometimes
reluctant to shift business from domestic sources to unknown foreign sources. Home
market nationalism, although not the obstacle it was years ago, can still be an issue.
</p>
<p>Another barrier involves managing longer lead times and extended material pipe-
lines. With longer lead times, accurate materials forecasts over extended periods be-
come critical. Buyers must manage delivery dates closely because of the possibility of
transit or customs delays. International sourcing also introduces an additional degree
of logistical, political, and financial risk.
</p>
<p>Other barriers relate to a lack of knowledge about foreign business practices, lan-
guage, and culture. Negotiations with foreign suppliers can be more difficult, and sim-
ple engineering or delivery change requests can become frustrating experiences.
Meetings and negotiations with international suppliers require knowledge of the cus-
toms and culture associated with the particular country. Lack of understanding of cus-
toms can lead to serious problems in making significant progress in negotiations and
in building relationships with the supplier.
</p>
<p>Currency fluctuations can have a significant impact on the price paid for the item.
Major currencies fluctuate daily, and therefore it is important for the buyer to under-
stand the options to minimize this significant risk. Specific currency fluctuation strate-
gies are discussed later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The most common method for overcoming these barriers involves education and
training, which can generate support for the process as well as help overcome the anxi-
ety associated with change. Publicizing success stories can also show the performance
benefits that worldwide purchasing provides. Globally linked computer-aided design
systems, electronic mail, and bar code systems that help track material through inter-
national pipelines have helped reduce the communication barriers surrounding world-
wide sourcing. Some companies also insist on only working with those foreign
suppliers that have U.S.-based support personnel.
</p>
<p>Measurement and reward systems can encourage sourcing from the best suppliers
worldwide. These firms measure and reward buyers on the basis of their ability to real-
ize performance benefits from the selected use of international sources. The use of
third-party or external agents can also help overcome barriers to international pur-
chasing, particularly when first starting out. The use of brokers can be an efficient
way to get your feet wet in worldwide sourcing.
</p>
<p>Regardless of the technique used to overcome worldwide sourcing barriers, the ef-
fort will fail unless top management demonstrates its support for worldwide sourc-
ing. Management must send the message that going international is a means to
remain competitive by using the most competitive suppliers and does not represent
an effort to force domestic suppliers out of business.

<p>Sourcing
Snapshot
</p>
<p>The Balancing Act: Low
Price versus Safety in
Chinese Sourcing
</p>
<p>Recent events in the food and toy industries have shown that although cost and price
advantages are major factors driving global sourcing, they need to be balanced against the
total cost. Mattel recalled more than 1 million lead-contaminated toys that were made in
China. The recall involved 83 types of toys from the firm&rsquo;s Fisher-Price unit. The toys con-
tained excessive levels of lead paint despite lead-paint regulations in both China and the
United States. Experts estimate that 80% of the toys imported into the United States come
from China, so the lead-paint problem is extensive. Supply managers have contract provi-
sions limiting lead paint; however, enforcement is a problem. Using lead additives in paint
is inexpensive and allows paint to dry more quickly; it also prevents corrosion of painted
parts. These advantages help suppliers meet relentless cost pressures from customers.
</p>
<p>Mattel had a 15-year trusted relationship with the supplier, so it allowed the supplier to do
the product testing. Mattel&rsquo;s periodic quality audits also didn&rsquo;t catch the problem. Lack of
proper testing has heightened the call for independent third-party testing. Tragically, weeks
after the Mattel recall, Cheung Shu-Hung, the owner of the Chinese toy factory, reportedly
committed suicide. A combination of pressure from the customer to ensure that such events
would not happen again and the loss of face in government-business circles created a huge
sense of shame for the owner. Mattel now must deal with the cost of recalled toys and multi-
ple lawsuits from parents of children exposed to the lead paint. One of the classes of these
suits involves medical monitoring, which allows families to sue toy makers and others before
their children show any kind of injury. Should these types of lawsuits be allowed, a signifi-
cant amount of Mattel&rsquo;s resources would be tied up for the immediate future.
</p>
<p>Another toy company, Toys &ldquo;R&rdquo; Us, voluntarily recalled 128,700 military toys sold under the
Elite Operations brand. According to the company the toys originally passed two tests, the
first before they were put into production and the second after first shipment. Subsequent peri-
odic tests conducted by a third party discovered the lead. As a result of the recall, the firm
set up a cross-functional team that meets monthly to discuss safety issues.
</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s Corporation, another of the world&rsquo;s largest toy buyers, has found the Chinese
lead-paint problem to be so pervasive that it has started managing deep into the supply
chain. The firm monitors its Chinese toy manufacturers&rsquo; paint sources back to the paint manu-
facturers. It requires its Chinese toy makers to use only these approved sources.
</p>
<p>Supply managers must take a proactive and hands-on approach to any potential safety risks
and factor the costs into the sourcing process. Wal-Mart Corporation worked with its shrimp
supplier Rubicon, LLC, to upgrade its 150 Thai shrimp farms. By the end of 2007 these
farms must meet a set of environmental and social standards backed by Wal-Mart, Darden
Restaurants, and other large shrimp buyers. Wal-Mart is the largest U.S. buyer of shrimp, im-
porting 20,000 tons annually or 3.4% of U.S. total shrimp imports. The Global Aquaculture Al-
liance will develop similar standards for farming of tilapia, catfish, and salmon. The
problem is that many small family-run operations don&rsquo;t have the resources to make the in-
vestments or lack the power to recover their investments with higher prices. These small pro-
ducers feel the procedures merely replicate their country standards and result in higher
costs. The net impact may be a consolidation of Wal-Mart&rsquo;s supply base to fewer, stronger
suppliers that exert control over the entire shrimp-farming supply chain.S

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Progressing from Domestic Buying to International
Purchasing
</p>
<p>An organization progresses (usually reactively) from domestic buying to interna-
tional purchasing because it confronts a situation for which no suitable domestic sup-
plier exists, or because competitors are gaining an advantage due to international
purchasing. First-level firms may also find themselves driven toward international pur-
chasing because of triggering events in the supply market. Such events could be a sup-
ply disruption, rapidly changing currency exchange rates, a declining domestic
supply base, inflation within the home market, or the sudden emergence of world-
wide competitors. Whatever the reason, many issues now become part of the interna-
tional purchasing process that were not part of the domestic sourcing decision, or are
now even more important than when sourcing was done domestically.
</p>
<p>Information about Worldwide Sources
After identifying items to purchase internationally, a firm must gather and evalu-
</p>
<p>ate information on potential suppliers or identify intermediaries capable of that task.
This can prove challenging if a company is inexperienced or has limited outside con-
tacts or sources of information. The following resources can provide valuable leads
when identifying potential suppliers or trade intermediaries.
</p>
<p>International Industrial Directories
Industrial directories, which are increasingly available through the Internet, are a
</p>
<p>major source of information about suppliers by industry or region of the world. Hun-
dreds of directories are available that identify potential international contacts. Here
are some examples:
</p>
<p>&bull; The World Marketing Directory covers 50,000 major businesses in all lines
having high sales volume and at least an interest in foreign trade; it is pub-
lished by Dun &amp; Bradstreet. Entries include the company&rsquo;s line of business
and industry code.
</p>
<p>&bull; Marconi&rsquo;s International Register details 45,000 firms worldwide conducting
business internationally; it lists products geographically under 3,500 product
headings.
</p>
<p>&bull; ABC Europe Production covers 130,000 European manufacturers that export
their products.
</p>
<p>&bull; Business Directory of Hong Kong details Hong Kong firms, including manu-
facturers; importers; exporters; banks; and construction, transportation, and
service companies.

<p>These directories, and many more, are usually available on CD-ROM or accessible
through the Internet.
</p>
<p>Trade Shows
Trade shows are often one of the best ways to gather information on many suppli-
</p>
<p>ers at one time. These industrial shows occur throughout the world for practically ev-
ery industry. Most business libraries have a directory that lists worldwide trade
shows. Internet searches will also reveal the time and place of industrial trade shows,
including how to register. Examples include the International Manufacturing Technol-
ogy Show; manufacturing industry professionals from the United States and 119 coun-
tries attend this show held every two years. It is estimated that over 90,000 buyers
and sellers combine with over 1,200 exhibitors to meet and display the latest
manufacturing technology. With a minimal amount of research, purchasers can iden-
tify trade shows related directly to their purchasing needs.
</p>
<p>Trading Companies
Trading companies offer a full range of services to assist purchasers. These compa-
</p>
<p>nies will issue letters of credit and pay brokers, customs charges, dock fees, insur-
ance, and ocean carrier and inland freight bills. Clients usually receive one itemized
invoice for the total services performed. One U.S.-based trading company offers
more than 20 services, including
</p>
<p>&bull; Finding qualified sources
</p>
<p>&bull; Performing product quality audits
</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluating suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiating contracts
</p>
<p>&bull; Managing logistics
</p>
<p>&bull; Inspecting shipments
</p>
<p>&bull; Expediting
</p>
<p>&bull; Performing duty classifications
</p>
<p>The use of a full-service trading company may actually result in a lower total cost for
international purchases compared with performing each activity individually. Coun-
tries such as Japan and South Korea have trading companies located in major U.S. cit-
ies. KOTRA, a Korean-based trading company, is committed to promoting mutual
prosperity between Korea and its trading partners through international commerce
and investment (www.kotradallas.com). Foreign trading companies offer one-stop
shopping for buyers interested in the goods and services of a particular country.
They will locate the sources, quote the prices, insure quality, and handle all the ex-
port and import documentation.
</p>
<p>Third-Party Support
Experts are available to provide international sourcing assistance. Independent
</p>
<p>agents, working on commission, will act as purchasing representatives in a foreign
country. They locate sources of supply, evaluate the source, and handle the required
paperwork and documentation. Some agents also provide or can arrange for full-
service capability.

<p>354 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="www.kotradallas.com">www.kotradallas.com</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Agents and brokers are an option when a company lacks foreign expertise or a pres-
ence in a foreign market. They help locate foreign suppliers and act as intermediaries
between the buyer and seller. Direct manufacturer&rsquo;s representatives or sales rep-
resentatives can also be a source of valuable information. Such individuals work di-
rectly for sellers as their representatives in a country. Finally, different state and
federal agencies encourage and promote international trade. Services provided by
these agencies are usually reasonable in cost.
</p>
<p>Trade Consulates
Purchasers can contact foreign trade consulates located in major cities across the
</p>
<p>United States for information. Almost all consulates have trade experts who are eager
to do business with American buyers. Purchasers can also contact U.S. embassies lo-
cated overseas to inquire about suppliers located in a particular country. The U.S. De-
partment of Commerce also has offices staffed by trade specialists that offer several
good services at a nominal fee.
</p>
<p>The amount and type of information required is partly a function of how a pur-
chaser chooses to handle the foreign purchase. Purchasers that use intermediaries,
such as trading companies and external agents, must search for information that iden-
tifies the best intermediaries. Purchasers that control the buying process must obtain
information about suppliers from trade directories, trade shows, embassies, supplier
representatives, and other sources of international information.
</p>
<p>Supplier Selection Issues
Whether the purchaser or an external agent coordinates the international pur-
</p>
<p>chase, foreign suppliers must be subject to the same, or in some cases more rigorous,
performance evaluation and standards as domestic suppliers. Never assume a foreign
company can automatically satisfy a buyer&rsquo;s performance requirements or expecta-
tions. Here are some questions to ask when evaluating foreign sources:
</p>
<p>&bull; Does a significant total cost difference exist between the domestic and the
foreign source after factoring in additional cost elements?
</p>
<p>&bull; Will the foreign supplier maintain any price differences over time?
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the effect of longer material pipelines and increased average inven-
tory levels?
</p>
<p>&bull; What are the supplier&rsquo;s technical and quality capabilities?
</p>
<p>&bull; Can the supplier assist with new designs?
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the supplier&rsquo;s quality performance? What types of quality systems
does it have in place?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the supplier capable of consistent delivery schedules?
</p>
<p>&bull; How much lead time does the supplier require?
</p>
<p>&bull; Can we develop a longer-term relationship with this supplier?
</p>
<p>&bull; Are patents and proprietary technology safe with this supplier? Is the sup-
plier trustworthy? What legal system does the supplier expect to follow?
</p>
<p>&bull; What are the supplier&rsquo;s payment terms?
</p>
<p>&bull; How does the supplier manage currency exchange issues?
</p>
<p>At times buyers use trial orders to evaluate foreign sources. Purchasers may ini-
tially not be willing to rely on a foreign source for an entire purchase requirement. A

<p>buyer can use smaller or trial orders to begin to establish a supplier&rsquo;s performance
record.
</p>
<p>Cultural Understanding
Perhaps one of the biggest barriers to international sourcing involves the cultural
</p>
<p>differences that arise when doing business with other countries. Culture is the sum of
the understandings that govern human interaction in a society. Culture is a multidi-
mensional concept composed of several elements, including: (1) language, (2) reli-
gion, (3) values and attitudes, (4) customs, (5) social institutions, and (6) education.
Two very important differences in culture that can affect the supply manager are
values and behavior. Values are shared beliefs or group norms that are internalized;
they affect the way people think. Behavior is based on values and attitudes; it affects
the way people act. Understanding cultural differences will improve a purchaser&rsquo;s
comfort and effectiveness when conducting business internationally. A major com-
plaint about Americans is our ignorance of other cultures.
</p>
<p>Cultural differences between countries can result in some unwelcome surprises
when buying internationally. For instance, the standard procedures for negotiation
and contracting are distinctly different in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Deal-
ing with these issues requires purchasing personnel and organizations to manage dif-
ferent beliefs about contracting. Beliefs in developing countries about ethical issues,
such as bribery, differ widely from U.S. practices. What is an illegal activity in the
United States (providing bribes) is often an accepted business practice in many
regions.
</p>
<p>Language and Communication Differences
A major part of the supply manager&rsquo;s role is communicating requirements clearly
</p>
<p>and effectively to suppliers. Language differences can sometimes interfere with the ef-
fective communication of requirements. Not everyone understands English, and
Americans will likely not understand the seller&rsquo;s native language.
</p>
<p>The largest differences in communication styles across countries are message
speed and level of content. Americans tend to give fast messages with the conclu-
sions expressed first. This style is not appropriate in many countries, particularly in
Europe.10
</p>
<p>Dick Locke, a procurement manager who has handled buying operations in To-
kyo, Europe, Mexico, and the Middle East, offers this advice about language and
communication:11
</p>
<p>&bull; If a supplier is using English as a second language, the buyer should be re-
sponsible for preventing communication problems.
</p>
<p>&bull; To aid in communication, speak slowly, use more communication graphics,
and eliminate jargon, slang, and sports and military metaphors from your
language.
</p>
<p>&bull; Bring an interpreter to all but the most informal meetings. Allow an extra
day to educate interpreters on your issues and vocabulary.
</p>
<p>&bull; Document, in writing, the conclusions and decisions made in a meeting be-
fore adjourning.S

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Logistical Issues
Buyers should not underestimate the potential effects of extended pipelines on
</p>
<p>their ability to plan and manage a worldwide supply chain. Although advanced indus-
trial countries have a developed infrastructure, many foreign countries do not, mak-
ing shipping delays a real possibility. China, for example, has 25 kilometers of paved
roads, 6.5 kilometers of railways, and 17 kilometers of runways per 1,000 square kilo-
meters of land. In comparison, the United States has 612 kilometers of paved roads,
22.7 kilometers of railways, and 189 kilometers of runways per 1,000 square kilo-
meters.12
</p>
<p>Fewer railroads, paved roads, and airports often leads to higher logistics costs and
less reliable deliveries. In the United States, the ratio of logistics costs to total gross do-
mestic product is about 10%. In developing countries, this ratio can be as high as
25% of total gross domestic product.13 This becomes a factor when calculating the to-
tal landed cost for foreign goods. One study estimated that it takes as much as 50%
more to transport goods in China than in the United States or Europe. The density
of land transportation is 22% of that in the United States and 5% of that in Japan,
and many roads are unpaved or in poor condition, slowing down transit times. This
is further complicated by China&rsquo;s lack of a cross-country carrier and the small size of
the average Chinese trucker&rsquo;s fleet (two vehicles). Additional regulations between differ-
ent provinces require frequent changes of trucks when crossing province boundaries.14
</p>
<p>All international shipments move by a standard set of terms. Incoterms are interna-
tionally recognized standard definitions that describe the responsibilities of a buyer
and seller in a commercial transaction. They are used in conjunction with a sales
agreement or other method of transacting the sale. The buyer and seller have an ar-
ray of terms from which to choose, depending on the extent to which each party
wants to be involved with the transportation and insurance. One of the complica-
tions is the modes by which an international shipment will move. Typically there will
be more than one mode of transportation involved.
</p>
<p>Modes of Transportation
EXW, CPT, CIP, DAF, DDU, and DDP are commonly used for any mode of trans-
</p>
<p>portation. FAS, FOB, CFR, CIF, DES, and DEQ are used for sea and inland water-
way. Exhibit 10.2 on p. 358 highlights the 13 standard Incoterms.
</p>
<p>Legal Issues
Legal systems differ from country to country. The United States uses common or
</p>
<p>case law, which often results in longer and more detailed contracts compared with
countries that use code or civil law. Before IBM redesigned its purchasing process in
the late 1990s, it was common for purchase contracts to be more than 40 pages in
length. A redesign effort reduced this to around six pages. Many foreign countries do
not like to deal with the U.S. legal system and long contracts.
</p>
<p>Advanced industrial countries have legal systems that provide the buyer protec-
tion and fair treatment. This may not be true in developing countries. Many coun-
tries offer no effective protection against the piracy of intellectual property. It is
necessary, therefore, to perform a thorough check of prospective suppliers before re-
leasing designs or other proprietary information.

<p>Managing Risk: The Hid-
den Costs of Sourcing in
China
</p>
<p>The race by firms in the United States and other countries to source goods and ser-
vices in China shows no indication of slowing down. Through experience many firms are also
learning that the cost savings they initially projected may be reduced by hidden costs. Data
from a study of more than 150 executives with general management (including supply chain
and operations) highlights some important lessons to consider before jumping into China.
Three out of four (75%) of these executives were already outsourcing at least one function in
China. The most cited outsourced function was manufacturing, but respondents were out-
sourcing other functions such as research and development or IT support.
</p>
<p>Some of the management issues these executives say are important to keep in mind are cul-
tural and extend into Chinese business practices. Cultural norms are different from those in
the United States, and therefore it is important to study Chinese culture and norms before en-
tering any serious negotiations. Not doing this is a recipe for failure or much higher costs.
For example, it is important to determine the nature of the relationship that will be devel-
oped. This could range from a simple agreement for standard items to a very involved partner-
ship for a critical item. Relationships are often coupled with reciprocal obligations. For
example, after one U.S. firm reached agreement on one item with a Chinese supplier, they
were questioned and cajoled into agreeing that future items would be awarded to them or a
supplier that they recommended.
</p>
<p>If the firm is outsourcing operations (manufacturing) to China, the current process should be
stable and operating at a competitive level. It is not a good idea to outsource a problem pro-
cess, because China is a developing country and currently has a shortage of high-skilled
workers as well as management expertise. Thus there will be some training required on the
part of the outsourcer. Outsourcing a stable process will allow the outsourcer to train and
measure the Chinese supplier. Most of the respondents in the survey indicated that the transi-
tion involves a commitment of both people and time. Most estimated it would take twice as
long as originally estimated to reach a steady state of production. One key to reducing the
time to steady state is to look at implementation frameworks from other firms that have had
successful experiences in China.
</p>
<p>Regarding specific outsourcing issues, don&rsquo;t be penny wise and pound foolish. This means visit-
ing the site where the product is to be made. Verify the skill, quality, and turnover rate of the
employees. Indications from this sample are that hidden costs can add 15&ndash;24% to the unit
price when sourcing in China. These hidden costs include higher shipping costs (10&ndash;15%),
warranty costs (4&ndash;7%), and travel/coordination costs (1&ndash;3%). By one estimate, 10,000 contain-
ers from China annually fall overboard. Additionally, intellectual property laws are not consis-
tently enforced and discussions must address how intellectual property will be protected.
Finally, labor rates vary widely and are increasing due to demand for Chinese goods.
</p>
<p>In summary, any entry into China needs to be made with a clear strategy that includes a bud-
get for travel, an understanding of the culture, calculation of the expected hidden costs, and
site visits to clearly communicate expectations and process improvement plans. Extending a
supply chain by 7,000 miles clearly has its challenges, and managers are now beginning to
realize this and adjust savings to include these hidden costs.

<p>International contracts can be used if the country the buyer is doing business with
follows the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
(CISG). The CISG took effect on January 1, 1988. The purpose was to facilitate interna-
tional trade by removing legal barriers. Unless the parties have specified to the con-
trary, the CISG applies to sales of goods contracts between parties with places of
business in the &ldquo;Contracting States.&rdquo; Contracting States are those countries that have
ratified the CISG.
</p>
<p>Countries that are part of the World Trade Organization are expected to follow cer-
tain international trade practices and protect intellectual property. Buyers and sellers
doing business across boundaries should agree, preferably in a contract, about what
laws will cover the business transaction.
</p>
<p>U.S. buyers employed by domestic or foreign-based firms must also be mindful of
their conduct in dealings with foreign government officials. The Foreign Corrupt Prac-
tices Act (FCPA) was passed by Congress in 1977 to prevent companies from mak-
ing questionable or illegal payments to foreign government officials, politicians, and
political parties. The law prohibits U.S. citizens or their agents from making pay-
ments to foreign officials to secure or retain business, and it requires accurate record
keeping and adequate controls for company transactions. Since 1998, these practices
apply to foreign firms and persons who make such corrupt payments while in the
United States. There is no dollar threshold on the act, making it illegal to offer even
a dollar as a bribe. Enforcement focuses on the intent of the bribery more than the
amount.
</p>
<p>In 2004 Lucent Technologies fired four top executives from its China operations
for making bribes. The deficiencies in China were uncovered during the company&rsquo;s
FCPA compliance audits stemming from an investigation into its practices in Saudi
Arabia.15

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Organizational Issues
Chapter 5 provides a broad discussion of organizational issues. A logical approach
</p>
<p>when trying to meet a company&rsquo;s growing worldwide sourcing requirements has
been the establishment of international purchasing offices (IPOs) in selected areas
around the world. Foreign nationals, who usually report directly to a centralized cor-
porate procurement office, staff the IPO. IPOs can support the sourcing needs of the
entire organization, not just a single division or buying unit. Larger firms are more
likely than smaller ones to have international purchasing offices. IPOs have several
major functions, which Exhibit 10.3 identifies.
</p>
<p>A 2006 study on global sourcing indicated that the growth in IPOs over the past
five years corresponded to an increase in higher-level global sourcing. Firms were
using their IPOs to provide operational support from the development phase through
contract management of the global agreement. Specific IPO activities included facili-
tating import and export requirements, resolving quality and delivery performance
problems, and measuring supplier performance.16
</p>
<p>Another organizational issue is how to structure the overall global sourcing ef-
forts. Recent research stated that maintaining central control and leadership over the
strategic elements of a global sourcing program enhances the probability of achieving

<p>improved sourcing process outcomes.17 This can occur even though firms may also
decentralize operational activities. Exhibit 10.4 on p. 361 presents a structure that con-
tains elements of centralized and decentralized decision making. Decentralized pur-
chasing at the divisional or business unit level supports domestic sourcing, whereas a
centralized international purchasing office supports the international requirements of
the different business units.
</p>
<p>Countertrade Requirements
A specialized form of international trade that has increased over the last 25 years
</p>
<p>is countertrade. This broad term refers to all international and domestic trade where
buyer and seller have at least a partial exchange of goods for goods. This exchange
can involve a complete trade of goods for goods or involve some partial payment to
a firm in cash.
</p>
<p>Although many companies have established a countertrade office or department,
purchasing is sometimes involved in negotiating and managing countertrade agree-
ments, including determining the market or sales value of countertrade deals or select-
ing appropriate products to fulfill countertrade requirements.
</p>
<p>A country imposes countertrade demands for a number of reasons. First, some
countries simply lack the hard currency to purchase imported goods. Developing na-
tions often require Western multinationals to accept goods as at least partial payment
for sales within their country. Another reason for countertrade requirements is that
countertrade provides a means of selling products in markets to which a company
may have otherwise lacked access. A country wishing to sell its products or services
in global markets may rely upon the marketing expertise of multinational companies
to market or arrange for marketing of the country&rsquo;s products through intermediaries.
</p>
<p>Countertrade demands often arise when several factors are present. Items involv-
ing large dollar amounts, such as military contracts, are prime candidates for counter-
trade. Companies can also expect countertrade demands from a country when that
country&rsquo;s goods have a low or nondifferentiated perception in the world marketplace.
This may include items that are available from many sources, commodity-type items,
or items not perceived as technologically superior or having higher quality compared
with other available products. Highly valued items or those sought after by the buy-
ing country are less susceptible to countertrade demands.
</p>
<p>Types of Countertrade
As firms have strived to meet countertrade requirements, several different forms
</p>
<p>have evolved. The five predominant types of countertrade arrangements are (1) bar-
ter, (2) counterpurchase, (3) offset, (4) buy-back, and (5) switch trading.
</p>
<p>Barter
The oldest and most basic form of trading is barter, a process that involves the
</p>
<p>straight exchange of goods for goods with no exchange of currency. It requires trad-
ing parties to enter into a single contract to fulfill trading requirements. Despite its ap-
parent simplicity, barter is one of the least-practiced forms of countertrade today.
</p>
<p>Barter differs from other forms of countertrade in several ways. Barter involves no
exchange of money between parties. Next, a single contract formalizes a barter trans-
action whereas other forms of countertrade require two or more contracts. Finally,

<p>362 Part 3 Strategic Sourcing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>barter arrangements usually relate to a specific transaction and cover a period of time
shorter than that covered by other arrangements.
</p>
<p>Counterpurchase
Counterpurchase requires a selling firm to purchase a specified amount of goods
</p>
<p>from the country that purchased its products. The amount to counterpurchase is a
percentage of the amount of the original sale. This requirement usually ranges from
5 to 80% of the total value of the transaction but can actually exceed 100% under
some circumstances.
</p>
<p>This form of countertrade requires a company to fulfill its countertrade require-
ment by purchasing products within a country unrelated to its primary business. The
countertrading company identifies a list of possible purchase items that will fulfill the
countertrade requirement. The purchaser must market the unrelated goods or use a
third party to assume those duties, which introduces increased complexity and cost
into the transaction.
</p>
<p>Offset
Offset agreements, which are closely related to counterpurchase, also require the
</p>
<p>seller to purchase some agreed-upon percentage of goods from a country over a speci-
fied period. However, offset agreements allow a company to fulfill its countertrade re-
quirement with any company or industry in the country. The selling firm can
purchase items related directly to its business requirements, which offers the pur-
chaser greater flexibility. An example of an offset purchase is a U.S. aircraft manufac-
turer that obtains a contract to sell planes in Spain and agrees to purchase products
worth 100% of the contract value in Spain.
</p>
<p>Buy-Back
Some countertrade authorities also refer to this type of countertrade as compensa-
</p>
<p>tion trading. Buy-back occurs when a firm physically builds a plant in another country
or provides a service, equipment, or technology to support the plant. The firm then
agrees to take a portion of the plant&rsquo;s output as payment. Countries lacking foreign ex-
change for payment but rich in natural resources can benefit from this type of coun-
tertrade arrangement. Opportunities exist for Western companies to provide the
plant, equipment, and expertise to bring resources to market.
</p>
<p>Switch Trading
This form of countertrade involves the use of a third-party trader to sell earned
</p>
<p>counterpurchase credits. Switch trading occurs when a selling company agrees to ac-
cept goods from the buying country as partial payment. If the selling company does
not want the goods from the country, it can sell, at a discount, the credits for these
goods to a third-party trader, which sells or markets the goods. The trader charges a
fee for handling the transaction. The original selling company must consider the dis-
count and third-party fee when evaluating the total cost of a countertrade arrange-
ment with a country.
</p>
<p>Purchasing&rsquo;s role in countertrade will not be as visible as marketing&rsquo;s role. Purchas-
ing is usually a reactive participant that must identify supply sources that will help sat-
isfy any countertrade requirements that a company has incurred through the sale of
its product.

<p>Costs Associated with International Purchasing
Purchasers must examine the additional costs associated with international pur-
</p>
<p>chasing. Whether the purchase transaction is with a domestic or foreign producer,
there are certain common costs. The difference between domestic and foreign pur-
chasing, however, is that foreign purchasing must include the additional costs associ-
ated with conducting overseas transactions. If price is a major factor, then a buyer
must compare the total cost of the foreign purchase to the total cost of the domestic
purchase. Exhibit 10.5 summarizes the various charges often associated with interna-
tional purchasing and logistics.
</p>
<p>Common Costs
Certain costs are common between domestic and foreign purchasing. These in-
</p>
<p>clude the unit purchase price quoted by a supplier, tooling charges, and transporta-
tion from the supplier (common cost does not mean the costs are equal). Unit price
evaluation must consider the effect of quantity discounts, minimum buys necessary
</p>
<p>Exhibit 10.5 Elements of Total Cost for Worldwide Sourcing
</p>
<p>Base Price
</p>
<p>&bull; Ascertain quantity breaks, minimum buys for shipping efficiency, and any surcharges.
&bull; Determine price for rush shipments of smaller-than-planned quantities, which are often more.
</p>
<p>Tooling
</p>
<p>&bull; Ideally, the purchaser should own the tooling and pay for it only once.
&bull; Consider shipping tooling from a domestic source if transferable.
</p>
<p>Packaging
</p>
<p>&bull; This is a hidden cost (may be expensive for long distances and multiple handlings).
&bull; Consult a packaging supplier or internal engineer for methods to minimize cost on international
</p>
<p>shipments.
</p>
<p>Escalation
</p>
<p>&bull; Determine for how long the quoted price is firm.
&bull; Determine components of escalation (i.e., ensure that price increases are not hidden in other
</p>
<p>costs).
</p>
<p>Transportation
</p>
<p>&bull; Obtain assistance from logistics personnel who have expertise in international transportation.
&bull; Consider consolidation of shipments with other corporations from the same geographical area.
&bull; Use multinational carriers or freight brokers to manage shipments and cost where required.
&bull; Consult the foreign supplier as a source of information regarding freight sources.
</p>
<p>Customs Duty
</p>
<p>&bull; Duties paid any time a shipment crosses international lines&mdash;can vary widely over range of
goods, and often change on short notice.
</p>
<p>&bull; Provided by U.S. Published Tariff Schedules.
&bull; Items may fall into more than one classification.
&bull; May be best to discuss this with a customs agent/broker.
</p>
<p>Insurance Premiums
</p>
<p>&bull; Not typically included in an ocean shipment price (need marine insurance).
&bull; Don&rsquo;t pay for extra coverage that your company may already carry for international transactions.

<p>for shipping efficiency, the effect on price due to expedited shipments, and any sup-
plier-specified surcharges or extras.
</p>
<p>Transportation costs also require critical evaluation. For example, what is the ef-
fect on transportation costs if the purchaser controls a shipment directly from the sup-
plier instead of having the supplier arrange shipment? What is the effect on
transportation costs due to longer distances? International transportation often re-
quires assistance from personnel with special expertise. A transportation group can re-
view carrier quotations, evaluate shipping alternatives, and recommend the most
efficient course of action, which may include combining international shipments with
those of other purchasers to obtain favorable freight rates.
</p>
<p>International Transaction Costs
International purchasing creates additional costs that are not part of domestic pur-
</p>
<p>chasing. Failure to include these costs in a total cost analysis can lead to a miscalcula-
tion of the total cost of the purchase.
</p>
<p>For a first-time purchase, the seller may request a letter of credit. Letters of credit
are issued by the purchaser&rsquo;s bank in conjunction with an affiliate bank in the seller&rsquo;s
country. It assures the seller that the funds are in the bank. The supplier can draw

</p>
<p>Payment Terms
</p>
<p>&bull; Foreign suppliers often grant longer payment terms such as net 60.
&bull; If dealing with intermediaries, the payment may be requested upon shipment.
</p>
<p>Additional Fees and Commissions
</p>
<p>&bull; Ask supplier, customs broker, and transportation personnel if other costs may be incurred, and
who is responsible for these costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; If your shipment is held at the port of entry due to a lack of documentation and customs offi-
cials place it in storage, a storage fee will be billed to the customer. (Who will pay for this?)
</p>
<p>Port Terminal and Handling Fees
</p>
<p>&bull; U.S. port and handling charges (unloading cargo, administrative services of port personnel, and
use of port).
</p>
<p>Customs Broker Fees
</p>
<p>&bull; Flat charge per transaction.
</p>
<p>Taxes
</p>
<p>&bull; Consider any additional taxes that may be paid.

<p>Communication Costs
</p>
<p>&bull; Higher phone, travel, mailing, telex, fax, e-mail charges.
</p>
<p>Payment and Currency Fees
</p>
<p>&bull; Bank transfers, bills of exchange, hedging and forward contracts.
</p>
<p>Inventory Carrying Costs
</p>
<p>&bull; Higher levels of inventory will have to be held because of longer lead times.
&bull; Costs include the interest rate forgone by investing funds, insurance, property taxes, storage
</p>
<p>and obsolescence (check with controller).

<p>against the letter of credit upon presentation of the required documents. There are
two basic types of letters of credit: revocable and irrevocable. The revocable type can
be changed or canceled at any time by the buyer without the seller&rsquo;s consent and
therefore is seldom used. The irrevocable type can only be changed or canceled upon
agreement of all parties.
</p>
<p>Packaging requirements and costs are usually higher with foreign purchases because
of the longer distances traveled and increased handling of shipments. Each item enter-
ing a country is also subject to a customs duty or tariff. Duty rates vary widely over
seemingly small differences between items. A knowledgeable customs broker may lower
duty costs as well as expedite the shipment through customs. Total cost analysis must
include duty and broker fees incurred during the international transaction.
</p>
<p>International shipments often require insurance protection. This issue is impor-
tant, because unlike domestic transportation, oceangoing carrier liability is generally
limited. Insurance is usually required when a third party is financing the inventory
or shipment, and is provided by large firms such as Lloyd&rsquo;s of London.

<p>Bose Combines Interna-
tional Purchasing and
Supply Chain
Management
</p>
<p>Companies have different experiences and approaches when developing their worldwide
sourcing strategies. Bose Corporation, a manufacturer of some of the world&rsquo;s best-known
high-fidelity speakers, is committed to just-in-time manufacturing, although it has suppliers
located in North America, the Far East, and Europe. The company must blend its desire for
low inventory with the need to buy from distant sources.
</p>
<p>Controlling transportation is a central to Bose&rsquo;s international purchasing strategy. Bose con-
trols its inbound and outbound transportation by taking control of shipments when the sup-
plier turns goods over to a carrier and then relinquishing control only when finished goods
are delivered to Bose&rsquo;s customer.
</p>
<p>Managing a worldwide supply chain requires Bose to rely on a limited number of transporta-
tion suppliers, with whom it has developed mutually beneficial partnership agreements. Bose
has a contract with PIE Nationwide, a national less-than-truckload carrier based in Jackson-
ville, FL, to handle North American transportation requirements. W.N. Proctor Company, a Bos-
ton-based freight forwarder and customs broker, plays a central role in Bose&rsquo;s critical
international shipping. Bose has also established an extensive EDI system called Shipmas-
ter, which allows the company to contact every one of PIE&rsquo;s 230 terminals. If Bose must expe-
dite a shipment, Bose forwards a message directly to PIE&rsquo;s freight terminal.
</p>
<p>What Shipmaster does for domestic freight, ProctorLink does for international cargo. When a ship-
ment goes onto a plane or a ship, it goes into the Proctor system. All of the specifications&mdash;the
ship, customs clearance, and so on&mdash;are included, providing the information needed to control
the inventory. Proctor also provides hands-on service to Bose, such as selecting overseas
agents who help move goods from the Far East to the United States.

<p>Other costs include port terminal and handling fees. Depending on the exact
terms of the purchase contract, a purchaser can expect charges for unloading of
cargo, administrative services of port authority personnel, and general use of the
port; these are U.S. port terminal and handling charges. Even if a purchaser uses a
third party to manage this part of the process and receives a single invoice, these cost
elements are still part of the single involved charge. Someone had to pay these
charges.
</p>
<p>A critical factor during international purchasing is keeping to a minimum the sur-
prises that affect total cost and customer service. For example, if a shipment arrives
in Long Beach, CA, without proper documentation, customs will place the shipment
in warehouse storage awaiting documentation. Whether the buyer or the seller pays
the storage charges should be clear in the event this issue arises.

<p>with international currency fluctuations. Because of this risk, companies often take
steps to reduce the uncertainty associated with fluctuating currencies.
</p>
<p>The following example illustrates the principle of currency fluctuation and risk.
Suppose a U.S. company purchased a machine from Canada in June. The purchase is
denominated in Canadian dollars at $100,000 paid upon delivery in November. For
simplicity, assume the exchange rate in June is $1 U.S. equals $1 Canadian. By No-
vember, however, the Canadian dollar has strengthened to the point where $1 U.S.
equals $0.90 Canadian (it now takes less than one Canadian dollar to purchase a U.S.
dollar; the Canadian currency has appreciated vis-&agrave;-vis the U.S. dollar). Now,
$100,000 U.S. only equals $90,000 Canadian. This U.S. firm needs $100,000 Cana-
dian to pay for the machine, or $100,000 U.S./0.9 exchange rate = $111,111 U.S. If
the purchaser does not protect itself from fluctuating currencies, the machine would
cost $11,111 more than originally planned. On the other hand, if the U.S. dollar
strengthened against the Canadian dollar during this period, the purchase would re-
quire fewer U.S. dollars in November to buy $100,000 Canadian dollars.
</p>
<p>Companies use a variety of measures to address the risk associated with currency
fluctuations. These range from very basic measures to the sophisticated management
of international currencies involving the corporate finance department.
</p>
<p>Purchase in U.S. Dollars
Buyers who prefer to pay for international purchases in U.S. dollars are attempt-
</p>
<p>ing to eliminate currency fluctuations as a source of risk by shifting the risk to the
seller. Although this appears to be an easy method of risk management, it is not al-
ways the best or most feasible approach. The foreign supplier, which is also aware of
currency risks, may be unwilling to accept the risk of currency fluctuations by itself.
Also, many foreign suppliers anticipate exchange rate fluctuations by incorporating a
risk factor into their price. A purchaser willing to accept some of the risk may obtain
a favorable price.
</p>
<p>Sharing Currency Fluctuation Risk
Equal sharing of risk permits a selling firm to price its product without having to
</p>
<p>factor in the acceptance of risk costs. Sharing of risk requires equal division of a
change in an agreed-upon price due to currency fluctuation. In the Canadian ma-

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>chine example, the U.S. firm realized over $11,000 in additional costs due to currency
fluctuations. With equal risk sharing, the Canadian and U.S. firms would evenly di-
vide the additional cost. This technique works best on items that have a set delivery
date, such as capital equipment.
</p>
<p>Currency Adjustment Contract Clauses
With currency adjustment clauses, both parties agree that payment occurs as long
</p>
<p>as exchange rates do not fluctuate outside an agreed-upon range or band. If exchange
rates move outside the agreed-upon range, the parties can renegotiate or review the
contract. This provides a mutual degree of protection because firms do not know
with certainty in which direction exchange rates will fluctuate.
</p>
<p>Purchase contracts often contain one of two types of currency adjustment clauses:
delivery-triggered clauses and time-triggered clauses. Delivery-triggered clauses stipu-
late that the parties will review an exchange before delivery to verify that the rate is
still within the agreed-upon range. If the rate falls outside the range, the buyer or
seller can ask to renegotiate the contract price. Time-triggered clauses stipulate that
both parties will review a contract at specified time intervals to evaluate the impact
of fluctuating exchange rates. The parties review the exchange rate at scheduled inter-
vals, and a new contract is established if the rate falls outside the agreed-upon range.
</p>
<p>Currency Hedging
Hedging involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of currency contracts in two
</p>
<p>markets. The expected result is that a gain realized on one contract will be offset by a
loss on the other. Hedging is a form of risk insurance that can protect both parties
from currency fluctuations. The motivation for using hedging is risk aversion, not
monetary gain. If the purpose of buying currency contracts is to realize a net gain,
then the purchaser is speculating and not hedging.
</p>
<p>Buyers and sellers trade futures exchange contracts (also referred to as &ldquo;futures con-
tracts&rdquo;) on commodity exchanges open to anyone needing to hedge or with specula-
tive risk capital. In fact, the exchanges encourage speculation because speculators
help create markets for buyers and sellers of futures contracts. Traders sell futures con-
tracts in fixed currency amounts with fixed contract lengths.
</p>
<p>Forward exchange contracts have a different focus than futures exchange con-
tracts. Issued by major banks, these contracts are agreements by which a purchaser
pays a pre-established rate for a currency in the future (as well as a fee to the bank).
Trading participants include banks, brokers, and multinational companies. The use
of forward exchange contracts discourages speculation. Forward exchange contracts
meet the needs of an individual purchaser in terms of dollar amount and time limit.
</p>
<p>Finance Department Expertise
Companies with extensive international experience usually have a finance or trea-
</p>
<p>sury department that can support international currency requirements. Finance can
identify the currency a firm should use for payment based on projections of currency
fluctuations. The finance department can also provide advice about hedging and cur-
rency forecasts, and whether to seek a new contract or renegotiate an existing one
due to currency changes; it can also act as a clearinghouse for foreign currencies to
make payment for foreign purchases.

<p>Tracking Currency Movements
Purchasing managers should track the movement of currencies against the dollar
</p>
<p>over time to identify longer-term changes and sourcing opportunities due to chang-
ing economics. The weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro during 2006 made
exports more attractive to European countries. Purchases from Japan became more ex-
pensive to U.S. buyers in the early to mid-1990s as the Japanese yen strengthened in
value from 200 yen to 100 yen per dollar. As a result, there was a financial incentive
to source domestically or from countries where exchange rates were more favorable.
In 2007, the yen stayed in a range between 110 and 120 yen per dollar and has not de-
preciated to the high 100s or the 200s of the mid-1990s.
</p>
<p>Progressing from International Purchasing
to Global Sourcing
</p>
<p>At some point, many companies determine that moving beyond basic interna-
tional purchasing might yield new and untapped benefits. Exhibit 10.6 presents inter-
national purchasing and global sourcing as a series of evolving levels or steps along a
continuum. An internationalization of the sourcing process takes place as firms
evolve or progress first from domestic purchasing to international purchasing, and
then to the global coordination and integration of common items, processes, designs,
technologies, and suppliers across worldwide locations. Level I includes those firms
that only purchase domestically. Sourcing domestically could result in purchases
from international suppliers that have facilities in the United States.
</p>
<p>Referring to Exhibit 10.6, Level II represents basic international purchasing that
is usually reactive and uncoordinated between buying locations or units. Moving
forward, strategies and approaches developed in Level III begin to recognize that a
properly executed worldwide sourcing strategy can result in major improvements.

<p>However, strategies at this level are not well coordinated across worldwide buying lo-
cations, operating centers, functional groups, or business units.
</p>
<p>Level IV, which represents the integration and coordination of sourcing strategies
across worldwide buying locations, represents a sophisticated level of strategy develop-
ment. Operating at this level requires
</p>
<p>&bull; Worldwide information systems
</p>
<p>&bull; Personnel with sophisticated knowledge and skills
</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive coordination and communication mechanisms
</p>
<p>&bull; An organizational structure that promotes central coordination of global
activities
</p>
<p>&bull; Leadership that endorses a global approach to sourcing
</p>
<p>Although worldwide integration occurs in Level IV, which is not the case with Level
III, the integration is primarily cross-locational rather than cross-functional.
</p>
<p>Organizations that operate at Level V have achieved the cross-locational integra-
tion that firms operating at the fourth level have achieved. The primary distinction is
that Level V participants integrate and coordinate common items, processes, designs,
technologies, and suppliers across worldwide purchasing centers and with other func-
tional groups, particularly engineering. This integration occurs during new-product
development as well as during the sourcing of items or services to fulfill continuous
demand or aftermarket requirements.
</p>
<p>Only those firms that have worldwide design, development, production, logistics,
and procurement capabilities can progress to this level. Although many firms expect
to advance to Level V, the reality is that many lack the understanding or the willing-
ness to achieve this level of sophistication.
</p>
<p>Factors Separating Successful from Less-Successful
Global Sourcing Efforts
</p>
<p>A major research project on global sourcing, with 167 companies, identified a set of
factors that drove global sourcing performance. These factors were (1) a defined pro-
cess to support global sourcing, (2) centrally coordinated and centrally led decision mak-
ing, (3) site-based control of operational activities, (4) real-time communication tools,
(5) information sharing with suppliers, (6) availability of critical resources, (7) sourcing
and contracting systems, and (8) international purchasing office support.18 Exhibit 10.7
highlights these success factors, which are explained in more detail in the following
section.
</p>
<p>Defined Process to Support Global Sourcing
The development of a rigorous and well-defined approach or process is critical to
</p>
<p>global sourcing success. Some organizations have taken their commodity or regional
strategy process and adapted it for global sourcing. When this occurs, the global pro-
cess will likely weight certain factors differently (for example, more emphasis placed
on risk factors and total landed cost) compared with a regional commodity develop-
ment process.
</p>
<p>A defined process helps overcome many of the differences inherent in global sourc-
ing. Social culture and laws, personnel skills and abilities, and business culture are

<p>three areas where differences are the greatest across different geographic units. A
global sourcing process helps align very different participants and practices around
the globe. Exhibit 10.8 on p. 372 outlines the global sourcing process at a chemical
company with worldwide operations.
</p>
<p>Centrally Coordinated and Centrally Led Decision Making
Maintaining central control and leadership over activities that are strategic in na-
</p>
<p>ture enhances the probability of achieving a range of improved sourcing process out-
comes. These benefits include
</p>
<p>&bull; Improved standardization or consistency of the sourcing process
</p>
<p>&bull; Early supplier involvement
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier relationships
</p>
<p>&bull; Client, stakeholder, and executive satisfaction with sourcing
</p>
<p>Site-Based and Decentralized Control of Operational Activities
Firms that also decentralize operational activities during global sourcing are likely
</p>
<p>to realize lower total cost of ownership, better inventory management, and improved
performance to external customers. Operational activities at a decentralized level
include
</p>
<p>&bull; Issuing material releases to suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Expediting orders when necessary
</p>
<p>&bull; Resolving performance problems
</p>
<p>&bull; Planning inventory levels
</p>
<p>&bull; Developing logistics plans
</p>
<p>Real-Time Communication Tools
Communication complexity makes global sourcing more complex compared with
</p>
<p>domestic or regional sourcing. Global sourcing participants are often located around
the world, making real-time and face-to-face communication difficult. Furthermore,

forts. Examples include regular review meetings, joint training sessions involving
</p>
<p>Exhibit 10.8 A U.S. Chemical Company&rsquo;s Global Sourcing Process
</p>
<p>Step 1: Identify Global Sourcing Opportunities
</p>
<p>When identifying specific opportunities, an executive steering committee and globalization manager
consider:
</p>
<p>&bull; What business units require the largest cost reductions?
&bull; What does the company currently buy?
&bull; How is the commodity currently specified?
&bull; How much effort will it take to create a worldwide set of specifications?
</p>
<p>Step 2: Establish Global Sourcing Development Teams
</p>
<p>The executive steering committee forms cross-functional/cross-locational (CF/CL) teams with world-
wide members to pursue global opportunities.
</p>
<p>Step 3: Propose Global Strategy
</p>
<p>A team charter provides project teams with responsibility for proposing a global strategy. Teams vali-
date the original assumptions underlying the project, verify current volumes and expected savings, de-
termine if global suppliers exist, evaluate the current set of specifications between design centers,
and propose a global strategy.
</p>
<p>Step 4: Develop Request for Proposal (RFP) Specifications
</p>
<p>Teams are responsible for developing the request for proposal (RFP) that suppliers receive. This step
consumes a large portion of the global sourcing process time.
</p>
<p>Step 5: Release RFPs to Suppliers
</p>
<p>On average, six suppliers receive an RFP during a global project. Project teams are responsible for fol-
lowing up with suppliers and answering any questions.
</p>
<p>Step 6: Evaluate Bids or Proposals
</p>
<p>A commercial and technical evaluation of supplier proposals occurs. Project teams will ask suppli-
ers for their best and final offer and conduct site visits as required. Face-to-face negotiation occurs
after analyzing the RFPs returned from suppliers.
</p>
<p>Step 7: Negotiate with Suppliers
</p>
<p>A smaller team negotiates with suppliers to finalize contract details. All negotiations are conducted
at the buying company&rsquo;s U.S. headquarters and can last up to three days. The negotiation process
lengthens if the buying company does not achieve its price and service targets.
</p>
<p>Step 8: Award Contract(s)
</p>
<p>Information concerning the awarded contract is communicated throughout the company via e-mail.
The steering committee calculates expected savings and maintains the agreements in a corporate
database.
</p>
<p>Step 9: Implement Contract and Manage Supplier(s)
</p>
<p>This step involves loading global agreements into the appropriate corporate systems. It also involves
managing the transition to new suppliers and/or part numbers.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>worldwide team members, regularly reported project updates through an intranet,
and co-location of functional personnel. A common approach for coordinating work
efforts is to rely on audio conferencing with a scheduled time for conference calls, usu-
ally on a weekly basis. Participants should take advantage of evolving web-based com-
munication tools, including NetMeeting, Centra, and web-based cameras. One
conclusion is clear: Successful global sourcing efforts feature well-established commu-
nication methods to help overcome the inherent complexities of the process.
</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine a successful global sourcing effort without access to reliable
and timely information. Examples of such information include a listing of existing con-
tracts and suppliers, reports on supplier capabilities and performance, worldwide vol-
umes by purchase type and location, and information about potential new suppliers.
The ability to provide the data and information that global sourcing requires demands
the development of global information technology systems and data warehouses.
</p>
<p>Although access to a common coding system and real-time data is a major facilita-
tor, the reality is that many firms lack essential IT capabilities. Many companies have
historically grouped their procurement and engineering centers by region, whereas
other companies that are the result of mergers and acquisitions usually feature differ-
ent legacy systems, processes, and part numbers across locations. This forces firms to
spend time and money to standardize and commonize their systems and coding
schemes. Part number and commodity coding schemes have the second-lowest level
of similarity from a list of 20 items when looking across all companywide locations.
</p>
<p>Information Sharing with Suppliers
Successful global sourcing requires both access to a range of critical information
</p>
<p>and the willingness to share that information with important suppliers on a world-
wide basis. Firms that share performance information with their most important
worldwide suppliers realize lower purchase price and cost. Shared performance infor-
mation includes details about supplier quality, delivery, cycle time, and flexibility. A
second type of information sharing relates to broader outcomes. This includes assess-
ment of the supplier&rsquo;s technological sophistication, future capital plans, and product
variety data.
</p>
<p>Availability of Critical Resources
Resources that affect global success include budget support for travel, access to
</p>
<p>qualified personnel, time for personnel to develop global strategies, and the availabil-
ity of required information and data. The availability of time was correlated highly
with team effectiveness. Teams that had the time to pursue their agenda were more ef-
fective than those that did not have the time. This is very important given the fact
that most organizations use teams to coordinate their global efforts.
</p>
<p>Sourcing and Contracting Systems
The most important way to ensure access to information is to develop technology
</p>
<p>systems that make critical information available on a worldwide basis. Firms that
have systems that provide access to relevant information are more likely to report
lower total costs of ownership and improved sourcing process outcomes from global
sourcing. Examples of these features and the information they provide include a
worldwide database of purchased goods and services; common part coding schemes;

</p>
<p>International Purchasing Office Support
As previously mentioned, IPOs support a higher level of global sourcing through
</p>
<p>greater access to product and process technology, reduced cycle times, and increased
responsiveness. Additionally, the IPOs have the capabilities to provide operational
support from initial negotiations through the contract management phase of the sup-
plier selection cycle. The increasing movement to global sourcing has been enhanced
by the growth of IPOs over the past five years.
</p>
<p>Global Sourcing Benefits
Perhaps one of the most revealing and interesting differences between the interna-
</p>
<p>tional purchasing and global sourcing segments is the perception each has regarding
the benefits they realize from their worldwide efforts. Exhibit 10.9 presents the top-
rated benefits for each group. Although this exhibit presents only 10 benefit areas,
firms that engage in global sourcing indicate they realize 16 total benefits at a statisti-
cally higher level than firms that engage in international purchasing. In fact, the aver-
age rating across all benefit areas is 30% higher for global sourcing firms compared
with the overall average for international purchasing firms.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>One benefit that both segments rate highly is the ability to achieve a lower pur-
chase price or cost through worldwide sourcing. The initial benefits from interna-
tional purchasing are usually price focused and are often available from basic
international purchasing activities. However, firms realize many nonprice benefits
only after they have taken steps to evolve toward higher sourcing levels. In particular,
this includes greater access to product and process technology, an outcome that is par-
ticularly critical given the more dynamic technology changes that global sourcing
firms face. Better management of supply chain inventory is also a benefit that global
sourcing firms enjoy at higher levels. This is critical given the emphasis that many
firms place on managing costs and inventory investment across the supply chain.
</p>
<p>Other important benefits more readily available from global sourcing include
greater supplier responsiveness, greater sourcing process consistency, improved sup-
plier relationships, and improved sharing of information with suppliers. The benefits
realized between the two groups help explain why so many firms that pursue interna-
tional purchasing want to evolve toward global sourcing.

<p>developments include the need to agree on global performance measures and to estab-
lish integrated systems between worldwide units and with suppliers. Doing this re-
quires the continued development and refinement of integrated and coordinated
global sourcing strategies across the functional organization. Greater integration be-
tween marketing, engineering, and sourcing groups should occur as firms evolve to-
ward higher globalization levels.
</p>
<p>We also expect a trend toward doing business with suppliers that have global capa-
bilities. In addition, the focus of global sourcing will shift from part (i.e., component)
sourcing to subsystems, systems, and services. Cost reduction pressures will also re-
sult in continued sourcing in low-cost emerging supply markets, such as China and
Eastern Europe. Although very attractive from a price standpoint, these markets have
hidden costs that must be identified. The ability to manage these changes will begin
to separate leading companies from average firms.
</p>
<p>Companies that produce and sell worldwide should no longer view global sourc-
ing as an emerging approach to sourcing. The pursuit of a competitive advantage re-
quires the development of global processes and strategies that become an integral
part of a firm&rsquo;s supply management efforts. Understanding the critical differences be-
tween international purchasing and integrated global sourcing is essential before man-
agers can begin to realize the benefits that this complex approach to sourcing
potentially offers.
</p>
<p>Good Practice
Example
</p>
<p>Air Products Manages
Worldwide Sourcing
</p>
<p>One company that has actively pursued integrated global sourcing is Air Products and
Chemicals, a U.S.-based company that designs and operates industrial gas and chemical fa-
cilities worldwide. In 1999, company executives were surprised when an internal study con-
cluded that the company would have to lower operating costs by 30% to remain competitive
globally. Low-cost competitors had emerged in Asia and the Pacific, and industrial buyers
were increasingly viewing the company&rsquo;s products as commodity items, factors that together
created extensive downward pricing pressures.
</p>
<p>Company managers concluded that one way to improve performance was global sourcing. His-
torically, the company operated in an engineer-to-order environment, using regional design
and procurement centers. The result was highly customized design and procurement for each
new project. Further, there was a lack of coordination between the company&rsquo;s North Ameri-
can and European units.
</p>
<p>These new competitive pressures compelled the company to coordinate design and sourcing
activities across its worldwide locations. Accomplishing this resulted in the development of a
global engineering and procurement process. The design of each new facility now involves
an extensive analysis between U.S. and European centers to identify areas of commonality,
standardization, and synergy in procurement and design. Cross-functional teams, with mem-
bers from the United States and Europe working jointly, develop common design specifica-
tions and contracts that satisfy each center&rsquo;s needs while supporting future replacement
and maintenance requirements.

<p>After five years of global sourcing experience and with more than 100 global agreements in
place, Air Products is averaging 20% in cost savings compared with the regional sourcing
and design practices. Furthermore, worldwide design and procurement centers have better
aligned their sourcing philosophies and strategies among the centers and with the com-
pany&rsquo;s business strategy. Procurement managers now work with marketing to include ex-
pected savings from in-process global sourcing projects when responding to customer
proposals. Integrated global sourcing is providing a new source of competitiveness to a com-
pany that operates in a mature industry.

<p>CONCLUSION
International purchases for raw materials, components, finished goods, and ser-
</p>
<p>vices will continue to increase. Because of this, supply management personnel at all
levels must become familiar with the nuances of worldwide sourcing. Although most
organizations would prefer to purchase from suppliers that are geographically close,
this is not always possible. Firms operating in competitive industries must purchase
from the best available sources worldwide. Developing these sources requires contin-
ual monitoring of both supply market and country trends. Currently the hot spots
for sourcing are China and India. Less publicized but just as important is the low-
cost-country sourcing occurring in Eastern Europe. Globalization will continue to be
a major force that needs to be assessed on a company-by-company basis. Once the as-
sessment is made, then supply management must respond with an effective global
strategy.

<p>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. Discuss whether globalization and the subsequent growth in worldwide sourcing
will have a positive or negative effect over the long run in the United States.
Why? What are the alternatives to worldwide sourcing?
</p>
<p>2. China, India, and other developing countries are sourcing hot spots. Explain why
and also discuss any problems you see in sourcing from these low-cost countries.
</p>
<p>3. What are the most important reasons for pursuing worldwide sourcing today?
</p>
<p>4. Discuss what the following statement means: Leading-edge companies must de-
velop personnel who have global perspectives. Should personnel from organiza-
tions of all sizes have a global perspective? Why?
</p>
<p>5. What are the advantages of establishing an international purchasing office? What
services do these offices provide?
</p>
<p>6. How does the international part-sourcing process differ from the domestic sourc-
ing process?
</p>
<p>7. Discuss the reasons why a firm would use a third-party external agent for world-
wide sourcing.
</p>
<p>8. Discuss some of the sources of information a buyer can use to identify potential

<p>10. What is the difference between outsourcing and offshoring? What functions does
a firm choose to offshore and why?
</p>
<p>11. During the 1980s, many U.S. firms pursued worldwide sourcing on a reactive ba-
sis. What does this mean? What might cause a firm to shift from reactive world-
wide sourcing to a proactive approach to worldwide sourcing?
</p>
<p>12. What are the factors that separate successful from less-successful global sourcing
efforts?
</p>
<p>13. Refer to the barriers to worldwide sourcing that many firms confront. For each
barrier, discuss one or more ways that a company can overcome the barrier.
</p>
<p>14. What form of countertrade appears to offer the most purchase flexibility? Why?
</p>
<p>15. Some purchasing managers regard countertrade as an infringement of purchas-
ing&rsquo;s authority. Why might some purchasing personnel not view countertrade
favorably?

<p>Southwest Shrugs Off Oil Prices
</p>
<p>The surge in oil prices in 2007 has impacted many industries, not least of which is
the airline industry. Fuel costs make up a significant portion of airline operating costs. One
airline, Southwest, has used this fact to its advantage in the current high-fuel-cost environ-
ment. Although Southwest has for many years dominated the industry because of better ser-
vice and happier and more productive workers, the reason for Southwest&rsquo;s rapidly increasing
advantage in recent years is that it simply loaded up years ago on hedges against higher
fuel prices. With oil trading above $90 a barrel, most of the rest of the airline industry is fac-
ing a huge run-up in costs. Southwest, however, owns long-term contracts to buy most of its
fuel through 2009 for what it would cost if oil were $51 a barrel. The value of these hedges
soared as oil raced above $90 a barrel, and they are now worth more than $2 billion. These
gains will be mostly realized over the next two years. Other airlines passed on buying all but
the shortest-term insurance against high fuel prices, such that they could start reporting
losses as early as 2008, unless they are able to rapidly raise fares. At American Airlines,
annual fuel costs rise $80 million for every dollar increase in a barrel of oil, said their CFO,
Thomas Horton.
</p>
<p>In January 2007, other airlines were enjoying the prospect of Southwest&rsquo;s misery as oil
dipped down to about $52 a barrel. Southwest&rsquo;s hedges cap most of its fuel needs at about
$51 a barrel, so they were of little use at that point. Southwest also has the highest labor
rates in the industry, because they have not demanded deep wage concessions from workers.
Southwest&rsquo;s hedges used during the first nine months of 2007, which included options that
allowed&mdash;but did not require&mdash;it to buy energy products at certain prices, cost $42 million.
This is a small sum in retrospect, but was not so easily spent when higher oil prices were
only a possibility. Now, the other airlines are kicking themselves for not having hedged fuel
costs. &ldquo;We all wish we were Southwest,&rdquo; said Tim Walker, a JetBlue officer who manages its
fuel contracts. &ldquo;Southwest was just gorgeous with what they did years ago. They put their
foot down.&rdquo; To compensate, other airlines have had six industry fare increases in the third
quarter, whereas Southwest&rsquo;s average ticket price was only 62 cents higher than a year ear-
lier. The question for Southwest is whether it can turn yet another huge temporary advantage
into a long-term edge. Its revenue-raising ideas are relatively modest, but it faces labor nego-
tiations with its main worker groups, none of whom want to make concessions. Gary Kelly,
the chief executive, noted that &ldquo;this cycle could and should be another one of those times
we can prevail.&rdquo; Southwest generally expects high fuel prices to prevail, and if it sees what
it thinks is a short-term decline in oil prices, the carrier would consider adding to its hedges
for years beyond 2009. In hindsight, executives at Southwest feel that they should have
picked up even more when prices were lower.

<p>In today&rsquo;s economy, the driving force behind global competition can be summarized
in a single equation:
</p>
<p>Value &frac14; &eth;Quality &thorn; Technology &thorn; Service &thorn; Cycle Time&THORN;=Price
Although purchasing has a major impact on all of the variables in the numerator
</p>
<p>in this equation, this chapter focuses on the denominator: price, and its primary
driver, cost. A major responsibility of purchasing is to ensure that the price paid for
an item is fair and reasonable. The price paid for purchased products and services
will have a direct impact on the end customer&rsquo;s perception of value provided by the
organization, thereby leading to a competitive advantage in the marketplace. By deliv-
ering value through continued progress in reducing costs, and thereby improving
profit margins and return on assets for enterprises, purchasing is truly becoming a
force of its own within the executive boardroom.
</p>
<p>Evaluation of a supplier&rsquo;s actual cost to provide the product or service, versus the
actual purchase price paid, is an ongoing challenge within all industries. In many
situations, the need to control costs requires a focus on the costs associated with pro-
ducing an item or service, versus simply analyzing final price. In these cases, innova-
tive pricing approaches involve cost identification as a process leading to agreement
on a final price. In other cases, however, purchasing may not need to spend much ef-
fort understanding costs, and will focus instead on whether the price is fair given com-
petitive market conditions.
</p>
<p>Purchasing and supply chain specialists must understand the principles of price
and cost analysis. Price analysis refers to the process of comparing supplier prices
against external price benchmarks, without direct knowledge of the supplier&rsquo;s costs.
Price analysis focuses simply on a seller&rsquo;s price with little or no consideration given
to the actual cost of production. In contrast, cost analysis is the process of analyzing
each individual cost element (i.e., material, labor hours and rates, overhead, general
and administrative costs, and profit) that together add up to the final price. Ideally,
this analysis identifies the actual cost to produce an item so the parties to a contract
can determine a fair and reasonable price and develop plans to achieve future cost re-
ductions. Finally, total cost analysis applies the price/cost equation across multiple pro-
cesses that span two or more organizations across a supply chain. For example, the
total cost of shipping a good manufactured from China into the United States may
include shipping, tariffs, inventory, quality, and other costs that are over and above
the actual price paid to the Chinese manufacturer.
</p>
<p>This chapter presents a traditional discussion of price and cost fundamentals
along with a number of innovative price and cost management tools that can be ap-
plied using available information on the Internet and simple spreadsheet analysis.
Some of these tools are price analysis, reverse price analysis, and total cost analysis.
By applying such tools, purchasers can evolve toward a system of strategic cost man-
agement that seeks to reduce costs across the entire supply chain. Although not all of
these tools are appropriate for every situation, supply managers must learn to recog-
nize when and how such tools can be applied.

against higher fuel prices.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A Structured Approach to Cost Reduction
Managers are increasingly considering the implications of price and cost manage-
</p>
<p>ment from a total supply chain perspective, as shown in Exhibit 11.1. In the past,
many companies focused their cost efforts on internal cost management initiatives.
These included approaches such as value analysis, process improvements, standardiza-
tion, improvements in efficiency by utilizing technology, and others. Although these
approaches are still relevant, the impact that they have on the majority of costs is not
as great as in the past. Why? With the increased amount of outsourcing occurring in
every global company today, the majority of the cost of goods sold is driven by suppli-
ers, which are outside of the four walls of an organization. In this environment, orga-
nizations wanting to fully capture the benefits of cost-reduction initiatives must
implement approaches that include both upstream and downstream members of
their supply chains. Such a change requires a fundamental shift in thinking in the
minds of managers and employees.
</p>
<p>This new generation of cost management initiatives requires that purchasing and
logistics executives adopt a series of new initiatives that can deliver results to the bot-
tom line. As shown in Exhibit 11.2 on p. 386, strategic cost management approaches
typically involve at least two supply chain partners working together to identify
process improvements that reduce costs across the supply chain. Examples include
team-based value-engineering efforts, supplier development and kaizen events, cross-
enterprise cost-reduction projects, joint brainstorming efforts on new products, sup-
plier suggestion programs, and supply chain redesign efforts. These types of efforts
require that both parties commit to achieving cost-reduction strategies that go beyond
simple haggling over prices.
</p>
<p>Strategic cost management approaches will vary according to the stage of the prod-
uct life cycle. As shown in Exhibit 11.3 on p. 387, various approaches are appropriate
at different product life cycle stages. In the initial concept and development stage, pur-
chasing will often act proactively to establish cost targets. Target costing/target

<p>pricing is a technique developed originally in Japanese organizations in the 1980s to
combat the inflation of the yen against other currencies. Target pricing, quality func-
tion deployment, and technology sharing are all effective approaches for cost reduc-
tion used at this stage.
</p>
<p>As a product or service enters the design and launch stages, supplier integration,
standardization, value engineering, and design for manufacturing can improve the op-
portunity to use standard parts and techniques, leverage volumes, and create opportu-
nities for cost savings. During the product or service launch, purchasing will adopt
more traditional cost-reduction approaches, including competitive bidding, negotia-
tion, value analysis, volume leveraging, service contracts focusing on savings, and link-
ing longer-term pricing to extended contracts. As a product reaches its end of life,
purchasing cannot ignore the potential value of environmental initiatives to remanu-
facture, recycle, or refurbish products that are becoming obsolete. As an example of
this, print cartridge manufacturers such as Xerox and Hewlett-Packard have devel-
oped innovative technologies that allow customers to recycle laser toner cartridges,
which are subsequently refurbished and used again, eliminating landfill costs.
</p>
<p>The major benefits from cost-reduction efforts occur when purchasing is involved
early in the new-product/service development cycle. When sourcing decisions are
made early in the product life cycle, the full effects of a sourcing decision over the
product&rsquo;s life can be considered. When purchasing is involved later in the product
development cycle, efforts to reduce costs have a minimal impact because the major
decisions regarding types of materials, labor rates, and choice of suppliers have
already been made. A manager in a major automotive company described this situa-
tion as follows: &ldquo;In the past, we allowed engineering to determine the specifications,
the materials, and the supplier. In fact, the supplier already produced the first proto-
type! That&rsquo;s when they decided to call in purchasing to develop the contract. How

<p>much leverage do you have in convincing the supplier to reduce costs when the sup-
plier already knows they are guaranteed the business, and they have already sunk
money into a fixed design and tooling for the product?&rdquo;1
</p>
<p>When prioritizing efforts to reduce costs, companies often apply a structured
framework for cost reduction similar to the one illustrated in Exhibit 11.4. This frame-
work is consistent with the portfolio analysis framework developed in Chapter 6 and
should be integrated into an organization&rsquo;s commodity strategy development process.
As shown in Exhibit 11.4, each approach requires a different strategic focus in terms
of price versus cost. In general, low-value generics in which a competitive market
with many potential suppliers exists should emphasize total delivered price. There is
no need to spend time conducting a detailed cost analysis for low-value items that do
not produce significant returns. Greater returns can be obtained by having users or-
der these products or services directly through supplier catalogs, procurement cards,
or other e-procurement technologies. Commodities are high-value products or ser-
vices that also have a competitive market situation; for example, computers and tech-
nology are certainly in this category (as discussed in the opening vignette). These
types of products and services can be sourced through traditional bidding approaches
that require price analysis using market forces to do the work and identify what is a
competitive price. With greater standardization being introduced in many industries,
products once considered as critical are being moved into the commodities quadrant.
</p>
<p>Unique products present a different challenge: Companies must strive to reduce
costs for products with few available suppliers, yet that are still low value. Examples
include suppliers of unique fasteners, specialty papers, and specialty MRO items. For
such items, purchasers will want to identify suppliers that are charging too high a
price. Further analysis of their pricing through a technique known as &ldquo;reverse price
analysis&rdquo; (discussed later in the chapter) may identify price discrepancies that can be re-
duced through greater standardization of user requirements or ongoing negotiations

Snapshot
</p>
<p>Global Commodity
Markets Shifting
</p>
<p>In 2007, the latest demand boom for base metals is in its third year and has elevated
nonferrous metals pricing to record highs. Steel prices are reflecting iron ore, scrap, ferro-
alloy, and energy costs&mdash;rather than demand trends&mdash;probably for the first time.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pricing cycles for commodities are shrinking,&rdquo; says the global procurement manager at a De-
troit-area auto parts company. &ldquo;The steel cycle used to be 7 to 10 years in length from peak
to valley in prices. Nowadays, it&rsquo;s more like 18 months due to the rapid change in delivery
of information.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Atop all that, says Peter Connelly, CPO at diversified manufacturer Leggett &amp; Platt, &ldquo;supplier
consolidation and pricing volatility is making forecasting difficult and, actually, past a 90-
day window, very inaccurate.&rdquo; Rather than being a sign of the top for commodity prices, ana-
lysts worry that the deal-making could help put a lid on supply and put even more pressure
on a host of commodity prices.
</p>
<p>This view is supported by research director Anirvan Banerji at the Economic Cycle Research In-
stitute in New York. Most forecasters have a dismal record of predicting the timing of cycli-
cal turns in economic growth, jobs, and inflation, he writes, &ldquo;because most people and
forecasting models expect recent patterns to persist in the near future.&rdquo; This is &ldquo;a sure rec-
ipe for being surprised on prices by the next turn in the global industrial cycle.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>And then, there is nature. The late-summer hurricanes of 2005 taught energy and petrochemi-
cal buyers just how fast supply can be disrupted and prices can explode.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about energy and raw materials these days,&rdquo; says Dan DiMicco, CEO of Nucor Corp.,
the Charlotte, NC&ndash;based steelmaker. &ldquo;With the volatility in and high level of materials pric-
ing nowadays, nobody wants to carry inventory&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s in the raw materials at my
mills or the finished products we ship to our customers.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Stating that &ldquo;in a commodity market today, intelligence is king,&rdquo; DiMicco told a recent steel
industry conference that &ldquo;to run as efficiently as we can, mills and service centers will have
to start at the customer&mdash;and talk to buyers about what they really need and what they ex-
pect they will be paying. Only then can we take some volatility out of the metals market&mdash;
and come to some equitable long-term arrangements on price and supply.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>So, the foundation for any successful commodity-forecasting program must be based on de-
tailed market knowledge that can smooth out current volatility and help ensure against dis-
rupted flow of raw materials, says Mike Burns, global business director for polyethylene at
supply chain consultancy Resin Technology Inc. in Fort Worth, Texas.
</p>
<p>Burns insists that buyers &ldquo;emerge from their comfortable silos&rdquo; and get knowledgeable
about global economics, supply, demand, and sourcing alternatives&mdash;&ldquo;whatever they need to
know to become expert about their company, their industry, and their regional and global sup-
ply chain.&rdquo; Solid market facts are needed to develop effective buying plans, and that in-
cludes accurate price forecasting, says Burns.

<p>with problematic suppliers. In effect, this may mean transitioning a product or ser-
vice from the unique quadrant to the generics quadrant. Many of the commodities
previously thought to belong in the generics quadrant are shifting to strategic, based
on global capacity and demand forecasts for 2008 onwards (see Sourcing Snapshot:
Global Commodity Markets Shifting).
</p>
<p>The major focus of a purchaser&rsquo;s efforts to reduce costs should be on critical prod-
ucts where relatively few suppliers exist but the items are higher value. Managers
should commit time to exploring opportunities for value analysis/engineering, cost-
savings sharing, collaborative efforts focused on identifying cost drivers, and supplier
integration early in the product development cycle. Cost analysis involves breaking
down a supplier&rsquo;s price into its cost elements to uncover potential cost savings and,
hence, price reductions.
</p>
<p>The remainder of this chapter presents a discussion of price analysis (commodi-
ties and generics quadrants), cost analysis (unique and critical quadrants), and total
cost analysis (all four quadrants) that can be applied to help control the costs associ-
ated with these different purchased goods and services.
</p>
<p>Price Analysis
In order to understand the factors affecting pricing levels in a given market, it is
</p>
<p>crucial to employ a market analysis&mdash;an analytical tool that identifies the primary ex-
ternal forces that are causing prices to either increase or decrease. As shown in Ex-
hibit 11.5, prices are driven to a large extent by the degree of competition in a
market, as well as by conditions of supply and demand. The resulting market prices
are indicated by a heavier line, depending on the volume of supply in a given
situation.
</p>
<p>When demand exceeds supply, a seller&rsquo;s market exists, and prices generally in-
crease. The reverse situation, a buyer&rsquo;s market, occurs when supply exceeds demand,

<p>and prices generally move downward. There should be an appreciation for the vari-
ety of variables that directly and indirectly influence an item&rsquo;s price.
</p>
<p>Market Structure
Although it is clear that the supplier&rsquo;s market condition has a major influence on
</p>
<p>price, the factors affecting market conditions are not always easy to predict. Market
environment is often driven by the number of competitors in an industry, the rela-
tive similarity (or lack thereof) of their products, and any existing barriers to entry
for new competitors. At one end of the scale, there may exist a monopoly, where
only one supplier can provide a given product or service. A good example of this con-
dition exists in the pharmaceutical industry, where the company first to market with
a new patented drug has exclusive rights to sell the product for seven years. (At the
end of this period, generics, which copy the drug&rsquo;s formulation, enter the market,
thereby driving down the cost of the drug.)
</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum is perfect competition, in which there exist iden-
tical products with minimal barriers for new suppliers to enter the market. Price is
solely a function of the forces of supply and demand. No single seller or producer con-
trols enough of the market to affect the market price. Of course, a seller could reduce
its price with the hope of selling additional products. In the long run, however, this
simply results in lost revenue.
</p>
<p>An industry with only a few large competitors is classified as oligopolistic. The mar-
ket and pricing strategies of one competitor directly influence others within the indus-
try. Examples of oligopolies in the United States historically include the steel,
automobile, and appliance industries. Within an oligopolistic industry, a firm may as-
sume the role of a price leader and raise or lower prices, which can result in all other
firms changing their prices or choosing to maintain existing price levels. If others do
not follow, the initiating firm might be forced to reverse the change. The growth of in-
ternational trade and competition has created additional choices in many industries,
shifting market power away from the producer and toward the purchaser.
</p>
<p>Economic Conditions
Economic conditions often determine whether a market is favorable to the seller or
</p>
<p>to the purchaser. When capacity utilization at producers is high (supply is tight) and de-
mand for output is strong, supply and demand factors combine to create pricing condi-
tions favorable to the seller. When this occurs, buyers often attempt to keep prices or
price increases below the industry average. When an industry is in a decline, pur-
chasers can take advantage of this to negotiate favorable supply arrangements.
</p>
<p>The macroeconomy influences prices; for example, interest rate levels influence
the internal rate of return at a supplier&mdash;the overall cost of capital, which drives pro-
ductive investment. Even the level of the dollar in relation to other currencies influ-
ences price, particularly for international purchasing. Also, tight labor markets can
create cost increases, resulting in higher purchase prices.
</p>
<p>Knowledge of economic conditions is helpful when identifying the market factors af-
fecting the supply and demand for a product or commodity. Awareness of current and
forecasted economic conditions assists in the development of purchase budgets and ma-
terial forecasts, and also provides valuable insights when developing future price negoti-
ating strategies. One good source of information is the website for the Institute for
Supply Management, www.ism.ws, which presents key data on pricing trends for a

<p>variety of commodities. Other sources of pricing trends in commodity markets can be
found in industry-specific trade associations, such as Pulp and Paper World (for prices
on different grades of pulp and paper: www.paperloop.com), or Textile World (for
prices on Texas, Memphis, and California cotton: www.textileworld.com).
</p>
<p>Pricing Strategy of the Seller
Sellers pursue different strategies or approaches that affect the pricing of their prod-
</p>
<p>ucts or services. Some sellers rely on a detailed analysis of internal cost structures to
establish price, whereas others simply price at a level comparable to the competition.
</p>
<p>The pricing strategy of the seller has a direct impact on quoted prices. In order to
remain in business, suppliers must cover their costs and earn an overall profit to pro-
vide for meeting their corporate objectives. In many cases, however, the price charged
by a seller may have little or no relationship to actual costs. As strange as this seems,
pricing strategies are often based on other factors that are important to the seller. A
seller may quote an unusually low price to secure a purchase contract, with the inten-
tion of raising the price once it drives competition from the marketplace. In other
cases, the seller may exploit its position when it senses it has the purchaser over a bar-
rel by charging an excessive price. In still other cases, the seller may simply not under-
stand its own costs.
</p>
<p>Several questions should be asked when analyzing a seller&rsquo;s pricing strategy. These
include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Does the seller have a long-term pricing strategy, or is it short-term in
nature?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the seller a price leader (sets new pricing levels in the market), or a price
follower (only matches price increases/decreases when the competition
does so)?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the seller attempting to establish entry barriers to other competitors by
establishing a low price initially, then preparing to raise prices in the
future?
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the seller using a cost-based pricing approach, which develops price as a
function of true costs, or a market-based pricing approach? If a market-
based pricing approach is being used, there may be little need for conduct-
ing a detailed cost analysis, as the price charged may be unrelated to any
elements of cost.
</p>
<p>The elements that make up the price charged by a supplier are shown in Exhibit
11.6. Essentially, the supplier&rsquo;s costs include materials and labor (which together
make up manufacturing cost), plus overhead and sales, general and administrative ex-
penses (which cumulatively establish the supplier&rsquo;s total cost), plus margin, which
then equates to the price charged. Based on the interplay between these different ele-
ments, which may vary depending on the supplier&rsquo;s pricing model, the price charged
to a buyer can vary significantly. Seller pricing strategies can be grouped into two cate-
gories: market-driven models and cost-based models. As we noted earlier, price analy-
sis involves having the supply manager gauge the pricing strategy used by the
supplier, without going into the details of how its detailed cost elements are estab-
lished. We will cover market-driven pricing models first, then cover cost analysis tech-
niques later in the chapter.S

<p>Market-Driven Pricing Models2
</p>
<p>Price Volume Model
In the price volume model, the supplier analyzes the market to find the combina-
</p>
<p>tion of price per unit and quantity of sales that maximizes its profit on the assump-
tion that (1) lowering the price will result in more units being sold, and (2) greater
volume will spread the indirect cost over more units, therefore maintaining or even in-
creasing the profit as it relates to the price. The most basic example of this model is
the supplier&rsquo;s offering quantity price breaks to induce the buyer to purchase in larger
quantities (a core approach adopted by Sam&rsquo;s Club and Costco stores). Strategic sourc-
ing initiatives should always engage a thorough analysis of the relationship between
price and quantity in different marketplaces.
</p>
<p>Combining purchase requirements across separate operating units can yield sav-
ings in tooling, setup, and operating efficiencies. A major benefit of reduced or single
sourcing is a lower price that results from the higher volumes offered to a supplier.
In return for a purchase contract with higher volumes, a buyer expects favorable pric-
ing because a supplier should realize lower per-unit costs. The willingness of a sup-
plier to offer quantity discounts also affects the final selling price.
</p>
<p>Although a quantity discount has a positive effect on the purchase price, a pur-
chaser must be cautious about the net impact on the total cost of the item. Buying in
larger-than-normal quantities requires additional storage of purchased goods. At a
time when most firms are reducing or even eliminating inventory, the additional
inventory-carrying costs must be evaluated against the benefit of the quantity discount.
</p>
<p>Market-Share Model
In the market-share model, pricing is based on the assumption that long-run profit-
</p>
<p>ability depends on the market share obtained by the supplier. This approach, also re-
ferred to as &ldquo;penetration pricing,&rdquo; is an aggressive pricing approach for efficient

<p>Higher Pipeline Costs
Forecast
</p>
<p>Across the board, one of the biggest challenges facing the pipeline supply market to-
day is human resources. Indeed, the issue of available personnel was one of the primary
topics of discussion at the Pipeline and Gas Journal&rsquo;s third annual Pipeline Opportunities3
</p>
<p>Conference held in March 2007. Many operators and service providers expressed concerns
about an aging workforce and the lack of younger people moving into the industry. Senior ex-
ecutives expressed concern that the personnel crisis could have some severe impacts on fu-
ture pipeline development. As one executive noted, &ldquo;We in the pipeline industry have been
successful with the pipeline contractors in placing in service a number of large projects on
time and on budget. At the same time we have another slate of projects where we haven&rsquo;t
been as successful. They were either delayed or had significant cost overruns.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this recent phenomenon.
</p>
<p>One of the root causes is that much of the existing infrastructure in pipelines has outlived
its useful life. A significant amount of existing pipe in the United States was put in the
ground in the 1930s and 1940s, and was designed to have a lifetime of 40 years. Today, 70
years down the path, much of this pipeline now has to be replaced. This has not gone unno-
ticed by the Department of Transportation, which regulates 85&ndash;90% of pipeline activity. Two
years ago, new regulations on the nation&rsquo;s pipelines dictated that anyone that was moving
liquids had to inspect all of these pipelines by 2007 (by 2009 for gas pipelines). The unfortu-
nate fact is that much of the infrastructure has not been inspected in years, and most oil
and gas companies have never inspected them for corrosion.
</p>
<p>To cope with this situation, oil and gas companies, and engineering, procurement, and con-
struction companies are running smart gauges through the infrastructure (magnetic calipers
that run through the pipe). These companies are realizing that in general much of the pipe
is in awful shape. To repair the pipe, maintenance crews have to expose it, identify the ex-
tent to which the corrosion exists, and decide whether to keep it or not. If not, the pipe must
be replaced. As a result, there has been a huge boom in inspection, maintenance, and re-
placement of the existing pipelines, which has drawn significantly on the labor resources for
pipeline engineering and tank maintenance crews.
</p>
<p>Certain Western regions such as the Barnett Shale area in Texas, new finds in Colorado, as
well as discoveries in the other lower 48 states will drive new demand, as these geographies
have no infrastructure and are being developed. As a result there is a rush to develop new
pipelines as well&mdash;another draw on resources.
</p>
<p>Another draw is the vast number of other major projects under way globally. For example, a
new LNG program in Louisiana uses the same labor classifications. The energy industry in
the Gulf Coast region is undergoing an impressive expansion with projects worth about $260
billion under development. Contributing to this outstanding growth is the simultaneous peak-
ing of all three sectors of the industry&mdash;upstream, midstream, and downstream&mdash;happening
for the first time in many years. Strong global oil demand growth, fueled primarily by the
emergence of China and India as new world economic powerhouses, and availability of reli-
able low-cost feedstock in the Gulf Coast have provided an ideal opportunity for the region&rsquo;s
energy industry to move up the value chain and add refining and petrochemical capacity.
This euphoria has contributed to a glut of projects, amounting to 3 million barrels per day of

<p>producers because price is a direct function of cost. Penetration pricing can lead to
faster market penetration for a product because of the lower profit margins a seller is
willing to accept. Generally speaking, the seller is willing to take a lower price be-
cause of the potential mass market appeal of the product, resulting in substantially
higher sales volumes. In the initial stages of this model, the supplier may even accept
losses, but as its volume increases, the cost per unit decreases and long-term profits
are achieved. A word of caution is in order here: Purchasers should question whether
the seller is the most efficient producer willing to accept lower margins to win mar-
ket share, or is the real intention to drive competition from the marketplace and later
raise prices to exorbitant levels?
</p>
<p>Market Skimming Model
In the market skimming model, prices are set to achieve a high profit on each
</p>
<p>unit by selling to supply managers who are willing to pay a higher price because of a
lack of purchasing sophistication or who are willing to pay for products or services
of perceived higher value. An example of the application of this model is frequently
seen by supply managers in the use of backdoor selling to non-purchasing profes-
sionals in the firm. Supply managers should always seek to reduce the potential nega-
tive impact of this pricing model by cost, price, or value analysis to ensure that the
higher price for the product or service is justified by the reported additional benefits.
A good example of this situation is shown in Sourcing Snapshot: Higher Pipeline
Costs Forecast, where the pipeline engineering industry is faced by so much demand
for projects that it is literally in a supplier&rsquo;s market and can charge higher-than-
normal prices for their services.
</p>
<p>Revenue Pricing Model
When downturns in market demand occur, suppliers often must resort to a cur-
</p>
<p>rent revenue pricing model. The emphasis of this model is on obtaining sufficient cur-
rent revenue to pay for operating cost rather than on profit. Suppliers using this
strategy are typically concerned about capacity utilization, covering fixed costs, and re-
taining skilled labor during market slowdowns, when they are willing to reduce their
prices until market conditions change. However, supply managers should be on
guard for negative impacts on quality and service resulting from cost cutting on the
part of the supplier.
</p>
<p>Promotional Pricing Model
The promotional pricing model presents pricing for individual products and ser-
</p>
<p>vices that is set to enhance the sales of the overall product line rather than to ensure
the profitability of each product. Current examples of this are the sale of cell phones
at below cost in order to induce consumers to buy the annual service contract, or the
use of extremely low prices for printers that require the use of the supplier&rsquo;s highly
</p>
<p>refining capacity and 32 million tonnes per annum of petrochemical plants, under develop-
ment in the region. This is also drawing on this labor pool.

<p>profitable ink cartridges. Total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis (discussed later in
the chapter) should be used to avoid surprising and unfavorable financial impacts
that can result from dealings with suppliers using this model.
</p>
<p>Competition Pricing Model
The competition pricing model focuses on pricing actions or reactions to pricing
</p>
<p>proposals offered or expected to be offered by the supplier&rsquo;s competitors. The pricing
strategy is based on determining the highest price that can be offered to the supply
manager that will still be lower than the price offered by competitors. An excellent ex-
ample of this model is the reverse auction process.
</p>
<p>Cash Discounts
The practice in most industries is to offer incentives to pay invoices promptly.
</p>
<p>One way to encourage this is to offer cash discounts for payment within a certain pe-
riod of time. For example, a seller may offer a discount of 2% for invoice payment
within 10 days of receipt. The seller usually expects full payment within 30 days.
(This is often expressed as &ldquo;2% 10/net 30.&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>Unlike quantity discounts, it is usually worthwhile to take advantage of cash dis-
counts. Purchasers can rarely earn the equivalent return within a 10-day period of
transactions offered with a cash discount. The opportunity cost of not taking the dis-
count is almost always higher than the opportunity cost of taking the discount. Well-
managed firms take advantage of cash discounts and arrange payment within the spec-
ified time frame.
</p>
<p>Understanding the pricing model used by suppliers can provide supply managers
with significant insights into the strategies needed to generate cost savings for their firm.
</p>
<p>Using the Producer Price Index to Manage Price
As noted earlier, price analysis is appropriate for certain types of commodities. Spe-
</p>
<p>cifically, monitoring price instead of cost is appropriate for market-based products
where pricing is largely a function of supply and demand. Examples include steel, pa-
per, plastic, and other types of bulk commodities. When assessing whether the price
charged is fair compared with the market, managers can compare price changes for a
purchase family to an external index. An important factor when conducting a price
analysis is the Producer Price Index (PPI), which is maintained by the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
</p>
<p>This information can easily be downloaded from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
web page (www.bls.gov). The index tracks material price movements from quarter to
quarter. It is scaled to a base year (1988) and tracks the percentage increase in mate-
rial commodity prices based on a sample of industrial purchasers. By converting
price increases paid from quarter to quarter into a percentage increase, and compar-
ing the changes to the PPI for a similar type of material, the purchaser can deter-
mine whether the price increases paid to the supplier of that material are reasonable.
</p>
<p>To use this tool, users will first need to identify the supplier&rsquo;s standard industrial
code (SIC). This can be found at www.FreeEDGAR.com. Next, look at the price in-
dex for the SIC and product that you are interested in. Consider the following exam-
ple for iron castings. The PPI for iron castings is shown in Exhibit 11.7.

<p>Price paid to supplier on March 30, 2008: $52.50/unit
</p>
<p>Price paid to supplier on June 30, 2008: $53.20/unit
</p>
<p>Percentage price increase = ($53.20 &minus; $52.50)/$52.50 = 1.33%
</p>
<p>Steel castings PPI (March 30, 2008) = 127.2
</p>
<p>Steel castings PPI (June 30, 2008) = 127.5
</p>
<p>Percentage inflation for steel castings = (127.5 &minus; 127.2)/127.2 = 0.2%
</p>
<p>In this case, the price increase paid by the purchaser is over five times as much as
the increase in the PPI for iron castings&mdash;surely an unreasonable increase! The pur-
chaser should definitely question the supplier about this recent price increase, and ne-
gotiate a better price!
</p>
<p>In addition to PPI data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics website also contains infor-
mation on labor rates in different regions of the country, and updates on pricing and
market conditions. Information on employment cost data is also available in Purchas-
ing magazine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Buying Strategy Forecast,&rdquo; a semimonthly newsletter, and the Direct-
ICE report prepared by Thinking Cap Solutions (www.ice-alert.com). Other sources
of commodity price information are the &ldquo;Pink Sheets&rdquo; published by the World Bank
(www.worldbank.org/prospects).
</p>
<p>Some companies set an objective of consistently bettering price inflation with sup-
pliers. That is, they expect that performance should be better than the market.
</p>
<p>As shown in Exhibit 11.8, this can provide the company with a relative competi-
tive advantage in terms of pricing. Caution should be used when applying PPI data
that match the commodity being purchased. The buyer should carefully study the his-
tory of the index to ensure that it has a strong correlation with the price history of
the commodity being purchased. Several questions should be asked in this situation:

<p>&bull; How did the purchasing situation affect the price fairness and reasonable-
ness at the time?
</p>
<p>&bull; How have conditions (e.g., delivery requirements) changed?
</p>
<p>&bull; What is the effect on price of changes in the quantity of a material or ser-
vice purchased?
</p>
<p>&bull; Was the purchasing situation a sole source or competitive source?
</p>
<p>&bull; Are the index comparisons driving purchasing strategies?
</p>
<p>A real benefit of using this price analysis approach is to track price changes across dif-
ferent commodities and compare performance. For example, consider the following.
</p>
<p>Three sourcing teams are discussing their cost results for the past year:
</p>
<p>Gasoline team: 15% cost increase
</p>
<p>Lumber team: 10% cost increase
</p>
<p>Paper team: 2% cost increase
</p>
<p>Which team has been most effective at managing costs for the year?
</p>
<p>At first glance, it would appear that the paper team is doing the best because they
have the lowest cost increases (2%). However, in comparing the results with the PPI
data shown in Exhibit 11.9, the picture is markedly different. The lumber team has
failed to capture savings in a market that has seen prices increase by only 8.6%, while
the paper team has limited price increases to 2%, which is only par for the course in
terms of what is happening in the market. The gasoline team, however, has been able
to contain price increases to 15% in the face of a market that has seen gas prices
increase by more than 21%, largely due to speculation associated with the Iraq war
during this period. This analysis can help identify different price changes in markets
where a fair and open market is present.
</p>
<p>Cost Analysis Techniques
As noted earlier, more and more organizations are shifting their attention away
</p>
<p>from price management and toward cost management. In so doing, there may be op-
portunities to reduce costs that are not available when the discussion focuses only on
price. In cost analysis, the supply manager performs a detailed analysis of the differ-
ent elements of costs shown earlier in Exhibit 11.6 and identifies what is driving the
different elements.

<p>Cost-Based Pricing Models4
</p>
<p>Cost Markup Pricing Model
In this model, the supplier simply takes its estimate of costs and adds a markup
</p>
<p>percentage to obtain the desired profit. This markup percentage could be added to
the product cost only (usually direct materials plus direct labor plus production over-
head), in which case the markup would have to provide for profit, plus all other indi-
rect costs of operating the business. However, if the markup is applied to the total
cost (product cost plus general, administrative, and sales expenses), then the markup
is solely profit to the supplier. For example, a supplier that wanted a 20% markup
over its total cost of $50 would quote a price of $60 ($50 + (20% of $50) = $60),
which would leave a profit of $10.
</p>
<p>Margin Pricing Model
In the margin pricing model, the supplier is still attempting to obtain a profit re-
</p>
<p>lated to its costs, but instead of adding a markup to cost, the supplier establishes a
price that will provide a profit margin that is a predetermined percentage of the
quoted price (i.e., not a percentage of cost, as in markup pricing). For example, the
supplier discovered that last year its margin as a percentage of sales was 1%, and this
year the supplier would like it to be 20%. Using the same total cost of $50 as above
would result in the supplier quoting a price of $62.50 in order to obtain the margin
of 20%. This is calculated using the new equation for margin pricing:
</p>
<p>Cost &thorn; &eth;Margin Rate � Unit Selling Price&THORN; &frac14; Unit Selling Price
Using simple algebra, solving the equation for unit selling price results in the
</p>
<p>formula:
</p>
<p>Cost=&eth;1 &minus; Margin Rate&THORN; &frac14; Unit Selling Price
or
</p>
<p>&eth;$50&THORN;=&eth;1 &minus; 20%&THORN; &frac14; $62.50
As in cost markup pricing, the supply manager must be aware if the margin pric-
</p>
<p>ing is based on product cost only or if it&rsquo;s based on total cost.
</p>
<p>Rate-of-Return Pricing Model
A third common model in the cost-based category is the rate-of-return pricing
</p>
<p>model, wherein the desired profit is added to the estimated cost. In this model, the
supplier bases the profit on the objective of a specific desired return on the financial
investment, rather than on the estimated cost. For example, if the supplier wanted a
20% return on its investment of $300,000 (which might include R&amp;D, equipment, en-
gineering, or other elements), to make 4,000 parts with a total cost of $50 each, the
quoted price would be $65, using the following approach:
</p>
<p>Unit Cost &thorn; Unit Profit &frac14; Unit Selling Price
$50 &thorn; &eth;&eth;20% � 300,000&THORN;=4,000&THORN; &frac14; $65
</p>
<p>Product Specifications
Whether they realize it or not, purchasers impact price at the time they set the spec-
</p>
<p>ifications for the product or service. Specifying products or services requiring custom
design and tooling affects a seller&rsquo;s price, which is one of the reasons purchasers try

<p>to specify industry-standard parts whenever possible. Cost (and hence price) becomes
higher as firms increase the value-added requirements for an item through design, tool-
ing, or engineering requirements. Purchasers should specify industry-accepted standard
parts for as much of their component requirements as possible and rely on customized
items when they provide a competitive product advantage or help differentiate a prod-
uct in the marketplace.
</p>
<p>The ability to perform a cost analysis is a direct function of the quality and avail-
ability of information. If a purchaser and seller maintain a distant relationship, cost
data will be more difficult to identify due to the lack of support from the seller. An ob-
vious approach that can help in obtaining necessary cost data is to require a detailed
production cost breakdown when a seller submits a purchase quotation. The reliabil-
ity of self-reported cost data must be considered. Another approach or option in-
volves the joint sharing of cost information. A cross-functional team composed of
engineers and manufacturing personnel from both companies may meet to identify
potential areas of the supplier&rsquo;s process (or the purchaser&rsquo;s requirements) that can po-
tentially reduce costs. One of the benefits of developing closer relations with key sup-
pliers is the increased visibility of supplier cost data. The following section details
some techniques that focus on cost.
</p>
<p>Estimating Supplier Costs Using Reverse Price Analysis
Often suppliers will not be forthcoming in sharing cost data. In these situations,
</p>
<p>the purchaser must resort to a different type of analytical approach called &ldquo;reverse
price analysis&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;should cost&rdquo; analysis). A seller&rsquo;s cost structure affects
price because, in the long run, the seller must price at a level that covers all variable
costs of production, contributes to some portion of fixed costs, and contributes to
some level of profit. As discussed later in the chapter, many suppliers are reluctant to
share internal cost information. This information, however, is valuable to a pur-
chaser, particularly when evaluating whether a supplier&rsquo;s price is justifiable and rea-
sonable. In the absence of specific cost data, a supplier&rsquo;s overall cost structure must
be estimated using a cost analysis&mdash;meaning that if the supplier is assigning costs in
an appropriate manner, what should the product cost based on these calculations?
</p>
<p>Information about a specific product or product line is often difficult to identify.
A purchaser may have to use internal engineering estimates about what it costs to pro-
duce an item, rely on historical experience and judgment to estimate costs, or review
public financial documents to identify key cost data about the seller. The latter ap-
proach works best with publicly traded small suppliers producing limited product
lines. Financial documents allow estimation of a supplier&rsquo;s overall cost structure. The
drawback is that these documents do not provide much information about a specific
breakdown of cost by product or product line. Also, if a supplier is a privately held
company, cost data become difficult to obtain or estimate.
</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, there are tools available that can be used to estimate a
supplier&rsquo;s cost using some publicly available information. When evaluating a suppli-
er&rsquo;s costs, the major determinants of a supplier&rsquo;s total cost structure must be taken
into consideration. Let&rsquo;s assume a purchasing manager is buying a product or service
for the first time without experience of what fair pricing might be. Because they
don&rsquo;t have the tools at hand, or because they&rsquo;re too busy, many purchasers&rsquo; usual tech-
nique is to go with their gut feel or to evaluate competitive bids. It may be worth the
time and effort, however, to perform some additional research using data from an in-
come statement or from Internet sites. In doing so, the purchaser may perform a

<p>reverse price analysis&mdash;which essentially means breaking down the price into its com-
ponents of material, labor, overhead, and profit.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start the process with a supplier-provided price of $20 per unit. The first com-
ponent to consider is the price contribution toward profit, and sales, general, and ad-
ministrative (SGA) expenses. For publicly traded companies, this can be estimated by
looking at a variety of websites that provide information on financial reports, includ-
ing balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, and annual reports
shown in Exhibit 11.10 under the &ldquo;Financial Reports&rdquo; section.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 11.10 provides a list of available data sources for other components of
cost. For this example, assume the purchaser determined that the supplier is a pri-
vately held company. This is still not a problem, assuming the buyer can look up the
supplier&rsquo;s SIC code (www.FreeEDGAR.com). Another useful resource is Robert Mor-
ris Association (www.rmahq.org), which publishes the gross profit margin for this
SIC overall, as well as before-tax profit percentages. Although this is a rough esti-
mate, it does offer a good starting point. In Exhibit 11.11, the gross profit and SGA ex-
pense percentage for this supplier&rsquo;s SIC code is 15%. Thus on a price of $20 the
estimated profit is $3. Next, the purchaser will need to understand the labor and mate-
rial cost components of price.
</p>
<p>Material costs can often be estimated by consulting with internal engineers. Using
an estimate of required material, as well as external information on current pricing
of these materials (as shown in the previous section), a rough estimate can be made
of the amount of material in the product. In our example, we discovered that an ap-
proximation of the amount of material included is 20% of the price, or $4.
</p>
<p>To find out how much labor is included, the best place to look is the Annual Sur-
vey of Manufacturers, published by the U.S. Department of Commerce and available

<p>at www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/industry.html. This site allows the purchaser to
download information on total direct-labor costs and total material costs for any SIC
number. This information allows the purchaser to calculate a materials-to-labor ratio.
For the analysis shown in Exhibit 11.11, suppose that the purchaser discovered that
the ratio of materials to labor based on the SIC code was 1.333. Thus, if material
costs were previously estimated at $4, then direct-labor costs should be approxi-
mately $3 (4/1.333).
</p>
<p>After subtracting the estimates for profit/SGA, materials, and labor from the price,
the remaining portion of cost is considered manufacturing burden or overhead. At
this point, the purchaser must determine whether $10 per unit paid on a price of $20
per unit is a reasonable amount for overhead costs. Typically, overhead is expressed
as a percentage of labor costs. For labor-intensive industries, the ratio could be as
low as 150%. For capital-intensive industries, it could be as high as 600%. In our ex-
ample, the overhead rate is 333% of labor ($10/$3). Using other data from Robert
Morris Associates, the purchaser can also estimate the percentages for operating ex-
penses and for all other expenses. With this cost estimate in hand, the purchaser
should now be able to approach the supplier in a negotiation and initiate a discus-
sion that addresses price and cost. Although these estimates may not be 100% accu-
rate, they provide a baseline for discussion of the supplier&rsquo;s cost structure.
</p>
<p>Labor cost will be an increasing factor in many cost estimates. The period from
2007 to 2015 will see the next impact of the baby boomer population on society.
This impact will be in terms of a large number of people from this group retiring
and leaving the work force. The number of retirees from multiple industries is ex-
pected to reach levels that have never been seen previously.
</p>
<p>At the same time, the U.S. economy will continue to grow, and the demand for la-
bor will escalate proportionately. Given the movement toward the service economy,
the need for labor in selected industries is expected to grow significantly. Experts be-
lieve that services will be most affected, with a 29% growth rate. Transportation, re-
tail trade, construction, and wholesale trade labor demand will also increase by
double digits during this period. In construction alone, demand for drilling, specialty
trades, and refining positions will increase by 17 to 18% during this period.
</p>
<p>In discussing the supplier&rsquo;s cost structure with the supplier and how it applies to
the price paid, the purchaser should attempt to initiate discussion in the following
areas to discover opportunities for cost reductions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Plant utilization. The cost impact of additional business on the operating effi-
ciency of a supplier should be evaluated. Is a supplier currently operating at
capacity? Will additional volume actually create higher costs through

<p>overtime? Or will a supplier be able to reduce its cost structure through addi-
tional volume? The utilization rate of productive assets contributes directly
to a supplier&rsquo;s cost structure.
</p>
<p>&bull; Process capability. The purchaser should also consider if projected volume re-
quirements match a supplier&rsquo;s process capability. It may be inefficient to
source smaller lot sizes with a supplier that requires long runs to minimize
costs. On the other hand, suppliers specializing in smaller batches cannot effi-
ciently accommodate volumes requiring longer production runs. A supplier&rsquo;s
production processes should match a purchaser&rsquo;s production requirements.
Purchasing should also evaluate production processes to determine if they
are state-of-the-art or rely on outdated technology. Production and process
capability influences operating efficiencies, quality, and the overall cost struc-
ture of a seller.
</p>
<p>&bull; Learning-curve effect. Learning-curve analysis indicates whether a seller can
lower its cost as a result of the repetitive production of an item.
</p>
<p>&bull; The supplier&rsquo;s workforce. A supplier&rsquo;s labor force affects the cost structure. Is-
sues such as unionized versus nonunionized, motivated versus unmotivated,
and the quality awareness and commitment of employees all combine to
add another component to the cost structure. When visiting a supplier&rsquo;s facil-
ity, representatives from the purchaser should take the time to talk with em-
ployees about quality and other work-related items. Meeting with employees
provides valuable insight about a supplier&rsquo;s operation. In recent years, the
cost of labor in the workforce has gone up dramatically (see Sourcing Snap-
shot: The Rising Cost of Welders).
</p>
<p>&bull; Management capability. Management affects costs by directing the work-
force in the most efficient manner, committing resources for longer-term
productivity improvements, defining a firm&rsquo;s quality requirements, manag-
ing technology, and assigning financial resources in an optimal manner.
Management efficiency and capability have both a tangible and intangible im-
pact on a firm&rsquo;s cost structure. In the end, every cost component is a direct
result of management action taken at some point in time.
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchasing efficiency. How well suppliers purchase their goods and services
has a direct impact on purchase price. Suppliers face many of the same un-
certainties and forces in their supply markets that purchasers face. Supplier
visits and evaluations should evaluate the tools and techniques suppliers use
to meet their material requirements.
</p>
<p>Break-Even Analysis
Break-even analysis includes both cost and revenue data for an item to identify
</p>
<p>the point where revenue equals cost, and the expected profit or loss at different pro-
duction volumes.
</p>
<p>Firms perform break-even analysis at different organizational levels. At the highest
levels, top management uses this technique as a strategic planning tool. For example,
an automobile manufacturer can use the tool to estimate expected profit or loss over
a range of automobile sales. If the analysis indicates that the break-even point in
units has risen over previous estimates, cost-cutting strategies can be put in place. Di-
visions or business units can use the technique to estimate the break-even point for a
new product line.

<p>The Rising Cost
of Welders
</p>
<p>There is a chronic shortage of young people who are seeking a career in welding or as
electricians, boilermakers, pipefitters, or other trade-school craft labor positions. Let&rsquo;s focus
for a moment on welders as a case study that is representative of this problem. With esti-
mates that nearly half of the skilled welders available today are nearing retirement, the re-
cruitment of younger people into the welding industry has become an important issue. The
American Welding Society (AWS) has estimated that there will be a shortage of more than
200,000 skilled welders by 2010 in the United States, and the U.S. Department of Labor re-
ports that the number of welders employed in the United States declined about 10% to
576,000 in 2005&mdash;the last full year for which data is available&mdash;from 594,000 in 2000.5
</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the welding industry&rsquo;s biggest challenges is attracting young talent, which is attribut-
able in large part to its tarnished image,&rdquo; said Dennis Klingman, AWS Education Committee
chairman. &ldquo;Many people still associate welding with black-and-white photos of tired welders
covered in scuffmarks and dressed in soiled clothing. But the welding industry has under-
gone dramatic changes with the advancement of technology, and is no longer confined to
the dark and dirty setting reminiscent of the last century&rsquo;s industrial era. Despite this, there
continues to be an image problem, and parents, instructors, and counselors have been hesi-
tant to introduce students to the industry.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In a recent interview, an expert noted the following:
</p>
<p>We need to reach out to 17 and 18 year olds, who currently don&rsquo;t understand
that you can do very well in these roles. The skilled labor part of the world&mdash;en-
gineers, mechanics, and electricians&mdash;in building our infrastructure&mdash;will cause
us to struggle, when people are leaving the workforce. In some of these trades
this is a narrow window. You can only be a productive welder for 15&ndash;20 years,
and it is hard work, dirty work. What are the demographics for welders? I would
suspect that most last until they are 30&ndash;40 and most don&rsquo;t do it into their 50s.
It is backbreaking labor. We are going to be in for an eye-opening experience.
</p>
<p>There has also been a huge draw on the demand for new infrastructure. The nation&rsquo;s infra-
structure has not been upgraded in a very long time. In addition, there are multiple geographi-
cal areas undergoing significant development, which will put additional pressure on demand
for labor.

<p>&bull; Prepare for negotiation. Break-even analysis allows a purchaser to anticipate
a seller&rsquo;s pricing strategy during negotiations. Research indicates that a di-
rect relationship exists between preparation and negotiating effectiveness.
</p>
<p>Break-even analysis requires the purchaser to identify the important costs and rev-
enues associated with a product or product line. Graphing the data presents a visual
representation of the expected loss or profit at various production levels. Cost equa-
tions also express the expected relationship between cost, volume, and profit. When
using break-even analysis, certain common assumptions are typically used:6
</p>
<p>1. Fixed costs remain constant over the period and volumes considered.
</p>
<p>2. Variable costs fluctuate in a linear fashion, although this may not always be
the case.
</p>
<p>3. Revenues vary directly with volume. This is represented graphically by an
upward-sloping total revenue line beginning at the origin.
</p>
<p>4. The fixed and variable costs include the semivariable costs. Thus no semivari-
able cost line exists.
</p>
<p>5. Break-even analysis considers total costs rather than average costs. However,
the technique often uses the average selling price for an item to calculate the
total revenue line.
</p>
<p>6. Significant joint (i.e., shared) costs among departments or products limits the
use of this technique if these costs cannot be reasonably apportioned among
users. If shared costs cannot be apportioned, then break-even analysis is best
suited for the entire operation versus individual departments, products, or
product lines.
</p>
<p>7. This technique considers only quantitative factors. If qualitative factors are im-
portant, management must consider these before making any decisions based
on the break-even analysis.
</p>
<p>Break-Even Analysis Example
The following example assumes that fixed costs, variable costs, and target pur-
</p>
<p>chase price for a single item are reasonably accurate. The construction of a break-
even graph requires these three pieces of information.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 11.12 shows the required cost and volume data along with the break-even
graph for this example. Because a buyer is estimating the break-even analysis for a
supplier, the price is a target purchase price established by the purchaser. A range of
prices can be analyzed to estimate a supplier&rsquo;s expected profit or loss given the fixed
and variable costs.
</p>
<p>In this example, the purchaser wants to determine if the anticipated volume of
9,000 units provides an adequate profit for the supplier at the target purchase price.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 11.12 indicates that the supplier requires at least 7,500 units to avoid a
loss with this cost structure and target purchase price. The following equation identi-
fies the profit or loss associated with a given volume:
</p>
<p>Net Income or Loss &frac14; &eth;P&THORN;&eth;X&THORN; � &eth;VC&THORN;&eth;X&THORN; � &eth;FC&THORN;
where P = average purchase price, X = units produced, VC = variable cost per unit
of production, and FC = fixed cost of production for an item.

<p>406 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The supplier&rsquo;s expected profit for the anticipated 9,000 units is calculated as fol-
lows, using $10 per unit as the average purchase price:
</p>
<p>Net Income &frac14; &eth;$10&THORN;&eth;9,000&THORN; � &eth;$6&THORN;&eth;9,000&THORN; � &eth;$30,000&THORN;
&frac14; $60,000 Profit
</p>
<p>We can also calculate the number of units the supplier needs to produce to break
even (i.e., cover fixed costs). This is calculated as follows:
</p>
<p>Total Revenue &frac14; Variable Cost&thorn; Fixed Cost
$10&eth;X&THORN; &frac14; $6&eth;X&THORN; &thorn; $30,000
$4&eth;X&THORN; &frac14; $30,000
</p>
<p>X &frac14; 75,000 units
If the cost data are accurate, then the anticipated purchase volume provides a
</p>
<p>profit to the supplier, because it exceeds 7,500 units. Whether this is an acceptable
profit level given the cost structure is an issue both parties may have to negotiate. If
the analysis indicates that the purchase volume results in an expected loss to the
seller, then a purchaser must consider several important questions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Is the target purchase price too optimistic given the supplier&rsquo;s cost
structure?

<p>&bull; Are the supplier&rsquo;s production costs reasonable compared with other pro-
ducers in the industry?
</p>
<p>&bull; Are the cost and volume estimates accurate?
</p>
<p>&bull; If the cost, volume, and target price are reasonable, is this the right supplier
to produce this item?
</p>
<p>&bull; Will direct assistance help reduce costs at the supplier?
</p>
<p>This method allows an evaluation of a supplier&rsquo;s expected profit over a range of
costs, volumes, and target purchase prices. The break-even technique, however, often
provides only broad insight into a purchase decision.
</p>
<p>Total Cost of Ownership
Total cost of ownership requires a purchaser to identify and measure costs beyond
</p>
<p>the standard unit price, transportation, and tooling when evaluating purchase propo-
sals or supplier performance. Formally, total cost of ownership is defined as the present
value of all costs associated with a product, service, or capital equipment that are in-
curred over its expected life.
</p>
<p>Most large firms base purchase decisions and evaluate suppliers on cost elements
beyond unit price, transportation, and tooling. Research indicates, however, that com-
panies differ widely about what cost components to include in a total cost analysis.
</p>
<p>Typically these costs can be broken into four broad categories:7
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchase price. The amount paid to the supplier for the product, service, or
capital equipment.
</p>
<p>&bull; Acquisition costs. All costs associated with bringing the product, service, or
capital equipment to the customer&rsquo;s location. Examples of acquisition costs
are sourcing, administration, freight, and taxes.
</p>
<p>&bull; Usage costs. In the case of a product, all costs associated with converting the
purchased part/material into the finished product and supporting it through
its usable life. In the case of a service, all costs associated with the perfor-
mance of the service that are not included in the purchase price. In the case
of capital equipment, all costs associated with operating the equipment
through its life. Examples of usage costs are inventory, conversion, scrap,
warranty, installation, training, downtime, and opportunity costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; End-of-life costs. All costs incurred when a product, service, or capital equip-
ment reaches the end of its usable life, net of amounts received from the
sale of remaining product or the equipment (salvage value) as the case may
be. Examples of end-of-life costs are obsolescence, disposal, clean-up, and
project termination costs.
</p>
<p>Building a Total Cost of Ownership Model
Building a TCO model is not an easy task. It requires input from different parts
</p>
<p>of the organization and a thorough understanding of the process through the entire
life cycle. The following steps must be taken to ensure that all costs are captured
correctly:

<p>408 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Step 1. Map the process and develop TCO categories. Construct a process map
from the time a need for the product, service, or capital equipment is identi-
fied all the way through the life cycle. The activities that you identify will help
to develop broad TCO categories.
</p>
<p>Step 2. Determine cost elements for each category. Using the process map as a
guide, identify the subcost elements that make up each TCO category.
</p>
<p>Step 3. Determine how each cost element is to be measured. This is a critical
step. The metrics must be determined to quantify each of the cost elements
identified in Step 2. For example, to quantify the costs of sourcing labor, the
hourly rate of the individuals performing the sourcing activity and the amount
of time they spend or will spend doing it will need to be known.
</p>
<p>Step 4. Gather data and quantify costs. This is the most difficult and time-
consuming step. In this step gather data for each of the metrics identified in
Step 3 and quantify the respective costs. This requires information from vari-
ous sources including interviews, surveys, the A/P system, and other internal
databases. If information from internal databases is used, make sure to vali-
date the numbers. Input errors can sometimes cause the numbers generated
by these databases to be significantly inaccurate.
</p>
<p>Step 5. Develop a cost timeline. Construct a cost timeline for the length of the
life cycle. Place each cost element quantified in Step 4 in the appropriate time pe-
riod. Then calculate totals for each time period as shown in the example.
</p>
<p>Step 6. Bring costs to present value. Computing the present value allows deci-
sions to be made based on present dollars. This is important because a dollar
spent one year from now is not worth the same as a dollar spent now. The
value of money spent anytime in the future will depend on the organization&rsquo;s
cost of capital. To calculate the present value, therefore, obtain the organiza-
tion&rsquo;s cost of capital from its finance department. Then calculate the present
value of each total in the cost time line by using a present value table or a finan-
cial calculator. The sum of present values for each time period represents the
total cost of ownership.
</p>
<p>The Importance of Opportunity Costs
When considering usage costs, make sure to identify opportunity costs, if any. An
</p>
<p>opportunity cost is defined as the cost of the next best alternative. Typical opportunity
costs include lost sales, lost productivity, and downtime. The absence of these costs
in an analysis could lead to an entirely different decision and, possibly, a wrong one,
as illustrated below.
</p>
<p>A supply manager looking to purchase a machine was evaluating two alternatives.
Alternative A was priced at $100,000, and B was priced at $125,000. The delivery
lead time for Machine A was 90 days, and Machine B was 30 days. When determin-
ing usage costs for A it was important to add the lost revenue that would have been
generated during the 60 days (90 &minus; 30 = 60) had machine B been installed. By includ-
ing the cost of lost revenue, B became the better alternative even though it was
priced higher.
</p>
<p>In another case, a supply manager made the decision, based primarily on price, to
purchase Machine Y instead of Machine X. His analysis, however, omitted the oppor-
tunity cost from the difference in production capacity between the two machines. Ma-
chine X was capable of producing 10% more units than Machine Y. In a market

<p>Maytag Sources Globally
to Compete
</p>
<p>Maytag dishwashers have Chinese motors and Mexican wiring, and are put together in
a sprawling American factory in Jackson, Tennessee. Some refer to this three-tiered approach
to manufacturing as a triad strategy. Maytag calls it trying to keep ahead of imports. For a
long time, bulky appliances like washing machines and refrigerators largely were insulated
from competition with cheap imports because of their cavernous size. &ldquo;Big boxes of air are ex-
pensive to ship across the ocean,&rdquo; says Maytag Corp.&rsquo;s Jim Starkweather.
</p>
<p>Over time, though, sharply lower labor and production costs in Asia have offset high freight
costs, enabling some imported appliances (such as China&rsquo;s Haier and Korea&rsquo;s LG Electron-
ics) to be sold in the United States at lower prices. With the arrival of low-priced imports,
Maytag had to radically rethink how and where it builds refrigerators, washing machines,
and dishwashers; it found the triad strategy works best for now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a logical progression
for us,&rdquo; says Art Learmonth, senior vice president of supply chain, noting that Maytag wants
to avoid a wholesale shift of production out of the United States. The company says it wants
to stay as close as possible to its end market and avoid shedding American jobs wherever
possible.
</p>
<p>In the case of dishwashers, Maytag buys motors in China&mdash;from a plant owned by GE&mdash;
because the design is standardized and stable and China offers the lowest price. Maytag
makes wire harnesses for dishwashers in Mexico because those harnesses tend to be differ-
ent in each dishwasher model, so sudden shifts in demand could make it difficult to supply
from farther away. How was this decision made? By &ldquo;dissecting&rdquo; competitors&rsquo; appliances to
determine the cost of every component. Whenever a competitor introduces a new dishwasher,
for example, Maytag buys one and brings it to Jackson to dismantle it. Engineers examine ri-
val appliances&rsquo; O-rings, steel tubes, and other elements and estimate what it costs to make
the appliance in the United States&mdash;and what it would cost to make it in Mexico.
</p>
<p>Not everything goes away permanently, though. Subassembly work for dishwashers, essen-
tially putting pumps and motors together in one piece with cables and connectors, was done
in Reynosa, Mexico, and shipped to Tennessee. But eventually it grew more cost-effective to
do the work in Tennessee: A simpler design was introduced, reducing labor, and it used
less-expensive motors from China rather than Mexico. Still, Maytag says it wouldn&rsquo;t build cer-
tain items in China. Maytag teamed with a German supplier to develop a &ldquo;turbidity sensor&rdquo;
that scans water coming out of a dishwasher to determine how clean the dishes are. As
long as it detects the tiniest bit of food, the dishes are deemed dirty and the machine keeps
churning. Learmonth says the company wouldn&rsquo;t try to have the sensors built in China, be-
cause the Chinese &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t as protective of new technology&rdquo; and so such proprietary technol-
ogy is at greater risk of being stolen.
</p>
<p>In some cases, though, Maytag decides it simply can&rsquo;t compete with imports. For example,
profit margins on refrigerators with the freezer on top, rather than alongside or on the bot-
tom, were so measly due to cheap imports that Maytag decided to quit making them. In-
stead, it pays Daewoo Electronics in Korea to produce those models and ship them to the
United States to be sold under the Maytag name.

<p>upswing, sales potential increased by 10%. Machine Y was unable to handle the in-
crease and a new machine had to be purchased. Had the supply manager selected Ma-
chine X, the purchase of a new machine could have been deferred, thereby saving
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mistakes like this can easily be avoided by ensur-
ing that all costs, especially opportunity costs, are captured in the TCO.
</p>
<p>Important Factors to Consider When Building
a TCO Model
</p>
<p>&bull; Building a TCO can be a costly and time-intensive activity. Use it for evaluat-
ing larger purchases.
</p>
<p>&bull; Make sure to obtain senior management buy-in before embarking on a full-
fledged TCO. It will make data gathering much easier, especially if several
people from different parts of the organization have to be interviewed.
</p>
<p>&bull; Work in a team. This will greatly reduce the time required for data collec-
tion activities, which can be distributed among team members.
</p>
<p>&bull; Focus on the big costs first. Spending extended periods of time quantifying
small cost elements will only delay the decision, which in most cases will
not be impacted by them.
</p>
<p>&bull; Make sure to obtain a realistic estimate of the life cycle. A life cycle that is
too short or too long could result in a wrong decision.
</p>
<p>&bull; Whether evaluating a purchase option or making an outsourcing decision, a
TCO model will ensure that the right decision is made, at least from a cost
perspective.

logistics, and import costs associated with the total supply chain. A good
example of this model in action is shown in Sourcing Snapshot: Maytag
Sources Globally to Compete.
</p>
<p>Example of a TCO Model
Supply manager Joe Smith was considering the purchase of 1,000 desktop PCs for
</p>
<p>his organization. The life cycle was 3 years and the organization&rsquo;s cost of capital was
12%. He calculated the TCO for one of the purchase options as shown in Exhibit
11.13 on p. 411.
</p>
<p>Using these elements, the total cost of ownership for each of these decisions was
calculated as shown in Exhibit 11.14.
</p>
<p>On the basis of this model, the supply manager should explore the possibilities of
reducing service costs such as equipment support and network support&mdash;these ap-
pear to be the highest value, and contribute most to costs. This is also typically the
most profitable area for the supplier, as services are often not audited.

way to reduce costs for strategic commodities is not through price haggling, but

<p>through effective collaboration. When supply management, engineering, and suppli-
ers put their heads together to find innovative ways to reduce costs, the outcome is
generally mutually beneficial for both parties: The buying company gets a lower
price, and in many cases, the supplier benefits from a higher margin and a guarantee
of future business. Two of the most common approaches to collaborative cost manage-
ment include target pricing and cost-savings sharing.
</p>
<p>Target Pricing Defined
Target pricing is an innovative approach used in the initial stages of the new-prod-
</p>
<p>uct development (NPD) cycle to establish a contract price between a buyer and
seller. Japanese manufacturers, in an effort to motivate engineers to select designs
that could be produced at a low cost, originally developed target pricing methodolo-
gies during the 1980s to battle the rising yen versus the U.S. dollar. These innovators
came up with a simple concept to apply in new-product development: The cost of a
new product is no longer an outcome of the product design process; rather, it is an in-
put to the process. The challenge is to design a product with the required functional-
ity and quality at a cost that provides a reasonable profit. In a new car, for example,
the development team may work with marketing to determine the target price of the
vehicle for the product&rsquo;s market segment. Using final price as a basis, the product is
disaggregated into major systems, such as the engine and powertrain. Each major sys-
tem has a target cost. At the component level (which represents a further disaggre-
gation from the system level), the target cost is the price that a purchaser hopes to
attain from a supplier (if the item is externally sourced).
</p>
<p>With target pricing, a product&rsquo;s allowable cost is strictly a function of what a mar-
ket segment is willing to pay less the profit goals for the product. Under traditional
pricing approaches, however, product cost + profit = selling price. Using a target pric-
ing approach, the selling price &minus; profit = the allowable product cost. Generally speak-
ing, the target cost is not always achievable by the supplier in early negotiations.
Moreover, the supplier&rsquo;s current price to provide a product or service today is proba-
bly greater than the target price set forth by the buying company.
</p>
<p>The difference between the supplier&rsquo;s price and the target cost becomes the strategic
cost-reduction objective. This gap must be reduced by both parties in a collaborative ef-
fort through such methods as value engineering, quality function deployment, design
for manufacturing/assembly, and standardization. Setting product-level target costs
that are too aggressive may result in unachievable target costs. Setting too low a strate-
gic cost-reduction challenge leads to easily achieved target costs but a loss of competi-
tive position. In setting target prices and target costs, the new-product development
team should bear in mind the cardinal rule of target costing: The target cost can never
be violated. Moreover, even if engineers find a way to improve the functionality of the
product, they cannot make the improvement unless they can offset the additional cost.
</p>
<p>One of the pioneers and industry leaders in target pricing is Honda of America
Manufacturing. The company breaks product costs down to the component level. Sup-
pliers are asked to provide a detailed breakdown of their costs, including raw materi-
als, labor, tooling, and required packaging as well as delivery, administrative, and
other expenses. The breakdown of costs is helpful in suggesting ways that suppliers
can seek to improve and thereby reduce costs. Cost tables are jointly developed with
suppliers and used to find differences (line by line) across all elements of cost. A po-
tential area of disagreement involves the supplier&rsquo;s profits and overhead. A fair profit
is required but may be dependent on the level of investment. No fixed profit level is

<p>used in negotiations. Purchasing must then aggregate the parts costs and compare
them with the target costs. If total costs exceed target costs, the design must change
or costs must be reduced. Although the supplier&rsquo;s profit margins might be an easy
place to look for cost savings, Honda realizes that doing so would squander the trust
it worked hard to develop with suppliers.8
</p>
<p>Once a purchaser has established a target price with a supplier for the first year of
a contract, additional cost reductions over the life of the product can be made
through an ongoing effort to drive down costs year over year. This can be achieved
through a technique known as cost-savings sharing.
</p>
<p>Cost-Savings Sharing Pricing Defined
Cost-savings sharing differs from traditional market-based pricing in several ways.
</p>
<p>First, cost-sharing approaches require joint identification of the full cost to produce an
item, which is not the case with market-based pricing (where the buyer has little or
no knowledge of the supplier&rsquo;s costs). Second, profit is a function of the productive in-
vestment committed to the purchased item and a supplier&rsquo;s asset return requirements
(i.e., return on investment). Profit is not a direct function of cost (which is usually the
practice with market-driven prices). The cost-based approach provides a supplier with
incentives to pursue continuous performance improvement to realize shared cost sav-
ings and invest in productive assets. A later example illustrates these concepts.
</p>
<p>An important feature of cost-savings sharing is the financial incentives offered to
a seller for performance improvements above and beyond the improvements agreed
to in the purchase contract. This differs from the traditional market-based pricing ap-
proach where one party (usually the purchaser) seeks to capture all cost savings result-
ing from a supplier&rsquo;s improvement effort. Traditional pricing practices have been a
deterrent to cooperative efforts to make design, product, and process improvements.
A cost-savings sharing approach recognizes the need to provide financial incentives
to a supplier while enhancing closer relationships.
</p>
<p>Prerequisites for Successful Target
and Cost-Based Pricing
</p>
<p>In order for target and cost-based pricing to occur, there must be joint agreement
on a supplier&rsquo;s full cost to produce an item. Identification of all costs provides the ba-
sis for establishing joint improvement targets. The total cost to produce an item in-
cludes labor; materials; other direct costs; any costs due to start-up and production;
and administrative, selling, and other related expenses.
</p>
<p>Besides total cost components, the parties must jointly identify and agree upon
product volumes, target product costs at various points in time, and quantifiable pro-
ductivity and quality improvement projections. Each firm must also agree on the as-
set base and return requirement at the supplier that determines an item&rsquo;s profit.
</p>
<p>There must also be agreement on the point in time when mutual sharing of cost
savings takes place, as well as the formula used to share the rewards. Mutual sharing
of rewards usually occurs for savings above and beyond the performance improve-
ment targets agreed to in the purchase contract, and savings on any items incidental
to joint performance improvement targets.
</p>
<p>This approach requires a high degree of trust, information sharing, and joint prob-
lem solving. This process will fail if one firm takes advantage of the other or violates

<p>confidentiality of information sharing. There must also be a willingness to provide
the resources necessary to resolve problems affecting overall success.
</p>
<p>The ability to manage the risks associated with target pricing is another key prereq-
uisite. Perhaps the main risk concerns volume variability. Because volume affects cost
levels, both parties must carefully consider and manage the impact of changes from
planned volume projections. Higher-than-projected volumes will result in a supplier
achieving greater economies and lower per-unit costs. These lower costs, however,
are not the result of a supplier&rsquo;s performance improvement. Conversely, lower-than-
projected volumes may raise a supplier&rsquo;s average costs. Contractually, the parties
must determine how to manage changes from the buying plan.
</p>
<p>When to Use Collaborative Cost Management
Approaches
</p>
<p>A cost-based approach to determining price is clearly not appropriate for all pur-
chased items. Many items do not warrant cost analysis, or the marketplace determines
price. Based on the cost management portfolio matrix discussed earlier in the chapter,
it is obvious that products that are readily available from multiple sources, standard-
ized instead of customized, and heavily influenced by the market forces of supply and
demand do not fit the profile of items appropriate for cost-based pricing.
</p>
<p>What types of items are feasible for a cost-based cooperative approach? A cost-
based approach is feasible when the seller contributes high added value to an item
through direct or indirect labor and specialized expertise. This approach is particu-
larly appropriate for complex items customized to specific requirements. Also,
products requiring a conversion from raw material through value-added designs at a
supplier are possible candidates. Examples of such items include a specially designed

<p>antilock brake system or a dashboard for an automobile. These items require a high
value-added conversion from raw materials into a semifinished product. The supplier
also likely contributes design and engineering support.
</p>
<p>An Example of Target Pricing and Cost-Savings Sharing
Although actual target and cost-savings sharing agreements can be lengthy and
</p>
<p>complex, the following example demonstrates the fundamental principles of this stra-
tegic cost management approach. This example is based on an actual situation that oc-
curred between an automotive OEM and a first-tier supplier.
</p>
<p>A purchaser seeks to purchase a designed component that is part of a final end
product. The final selling price of the product has been determined through discus-
sions with marketing, and this figure has been rolled down (or disaggregated) to the
component level. As such, both parties have agreed to target a purchase (or selling)
price of $61 for the component for the first year. The purchaser has targeted this
price as one that will support meeting the overall target price of the final end product.
</p>
<p>Cost-savings sharing assumes that the buyer and seller will collaborate to identify
the most efficient processes to produce a product as the basis for the cost structure.
This approach does not reward inefficient processes or practices, and also assumes
that engineers at the buying organization are flexible and willing to modify product
specifications to align with the supplier&rsquo;s processes. Throughout this example the sup-
plier&rsquo;s costs and return requirements serve as the basis for determining a fair and com-
petitive price. Both parties agree to a negotiated cost-based approach because the
parties have developed a close working relationship, supporting the sharing of de-
tailed cost data, and because the supplier&rsquo;s cost structure is relatively efficient.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 11.15 on p. 415 details the costs and investment data needed to develop a
cost-based purchase contract.
</p>
<p>Both firms must identify the costs and supplier investment associated with the pur-
chased component, identify and agree on the supplier&rsquo;s asset return requirements,
and identify supplier commitments to annual performance improvement targets.
</p>
<p>These exhibits provide the basis for evaluating cost and price throughout the life
of the contract.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 11.16 details the cost breakdown and subsequent price of the component
for each year of this contract. Data for year 1 include the negotiated/analyzed informa-
tion presented in Exhibit 11.15. During the first year, the following events affected
the selling price at the start of year 2:
</p>
<p>&bull; Overall material costs rise by 4% due to raw material cost increases.
</p>
<p>&bull; A joint value analysis team identifies a substitute material that reduces mate-
rial costs by $1.50 per unit.
</p>
<p>&bull; Labor rates increase by 3% per unit due to a scheduled contractual increase
at the supplier.
</p>
<p>&bull; The supplier meets the agreed productivity improvement targets for reduced
scrap and improved labor productivity.
</p>
<p>Year 2 data include these events.
</p>
<p>&bull; The supplier receives 50% of the $1.50 material reduction identified by the
value analysis team.

<p>&bull; The profit figure for year 2 includes the supplier&rsquo;s share of the material
reduction.
</p>
<p>&bull; The selling price at the start of year 2 becomes $56.27.
</p>
<p>By focusing on joint and continuous performance improvement, the purchase price
was reduced at a time when material and labor costs actually increased. This example
illustrates the potential for improvement that can occur through joint price/cost
analysis.
</p>
<p>Establishing agreement on cost and price early in design and development sup-
ports the reduction of material costs through cooperative efforts. The use of cost-
savings sharing can induce both parties to work together to achieve mutual goals.
The purchaser reduces its cost curve for purchased items and also establishes a basis
for continuous cost-improvement initiatives. The supplier benefits from longer-term
contracts, a fair profit based on its asset investment, and increased competitiveness
due to improvements occurring because of the purchaser&rsquo;s insights and contributions.

<p>involved the voice of the factory (VOF) and the voice of the supplier in product design
decisions:
</p>
<p>We were involved in the negotiation of features that marketing wanted. Most
of the requests they wanted had to be justified and brought in front of the
team. The Voice of the Factory rep typically fought against any decisions that
would add complexity to the producibility of the product from an order fulfill-
ment perspective. The VOF team design was an upper management decision
that drove this individual into the team structure. However, the specific ways
that people went about communicating would typically vary by product and by
team. It was, however, part of the mission statement of each NPD team.
</p>
<p>Most of the people on the VOF team had physically been to a factory in order
to understand what people in the factories were facing day to day, especially
in preproduction factory build tests. The factory would tell the VOF reps what
the problems encountered in assembly were, and request that these issues be
brought forward to the design team. The VOF teams were therefore able to put
forth educated arguments to the NPD team. VOF teams also had weekly confer-
ence calls to update status and identify issue closure, and were tied to the
NPD team from start to finish.
</p>
<p>The teams emphasized the need for meaningful involvement of different business functions
in the idea generation phase, but also noted that this was a rarity, not a common occur-
rence in their organizations. A target cost process was established early on to provide targets
for the various groups on achieving the target cost for a unit. It quickly aligned marketing
and design with supply chain team members on how to achieve those costs at the compo-
nent and manufacturing level. On the component side the key driver was target cost&mdash;and re-
sponsibility was placed on all the groups that brought in that part or component. The four
major groups (R&amp;D, marketing, operations, and supply) agreed to the final target price. R&amp;D
looked at it from a best-case theoretical perspective, and some engineering teams did value
engineering to come up with a projected target cost. Supply chain, dealing with the real
world, would assess who could do it out there&mdash;and how close they could come to target
price&mdash;based on the size of the product and the part of the country (labor rates).
</p>
<p>Platform manufacturing capability and equipment was brought into the NPD
process&mdash;and we saved a lot. Proliferation of part numbers was an issue&mdash;so
we required people to carry over old parts into new products on amortized tool-
ing, which prevented proliferation of part numbers with minor changes made
only because engineers would design from the ground up. There were design
guidelines and rules calling for 40% carryover for new product. Then R&amp;D and
engineering and SCM would get together to decide on which ones would be car-
ried over. First R&amp;D would make recommendations, and then procurement
would check to see if tooling and equipment could sustain another four years
of production, and what the investment would be.
</p>
<p>The importance of establishing impact on customer needs, while weighing the feasibility of in-
troducing new technologies and parts, must be explicitly considered. For example, the manu-
facturer noted the following:
</p>
<p>If there were specific marketing features that were put forward to an individ-
ual team, the decision went one of two ways. If a senior vice president in-
sisted that the product had to have this feature, no one would say no, even ifS

<p>the core team did not like it. On the other hand, if marketing put forward a fea-
ture such as an additional keyboard option, the representative had to put to-
gether a business case, which identified how many extra will be sold, the
incremental margin derived, and so on.
</p>
<p>This same individual also emphasized that procurement could be playing a more significant
role in defining the technology roadmap for the product through its supply market intelli-
gence and knowledge of supplier roadmaps and evolving technologies:
</p>
<p>There is a real missed opportunity by not having the core NPD team involved
in the roadmap, which is published two years prior to roll-out. The upper man-
agement team makes changes or additions at that level, and there is typically
no time to provide input into that process. The NPD VOF and procurement reps
could better plan for capacity and align supplier planning processes earlier to
better prepare. Typically, however, the team will wait until the product is
kicked off before putting together the core team, as some products are killed,
and people do not want to put in effort on a product that is not definitely
going to go into the pipeline.

<p>Project Management Does It Better, Faster, and Cheaper
</p>
<p>According to a seasoned pro, project managers must constantly clarify the require-
ments in the faster-cheaper-better mandate, and negotiate their relative importance to the
project. The following example highlights some of the tradeoffs that project managers face
in building a home, as well as the contradictions. A supply manager working on real-world
projects will find this exercise to be a useful tool in helping to meet project expectations.
</p>
<p>Initial Project Scope Statement: Build a 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bathroom house.
</p>
<p>The Initial Project Scope doesn&rsquo;t address many parameters of the project. What is the most
important criterion for this project? Faster? Cheaper? Better? What does this say about the
quality of the house? What does the owner want to be better? We all know you can spend
whatever you want on a house, regardless of the size and number of rooms. Materials make
a huge difference. Quality would certainly be a factor. Both of those parameters would cre-
ate conflicts with faster and cheaper. It takes time and money to get the finest materials
and the best workers. That&rsquo;s where the blueprints and a list of materials come into play.
Those certainly help to specify exactly what shape the house should take and the types of ma-
terials to be used but typically would not specify the cost or timeline. That&rsquo;s what a building
contract is for and where project management becomes important. Let&rsquo;s look at some other is-
sues that would expand the current scope statement to make it clearer.
</p>
<p>Faster is dependent on lots of things. The weather is a factor. Worker availability is a factor,
with the right skills at the right time to complete every phase of the project. Building per-
mits can be a factor, as can financing and material delivery. There are literally hundreds of
things that can slow down or stop this project. How important is faster? Are you living in a
one-bedroom apartment with your family of four, ready to have a mental breakdown if you
don&rsquo;t get some space soon? Or do you have time and want to build the house well at a reason-
able cost, without concern about common delays? Perhaps there is a threshold for delay that
is not tolerable under any circumstances. This would be true if you have sold your existing
home and must be out by a certain date and don&rsquo;t want to move twice. Faster can usually
be attained with sacrifices to cheaper or better .
</p>
<p>Cheaper would be a large factor in most home-building projects because most people live on
a limited income. There is only so much house you can afford before the quality of life is af-
fected in other areas. Some people are so passionate about their homes, they are willing to
live &ldquo;house-poor.&rdquo; Mortgage companies use a rule of thumb that your monthly house ex-
penses (mortgage, taxes, utilities, maintenance) should not exceed 28% of your monthly
gross income. Some people will sacrifice equity (e.g., 30-year mortgage vs. 15-year mort-
gage) so they can get a better house, but they are trading off cheaper. The interest differ-
ence between those two finance deals is significant. Others are willing to shop for months or
years to find the perfect house or the perfect deal. Faster is sacrificed for better or cheaper.
Answers to these critical issues will be reflected in your expanded scope statement to clarify
your preferences.
</p>
<p>There is a documentary about a competition between builders in San Diego, California. The rules
were simple. Build a 1,500-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath home that must pass code
and meet design specifications, as fast as you can. This home had to be complete in every way
you would expect it to be before moving in. There were no limits on the amount of resources
that could be applied to the project. They were given as much time as they needed to plan
every detail needed to execute the build. The ultimate project management job was started.
</p>
<p>How much time do you think the winning team took to build the house? Weeks? Days? The
name of the documentary is &ldquo;Four-Hour House.&rdquo; The winning team actually built the home,

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Having the right tools and applying the right techniques is an essential part of supply
chain management. As the opening vignette illustrates, the skills needed to build a
quality house on time and within budget include the ability to (1) manage projects;
(2) assess costs associated with work to be done by subcontractors; (3) realize that
learning-curve principles will affect time and labor costs; (4) apply value engineering
(VE) to the design and construction of the home; (5) ensure the contractor purchases
materials in the appropriate quantities for maximum discounts; and (6) process map
the actual times required for the subactivities.
</p>
<p>To effectively accomplish their assignments, supply managers must be project man-
agers. They must be skilled in managing team assignments involving multiple tasks
and team members. Buyers must understand how to analyze competitive bids or nego-
tiate favorable prices due to learning improvements that occur at a supplier or subcon-
tractor. Process mapping helps identify and eliminate waste throughout the supply
chain. Value analysis (VA) supports continuous quality improvement. All of these
tools are important for purchasers to be effective in driving competitive success for
their organization.
</p>
<p>This chapter presents a set of tools and techniques that support effective purchas-
ing and supply chain management. The tools discussed include project management,
learning-curve analysis, value engineering/value analysis, quantity discount analysis
(QDA), and process mapping.
</p>
<p>Project Management
Project management is a valuable skill for supply chain managers to have because
</p>
<p>more and more work is being structured as projects. Projects have certain character-
istics that make them unique compared with other forms of work. A project is a
</p>
<p>to code and specifications, in a little more than three hours. Each team brought more than
300 workers to the site and every kind of equipment you could imagine to speed up the pro-
cess. The project plan was down to the minute, with many tasks being performed simulta-
neously. For example, the holes were being drilled in walls for electrical wire while the walls
were being built. The roof was being built off to the side of the house so it could be craned
into place when the structure was ready. The foundation used chemicals to quick-cure the ce-
ment so building could occur immediately after pouring the cement. It was amazing to watch
the coordination and enthusiasm of the teams as they performed what most would consider
impossible. They had decided that faster was more important than better or cheaper. Now
some would argue they wouldn&rsquo;t want to live in those houses, but they did meet quality stan-
dards. The homes were more expensive to build, but not radically. It just depends on what
you want from the project. It also demonstrated that months of planning were required to exe-
cute a project like this in a day.
</p>
<p>After taking preferences into account, our final Revised Project Scope Statement reads: Within
six months, and within a budget of $250,000, build a 2,000-square-foot, two-story home to
the attached design specifications. The owner must approve in writing any changes to materi-
als, costs, or building schedule.

<p>series of tasks that requires the completion of specific objectives within a certain time
frame; has defined start and stop dates; consumes resources, particularly time, person-
nel, and budget; and operates with limited resources. Examples of projects involving
purchasing and supply chain personnel include developing new products, developing
new management information systems, implementing value analysis recommenda-
tions, developing sourcing strategy, and initiating performance improvement plans at
a supplier. Project management can be crucial in applications that span several organi-
zations&mdash;from implementing enterprise resource planning systems and construction
projects to developing a marketing plan and creating a website.
</p>
<p>Defining Project Success
Because projects usually have a defined scope with agreed-upon tasks and responsi-
</p>
<p>bilities, it is often easier to measure project success as compared with other types of
work.
</p>
<p>Did a supplier quality improvement project improve supplier quality by the in-
tended amount? Was a new product developed within the time and budget con-
straints? Did the new product achieve its initial sales goals? In general, several
criteria define whether a project was successfully completed. These include whether
the project was completed within the following constraints:
</p>
<p>&bull; Within the allocated time period and budget
</p>
<p>&bull; At the proper performance or specification level as determined by the stated
goals and objectives of the project
</p>
<p>&bull; At a level accepted by the customer, user, or management
</p>
<p>&bull; With minimal or only mutually agreed-upon changes
</p>
<p>&bull; Without disturbing the main work flow of the organization
</p>
<p>Before initiating a project, supply managers should consider the following points:1
</p>
<p>&bull; Make sure the objectives and outcomes are championed by senior executive
management
</p>
<p>&bull; Place the program under the leadership of people with skill, credentials, and
credibility
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish an effective governance process with a cross-functional team
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain active participation from team members (e.g., use their talents)
</p>
<p>&bull; Break down the project into phased deliverables
</p>
<p>&bull; Manage expectations continuously and consistently
</p>
<p>&bull; Measure objectively
</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure rapid problem escalation and resolution
</p>
<p>Project Phases
Projects move through various phases from conception to completion. Exhibit
</p>
<p>12.1 summarizes six phases along with the characteristics defining the activities com-
prising each phase. The phases become increasingly detailed as projects progress
from concept through completion.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Concept
Early in the project management process, project planners must develop a broad
</p>
<p>concept or definition of the project. A broad project objective may include develop-
ing a new product for a certain market within a specified time and budget. Project
planners also identify any broad constraints facing the project. Budget estimates
made during the concept phase are usually accurate to within approximately 30%
compared with final budget targets.
</p>
<p>Project Definition
If a project is initially feasible, it proceeds to the definition phase. This phase re-
</p>
<p>quires the development of a project description that provides greater detail than the
concept phase. The project description identifies how to accomplish the work, how
to organize for the project, the personnel required to support the project, tentative
timing schedules, and tentative budget requirements. Budget estimates begin to be-
come more exact, with a target of approximately 5 to 10% of the actual final budget.
</p>
<p>Planning
Planning involves preparing detailed plans that identify the tasks, timing mile-
</p>
<p>stones, budgets, and resources required to support each task. This phase also includes
creating the organization that will carry out the project, often through the use of proj-
ect teams. The planning phase is particularly critical because there is a strong correla-
tion between effective planning and successful project outcomes.

<p>The project plan developed during the concept or project definition phase is usu-
ally not detailed enough to provide guidance during project implementation. Detailed
planning provides an opportunity for discussing each person&rsquo;s role and responsibili-
ties throughout the project. An organization must also define how the different tasks
and activities comprising the project will come together to complete the project.
</p>
<p>Preliminary Studies
A final phase before actually executing the project involves verifying the assump-
</p>
<p>tions in the project plan, including performing literature searches, conducting field in-
terviews, and gathering any required data. This phase confirms the planning work
performed (or not performed) to date. Once the project manager or team confirms
the assumptions made during detailed planning, then the actual performance of the
project begins.
</p>
<p>Performance
The performance phase involves carrying out the project&rsquo;s plan and reporting the
</p>
<p>work results on a continuous basis to management or customers. Effective planning
increases the likelihood that actual performance outcomes will meet expectations.
Project managers play a particularly important role here in coordinating and direct-
ing the work effort. Depending on the type of project, this may be the longest of the
six phases in terms of time and resources consumed.

Snapshot
</p>
<p>China: Calling All Project
Managers
</p>
<p>The economic growth in China has created a need for talented project managers. Greg
Balestrero, CEO of the Project Management Institute (PMI), the world's leading provider of
project management training and standards, discusses why and how the need for project
management professionals has grown.
</p>
<p>Q: Projects have been around since the Pyramids; why are project managers so impor-
tant now?
</p>
<p>A: There is the issue of assurance of repeatable success in projects, being able to predict a re-
sult and repeat it. This is particularly the case when you&rsquo;re talking about short life cycles,
for example, fourth- or fifth-generation products that have a life cycle of less than 12
months. Aligning project skills with product development skills is one of the most important
things. Then there is an obsessive demand for return on value earlier and earlier. Even if
you&rsquo;re not in product delivery but putting in an IT system in a new facility, the era of the
five-year project is long gone. Companies need the IT installation now, and within 12 months
it needs to be generating the value that it was set out to do. So there is this increase in
shortness.
</p>
<p>Q: What has been the impact of globalization on the challenges involved in project
management?
</p>
<p>A: Nowadays, when we talk about the project manager we are really talking about the global
project manager. Globalization&mdash;for good, bad, or however you look at it&mdash;has created a de-
mand for multicultural projects. Look at the Airbus A380: It required 1,500 suppliers and

<p>2,400 projects across 30 countries. That is pretty complex. When it first came out, the BMW
Z4 was seen as a very simple car; everyone thought it was pure German. But only about
18% of the products in that car are manufactured in Germany; 82% are manufactured in 30
other countries. When you are managing projects across cultural lines and national borders,
you must put in place a standard that is a common language, a common approach, so every-
one can answer the question &ldquo;Is it on budget?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s 1,500 suppliers working in
27 different currencies, you need an answer that is accurate and understandable to every-
one. We promote a global standard which we call the project management body of knowl-
edge. . . . It&rsquo;s like an operating system for projects.
</p>
<p>Q: Is there a shortage of people who can manage projects, be it middle managers, line
managers, or those who bring a project together?
</p>
<p>A: There&rsquo;s a shortage of project managers worldwide. And we are working 24/7 to provide edu-
cation and certification worldwide. There is no lack of demand for certified professionals in
project management. And if you add complex projects, be they the Three Gorges Dam, the Bei-
jing Olympics infrastructure, or space projects, there is a drought of people, so those that
are there can command good salaries worldwide.
</p>
<p>Q: How are you approaching the market for training project management professionals in
China?
</p>
<p>A: Our real focus in China is ensuring professionals recognize that our standards and our certi-
fication are the two most important things to them. Since 2001 we&rsquo;ve had 22,000 certified pro-
fessionals here in China&mdash;we call them Project Management Professionals&mdash;and the growth
rate is getting close to 50&ndash;60% a year. Without a doubt, China is seeing the fastest growth
in management professionals, and it&rsquo;s a demand for excellence in project management.
</p>
<p>Q: Is China&rsquo;s education platform sufficient? How many project managers does the country
need?
</p>
<p>A: There was an independent UN study that predicted they would need more than 100,000
trained, certified, qualified project managers over the next five years. These are not just bod-
ies that can go in and manage the projects but people who have been recognized as having
the skills and knowledge of standards as well as the right approach to get things done. And
that was in 2003; since then it has accelerated. The 11th Five-Year Plan has shown the
need to move infrastructure out into central China and&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s power generation,
roads, transportation, fresh drinking water, health care, education&mdash;it&rsquo;s all project-related.
This is then magnified by the scope and size of China.
</p>
<p>Q: How has the demand in China translated into growth for PMI?
</p>
<p>A: We have 225,000 members in 160 countries; in 1996, we had 12,000 members, mostly in
the United States. We are growing at a rate of 45% outside of North America, and when you
look at the Asia Pacific region, with half the world&rsquo;s population, that&rsquo;s where we are growing
in leaps and bounds.

<p>Postcompletion
Project managers or teams perform several important tasks during the postcomple-
</p>
<p>tion phase:
</p>
<p>&bull; Confirm that the final project meets the expectations of management or cus-
tomers. This usually involves a comparison of the project performance out-
come compared with the expected outcome established during earlier
planning.
</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct a post-implementation meeting to discuss the strengths and weak-

<p>Project Planning and Control Techniques
Various tools and techniques are available to plan, control, and coordinate work ac-
</p>
<p>tivities. These tools allow a project manager to track what requires completion, by
whom, and by when as specified in the project plan. These tools also allow perfor-
mance tracking over time, particularly in the areas of time and budget. Two popular
planning and control techniques are Gantt charts and project networking tools such as
Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT).
</p>
<p>Gantt Charts
A Gantt chart visually displays the tasks and times associated with a project. Named
</p>
<p>after Henry Gantt, the chart is a horizontal bar chart with activities listed vertically and
times or dates displayed horizontally. The advantage of Gantt charts is that they are
relatively inexpensive to develop and use and can convey a great deal of information.
The primary disadvantage is that for larger projects, they become increasingly difficult
to use or to keep up to date. In such cases, project management techniques such as
CPM and PERT are recommended. Exhibit 12.2 illustrates a Gantt chart for a project
involving the transfer of equipment to a supplier during an outsourcing project.
</p>
<p>CPM/PERT
Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) are
</p>
<p>two popular project control techniques, particularly for projects that are complex or in-
volve many activities or tasks. These techniques require the user to identify the activi-
ties or tasks that make up a project and to determine the sequence of those activities.
</p>
<p>Users apply CPM to projects where there is a single known time (referred to as a
deterministic time) for each activity with no variance. PERT applies to projects
where time estimates are variable or uncertain. Each activity in PERT has three time
estimates: (1) most likely, (2) pessimistic, and (3) optimistic. Project managers com-
bine these estimates to arrive at a single estimate of the expected activity time for
each activity within the network.

<p>Project control techniques allow project managers to monitor progress over time
while managing costs across all activities. Users can also determine the probability of
completing projects by certain target dates using normal distribution statistics.
</p>
<p>Readers requiring in-depth detail of probability analysis or time/cost tradeoffs are
urged to consult an operations research or project management textbook.
</p>
<p>Rules for Constructing a Project Management Network
A graphical network can be used to represent each PERT or CPM project. A net-
</p>
<p>work is a graphical representation that shows how each individual activity relates in
time and sequence to all other activities. Network illustrations are powerful because
they show how separate activities come together to form an entire project. The con-
struction of CPM and PERT project networks follows generally accepted rules or con-
ventions, shown in Exhibit 12.3 on pp. 432&ndash;433.
</p>
<p>Later in this section we will use a purchasing project example to demonstrate the
use of these rules, which apply only to constructing the network and do not yet in-
volve the use of time estimates.

<p>Project Management Example: Sourcing Strategy
A cross-functional team is responsible for developing a sourcing strategy, which
</p>
<p>will involve selecting a supplier follow-on systems development. The project has
three primary objectives: (1) develop a set of performance criteria along with the eval-
uation system to assess potential supplier performance; (2) identify, evaluate, and se-
lect suppliers for a critical commodity; and (3) develop an information technology
system that will evaluate the performance of selected suppliers on a continuous basis.
</p>
<p>The project manager has identified the following unique tasks that are required to
meet the primary objectives of this project. (The letters refer to the sequence of activi-
ties shown in Exhibit 12.4 on p. 434.)
</p>
<p>Exhibit 12.4 illustrates the network for this project. There are three paths of activi-
ties through this project: A&ndash;B&ndash;E&ndash;F&ndash;G&ndash;K; A&ndash;C&ndash;D&ndash;F&ndash;G&ndash;K; and A&ndash;H&ndash;I&ndash;J. (A path is
a continuous or connected flow of activities from project start to finish.) The project
manager must evaluate the progress of all three paths to ensure meeting the original
project objectives. After reviewing Exhibit 12.3, one of the primary benefits of net-
working should become clear: the ability to see the relationships among all the tasks
in a project.
</p>
<p>This rule may require the use of a dummy activity, which is simply an extension of the activity
that precedes it. In this case, the dummy activity is an extension of activity L. Dummy activities
have no expected activity time&mdash;they simply carry forward the time from the preceding activity.
</p>
<p>7. Networks start and finish at only a single event.

</p>
<p>In this example, the project starts and ends with two activities (A and B at the start and R and T
at the end). This rule requires each network to start and stop on a single event. There is no limit
to the number of activities that can begin or end at a single event.

<p>Three observations are important at this point. First, the project manager has not
identified the time associated with each task, only the tasks and their sequence. The
manager does not yet know which set of activities will make up the longest path (the
critical path) within the project. Second, projects continuously change over time. As
the project team progresses on its assignments, it must update the network to reflect
that progress. The network only looks like it does in Exhibit 12.4 at the beginning of
the project. PERT and CPM require regular updating with the most current informa-
tion available. Third, computer software, such as Microsoft Project, is available that
will construct the network and allow the user to perform various analyses. The most
challenging part of project management is defining the activities that make up a proj-
ect, the relationship between those activities, and the time and budget required for
completing the activities.

<p>Project Management with Time Estimates
The following steps describe how to develop a PERT network with variable time
</p>
<p>estimates.
</p>
<p>1. Identify each activity requiring completion during the project and the relation-
ship between those activities. This is a critical step. The activities should not
be too broad or too narrow in scope. They must be definable tasks with a
start and stop point whose completion supports the objectives of the project.
</p>
<p>2. Construct the network reflecting the proper precedence relationships using
the rules discussed earlier.
</p>
<p>3. Determine the three time estimates for each activity (optimistic = a, pessimis-
tic = b, and most likely = m). The optimistic and pessimistic estimates should
reflect the end points on the time estimate continuum. These times should
have only a 10 to 20% chance of actually occurring. Accurate time estimates
are critical. Inaccurate time estimates or those with a great deal of variability
will lessen the validity of the control process.
</p>
<p>4. Calculate the expected activity time for each activity using the following
formula:
</p>
<p>Expected Activity Time &frac14; &eth;a&thorn; 4m&thorn; b&THORN;=6
If activity G has an optimistic time of 5 weeks, a most-likely time of 6 weeks,
and a pessimistic time of 13 weeks, then its expected activity time is (5 +
24 + 13)/6 = 7.
</p>
<p>5. Place the expected activity times on the network under their respective activ-
ity branches and identify the critical path. The critical path is the longest (in
time) path of continuous activities through the network. Any delay for activi-
ties on the critical path will delay the entire project. There can be more than
one critical path in a project.
</p>
<p>6. Identify the early start (ES), late start (LS), early finish (EF), and late finish
(LF) times. These times also appear on the activity branch and provide a
great deal of information to the project manager:
</p>
<p>&bull; Early start. The earliest point in time an activity can begin.
</p>
<p>&bull; Late start. The latest point in time an activity can begin without delaying
the entire project.
</p>
<p>&bull; Early finish. The earliest time a project can finish given the expected activity
time. Early finish time equals ES + expected activity time.
</p>
<p>&bull; Late finish. The latest time an activity can finish without delaying the entire
project. Latest finish time equals LS + expected activity time.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Project Management Example with Time Estimates
Using the project presented earlier, we can now include time estimates (in weeks)
</p>
<p>and calculate the expected time for each activity. Project planners calculate these esti-
mates during the planning phase of project management.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 12.5 shows this project with all times displayed. When calculating times,
the user always completes the early start (ES) and early finish (EF) times, moving left
to right across the top of the network. Next, complete the bottom half of the net-
work, which includes the late finish (LF) and late start (LS) times, by moving right to
left through the network. Notice that all projects start at time 0, and not time 1.
</p>
<p>Activities E and D converge at the same event, which means that activity F, in
this case, requires the completion of both E and D before it can begin. It is common
for two or more activities to conclude at the same event. When this happens, the
early start (ES) time for the next activity (activity F) is the larger of the early finish
(EF) times for the preceding activities. This makes sense because the subsequent activ-
ity cannot start until all preceding activities are complete. Working right to left to ar-
rive at the late finish and late start times on the bottom half of the network, we
notice that three activities (B, C, and H) originate from the same event. In this case,
the smaller of the late start (LS) times becomes the late finish (LF) time for activity
A. In this case, two weeks is the late finish time for activity A.
</p>
<p>The longest path (in time) through the network is the critical path. It is also the
path on which the connected activities each have no slack. In our example, the criti-
cal path of this project consists of activities A&ndash;B&ndash;E&ndash;F&ndash;G&ndash;K. Any delay beyond the es-
timated times for each activity will result in a delay to the entire project. Project
managers must always be aware of the status of critical path activities because they
have no time slack.
</p>
<p>The difference between the late start and early start (LS &minus; ES) or the late finish
and early finish (LF &minus; EF) times is slack&mdash;the maximum amount of leeway in an activ-
ity that will not delay the entire project. Activities without any slack (activities A, B,
E, F, G, and K) are by definition on the critical path. Activities not on the critical
path will have slack.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Of special interest to project managers is a project&rsquo;s path slack&mdash;the amount of
time that activities along the path can be delayed without delaying the entire project.
</p>
<p>Notice in our example there are three continuous paths throughout the project. Ex-
hibit 12.5 details the paths and their total time. Of the three paths, A&ndash;B&ndash;E&ndash;F&ndash;G&ndash;K is
the longest path at 25.2 weeks. None of the activities on this path have any slack.
</p>
<p>The length of the path equals the sum of the expected activity times for each activ-
ity on that particular path. Note that the length of path A&ndash;C&ndash;D&ndash;F&ndash;G&ndash;K is 23.8
weeks. We must further notice that the slack for this path resides in only two activi-
ties&mdash;C and D each have two weeks of slack. However, this does not mean there are
a total of four weeks of slack. There are only two weeks between the two activities. If
activity C finishes at week 7.8 instead of 5.8, then activity D no longer has any slack
because it now cannot start until week 7.8.
</p>
<p>Project management tools are critical when managing large-scale projects, such as
the example discussed in the opening vignette. Purchasing professionals are manag-
ing an increasing number of projects involving more than one functional area and
large amounts of resources. To do this effectively, they must have an understanding
of project management control tools and techniques.

<p>Learning-Curve Analysis
Learning curves establish the rate of improvement due to learning as producers real-
</p>
<p>ize direct-labor cost improvements as production volumes increase. When referring
to learning improvement, the learning rate represents a reduction in the cumulative
average number of labor hours as production doubles from a previous level. For exam-
ple, with an 85% learning rate, the average amount of direct labor required to pro-
duce a single unit declines by 15% each time production doubles.
</p>
<p>With a 90% rate, direct-labor requirements decrease by 10% each time production
doubles. The fundamental principle of the learning curve is that as production dou-
bles, direct-labor requirements decline by an observed and predictable rate. The rate
of improvement varies from situation to situation.
</p>
<p>Why should purchasers be concerned with learning curves? If learning occurs at a
supplier during the performance of a purchase contract and the buyer does not take
that into account, then the supplier will reap the financial benefits that result from
learning. If learning occurs, the benefits must go somewhere&mdash;either into the suppli-
er&rsquo;s profit line, or to the buyer&rsquo;s cost savings budget! In collaborative relationships,
buyers and suppliers can work together to mutually share the benefits of learning
curves and productivity improvements.
</p>
<p>Learning curves apply to the average direct labor required to produce a unit of out-
put. The labor component is usually the easiest data to gather because companies as-
sign direct-labor hours to specific items or projects. Historically, the term &ldquo;learning
curve&rdquo; refers to the reduced direct-labor requirement per unit of output due to the ef-
fects of learning. This empirically derived concept was first noted by Boeing Corpora-
tion, which noticed that the amount of time required to build the same model
aircraft decreased over time. The term &ldquo;experience curve&rdquo; refers to the longer-term
factors of production that systematically reduce production costs. These factors in-
clude the shorter-term labor component along with longer-term product and process
modifications.
</p>
<p>Components of the Learning or Experience Curve
What drives the expected cost reductions, which are the basis of the learning
</p>
<p>curve and the broader experience curve? Different factors combine to produce a learn-
ing effect. The first factor is the workforce. This includes the ability of the worker on
the job to learn and improve through repetitive effort and increased efficiency, and
the effort by management to pursue productivity gains.
</p>
<p>The next factor includes modifications to the production process. Because labor im-
provements quickly reach the point of smaller and smaller returns, management of-
ten relies on process changes to realize continuous improvement. Management may
introduce new production methods, substitute increased automation for labor, or pur-
sue vertical integration that results in greater cost control. Some firms also update
their process technology during the life of a product to take advantage of improve-
ments offered with newer equipment. Offering a supplier a longer-term contract with
guaranteed volumes, for example, encourages investment in equipment that results in
lower production costs.

<p>When to Use the Learning Curve
Not all processes or items benefit from or exhibit improvement from learning. In
</p>
<p>fact, when used incorrectly, this approach can result in a significant underestimation
of true production costs. The learning-curve approach applies when certain operating
conditions are present.
</p>
<p>Learning-curve analysis is appropriate when a supplier uses a new production pro-
cess or produces an item for the first time. Production efficiency usually increases as
a supplier&rsquo;s workforce become familiar with a new process. The learning curve is also
appropriate when a supplier produces a technically complex item for the first time.
The approach is also appropriate when an item has high direct-labor content.
</p>
<p>The human factors present at the beginning of production must remain fairly con-
stant over time to apply the learning curve. If an organization experiences high turn-
over, then the workforce may not demonstrate the anticipated rate of learning. For

</p>
<p>Accelerating the Learning
Curve in an Online World
</p>
<p>In the 1980s Japanese manufacturing techniques were in vogue. You could hardly read
the business press without encountering mention of &ldquo;lean manufacturing,&rdquo; &ldquo;just-in-time in-
ventory systems,&rdquo; and &ldquo;total quality management.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hear much about these ideas anymore, but not because they are no longer in fash-
ion. Quite the reverse is true: The practices have become so widely adopted that they are no
longer newsworthy.
</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is American executives&mdash;especially those from high-tech industries&mdash;who are
lecturing the rest of the world on the wonders of Web 2.0 and the latest new new thing ema-
nating from Silicon Valley.
</p>
<p>It is therefore a paradox that one of the most important drivers of online business success
is taken directly from the pages of Japanese management techniques. I am referring to kai-
zen, the practice of continuous improvement.
</p>
<p>Kaizen doesn&rsquo;t just mean a business should keep trying new things. Rather, it refers to a disci-
plined process of systematic exploration, controlled experimentation, and then painstaking
adoption of the new procedures. In the original formulation, kaizen was applied to manufactur-
ing, where experimentation could determine whether a new process resulted in quality improve-
ments or cost savings in a matter of months.
</p>
<p>It is much more difficult to apply kaizen to product design, because it can easily take years
to design and market a new product. To take a recent example, the iPhone has been two
and a half years in the making.
</p>
<p>Product development can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, making it almost impossible
to run a controlled experiment with a product introduction.
</p>
<p>But it is simple to run a controlled experiment with a web page. Amazon can show a differ-
ent page layout to every hundredth visitor and determine in a few days whether the new de-
sign increases sales.
</p>
<p>Similarly, a search engine can run a controlled experiment to try out a new tweak to its

<p>The cycle of exploration, experimentation, and adoption is drastically shortened for web-based
applications. This isn&rsquo;t just the old atoms and bits distinction. Vista, Microsoft&rsquo;s new operat-
ing system, has also taken years to develop and only time will tell how successful it will be.
</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between Vista and Google? There is no feasible way for Microsoft to ex-
periment with Vista in real time; but it is very easy for Google to conduct controlled experi-
ments and do so more or less continuously.
</p>
<p>Given a performance measure, be it clicks, revenue, or something entirely different, a disci-
plined process of experimentation and evaluation can lead to rapid improvement. The easier
it is to experiment and the larger the number of users, the quicker this process can work.
</p>
<p>The most successful online businesses are built on kaizen, though few of those who carry
out the testing would recognize the term, because many of those who created these online
businesses were in grade school in the 1980s.
</p>
<p>Old media just do not understand online kaizen. Their perceptions are tied to the print world,
where design changes are costly. The Wall Street Journal spent years planning its recent rede-
sign of the print edition and millions of dollars rolling it out. Yet it will be months before it be-
comes clear how successful these changes were.
</p>
<p>By contrast, small tweaks in the page layout of online content can be very effective in improv-
ing user satisfaction and ad clicks. Controlled experiments can be used to determine the im-
pact of these changes in days rather than months.
</p>
<p>Yet how many mainstream publishers have web page software that allows for such con-
trolled experimentation? In most cases, there is but one layout, and experimentation is diffi-
cult if not impossible. You can&rsquo;t manage what you can&rsquo;t measure&mdash;and if you can&rsquo;t easily
experiment with what you are doing, management is seriously handicapped.
</p>
<p>Kaizen means that the companies currently in an industry have an inherent advantage over
new entrants. Entrants have to guess what will work; the companies that are already operat-
ing can experiment and find out.
</p>
<p>This information advantage doesn&rsquo;t preclude new entries; it just makes it more costly be-
cause the learning curve is steeper.
</p>
<p>Amazon has some worthy competition in online department stores. But how likely is it that a
new entrant will emerge from nowhere and successfully compete in this area? The experience
that existing online retailers like Amazon, Buy.com, and eBay have built up is hard to dupli-
cate. A new entrant, even one as strong as Wal-Mart, finds the online world rough going.
</p>
<p>This is not to say that new entry is impossible. As the old saying goes, &ldquo;You can always tell
the pioneers, they&rsquo;re the ones with the arrows in their backs.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>New entrants have the advantage of avoiding earlier mistakes. They can copy successful op-
erations and, in many cases, improve on them. Newer, faster, and more flexible information
systems can sometimes confer a competitive advantage on new entrants over the pioneers
stuck with the last generation of computing infrastructure.
</p>
<p>But the ability to experiment easily is a critical factor for web-based applications. The online
world is never static. There is a constant flow of new users, new products, and new technolo-
gies. Being able to figure out quickly what works and what doesn&rsquo;t can mean the difference
between survival and extinction.

<p>example, in the 1960s the Douglas Aircraft Company experienced high turnover due
to a tight labor market during the initial production of its DC-9. The company was un-
able to realize the labor efficiencies it had factored into the sales price of the aircraft.
The resulting higher-than-planned costs created a financial strain on the company.
</p>
<p>Learning curves require the accurate collection of cost and labor data, particularly
during the early stages of production. A buyer must have confidence that learning oc-
curs at a uniform rate and that any improvements result from employee learning. Ini-
tial production data often provide the basis for negotiation regarding expected
improvement rates and scheduled price reductions.
</p>
<p>Learning Curve Illustrated
Exhibit 12.6 provides direct-labor data for a purchased item over increasing levels
</p>
<p>of output. Learning-curve examples can become quite complex, especially when using
logarithmic scales to show the relationship between units produced and labor
requirements.
</p>
<p>This simple example illustrates the effect on the average labor requirement due to
a fairly consistent rate of learning.
</p>
<p>Each column in Exhibit 12.6 provides data needed to estimate the cumulative learn-
ing rate for this supplier:
</p>
<p>&bull; Column A: The total units produced over a period of time. In this example,
a total of 64 units were produced.
</p>
<p>&bull; Column B: The cumulative total labor hours (TLH) required to produce a
given level of units. This supplier used 288 total labor hours to produce 32
total units but only 493 total labor hours to double production to 64 total
units.
</p>
<p>&bull; Column C: The total labor hours for a given level of output divided by the
units produced. The figure represents the cumulative average labor per unit
of output.
</p>
<p>&bull; Column D: The associated learning rate for each doubling of production.
The learning rate from one to two units of production equals (20 LH/unit &minus;
17 LH/unit)/(20 LH/unit) = 0.15 or 15%. Note that LH/unit is the average

<p>labor hours per unit and is calculated by dividing the total labor hours (col-
umn B) by the number of units (column A). The learning rate from two to
four units equals
</p>
<p>&eth;17 LH=unit &minus; 14.5 LH=unit&THORN;=&eth;17 LH=unit&THORN; &frac14; 0.147 or 14.7%
Each level can be calculated in a similar way.
</p>
<p>This analysis reveals that the supplier has an approximately 85% learning curve
for this item, which means that as production doubles, the direct labor required to
produce a unit should decrease 15% on average. A producer realizes the most dra-
matic learning improvements over early volumes when the effect from learning is the
greatest.
</p>
<p>The successful use of the learning curve requires knowing when and how to apply
the technique. A buyer&rsquo;s objective must be to use the tool to identify anticipated la-
bor costs for increasingly larger production volumes. An analyst often cannot iden-
tify a learning rate until some preliminary production data are available. If data are
not available, one approach is to rely on historical learning rates or previously ob-
served rates at a supplier.
</p>
<p>Learning-Curve Problem
A buyer does business with a supplier that uses a production process that histori-
</p>
<p>cally demonstrates an 80% learning curve; that is, as production rates double, there is
a 20% reduction in the average direct-labor hours required to produce a unit. Given
this learning rate, a buyer hopes to capture this reduced labor requirement through a
lower purchase price.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 12.7 outlines one use of the learning curve in purchasing. In this example,
the buyer expects the per-unit price on a 600-unit order to lower from $228 to $170
due to learning. Whether the buyer actually receives a $170 unit price will probably be
subject to negotiation. The supplier may argue that overhead did not change since the
original order and should remain at $50 per unit. The supplier&rsquo;s profit is affected as
both direct and overhead costs decline and profit remains at 20% of total costs. The
buyer may counter that material costs should decline due to larger volumes. The key
point is that the buyer now has a price range for negotiation with the supplier.
</p>
<p>Learning-curve analysis highlights a key reason why many purchasers consolidate
purchase volumes with fewer suppliers. Astute buyers know that an even lower pur-
chase price may be obtained if the buyer correctly factors in the effects of learning as
production volumes increase.
</p>
<p>Value Analysis/Value Engineering
Value analysis involves examining all elements of a component, assembly, end
</p>
<p>product, or service to make sure it fulfills its intended function at the lowest total
cost. Value analysis techniques are primarily applied to existing products and ser-
vices. In contrast, value engineering is the application of value principles during prod-
uct or service design. VE is a much more proactive approach to embracing value
concepts. Larry Miles is said to have started using the technique at General Electric
in the late 1940s and is considered the father of VA/VE.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The basic component of VA and VE is value&mdash;the lowest total cost at which an
item, product, or service achieves its primary function while satisfying the time,
place, and quality requirements of customers. Although value analysis traditionally ap-
plies to tangible products, there is no reason that companies cannot apply VA tech-
niques to services.
</p>
<p>The primary objective of value analysis is to increase the value of an item or ser-
vice at the lowest cost without sacrificing quality. In equation form, value is the rela-
tionship between the function of a product or service and its cost:
</p>
<p>Value &frac14; Function=Cost
</p>
<p>Exhibit 12.7 Learning-Curve Problem
</p>
<p>XYZ Corporation is buying a new item produced by a process that historically demonstrates an 80% learning curve. A buyer has
placed an order for 200 pieces and receives a quote of $228 per unit. The buyer has accumulated the following per-unit cost data:
</p>
<p>Material $ 90
Direct labor $ 50 (Five hours on average per unit at $10 per hour)
Overhead $ 50 (Assume 100% of direct labor)
Total costs $190
Profit $ 38 (Difference between per-unit price and total costs, which equals 20% of total costs)
Total per unit $228 (Quoted price)
</p>
<p>The buyer wants to place a second order for an additional 600 pieces, or a combined total order of 800. How much should the buyer ex-
pect to pay per unit given the expected benefit of the learning curve (which affects direct-labor requirements)?
</p>
<p>1. Calculate the average labor hours for the entire combined order of 800 units:
From the first order, 200 units required an average of 5 hours labor per unit. Therefore, 400 units should require only 80% as much
as the original 200, or an average of 4 hours of labor per unit, given an 80% learning rate. 800 units should require an average of
3.2 hours of labor per unit (80% of 4 hours is 3.2 hours). One of the guidelines of learning curve is that labor costs decrease by a
predictable rate each time production doubles.
</p>
<p>2. Calculate the hours required for the total combined order of 800 units less the labor incurred for the original 200-piece order:
</p>
<p>800 units � 3.2 average hours=unit &frac14; 2,560 total hours
Less:
</p>
<p>200 units � 5 average hours per unit &frac14; 1,000 &eth;direct labor required for original 200-piece order&THORN;
1,560 total labor hours required for the next 600 units
</p>
<p>3. Calculate the additional total and per-unit labor cost for the additional 600-unit order:
</p>
<p>1,560 hours � $10 per direct-labor hour &frac14; $15,600 total additional labor cost
$15,600=600 units &frac14; $26 per unit
</p>
<p>4. Calculate the expected new per-unit price for the additional 600-piece order:
</p>
<p>Additional 600 pieces per-unit cost
</p>
<p>Material $ 90 (Remains unchanged, although higher quantities may reduce the per-unit material cost)
Direct labor $ 26
Overhead $ 26 (Assume 100% of direct labor)
Total costs $142
Profit (20%) of total costs $ 28.40
Total per unit $170.40

<p>There are many variations of function and cost that will increase the value of a
product or service. The most obvious ways to increase value include increasing the
functionality or use of a product or service while holding cost constant, reducing cost
while not reducing functionality, and increasing functionality more than increasing
cost. For example, offering a five-year warranty versus a two-year warranty with no
price increase raises the value of a product to the customer.
</p>
<p>Value analysis is a way to achieve continuous performance improvement in an
item, product, or service. It is not a technique for cheapening a product or service by
lowering quality or other performance attributes below what customers expect. Many
firms realize that VA is a powerful technique that can help a firm achieve its continu-
ous cost and quality improvement targets.
</p>
<p>Who Is Involved in Value Analysis?
Value analysis, certainly not exclusively a purchasing tool, involves many organiza-
</p>
<p>tional functions. However, because most products and services require major inputs
from suppliers, purchasing should take an active role in coordinating value analysis ac-
tivities. A common approach for using value analysis involves creating a VA team
composed of professionals with knowledge about a product or service. Many func-
tional groups can contribute to the value analysis team:
</p>
<p>&bull; Executive management. Executive management provides overall guidance
and support for the VA process and allocates the time, budget, and person-
nel to work actively on VA projects.
</p>
<p>&bull; Suppliers. Because much of what value analysis examines involves the cost
and design of component parts, it is logical to request input from suppliers,
a group that can propose alternative materials, provide insights into what
other firms are doing, and identify lower-cost production methods.
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchasing. Purchasing often takes a primary role in organizing the VA ef-
fort by coordinating and disseminating relevant information.
</p>
<p>&bull; Design engineering. Design engineers evaluate any proposed changes to the
design of an item. They also help define product function, establish quality
and engineering standards, and evaluate the effect of VA changes on other
parts within the product.
</p>
<p>&bull; Marketing. The marketing group provides insight about the impact that VA
changes may have on customers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Production. The production group has the responsibility of producing final
items or products, and it can also propose better ways to produce an item
or service to achieve higher quality or lower total cost. It is essential that
this group be informed about any changes proposed by other functional
groups.
</p>
<p>&bull; Industrial/process engineering. This group can contribute extensively, particu-
larly when discussing methods of producing and delivering a product or ser-
vice. Industrial/process engineers can evaluate proposed manufacturing
methods, material handling and flow, the effect of alternative materials on
the production process, and packaging requirements.
</p>
<p>&bull; Quality control. Quality control can evaluate the impact on quality that pro-
posed changes may have. Quality control can also establish how and where
to evaluate quality performance levels for a proposed production method.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This group can also work with purchasing to support quality control efforts
at suppliers.
</p>
<p>Tests for Determining Value in a Product or Service
Value analysis teams ask a number of questions to determine if opportunities exist
</p>
<p>for item, product, or service improvement:
</p>
<p>1. Does the use of this product contribute value to our customers?
</p>
<p>2. Is the cost of the final product proportionate to its usefulness?
</p>
<p>3. Are there additional uses for this product?
</p>
<p>4. Does the product need all its features or internal parts?
</p>
<p>5. Are product weight reductions possible?
</p>
<p>6. Is there anything else available to our customers given the intended use of the
product?
</p>
<p>7. Is there a better production method to produce the item or product?
</p>
<p>8. Can a lower-cost standard part replace a customized part?
</p>
<p>9. Are we using the proper tooling considering the quantities required?
</p>
<p>10. Will another dependable supplier provide material, components, or subassemblies
for less?
</p>
<p>11. Is anyone currently purchasing required materials, components, or subassemblies
for less?
</p>
<p>12. Are there equally effective but lower-cost materials available?
</p>
<p>13. Do material, labor, overhead, and profit equal the product&rsquo;s cost?
</p>
<p>14. Are packaging cost reductions possible?
</p>
<p>15. Is the item properly classified for shipping purposes to receive the lowest trans-
portation rates?
</p>
<p>16. Are design or quality specifications too tight given customer requirements?
</p>
<p>17. If we are making an item now, can we buy it for less (and vice versa)?
</p>
<p>The most likely VA improvement areas include modifying product design and ma-
terial specifications, using standardized components in place of custom components,
substituting lower-cost for higher-cost materials, reducing the number of parts that a
product contains, and developing better production or assembly methods.
</p>
<p>The Value Analysis Process
Value analysis projects follow a systematic approach consisting of five stages:
</p>
<p>1. Gather information
</p>
<p>2. Speculate
</p>
<p>3. Analyze
</p>
<p>4. Recommend and execute
</p>
<p>5. Summarize and follow up
</p>
<p>These stages occur after identifying an item or product as a VA candidate.

</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Purchasing and Supply Chain Analysis 445</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Gather Information
The first stage for any value analysis project requires agreement about an item or
</p>
<p>product&rsquo;s primary and secondary functions for customers. VA participants should
ask, &ldquo;What does this product do for the customer?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why does a customer buy
this product?&rdquo; It is important to understand a product&rsquo;s primary and secondary func-
tions. Value analysis experts recommend naming each function of an item or prod-
uct with two words&mdash;a verb and a noun. After this is complete, the team must agree
on which functions are primary versus secondary. For example, the primary function
of an industrial pump may be to move fluids at a rate required by the customer. A sec-
ondary function may be to minimize noise in the customer&rsquo;s facility. In this case, the
VA team must recognize that moving fluids is the primary function of the industrial
pump. Minimizing noise, a secondary consideration for industrial pumps, still must
receive attention during analysis.
</p>
<p>During this stage, detailed information about the item or product is collected.
This includes sales trends, supplier performance data, costs to make and sell, design
drawings, quantity estimates, and production method analyses.
</p>
<p>Speculate
This stage calls for wide-open or creative thinking on the part of the VA team.
</p>
<p>Brainstorming is ideal as the team evaluates an item or product against the various
tests or questions presented earlier. The primary objective of this phase is to develop
as many improvement ideas as possible while withholding judgment on any one alter-
native. A VA team moves to the analysis stage after it exhausts its ideas about how
to improve a particular item or product.
</p>
<p>Analyze
This stage critically evaluates the different ideas put forth during the speculation
</p>
<p>phase. Analysis can include cost/benefit calculations or assessment of the feasibility
of implementing an idea. The result is a set of ideas that satisfy the original goals
and objectives of the VA effort. This phase is very specific and no longer involves
generalities.
</p>
<p>Recommend and Execute
Up to this point the VA process has generated only a prioritized list of ideas. The
</p>
<p>team may have to present its proposals to executive management for approval. Mov-
ing an idea from the team to the organization requires the ability to motivate others,
creativity, good communication skills, the ability to think analytically, solid product
knowledge, commitment, and salesmanship.
</p>
<p>Once a team receives approval, it must implement its ideas. Some ideas will be
quite simple to carry out, whereas others will be more complex. The team must de-
velop a project plan with timings, budget requirements, and responsibilities. The
team often has to generate support outside the team for its proposals and help dur-
ing implementation.
</p>
<p>Summarize and Follow Up
This step is common during the implementation of any idea or plan. It may be
</p>
<p>the responsibility of the VA team or group to follow up and track implementation
progress. The team may also track the gains achieved by the VA effort.

<p>Quantity Discount Analysis
Quantity discount analysis is a technique used to examine the incremental changes
</p>
<p>in cost between quantities within a supplier&rsquo;s price quotation. This tool allows the
user to verify that quantity discounts are reasonable. Using this technique, a buyer
may be able to negotiate price improvements through a better understanding of incre-
mental unit costs.
</p>
<p>There are two primary types of quantity discount analyses. The first involves prices
at specific quantities, whereas the second examines discounts over quantity ranges.
</p>
<p>Quantity Discount Analysis Illustrated
Exhibit 12.8 on p. 448 demonstrates how to use QDA when a buyer has price
</p>
<p>breaks at specific quantities. Exhibit 12.9 on pp. 449&ndash;450 illustrates how to use QDA
when a buyer has price breaks in ranges of quantities. The exhibits explain how to per-
form the appropriate calculations.
</p>
<p>When using quantity discount analysis, the key calculation is the incremental cost
of each additional unit at different quantity levels. In Exhibit 12.8, even though the
original quote at the three quantity levels moves lower on a per-unit basis, the incre-
mental cost for units 7&ndash;10 ($67.50) is actually higher than for units 4&ndash;6 ($60). The
same type of situation occurs in Exhibit 12.9. A buyer faced with this quote would
want to know why incremental unit costs increase rather than decrease. Often, the
supplier is unaware why the incremental costs are higher.
</p>
<p>QDA provides the buyer with information for questioning and negotiating im-
provements in the discount schedule. The analysis often reveals an up-and-down
roller-coaster effect between incremental price differences. Questions asked because
of a QDA often produce additional discounts and a better understanding of the quota-
tion by the buyer and seller. The buyer should not accept a quote that features
higher incremental costs as volumes increase unless the supplier can provide a valid
explanation.
</p>
<p>Process Mapping
Process mapping is a tool that reduces processes to their component parts or activi-
</p>
<p>ties and helps identify and then eliminate non-value-added activities (waste) or de-
lays within a process. Process mapping is valuable in purchasing, for example, when
attempting to streamline the flow of material or information between suppliers and a
purchaser.
</p>
<p>Organizations have many processes that, when taken together, define the organiza-
tion&rsquo;s primary work. A process is essentially an outcome composed of a set of tasks,
activities, or steps. How well an organization performs these tasks determines how effi-
cient and effective it is at that process. The following supply chain processes are
among those that most businesses perform:
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier evaluation and selection
</p>
<p>&bull; Supply-base management
</p>
<p>&bull; New-product design and development
</p>

</p>
<p>2. Instructions
</p>
<p>Line 1: Place specific quantity ranges from the supplier quotation on line 1 in the appropriate column. Each column represents a
specific quantity range provided by the supplier.
</p>
<p>Line 2: Place the price per unit within each quantity range in the appropriate column. This is information provided by the supplier
on the quote.
</p>
<p>Line 3: &ldquo;Total price per order&rdquo; equals the lowest quantity in a range from line 1 times the &ldquo;Price per unit&rdquo; in line 2 for each
column. For example, for column C (quantity range 11&ndash;20), &ldquo;Total price per order&rdquo; equals 11 &times; $7.80 = $85.80.
</p>
<p>Line 4: Take the &ldquo;Total price per order&rdquo; from the next-highest quantity range (line 3) and divide this by &ldquo;Price per unit&rdquo; for the
column being calculated. For example, for column A, the maximum units to order equals 48/10 equals 4.8. For column B,
the maximum units to order equals 85.80/8 = 10.7, and so on. Round down to the nearest whole number.
</p>
<p>Line 5: This equals line 2 times line 4 for each column.
</p>
<p>Line 6: Calculate the difference between the &ldquo;Total price maximum order&rdquo; for successive quantity ranges. For example, the &ldquo;Total
price per maximum order&rdquo; for column B (6&ndash;10 quantity range) is $80, while the &ldquo;Total price per order&rdquo; for column A (1&ndash;5
quantity range) is $40. The difference is $40, which appears in column A on line 6. Calculate all other columns on line 6
accordingly.
</p>
<p>Line 7: This is the difference between line 4 and the preceding column value on line 4. It is the difference between the maximum
units to order from one quantity range to the next.
</p>
<p>Line 8: This equals line 6 divided by line 7 for each column. It represents the incremental cost for each unit within that quantity
range.

<p>Most processes cross more than one functional boundary. When this happens,
there is a risk that no one actually owns or takes responsibility for the entire process.
In fact, some departments may actually have goals that are in conflict with one an-
other. A transportation department evaluated on cost may use the least expensive
method possible, such as rail. Customer service, on the other hand, may want to
make material available to customers as soon as possible, which implies speed. Rapid
delivery will likely increase transportation costs. These two groups may thus have
goals that conflict.
</p>
<p>Organizations use process mapping to redesign or re-engineer processes. There
are two basic types of processes: sequential and concurrent. Sequential processes are
those in which the set of steps or activities comprising the activity occur one after
the other. As shown in the following diagram, Activity B does not begin until A is
complete, whereas C does not begin until B is complete. When mapping processes,
we may place time estimates of the activity along with the sequence of the activities.
A primary goal of process mapping is to eliminate waste from a process. Activity
times are important to this goal.
</p>
<p>Concurrent processes consist of activities or steps performed concurrently during
the main flow of work. For example, many organizations are attempting to develop
new products concurrently rather than sequentially, which not only saves time and
money but also allows agreement on major issues early in the process.

<p>Cross-functional teams often use process mapping. Because most processes move
across functional boundaries, it is logical to have those groups connected with the pro-
cess involved with mapping and improving the process. This involvement will help
generate buy-in from different groups concerning any proposed changes while keep-
ing all impacted groups informed of those changes.

<p>A Day in the Life of a Pro-
curement Project Manager
</p>
<p>Carlton W. Bradshaw, C.P.M., a procurement project manager for Eaton Corp., arrives
at the office between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. and prepares for the day checking e-mail, voice
mail, faxes, and so forth. Big question: Just how unusual or normal will today be?
</p>
<p>It can be said that the day in the life of a project manager is never really typical and for
many that&rsquo;s what makes this specialized career exciting. Meetings, check-up on progress,
evaluation of project by key players, checking future needs for upcoming critical events, and
much more&mdash;these elements keep project managers hopping. And here&rsquo;s what it looks like.
</p>
<p>8:30 a.m.: It&rsquo;s Wednesday and time for the &ldquo;core teams&rdquo; meeting&mdash;the people who are func-
tional representatives of a project team. The meeting lasts an hour and a half, and several is-
sues are reviewed. Each team member takes information back to his or her respective
function.
</p>
<p>10:00 a.m.: Next comes a meeting with Susan Whalen, engineering process development man-
ager, whose responsibilities include engineering processes. Bradshaw and Whalen discuss
how procurement will support engineering on various projects, and Bradshaw identifies any
special needs that might arise. All this takes place on a high process level.
</p>
<p>11:00 a.m.: Back in the office, Bradshaw does follow up and department management tasks.
</p>
<p>1:00 p.m.: A subproject team that supports larger project teams in connection with materials
in the pipeline and cost reduction meets. This is a detail-oriented working meeting. Engineer-
ing could have from 15 to 30 miniprojects going under the umbrella of a larger one, and
this subteam works out the details of these aspects. A weekly meeting establishing engineer-
ing priority also takes place. This focuses on the larger horizon of engineering marketing&mdash;
where are the markets going further out? Bradshaw represents procurement at these meet-
ings. They are typically two hours long and focus on three market segments, one per
meeting.
</p>
<p>3:00 p.m.: A weekly supplier-driven cost-reduction program meeting is held. Bradshaw leads
a small team on this one. Ideas from suppliers are evaluated and fed to engineering.
</p>
<p>4:45 p.m.: Bradshaw meets with staff within the procurement function of procurement proj-
ect leaders to get caught up.

<p>facility receives and moves material defines the flow for downstream work centers. If
the receiving process is slow, it can create a bottleneck affecting the entire facility as
well as other facilities requiring material from that location. The process itself may
also contain non-value-adding tasks or waste.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 12.10 reveals that seven different employees take part in the physical re-
ceipt and movement of material. The average time to unload, process, and move mate-
rial from a truck is 215 minutes, which means that, on average, each receiving line
can process and move two trailerloads of material a day. With eight receiving lines,
this process averages 16 truckloads per eight-hour shift.
</p>
<p>As volumes at this company increased, the company faced two options: add a sec-
ond shift or improve the receiving process to make it more efficient. In the short run
it added a second shift as a fix to the receiving capacity problem. A longer-term solu-
tion required a total revamping of the process, which Exhibit 12.11 illustrates. The
new system combined physical system changes with information technology.
</p>
<p>The redesigned system generates move-control tickets automatically once the front
gate of the plant acknowledges the arrival of a truck. Furthermore, the new process oper-
ates concurrently rather than sequentially. The employee unloading the trailer now has
expanded duties. The employee not only unloads the material but also hangs control tick-
ets and resolves receiving discrepancies, which illustrates the benefit of flexibility versus
specialization. These changes reduced the time required to process an inbound trailer by

<p>over 50%, which means that a single shift can now process over twice as many trailers a
day. Material moves faster and the process requires fewer total resources. Until an organi-
zation maps its processes, it cannot realize major improvements.
</p>
<p>The following steps are critical to process mapping:
</p>
<p>&bull; Search for better ways and methods to perform the tasks comprising a pro-
cess, which often involves using information technology to automate transac-
tions within the process.
</p>
<p>&bull; Replace sequential activities with concurrent activities wherever possible.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify those activities that contribute to waste or add minimal value to the
process and target those for elimination.
</p>
<p>&bull; Identify the time associated with each part of a process and identify how
much of that time is waste.

<p>Good Practice
Example
</p>
<p>Lean Takes Off
at Cessna
</p>
<p>Facing a $9 billion backlog, Cessna Aircraft Co. is turning to its supply chain for help
filling the orders. Demand for Cessna&rsquo;s business jets is strong. In 2006, the company deliv-
ered more than 1,200 aircraft and reported revenues of about $4.2 billion, up from $3.5 bil-
lion in 2005.
</p>
<p>The company is growing; it employs more than 13,000 people, versus 8,000 just four years
ago. But, in an effort to be more efficient and competitive around the world, it&rsquo;s also chang-
ing its business model and expanding its lean initiatives. (Lean techniques involve using
and applying a set of tools that assist in the identification and elimination of waste any-
where in the supply chain. Lean programs have a goal of improving productivity and quality
while reducing costs.) Cessna, which historically was vertically integrated, is purchasing
more parts and larger assemblies today than in the past.
</p>
<p>In 2003, buyers were sourcing 48,000 part numbers. Today, this figure is more than 62,000,
with many part numbers representing large assemblies such as an entire tail section of an
airplane. The company buys these parts from 791 suppliers and has long-term agreements
with 280 of them, representing 95% of its $1.8 billion annual spend on direct materials.
</p>
<p>Although Cessna&rsquo;s supply base performs very well, many of the company&rsquo;s suppliers are not
accustomed to providing some of the parts or larger assemblies that the aircraft maker re-
quires, says Brent Edmisten, director of strategic sourcing and integrated supply chain (ISC)
strategies at Cessna in Wichita, Kansas. &ldquo;So we are approaching suppliers we know are
able,&rdquo; Edmisten says, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re going to their facilities to help them develop that
capability.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Cessna Aircraft Co. is a Textron Inc. company. Cessna operates using the Textron Production
System, which is based on the Toyota Production System and other principles, and focuses
on reducing lead time and assets and improving flexibility and customer responsiveness by
eliminating waste. To do this, a supplier participates in value-stream mapping and improve-
ment workshops. These efforts help simplify processes and improve productivity. The ISC oper-

<p>454 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ation (which is the melding of the supply chain and operations functions) has developed a
process for selecting suppliers for development, based on business complexity, risk, and
opportunity.
</p>
<p>Many Cessna suppliers do not fit the model for supplier development. This does not mean
that ISC takes them off the radar screen. For these suppliers, they developed a supplier
value improvement process (SVIP). Through SVIP, Cessna and its suppliers collaborate to
solve quality, delivery, reliability, or cost issues. In essence, these suppliers are performing
well; ISC works with them to take them to the next level.
</p>
<p>Of those suppliers critical to Cessna&rsquo;s ISC strategy&mdash;suppliers with high business complex-
ity, high risk, and high opportunity&mdash;the company selects a group of four to six suppliers for
its development process.
</p>
<p>For Cessna, supplier development is all about knowledge transfer. That is, a commodity team
and others spend time at the supplier&rsquo;s facility to train its personnel on use of such tools as
lean, Six Sigma, and purchasing best practices. With what it&rsquo;s learned, the supplier, in turn,
then works to improve its capabilities on its own.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We teach them to be an extension of our company,&rdquo; says Teresa Kirkendoll, director of sup-
plier integration at Cessna. &ldquo;A key success factor in our supplier development process is the
relationship. It&rsquo;s important that there be trust between us&mdash;before we even get started.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>One such supplier is PZL Swidnik, a provider of welded seat assemblies and engine mounts
based in Poland. Before Cessna selected the supplier, it had been doing this work internally.
</p>
<p>Prior to working with the aircraft maker, PZL Swidnik struggled for years with on-time deliv-
ery and quality performance. Cessna&rsquo;s development efforts &ldquo;had a huge impact on its ability
to take on more work, and to handle the work,&rdquo; says Kirkendoll, adding that ISC helped the
supplier with its processes for building seat frames. Based on success with the parts, the sup-
plier applied what it learned to its processes for engine mounts.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a company in the former Eastern bloc, PZL Swidnik was not used to producing for perfor-
mance,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We spent time on culture, the layout of their facility, and developing
their people. It was the first time they looked at building parts for flow and optimizing for pro-
ductivity and profit.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>One area that Cessna and PZL Swidnik worked to improve: scheduling. In fact, Cessna
learned that some issues the supplier was having were due to the aircraft company sending
a schedule for different amounts of parts each month. Now, it provides a consistent order
schedule, a simple improvement achieved by replacing discrete orders with a level load
process.
</p>
<p>Cessna also worked with the supplier on ways to reduce inventory. &ldquo;We got them together
with one of our other suppliers, a distributor that helped manage their inventory and is now
delivering raw material cut to size when they need it,&rdquo; says Edmisten. &ldquo;It was a huge improve-
ment for their overall business, beyond what they do for Cessna.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Cessna&rsquo;s lean philosophy is passed down to their suppliers&rsquo; suppliers. For example, one sup-
plier, Rockwell Collins, was recognized for outstanding supplier performance in 2005. Rock-
well provides Cessna with avionics components. Rockwell practices lean and has passed
these practices on to FTG, Inc., one of its top suppliers. Rockwell Collins&rsquo; human interface (dis-
plays and keyboards) commodity team, as well as representatives of the company&rsquo;s lean sup-
ply team, traveled to FTG&rsquo;s facility in Toronto to help the supplier reduce its cycle time and
create more flow in its factory. They used such lean tools as 5S events and value stream S

<p>mapping as well as kanban supermarkets&mdash;a system of locating parts at individual work-
stations rather than a central storeroom&mdash;to get more inventory to the point of use for the
company.
</p>
<p>One technique Rockwell Collins used is a spaghetti flow diagram, which essentially follows a
part through the manufacturing process to determine the distance that it travels. The team re-
laid out the process, and, by using the kanban supermarkets, was able to reduce the total dis-
tance traveled by 39% as well as the time it takes to go from one process to another by 24%.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have Rockwell Collins volunteer to provide a facilitator to run us through a lean pro-
gram, and train our people, was a huge benefit to us as a smaller company,&rdquo; says Kerry
Scrase, director of corporate operations for FTG.
</p>
<p>These lean efforts throughout the supply chain have paid off. Cessna&rsquo;s efforts have led to im-
provements in on-time delivery, from 42% to 97%; quality, from 37,732 parts per million
(ppm) to 1,257 ppm; and cost reductions of $1.5 million.

<p>CONCLUSION
Purchasers and supply chain specialists rely on various tools and techniques to sup-
</p>
<p>port and improve the purchasing and sourcing process. The need to routinely apply
the techniques and tools presented in this chapter is critical to world-class purchas-
ing and supply chain management. Wherever possible, decisions should be based on
quantitative analysis rather than qualitative information.

<p>The opening vignette highlights how a supply management professional, using negoti-
ation and contracting practices transferred from an unrelated industry, has created
new value that has enhanced his company&rsquo;s competitiveness. The ability to improve
return on net assets was possible only through extensive planning, negotiation, and
the use of longer-term contracts that combined the requirements of geographically di-
verse operating units. Negotiation is a skill that is essential to all purchasing and sup-
ply managers.
</p>
<p>Creating New Value through Negotiation
</p>
<p>Wayne Delaney is a relative newcomer to the railroad business. That has not stopped
him, however, from using the knowledge and skills gained from his many years at General
Electric to improve the performance of the subsidiary railroads at a major steel producer. So
how did he do it?
</p>
<p>Executive management at the parent steel company directed all operating units (including
the railroads) to concentrate on return on net assets (RONA) as an important performance in-
dicator. Improving RONA forced different functional groups at the railroads to search, both in-
dividually and collectively, for creative ways to increase earnings while simultaneously
reducing assets and other current liabilities. The purchasing group, representing the inter-
ests of five separate railroads, focused on reducing the assets required by the railroads to
maintain track, equipment, and facilities. Inventory makes up a large part of the denomina-
tor of the return on net assets equation.
</p>
<p>The purchasing group&rsquo;s approach to higher asset return relies on negotiated longer-term con-
tracts featuring consignment inventory from suppliers. Inventory consignment involves defer-
ring payment for an item until an internal customer physically uses it. Previously, each
railroad purchased its own requirements using short-term purchase orders.
</p>
<p>Although the five railroads operate as separate entities, Wayne works directly with each rail-
road to develop and negotiate systemwide contracts. Purchasing identifies potential items for
long-term contracts, identifies and analyzes potential suppliers, creates benchmark prices to
compare final prices against, calculates annual demand requirements, and represents the in-
terests of each railroad during negotiations with suppliers.
</p>
<p>Each railroad has an opportunity to present its specific needs before purchasing enters a ne-
gotiation. Internal customers at each site electronically receive a generic contract before a
supplier negotiation. The railroads have an opportunity to identify the contractual options
they prefer, and users can expand the contract by listing any items they would like to see ad-
dressed in final negotiations.
</p>
<p>Has Wayne&rsquo;s approach to contracting and negotiation been successful? Over a three-year pe-
riod, current inventory maintained by the railroads has decreased by over 50%. Longer-term
agreements have also allowed for some downsizing at the railroads because suppliers have
assumed responsibilities previously performed by the railroads, such as delivering and plac-
ing physical inventory in storage. Furthermore, the railroads have realized price reductions
due to the combining of common purchase requirements. Overall, the railroads now achieve
a 35% return on net assets, prompting some at the railroad to joke that perhaps the rail-
road should divest itself of the parent steel company, which has failed to achieve its own op-
erating goals.

<p>460 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Everyone negotiates something every day, ranging from dealing with other drivers
at a four-way stop sign all the way to merging with or acquiring another company.
As such, negotiation is generally a highly complex and dynamic process, and many
books and articles have been written on how to effectively negotiate in a variety of sit-
uations. This chapter highlights important topics that are typically part of any negotia-
tion, especially those between buyers and suppliers. We begin this chapter by broadly
defining the concept of negotiation. The second section presents negotiation as a
five-phase process. Next, perhaps the most important part of any negotiation process&mdash;
planning&mdash;appears in detail. The following sections present common sources of negotia-
tion power, the effective use of concessions, negotiation strategies and tactics, and the
important topics of win-win negotiation, international negotiation, and the effect of the
Internet on the future of negotiation.
</p>
<p>What Is Negotiation?
One of the most important activities performed by supply managers involves nego-
</p>
<p>tiating agreements or contracts with their suppliers. Although supply management is
certainly not the only group in an organization that negotiates, negotiation is a vital
part of every sourcing process. Negotiation is an ideal way to implement the supply
management strategies and plans that a business unit develops. It is also often an
ideal way to convey the buyer&rsquo;s specific sourcing requirements and specifications to

<p>American Airlines Knows
the Importance of
Negotiation
</p>
<p>In a previous era, the sign of a good purchase negotiator was someone who could get
a rock-bottom price from suppliers. Today, experienced negotiators realize that not all negotia-
tions require a price focus or the same set of skills. &ldquo;Low-level negotiations,&rdquo; says John
MacLean, vice president of purchasing with American Airlines, &ldquo;involve products or services
that are competitive in the marketplace but are not strategically important to American Air-
lines.&rdquo; He points out that getting the best price is a good indicator of effectiveness for these
types of items. MacLean also knows the importance of strategic negotiations when obtaining
critical items and services. &ldquo;Win/win negotiations,&rdquo; says MacLean, &ldquo;are conducted in long-
term relationships with suppliers. In these cases it is important that the supplier and Ameri-
can Airlines feel they are getting a good deal because the plan is to work together for a long
while.&rdquo; At the most advanced level, the strategic compatibility of the companies involved
may determine the success of a negotiation. Says MacLean, &ldquo;Principle-based negotiating is
used in a single-source situation or alliance where the two parties begin the negotiation by
agreeing to certain principles, such as how the companies plan to grow together.&rdquo; American
Airlines recognizes two important principles about negotiation. First, not all negotiations are
equal in importance or require the same skill set. Second, negotiation is a fundamental part
of the company&rsquo;s strategic supply plans.

<p>Negotiation has been defined in a variety of ways: &ldquo;A negotiation is an interactive
communication process that may take place whenever we want something from some-
one else or another person wants something from us.&rdquo;1 &ldquo;Negotiation is the process of
communicating back and forth for the purpose of reaching a joint agreement about
differing needs or ideas.&rdquo;2 &ldquo;Negotiation is a decision-making process by which two or
more people agree how to allocate scarce resources.&rdquo;3 &ldquo;Negotiating is the end game
of the sales process.&rdquo;4
</p>
<p>For our purposes, we define negotiation as a process of formal communication, ei-
ther face-to-face or via electronic means, where two or more people come together to
seek mutual agreement about an issue or issues. The negotiation process involves the
management of time, information, and power between individuals and organizations
who are interdependent. Each party has a need for something that the other party
has, yet recognizes that an interactive process of compromise or concession is often re-
quired to satisfy that need.
</p>
<p>An important part of negotiation is realizing that the process involves relation-
ships between people, not just organizations. A central part of negotiation involves
each party trying to persuade the other party to do something that is in its best inter-
est. The process involves skills that individuals, with the proper training and experi-
ence, can learn and improve upon. Good negotiators are not born; they hone these
necessary skills through planning and practice.
</p>
<p>There are a number of terms with which all negotiators should be familiar:
BATNA, positions, interests, needs, and wants. A negotiator&rsquo;s best alternative to a ne-
gotiated agreement (BATNA) is also known as the negotiator&rsquo;s bottom line or reserva-
tion point, that is, that point in the negotiation where it is most advantageous for the
negotiator to walk away from the table and implement his or her next-best option.5
</p>
<p>A negotiator should take extra caution to ensure that his or her reservation point or
BATNA is never revealed to the other party because the final settlement is unlikely
to vary much from that point.6 In addition, all negotiation settlements must ulti-
mately be judged in light of the other viable alternatives that existed at the time of
the agreement.
</p>
<p>A negotiator&rsquo;s position can be defined as his or her opening offer, which represents
the optimistic (or ideal) value of the issue being negotiated. A position is the stated de-
mand that is placed on the table by a negotiator. In contrast, the negotiator&rsquo;s interest
is the unspoken motivation or reason that underlies any given negotiation position.
In many negotiation scenarios, the negotiator&rsquo;s underlying interests are unlikely to be
expressly stated or acknowledged, oftentimes because they may not be directly ger-
mane to the stated position or may be personal in nature. Sharing the underlying in-
terests behind a position may cause a negotiator&rsquo;s power to shift toward the other
party, resulting in a less-than-desired outcome. The negotiator must, in effect, play de-
tective to try and discern the other party&rsquo;s interests through a series of open-ended,
probing questions. In order to reach a negotiated agreement using principled negotia-
tion, a negotiator should always attempt to focus on the other party&rsquo;s underlying inter-
ests, not his or her stated position.7
</p>
<p>The astute negotiator must also be able to distinguish between the other party&rsquo;s
needs and wants. Needs are considered to be those negotiated outcomes that the nego-
tiator must have in order to reach a successful outcome to the negotiation. Wants, on

<p>the other hand, refer to those negotiated outcomes that a negotiator would like to
have as opposed to those outcomes that must be achieved. Wants can also be ex-
changed as concessions to the other party during a negotiation because they are not
as critical to achieving a successful conclusion to the negotiation. When a negotiator
is planning an upcoming negotiation, it is imperative to prioritize all of the potential
issues to be negotiated into needs and wants, thereby knowing what must be
achieved and what can be exchanged for something else of value.
</p>
<p>A simple negotiation planning tool, called &ldquo;Triangle Talk,&rdquo; can help the negotiator
begin the initial preparation for an upcoming negotiation. This planning process,
shown in Exhibit 13.1, consists of the following three steps: (1) know exactly what
you want; (2) find out what they want and make them feel heard; and (3) propose ac-
tion in such a way that they can accept it.8
</p>
<p>Step 1 in Triangle Talk is determining and formalizing the negotiator&rsquo;s specific
goals and objectives for the upcoming negotiation. Being specific with one&rsquo;s expecta-
tions and writing them down helps the negotiator to remain focused on his or her pre-
determined priorities during the negotiation. Having them written down also allows
the negotiator to refer back to them during the course of the negotiation, when it is of-
ten easy to be distracted by the other negotiator&rsquo;s tactics and the pace of the give-
and-take process. The more clearly a negotiator can define his or her priorities, the
more likely he or she is to obtain them in the final agreement.
</p>
<p>Step 2 involves trying to discern what the negotiator&rsquo;s counterpart is likely to need
or want from the negotiation. It is difficult to develop common ground in the negotia-
tion without knowing what the other party is seeking. Ask specifically, &ldquo;What does
the other party need or want?&rdquo; Delve into the other party&rsquo;s likely positions and try to

<p>estimate what the underlying interests are behind the positions. However, a negotia-
tor cannot automatically assume that the other party thinks the same way he or she
does. During the negotiation, the negotiator can ask open-ended, probing questions
to verify his or her preliminary analysis of the other party&rsquo;s needs and wants. In addi-
tion, the negotiator should develop a strategy and accompanying tactics that will
make the other party feel heard. This will allow the third step in Triangle Talk to
take place.
</p>
<p>Step 3 involves the consideration and analysis of the negotiator&rsquo;s own needs and
wants and the needs and wants of the other party. This way, proposals and counter-
proposals can be offered that take both sets of needs and wants into account and are
framed in such a way as to make it easy for the other party to say &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It is im-
portant to remain flexible, fair, and reasonable so that the parties can work out an
agreement in which they are both better off. In addition to acknowledging (but not
necessarily agreeing with) the other party&rsquo;s concerns, the negotiator can accomplish
this by speaking to those needs first when framing his or her proposals.
</p>
<p>Negotiation Framework
Perhaps the best way to approach a buyer-supplier negotiation is by presenting it
</p>
<p>as an interactive, give-and-take process involving five major phases:
</p>
<p>1. Identify or anticipate a purchase requirement
</p>
<p>2. Determine if negotiation is required
</p>
<p>3. Plan for the negotiation
</p>
<p>4. Conduct the negotiation
</p>
<p>5. Execute the agreement
</p>
<p>Exhibit 13.2 summarizes this general negotiation process.
</p>
<p>Identify or Anticipate a Purchase Requirement
The purchasing cycle begins with identifying or anticipating a purchase require-
</p>
<p>ment. Chapter 2 addresses how firms identify or anticipate purchase requirements, or
what we typically call the purchasing process. The purchasing cycle begins with identi-
fying (or anticipating) a material need or requirement for a component, raw mate-
rial, subassembly, service, piece of equipment, or finished product. Often, supply
management can identify new requirements during new-product development in col-
laboration with its various internal customers within the buying organization, such as
marketing, operations, design, and research and development. For many existing
items, there may not be a need to identify a supplier because an existing sourcing
agreement may already be in place. New sourcing requirements, however, often re-
quire supply management to identify, evaluate, and qualify new potential suppliers.
</p>
<p>Determine If Negotiation Is Required
Not all purchase requirements will require buyers and sellers to conduct a thor-
</p>
<p>ough and detailed negotiation. For many items, the competitive bidding process will
satisfy a buyer&rsquo;s purchase requirements, as may be the case for items that are low
value, are widely available commodities, or have pre-existing standards. Negotiation
is often appropriate when other issues besides price are important or when competi-

<p>tive bidding will not satisfy the buyer&rsquo;s purchase requirements on various issues. How-
ever, a buyer can still use a competitive bidding process to identify several potential
sources of supply. After identifying a potential supplier through bidding, the buyer
may need to negotiate with the preferred supplier to resolve other non-price issues af-
fecting the sourcing agreement.
</p>
<p>The following areas or issues may require supply management to negotiate with
its suppliers:
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification of and agreement on a supplier&rsquo;s allowable costs
</p>
<p>&bull; Delivery schedules and lead time requirements
</p>
<p>&bull; Expected product and service quality levels

</p>
<p>This list, although lengthy, is not exhaustive and represents only a portion of the
topics that negotiators can address. Besides the need to agree on non-price issues,
other reasons exist for negotiating with suppliers:
</p>
<p>&bull; The total contract value or volume is large. It is not unusual for supply man-
agers to negotiate contracts worth millions of dollars. Nonperformance on
large contracts can cause unusually severe problems, such as an interruption
in continuity of supply. The buyer may want to negotiate special safeguards
to make sure the supplier recognizes the importance of performing exactly
as required.
</p>
<p>&bull; The purchase involves complex technical requirements, perhaps even product
and process requirements and specifications that are still evolving. Under this
condition, it is difficult for the parties to reach definitive agreement on a pur-
chase requirement. However, a buyer may want the supplier to begin work
even if final product requirements and specifications have not yet been
established.
</p>
<p>&bull; The purchase involves capital-intensive plant and equipment. Suppliers often
customize or dedicate capital-intensive plant and equipment to meet a buy-
er&rsquo;s specific needs.
</p>
<p>&bull; The agreement involves a special or collaborative relationship. Special or col-
laborative relationships must address issues beyond a traditional or conven-
tional purchase agreement. For example, the two parties may discuss the
joint development of technology featuring the sharing or co-location of tech-
nical personnel.
</p>
<p>&bull; The supplier will perform important value-added activities. Increasingly, buy-
ers are asking suppliers to perform activities such as product design, testing,
or inventory management. These additional activities often require substan-
tial discussion and negotiation to determine appropriate compensation and
how performance is to be measured.

<p>466 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>An important question for the supply manager today is how much will the develop-
ment of information technology systems, such as Internet-based reverse auctions and
use of electronic-based communication media, change the need to negotiate or have
face-to-face interaction with suppliers? The use of reverse auctions has likely reduced
the need for face-to-face interaction or negotiation between buyers and sellers. How-
ever, it also likely that the type of items and services obtained through reverse auc-
tions (e.g., standard commodities with a moderate total dollar spend) do not warrant
higher-level negotiations in the first place. For items that are critical to the buyer or in-
volve many non-price issues, the likelihood that buyers and sellers will no longer en-
gage in face-to-face negotiation is small. See Sourcing Snapshot: Will E-Procurement
Change Negotiation? for a discussion on how electronic communication media can
affect negotiations conducted at a distance.
</p>
<p>Plan for the Negotiation
Negotiation planning involves a series of steps that prepare the parties for a forth-
</p>
<p>coming negotiation. Many buyer-supplier negotiations are relatively straightforward
and may require only basic preparation and planning. Other negotiations may be
highly complex and require months of thorough and detailed preparation. Regard-
less, supply managers who take the time necessary to plan and prepare for a negotia-
tion will usually experience better outcomes than those negotiators who do not
adequately plan and prepare. Planning is so crucial to achieving desired negotiation
outcomes that a later section addresses this topic in greater detail.
</p>
<p>New electronic communications technology may make face-to face buyer-supplier
negotiation, both for domestic and international requirements, far less necessary.

<p>Will E-Procurement
Change Negotiation?
</p>
<p>As the number of people buying online continues to grow, certain changes are in store
for supply management professionals who have traditionally prided themselves on their face-
to-face people skills. Kevin Rohan, a purchasing specialist at JP Cannon Associates in New
York, believes being a strong negotiator is not enough in today&rsquo;s market. Candidates need to
continue to develop their skills and be familiar with the latest technology such as how to
use the Internet, identify market changes, and perform strategic planning. However, the
chances that e-procurement will completely replace one-on-one negotiation in the near future
are slim. Emery J. Zobro, president of the John Michael Personnel Group in Chattanooga, TN,
is confident that, while the characteristics of a successful supply management professional
might change over time, certain qualities will survive e-procurement&rsquo;s infiltration of the
industry. &ldquo;In five years a person who hasn&rsquo;t established a track record with e-commerce and
e-procurement will definitely be left behind,&rdquo; Zobro says. Nevertheless, he remains firm in
the assessment that &ldquo;buying things over the computer will never take the place of one-on-
one negotiations.&rdquo;

<p>This can be a very attractive alternative to expensive and time-consuming interna-
tional travel as more organizations engage in global supply management, which cre-
ates a host of new negotiation challenges. It will also substantially change how a
supply manager plans for and conducts the negotiation.
</p>
<p>More advanced online communication tools are becoming readily available that
feature the ability to negotiate issues beyond price with multiple suppliers, regardless
of their physical location. With these tools, e-procurement managers no longer have
to spend hours in face-to-face meetings arguing over details with suppliers. A buyer
simply fills out a predetermined request for proposal (RFP) or request for quotation
(RFQ) template and then forwards the document electronically to a select group of
its qualified suppliers.9 Suppliers can then easily and quickly respond electronically
with detailed online proposals outlining price, payment terms, shipping methods, or
any other issue that is relevant to the buyer. It is also much easier to make changes
as the negotiation process progresses. These tools enable a buyer to negotiate simulta-
neously with more than one supplier during this process, which leads to greater bid-
ding efficiencies and lower prices through increased competition (similar to reverse
auctions).
</p>
<p>Conduct the Negotiation
Negotiations with a supplier should occur only when a buyer feels confident about
</p>
<p>the level of planning and preparation put forth. However, planning is not an open-
ended process; buyers must usually meet deadlines that satisfy the needs of internal
customers within the buyer&rsquo;s organization. Thus, the buyer faces pressure to initiate,
conduct, and conclude the negotiation within a reasonable time. Effective planning
also requires hard work on the following points:
</p>
<p>&bull; Defining the issues
</p>
<p>&bull; Assembling issues and defining the bargaining mix
</p>
<p>&bull; Defining interests
</p>
<p>&bull; Defining one&rsquo;s own objectives (targets) and opening bids (where to begin)
</p>
<p>&bull; Assessing constituents and the social context in which the negotiation will
occur
</p>
<p>&bull; Analyzing the other party
</p>
<p>&bull; Planning the issue presentation and defense
</p>
<p>&bull; Defining protocols: where and when the negotiation will occur, who will be
there, what the agenda will be, and so on10
</p>
<p>Deciding where to negotiate can be an important part of the planning process. A
home location can provide a substantial advantage to a negotiator, particularly dur-
ing international negotiations. Advances in telecommunication technology now allow
some negotiations to occur electronically rather than face-to-face. Most experts agree
that the atmosphere surrounding a negotiation should be less formal wherever possi-
ble to build trusting relationships and long-term commitment.
</p>
<p>Excessive formality can effectively constrain the parties and restrict the free ex-
change of ideas and solutions. It is also a good idea to summarize positions and
points of agreement throughout the negotiation, which helps reduce misunderstand-
ing while helping track progress against the negotiation agenda. It may also help to
have a dedicated note taker or scribe throughout the negotiation whose primary

<p>responsibility is to record what was said, who said it, what the other party&rsquo;s reaction
was, and what the areas of agreement were.
</p>
<p>It is during the negotiation that the parties play out their strategy with tactics&mdash;the
skill of employing available means to accomplish or achieve a desired end. Tactics are
the action plans designed to help achieve a desired result. A later section reviews vari-
ous common tactics that negotiators may employ or should be prepared for.
</p>
<p>A sequence of four phases often characterizes face-to-face negotiation sessions.
The first consists of fact finding and information sharing between the parties. This
part of the process helps clarify and confirm information provided by the buyer and
seller. During the second phase, the parties often take a recess after fact finding. This
allows each party the opportunity to reassess relative strengths and weaknesses, re-
view and revise objectives and positions if necessary, and organize the negotiation
agenda. Next, the negotiating parties meet face-to-face in an attempt to narrow their
differences on the specific issues. This phase typically includes the offering of propo-
sals and counterproposals and exchanging concessions. Finally, the parties seek an
agreement and conclusion to the negotiation, plus establish any agreed-upon follow-
on activities.
</p>
<p>Effective negotiators typically display certain behaviors or characteristics when con-
ducting a negotiation. They may be willing to compromise or revise their goals, partic-
ularly when new information effectively challenges their predetermined position.
Effective negotiators may also view issues independently, without linking them in any
particular sequence. Linking issues risks undermining an entire negotiation if the par-
ties reach an impasse on a single issue within the negotiation package. Effective nego-
tiators should also establish lower and upper ranges for each major issue, as opposed
to a single, rigid position that may limit the number of viable options available and
be more likely to create an impasse.
</p>
<p>Highly effective or skilled negotiators explore more options per issue than do aver-
age negotiators. Furthermore, effective negotiators also make more comments about
the common ground between the parties (rather than the differences) than do aver-
age negotiators. Finally, when compared with average negotiators, effective or skilled
negotiators make fewer irritating comments about the other party, give fewer reasons
for arguments they advance (too many supporting reasons can dilute an argument),
and make fewer counterproposals. Effective negotiators are willing to make counter-
proposals, though not as many as an average negotiator. A willingness to make too
many counterproposals means the negotiator is probably compromising too much or
offering too many concessions. It may also indicate a lack of adequate planning and
preparation or a sign of vulnerability.
</p>
<p>Execute the Agreement
Reaching agreement is not the end of the negotiation process by any means.
</p>
<p>Rather, an agreement merely represents the beginning of the contract&rsquo;s performance
for the item, service, or activity covered by the agreement. An important part of exe-
cuting and following through on a negotiated agreement is loading the agreement
into a corporate contract system so others throughout the organization have visibility
of the agreement.
</p>
<p>During the life of an agreement, a buyer must let a supplier know if the supplier is
not meeting its contractual requirements. Conversely, it is the supplier&rsquo;s responsibil-
ity to let the buyer know if the buyer is not meeting its responsibilities within the

<p>negotiated agreement. Both parties should work to build upon the success of a negotia-
tion. Carrying out the agreement as agreed upon should reaffirm the commitment of
the parties to work together in the future.
</p>
<p>Negotiation Planning
Experts on negotiation generally agree that planning is perhaps the single most im-
</p>
<p>portant part of the negotiation process. Unfortunately, many negotiators fail to prepare
properly before entering into a formal negotiation. A plan is a method or scheme de-
vised for making or doing something to achieve a desired end. Planning, therefore, is the
process of devising methods to achieve a desired end. Once negotiators develop their
plan and an overall guiding strategy, they can begin to develop the specific actions and
tactics necessary to carry out that plan. Negotiators frequently fall short of their goals
or reach an impasse because they neglect the other party&rsquo;s problems, focus too much
on price, focus on positions instead of interests, focus too much on common ground,
neglect their BATNAs, or overadjust their perceptions during the actual negotiation.11
</p>
<p>At least 90% of the successful outcomes of any negotiation are determined by effec-
tive planning. Preparing at the last minute just prior to a negotiation is a sure recipe for
disaster, especially when negotiating against someone who is far more prepared. There-
fore, being quick and clever while thinking on one&rsquo;s feet is simply insufficient to ensure
a successful negotiation outcome. Successful negotiation planning is proactive, not reac-
tive, and consists of the following nine steps, none of which should be passed over.
</p>
<p>Develop Specific Objectives
The first step of the negotiation planning process involves developing specific goals
</p>
<p>and objectives desired from the negotiation. An objective is an aspiration or vision to
work toward in the future. For example, an obvious objective in a sourcing negotiation
would be to reach an agreement that covers the purchase of a good or service. Neither
a buyer nor a seller would commit scarce resources if the goal were to see a negotiation
fail. Before actual negotiations begin, the parties need to believe they can reach an agree-
ment. If the parties believed otherwise, they would not put forth the requisite time and
effort to prepare for and conduct a successful negotiation.
</p>
<p>An important objective during a sourcing negotiation is to reach agreement on a
fair and reasonable price between a buyer and seller. Examples of buyer objectives
could include achieving an acceptable unit price, required delivery lead time, or im-
proved supplier quality in terms of defect levels. The buyer may also want to per-
suade the supplier to collaborate with the buyer at a level higher than other
competing buyers would receive. Not all objectives are equally important, so the
buyer must begin to identify the importance of each one and prioritize them depend-
ing on the negotiation at hand. One leading company separates its objectives into
&ldquo;must have&rdquo; and &ldquo;would like to have&rdquo; categories. This begins to differentiate the im-
portance of each objective.
</p>
<p>Analyze Each Party&rsquo;s Strengths and Weaknesses
Knowledgeable negotiators strive to understand their counterparts through research
</p>
<p>and experience. This means understanding what is important to the other company
along with understanding the personality and history of the negotiator&rsquo;s opposite

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>number. For example, when buyers negotiate with a supplier for the first time, they
must often commit substantial time and energy to additional research in order to more
fully understand that particular supplier and its needs, wants, and priorities.
</p>
<p>Analyzing the other party requires a thorough assessment of the relative strengths
and weaknesses of the parties, as well as each individual issue to be negotiated. This
due diligence process can greatly influence the effectiveness of the strategy and tactics
employed at the bargaining table. Buyers cannot assume that they have power or influ-
ence over the supplier or vice versa. Many times a supplier holds a power position
over the buyer because of its financial size, or perhaps because the supplier does not
have a great need for the contract. A later section details various sources of power
that are part of the negotiation process.
</p>
<p>Gather Relevant Information
The ability to analyze yourself and your negotiating counterpart requires suffi-
</p>
<p>cient, timely, and accurate information. This process need not be complex, particu-
larly if the buyer and seller have previously negotiated together. When this is the
case, the buyer may have already answered a number of important questions. What
happened between the parties? Were we satisfied with the previous outcome of the ne-
gotiation? Are we negotiating with the same people or different negotiators? What
are the important issues to this supplier? To us? What were the areas of disagree-
ment? Is there anything about the rules of the negotiation we would like to change?
</p>
<p>Where does a buyer, who has no experience with a supplier, gather the required in-
formation? One possible source may be contacting others who have experience with
that supplier. Published sources of information may also be available. These sources
include trade journals, other business publications, trade association data, govern-
ment reports, annual reports, financial evaluations (such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet re-
ports), commercial databases, inquiries directly to personnel at the supplier, and
information derived through the Internet.
</p>
<p>Recognize Your Counterpart&rsquo;s Needs
The buyer and seller in a sourcing negotiation are, in many ways, mirror images
</p>
<p>of each other. Each side wants to reach an agreement that is favorable to its longer-
term success. As a buyer gathers information about a supplier, it is important to iden-
tify those key issues that are particularly critical to the supplier. For example, a sup-
plier may want to maintain or grow its market share and volume in its industry.
Therefore, receiving the entire purchase contract, rather than only a portion, may be
an important objective to that supplier.
</p>
<p>The issues that are most critical to a supplier are not likely to be those most criti-
cal to a buyer. When one party has an issue or requirement that is relatively unimpor-
tant to the other, then the parties are more likely to reach agreement. For example, a
supplier&rsquo;s production scheduling system may require the supplier to produce a buy-
er&rsquo;s requirement late in the day with delivery during the evening. If a buyer has an
evening work crew that can easily receive late deliveries, the buyer can satisfy the sup-
plier&rsquo;s requirement for later deliveries. In return, the buyer may now expect the sup-
plier to be more accommodating on one or more issues that are important to the
buyer. Give and take is essential to negotiation, and each party should not expect to
prevail on all issues. This is why it is important for buyers to do their homework

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>before the negotiation begins by identifying ranges of acceptable outcomes for each
and every issue and setting priorities in the event that concessions or tradeoffs are
required.
</p>
<p>Identify Facts and Issues
Negotiation planning requires differentiating between facts and issues. The two par-
</p>
<p>ties will want to reach agreement early concerning what constitutes a fact versus an is-
sue. A fact is a reality or truth that the parties can easily state and verify or prove. In
negotiation, facts are not open to debate. For example, a buyer wants to purchase a
piece of capital equipment. There is no negotiating with a supplier on whether the
buyer actually needs that particular piece of equipment (although the specific type of
equipment may be an unanswered question requiring interactive discussion).
</p>
<p>Issues, on the other hand, are items or topics to be resolved during the negotia-
tion. Issues that might require resolution include purchase price and delivery date.
The parties to a negotiation can discuss and resolve many issues besides price, includ-
ing quality, delivery, service, metrics, and performance improvement. Part of the plan-
ning process requires identifying all of the critical issues and outcomes that each
party seeks to resolve through the negotiation. As discussed earlier, the Triangle Talk
technique can help negotiators determine not only the issues involved but the range
of acceptable outcomes for each issue.
</p>
<p>Establish a Position on Each Issue
The parties to a negotiation should establish positions that offer flexibility. Negotia-
</p>
<p>tors should therefore develop a range of positions&mdash;typically, a minimum acceptable
position (or BATNA), a maximum or ideal outcome, and a most likely position. If
the issue is price, a seller may have a target price for which it wants to sell a product.
Of course, the seller will take a higher price if the buyer is willing to offer one. The
critical part of the range will be based on the seller&rsquo;s minimum acceptable price or re-
sistance point. This is the lowest price at which the seller is willing to sell to a buyer.
Any price lower than the minimum will result in no deal or an unacceptable out-
come to the supplier. The area of overlapping positions among issues, when there is
one, is termed the bargaining or settlement zone.12 The bargaining zone represents the
heart of the negotiation process, as any proposal offered outside of this range is likely
to be rejected by the other party because it is less than what he or she is willing to set-
tle for.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 13.3 demonstrates a settlement zone for a typical purchase price&ndash;based ne-
gotiation. Looking at example A, the parties will probably not reach agreement un-
less one or both parties modify their original price range or position. The minimum
selling position of the seller is far above the buyer&rsquo;s maximum position, with no over-
lap. In example B, there is an overlap between the two positions that should lead to
an agreement. The buyer is willing to pay up to $11.45 per unit. The supplier is will-
ing to sell as low as $11.15 per unit. The two parties will likely reach an agreement
somewhere between those two figures. As a bargaining tactic, the buyer may open
with an offer to purchase at something less than $11.00 (that is, start out very low).
However, if the seller remains with its original plan, the negotiation will likely con-
clude within the overlap range.
</p>
<p>Several factors influence whether a party modifies or even abandons its original po-
sition. These include the desire for the contract, the revelation of new or improved

<p>information that challenges the accuracy and credibility of the party&rsquo;s original posi-
tion, or a major concession that leads the other party to modify its position on an-
other issue for the sake of reciprocation.
</p>
<p>Develop the Negotiation Strategy
and Accompanying Tactics
</p>
<p>Negotiation strategy refers to the overall approach used to reach a mutually benefi-
cial agreement with a supplier that holds different points of view from the buyer. A
major part of the strategic planning process involves the application of tactics&mdash;the
art or skill of employing available means to accomplish an end, objective, or strategy.
They include the current set of action plans and activities adopted to achieve the nego-
tiation objectives and strategy. A later section discusses the effective use of tactics in
greater detail.
</p>
<p>Strategic negotiation issues involve the broader questions regarding who, what,
where, when, and how to negotiate. We can think of strategy and tactics as two dimen-
sions of the same negotiation process. The ideal situation is to have a well-developed
negotiation strategy with appropriate and ethical tactics that support that strategy. As
an analogy, consider a military battle. The best-developed strategy will fail unless a
commander has the tactics and the resources to implement that strategy in the field.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Brief Other Personnel
A purchase negotiation usually affects other parties throughout the organization.
</p>
<p>The individual or team conducting the negotiation should adequately brief these inter-
nal stakeholders to ensure that they are aware of and in agreement with the desired
objectives for the negotiation. This briefing should also address the major issues of
the negotiation and the organization&rsquo;s positions on these issues. Briefing personnel
before a negotiation helps eliminate unwanted surprises during and following face-
to-face negotiation. Oftentimes, it is important to garner stakeholder buy-in to the
negotiation through this briefing process to ensure that the negotiation outcomes are
implemented as agreed upon at the bargaining table.
</p>
<p>Practice the Negotiation
Experienced negotiators often practice or rehearse before commencing a formal ne-
</p>
<p>gotiation, especially if the negotiation involves a large dollar amount or is highly criti-
cal to the success of the organization. One way to do this is to hold a mock or
simulated negotiation. For instance, a marketing representative or salesperson might
represent the supplier. The counterpart in a practice negotiation session may be able
to raise questions and issues that the buyer had not originally considered. When
using simulation, it is important for each party to play its role as realistically as
possible.
</p>
<p>Another effective way to conduct a mock negotiation is for the buyer to role-play
the supplier&rsquo;s side. This allows the buyer to empathize with the supplier and more
fully understand how the supplier might approach the negotiation; it also could pro-
vide valuable insight into the supplier&rsquo;s expected needs and wants. Here again, the
use of Triangle Talk can play a valuable role in this key planning process.
</p>
<p>Effective planning means that buyers achieve an agreement that is more creative
and valuable than one that might be available to their competitors. It also means man-
aging the buyer-supplier relationships that support future negotiation and coopera-
tive interaction between the parties.
</p>
<p>Power in Negotiation
An important part of the negotiation process involves the recognition and analysis
</p>
<p>of the relative power relationship that exists between parties. Power is the ability to in-
fluence another person or organization. &ldquo;A&rdquo; has power over &ldquo;B&rdquo; if &ldquo;A&rdquo; can get &ldquo;B&rdquo; to
do something that directly benefits &ldquo;A.&rdquo; Throughout human history, we have seen
both positive and negative uses of power. As such, power, in and of itself, possesses
neither a positive nor a negative connotation; it is how that relative power is used
that gives it a particular perception. Within negotiation, the use of power employed
by the parties can dramatically influence the actual outcome of a negotiation or even
result in a stalemate.
</p>
<p>Both individuals and organizations bring different sources of power to the negotia-
tion table, and the consideration of power should be a part of any negotiation strat-
egy. Some types of power are detrimental to a continued relationship, whereas others
are the result of expertise or access to information. Therefore, negotiators must under-
stand the advantages and disadvantages of using each source of power. They must
also understand the possible effects that using a particular source of power will have
on the relationship between the parties.

<p>474 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Sources of Negotiation Power
Researchers have identified six general types of power exercised by individuals or
</p>
<p>organizations: (1) informational, (2) reward, (3) coercive, (4) legitimate, (5) expert,
and (6) referent.13
</p>
<p>Informational Power
Ready access to relevant and useful information is typically the most common ap-
</p>
<p>plication of power found in a negotiation. It relies on influencing the other party
through the presentation of facts, data, and persuasive arguments to support one&rsquo;s
own positions and to mitigate or challenge the other party&rsquo;s positions. However, the
effective use of information in a negotiation does not necessarily mean open and com-
plete sharing. For example, one party may present only favorable information that
supports its position, whereas the other side may present only negative information
to refute a position. One party often manipulates information, as a source of power,
to control or constrain the options available to the other party.14
</p>
<p>Reward Power
Reward power means that one party is able to offer something of perceived value
</p>
<p>to the other party, such as a purchase contract or access to a new source of technol-
ogy. Using rewards represents a direct attempt to exert control over the negotiation,
particularly when compared with the use of informational power, which relies more
on persuasion. The basis of reward power is the belief that individuals respond and
behave accordingly when valued rewards are available. An important risk of reward
power is that a negotiation counterpart may eventually learn to respond positively
only when offered rewards.
</p>
<p>Coercive Power
Coercive and reward power are somewhat related; they are two sides of the same
</p>
<p>negotiation coin. If one party can give the other party something of value (reward
power), then that party can also take it away (coercive power). Therefore, coercive
power includes the ability to punish the other party&mdash;financially, physically, or men-
tally. Note that repeated use of coercive power can have damaging effects on longer-
term relationships. There is also a strong likelihood that retaliation or escalation can
occur if the power structure shifts unfavorably in the future. For example, when sup-
ply markets begin to tighten during an economic recovery, suppliers may retaliate
against the buyer by pursuing large price increases, not providing excellent service to
certain buyers, or even disrupting continuity of supply to the offending buyer.
</p>
<p>Legitimate Power
The job position that an individual holds, rather than the individual him- or herself,
</p>
<p>is the basis of legitimate power. Parents, pastors, managers, and political officeholders
are examples of individuals possessing legitimate power. In sourcing, a buyer may have
legitimate power simply because he or she legally represents a prominent company and
has the authority to buy. It is not necessarily the case that individuals with legitimate
power have reward or coercive power (e.g., a church pastor).

<p>Expert Power
Expert power is a related and special form of informational power. Successful appli-
</p>
<p>cation of informational and expert power involves the development and retention of
a body of knowledge. Informational power exists when someone has thoroughly re-
searched and prepared for a negotiation. An expert is recognized as having accumu-
lated and mastered vast knowledge about a particular subject, often with verifiable
credentials to document that mastery. Expert power can influence others in a negotia-
tion by reducing the likelihood that another party will be able to successfully refute
the expert&rsquo;s position. Furthermore, nonexperts are less likely to challenge an expert be-
cause of the expert&rsquo;s perceived depth of knowledge. However, the other party must
value the expertise in order for it to be effective.
</p>
<p>Referent Power
This source of power comes from attraction based on socially acceptable personal
</p>
<p>qualities and attributes of an individual, such as one&rsquo;s personality. These qualities
could be physical but likely include individual characteristics such as honesty,
charisma, friendliness, and sensitivity. In this source of power, the power holder&mdash;the
referent&mdash;has some attributes or personal qualities that attract the other party or
make him or her want to be like or respect the power holder. The basis of referent
power is that the nonreferent wants the referent to look favorably upon him or her.
Referent power is most successful in negotiation when the referents are aware that a
counterpart identifies with or has an attraction to them.
</p>
<p>Parties holding power will likely apply all available types of power to their advan-
tage during a negotiation. Negotiators must be careful not to abuse their power, or
they risk damaging relationships, inviting retaliation, or diminishing the value of that
power. In most negotiations, the sources of power that are usually the most effective
are legitimate, informational, and expert. They are usually the sources of power that
allow the parties to maintain a positive relationship after reaching agreement. How-
ever, referent power can also synergistically interact with the other sources of power,
making them stronger or more effective in the influence process.
</p>
<p>Concessions
A fundamental part of every negotiation process involves the offering and ex-
</p>
<p>change of concessions&mdash;movements away from a negotiating position that offer
something of value to the other party. For example, a buyer&rsquo;s willingness to offer
$8.50 per unit instead of $8.25 is a concession that favors the supplier. Effective nego-
tiators quickly learn to offer concessions that have little value to themselves in ex-
change for concessions by the other party that do have perceived value. To make the
negotiation process work, each party must recognize that the give and take of conces-
sions is a normal and necessary part of any negotiation. Buyers, however, will still
want to minimize how much they concede on each point by getting corresponding
value in return. Do not give away any concession without getting something of equal
or greater value in return.
</p>
<p>Without an effective concession strategy, most negotiations will result in deadlock
or a failure to agree. However, a deadlock does not necessarily mean that the negotia-
tion failed. The parties to a negotiation could be so far apart in their positions that
an agreement is not likely. In such cases, it may actually be better not to agree than

<p>to accept a poor agreement. This is why it is very important for the negotiator to
have adequately prepared and established a thoughtful BATNA before the negotia-
tion begins. The negotiator must be aware of available options and understand that
no deal may be better than a bad deal.
</p>
<p>The manner in which a negotiator approaches concession making is an important
part of every negotiation strategy. A buyer who opens the negotiation with a low ini-
tial offer (on price, for example) followed by a relatively small concession is signaling
a reluctance to be flexible. Conversely, a cooperative opening position or moderate of-
fer followed by a relatively strong concession signals a willingness to be flexible and
to reach mutual agreement.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 13.4 illustrates how the pattern of concession making might influence the
other party&rsquo;s response. If a seller continues to offer concessions during a negotiation,
the buyer is likely to continue to ask for further concessions. Examine Exhibit 13.4,
and ask yourself if you would continue to another round of negotiation given the pat-
tern of concessions presented. How negotiators position their concessions will often
affect the length and cost of the negotiation. It also affects the other party&rsquo;s expecta-
tions of the possible outcomes.
</p>
<p>Hendon, Roy, and Ahmed offered the following 12 guidelines for making success-
ful concessions:15
</p>
<p>&bull; Give yourself enough room to make concessions.
</p>
<p>&bull; Try to get the other party to start revealing his or her needs and objectives
first.
</p>
<p>&bull; Be the first to concede on a minor issue but not the first to concede on a ma-
jor issue.

<p>&bull; Make unimportant concessions and portray them as more valuable than

</p>
<p>Suppliers or buyers who open with their best and final offers with no concessions
are practicing Boulwarism&mdash;a negotiating style named after Lemuel R. Boulware, the
former CEO of General Electric. This approach usually creates an unrealistic expecta-
tion because negotiators expect more concessions to follow. When concessions fail to
come about as expected, the other side often becomes angry or believes that its coun-
terpart is not bargaining in good faith. In fact, Boulwarism is now generally defined
as bad-faith or no-concession bargaining.16 Negotiations featuring Boulwarism are
more likely to end in deadlock or no agreement.
</p>
<p>Although concessions are an important part of the negotiation process, a willing-
ness to offer large concessions is usually not in the best interests of a buyer. The level
of planning and the relative power of each party will influence how much, how often,
and when each party concedes its positions during a negotiation.
</p>
<p>Negotiation Tactics: Trying to Reach Agreement
Negotiation tactics are the short-term plans and actions employed to execute a
</p>
<p>strategy, cause a conscious change in a counterpart&rsquo;s position, or influence others to
achieve negotiation objectives. Negotiators develop tactics to ethically persuade their
counterparts to endorse a certain position or agree to a preferred outcome. Further-
more, a negotiator must learn to recognize and understand the type of tactics a
counterpart is using. An awareness of a counterpart&rsquo;s tactics usually mitigates the
effectiveness of those tactics.
</p>
<p>Some tactics used by buyers and sellers are actually ploys or tricks to get the other
party to agree to an issue or contract without question. However, this does not dimin-
ish the fact that there are many legitimate and ethical tactics that a buyer or seller
can use to persuade the other party to endorse a particular perspective. The following
represents only a small sample of negotiation tactics that the astute and adequately
prepared negotiator should be aware of and prepare for:
</p>
<p>&bull; Low Ball. This tactic involves one party, often the seller, offering an unusu-
ally low price to receive a buyer&rsquo;s business (getting one&rsquo;s foot in the door).
Suppliers know that, once a buyer makes a commitment to a seller, it is of-
ten difficult for that buyer to switch to another supplier due to the consis-
tency principle.
</p>
<p>&bull; Honesty and Openness. Parties with a close working relationship often have
a level of mutual trust that promotes free and open sharing of information.

<p>478 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The objective of this tactic is to make each party aware of the relevant infor-
mation needed to create a mutually acceptable agreement.
</p>
<p>&bull; Questions. Open-ended questions serve a dual purpose as a negotiation tac-
tic. First, insightful questions can result in revealing new information about
the interests underlying the other party&rsquo;s stated position. Second, questions
provide a period of relief or reflection as the other party takes time to con-
sider an answer. Questions seeking only a &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo; answer do not pro-
vide much additional information.
</p>
<p>&bull; Caucus. This tactic involves taking a time-out; negotiators might need to pro-
cess new information, take a needed break, or take a recess if the negotia-
tion is going poorly; negotiators might feel they are making too many con-
cessions and need to break the pattern.
</p>
<p>&bull; Trial Balloon. A negotiator using this tactic might ask, &ldquo;What if I can per-
suade my manager to endorse this option? Would you go along?&rdquo; Trial bal-
loons are tests of acceptability. The other party&rsquo;s on-the-spot reaction to the
idea influences whether the parties should pursue the idea further.
</p>
<p>&bull; Price Increase. Sellers sometimes argue that, if a buyer does not agree to a
certain price or condition, the price will soon increase. A well-informed and
adequately prepared negotiator can tell the difference between a real price
change and a tactic used by the seller merely to make the sale.
</p>
<p>&bull; High Ball. This tactic involves taking an abnormally high initial position on
an issue. For example, the seller may put forth an extremely high selling
price. The underlying logic is that, once a party actually makes a concession
from the extreme position, the new position may appear more acceptable to
the other party. It also attempts to shift the bargaining zone in one&rsquo;s favor.
</p>
<p>&bull; Best and Final Offer. This tactic often signals the end of a negotiation on a
given issue. The caveat to this tactic is that the person making the best and fi-
nal offer must be prepared to actually end the discussion if the other party
does not accept the offer. If a party rapidly amends a best and final offer,
this tactic quickly loses its effectiveness, and the negotiator loses credibility
when the bluff is called.
</p>
<p>&bull; Silence. This tactic involves not immediately responding when the other
party makes an offer in the hope that an awkward silence will encourage fur-
ther offers or concessions. We often show the tendency to fill in the gaps
when a discussion encounters silence so as to not offend the other party.
Also, when the counterpart makes a point that weakens our position, it may
be better to remain silent than to admit the other party is correct. The other
party may actually back away from its earlier position.
</p>
<p>&bull; Planned Concessions. This tactic uses concessions to influence the other par-
ty&rsquo;s behavior. The use of planned concessions signals that it is now the other
party&rsquo;s turn to reciprocate and make a concession on an important issue.
There is a natural tendency for an individual to respond in kind when receiv-
ing a concession.
</p>
<p>&bull; Venue. Some negotiators insist on negotiating in a location that is more fa-
vorable to them. One party may have to travel a great distance, face the sun,
or sit in an uncomfortable chair in an effort to create stress. Also, the choice
of venue can affect whether or not a negotiator can get up and leave the nego-
tiation at a critical time.

<p>Chapter 13 Negotiation 479</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>According to Robert Cialdini, an expert on the psychology of negotiation and con-
flict resolution, we can cluster the hundreds of negotiation tactics that exist into six
general categories, which represent fundamental social psychology principles that
guide human behavior.17
</p>
<p>&bull; Reciprocation. Virtually every human society adheres to the principle of re-
ciprocation, which means that we feel an obligation to give something back
of equal or greater value to someone after we have received something from
them. In negotiation, this principle creates an obligation to return some-
thing in kind when the other party offers a concession. Effective negotiators
understand the influence that reciprocity has on most individuals. Negotia-
tions have a definite pattern in the concession exchange process and can
strongly influence the level of concession offered by each party. However, it
is often unnecessary to respond to a concession at the same or higher level
of value if the concession requested is important to you.
</p>
<p>&bull; Consistency. This principle says that we prefer to be consistent in our beliefs
and actions. In a negotiation, if we can get others to agree to something,
then not following through on their part would be inconsistent and irratio-
nal, a behavior to be avoided. Also, skilled negotiators also understand that,
after someone agrees to something, he or she feels better about that decision
than before he or she agreed. Furthermore, once a small commitment is in
place, it becomes easier to request larger commitments later. The consis-
tency trap is a very powerful tactic and can be difficult to back away from.
</p>
<p>&bull; Social Proof. According to this principle, we look to the behavior of others
to determine what is desirable, appropriate, and correct.18 This principle of-
ten works against us in negotiations if we look to others to determine our be-
havior. For example, a seller may state that a well-respected company uses
its product, thereby providing social proof of the value of the purchase to
the buyer.
</p>
<p>&bull; Liking. This principle states that we work well and are more agreeable with
people we like or who are like us. Effective negotiators, therefore, should
take sufficient time to get to know their counterparts, knowing that desired
concessions are more likely when a favorable level of familiarity exists.
</p>
<p>&bull; Authority. This principle states that we are more likely to accept the posi-
tions, arguments, and direction from recognized authority figures, not unlike
the impact of legitimate power described above. In a negotiation, a senior
sales executive may be able to substantially influence an inexperienced
buyer, simply because of his or her implied authority or formal position in
the organization.
</p>
<p>&bull; Scarcity. Sellers learn early in their career the powerful influence that scar-
city, or even the perception of potential scarcity, can have on a buyer. Who
wants to close a plant because supply will be short next month (unless the
buyer acts now)? The same argument applies to price increases. If the prod-
uct will be scarce at the new price, then the implication is that the buyer
needs to act before the price increase takes effect.
</p>
<p>A tactic used during one negotiation may not be successful or applicable to an-
other negotiation, even with the same counterpart. When conducting a negotiation,
effective negotiators must be willing to modify tactics that are not effective and pre-
pare for responses to tactics that are likely to be used against them. Tactics are most

<p>effective when the other party is unprepared, stressed, under severe time deadlines, in-
experienced, fatigued, or disinterested. Be prepared, and don&rsquo;t react off the cuff with-
out analyzing the tactic and its real effects.
</p>
<p>Win-Win Negotiation
Many traditional supply managers believe that the primary objective of negotiation
</p>
<p>is to win at the expense of suppliers. We call this win-lose negotiation (also called com-
petitive or distributive bargaining). Win-lose negotiation means that two or more par-
ties are competing over a fixed value with the winner taking the larger share. It is
also known as a zero-sum, or fixed-sum, game&mdash;if one party gains, it is only at the ex-
pense of the other party. Every increase in the purchase price benefits only the seller,
and every decrease in price benefits only the buyer. There are no other possible out-
comes. The level of competition in a win-lose purchase negotiation rarely makes a sup-
plier anxious to cooperate with a buyer to provide advantages that are not available
to other customers. There is no inherent advantage for the supplier to do so.
</p>
<p>Win-win negotiation (also called integrative bargaining) seeks to expand the value or
resources available to all participants through collaborative negotiation. The parties
still negotiate, but they do so to determine how to equitably divide a bigger and ex-
panded value pie through the use of creative proposals. For example, increased value
to the buyer may mean receiving a more favorable purchase price than a competitor,
a shorter order cycle time from the supplier, joint efforts to reduce duplication or
waste between the parties, or assistance in developing new technology or product de-
signs. On the supplier&rsquo;s side, increasing value may mean additional sales volume, pref-
erential treatment for future business, or technical assistance provided by the buyer
to help reduce its operating costs. Exhibit 13.5 contrasts the characteristics of win-
lose and win-win negotiation.
</p>
<p>The fundamental question of win-win negotiation is how the buyer and seller,
through a collaborative negotiation process, can pursue integrative bargaining and ex-
pand the pie available to both parties. Previous research has identified five different
methods for pursuing integrative (win-win) agreements.19
</p>
<p>&bull; Expand the Pie. Working closely together, the parties identify creative ways
to expand available resources or generate new value obtained through a nego-
tiated agreement. For example, the seller that offers a buyer early access to
new technology for inclusion in its own new products can help create new

<p>value. If the market embraces the new product, presumably sales will in-
crease, and the supplier will receive larger purchase orders. Both parties be-
come better off.
</p>
<p>&bull; Logroll. Successful logrolling requires the parties to identify more than one is-
sue where disagreement exists. The parties agree to trade off these issues so
each party has a top-priority issue satisfied. This is a form of compromise in
which each party gets more in those issues that are most important to him
or her while giving up more on those issues that are less critical yet are im-
portant to the other party.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use Nonspecific Compensation. With this approach, one party achieves his
or her objective on an issue while the other receives something of value as a
reward for going along. This approach works only when the compensating
party knows what is valuable to the other party and makes a reasonable of-
fer to make the other party whole for agreeing.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cut the Costs for Compliance. With cost cutting, one party (usually the
buyer) gets a lower price as the parties work jointly to reduce the seller&rsquo;s
costs or the transaction costs of doing business together. The buyer satisfies
his or her objective of a obtaining a competitive price while the seller be-
comes more competitive in the marketplace due to a reduced cost structure.
</p>
<p>&bull; Find a Bridge Solution. Bridging involves inventing new options that satisfy
each party&rsquo;s needs. Although bridging solutions will likely not totally satisfy
each party, they are usually satisfactory to each side. As in the third point of
Triangle Talk (propose action in such a way that they can accept it), the ne-
gotiators seek to jointly create solutions that satisfy the interests and needs
of both parties.
</p>
<p>A win-win negotiation approach works best for items or services that are impor-
tant to the buyer&rsquo;s products or business or when the item involves high-dollar items
or services where cost control is critical. It is also appropriate when the supplier adds
a high level of value to the product or service. When variables such as technology, cy-
cle time, quality, and price/cost are important, win-win negotiating may also be the
best approach.

</p>
<p>Mack Trucks, which is part of a newly consolidated operation comprising the truck-
making units of Volvo, Renault, and Mack, is facing intense pricing pressure from customers
and competitors. The ability to meet its financial targets has presented a major challenge
for the company. With limited ability to raise truck prices and declining demand, the alter-
natives facing Mack were to manage material costs better or absorb price increases through
lower profit margins and profitability.
</p>
<p>Even before Volvo assumed ownership of Mack Trucks and Renault, Mack and Renault
sought to leverage the commonality between them on a global basis. Mack Trucks had con-
cluded that procurement offered excellent opportunities for global synergy across Europe and
North America. Mack Trucks, working jointly with Renault, had implemented a global sourc-

<p>ing process designed to leverage the volumes available through the combined truck units.
Volvo Truck is now part of that process. A central part of this process features negotiation to
help the three combined companies carry out their vision of global procurement.
</p>
<p>MACK TRUCK&rsquo;S GLOBAL SOURCING PROCESS
The global sourcing process at Volvo/Renault/Mack Trucks, originally developed by Mack, con-
sists of nine steps. Part of the benefit from this process is the discipline built into each step
concerning the completion of tasks. Cross-functional sourcing teams are responsible for fol-
lowing this process as they develop and negotiate global procurement contracts. The com-
pany uses the nine-step process even for contracts that the sourcing teams determine are
regional rather than global.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 13.6 describes the Volvo/Renault/Mack Trucks&rsquo; nine-step global sourcing process.
Steps 0&ndash;4 of the process involve strategy development, whereas Steps 5&ndash;8 involve strategy
implementation.
</p>
<p>STEP 0: SELECT GLOBAL SOURCING PROJECTS
An executive steering committee is responsible for selecting sourcing projects and identifying
the cost savings expected from each project. The steering committee plays a vital role in main-
taining the intensity of the global sourcing process. Step 0 is continuous because the agree-
ments established early in the global process eventually come up for periodic review and/or
renewal.
</p>
<p>STEP 1: LAUNCH THE PROJECT
Perhaps the most important task associated with Step 1 is the formation of sourcing teams.
The executive team selects team members based on their familiarity with the items under re-
view. A formal team leader works with the team to develop time schedules, a list of deliver-
ables, and expected milestones.
</p>
<p>In Step 1, the teams validate the sourcing opportunity by collecting and analyzing data. Vari-
ous tools are available to support each team&rsquo;s analysis. For example, the teams use a portfo-
lio analysis approach with suggested tactics and strategies depending on the characteristics
of the purchase requirement. This tool helps the team develop a sourcing strategy that best
matches the actual purchasing need.
</p>
<p>STEP 2: DEVELOP THE SOURCING PROJECT
Some managers believe this step to be the most critical, as the sourcing teams identify poten-
tial worldwide suppliers. From a list of potential suppliers, the teams sends a request for infor-
mation, which is a generic questionnaire that asks about sales, production capacity, quality
certification (such as ISO 9000), familiarity with the truck business, and major customers.

<p>Step 2 requires a major work effort on the part of engineering. Engineers will examine drawings
in an effort to standardize part specifications among Volvo, Renault, and Mack Trucks. Although
a team may conclude that there is no global supplier, they may be able to standardize design
specifications across the companies.
</p>
<p>STEP 3: DEVELOP REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS
Step 3 features the development, sending, and analysis of formal proposals to suppliers identi-
fied in Step 2. Suppliers typically require six weeks to analyze and return the RFPs. The sourc-
ing teams are responsible for analyzing the details of the returned RFPs. The teams are
empowered to determine the criteria and the evaluation weights used to analyze each supplier,
but members must reach consensus in their choices about which suppliers to recommend.
</p>
<p>A negotiation workshop occurs during this step at the Renault Learning Center in France. The
purpose of this workshop is to review the tools that are necessary to support the global pro-
cess and to improve negotiation skills. The first half of the meeting is committed to overall
training. The second half helps individual teams develop their negotiation strategy. The
teams will also select a negotiation leader. The decision of who should be the negotiation
leader is based on discussion and consensus rather than voting. Of the first 27 global proj-
ects, fully one third of the negotiation leaders were selected from outside the sourcing team.
</p>
<p>STEP 4: RECOMMEND STRATEGY AND NEGOTIATE WITH SUPPLIERS
Each sourcing team makes a strategy recommendation to an executive committee comprising
the vice president of purchasing and the vice president of engineering from each of the three
companies. Team recommendations include the selected supplier(s) to use with expected sav-
ings and timings identified.
</p>
<p>All negotiation that occurs in Step 4 is face-to-face with suppliers. To date, half of the nego-
tiations have occurred in the United States and half in Europe at company-owned sites.
When suppliers arrive for a negotiation, they review the global sourcing process so they are
aware that this step will only produce a recommendation.
</p>
<p>Before suppliers arrive for negotiations, they receive feedback concerning their competitive-
ness, which allows them to revise their proposal before negotiations commence. A team may
disqualify a supplier if the supplier is not competitive and chooses not to revise its proposal.
The negotiation also serves as an opportunity to verify that new suppliers can meet technical
or commercial requirements.
</p>
<p>Once the lead negotiator takes over, the team leader&rsquo;s role begins to diminish (unless the
team leader is the lead negotiator). The team leader usually remains part of the negotiating
team. Negotiation sessions generally last three hours. Although the team&rsquo;s objective is to
achieve cost savings, the negotiations can discuss many kinds of issues.
</p>
<p>STEP 5: CERTIFY SUPPLIERS
During Step 5, the purchasing and engineering groups receive the global sourcing team&rsquo;s rec-
ommendation and results from the negotiation. Functional directors will begin budgeting ex-
pected savings in their financial plans. The output from Step 5 is a certification from
affected functional groups of the recommended supplier. Step 5 represents a hand-off of a
proposed and negotiated sourcing strategy from the global sourcing team to the purchasing,
engineering, and quality groups.

<p>484 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Good Practice Example illustrates how a company uses negotiation to add
value to its sourcing process. Without highly skilled and well-trained negotiators, the
development of global sourcing strategies, such as the one illustrated here, would not
be possible. The magnitude and complexity of global agreements, which are usually
longer term in length and address many non-price issues, demand face-to-face
negotiation.
</p>
<p>International Negotiation
With the burgeoning growth in international business, especially in outsourcing
</p>
<p>and global sourcing activities over the last 20 years, the need to effectively and effi-
ciently negotiate across cultures has increased exponentially. Thomas Friedman gave
us an example of a truly global supply chain in his recent book, The World Is Flat, in
which he describes how Dell sources components for and builds its notebook compu-
ters.20 In a truly global supply chain, Dell utilizes multiple suppliers located in a vari-
ety of countries for different parts and components. If a given Dell supplier is unable
to meet current demand, then Dell can shift its sourcing to another supplier with
available capacity regardless of location. For example, Dell can shift its sourcing of In-
tel microprocessors from factories located in the Philippines, Costa Rica, Malaysia, or
China. Therefore, different negotiation strategies are needed to negotiate purchase
agreements in such diverse cultures as Costa Rica and Malaysia.
</p>
<p>Negotiations with suppliers located literally anywhere on the globe take on added
complexity and challenge when the parties have different languages, customs, laws, and
cultures. When preparing for a negotiation with a supplier located in another country,
companies must invest in substantial extra time and effort in planning for the negotia-
tion to accommodate new translation, travel, and other foreign business requirements.
One of the more important considerations in negotiating a global sourcing agreement
</p>
<p>STEP 6: FORMALIZE THE SOURCING CONTRACT
This step involves formalizing what transpired during contract negotiations. The negotiation
leader remains with the process until the contract is complete. The legal department is also
involved, but a buyer writes the contract using a predetermined template.
</p>
<p>Global contracts, which are typically two to three years in duration, differ from traditional con-
tracts. The global agreements include productivity improvement requirements to offset material
cost increases and encourage technical advancements by the supplier. And, in a somewhat sig-
nificant departure from previous contracting practices, incentives such as 50/50 improvement
sharing are starting to appear.
</p>
<p>STEP 7: SAMPLE TESTING AND APPROVAL
This step assesses the samples provided by the selected supplier. The production facilities de-
velop initial sample inspection reports, and the negotiation leader develops a production roll-
out plan.
</p>
<p>STEP 8: PRODUCTION READINESS
Step 8 is the pilot production stage. The selected supplier may send a day&rsquo;s worth or a
week&rsquo;s worth of supply for use and testing in actual production.

<p>is culture shock.21 Culture shock occurs as a result of negotiators being immersed in a
place in which their established norms have been confronted and may no longer be ap-
plicable. The negotiator&rsquo;s pre-existing values, beliefs, rules, and schema may not apply
in the new situation. Emotions run higher, and they may initially encounter substantial
anxiety, disorientation, and confusion, thereby reducing the likelihood of achieving
their desired negotiation outcomes.
</p>
<p>Various barriers may dramatically affect the conduct of international negotia-
tions.22 In order of importance, major obstacles to effective international negotiation
include miscommunication due to language, time limitations, cultural differences,
and limited authority of the international negotiator. Effective international negotia-
tors also demonstrate certain personal characteristics that can help overcome these
obstacles. These characteristics include patience, knowledge of the contract agree-
ment, an honest and polite attitude, and familiarity with foreign cultures and cus-
toms. See Sourcing Snapshot: FedEx Expert Shares His International Negotiating
Insights for a look at how one company effectively considers the nuances and differ-
ences between cultures to more effectively negotiate.
</p>
<p>Beyond the natural barriers of language differences, it is still possible to fail to un-
derstand and be understood. What we consider as generally accepted words may
have substantially different meanings in other countries, even between countries that
speak the same language, because culture plays such a significant role in communica-
tion. For example, during international negotiation, an interpreter might verbally com-
municate yet not fully convey the significance of unspoken actions, signals, and
customs that are invisible to the foreign or non-native negotiator.

<p>Mike Babineaux, senior business specialist at FedEx&rsquo;s Strategic Sourcing and Supply
Center of Excellence, offers good advice for any American who negotiates internationally. &ldquo;Ev-
ery person who negotiates with other cultures must be aware of the serious and costly mis-
takes and misunderstandings in business practices that are caused by cultural differences,&rdquo;
warns Babineaux. Although nations, on the surface, are changing every day in many ways,
the fundamentals of culture evolve at a much slower pace.
</p>
<p>In the area of communication, Babineaux says, &ldquo;Americans tend to speak directly and
openly. We want the truth, and we want it now. We are suspicious when we think someone
is being evasive.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the American who proceeds in the direct American style in
a negotiation will not be particularly effective in some countries. &ldquo;He or she will be on a differ-
ent wavelength than the foreigner because our style of communication is very different from
others,&rdquo; he explains. An open person may be seen as weak, directness may come across as
abrupt, and written contracts may imply that a person&rsquo;s word is not good. In the end, Babi-
neaux explains, &ldquo;Negotiators who have the greatest success in doing business around the
world are those who have learned to have credible appreciation and understanding of those
with whom they do business.&rdquo;

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>International negotiation requires additional planning and preparation to be suc-
cessful. Not only must buyers perform their normal supplier analysis and fact find-
ing, they must also strive to more fully understand the customs and traditions of
their counterpart. As buying and selling increases between organizations located in
different countries, the need for higher-level global negotiation skills will also
increase.
</p>
<p>Selected Countries
The following presents a sample of national characteristics when negotiating, ad-
</p>
<p>mittedly from an American perspective. However, understanding these profiles can
prove beneficial when developing negotiation strategies and tactics.23 A negotiator
must be aware, however, that there is a danger in stereotyping or oversimplifying char-
acteristics of different cultures. There is always substantial interpersonal variation to
consider within a single culture. However, there are certain tendencies within the cul-
ture of which to be aware.
</p>
<p>The following discussion outlines very general observations and guidelines for sev-
eral popular business cultures (shown in alphabetical order) in which a supply man-
ager is likely to negotiate.
</p>
<p>Brazil
Although Brazilians are receptive to discussing most subjects, home and family
</p>
<p>are private, personal matters and are not appropriate topics for casual acquaintances.
Avoid conversations involving religion or politics. You may speak English or use an
interpreter unless you are conversant in Portuguese. They are generally more analyti-
cal than other Latin American cultures and will look at the particulars of each situa-
tion rather than referring to rules or laws for guidance. They like to bargain and
concede little by little. During negotiations, Brazilians tend to approach problems indi-
rectly, allowing their feelings, passion, and enthusiasm to influence their decisions. Al-
though the presentation of facts during a negotiation is acceptable, these facts usually
will not overrule underlying subjective feelings. The image of the macho male is still
prevalent, although to a lesser extent than in Mexico, for example, and Brazilian men
expect women to be subordinate. There are also large numbers of German and Japa-
nese descendents in Brazil, which may complicate the negotiation somewhat.
</p>
<p>China
When negotiating with the Chinese, it is important to avoid slang or jargon and
</p>
<p>to use short, simple sentences with pauses to ensure your words are understood ex-
actly. Never do anything that might embarrass your Chinese counterpart. A negotia-
tor should expect to make presentations to many groups at various organizational
levels. Because U.S. managers have a reputation for impatience, the Chinese will ex-
tend negotiations beyond the deadline to gain an advantage. Do not exaggerate your
ability to deliver on your promises. Your counterparts will hold you to your commit-
ments. They may even try to renegotiate previously agreed-upon issues on the last
day, and they will continue to try for a better deal even after signing the agreement.
However, you must be patient in your dealings with Chinese negotiators, who also
prefer to deal with groups, not individuals. Use an interpreter, even if your Chinese
counterpart speaks excellent English. S

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>France
Given their highly formal and reserved nature, a casual attitude during business
</p>
<p>may alienate the French. Allow for sufficient time to conduct the negotiation, as deci-
sions are made slowly and deliberately. During negotiations, arguments are made
from a critical perspective with elegant wit and logic. The French enjoy engaging in
debate, striving for effect rather than detail and facts. You should consider using a lo-
cal agent to assist with the process. Although the French will accept information for
the purpose of debate and may even change their minds, a desire to maintain a
strong cultural heritage often prohibits them from accepting anything that is contrary
to their cultural norm. Because the French are strongly individualistic with a central-
ized authority structure, negotiating with the proper individual can lead to quick deci-
sions. Dress conservatively in well-made clothing.
</p>
<p>Germany
Germans are not openly receptive to outside information. Their strict hierarchies
</p>
<p>and separation of units often prohibit the sharing of information even across the
same organization. These hierarchies can also slow the making of business decisions.
Germans rarely engage in humor during business activities. During a negotiation, ob-
jective facts form the basis of truth rather than subjective feelings, and Germans are
highly analytical. Nowhere is punctuality more important than in Germany. Arriving
just two or three minutes late to a negotiation can be insulting. During negotiations,
Germans tend to be unemotional because of a high need for social and personal or-
der. German contracts are often more detailed and specific than in the United States,
and documentation and clarity are both very important.
</p>
<p>India
English is widely spoken in India among businesspeople and government officials;
</p>
<p>therefore, it is less necessary to obtain an interpreter or translate one&rsquo;s business
cards. Be sensitive of the need to avoid personal questions and talking about religion,
poverty, or politics. It is important to speak with the highest-ranking person possible,
as decisions are made at the highest levels of the organization. Organizations in India
tend to be very hierarchical and autocratic. In addition, Indian bureaucracy is very
burdensome, while the pace of business tends to be leisurely. As a result, delays in
the negotiation are to be expected. Vegetarian diets are typical, and business negotia-
tions often occur in prominent hotels, not in restaurants. Titles are highly valued, so
always address your counterparts by their official titles.
</p>
<p>Japan
Japanese culture is vastly different from American culture. Despite such differ-
</p>
<p>ences, the extra effort needed to develop mutually satisfying negotiations can result
in an excellent relationship&mdash;Japanese firms are dependable and loyal suppliers. They
will treat their customers like valuable family members. The negotiation process with
Japanese companies is unique. For example, the Japanese are comfortable with ex-
tended silence, which is not true with Americans. As members of a collectivist soci-
ety, they are loyal team players concerned with the well-being of their country and
firm rather than themselves as individuals. Politeness is valued above all else. Instead
of saying &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Japanese often say &ldquo;Hai,&rdquo; which does not indicate agreement
but merely that they hear or understand. The Japanese don&rsquo;t like surprises, and
they typically reach decisions through a consensus process, which can often extend

<p>negotiations. When negotiating, keep in mind that it is necessary to convince the
whole group rather than a single individual. Also, avoid placing the Japanese in a posi-
tion in which they must admit failure or lose face. The Japanese do not like the ap-
pearance of having to make forced concessions. There is a strong emphasis on
interpersonal relationships and less on formal contracts. Therefore, connections with
intermediaries are important. Choose them wisely.
</p>
<p>Mexico
As in Brazil, subjectivity is often the basis for decision making. Mexican negotia-
</p>
<p>tors enjoy the process of bargaining and exchange. The pace of business activity will
be much slower than what Americans are used to. It is important to develop and
maintain close personal friendships with the right people. Individual dignity is impor-
tant, so be polite and avoid anything that might embarrass your Mexican counter-
part. The foreign negotiator should emphasize the benefits of a proposal to the
individual, his or her family, and pride. Financing is often an issue, so you need to
be creative in offering financial solutions. It is customary for the oldest person to
pick up the tab for a group meal, although it is typical to haggle over the check. It is
important to recognize a person&rsquo;s title and position.
</p>
<p>Russia
Russian negotiators are very patient, as compromise is considered a sign of weak-
</p>
<p>ness. However, they tend to make very extreme initial demands and wait for the for-
eign negotiator to concede. Final offers are seldom final during the initial stages of
negotiation. Long-term interpersonal relationships are less important than in many
other cultures. They expect you to walk away from the table and threaten that you
cannot reach agreement with them. However, Russian negotiators often have limited
authority to make decisions at the table and will refer to absentee third-party deci-
sion makers. You need to be aware that some negotiations are designed only to gener-
ate information, not make a deal. End-of-negotiation demands are typical, even
though you may assume that the deal is complete. Because of the inconvertibility of
the ruble, financing may be difficult and require creative solutions such as counter-
trade or third-party financing.
</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia
Saudi negotiators are considered astute and perceptive. They may stand very close
</p>
<p>to you and place a hand on your shoulder. Concession making is ritualistic and
stems from extreme opening proposals. Decisions take time to materialize from exten-
sive deliberation. Deadlines are made to be ignored. As in many other cultures, devel-
oping and maintaining a strong interpersonal relationship with your counterpart is
important. Social life usually takes place during the day, as there is no nightlife as we
might expect at home. Saudi negotiators rely heavily on their religious beliefs to
make decisions. Also, plan your trip so as not to conflict with religious holidays.
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; generally means &ldquo;maybe.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Vietnam
You will need to be patient and wait until your Vietnamese counterpart initiates
</p>
<p>the business discussion. Answers to many questions will be broad and not very spe-
cific. A nodding head does not mean &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; merely that you are being heard or even
that they disagree with you. Patience is very important and is often used to wear

<p>down the foreign negotiator into making unreciprocated concessions. Use of a skilled
interpreter is vital as there are various nuances to the words chosen and gestures
made. Speak to the other party, not to the interpreter. Vietnamese typically negotiate
in a group setting, not individually.
</p>
<p>The Impact of the Internet on Negotiations
Use of information technology, particularly the Internet, e-mail, and instant mes-
</p>
<p>saging, can dramatically change the nature of a negotiation. Electronic means of nego-
tiation tend to equalize the interactions between the parties because normal visual
cues and sources of power are not as evident.24 Status differences are not as visible,
and social norms and behaviors are more difficult to discern. Voice inflections, which
often provide substantial meaning to the words used to communicate, do not exist
electronically. The use of such devices as emoticons attempts to provide context but
is not as effective as nonverbal communication, which is missing from electronic nego-
tiations. In addition, the negotiator at the other end of the electronic connection is
relatively anonymous. Is the person you think you are negotiating with actually do-
ing the negotiating?
</p>
<p>Research indicates that negotiators communicating by electronic means often a differ-
ent persona than they do face-to-face. They engage in more risky behaviors and are
more aggressive in their demands than their face-to-face counterparts. E-negotiators
make more aggressive demands, threats, and take-it-or-leave-it ultimatums. Informa-
tion richness, usually obtained from nonverbal clues, context, and informal communica-
tion, is lost electronically. In addition, active listening and effective feedback are more
difficult to conduct when not negotiating face-to-face.
</p>
<p>E-negotiators tend to engage in behaviors that indicate that they are communicat-
ing in real time even when they are not. The normal give-and-take in a face-to-face
negotiation is not present, and the e-negotiators ask fewer questions and tend to
make more assumptions during the negotiation. For example, what does silence
mean when the negotiators are communicating electronically? Also, e-negotiators of-
ten feel less accountable for the outcomes because of a perceived disconnect with
their counterparts in a different locale. They also tend to take on a more adversarial,
&ldquo;us-versus-them,&rdquo; mentality. The bottom line is that negotiators who interact face-to-
face are more likely to reach agreement and avoid impasse than their electronic
counterparts.
</p>
<p>Considering all of the challenges in negotiating electronically, it remains a business re-
ality that some negotiations, particularly global negotiations, must be accomplished at a
distance because of timing constraints and substantial travel costs. One way to mitigate
the negative effects of a distance-challenged negotiation is to conduct an initial face-to-
face meeting prior to e-negotiations. This face-to-face meeting helps to foster greater
trust and reduce uncertainty in future interactions that are conducted electronically.
Many long-term sourcing agreements can be facilitated effectively in this manner, that
is, an initial physical meeting followed by electronic-facilitated communication. If a face-
to-face meeting is impractical, some of the same positive effects can be accomplished
initially through the use of a telephone call or videoconference between the parties, allow-
ing for an informal period of sharing and getting to know your counterpart as a person.S

Example
</p>
<p>Texas Instruments
Provides Its Procurement
Professionals with Com-
prehensive Global Negotia-
tion Skills and Enhanced
Cultural Understanding25
</p>
<p>Many U.S.-based companies have successfully demonstrated their negotiation and rela-
tionship skills in dealing with domestic suppliers. However, those same levels of negotiation
skills and relationship management experience often prove inadequate when dealing with an
increasingly global supply base. There are substantial caveats and challenges involved in ne-
gotiating with foreign suppliers, particularly in the initial stages of negotiating a sourcing
contract. In 2003, Texas Instruments (TI) developed and implemented a comprehensive profes-
sional development program to more effectively prepare its procurement professionals and
others within the company to comprehend, value, and appropriately act in response to those
cultural differences they will face in foreign cultures where they conduct business.
</p>
<p>TI introduced this cultural awareness program in response to a corporate strategy that fo-
cused on finding and utilizing suppliers in low-cost countries and regions, such as Eastern
Europe and Asia. The program allows TI&rsquo;s procurement professionals to develop higher-level
negotiation and relationship skills with suppliers located in these cultures. These professional
development programs are delivered by internal personnel and can be tailored to TI employ-
ees operating throughout the world. Training can be specifically adapted to cultural differ-
ences encountered and for different industries, companies, and products.
</p>
<p>Program deliverables include the ability to challenge personal expectations and assumptions
from both the buyer and supplier perspectives, describe the buyer&rsquo;s expectations in clear and
understandable terms, scrutinize and cultivate understanding of the supplier&rsquo;s assumptions,
and bridge the differences encountered in the exchange process. The overall program objec-
tive is to prevent, preclude, or mitigate the difficulties and disruptions that would typically
be encountered when negotiating with people from other cultures.
</p>
<p>One of the prime benefits from this has been the ability of negotiators to understand why pre-
vious negotiations may not have gone as well as expected. Building on this expanded knowl-
edge and cultural awareness, the outcomes from more recent negotiations have been more
in line with company expectations. Those who have completed this training have been able
to effectively break down negotiation and relationship barriers. It has proven important to un-
derstand the supplier&rsquo;s perspectives and values and take them into active consideration
when planning and conducting a sourcing negotiation. The TI courses have also conditioned
participants to be better prepared to deal with the extended time frames typically involved in
negotiating with global suppliers due to the need for protracted relationship building. One ad-
ditional benefit that doesn&rsquo;t relate to global negotiations is that the same skills have been ap-
plied to improving the performance of TI&rsquo;s global work teams.

<p>CONCLUSION
An organization&rsquo;s commercial success is partly due to the skill of its negotiators,
</p>
<p>from both its buying and selling activities. Regardless of the industry, skilled negotia-
tors share some common traits. They realize that they are not born with the requisite
negotiation knowledge and skills. Therefore, they must study, practice, and train to be-
come more effective negotiators. Research shows that skilled negotiators also have
higher aspirations and pursue more aggressive goals than their less-effective counter-
parts, which they generally achieve. Finally, individuals who are skilled at negotiation
are destined to be among an organization&rsquo;s most valued professionals.
</p>
<p>Professional supply managers must become more effective negotiators by partici-
pating in training, simulations, and workshops that develop these critical negotiation
skills. The difference between a good sourcing agreement and an excellent one is of-
ten more a function of the level of preparation and interpersonal and relationship-
building skills of the negotiator or negotiating team.

<p>The Journey to Contracting Transformation
at Roche Diagnostics
</p>
<p>Back in 2003, David Barnes and his small team of contracts professionals at Roche Di-
agnostics knew that their process was under pressure. Contract management was a tactical,
largely administrative activity, struggling to keep pace with their growth and the increasing
complexity of industry pricing schemes. Resources were deployed to fill gaps as they arose, re-
sulting in a fragmented organization, spread between different business groups and with sig-
nificant role variations. Short-term technical &ldquo;fixes&rdquo; were no longer sufficient.
</p>
<p>As vice president for finance, Barnes could see that the current organization was full of ineffi-
ciencies. The transactional nature of the contracts work limited sharing of information, result-
ing in very little replication and no consolidation of data to understand trends, issues, or
opportunities to improve. His instincts for quality told him that this was an area that could
yield significant benefits, so his team set to work.
</p>
<p>Initially, they focused on software. Clearly, this problem was not unique, so there must be an
application to address it. Solutions were identified, but they certainly were not cheap. And dur-
ing the voyage of discovery, the team came to realize that they lacked experts and had no
real sense of contracting &ldquo;best practices.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>BUILDING CONSENSUS
Analysis soon revealed a range of negative consequences that arose from a manually inten-
sive, decentralized organization with no overall contracts strategy. These included a heavy ad-
ministrative burden on Sales as well as on their customers&rsquo; procurement groups, and time-
consuming financial and billing reconciliations. It was also clear that contracting policies
and practices were being applied inconsistently.
</p>
<p>The team recognized that change would not be easy; an effective contracting strategy and
consistent process would require the support and agreement of many internal stakeholders:
Marketing, Legal, Pricing, Regulatory, Sales, Credit, and HR were among them. &ldquo;Executive sup-
port was critical to our success,&rdquo; Barnes comments. &ldquo;We knew that we had a mountain to
climb, so we established an Executive Steering Committee.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Strategy, process, people, and technology&mdash;these were the four areas that the project had to
address. Having gained agreement on the need for a center of excellence (CoE), the team de-
fined its mission: &ldquo;Roche Diagnostics&rsquo; Contracting CoE will deliver industry-leading contract
life cycle management that creates a competitive advantage and ensures quality, driving sus-
tainable market share, sales, and profitability.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>It was in 2004 that Roche became aware of IACCM and invited a visit to review their work
and discuss best practices. Later that year, IACCM issued its best practices benchmark
study, detailing the top 10 areas requiring focus. &ldquo;At last this gave us something tangible
against which we could assess our plans and monitor our progress,&rdquo; Barnes explains. &ldquo;We
found we had recognized many of the items on their list, but were tackling only some of
them. That was OK&mdash;we knew we must prioritize.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>MONITORING PROGRESS
In the early phases, the Sales groups were reluctant to agree on any centralization or rationali-
zation, for fear that this would damage flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs. It
was important to demonstrate that centralization did not equate to increased bureaucracy or
a rigid, rules-based mentality. The question of ownership was inevitably sensitive and highly
political. So rather than dictate an answer, the question was posed to the cross-functional
project team: Where should this report? They produced a helpful matrix of pros and cons.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&ldquo;In the end,&rdquo; Barnes says, &ldquo;the team agreed on Finance because of our process focus and
our ability to understand risk and opportunity tradeoffs.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Today, the re-engineering has resulted in substantial progress on five of the IACCM top ten.
These include close alignment with product life cycle management; development of an elec-
tronic contracting strategy; proactive change management; and strategically aligned measure-
ments and reporting.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having external benchmarks definitely assisted our progress,&rdquo; Barnes says. &ldquo;It motivated
the team and confirmed we were on the right track. It also gave management a sense of confi-
dence that we were doing the right things, that investment made sense.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>But in the end, the project depended on visible results to obtain continued support and fund-
ing. &ldquo;Good results continue to get funded,&rdquo; Barnes says, &ldquo;but you need evidence.&rdquo; To ensure
that quality and continuous improvement were built into the process, the team established a
Contracting Strategy Board and obtained a seat for Contracts at key meetings; they built ro-
bust monitoring processes, including strong feedback loops from the field, the market, and
customers. &ldquo;Proactive people are key,&rdquo; Barnes comments. &ldquo;You must hire people who want to
make a difference&mdash;and are not afraid to be held accountable.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>THE JOURNEY CONTINUES
Nearly three years on, we asked Barnes to define the tangible results and benefits from the
journey. He highlighted seven.
</p>
<p>1. Earlier realization of business benefits
2. Improved or advanced cash flow
3. More efficient operations
</p>

<p>Introduction
In global commerce, people make risky deals&mdash;and make promises they can&rsquo;t
</p>
<p>keep. They sign a contract without reading it, and one they do not understand. They
make risky assumptions, without noticing it, and make or accept unreasonable de-
mands with or without knowing it. They assume that the terms of one market are ac-
ceptable in another, and do not recognize cultural or legal landmines. All of these are
major pitfalls in the current global economic environment.
</p>
<p>The area of managing contracts in a global environment continues to be a major
source of problems, misunderstanding, and poor execution for companies we inter-
viewed. Moreover, companies often fail to be able to bring the required resources to
bear in contractual discussions that fall outside of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; contractual guidelines
that are traditionally accepted in Western settings. As noted earlier, this is particu-
larly true in Asia Pacific and Latin America, where there are significant differences in
the perception of how to view and manage contractual relationships, and the impor-
tance of legislative action versus ongoing commitment and relationship management
as an element that supersedes contractual terminology. Many executives in interna-
tional settings recognize that seeking legislative retribution for contract noncompli-
ance is often a nonproductive outlet, especially given the uncertain and risk-laden
environment for many judicial disputes. As such, many companies seek to resolve is-
sues through a process known as &ldquo;preventive contracting,&rdquo; which involves spending
more time in the initial contracting stages to fully understand stakeholder require-
ments, expectations, and repeated communication of expectations, in order to gain a
full understanding of elements. Another important element was the need for flexibil-
ity in contractual terms and clauses, in order to facilitate mutual benefit for the suste-
nance of the relationship, given highly volatile market input factors and uncertain
factor demands.
</p>
<p>These issues were reflected in a recent study1 in which a number of interviews
with key individuals discussed some of the challenges they had experienced in global
contracting environments:
</p>
<p>Our global corporate culture demands ultimate flexibility from the sup-
plier. We will give you no demand forecast, and we expect you to do it.
We can also terminate at will and will retain all of the IP rights&mdash;so all
the flexibility is on our side. Strangely enough, suppliers see this as unrea-
sonable. So when they see that, they will of course assign costs to this re-
quirement. We are blind, as we force them to give us all the flexibility, as
if there is NO COST to doing so! We need to have some flexibility in estab-
lishing price redetermination clauses, and have the ability to tie it into
quantity discounts. However, we are unable to stick to any forecast or
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make no mistake,&rdquo; he comments. &ldquo;We still have a way to go in achieving our contracting
CoE vision&mdash;there are many benefits yet to be realized! To get there we will continue to lever-
age the resources of IACCM including their training programs, their interest groups, their
best practices, and their good counsel.&rdquo;

<p>production curve, which presents a huge risk in the marketplace. We can-
not give suppliers a forecast that they can depend on.
</p>
<p>What we need to do is to be able to break the contract into three key
chunks: (a) standard T&rsquo;s and C&rsquo;s with basic housekeeping elements, which
we know we can get right, (b) commercial terms for this specific deal
around quality and price determination, and (c) actual pricing structures
which reflect the changes in the marketplace. This is the biggest challenge
for us on a global contractual basis.
</p>
<p>In considering the challenges around contracts, Louis Brown, the father of preventive
law, who wrote the now-famous Manual of Preventive Law,2 noted the following:
</p>
<p>It usually costs less to avoid getting into trouble than to pay for getting out
of trouble.
</p>
<p>What this means is that contracts are a critical juncture for determining the success
or failure of a commercial relationship. It is better to spend the time up front to dis-
cuss expectations, define specific language and terminology, and ensure 100% commu-
nication of potential contingencies than fight a lawsuit later on when things go
wrong! Despite the obvious simplicity of this statement, firms continue to fight law-
suits at an escalating rate, and firms continue to expend extraordinary funds on legal
dispute resolution and lawsuits. One executive noted the following:
</p>
<p>We have a legal counsel to avoid litigation. We will do everything possible
to stay out of the court systems&mdash;because it always costs money to do so.
We do not want to be involved in appearances of the big bad Fortune 100
company versus the little supplier. Ethically we seek to do the right thing.
We will settle and go to extremes to stay out of the press. Disagreements
around labor contracts with consultants and manpower people are one of
our biggest headaches. Suppliers who are supplying IT labor to us seem to
cause a big problem. We buy $12 billion of labor annually and a lot of this
is with smaller companies. We have been proactive in leveraging of labor
spend. We appear to use global suppliers, but in reality they will outsource
and tier down to a second- or third-tier supplier. Unfortunately, if we push
down to a supplier in their first year, $5 million worth of business, and
they have no credit line, many are not able to handle the business, and de-
fault with their second-tier suppliers. We want to deal only with first tier
from a leveraged standpoint, but the complaints still bubble up. And we
end up having to resolve the conflicts and try to keep it out of court and
out of the press.
</p>
<p>Because supply professionals buy products and services as a career, it is not surpris-
ing that they deal regularly with contracts and complicated Tier 1 and Tier 2 supplier
contracts. It is therefore critical for supply managers to understand the underlying le-
gal aspects of business transactions and develop the skills to manage those contracts
and agreements on a day-to-day basis. Once a contract has been negotiated and
signed, the real work begins. From the moment of signing, it is the supply manager&rsquo;s
responsibility to ensure that all of the terms and conditions of the agreement are ful-
filled. If the terms and conditions of a contract are breached, purchasing is also respon-
sible for resolving the conflict. In a perfect world, there would be no need for a
contract, and all deals would be sealed with a handshake. However, contracts are an
important part of managing buyer-supplier relationships, as they explicitly define the

<p>roles and responsibilities of both parties, as well as how conflicts will be resolved if
they occur (which they almost always do!).
</p>
<p>The importance of understanding contracts is even greater in the Internet age. Pres-
ident Clinton signed the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act
in early 2000, which recognizes electronic signatures as equivalent to hard copies, but
there are important exceptions for noncommercial contracts such as divorce settle-
ments, wills, and many other types of contracts where electronic signatures do not
have legal parity with written signatures. This law facilitates the full integration of
business transactions via the Internet and was a major stepping-stone to future devel-
opments in electronic commerce. However, the importance of understanding con-
tracts and &ldquo;reading the fine print&rdquo; should not be overshadowed by this event. In fact,
it makes the role of contracts even more important in e-business.
</p>
<p>This chapter addresses contracting from several perspectives. The first sections ad-
dress the core elements of a contract and how purchasing managers go about writing
a contract. Then, the different types of contracts available to purchasing managers
are described. The next section deals with an important type of contract being used
more in purchasing scenarios: long-term contracts and alliance agreements. In the
following section, we discuss a number of unique contracts, involving information sys-
tems deployment, minority business contracts, consulting, and construction. In the
final section, we conclude with an important element: how to settle contractual dis-
putes in a buyer-supplier relationship when they arise.
</p>
<p>Elements of a Contract
Although there are significant differences in the specific wording and details of con-
</p>
<p>tracts employed by supply managers for sourcing products, processes, and services,
the structures of contracts used in purchasing products and services are fairly stan-
dard and have a number of common attributes. In general, these attributes are estab-
lished by a firm&rsquo;s legal counsel and then are modified for different types of suppliers,
products, and services. The important point to remember is that contracts establish
the terms and conditions by which two parties agree to conduct business. They de-
fine the type of relationship and pave the way for ensuring that both parties come
away with mutual benefits. As such, it is always better to spend more time in negotia-
tions to ensure that the right terminology, measures, and requirements are spelled
out in detail and agreed to. If both parties are clear about their understanding of how
they will work together, the likelihood that there will be problems and misunderstand-
ings is reduced significantly. It is much more difficult to go back and negotiate what
contractual terms actually mean once the contract has been signed and a period of
time has passed! In this regard, contracts are sometimes compared to human relation-
ships and nuptial vows; you&rsquo;d better define your understanding of what the expecta-
tions will be early on, rather than try to define expectations after the marriage has
taken place!
</p>
<p>A contract typically begins with an introduction of the parties who will be en-
gaged in the contract. For example, it might begin with the following:
</p>
<p>THIS AGREEMENT IS MADE this day of 2008
</p>
<p>BETWEEN

registered office at 44 Downing Street, London (the &ldquo;Buyer&rdquo;) and

nois and having its principal place of business at 123 Ridge Road, Chicago, Illi-
nois 60014, U.S.A. (the &ldquo;Supplier&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Following the introduction, there are several numbered sections (called &ldquo;clauses&rdquo;)
that describe the different sets of conditions that the parties agree to follow in their
conduct of their business relationship. These clauses in the first part of the contract
may also refer to a series of &ldquo;schedules&rdquo; that provide specific details behind the
clauses. These schedules may provide additional information on the method of manu-
facture, the statement of work, how to calculate specific measures, heath and safety
requirements, pricing schedules, and other important details. The schedules (which
are typically contained in the appendices at the end of the contract) are where the
real &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of the negotiations has often taken place. The following example of a spe-
cific contract between two companies (a large Fortune 500 company and a mid-sized
service supplier) is used to illustrate typical contract structures with clauses and sched-
ules. Bear in mind that there will be major variations in the details of a contract, but
the contract structure that follows is fairly representative of what most supply manage-
ment students will use in contract negotiations.
</p>
<p>1. Definitions. This section defines all of the important terms contained within
the contract and is important so everyone understands exactly what each term
means. It is better to get this clear up front, to avoid confusion later on. Some
of the typical terms might include the product or service definition and terms
such as raw materials, purchase orders (POs), on-time delivery, and price. Al-
though these might seem obvious to some people, if it is in writing, it is clear!
</p>
<p>2. Scope of Agreement. This section defines what is in and out of scope. This
might include the geographical limitations, the validity or invalidity of prior
contracts, preferential treatment by the supplier, or other elements.
</p>
<p>3. Purchase Orders. This section outlines the relationship between the Agreement
and any other purchase orders issued by the company to the supplier. For exam-
ple, it might state that &ldquo;any Purchase Order for Products submitted by a Buyer
affiliate during the term of this Agreement shall be deemed to be on the terms
and conditions set out in this Agreement.&rdquo; This also stipulates what happens if
a purchase order is cancelled and what happens if terms conflict between the
PO and the Agreement, and which document supersedes which.
</p>
<p>4. Supply and Delivery. This clause specifies the terms for supply and delivery of
the product or service. For instance, if there is a 10-day lead time stipulated be-
tween order placement and delivery, what happens if the supplier does not de-
liver in time? This clause may also reference an appendix that provides
additional details on how delivery is measured, what is considered on-time de-
livery, what are the penalties for late delivery, and other details.
</p>
<p>5. Specifications, Quality, and Health, Safety, Environment. This clause describes
method of manufacture and quality requirements, and may include language
specific to terms of quality (e.g., &ldquo;The Products delivered under this Agree-
ment shall be manufactured in conformity with any mandatory requirements
of applicable law in the country of origin or supply and any international stan-
dards relevant to such Products.&rdquo;). Charges for delivery of off-specification
products or services may also be identified in the appendix. For services, a

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Statement of Work contained in the appendix will provide details of the exact
scope of work to be performed and the service quality expectations. Finally,
elements associated with safety, health, and environmental standards are iden-
tified in terms of expectations from the supplier.
</p>
<p>6. Payment. This section may specify terms such as &ldquo;current price,&rdquo; &ldquo;prior
price,&rdquo; and other criteria that determine how or if prices will be adjusted over
the course of the contract. Again, details of how often prices will change and
any indices associated with pricing change agreements or related to cost-sav-
ings sharing are identified in a schedule in the appendix.
</p>
<p>7. Liability. This can sometimes be a contentious clause and may often contain
language such as &ldquo;The Supplier shall assume entire responsibility for and shall
defend, indemnify and hold Buyer and Buyer&rsquo;s Affiliates harmless against all
losses, liabilities, costs and expenses arising directly or indirectly out of or in
connection with this Agreement or any Purchase Order and arising from in-
jury or damage to the property of the Supplier.&rdquo; The clause generally specifies
who is responsible if there are injuries or damage, over the course of the con-
tract, and any damages to be paid. This may also include insurance require-
ments and subsupplier issues as they arise.
</p>
<p>8. Force Majeure. This clause describes the course of events that occurs if there
are unforeseen events such as earthquakes or hurricanes that prevent a sup-
plier from fulfilling its obligations to the buyer. Generally, this clause includes
language such as &ldquo;The party whose performance of this Agreement is so af-
fected shall notify the other party as soon as is reasonably practicable giving
the full relevant particulars and shall use its reasonable efforts to remedy the
situation immediately.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>9. Effective Date and Termination. This clause states when the contract becomes
effective, when it terminates, and any agreements relating to conditions when
the contract can be extended beyond the termination date. It also stipulates
whether either party has the ability to terminate the contract at any time, and
how much advance notice must be given.
</p>
<p>10. Intellectual Property. This clause specifies conditions regarding who owns any
intellectual property (IP) that comes out of the agreement, and who owns
what IP going into the agreement. If an innovation comes out of the agree-
ment, there may also be stipulations as to who owns the &ldquo;residuals&rdquo; of that IP.
</p>
<p>11. Assignment and Contracting. This clause stipulates whether the supplier can as-
sign its rights described in the agreement to another party, and whether sub-
contracting is permissible.
</p>
<p>12. Technology Improvements. If the buyer becomes aware of any technology or
cost improvements of other products in the market, this section may specify
whether they can share this information with the supplier, and how the sup-
plier should act on this information.
</p>
<p>13. Most Favored Customer. This clause states whether the buyer can expect to re-
ceive preferential status over the supplier&rsquo;s other customers. This is not only
difficult to measure, but also difficult to enforce, so it is not always used in
practice.
</p>
<p>14. Confidentiality. This clause ensures that all information, technology, and so
on shared between the parties remains confidential and is not shared with
other customers or suppliers.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>15. Statistics. This clause provides guidelines regarding what type of reporting sta-
tistics and measures the supplier must provide to the buyer on a regular basis,
defined clearly. Additional details may be in a schedule in the appendix.
</p>
<p>16. Key Performance Indicators and Compensation. This clause provides specific
details on how the supplier&rsquo;s performance will be measured and if any com-
pensation will be awarded by the supplier to the buyer if these defined levels
of performance are not maintained. For example, if delivery falls below 90%,
there may be a penalty the supplier will need to pay.
</p>
<p>17. Notices. This clause establishes where bills, invoices, notices, and other docu-
ments should be sent, as well as the key contact person at the buying and
supplying company to whom to direct all questions and issues concerning the
relationship.
</p>
<p>18. Severability. This clause describes how an issue will be addressed if a portion
of the agreement is void or unenforceable, and which court of law will resolve
the difference.
</p>
<p>19. Third-Party Rights. This clause stipulates that any benefits attributed to a
third party (other than the buyer and supplier) identified in the contract must
be enforced. For example, if there is a bank that handles transactions between
the two and charges a fee, this fee must be paid by the parties according to
the agreement.
</p>
<p>20. Free Trade Areas. This clause identifies any free trade issues and benefits, and
how to share the benefits.
</p>
<p>21. Minority- or Women-Owned Business Enterprises. This clause stipulates that
the supplier agrees to use its best efforts to support MWBE (Minority- and
Women-Owned Business Enterprises) purchasing or that a certain percentage
of its business must be awarded to MWBE enterprises.
</p>
<p>22. General. Any other general business principles.
</p>
<p>23. Governing Law. This clause stipulates the court of law where any disputes will
be settled. This clause contains language such as &ldquo;Mandatory application of lo-
cal law or a statement to the contrary in the relevant Purchase Order, which
is agreed to by the Supplier, shall be exclusively governed by the laws of En-
gland.&rdquo; This clause may also stipulate the use of arbitration or other forms of
conflict resolution (described later in this chapter).

<p>Services Contracts at In-
tuit Share Risk and Re-
ward with Suppliers
</p>
<p>Intuit, a premier provider of small business and personal finance software such as
Quicken and QuickBooks, decided in 2004 that to better serve the overall organization, every
contract written must go through procurement. The four contract managers who managed con-
tact centers procurement were assigned to specific business units to provide continuity and
a single point of contact. To provide consistency and ensure the coverage of all key issues, In-
tuit developed a standardized Master Service Agreement (MSA) that is used for all call cen-
ter contracts. The MSA contains all of the terms of the agreement including potential risks
and opportunities. Pricing, technology, and performance expectations are created to clearly de-
fine both supplier and Intuit responsibilities, as well as the terms for non-conformance to
the specifications. Key elements of the MSA include (1) Services, generic services to be per-
formed by the supplier with reference to the statement of work, (2) Intuit&rsquo;s Obligations,
which provides the supplier with training and licenses to software they will support during
the provision of services and other obligations, (3) Business Turndown/Upturn and Disaster
Recovery, which sets up expectations when there is a significant turn in business and sets
up planning in case there is a disaster, (4) Compensation and Payment Terms, including
early payment discount, process for disputed invoices, and maintaining financial records, (5)
Quality Control/Gain Share Opportunities, supplier requirements for QC, (6) Term/Termination,
events required to terminate the agreement prior to the term, and (7) Ownership, which out-
lines the property rights of all software, works from the agreement, and other materials.
Other terms include Confidential Information, Representation and Warranties, Indemnifica-
tion, Insurance, Limitation of Liability, Dispute Resolution, and General. Attachments to the
MSA will generally include the Statement of Work, Privacy Requirements, Security Require-
ments, Reimbursement/Expendable Items, and Amendments to the Statement of Work. The
Risk and Reward clause is a unique aspect and identifies specific performance metrics as
part of the contract to be used as a baseline. If suppliers exceed expectations on key perfor-
mance parameters, they may receive additional payments, or conversely their payments may
be adjusted if they fall short of the baseline. This is used to motivate the supplier to meet
or exceed contractual service levels and encourage continuous improvement.

<p>An example of how one company, Intuit, structured its contract master service agree-
ments is shown in Sourcing Snapshot: Services Contracts at Intuit Share Risk and Re-
ward with Suppliers. Notice that the flow of the contract provides greater and greater
detail around the expectations. Next, we describe how such contracts are developed.
</p>
<p>How to Write a Contract
Most commonly used contracts are developed from earlier contracts that are subse-
</p>
<p>quently modified to fit the situation at hand. Although this procedure minimizes the
amount of administrative effort required each time a purchase contract is written,
there is a danger in blindly assuming that all past contracts will be appropriate, partic-
ularly in dynamic environments where technology changes occur rapidly or where
there are few legal precedents. Purchasing managers should keep a contract file and re-
fer to portions of previous contracts to create a contract that uniquely fits the situa-
tion at hand.
</p>
<p>The most appropriate method of drafting a new contract is to start with a general
form (or forms) and samples of past contracts for similar situations. Purchasing man-
agers will often get advice from the legal department or appropriate counsel and cre-
ate several different general forms for the various types of purchase situations that
may be routinely encountered. Verifying the following information will help ensure
that the contract is appropriate:3
</p>
<p>&bull; The contract identifies clearly what is being bought and the cost.
</p>
<p>&bull; The contract specifies how the purchased item is going to be shipped and
delivered.
</p>
<p>&bull; The contract covers the question of how the items are to be installed (if in-
stallation is to be a part of the contract).
</p>
<p>&bull; The contract includes an acceptance provision detailing exactly how and
when the purchaser will accept the products.
</p>
<p>&bull; The contract addresses the appropriate warranties.
</p>
<p>&bull; The contract spells out remedies including liquidated damages and clauses
specifying the consequences for late performance.
</p>
<p>&bull; The contract does a good job on the &ldquo;boilerplate,&rdquo; which includes the stan-
dard terms and conditions common to all contracts and purchase agree-
ments. It is common among these clauses to include a force majeure clause
that identifies the conditions under which performance is excused. Common
items included in a force majeure clause are war, embargo, and changes in
the law.
</p>
<p>The purchasing manager should consider arbitration or other dispute resolution
mechanisms for inclusion in the contract. The advantages of arbitration are impor-
tant: Arbitration is fast and confidential, with less variance in outcome or damage
awards, and it is not appealable. It is always a good idea to double-check all attach-
ments to the contract, because many of the technical details are included there.S

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Technical sections of the contract are typically the greatest source of misinterpreta-
tion of terms and conditions. For instance, if the contract contains a clause that says,
&ldquo;This is the entire agreement,&rdquo; remember that this means exactly what it says; there
are no other additions or modifications to the agreement that are enforceable. This is
called an &ldquo;integration clause&rdquo; and should be located near the end of the contract.
</p>
<p>In developing international contracts, purchasing managers should pay particular
attention to the following details:4
</p>
<p>&bull; Forum selection. In the event of a dispute, where would the arbitration fo-
rum for resolving the dispute take place?
</p>
<p>&bull; Choice of law. The parties to an international contract should agree on the
contract law that will govern the contract in the event of a dispute.
</p>
<p>&bull; Payment. What currency will be used to make payments under the contract?
</p>
<p>&bull; Language. The contract should specify the official language to be used in the
contract, as translations are not exact.
</p>
<p>&bull; Force majeure. It is common in international contracts to excuse perfor-
mance when events take place that make performance as called for in the
contract impossible. Force majeure clauses typically excuse performance
when war, natural disasters, or political upheaval occurs.
</p>
<p>Types of Contracts
Purchasing contracts can be classified into different categories based on their char-
</p>
<p>acteristics and purpose. Almost all purchasing contracts are based on some form of
pricing mechanism and can be categorized as a variation on two basic types: fixed-
price and cost-based contracts. As described earlier, the general description of the
type of price/cost mechanism is contained in the &ldquo;Payment&rdquo; clause, but the actual de-
tails describing the specific nature of the pricing formula, cost elements, pricing in-
dex, or other elements is typically described in a schedule in the appendices. If a
specific formula-based pricing or costing model is going to be used, it is also a good
idea to include an example in the schedule that shows how the price or cost should
be calculated given the data that is available, so everyone clearly understands how the
calculation occurs. The major types of contracts are shown in Exhibit 14.1 on p. 508.
</p>
<p>Fixed-Price Contracts
</p>
<p>Firm Fixed Price
The most basic contractual pricing mechanism is called a firm fixed price. In this
</p>
<p>type of purchase contract, the price stated in the agreement does not change, regard-
less of fluctuations in general overall economic conditions, industry competition,
levels of supply, market prices, or other environmental changes. This contract price
can be obtained through any number of pricing mechanisms: price quotations, sup-
plier responses to the buying organization&rsquo;s requests for proposal, negotiations, or
any other method. Fixed-price contracts are the simplest and easiest for purchasing
to manage because there is no need for extensive auditing or additional input from
the purchasing side.
</p>
<p>If market prices for a purchased good or service rise above the stated contract
price, the seller bears the brunt of the financial loss. However, if the market price falls

</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Contract Management 507</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>below the stated contract price due to outside factors such as competition, changes
in technology, or raw material prices, the purchaser assumes the risk or financial loss.
If there is a high level of uncertainty from the supplying organization&rsquo;s point of
view regarding its ability to make a reasonable profit under competitive fixed-price
conditions, then the supplier may add to its price to cover potential increases in com-
ponent, raw material, or labor prices. If the supplier increases its contract price in an-
ticipation of rising costs, and the anticipated conditions do not occur, then the
purchaser has paid too high a price for the good or service. For this reason, it is very
important for the purchasing organization to adequately understand existing market
conditions prior to signing a fixed-price contract to prevent contingency pricing from
adversely affecting the total cost of the purchase over the life of the contract.
</p>
<p>Fixed-Price Contract with Escalation
There are a number of variations on the basic firm fixed-price contract. If the
</p>
<p>item being purchased is to be supplied over a longer time period and there is a high
probability that costs will increase, then the parties may choose to negotiate an escala-
tion clause into the basic contract, resulting in a fixed-price contract with escalation.
Escalation clauses allow either increases or decreases in the base price depending on
the circumstances. A greater degree of price protection is therefore provided for the
supplier, while the purchaser enjoys potential price reductions. All price changes
should be keyed to a third-party price index, preferably to a well-established, widely
published index (such as the Producer Price Index for a specific material).
</p>
<p>Fixed-Price Contract with Redetermination
In cases where the parties cannot accurately predict labor or material costs and quan-
</p>
<p>tities to be used prior to the execution of the purchase agreement (e.g., an unproven
technology), a fixed-price contract with redetermination may be more appropriate. In

</p>
<p>508 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>this scenario, the buying and selling parties negotiate an initial target price based on
best-guess estimates of the labor and materials to be used in manufacturing a new prod-
uct. Once a contractually agreed-upon volume of production has been reached, the two
parties review the production process and redetermine a revised firm price. Depending
on the circumstances surrounding the contract, the redetermined price may be applied
only to production following the redetermination, or it may be applied to all or part of
the units previously produced. Care should be taken, though, because a contract that
calls for an agreement to agree in the future is not enforceable.
</p>
<p>Fixed-Price Contract with Incentives
A final type of fixed-price contract is the fixed-price contract with incentives. This
</p>
<p>contract is similar to the fixed-price contract with redetermination except that the
terms and conditions of the contract allow cost-savings sharing with the supplier. As
in the redetermination contract, it is difficult for the buying and selling parties to ar-
rive at a firm price prior to actual production.
</p>
<p>If the supplier can demonstrate actual cost savings through production efficiencies
or substitution of materials, the resulting savings from the initial price targets are
shared between the supplier and the purchaser at a predetermined rate. This type of
purchase contract is typically utilized under conditions of high unit cost and rela-
tively long lead times. The sharing of cost savings may be 50/50 (or some other split
may be a negotiated part of the contract).
</p>
<p>Cost-Based Contracts
Cost-based contracts are appropriate for situations in which there is a risk that a
</p>
<p>large contingency fee might be included using a fixed-price contract. Cost-based con-
tracts typically represent a lower level of risk of economic loss for suppliers, but they
can also result in lower overall costs to the purchaser through careful contract man-
agement. It is important for the purchaser to include contractual terms and condi-
tions that require the supplier to carefully monitor and control costs. The two parties
to the agreement must agree what costs are to be included in the calculation of the
price of the goods or services procured.
</p>
<p>Cost-based contracts are generally applicable when the goods or services procured
are expensive, complex, and important to the purchasing party or when there is a
high degree of uncertainty regarding labor and material costs. Cost-based contracts
are generally less favorable to the purchasing party because the threat of financial
risk is transferred from the seller to the buyer. There is also a low incentive for the
supplier to strive to improve its operations and lower costs (and hence price) to the
purchaser. In fact, there is an incentive, at least in the short run, for suppliers to be in-
efficient in cost-based contracts because they are rewarded with higher prices.
</p>
<p>Cost Plus Incentive Fee
Another cost-based contract is the cost plus incentive fee contract. This contract is
</p>
<p>similar to the fixed-price plus incentive fee contract except that the base price de-
pends on allowable supplier costs rather than on a fixed-price basis.
</p>
<p>As before, if the supplier is able to improve efficiency or material usage as compared
with the initial target cost, then the buying and selling parties will share any cost sav-
ings at a predetermined rate. This type of contract is appropriate for cases where both
parties are relatively certain about the accuracy of the initial target cost estimates.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Cost-Sharing Contract
With pure cost-sharing contracts, allowable costs are shared between the parties
</p>
<p>on a predetermined percentage basis. The key to successful negotiation is the identifi-
cation of a firm set of operating guidelines, goals, and objectives for the contract.
When in doubt, the two parties to a cost-sharing contract need to spell out their ex-
pectations in as much detail as possible to avoid confusion and misunderstanding
regarding their respective roles and responsibilities. Cost-sharing contracts are espe-
cially important during a period when raw material prices are increasing. The con-
tract schedule detailing how both parties can share the expense of increasing input
costs can prevent major problems and may also ensure that the supplier does not go
bankrupt because of its inability to produce the product at a fixed price when the
cost of materials is going up. Sourcing Snapshot: Pricing Dispute Leads a Ford Sup-
plier to Stop Production provides a very good example of what can happen if a
strong buyer (in this case, Ford) does not work with the supplier (in this case, Col-
lins &amp; Aikman) to restructure a fixed-price contract in the face of escalating raw mate-
rial costs.
</p>
<p>Time and Materials Contract
Another cost-based contract is the time and materials contract. This type of con-
</p>
<p>tract is generally used in plant and equipment maintenance agreements, where the
supplier cannot determine accurate costs prior to the repair service. The contract

<p>Pricing Dispute Leads
a Ford Supplier to Stop
Production
</p>
<p>In a sign of the heightened tensions over sharing the financial misery in the U.S. auto
industry, parts maker Collins &amp; Aikman Corp. (C&amp;A) took the rare step of cutting off deliver-
ies to Ford Motor Co., a move that caused Ford to temporarily shut down production at an as-
sembly plant in Mexico.
</p>
<p>Collins &amp; Aikman&rsquo;s showdown with the nation&rsquo;s No. 2 automaker came in a pricing dispute
over instrument panels, carpeting, and other interior plastic parts in which several million dol-
lars were at stake, according to a person familiar with the dispute. People interviewed said
that as a result of Collins &amp; Aikman&rsquo;s action, Ford will no longer consider it for future busi-
ness but won&rsquo;t pull its existing business, at least for now.
</p>
<p>This type of contractual disagreement is not surprising, given the current environment for
U.S. automotive manufacturers. For years, Detroit&rsquo;s Big Three automakers have squeezed
their suppliers in an effort to protect their own profit margins and&mdash;more recently&mdash;to
stanch heavy losses. Ford, General Motors Corp., and Chrysler Group have wrested deep price
cuts from their supply networks and have also pushed suppliers to relocate operations to
low-cost countries like China.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The relationship has been irreparably harmed,&rdquo; says Ford spokesman Paul Wood. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very

<p>should spell out the appropriate labor rate (generally computed on a per-hour basis),
plus an overhead and profit percentage, resulting in a &ldquo;not-to-exceed&rdquo; total price.
With these terms and conditions, the purchaser has little control over the estimated
maximum price. Thus labor hours spent should be carefully audited over the life of
the contract.
</p>
<p>Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Contract
In a cost plus fixed-fee contract, the supplier receives reimbursement for all of its
</p>
<p>allowable costs up to a predetermined amount plus a fixed fee, which typically
represents a percentage of the targeted cost of the good or service being procured. Al-
though the supplier is guaranteed at least a minimal profit above its allowable costs,
there is little motivation for the supplier to dramatically improve its costs over the
life of the contract. The U.S. military has been highly criticized for using such con-
tracts on a routine basis with suppliers, which are making above-normal profits for
commonly used goods and services at the expense of taxpayers.
</p>
<p>To be most effective, cost-based contracts should include cost productivity im-
provements in order to drive continuous cost reduction over the life of the contract.
</p>
<p>Ford, which accounts for 25% of Collins &amp; Aikman&rsquo;s North American sales and is its third-
largest customer, made 400 fewer cars than it had intended to build as a result of the produc-
tion shutdown, according to the people familiar with the dispute.
</p>
<p>All three of the nation&rsquo;s big automakers are struggling to make money in North America, and
their loss of market share over the past several years has taken a heavy toll on suppliers.
Over the past year or so, parts makers have also been hurt by rising prices for commodities
such as plastic and steel, and for the most part have been unable to get the Big Three to
cover those higher costs. Contractual disputes arising from the inability to factor in pricing
agreements tied to raw material costs are largely at the root of this problem.
</p>
<p>Now, a half dozen or so of the parts industry&rsquo;s biggest companies, including Collins &amp; Aik-
man, Delphi Corp., and Tower Automotive, are operating under Chapter 11 protection and are
using the bankruptcy courts to push for better terms from the automakers, renegotiating con-
tracts for more money, exiting existing contracts, or demanding financial help from their Big
Three customers.
</p>
<p>In some cases, parts makers are taking a harder line with Detroit at the urging of hedge
funds that have invested millions in distressed automotive suppliers, betting the companies
can regain some of their pricing power.
</p>
<p>Automotive suppliers occasionally threaten not to deliver parts, but rarely follow through. The
few that do are typically very small suppliers that are close to going under. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very
rare move and very serious one. It shows there is so much tension and financial stress be-
tween automakers and suppliers,&rdquo; says James Gillette, director of supplier analysis for CSM
Worldwide, an auto-research firm.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Considerations When Selecting Contract Types
Among the more important factors to consider when negotiating with a supplier
</p>
<p>over contract type are the following (see Exhibit 14.2):
</p>
<p>1. Component market uncertainty
</p>
<p>2. Long-term agreements
</p>
<p>3. Degree of trust between buyer and seller
</p>
<p>4. Process or technology uncertainty
</p>
<p>5. Supplier&rsquo;s ability to impact costs
</p>
<p>6. Total dollar value of the purchase
</p>
<p>The first of these factors, component market uncertainty, refers to the volatility of
pricing conditions for major elements of the product, such as raw materials, pur-
chased components, and labor. The more unstable the underlying factor market
prices, either upward or downward, the less appropriate a fixed-price contract will be
for the two parties. Increasing factor market prices will place more risk on the supply-
ing organization, while decreasing such prices will shift the contract economic risk to
the purchasing party. (This condition also applies in the case of unstable currency ex-
change rates in contracts with international suppliers.)
</p>
<p>The length of the purchase agreement can also have a significant impact on the de-
sirability of different contract types. The longer the term of the purchase agreement,
the less likely firm fixed-price contracts will be acceptable to the supplier. For ongo-
ing purchase arrangements, suppliers will generally prefer to employ fixed price with
escalation or any of the cost-based contracts, because they incur less economic risk
for the selling party. Purchasing managers must therefore evaluate the economic risk
of the different contract types and make a decision as to the acceptability of each
type for the entire length of the agreement. For most short-term contracts and in con-
ditions of stable component factor markets, firm fixed and fixed-price with redetermi-
nation contracts can safely be applied. The choice of contract type is also dependent
on the nature of the buyer-seller relationship.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>If the relationship has been mutually beneficial in the past and has existed for a
considerable period of time, a greater degree of trust may have developed between
buying and selling parties. In such cases, both buyer and supplier are more likely to
cooperate in the determination of allowable costs, thereby preferring cost-based pur-
chase agreements.
</p>
<p>For products and services characterized by high process or technological uncer-
tainty, fixed-price contracts are less desirable for the seller. However, if the purchaser
has a reasonable estimate of the supplier&rsquo;s cost structure, then cost-based contracts
may be preferable because they allow the price to be adjusted either upward or down-
ward depending on the efforts of the supplier. If the supplier can potentially reduce
costs through continuous improvement, then an incentive-type contract may prove
beneficial to both contracting parties.
</p>
<p>As the total dollar value/unit cost of the contract increases, purchasers must spend
more effort creating effective pricing mechanisms. The contracting parties must con-
sider each of the factors in Exhibit 14.2 in detail, as well as the total impact of the con-
tract over the lifetime of the agreement. It is important to remember that both
parties in a contract must benefit (although not necessarily in the same proportion).
</p>
<p>Long-Term Contracts in Alliances
and Partnerships
</p>
<p>A common method of classifying industrial buying contracts is based on the
length of the contract term. Spot contracts are defined as those purchases that are
made on a nonrecurring or limited basis with little or no intention of developing an
ongoing relationship with the supplier. Short-term contracts are defined as contract pur-
chases that are routinely made over a relatively limited time horizon, typically one
year or less. Long-term contracts are contract purchases that are made on a continuing
basis for a specified or indefinite period of time, typically exceeding one year. Be-
cause long-term contracts involve greater commitments into the future, the contrac-
tual terms and conditions must be carefully developed. In this section we focus
primarily on long-term contracts, but a number of the considerations covered may ap-
ply to shorter-term agreements as well.
</p>
<p>Benefits of Long-Term Contracts
Regardless of the terminology used, almost all buyer-seller relationships have a con-
</p>
<p>tract (even if it is implied) that governs them. Even when there is no contract, most
transactions are covered by a &ldquo;gap filler&rdquo; known as the Uniform Commercial Code
(UCC), covered in the next chapter. The contract itself is a formal symbol indicating
that these joint responsibilities and expectations exist. Effective long-term contracts
(with a duration of more than one year) generally have specific and measurable objec-
tives clearly stated in them, including pricing mechanisms, delivery terms, quality
standards and improvements, productivity improvements, cost-savings sharing, ever-
green clauses, risk sharing, conflict and dispute resolution, and termination of the rela-
tionship. Because long-term contracts are increasingly being used in industry, it is
worthwhile to discuss the attributes, advantages, and risks of this approach in detail. S

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Why would a buying organization consider a long-term contract with a supplier?
In a general sense, the buyer usually expects a greater level of commitment from a sup-
plier involved in a long-term contract. Long-term contracts can also result in an op-
portunity for creating joint value between the contracting parties. Joint value can be
enhanced through the sharing of information, risk, schedules, costs, needs, and even
resources. In addition, a long-term contract serves as a blueprint or guide for the rela-
tionship between the buyer and the supplier. It typically delineates initial price,
mechanisms for price adjustments, cost-reduction expectations, intellectual properties
such as patents and copyrights, and currency adjustment procedures, as well as any
other responsibilities.
</p>
<p>There are many reasons why both buyers and suppliers would want to consider a
long-term contract (see Exhibit 14.3). These are discussed in more detail here.
</p>
<p>Assurance of Supply
Perhaps the most compelling reason to consider a long-term contract, from the
</p>
<p>buyer&rsquo;s perspective, is that such contracts may reduce the level of risk incurred if
shorter-term contracts are employed. By committing to a clearly defined, concise, and
mutually beneficial long-term agreement, buyers can reasonably assure themselves of
a continued source of supply, particularly important if the material, product, part, or
component being procured is subject to potentially severe supply disruptions or ex-
treme variations in quality, price, availability, or delivery. &ldquo;Most Favored Customer&rdquo;
clauses are especially important when committing to these types of agreements.
</p>
<p>Access to Supplier Technology
Long-term contracts can help the buyer to gain exclusive access to proprietary sup-
</p>
<p>plier technology. Blocking competitor access to this supplier technology through a
long-term exclusivity contract can result in at least a short-term competitive advan-
tage for the buyer. Tying up a supplier in the initial introductory stage of a new or dra-
matically improved technology product life cycle either forces competitors to spend
valuable time and effort searching for a comparable technology elsewhere or means
they have to develop it internally. The buying firm therefore can reach the market-
place first and establish a &ldquo;first mover&rdquo; advantage. The potential risk here is that the
buyer must be forward-looking enough to choose suppliers with the most promising
or most marketable technology, at the peril of locking themselves into the wrong tech-
nology and losing their expected competitive advantage.

<p>514 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Access to Cost / Price Information
Agreeing to a long-term contract frequently allows the buyer to have access to
</p>
<p>more detailed cost and price information from the supplier in exchange for the ex-
tended contract term. Longer-term contracts create greater incentives for suppliers to
improve or expand their processes through capital improvements because they are
able to spread their fixed costs over a larger volume. Long-term contracts should be
written to include incentive or cost-sharing arrangements (written into a schedule)
that reward the supplier for making improvements in its processes while passing
some of the cost savings along to the buyer. This additional supplier investment can
also result in higher product quality as well as lower costs. Joint buyer-seller teams
may work together to improve the supplier&rsquo;s process and divide the resulting savings.
The cost-savings sharing terms should be explicitly negotiated and written into the
contract (do not assume that the savings will automatically be divided 50/50).
</p>
<p>Volume Leveraging
A final benefit of developing a long-term contract is that the buyer can leverage
</p>
<p>his or her enhanced position to drive the supplier toward a higher rate of perfor-
mance improvement. Using the added leverage of a long-term, multiyear agreement
with the supplier, the buyer can require the supplier to increase its rate of progress
up the learning curve and pass along the savings to the buyer at an accelerated rate.
This performance improvement can be driven by additional capital investment as de-
scribed earlier, an accelerated learning curve effect, and a higher level of commitment
on behalf of the supplier. Long-term contracts with incentives are based on the no-
tion that as purchase volumes increase, cost structures change. Long-term agreements
in cases of increasing volumes should establish productivity improvement goals and
cost-savings sharing, where both buyer and seller share in cost reductions achieved.
If suppliers are not forthcoming with labor and material cost data, cost models can
be developed to improve the buyer&rsquo;s negotiating position using material/labor ratios
available from industry databases (see Chapter 11).
</p>
<p>Supplier Receives Better Information for Planning
A supplier may have several reasons for preferring a long-term contract. First, the
</p>
<p>supplier receives better scheduling information, which in turn helps the supplier&rsquo;s pro-
duction area improve efficiency and materials planning. With less uncertainty in pro-
duction schedules, the supplier&rsquo;s purchasing departments can buy material in larger
quantities, thereby obtaining volume discounts. Second, detailed projections of vol-
umes and delivery dates allow the supplier to better budget the flow of funds and in-
vestment stemming from the expectation of continued future volume. In turn, the
supplier&rsquo;s organization lowers unit costs, because fixed costs are spread out over a
larger number of units. Third, the supplier can realize lower administrative costs over
the term of the contract. Less effort is required to seek out and develop replacement
volume on an ongoing basis.
</p>
<p>Risks of Long-Term Contracts
A buyer or seller must consider a number of risks when evaluating whether a
</p>
<p>long-term contract is necessary or even desirable. Three primary questions must be
asked when developing a long-term contract and considering the risks: S

<p>Chapter 14 Contract Management 515</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1. What is the potential for opportunism? In other words, how likely is the sup-
plier to take advantage of the purchaser (or vice versa)?
</p>
<p>2. Is this the right supplier to engage in a long-term contract?
</p>
<p>3. Is there a fair distribution of risk and gains between the parties involved?
</p>
<p>Supplier Opportunism
From the buyer&rsquo;s perspective, there is a major risk that the supplier will become
</p>
<p>too complacent and lose motivation to maintain or improve performance as the con-
tract progresses. Performance deterioration can be observed in a variety of ways:
higher price, deteriorating quality and delivery, lagging technology, and increased cy-
cle times. It is important for buyers to build appropriate incentive clauses into their
long-term agreements that serve to motivate suppliers to adequately perform as ex-
pected over the term of the agreement.
</p>
<p>Selecting the Wrong Supplier
An additional risk associated with long-term contracts is the possibility that the
</p>
<p>best available supplier may not be recognized or chosen to participate in the long-
term agreement. It is the buyer&rsquo;s responsibility to conduct adequate research that
documents the supplier&rsquo;s past performance, capabilities, financial health and stability,
technology roadmap, and commitment to the relationship.
</p>
<p>Once a long-term agreement with a given supplier has been executed, it is much
more difficult (and expensive) to switch suppliers. In order to ensure a successful fu-
ture relationship, sufficient time and effort must be invested prior to signing a long-
term contract.
</p>
<p>Supplier Volume Uncertainty
To be successful, a good long-term contract considers the needs of both parties.
</p>
<p>The buyer must consider a number of issues from the supplier&rsquo;s perspective. The first
and foremost is volume uncertainty, particularly when dealing with a new product or
a new customer. Although the prospective buyer may indicate to the supplier that a
certain purchased volume level may be expected, there are many reasons why that vol-
ume might never be achieved. Possible reasons include overforecasting of require-
ments, lack of marketability of the end item, intense competition in the marketplace,
and other environmental considerations such as government regulation. A related rea-
son is that the item being supplied may be in the mature or decline phase of the prod-
uct life cycle. A long-term contract that indicates volume growth under these
circumstances is unlikely ever to be fully realized.
</p>
<p>Supplier Forgoes Other Business
Agreeing to a long-term contract that limits the supplier&rsquo;s ability to service the buy-
</p>
<p>er&rsquo;s competitors might lock the supplier out of several profitable business opportu-
nities. Also, when companies agree to supply a particular customer&rsquo;s needs, this
precludes them from taking on more profitable business with other customers later
on due to a lack of available capacity. This is particularly true in industries that are ap-
proaching full capacity.

<p>516 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Buyer Is Unreasonable
Another risk that the supplier must consider is the likelihood of the buyer making
</p>
<p>extraordinary demands once the contract has been executed. Unforeseen customer de-
mands typically result in higher costs that the supplier may or may not be able to re-
cover under the terms of the agreement.
</p>
<p>Contingency Elements of Long-Term Contracts
Effective long-term contracts contain a number of elements that allow for contin-
</p>
<p>gencies that may arise during the course of the contract.
</p>
<p>Initial Price
A buyer must focus intently on determining an acceptable initial price because
</p>
<p>over the course of a long-term contract the price adjustment mechanism will use the
initial price as the base for future adjustments. An initial price that is too high will
cause all following prices to be too high. A buyer needs to be aware that some suppli-
ers often front-load their initial price by including excess profits, which inflates all fu-
ture prices. Likewise, if the initial price is too low, then the supplier may not be
motivated to perform as expected because all future prices will be too low and unprof-
itable. In a long-term contract the relationship between the parties is immaterial un-
less both parties gain something during the course of the exchange.
</p>
<p>Price-Adjustment Mechanisms
Selecting an appropriate price-adjustment mechanism is also a key consideration
</p>
<p>in a long-term contract. If future price adjustments are linked to an outside index or
the price of a related product, then care should be exercised in selecting which index
or related product is to be used. Choice of the wrong index or related product can
also result in higher prices over the term of the agreement.
</p>
<p>Supplier Performance Improvements
Buyers should use long-term agreements to obtain specific supplier performance
</p>
<p>improvements over time. Again, this compels the buyer to conduct extensive research
regarding the supplier&rsquo;s capabilities and past performance, as well as determining the
types and levels of risk that might be associated with a particular long-term supply
contract. Managers must decide whether the contract should be written for a specific
period such as three or five years, or whether the contract should be a series of roll-
ing contracts with an evergreen clause, which renews the agreement at the end of ev-
ery period.
</p>
<p>Evergreen, Penalty, and Escape Clauses
An evergreen clause assumes the contract will be renewed every year unless the
</p>
<p>supplier is otherwise notified that this is not the case. An effective evergreen clause
should be based on a periodic joint review period, typically one year or shorter, and
should incorporate a point system that rewards the supplier for acceptable perfor-
mance. In cases when expectations are not met, the purchasing manager may request
specific corrective action and may even charge back lost time and expenses to the
supplier. S
</p>
<p>N
L
</p>
<p>E4575-MONCZKA_Ch14_Rev1 6/11/08 6:07:35pm 517 of 537 cyan = PMS3292
</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Contract Management 517</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Associated with the evergreen clause is an escape clause, which allows the buyer
(and possibly the supplier) to terminate the contract if either side fails to live up to
contractual requirements. However, a long-term contract will usually contain terms
and conditions that call for a corrective action process if the supplier continually fails
to meet its contractual performance requirements. In such a scenario, the buyer must
first notify the supplier within a particular time period if the supplier&rsquo;s performance
has not met expectations. The supplier will have a specific time period to take correc-
tive action to bring quality, delivery, and responsiveness to acceptable levels. If the
supplier has not achieved contractually acceptable levels of performance within the
specified time period, then the buyer can terminate the contract without recourse.
Long-term contracts should also contain appropriate clauses covering conflict resolu-
tion, termination of the agreement, and handling of unanticipated requirements.
Such contingency planning may prolong the contract negotiation period up front but
may prove to be invaluable later on down the line should problems occur.
</p>
<p>Nontraditional Contracting
In addition to long-term contracts, companies must also create special types of con-
</p>
<p>tracts with information systems providers, consultants, minority business owners,
and service providers. All of these purchases require unique contractual approaches.
</p>
<p>IT Systems Contracts
Systems contracts, also known as systems outsourcing, are designed to provide ac-
</p>
<p>cess to expensive computer networks and software that single companies are unable
to afford on their own. Examples of systems contractors include SAP, Oracle, IBM,
and EDS.
</p>
<p>Subcontracting information technology (IT) requirements to an outside service
provider is a major contractual issue for companies. Both legal and purchasing execu-
tives from the company should bring their expertise to the table on issues that repre-
sent a major cost and commitment for the enterprise. Unfortunately, IT departments
often enter into such agreements on the basis of technical evaluation without the bene-
fit of input from purchasing or legal, and later pay in the form of higher costs or
poor service requirements contained in the &ldquo;fine print.&rdquo; Prior to committing to an out-
sourcing contract with such a service provider, a systems outsourcing team should
consider the length of the proposed agreement, the role of company growth or down-
sizing, service provider defaults or contract amendments, data security, control of out-
sourcing costs, and control of information systems operations. A number of other
issues pertain to IT systems contracting.
</p>
<p>Systems Contracting Risks
One of the leading causes for failure of systems contracts is that purchasers be-
</p>
<p>come locked into price structures that do not adequately reflect changes occurring
since the agreement was originally signed. Examples of such changes include dra-
matic shifts in user demand patterns, dramatically reduced costs for services pro-
vided, and quantum leaps in software and hardware technology.

<p>518 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Level of Service
The extent that a systems supplier becomes involved in the buying firm&rsquo;s opera-
</p>
<p>tion is determined by three basic levels of service: (1) turnkey, (2) modular, and (3)
shared. In the turnkey approach, the client company essentially turns over the entire
outsourced service at a given point in time. The outsource service provider performs
100% of that function for the buying organization. In the modular approach, the out-
source service provider takes on only two or three small functions from the client,
using a stepping-stone approach. As the service provider and the client company be-
come more at ease with each other and a higher level of trust develops, additional ser-
vices are shifted from the client to the service provider. In the shared approach, the
service provider and the client company share resources and operational control over
the outsourced service. Under the best of conditions, outsourcing systems contracts re-
mains a risky proposition due to the nature of uncertainty associated with the transac-
tion. Purchaser negotiations should focus on price, performance, and procedures.
</p>
<p>Price
Purchasers should consider negotiating a fixed, all-inclusive fee instead of relying
</p>
<p>on a flexible pricing system that may or may not accurately reflect changing business
conditions. If future changes are anticipated, then the purchaser should carefully
think how contract prices should be set to reflect those changes. Critical pricing is-
sues include the payment method and timing, scheduling of workloads, and report-
ing. There should also be an auditing process to ensure that the work carried out was
billed at the appropriate rate and that the right personnel associated with a work rate
actually completed the work.
</p>
<p>Performance Criteria
Performance considerations for a systems contract should, at a minimum, include
</p>
<p>specification of the overall business requirements required by the service provider.
The acceptance test criteria should be specified before issuing the contract so that
both parties completely understand how the outsourcing system is expected to per-
form. A primary concern for the purchaser is the development of a measurement sys-
tem for evaluating the service provider over the course of system development.
</p>
<p>A major concern with many outsourced system contracts today is that much of
this work is going overseas to countries such as India. Programming, call centers,
and software design are increasingly being performed by lower-cost workers in these
countries. To ensure that the work is performed according to specific criteria, many
enterprises are adopting the Software Capability Maturity Model developed by the
Software Development Institute and Carnegie Mellon University. This model ensures
that the provider complies with specific criteria measuring elements of software devel-
opment performance.
</p>
<p>The more specific the purchaser can be in providing clear goals and objectives for
the service provider to meet, the less likely it is that misunderstandings and conflicts
will result.
</p>
<p>Procedures
In addition to acceptance criteria, systems contracts should also provide a com-
</p>
<p>plete conversion plan that details the steps to be taken in converting from an in-
house system to the outsourced system. Again, the more specific the purchaser can

<p>be in providing this information, the less likely it is that serious problems will occur
later. Also, the purchaser should be careful in specifying how to handle technological
changes. Updates to the system may often be excessive, so language in the contract
needs to be included that specifies the cost of such updates. It is the joint responsibil-
ity of the purchasing manager and the supplier to ensure that the technology pro-
vided remains current with future needs. Various types of information requirements
planning techniques can be beneficial in the earliest systems-planning stages to make
sure that the system will actually meet user needs.5

<p>Minority- and Women-Owned Business
Enterprise Contracts
</p>
<p>There have been programs to stimulate growth of minority-owned businesses in
the United States since the late 1960s. The term &ldquo;minority-owned suppliers&rdquo; is used
by the U.S. federal government to describe a company that is at least 51% owned by
minorities such as African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, or
Asian-Pacific Americans (at one time that status also applied to enterprises that were
more than 50% owned by women).
</p>
<p>Women-owned businesses and firms that are owned by physically disabled people
are separate classes of firms with unique designations. The following federal actions
were carried out to promote minority-owned businesses:
</p>
<p>&bull; Executive Order 11485 (1969): Established by the U.S. Office of Minority
Business Enterprise within the Department of Commerce for the purpose of
mobilizing federal resources to aid minorities in business.
</p>
<p>&bull; Executive Order 11625 (1971): Gives the secretary of commerce the author-
ity to implement federal policy in support of minority business enterprise
programs, to provide technical and management assistance to disadvantaged
businesses, and to coordinate activities between all federal departments to
aid in increasing minority business development.
</p>
<p>&bull; Executive Order 11246 (1965): Requires that all contractors that do more
than $50,000 worth of business with the federal government must have affir-
mative action programs for each job category that is under-represented by
minorities. &ldquo;Under-representation&rdquo; is defined by the 4/5ths Rule, which is
the ratio of minority job incumbents relative to their population in the rele-
vant labor market relative to the ratio of nonminorities relative to their popu-
lation, for each job category. If that ratio falls below 0.8 (4/5ths), then the
company must report to the government its plans for remedying the under-
representation.

<p>Consulting Contracts
A knowledgeable consultant can often provide an objective point of view and con-
</p>
<p>tribute to an analysis of a situation that is not biased in favor of a predetermined solu-
tion. An important factor to consider when hiring an outside consultant to perform
contract services for a company is that such a person is the purchasing company&rsquo;s
agent, not its employee. The distinction is critical because as an agent, the consultant
will often maintain ownership of any intellectual properties developed during the con-
sultation. As such, language must be specified in the contract that the intellectual
property shared remains with the buyer. Another important element of discussion is
regarding &ldquo;residuals.&rdquo; A residual is new intellectual property (such as tools, methodol-
ogies, and knowledge) developed as the result of the interaction between the enter-
prise and the consulting company. Some companies (such as the Bank of America
and others) have specific language in the contract that requires that any residuals cre-
ated through the contract remain the property of the buyer. This prevents the consul-
tant from taking this knowledge and selling it to a competitor, thereby eliminating
the competitive advantage. Further information on best practices for structuring con-
sulting contracts from a recent study is shown in Sourcing Snapshot: Best Practices
in Consulting Contracts.

<p>Best Practices in Consult-
ing Contracts
</p>
<p>A benchmarking study of how different companies manage professional services and
consulting contracts was performed by a team of students and faculty at the Supply Chain Re-
source Cooperative (scrc.ncsu.edu). The study found that 66% of the participating compa-
nies used some sort of standardized contractual agreement/form/policy/process for the
procurement of professional services. Of those companies that use a standardized contrac-
tual agreement/form/policy/process for the procurement of professional services, all of the
companies indicated that every element of the agreement/form/policy/process is useful. An-
other similarity in the data is that none of the participating companies use a different agree-
ment/form/policy/process when procuring professional services for the first time. Furthermore,
66% of the survey respondents indicate that their company&rsquo;s procurement agreement/form/
policy/process does not change when urgency becomes an issue (e.g., the company uses a
unique process when acquiring immediate services versus those services that are not re-
quired until some time in the future). Moreover, 66% of the survey respondents have in-
centives available to ensure compliance with their company&rsquo;s formal agreement/form/policy/
process (e.g., incentive to use preferred suppliers). Finally, 66% of the participating compa-
nies use a formal pricing method (e.g., job-specific price list, price scale, or hourly rate) for
the procurement of professional services. When responding to the question &ldquo;What percentage
of professional services are purchased from this predetermined/prenegotiated list?&rdquo; 33% indi-
cated 80%, 33% indicated less than 40%, and none applied for the rest of the respondents.

<p>not the individual, because of the &ldquo;works made for hire&rdquo; concept under U.S. copy-
right law&mdash;would own the copyright. One of the legal means to distinguish an inde-
pendent contractor consultant from an employee is the presence of a written contract
that describes the consultant&rsquo;s expected services and the ability to produce the results
of the consultation. Also, if the company does not withhold income taxes, the consul-
tant will normally be viewed as an independent contractor, not an employee.
</p>
<p>Consultants will typically consider the following six goals when negotiating a con-
sulting contract for their services:6
</p>
<p>&bull; Avoidance of misunderstanding
</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance of working independence and freedom
</p>
<p>&bull; Assurance of work
</p>
<p>&bull; Assurance of payment
</p>
<p>&bull; Avoidance of liability
</p>
<p>&bull; Prevention of litigation
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important clause of a consulting contract is the assurance of
payment.
</p>
<p>Typical consulting contracts will demand a large down payment, perhaps as much
as one third of the total amount. There are a range of options for payment of the bal-
ance due, including percentage of work accomplished and time elapsed. Due to the ex-
tensive litigative climate in the business world, contracts written by the consultant
will seek to minimize the consultant&rsquo;s exposure to liability and subsequent potential
litigation. Language in this section of the contract should spell out exactly what the
consultant is and is not liable for. Consultants will try to identify those circumstances
that may cause the project to fail and for which they will disavow any responsibility.
</p>
<p>There are two general causes for litigation arising from a principal-client relation-
ship. The first concerns belief on the purchaser&rsquo;s part that the consulting work was
not completed in full, within a reasonable time, or properly. The second concern is
when the consultant fails to receive the entire fee that he or she believes was due and
proper. Consultants will typically avoid litigation whenever possible to avoid negative
public relations. Payment clauses, down payments, and installment payments usually
include the following terms and conditions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Payment on delivery of the final report
</p>
<p>&bull; Late-payment penalties
</p>
<p>&bull; A negotiable promissory note or a collateralized promissory note
</p>
<p>&bull; The inclusion of an arbitration agreement, so that disputes can be resolved
quickly and expertly. Arbitrators are specialized, and a contract can call for
selection of arbitrators among specialists. Arbitration agreements generally
call for confidentiality and for rapid, nonappealable decisions, which can
sometimes salvage a business relationship between the client-business and
the consultant, whereas such a relationship is unlikely to survive protracted
court litigation.
</p>
<p>To summarize, it is critical that purchasing develop a standard contract template/
format for all consulting/professional services and ensure that users comply with the
use of this template. Adoption of a standard contract template provides visibility re-
garding a company&rsquo;s policy to all potential consultants. Some companies have an

<p>online format that can be downloaded from the company intranet, which ensures
that all service-level agreements are built-in. The entire scope of the project should
be defined at this level, with emphasis on the various elements of the scope as inde-
pendent clauses in the contract. These should include deliverables, deadlines, budget,
and so on. If a company utilizes an incentive system to reward or penalize suppliers,
it should also be built into the contract. Finally, the contract should allow for renegoti-
ation in case of major scope changes.
</p>
<p>Construction Contracts
Many construction contracts involve the owner/purchaser seeking bids from ap-
</p>
<p>proximately four or five contractors. A typical sequence of events starts with the
owner/purchaser determining a base of preferred contractor bidders. The bidders are
then contacted prior to distribution of the bid package to ascertain if they are inter-
ested in preparing a competitive bid for the proposed construction project. Following
the distribution of the bid requests, the purchaser usually holds a prebid meeting
with interested bidders to answer any questions that they may have regarding the ini-
tial bid documents. All future questions are then submitted to the purchaser in writ-
ing to prevent any misunderstanding.
</p>
<p>All final bid submissions should consider the stated completion period. The pur-
chaser should require that all bid submissions break the total price into different
costs by type, phase, or area. The purchaser should also provide guidance to the bid-
ders regarding how the bidders&rsquo; indirect costs are to be applied. Contractor overhead
costs can be segregated into several categories based on the chosen method of cost al-
location or recovery. The following are the most common categories:
</p>
<p>&bull; Payroll taxes and insurance premiums
</p>
<p>&bull; Field project overhead
</p>
<p>&bull; Home office overhead
</p>
<p>Construction safety requirements are an important aspect of any construction con-
tract. In selecting from a group of bidders who have already qualified because of past
safety performance for the project, the following guidelines should be followed:7
</p>
<p>1. Make a thorough review of each bidder&rsquo;s written construction safety plan.
</p>
<p>2. Before the final selection is made, refer to each bidder&rsquo;s previous injury experi-
ence to determine if it is current and if any areas need improvement because
of an excessive number of one type of injury from the same hazard. Check
with government sources such as OSHA to see if there have been any recent ci-
tations of the bidder and what corrective measures are required. Calls to the
state worker compensation authorities may be a good check to determine if
there are any claims that have been filed against the contractor for failure to
complete work in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>3. Make a site visit to current projects on which bidders are working to see first-
hand the day-to-day quality and functioning of each bidder&rsquo;s construction
safety program. References from past clients should also be researched in
detail.
</p>
<p>In all of these cases, the purchaser is seeking to determine whether senior man-
agers in the firm have established an accountability system under which supervisors
at all levels are held accountable for their subordinates&rsquo; accidents. Previous research

<p>about the effect of top management on safety in construction has found that safety
had to be a goal of top management in order for others in the firm to take it seri-
ously. A buyer of construction services who maintains a &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; policy through
the use of &ldquo;hold-harmless&rdquo; clauses is in for a surprise if an accident occurs; the only
way to guarantee reduced liability for accidents is to ensure that fewer accidents
occur.8
</p>
<p>Once a construction contract has been completed, a monthly job cost summary
can be used to identify the contractor&rsquo;s total costs. An actual cost system records the
amounts actually expended, while a standard cost system estimates what the cost
should be based on known parameters. Any claims presented by the contractor must
be carefully scrutinized, as the claimed costs may not actually be incurred costs.
</p>
<p>Contractors must be able to substantiate their costs by producing records consis-
tently maintained in the normal course of business.
</p>
<p>Purchasers can minimize the likelihood of contractor claims through a number of
actions. The first is the presence of a realistic timetable that takes into account foresee-
able delays due to factors beyond the control of either the contractor or the pur-
chaser. A second action involves setting clear specifications that define exactly what
is to be constructed. Last, the design documents created by the architect should be
complete and up-to-date, reflecting any and all changes as they occur. If the contrac-
tor presents a claim against the purchaser, the purchaser should insist on the follow-
ing information, at a minimum, to help determine the accuracy and appropriateness
of the contractor&rsquo;s actual costs in the claim:
</p>
<p>&bull; A breakdown of the claim by dollar amounts into the greatest possible num-
ber of components
</p>
<p>&bull; A detailed outline of the derivation of all hourly rates, equipment costs, over-
head, and profit
</p>
<p>&bull; The underlying assumptions on which the claim is based to help ensure that
the claim is not inflated
</p>
<p>Contract administrators for construction projects may also wish to employ penalty
clauses to avoid prolonged delays in the construction schedule. Technically, penalty
clauses are called &ldquo;liquidated damages clauses.&rdquo; If they are labeled &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; clauses,
there is a long line of cases that says they are not enforceable. For instance, a liqui-
dated damages fee of $100 to $1,000 per day for every day late can provide strong in-
centives to the construction firm to meet schedules.
</p>
<p>Other Types of Contracts
Some of the other types of contracts that may be encountered by purchasers in-
</p>
<p>clude the following.
</p>
<p>Purchasing Agreements
Agreements that group similar items together for procurement help to reduce the
</p>
<p>amount of paperwork for numerous and repetitive small orders. Purchasing agree-
ments also increase the buyer&rsquo;s negotiating clout with the supplier by leveraging its
volume of business. There are a number of variations of purchasing agreements:
</p>
<p>&bull; Annual contracts: Generally run for a 12-month period and may or may not
come up for renewal at the end of the year.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; National contracts: Specify that the purchaser will buy a certain amount of
goods and services for the duration of the agreement.
</p>
<p>&bull; Corporate agreements: Specify that business units within a corporate organi-
zation must buy from specific suppliers during the term of the agreement.
</p>
<p>&bull; National buying agreements: Nonbinding on either the purchaser or the sup-
plier; typically provide discounts to corporate buyers based on total volume
for the corporation as a whole, not for any subunits individually.
</p>
<p>&bull; Blanket orders: Typically cover many different items that can be purchased
under the same purchase order number, thereby minimizing repetitive paper-
work in the purchasing department for relatively low-cost items (e.g., office
supplies).
</p>
<p>&bull; Pricing agreements: Occur in situations in which a buyer is allowed to auto-
matically discount the published purchase price by a negotiated percentage
for all purchases from a given price list or catalog during the contract
period.
</p>
<p>&bull; Open-ended orders: Similar to blanket orders but allow the addition of
items not originally included in the blanket order; may also allow the origi-
nal purchase order to be extended for a longer term.
</p>
<p>Online Catalogs and E-Commerce Contracts
Coupled with the growing trend toward longer-term agreements and consolidated
</p>
<p>purchasing agreements, many firms have turned to electronic commerce in order to
further reduce their administrative overhead. The use of automated online catalogs
by major suppliers of MRO items such as Staples, Grainger, and OfficeMax allows
users to buy directly from blanket orders and national contracts from their desktop.
Such transactions are facilitated by operating resource management systems such as
Ariba and Commerce One.
</p>
<p>Despite the recent laws validating electronic signatures on contracts, many firms
are wary of using electronic contracts and related documents because of a perceived
lack of control regarding who is authorized to represent the firm. There are four ma-
jor issues that buyers and sellers need to be aware of with respect to e-commerce
contract:9
</p>
<p>1. Parity between electronic and paper records. Unless online agreements are en-
forced, little e-commerce will take place. The prospect of treating electronic
records the same as paper records is opposed by many groups. &ldquo;Record&rdquo; is
the legal term now used to replace &ldquo;document&rdquo; or &ldquo;writing.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>2. Enforceability of shrinkwrap, clickwrap, and boxtop agreements and licenses.
In many situations, buyers are bound by agreements that are appended to the
basic transaction (purchases of goods or transfers of computer software) that
have significant legal effects that are not apparent to purchasers at the time of
purchase.
</p>
<p>3. Attribution procedures. With electronic (mouse-click) purchases, a vendor
needs secure mechanisms to be assured that an order received is legitimate.
The vendor also wants a procedure that legally points to an individual so that
individual&rsquo;s credit card can be debited by the vendor. Accompanying con-
cerns revolve around the conditions under which a vendor can sue a person
for an order received online from a website visitor.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4. Digital signatures. With standard paper contracts, signatures have operated to
uniquely identify parties to a contract. Recent legislation by Congress at-
tempts to provide several acceptable substitutes for traditional signatures in
electronic commerce, but not without some remaining concerns. Article 2 of
the UCC is being revised to accommodate e-commerce issues.
</p>
<p>Settling Contractual Disputes
All contracts, no matter how carefully worded and prepared, can be subject to
</p>
<p>some form of dispute or disagreement. It is virtually impossible to negotiate a con-
tract that anticipates every potential source of disagreement between buyer and seller.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the more complex the nature of the contract and the greater
the dollar amounts involved, the more likely it is that a future dispute over interpreta-
tion of the terms and conditions will occur. Purchasing managers must therefore at-
tempt to envision the potential for such conflicts and prepare appropriate conflict-
resolution mechanisms to deal with such problems should they arise (see Exhibit
14.4). Sourcing Snapshot: Online Dispute Resolution also describes a more recent ap-
plication of e-commerce technology, where companies are beginning to use online dis-
pute resolution websites to manage contractual conflicts.
</p>
<p>The traditional mechanism for resolving contract disputes is grounded in commer-
cial law, which provides a legal jurisdiction in which an impartial judge can hear the
facts of the case at hand and render a decision in favor of one party or the other.
</p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty, cost, and length of time required to settle a dispute in the
U.S. legal system, most buyers and sellers prefer to avoid the problems associated
with litigation and deal with the situation in other ways. Taking a dispute into the ju-
risprudence system should be viewed as a last resort, not an automatic step in resolv-
ing contractual disputes.
</p>
<p>Legal Alternatives
New methods of settling buyer-seller disputes have evolved in the last several
</p>
<p>years. These techniques, although diverse in form and nature, have a number of simi-
lar characteristics:10

<p>&bull; They exist somewhere between the polar alternatives of doing nothing and
escalating conflict.
</p>
<p>&bull; They are less formal and generally more private than ritualized court battles.
</p>
<p>&bull; They permit people with disputes to have more active participation and
more control over the processes for solving their own problems than tradi-
tional methods of dealing with conflict.
</p>
<p>&bull; Almost all of the new methods have been developed in the private sector, al-
though courts and administrative agencies have begun to borrow and adapt
some of the more successful techniques.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the simplest method of resolving a contractual disagreement involves
straightforward, face-to-face negotiation between the two parties involved. Fre-
quently, there are other factors surrounding the dispute that can be brought into con-
sideration by the parties, even though these factors are not directly involved in the
dispute at hand. For example, if the buying and selling parties to a contract disagree
on the interpretation of the contract&rsquo;s terms and conditions regarding delivery, then
perhaps they might be able to collaborate on other terms and conditions such as
price or scheduling.
</p>
<p>When this alternative is exhausted, both parties may become aware of the fact
that it is infeasible to agree on suitable alternatives. In such cases, it may be virtually
impossible for the parties to negotiate an acceptable resolution of the dispute on a
good-faith basis without additional assistance from outside parties.
</p>

</p>
<p>Online Dispute Resolution
</p>
<p>As with other aspects of the Internet, innovation in online dispute resolution (ODR) has
been rapid. Cybersettle.com is an online mechanism for settling disputes, particularly those
that involve insurance companies. Not surprisingly, there are other online vendors offering
both mediation and arbitration services. For mediation, there is Online Mediation (www
.onlineresolution.com) and MediationNow (www.mediationnow.com). Online arbitration ser-
vices include Online Resolution&mdash;Arbitration (www.onlinesolution.com/index-ow.cfm). Accord-
ing to the latter&rsquo;s website, &ldquo;Online Arbitration is similar to traditional arbitration, except that
all communications take place online. The Online Arbitrator appointed for your case will be
an experienced professional, who knows the subject area of your dispute.&rdquo; One advantage of
ODR is that through use of the computer, rather than personal appearances, the costs of &ldquo;at-
tending&rdquo; negotiations, mediation, and arbitration proceedings are lower. However, it is impor-
tant to bear in mind that most mechanisms for resolving disputes online are unfamiliar to
many businesses. For ODR to serve as an effective mechanism, both parties must agree to
use ODR, even though parties unfamiliar with the process will be cautious in trying such a
&ldquo;new&rdquo; procedure. In order for them to be enforceable, courts must accept ODR results. In at
least one case, a federal district court refused to be bound by the results of a proceeding.

<p>Arbitration
The use of an outside arbitrator, or third party, to help settle contractual disputes
</p>
<p>is the fastest-growing method of conflict resolution among contracting parties, both
in the United States and overseas. Because of the parties&rsquo; inability to reach a negoti-
ated settlement, emotional reactions to the problem (frustration, disappointment, and
anger) may prevent rational examination of the true underlying causes of the source
of disagreement.
</p>
<p>The only solution in such cases may be arbitration, which is defined as &ldquo;the submis-
sion of a disagreement to one or more impartial persons with the understanding that
the parties will abide by the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision.&rdquo;11 If set up and handled properly, ar-
bitration can serve to protect the interests of both parties to the dispute because it is
relatively inexpensive, less time consuming, private, and typically a reasonable solu-
tion for all involved.
</p>
<p>When writing and negotiating purchase contracts, many purchasing managers in-
clude an arbitration clause in the boilerplate terms and conditions. Such a clause typi-
cally spells out how the disputing parties will choose an appropriate arbitrator and
the types of disputes for which arbitration will be considered. A good source for com-
mercial arbitrators is the American Arbitration Association, which can also handle
the administrative burden of the entire process from an impartial point of view. It is
important to ensure that the arbitrator&rsquo;s opinion will be binding on both parties to
the dispute. A key point to remember here is that adequate advance planning for po-
tential disputes can prevent significant problems later should an unforeseen conflict
arise. Also, it is a good idea to spell out the location and method of conducting the ar-
bitration hearings, particularly if the dispute involves companies or individuals from
different states or countries.
</p>
<p>When preparing the purchase contract or purchase order, contract managers
should consider two factors (in conjunction with the organization&rsquo;s legal counsel), to
ensure that the ruling of an arbitrator will be legally binding:
</p>
<p>&bull; State statutes must be reviewed to determine whether the state or states in
question do in fact have such legal provisions allowing arbitration.
</p>
<p>&bull; Wording of the arbitration clause should be developed carefully in accor-
dance with state law, federal law (the Federal Arbitration Act), and the guide-
lines published by the American Arbitration Association.
</p>
<p>Purchasing managers wishing to take advantage of the process in their dealings
with suppliers should understand several caveats regarding binding arbitration.
</p>
<p>Purchasers cannot rely on an arbitration clause contained in their forms, particu-
larly if the supplier&rsquo;s forms do not contain such a clause. If the supplier&rsquo;s forms con-
tain an arbitration clause that is not in the buyer&rsquo;s forms, and the buyer does not
want to follow it, the supplier cannot rely on the presence of such a clause. Finally, if
both the buying and selling organizations&rsquo; forms contain arbitration clauses, arbitra-
tion will become an enforceable part of the overall agreement.
</p>
<p>Other Forms of Conflict Resolution
Along with the rising popularity of arbitration between buyers and sellers, a number
</p>
<p>of different forms of conflict resolution have been introduced. When people think of the
arbitration process, the process that generally comes to mind is mediation&mdash;an interven-
tion between conflicting parties to promote reconciliation, settlement, or compromise.

ties, ruling on the appropriateness of documents and other evidence, and rendering
judgment on a solution that reconciles the legitimate interests of both disputing par-
ties. Mediation varies from arbitration in that arbitration is binding on the parties. In
the mediation process, however, the disputing parties preserve their right of final deci-
sion on the solution proffered by the mediator.
</p>
<p>The second type of dispute resolution mechanism is called a minitrial, which is
not actually a trial at all. The minitrial is a form of presentation, involving an ex-
change of information between managers from each organization involved in the
dispute.
</p>
<p>Once the executives hear both sides of the presentation, they then attempt to re-
solve the dispute through negotiation with their executive counterparts. Because mini-
trials are generally more complicated than other forms of negotiation, they are
typically used when the dispute between the parties is significant and highly complex.
One of the benefits of such a process is that it turns a potential legal conflict into a
business decision and promotes a continuing relationship between the parties.
</p>
<p>Another related conflict-resolution mechanism is the &ldquo;rent-a-judge,&rdquo; which is a
popular name given to the process by which a court refers a lawsuit pending between
the parties to a private, neutral party. The neutral party (often a retired judge) con-
ducts a &ldquo;trial&rdquo; as though it were conducted in a real court. If one or both of the par-
ties is dissatisfied with the outcome of the rent-a-judge decision, then the verdict can
be appealed through normal appellate channels. In this process, the parties agree to
hire a private referee to hear the dispute. Unlike the binding arbitration process,
rent-a-judge hearings are subject to legal precedents and rules of evidence.
</p>
<p>A final alternative to dispute litigation and dispute resolution that is gaining popu-
larity is dispute prevention, a key factor in the concept of collaborative business re-
lationships such as long-term contracting, partnering, and strategic alliances. When
contracting parties initially agree to dispute-prevention processes, a progressive sched-
ule of negotiation, mediation, and arbitration followed by litigation as a last resort
can be defined and delineated in the agreement. The &ldquo;baring of souls&rdquo; involved in
this type of close, collaborative relationship dictates that the two parties fully recog-
nize and agree upon the mechanisms for dispute resolution that are to be utilized un-
der certain conditions.
</p>
<p>There are a number of factors to consider when deciding which dispute-resolution
mechanism to use. The first, and perhaps foremost, consideration is the status of the
relationship between the parties in the dispute. In cases where the relationship be-
tween the parties is ongoing and expected to continue for the foreseeable future, the
disagreeing parties will prefer to resolve the contract dispute through means that
hopefully will preserve the relationship.
</p>
<p>The choice of mechanism should also be based on the type of outcome desired by
the purchaser. There may be a need to establish an appropriate precedent to govern
the purchaser&rsquo;s actions in future disputes as well as the one at hand. Another consider-
ation is whether the disputing parties need to be directly involved in generating the
outcome or resolution. The presence of the disputing parties is important to success-
fully resolving disputes using techniques such as negotiation, arbitration, mediation,
minitrials, and rent-a-judge proceedings. Active participation by all parties involved
in a dispute generally results in a more equitable and harmonious resolution (as op-
posed to having third parties such as attorneys involved).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The level of emotion displayed by the principals is another important consider-
ation. If emotions such as anger and frustration are high, the total cost of liti-
gation, in terms of time, money, and management effort, may be more significant
than originally anticipated. For example, the situation shown in Sourcing Snapshot:
Leaking Capacitors Create Problems for PC Manufacturers has many different par-
ties involved, with a lot of &ldquo;finger-pointing,&rdquo; and may well indeed require the use
of an international mediator to sort out the source of responsibility for the prob-
lem at hand.
</p>

<p>Leaking Capacitors Create
Problems for PC
Manufacturers
</p>
<p>It has all the elements of a good thriller: a stolen secret formula, bungled corporate es-
pionage, untraceable goods, and lone wolves saving the little guy from the misdeeds of multi-
national corporations. In this case, a mistake in the stolen formulation of the electrolyte in a
capacitor has wrecked hundreds of PCs and may wreck still more in what is an industrywide
problem.
</p>
<p>Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with a low equivalent series resistance (ESR) are high-
capacitance components that generally serve to smooth out the power supply to chips.
Throughout 2002, they were breaking open and failing in certain desktop PCs. Motherboard
and PC makers stopped using the faulty parts, but because the parts can fail over a period
of several months, more such failures are expected.
</p>
<p>It is clear now that a faulty electrolyte is to blame for the burst capacitors. The mystery is:
Where did it come from and which manufacturers used it? Citing Japanese sources, initial re-
ports claimed that major Taiwanese capacitor firms, including the island&rsquo;s market leaders, Le-
lon Electronics Corp. and Luxon Electronics Corp., had turned out faulty products. But both
companies have denied the accusations.
</p>
<p>Most of the leaking capacitors pulled from bad boards in the United States, according to re-
pair people, were labeled Tayeh, not a brand affiliated with known capacitor makers. Many
others were unmarked. Some, however, did bear the trademarks of Taiwanese passive compo-
nents firms such as Jackcon Capacitor Electronics Co. (Taipei). Jackcon claims that it has
been out of the motherboard market for two years but received some complaints from U.S.
consumers in 2002. Jackcon blames the motherboard design and remains confident in the
quality of Jackcon products. According to Jackcon executives, the company&rsquo;s low-ESR capaci-
tors passed quality tests at the Industrial Technology Research Institute, a nonprofit R&amp;D or-
ganization partly funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taipei), which is also often the
source of Taiwanese firms&rsquo; electrolyte formulas.
</p>
<p>The origins of the motherboard malaise seem to provide a lesson in how not to commit corpo-
rate espionage. According to a source in Taiwan, a scientist stole the formula for an electro-
lyte from his employer in Japan and began using it himself at the Chinese branch of a
Taiwanese electrolyte manufacturer. He or his colleagues then sold the formula to an electro-
lyte maker in Taiwan, which began producing it for Taiwanese and possibly other capacitor
firms. Unfortunately, the formula as sold was incomplete.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The harsh experience of a prolonged court battle has convinced more than one set
of potential litigants to consider less costly and more timely dispute-resolution
alternatives.
</p>
<p>The importance of speed in obtaining a resolution can be a factor determining
whether to litigate, mediate, or arbitrate. In many instances the alternatives to court
adjudication are quicker than litigation. Time pressures may force the disputing par-
ties to be more creative and understanding in reaching an appropriate resolution
short of meeting in court. There is a direct relationship between the time involved in
settling a dispute and the cost involved. Quicker resolution is generally cheaper.
</p>
<p>The information required to reach a settlement may dictate the mechanism pre-
ferred. The closer the parties come to having the courts settle their dispute, the more
formal the information requirements. Strict rules of evidence in the courtroom may
not be desirable to parties because of publicity. Companies involved in the dispute
may not be willing to spread out their dirty linen or trade secrets in public. In addi-
tion, the credibility of experts and other witnesses may be more difficult to achieve
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t have the right additives,&rdquo; says Dennis Zogbi, publisher of Passive Component Indus-
try magazine (Cary, North Carolina), which broke the story in the fall of 2004. According to
Zogbi&rsquo;s sources, the capacitors made from the formula become unstable when charged, gener-
ating hydrogen gas, bursting, and letting the electrolyte leak onto the circuit board. Zogbi
cites tests by Japanese manufacturers that indicate the capacitor&rsquo;s lifetimes are half or less
of the 4,000 hours of continuous ripple current they are rated for.
</p>
<p>Electronics makers are ordinarily very careful about capacitor quality. &ldquo;The large volumes of
passive content in any electronic device means that you have that many more chances for a
product to fail,&rdquo; says Zogbi, who also runs The Paumanok Group (Cary, North Carolina), a mar-
ket analysis firm focused on the passive components industry. Electronics firms generally sup-
ply their manufacturers with a list of parts and materials they can use from suppliers whose
quality they trust. Zogbi suspects that, in an effort to cut costs, contract manufacturers used
dodgy component sources that were not on the approved list. This action was in default of
their contractual terms. Major Taiwanese capacitor makers have vigorously denied having
made any bad components, but the crisis had a chilling effect on the island&rsquo;s whole indus-
try, which produces 30% of the world&rsquo;s aluminum electrolytic capacitors.
</p>
<p>Taiwanese suppliers says that Japanese customers who stopped buying from their company
even showed the firm internal documents written in Japanese that state that any relationship
with Lien Yan would lead to boycotts on the part of the Japanese firm&rsquo;s customers.
</p>
<p>While Taiwanese passives makers are trying to shore up relations with their customers, some
of the computer firms affected are doing the same.
</p>
<p>Carey Holzman, as a builder of custom PCs, has been trying to raise awareness about the de-
fects. He thinks manufacturers should be more public about the problem and issue a recall.
&ldquo;Main board replacement is a big job. It&rsquo;s a huge amount of downtime for the user,&rdquo; he
says. Failures can also occur after the warranty has expired, he points out. &ldquo;The manu-
facturers should do the right thing.&rdquo;

<p>The Top Ten Most Fre-
quently Negotiated Terms
Reveal Continued Focus
on Failure
</p>
<p>Each year, the International Association of Commercial and Contract Managers (IACCM)
collects data from more than 500 international companies and organizations, representing
several thousand contract negotiators. Their CEO, Tim Cummins, asks members which terms
and conditions they negotiate most frequently. The data tells us where time is spent; it re-
flects changing issues and concerns; and it also reveals much about the ways companies be-
have and the value they place on their trading relationships. After completing the most
recent survey for 2006, Mr. Cummins communicated his disappointment with the results in
his weekly blog, which follows:
</p>
<p>Once again, the results for 2006 indicate many opportunities for rethinking
the role of contracting in shaping relationships, supporting brand image and
as tools for sophisticated risk management&mdash;as opposed to blunt instru-
ments for risk allocation. This report highlights the results and suggests new
approaches that could result in significant business benefits.
</p>
<p>Leading consultants and business gurus have emphasized the growing impor-
tance of the &ldquo;quality of interactions&rdquo; in determining a company&rsquo;s market image
and reputation. Over the last year, there have been signs that corporate execu-
tives understand the direct link between commitment management and busi-
ness success, how a company negotiates, the commitment terms it offers, and
market perceptions of how easy (and &ldquo;fair&rdquo;) they are to do business with.
</p>
<p>For all the talk about a changing environment, this year&rsquo;s Top Ten Frequently
Negotiated Terms shows no sign that it has affected the behavior or attitudes
of those charged with responsibility for setting policy or leading negotiations.
True, most corporations continue to issue very mixed messages. They declare
a strategic intent to differentiate, to partner, to add value. But at the same
time, they send internal messages about control, cost reduction, standardiza-
tion, and risk avoidance. They highlight the need to be flexible, adaptive, and
agile, yet they introduce software tools and measurement systems that en-
force compliance and inhibit change. And in their trading relationships, they
offer the promise of a match made in heaven&mdash;until they introduce the pre-
nuptial agreement and its administrators.
</p>
<p>And so we end another year with value-reduction terms heading the list: limita-
tions of liability, levels of indemnity, control of intellectual property, rights to
terminate, liquidated damages for performance failure. . . . These are often
called &ldquo;value reduction&rdquo; terms because they contribute little or nothing to the
quality of the relationship, nor the likelihood of its success. They distract from
value-add relationships or eliminate the possibility for discussions that can
lead to more productive relationships. And they tackle risk in only a very
narrow sense&mdash;most of these terms are about allocating the consequences of

<p>failure. By undermining the framework for collaboration, they often increase
the probability that failure will occur.
</p>
<p>To suggest that today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Frequently Negotiated Terms&rdquo; represent good gover-
nance is misleading. At present, there are few signs of change. Companies
continue to invest in resources and software systems that focus on control
and compliance. Internal measurements are either insufficient or lacking when
it comes to the quality or outputs of the contracting process; they do not en-
courage or prompt change or improvement. They do not require the custodians
of terms and conditions to become more innovative or creative in their think-
ing, or to focus on wider issues of company performance and risk.
</p>
<p>What changes might we have hoped for? How would the list change if we
were indeed moving towards a more collaborative framework for business
relationships?
</p>
<p>With the right focus, measurements, and incentives, I believe that the discus-
sion would switch to ensuring the methods and mechanisms for building
and measuring success. Certainly this would involve topics like Service Le-
vels (relatively static at #11) because these set agreed parameters for perfor-
mance. But it should also focus attention on governance topics such as
Change Management (not in the Top 30), Business Continuity (down from
#19 to #22) and Project/Relationship Reviews (also not in the Top 30). The
only clause that is arguably part of the &ldquo;good governance&rdquo; portfolio to have
made significant progress (from #35 last year to #17 this year) is Dispute
Resolution.
</p>
<p>I would also expect that those charged with better governance (or those seeking
a route to higher value and status within the organization) might spare a few
minutes to question their traditional adherence to the methods by which con-
tracts and disputes are managed. For example, as international trade mush-
rooms, we all know that the legal system is ill equipped to manage trading
relationships. Arguments over governing law and jurisdiction are common. Re-
cent U.S. research has shown that even in a sophisticated and well-developed
market like the United States, the courts are weighted against foreign litigants.
So why would any right-thinking businessperson want to lose the advantage of
home turf? To reduce the contentious debate, one may move to alternative dis-
pute resolution mechanisms such as arbitration or mediation&mdash;and institute dif-
ferent (nonjudicial) forms of incentives for proper performance and sanctions for
specific failures.
</p>
<p>Another example where we waste so much time is in the area of liquidated dam-
ages. Recent IACCM research illustrated the frequency with which we negotiate
such terms&mdash;and then either have no mechanism to monitor performance or
consistently elect not to enforce the term because &ldquo;it would damage our
relationship.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Superior companies that truly focus on customer value will also peruse the
list and identify ways that terms and conditions might offer differentiation. Per-
formance Undertakings, Security, Most Favored Customer clauses, Disaster Re-
covery, and Benchmarking are among the examples where creative thinking
and innovative approaches can add value through reducing customer risk and
increasing relationship loyalty. S

<p>CONCLUSION
This chapter provides an overview of the types of contracts used by purchasers, ad-
</p>
<p>ministration procedures applied, and methods of resolving contractual disputes.
</p>
<p>Although it is impossible to cover all potential situations where a specific contract
should be applied, the rules of thumb developed here should provide a reasonable set
of guidelines. As a final point, it is interesting to note that many organizations are
eliminating contracts altogether and are choosing to do business with suppliers on an
informal basis. This type of arrangement requires the development of excellent sup-
plier relationships and trust between the parties. It is highly unlikely, however, that
contracts between buyers and sellers will ever disappear.

<p>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. Where do you believe buyers spend most of their time in negotiations: on the up-
front clauses or on the attached schedules?
</p>
<p>2. What are some examples of price indices that might be used to track commodity
prices such as steel or copper, and how should they be included in the schedule
to minimize risk to both parties?
</p>
<p>3. What are the risks to buyers associated with each of the different types of con-
tracts (fixed-price, incentive, and cost-based contracts)?
</p>
<p>4. What are the risks to suppliers associated with each of the different types of con-
tracts (fixed-price, incentive, and cost-based contracts)?
</p>
<p>5. Which types of firms are most suited to using turnkey systems contracts for their
information system development?
</p>
<p>6. Suppose you are a purchase manager who is the contract administrator for a ma-
jor consulting firm installing a major enterprise resource planning system such as
SAP or Oracle. What are some of the key elements that you would wish to in-
clude in the contract with the consulting company implementing this system?
</p>
<p>7. Why do consultants typically want to avoid including detailed outcomes in their
contracts? Is this ethical?
</p>
<p>8. Under what conditions are short-term contracts preferable to long-term
contracts?
</p>
<p>9. Certain industries, such as the computer industry, are faced with constantly chang-
ing technologies, short product life cycles, many small-component suppliers, and
demanding customers. Under these conditions, what type of contract would you
recommend for a critical component supplier? What other measures would you in-
clude in this contract?

<p>Iraqi Food Probe Uncovers Trail of Potential
Ethical Conflicts
</p>
<p>A probe of the supply chain that provides food to U.S. forces in Iraq is the subject of a
continuing investigation into alleged wrongdoings by several members of the supply chain
and was the reason for the apparent suicide of an Army officer. This officer was responsible
for operations in Camp Arifjan, a large logistics and food staging facility in Kuwait. The ongo-
ing investigation reveals potential ethical issues in the complex web of transactions that ulti-
mately provides daily meals to U.S. troops located in Iraq and Kuwait.
</p>
<p>The entire investigation started when U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Marshall Gutierrez &ldquo;blew
the whistle&rdquo; on a Kuwaiti firm, Public Warehousing Company. Lieutenant Colonel Gutierrez felt
he had discovered rampant overcharging by the firm. Two examples of this overcharging were
(1) $95 for five-gallon bags of Coca-Cola syrup, which were selling for around $40 from
Kuwait City merchants, and (2) $8 a pound for green beans. Public Warehousing, in its de-
fense, claims that it was charging a total price that must consider not only the cost of the food
it supplies but other costs including those associated with storing, handling, and delivering it to
multiple locations. It also cited that more than 30 of its employees have been killed on the job.
Regarding the green beans, it claims the military required a hard-to-find style of green beans.
</p>
<p>Public Warehousing is one of the world&rsquo;s largest transport companies and is designated as
the &ldquo;prime vendor&rdquo; for virtually all food served to some 150,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and Ku-
wait. However, Lieutenant Colonel Gutierrez&rsquo;s allegations spawned a larger inquiry into the
practices of the entire supply chain extending back through Public Warehousing&rsquo;s suppliers.
The following illustration highlights the flow of the food supply chain.

</p>
<p>Potential conflicts have been cited at various points in the chain. American Grocers is the pri-
mary supplier to Sultan Center, which in turn supplies more than $200 million of food items
annually to Public Warehousing. Members of the powerful Sultan merchant family of Kuwait
are large stockholders in both Sultan Center and Public Warehousing. Sultan Center owns
31% of the firm National Real Estate Company WLL, which owns 24% of Public Ware-
housing. Evidence has indicated that Sultan Center, after receiving payment for goods it sup-
plied, returned 10% of the amount to Public Warehousing. If the two firms were related and
not negotiating at &ldquo;arm&rsquo;s length,&rdquo; then the discounts should have been passed directly to
the U.S. government. Government contracts pay a supplier costs plus a certain profit margin.
It is generally not legal to pass goods among a series of related entities to inflate the price
of those goods. Records show that Sultan Center acted as a middleman, supplying Public
Warehousing with American food products such as peanut butter, pepperoni, calzones, and S

<p>potato wedges from American Grocers. It is unclear why American Grocers couldn&rsquo;t ship these
directly to Public Warehousing.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile American Grocers, which is run by a Lebanese immigrant (Samir Itani), has been
charged with 46 criminal counts of conspiring to defraud the United States and making false
claims with at least $1.9 million of allegedly bogus invoices. Charges claim that American Gro-
cers inflated its bills for food by putting costs on its invoices that were never incurred, such
as trucking charges. These charges were then passed along to Public Warehousing, which
then passed them on to the U.S. government. Mr. Itani of American Grocers has pleaded not
guilty and his lawyer claims he did not engage in any intentional wrongdoing.
</p>
<p>The investigation is also extending back to U.S. food producers. Records indicate that Sara
Lee Corporation paid 5% of the purchase price back to Public Warehousing for meat and bak-
ery products. The agreement was negotiated by a Sara Lee executive in charge of military
sales, who had previously served as a chief warrant officer in the Army. In an April 2007 let-
ter to the Pentagon, a lawyer for Tyson Foods complained that &ldquo;elements within the military&rdquo;
were providing sole-source contracts &ldquo;to certain companies employing former military person-
nel.&rdquo; Further, Tyson&rsquo;s attorney stated that &ldquo;it appears the process for specifying brand-
named merchandise may have been inappropriate.&rdquo; Since 2003 the Army Center for Excel-
lence Subsistence has issued guidelines directing that chicken breast, turkey breast, ham,
and sausage consumed by U.S. forces in Iraq and Kuwait be supplied by Sara Lee.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the events leading to the death of whistleblower Lieutenant Colonel Gutierrez in
Kuwait took another twist. He was accused of asking for a cash payment from a Public Ware-
housing sales executive. He also solicited help from Tamimi Global, Public Warehousing&rsquo;s
chief competitor, in assisting with the overpricing investigation. Then in May of 2006, Lieuten-
ant Colonel Gutierrez requested that an order for some $21 million of vegetables, dairy, and
baked goods be placed with Tamimi Global. His contact at Tamimi Global was Shabbir Khan,
who was already under investigation for fraud and bribery at the U.S. base in Kuwait. Ta-
mimi Global allegedly had a &ldquo;party house&rdquo; on the Arifjan base, regularly visited by con-
tractors and contracting officers. According to a sworn statement in July 2006, a former Army
officer admitted taking $8,000 in gifts and bribes from a Tamimi executive and $50,000
from another catering firm. He further admitted to seeing at least five other Army officers tak-
ing bribes during a dozen parties at the Tamimi house.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Gutierrez was then charged with bribery and mishandling of secret informa-
tion and accepting illegal gifts. Records show that he also had married an 18-year-old Kuwaiti
woman, while his wife of 22 years was in the States attending to a sick relative. After five
days of detention, Colonel Gutierrez was released and transferred to another camp to await
court-martial proceedings. On September 4, 2007, his body was found in camp quarters, and
no note was found. Two autopsies concluded that he had died of poisoning from ethylene gly-
col, an active ingredient in anti-freeze. The Army ruled his death a suicide. Following his origi-
nal arrest in late August, Army investigators searched Lieutenant Colonel Gutierrez&rsquo;s home; they
found $27,000 in U.S. and Kuwaiti currency, a two-week-old Kuwaiti marriage certificate, alco-
hol, and a magazine it termed pornography. Both of the latter two items are illegal in Kuwait.
</p>
<p>Many issues remain in the ongoing investigation into the Army&rsquo;s food procurement system. Of
prime importance is, how pervasive are fraud and corruption in the food procurement supply
chain? The amount in dispute in the Public Warehouse investigation is at least $100 million.
Additionally, many questions remain about Lieutenant Colonel Gutierrez. How did he meet his
second wife and why did they decide to marry? What was the nature of Lieutenant Colonel Gu-
tierrez&rsquo;s relationship with the Tamimi executive later convicted of bribery? In his defense,

<p>540 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>As illustrated in the Army&rsquo;s food investigation, today&rsquo;s global business environment
has made it more important than ever for purchasing managers to understand the
changing nature of law at the international, federal, state, and regional levels. Purchas-
ing&rsquo;s daily activities are essentially concerned with the laws regarding contracts and
the laws regarding agency. The majority of purchasing law is derived primarily from
the laws regarding contracts.
</p>
<p>Contract law essentially determines the nature of agreements that are enforceable
and create legal rights between the parties. The characteristics of offer and accep-
tance, satisfaction, and nonperformance have all been clearly established by the law.
Contracts between two or more parties allow the shifting of risk between the entities
and constitute the foundation and fabric for every type of supply chain relationship.
</p>
<p>Agency law, on the other hand, deals with the role of managers as individual
representatives acting on behalf of their organization. It is important that purchasing
managers understand the role they play as agents of their organization, so that they
do not exceed the responsibilities bestowed upon them in this role. As agents of their
organization, purchasing managers also wield a great deal of power in allocating the
business of the company to their suppliers. They must also be aware of the potential
for ethical abuses of this power that may be encountered.
</p>
<p>Although we cannot provide a comprehensive treatment of these issues here, this
chapter will introduce some of the basic legal concerns that purchasing managers
must be aware of in their profession. Specifically, we begin with a discussion of the
roles and responsibilities of purchasing managers as individuals representing their or-
ganization and then discuss the major features of the Uniform Commercial Code
(UCC). The major features of contract law are reviewed as well as the important area
of patents and intellectual property. Antitrust laws that affect purchasing are dis-
cussed next, followed by an overview of purchasing ethics and social responsibility.
</p>
<p>Legal Authority and Personal Liability of the
Purchasing Manager
</p>
<p>Laws of Agency
The laws regarding agency are concerned with governing the relationship of princi-
</p>
<p>pals and agents. An agent is a person or entity who has been authorized to act on be-
half of some other person or entity. A principal, on the other hand, is the
corresponding person or entity for whom agents carry out their authority. The pur-
chasing manager/buyer is typically considered to be a general agent for the buying
firm (the principal). That means that a supplier dealing with this manager/buyer has

<p>a right to rely on the individual&rsquo;s statements, both in written form and verbally. Con-
versely, the sales representative can also be considered to be an agent of the selling
firm (also a principal). In most cases, the sales representative is a special agent who
can only solicit orders but not change prices, terms, or conditions. Meanwhile, the
purchasing agent is a general agent with broad authority to change prices, terms, and
conditions.
</p>
<p>Legal Authority
Purchasing managers generally have final authority over purchasing decisions
</p>
<p>within their firms. However, this final decision may be reached through the input pro-
vided by a cross-functional sourcing team. In the end, however, someone has to sign
the contract, so the purchasing manager is most often considered as the general
agent. (A general agent role merely implies that the guidelines provided by the em-
ployer for this individual are quite broad and general in nature.) Because purchasing
managers are responsible for a significant amount of expenditures, the employer&rsquo;s in-
structions to its purchasing managers should be expressed clearly and succinctly. The
purchasing agency relationship is created between the employer and employee when
the company hires an individual to perform the purchasing job. Typically, a job de-
scription provides the basis for an agreement between the employing firm and pur-
chasing agent/manager regarding actual scope of authority.
</p>
<p>Purchasing managers have the right to require clear and unequivocal instructions
from their employers regarding the scope of their day-to-day job performance ex-
pectations. From a legal perspective, purchasing managers have a fiduciary obligation
to act in the best interests of their employer. This means that if they carry out their
duties in a faithful, ethical, and conscientious manner, then their obligations to the
employers are fulfilled. However, in agreeing to perform the purchasing duties for
the employer, purchasing managers do not imply that they will never make mistakes.
</p>
<p>Personal Liability
Certain individuals in many organizations have interpreted the statement &ldquo;acting
</p>
<p>in the best interests of the employer&rdquo; in radically different ways. There are a number
of ways in which purchasing managers can be held personally liable in the conduct
of their day-to-day activities, even if they were supposedly following these guidelines.
Depending on the issue at hand, this personal liability can take the form of either a
civil or criminal suit. The concept of &ldquo;apparent versus actual authority&rdquo; is the deter-
mining factor in such cases.
</p>
<p>Actual authority stems from the instructions and granting of authority to the
purchasing manager via the job description provided by the employer. These docu-
ments typically define the limits and parameters under which the purchasing man-
ager is expected to operate. Apparent authority, on the other hand, is that level of
authority perceived by the seller to be available to the purchasing manager. In most
instances, apparent authority can be defined as the scope of authority possessed by
other purchasing managers with similar positions in other organizations within the
same industry.
</p>
<p>If a purchasing manager, in carrying out normal procurement responsibilities, ex-
ceeds his or her actual but not apparent authority, then the employer is still responsi-
ble for performance of the resulting contract but could seek legal action against the
purchasing manager personally. Exceeding both actual and apparent authority can

<p>have dire consequences; an individual may be held directly liable by the supplier or
other third party (see Exhibit 15.1).
</p>
<p>It is in the purchasing manager&rsquo;s own self-interest to ensure that all suppliers or
other third parties are aware that his or her actions are on behalf of the employing
firm. All contracts should be signed in a manner that demonstrates the agency rela-
tionship. The following language might be used in a contract:1
</p>
<p>[your name] on behalf of [your company] or [your company name] by
[your name]
</p>
<p>Purchasing managers can be held personally liable for their damaging and illegal ac-
tivities if they perform them without the authority of their firm. This personal liabil-
ity may occur even if the purchasing manager believes (incorrectly) that he or she
actually possesses the authority. Any damaging acts performed outside of the man-
ager&rsquo;s scope of authority (whether actual or apparent) can lead to personal liability
even though such acts were intended to benefit the employer. In essence, any act that
causes damage to any other person could cause a legal liability to the purchasing man-
ager who performs such an act.
</p>
<p>Other areas of activity for the purchasing manager that could lead to personal lia-
bility include the following:2
</p>
<p>&bull; Deception for personal gain while acting as an agent for the principal firm
(includes taking bribes)
</p>
<p>&bull; Violating the lawful protection of items owned by others, such as patent
infringement

</p>
<p>These activities are related to another important aspect of purchasing law: ethical
behavior. A good rule of thumb is to remember that purchasers must always act in
the best interests of their employer. This includes maintaining loyalty, respecting con-
fidential information, and avoiding compromising relationships that may lead to a
conflict of interest, which will be discussed later in the Purchasing Ethics section. Un-
derstanding contract law is one way to ensure that purchasers will legally protect
their employer&rsquo;s best interests.
</p>
<p>Contract Law
</p>
<p>Essential Elements of a Contract
Commercial law is defined as that &ldquo;body of [the] law that refers to how business
</p>
<p>firms (parties) enter into contracts with each other, execute contracts, and remedy
problems that arise in the process.&rdquo;3 There are two major topical areas of commercial
law that are of day-to-day interest to the purchasing professional: the laws regarding
agency and the laws regarding contracts. We have already discussed agency law to
some extent earlier in the chapter. Thus, we will turn our attention to the laws regard-
ing contracts.
</p>
<p>In its most basic form, a contract can be defined as an agreement between two or
more parties that can be legally enforced. Note that people make agreements every
day, but not every agreement can be considered a contract. A contract is an agree-
ment between two or more people to do specified things in exchange for other speci-
fied things. For example:
</p>
<p>Shirley wants to go to the store to buy some potato chips but she doesn&rsquo;t
have a car. She says to Rich, &ldquo;I will pay you a dollar to take me to the
store to buy some potato chips.&rdquo; Rich agrees and takes Shirley to the store.
</p>
<p>The above statement can be characterized as a contract. Shirley agreed to do a spec-
ified thing (pay Rich a dollar) in exchange for another specified thing (take Shirley to
the store). In legal thinking a contract has three essential elements:
</p>
<p>&bull; Offer
</p>
<p>&bull; Acceptance
</p>
<p>&bull; Consideration
</p>
<p>If any one of these elements is lacking, then an enforceable contract does not ex-
ist. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at these three elements.
</p>
<p>Offer
An offer is a proposal or expression by one person that he or she is willing to do
</p>
<p>something for certain terms. For example:

<p>544 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Betsy goes into Mimi&rsquo;s Wholesale Video Store and says to Mimi, &ldquo;I want
to buy 1,000 DVDs of the Harry Potter movie from you. I will pay you $15
for each DVD.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Betsy has made a specific offer&mdash;to purchase a specific movie&mdash;in specific volumes
(1,000)&mdash;at a specific price ($15,000). This constitutes a valid offer. Somewhat differ-
ent is a conditional offer, which includes additional criteria for completion of the
agreement.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<p>Betsy goes into Mimi&rsquo;s Wholesale Video Store and says to Mimi, &ldquo;I want
to buy 1,000 DVDs of the Harry Potter movie from you. I will pay you $15
for each DVD IF you deliver them to my place of business on February 1,
2008.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In this case, a deadline has been added to the offer. The offer is valid if the condi-
tions are met.
</p>
<p>Acceptance
The second important part of the contract is the acceptance. Legally, a contract
</p>
<p>does not exist until the offer is formally accepted, either verbally or in written form.
The offer and acceptance should generally match. However, this is not always the
case. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (discussed later in the chapter), the offer
and acceptance need not always match. An acceptance can have additional terms,
which will become part of the contract unless the offeror objects within a reasonable
amount of time.
</p>
<p>Assuming the offer and acceptance match, there is an agreement leading up to a
contract. If they don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s more like a negotiation: an offer, to which someone re-
sponds with a counteroffer rather than an acceptance, must be restated. This con-
tinues until both sides reach an agreement, or a so-called meeting of the minds. It is
important to note that a contract exists only when there is an agreement resulting
from both an offer and an acceptance. The agreement doesn&rsquo;t exist until the supplier
accepts the offer, and a meeting of the minds occurs. An acceptance, as recognized
by the Uniform Commercial Code, can be in &ldquo;any manner and by any medium rea-
sonable to the circumstances.&rdquo; In other words, the manner and medium of accep-
tance by the supplier can be met either through the promise of an acceptance or by
the supplier&rsquo;s performance of the terms and conditions of the contract&mdash;that is, the ac-
tual delivery of the requested goods or services without prior verbal advance notice.
</p>
<p>Many customer purchase orders typically contain a written copy that outlines the
procedures for acknowledgment or acceptance by suppliers. However, suppliers fre-
quently accept or acknowledge customer orders on their own form, which may con-
tain language and terms different from the customer&rsquo;s original purchase order. When
this occurs, the supplier&rsquo;s terms will automatically be incorporated into the final con-
tract unless one of the following conditions is present:
</p>
<p>1. The supplier&rsquo;s terms substantially or materially alter the original intent of the
offer (purchase order).
</p>
<p>2. The buyer objects to the supplier&rsquo;s acceptance terms in writing.
</p>
<p>3. The purchase order explicitly states that no alteration of terms is acceptable.

</p>
<p>Chapter 15 Purchasing Law and Ethics 545</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When the terms of the buyer&rsquo;s purchase order and the supplier&rsquo;s acceptance or
acknowledgment conflict, and none of the conditions listed above are present, all of
the terms of both the purchase order and the acceptance become part of the result-
ing contract except the conflicting terms and conditions. In effect, the conflicting
terms and conditions are simply disregarded. The purchasing manager must there-
fore ensure that the terms and conditions of all supplier acceptance forms are care-
fully reviewed.
</p>
<p>If the buyer wants to avoid any dispute over the terms and conditions of the con-
tract, the purchase order should include a statement to the effect that &ldquo;absolutely no
deviation from the terms and conditions contained herein is permitted.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Consideration
The third element of a contract is difficult to define. Consideration, which has
</p>
<p>nothing to do with being considerate or nice to people, is rather a form of &ldquo;mutual ob-
ligation&rdquo;&mdash;with each party bound to perform at certain levels and agreeing to carry
out his or her responsibilities. Consideration is something of value in the formation of
the contract that gives it legal validity. Consideration takes place when the offeree in-
curs a legal detriment in response to the offeror&rsquo;s offer. The offeree indicates a willing-
ness to give up something of value to the offeror or a designated third party or give
up something of value to him- or herself. In the business world, mutual promises in
a contract of sale, whether express or implied, are generally sufficient consideration.
For example, in the previous example, Betsy made an offer that Mimi accepted.
There has also been consideration. Betsy&rsquo;s consideration is express: She promised to
pay $15 per tape. Mimi&rsquo;s consideration is implied: By saying &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; she implied that
she promised to sell Betsy 1,000 tapes for $15 apiece.
</p>
<p>Two other elements are important to consider in contract law: competent parties/
mutual assent and legal subject matter.
</p>
<p>Competent Parties / Mutual Assent
The parties to a legally enforceable contract must have full contractual capacity
</p>
<p>through being either principals or qualified agents as described earlier. In addition,
both the buyer and the seller must not have engaged in any fraudulent activities
when formulating the agreement. The use of force or coercion to reach an agreement
is not acceptable in signing a contract because both parties must enter into the agree-
ment of their own free will. Both parties must indicate a willingness to enter into the
agreement and be bound by its terms.
</p>
<p>Legal Subject Matter
If an agreement has been made regarding a purpose that is illegal, then the result-
</p>
<p>ing contract is null and void. The performance of a party in regard to the contract
must not be an unlawful act if the agreement is to be enforceable. However, if the pri-
mary purpose of a contract is legal, but some terms contained within the agreement
are not, then the contract may or may not itself be illegal depending on the serious-
ness of the illegal terms and the degree to which the legal and illegal terms can be
separated.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The Purchase Order&mdash;Is It a Contract?
In most instances, the contracting parties participate in a series of negotiation de-
</p>
<p>liberations through which the various terms and conditions of the contract are dis-
cussed, outlined, and agreed upon. As shown in Exhibit 15.2, a process takes place
before the purchase order develops. This is initiated by the request for quotation
(RFQ), sent by the buyer to the supplier. The RFQ contains the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Standard terms and conditions of the transaction
</p>
<p>&bull; Quantity/conditions of delivery
</p>
<p>&bull; Description, specifications, and end use of the item
</p>
<p>&bull; If customized, reviewed by legal counsel before the RFQ is submitted
</p>
<p>&bull; If a competitive bid, description of the manner and time period in which
the bids will be evaluated
</p>
<p>&bull; Services
</p>
<p>The RFQ is not an offer but a request for price and availability. The supplier will
generally respond to the RFQ with a quote (an offer to sell), which may then initiate
further discussion and negotiation between the purchasing commodity team and the
supplier&rsquo;s team. Eventually, this leads to a contract, which documents all of the differ-
ent offers and counteroffers. Most commercial contracts are comprised of similar sets
of general terms and conditions. With the exception of a description of the parties in-
volved, a description of the basic subject of the contract and statement of work includ-
ing dates, and a clearly definable or determinable quantity, the UCC can be relied
upon to supply all other terms.
</p>
<p>A purchase order can be an offer, acceptance, or counteroffer, depending on the
circumstances. It is an offer if it is sent without a quote or other conversation with
the seller concerning terms of the order. It would be a counteroffer if it is sent in re-
sponse to a quote but changes one or more of the terms of the quote (e.g., delivery

<p>quantity or packaging). It would be an acceptance if it mirrors the seller&rsquo;s quote.
Once accepted, a purchase order becomes a contract. The major parts of a purchase
order include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Fixed prices and quantities (including taxes)
</p>
<p>&bull; Buyer&rsquo;s right of inspection and rejection
</p>
<p>&bull; Right to make specification/design changes
</p>
<p>&bull; Holding buyer harmless, patent infringement
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier&rsquo;s right to assign contract to a third party
</p>
<p>&bull; Instructions regarding risk of loss
</p>
<p>&bull; Statement of credit and payment terms
</p>
<p>&bull; Identification
</p>
<p>&bull; Packing and preparation
</p>
<p>&bull; Statements of warranty
</p>
<p>&bull; Shipment quantities/dates
</p>
<p>&bull; Assignment of seller&rsquo;s rights
</p>
<p>&bull; Arbitration clause
</p>
<p>&bull; Right to cancel unshipped portion
</p>
<p>Price
Of the terms listed above, the price term is perhaps the single most important ele-
</p>
<p>ment of the entire contract. Section 2-305 of the UCC, entitled &ldquo;Open Price Term,&rdquo; in-
dicates explicitly that the parties do not necessarily need to reach agreement on a
price in order to have an enforceable contract. Although the UCC allows for open
price terms, quantity must be specified so that there is a reasonably certain basis for de-
termining damages in the event of a breach of contract. Although the &ldquo;open price
term&rdquo; clause promotes flexibility in setting prices, the possibility of being charged an
unacceptable price increases. If the contract indicates that the price is to be deter-
mined at some point in the future or by some other mechanism, two basic require-
ments must be satisfied per Section 2-305 of the UCC. First, both parties must intend
to make a binding contract even though the price remains open. Second, there must
be some reasonably certain basis for giving relief (or determining value). A purchasing
manager who is in doubt as to whether an enforceable contract might have been
reached without agreeing upon a price should indicate in correspondence with the sup-
plier that no contract or agreement exists unless there is agreement on a specific price.
</p>
<p>Boilerplate Contract Terms and Conditions
In addition to the negotiated terms of price determination, description of the
</p>
<p>goods, delivery, and quantity, a number of other standard terms and conditions (of-
ten referred to as &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo;) are typically included in most commercial contracts
and purchase order agreements. Usually preprinted on the back of forms used by the
purchaser (and the seller), these terms and conditions are intended to provide a mea-
sure of protection for the purchaser against undesirable actions by a supplier and re-
quire the supplier to conform to certain business practices and procedures.
</p>
<p>Because boilerplate language and the wording of other preprinted purchase order
and sales documents may often conflict, it is important to communicate clearly with
suppliers exactly which terms are in effect. (If in doubt, don&rsquo;t sign it and assume that

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>things can be worked out later!) Many purchase orders are placed over the tele-
phone, in person, and increasingly, through the Internet; purchasing managers must
thus be aware of the potential pitfalls of oral contracts. It is important to remember
that a contract is a relationship&mdash;not a physical entity&mdash;between the parties involved.
</p>
<p>When the contract is reduced to writing, the written document is not the actual
contract but simply hard evidence of the existence of the underlying contractual rela-
tionship. Also, whenever a contract is reduced to writing, the written document super-
sedes all previous oral evidence. It is therefore important to ensure that all relevant
negotiated data and warranty-related oral statements deemed to be part of the agree-
ment are also reduced to writing in the contract. The UCC under Section 2-201 spec-
ifies the following:4
</p>
<p>&bull; In order for a contract to exist, there must normally be some written (and
signed) notation if the value of the order for the sale of goods is $500 or
more. (The most recent revision of the UCC increases the triggering point
for the UCC Statute of Frauds to $5,000, but currently no U.S. state has
adopted revised Section 201.) Exceptions where a verbal contract would be
valid on orders over $500 are when the following conditions are met:
</p>
<p>&bull; The goods are made specifically for the buyer.
</p>
<p>&bull; There is proof to show the parties behaved as if a contract existed.
</p>
<p>&bull; The parties have always done business on a verbal basis.
</p>
<p>&bull; If the supplier provides a written confirmation memorandum that is not in
accordance with the purchaser&rsquo;s understanding of an oral order, the pur-
chaser must give a notice of objection to the supplier within 10 days of re-
ceipt of the memorandum.
</p>
<p>A good example of this situation is when you are shopping for a used vehicle. The
salesperson may exaggerate the virtues of a particular car while walking around
the lot, yet when you sit down to review the contract, you may find that many of the
&ldquo;promises&rdquo; are no longer in writing. In order to determine the true conditions of the
sale, you should write down exactly what you have been told, and ask for the sales-
person&rsquo;s written signature underneath your notes while still out on the lot.
</p>
<p>Cancellation of Orders and Breach of Contract
A good contract will protect the interests and rights of both buyer and seller. As a
</p>
<p>result, contractual obligations are equally binding upon both parties to the agreement.
</p>
<p>People cannot go around arbitrarily canceling or defaulting on their contracts. In
some instances, however, one of the parties to a contractual arrangement may seek to
cancel the agreement after it has been made. In other cases, the supplier may simply
fail to perform in the manner agreed to in the contract. Under these conditions, the
buyer will always go back to the original contract to determine what the potential rem-
edies are to these situations. If they are not spelled out in detail, the UCC once again
provides some help.
</p>
<p>Cancellation of Orders
Contract cancellations can generally be classified into three categories: (1) cancella-
</p>
<p>tion for default, (2) cancellation for convenience of the purchaser (&ldquo;anticipatory
breach&rdquo;), or (3) cancellation by mutual consent.

</p>
<p>Chapter 15 Purchasing Law and Ethics 549</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Cancellation for default can be defined as failure of one of the parties to live up to
the terms and conditions of the contract. Supplier actions that can result in this type
of breach of contract include late deliveries, failing to meet product specifications, or
otherwise failing to perform in accordance with contract provisions. The types of dam-
ages that might be awarded include production cost penalties, additional overtime, or
expedited transportation costs. In actual practice, more effective settlements can be
reached through negotiation with the supplier rather than through the litigation
process.
</p>
<p>Cancellation for the convenience of the purchaser, or anticipatory breach, makes
the purchaser liable for any resulting injury to the supplier. A general rule here is
that the supplier should not be called upon to incur any loss due to the purchaser&rsquo;s
default.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, purchasers should stay away from this term altogether in their
purchase contracts. The term is highly interpretable in court and can result in any
number of negative actions.
</p>
<p>Cancellation by mutual consent indicates that cancellation of a previously agreed-
upon contract does not automatically lead to legal action. If both parties mutually
agree to terminate the agreement, then they have, in effect, created another contract
with the intent of nullifying the first agreement. If there is no potential loss, the sup-
plier will often accept a purchaser&rsquo;s cancellation in good faith as a normal risk of do-
ing business. Even when suppliers have purchased special components or materials
in anticipation of fulfilling their responsibilities under the agreement, the parties can
usually reach a mutually agreeable resolution through the process of negotiation
rather than through litigation.
</p>
<p>Breach of Contract
Under a commercial contract, the supplier is obligated to deliver the goods accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the contract&rsquo;s terms and conditions, and the purchaser is likewise obligated to
accept and tender payment for the goods according to the terms of the agreement. A
breach of contract occurs when either party fails to perform the obligations due under
the contract (without a valid or legal justification). A breach may entitle the offended
party to certain remedies or damages (discussed in greater detail in the next section).
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<p>Mimi&rsquo;s Wholesale Video Store and Betsy now have a valid contract. Betsy
has promised to buy 1,000 DVDs for $15 apiece, and Mimi has promised
to deliver them to Betsy&rsquo;s place of business on February 1. However, Mimi
never shows up with the delivery.
</p>
<p>Mimi may indeed be liable for breach of contract. However, one of the basic rules
of the UCC is that each party to a contract must give the other party the total time
agreed upon to complete his or her obligations under the contract.
</p>
<p>Buyers should avoid the practice of routinely tolerating suppliers that breach pur-
chase contracts. Doing so may result in the buyer forfeiting the right to legal action.
If you, as the purchaser, have systematically accepted late deliveries from a supplier
in the past and continue to accept late deliveries even though you must expedite late
shipments, then you may have waived your right to pursue legal action for damages
caused by the late shipments. For example:

<p>550 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A buyer and a supplier have been doing business for several years. During
the past year, approximately one third of the shipments from the supplier
arrived a week or so late, but the buyer accepted them without serious com-
plaints. In the eyes of the law, these acceptances by the buyer may well
have set a precedent that waives the buyer&rsquo;s rights to timely delivery on fu-
ture contracts.
</p>
<p>To regain his or her legal rights, the buyer must give explicit written notice to the
supplier and provide the supplier a reasonable period of time to gear up to meet the
new delivery requirements. The new contract should also include the minimal lead
time required for design changes, and so on.
</p>
<p>In major contracts, it is often apparent that a breach of contract may create major
headaches for either the buyer or supplier; the level of damages in such cases is diffi-
cult to determine. To avoid this confusion, many organizations include an up-front
termination or liquidated damages provision in the contract at the time of
negotiation.
</p>
<p>This type of provision stipulates the mechanism to be used in determining any
costs and damages to the injured party in the event of a breach of contract. Once
again, spelling it out in the contract helps avoid confusion later on.
</p>
<p>Damages
The concept of damages in the UCC is based on the remedy of a party being
</p>
<p>&ldquo;made whole.&rdquo; In other words, a purchaser who is damaged by a breach of contract
must receive damages that bring the purchaser back to the position where he or she
would have been if the breach had not occurred. Damages include either actual dam-
ages (which include losses that are real or known, or can be reasonably estimated), as
well as punitive damages (extra money over and above as &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; for the de-
fendant&rsquo;s bad behavior). The UCC is quite clear on the point that punitive damages
are not allowed, even if such a provision is contained in the contract. There are essen-
tially three types of damages available to the purchaser:
</p>
<p>&bull; Restitution. Money the plaintiff actually paid to the defendant in connection
with the contract.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reliance. Money the plaintiff lost because he or she was relying on the con-
tract, depending on the defendant to live up to his or her obligations under
the contract.
</p>
<p>&bull; Expectancy. Money the plaintiff was hoping to gain from the contract.
</p>
<p>Back at Mimi&rsquo;s Wholesale Video Store, Mimi and Betsy had a valid contract.
Betsy promised to buy 1,000 DVDs for $15 apiece, and Mimi promised to deliver
them to Betsy&rsquo;s place of business. Betsy gave Mimi $2,000 as a down payment on the
delivery. Betsy also spent $5,000 building new shelves in her retail video store to dis-
play and store the DVDs. Finally, Betsy expected to make a profit of $20,000 after ex-
penses from selling or renting the DVDs to her customers. However, Mimi never
delivers the DVDs, and Betsy sues for breach of contract. What damages is she enti-
tled to?
</p>
<p>Betsy can sue for $2,000 in restitution damages for loss of the down payment,
$5,000 in reliance damages for the shelves, and $20,000 in expectancy damages for
the $20,000 in profits she expected to make (for a total of $27,000).

<p>Chapter 15 Purchasing Law and Ethics 551</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It should be noted by the reader that in order for a firm to recover lost profits, the
firm must produce credible evidence that it would have made such profits. In the
above example, in real life it would indeed be rare for a party to recover $27,000 in a
contract where the other damages are $7000. Why? Because the plaintiff in such a
case could be asked, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go out on the market and cover?&rdquo; meaning
that the plaintiff would have an obligation to purchase alternative supplies and con-
tinue operations. The plaintiff cannot just lie back in the event of breach and reap
profits without effort.
</p>
<p>There are various methods of calculating damages. General damages are equal to
the difference between the value of the purchased goods at the time of delivery and
the goods&rsquo; value at the time of specified delivery. Incidental damages include ex-
penses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation, and the care and cus-
tody of goods appropriately rejected by the purchaser.
</p>
<p>Consequential damages are those expenses incurred by the purchaser because
the goods were not delivered when expected or as specified. Liquidated damages
are those that result if the terms of the contract are not fulfilled and, as discussed
above under remedies, are typically defined prior to the breach under the terms of
the contract.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that even though the UCC calls for full compensation for a
party that is a victim of breach of contract, attorney fees are not recoverable. Also,
speculative damages and lost time of executives are not generally recoverable. The bot-
tom line is that a breach of contract lawsuit will rarely make the nonbreaching party
completely whole again.
</p>
<p>Acceptance and Rejection of Goods
The UCC allows the purchaser to accept part of the shipment and reject the re-
</p>
<p>mainder for cause, or to accept or reject the entire shipment. After the point of accep-
tance, the supplier&rsquo;s rights increase and the purchaser&rsquo;s rights decrease. Once the
purchaser accepts the goods, there is only one recourse&mdash;to make a claim against the
supplier.
</p>
<p>The UCC specifies that the purchaser does not have the legal right to withhold pay-
ment from the supplier once acceptance has been made. The purchaser also does not
have the right at this point to send the goods back unless the supplier consents to
this action.
</p>
<p>The legal concept of acceptance is closely related to the concept of inspection. Pur-
chasers have a legitimate right to inspect contracted goods before accepting or reject-
ing them. The law is quite explicit when it states that the purchaser accept the goods
within a reasonable time whether or not the goods are physically inspected.
</p>
<p>Obvious defects must be discovered and rejected within this reasonable time
frame, or the purchaser has no recourse against the seller. &ldquo;Latent&rdquo; defects are those
that could not have been easily discovered during an inspection and do not fall un-
der this rule. In certain limited situations, the purchaser is able to revoke an accep-
tance of delivered goods. A purchaser may revoke a prior acceptance if a problem is
discovered that substantially impairs the value of the goods. Also, a purchaser can re-
voke a prior acceptance when a prior inspection could not take place for reasons not
related to negligence on the part of the purchaser.

<p>552 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When the goods delivered by the supplier are actually rejected by the purchaser
due to nonconformance, the purchaser must provide notice to the supplier within a
reasonable period of time. The purchaser should be specific in notifying the supplier
that he or she is in breach of contract. General statements about the problems at
hand without stating that the supplier is considered in breach of contract are not ade-
quate notification. The exact terms &ldquo;breach of contract&rdquo; must be used, or the pur-
chaser stands to lose his or her right to recourse from the supplier.
</p>
<p>Once goods are accepted, there are two obligations that the purchaser must meet
in order to recover his or her rights. First, the purchaser must carry the burden of
proof that the goods did not conform to the terms and conditions of the contract. Sec-
ond, the purchaser must, within a reasonable time after the breach is discovered, no-
tify the supplier of that breach or lose the chance for remedy.
</p>
<p>Acceptance of the contracted goods by the purchaser means that ownership of the
goods has been transferred. There are no rituals or formalities required to make the
transfer of ownership. Any words or acts by the purchaser that provide an indication
of the purchaser&rsquo;s intention to transfer ownership are enough to effect the transfer.
</p>
<p>Even though the goods may have been formally rejected by the purchaser, actions
typifying ownership may indicate that acceptance has instead been accomplished. In
order to prevent or mitigate problems arising from the acceptance or rejection of
goods, a number of steps to manage the acceptance process can be implemented by
the purchaser:5
</p>
<p>&bull; The receiving department should stamp all receipts of goods with a state-
ment something to the effect of &ldquo;Received subject to inspection, count, and
testing.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&bull; A thorough set of purchase order terms and conditions should indicate that
all receipts from suppliers are subject to inspection, count, and testing.
</p>
<p>&bull; All delivered goods should be inspected as quickly as possible, and ideally,
immediately upon delivery.
</p>
<p>&bull; If goods are not inspected until they are used, it is a good idea to maintain a
stock rotation system to ensure that older quantities of goods are used first.
</p>
<p>&bull; In some cases, purchasers may want to consider putting language in their
purchase order terms and conditions that defines the reasonable time for in-
spection and acceptance.
</p>
<p>&bull; An internal reporting system should be set up to ensure that defects encoun-
tered in the organization are reported to the purchasing department within
a reasonable time so that remedies can be pursued.
</p>
<p>&bull; Contracts for such items as production equipment should contain a clause
stating that acceptance will not be made until the equipment has been in-
stalled and run satisfactorily for a certain period of time.
</p>
<p>&bull; For hardware- and software-related contracts, the purchaser should carefully
define the acceptance criteria and notify the supplier of the specific process
that this equipment and software will be subjected to.
</p>
<p>Honest Mistakes
Sometimes, in spite of the best efforts of the purchaser and the supplier, honest mis-
</p>
<p>takes occur when parties draw up a purchase agreement. In such instances, careful
consideration of all the circumstances is necessary to determine whether the resulting

<p>Chapter 15 Purchasing Law and Ethics 553</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>contract is valid or invalid. Generally, honest mistakes by a single party to the con-
tract will not void the contract. If the other party was truly unaware of the mistake,
then the contract is still intact. Note that mistakes made by both parties also do not
necessarily affect the validity of the contract.
</p>
<p>Mistakes are not covered under the UCC. The parties must rely on traditional con-
tract law to solve any dispute resulting from a mistake. &ldquo;As a general rule, a party
will not be given relief against a mistake induced by his own negligence. But the rule
is not inflexible and in many cases relief may be granted although the mistake in-
volved some element of negligence, particularly when the other party has been in no
way prejudiced.&rdquo;6 The rules for determining whether or not a contract exists after a
mistake has been made are the basic fairness rules. The judicial system will more
than likely allow a supplier to be absolved from the contract due to a mistake if the
supplier gave the purchaser notification of the mistake before the purchaser relied on
the bid. Buyers should therefore attempt to minimize the occurrence of contractual
mistakes.
</p>
<p>The Uniform Commercial Code
</p>
<p>Purchasing Law before the UCC
In today&rsquo;s society, we take for granted that there is a certain level of fairness and
</p>
<p>predictability in the legal system. This was not always the case. Laws differed from na-
tion to nation, state to state, and city to city. In the United States, every state had,
and still does have, the power to enact is own laws concerning business transactions.
</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1950s, a national editorial board of legal scholars drafted the
body of laws concerning business transactions, which was intended to make business
transactions regular and predictable. The goal was to reduce the number of state-by-
state variations. The resulting code was the federal Uniform Commercial Code. In
1952, all of the states (with the exception of Louisiana) adopted the UCC.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that the UCC does not apply in international contracts. In
such cases, it makes sense to specify the substantive law that applies to the contract
in the contract, enforcing the precaution of &ldquo;buyer beware.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>A number of subsequent revisions to the UCC have kept its provisions more re-
sponsive to changing business conditions. The UCC that is in use today consists of
the following 10 articles:
</p>
<p>1. General introductory provisions
</p>
<p>2. Sales of goods and products
</p>
<p>3. Transactions in commercial paper (bank checks, liability for endorsements)
</p>
<p>4. Bank deposits and collections
</p>
<p>5. Letters of credit (financial instruments issued by banks and other institutions)
</p>
<p>6. Bank transfers
</p>
<p>7. Warehouse receipts, bills of lading, and other documents of title to goods
</p>
<p>8. Transfers in investment securities
</p>
<p>9. Secured transactions
</p>
<p>10. Technical matters

<p>554 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>It is important to understand that the established common law of contracts dis-
cussed in the previous section may often be at odds with actual commercial practices
that were favored by contracting parties for the flexibility and efficiency they offered.
As such, the Uniform Commercial Code is not actually &ldquo;the law&rdquo; of commercial con-
tracts. For the most part, the UCC is a &ldquo;gap-filler&rdquo; and is only pertinent if the parties
themselves do not supply a contract term, or the term is left open. For example, if
nothing is said in a sales contract about delivery, then under the UCC, the goods are
considered delivered to the buyer when they are given to the buyer at the seller&rsquo;s estab-
lishment. In like fashion, under the UCC if nothing different is said in a sales con-
tract, payment is due at the time of delivery of goods. In general, the &ldquo;standard
terms&rdquo; as dictated by the UCC are applicable unless the parties agree to something
else, which they generally do.7
</p>
<p>The primary portion of the Uniform Commercial Code that concerns purchasing
is Article 2, which deals with sales contracts. The UCC provides benefits to the buy-
ing firm in four ways:
</p>
<p>1. If a seller makes an offer in writing, the seller has to live up to it for the pe-
riod of time stated.

<p>2. Verbal agreements, when confirmed in writing and if no objection is made,
are valid.
</p>
<p>3. The conflict between a buyer&rsquo;s purchase order terms and a seller&rsquo;s acknowledg-
ment terms will generally be resolved according to the two firms&rsquo; prior con-
duct. Specifically, a course of dealing (prior conduct) between parties and any
usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged give particu-
lar meaning or qualify terms of an agreement.
</p>
<p>4. As far as warranties are concerned, the purchasing manager can legally rely
on the supplier to provide the item needed to do the job.
</p>
<p>The real effect of Article 2 is to support the buying firm&rsquo;s position in its commer-
cial dealings with its suppliers. The UCC, as opposed to other laws such as the Uni-
form Sales Act, establishes each party&rsquo;s rights and obligations based on the concepts
of fairness and reasonableness, which are founded on accepted business practices.
</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the sale of services is not outlined but is covered un-
der common law (system of jurisprudence). In cases where either the common law
or the UCC may apply, the prevailing condition is the location where the bulk of
funds is expended. One can also agree in a contract to override parts of the UCC&mdash;
so it is important to read the fine print on contracts, being aware of the words &ldquo;un-
less otherwise agreed.&rdquo; Because the UCC does not apply outside the boundaries of
the United States&mdash;international law may have a wide range of agreements related to
business transactions&mdash;the rule of thumb is &ldquo;buyer beware.&rdquo; The most basic elements
of Article 2 within the UCC involve the following four issues:
</p>
<p>&bull; Warranties
</p>
<p>&bull; Transportation terms and risk of loss
</p>
<p>&bull; Seller&rsquo;s rights

<p>Warranties
Warranties ensure that a buyer can legally rely on a supplier to provide the item
</p>
<p>needed to do a job. In its most basic form, a warranty is defined as &ldquo;a promise or
representation made by the seller, which, if necessary, can be legally enforced.&rdquo;8
</p>
<p>There are two major types of warranties: express and implied.

<p>Contract Rights in
a Declining Market
</p>
<p>The decrease in market price of an item was the cause of a dispute involving an elec-
tronic manufacturing service (EMS) that supplied the subassemblies to a major military con-
tractor. The EMS purchased the components from a distributor of electronic components for
a contract it had received on a major satellite project.
</p>
<p>After receiving the subcontract on the satellite project, the EMS sent out bids on a number
of components. The distributor was awarded a contract to supply integrated circuits (ICs)
and other items on an &ldquo;as needed&rdquo; basis. In essence the EMS agreed to buy all of the inte-
grated circuits needed during the contract period from the distributor.
</p>
<p>After nine months the distributor noticed that the quantities of ICs had dropped dramati-
cally. An e-mail was sent to the supply manager indicating that hardly any ICs had been pur-
chased during the past six weeks. The supply manager&rsquo;s e-mail reply was that &ldquo;a competitor
is supplying us ICs to the same specification at less than half of the price you charged us.
If you can meet the price, fine. Otherwise we no longer need ICs from your firm.&rdquo; In her reply
the distributor agreed that a new technology and lower demand had triggered lower market
prices. However, the EMS had agreed to purchase all the ICs at a higher price earlier in the
year. Subsequent meetings failed to produce a satisfactory agreement and the parties
agreed to binding arbitration.
</p>
<p>In its arguments to the arbitrator the EMS contended that the contract merely represented
its agreement to purchase as few or as many ICs as it desired and that the distributor was
obligated to supply the ICs as needed. Because the EMS was well stocked with ICs from the
distributor&rsquo;s competitor it didn&rsquo;t require additional ICs. The distributor argued that the EMS
was committed to buying all ICs from it at the agreed-upon price. Any purchases from an out-
side source violated the spirit and terms of the contract.
</p>
<p>ARBITRATOR&rsquo;S RULING
The arbitrator ruled that a mere price drop was not a reason to circumvent the terms of the
contract. First, the contract was voluntarily made by competent parties. There was no indica-
tion of undue pressure or that one of the parties was made to accept the terms. Thus the con-
tract was not &ldquo;unconscionable.&rdquo; Second, a needs contract should be given its literal
interpretation. In this case the EMS must purchase any ICs it needs from the distributor
named in the contract. Clearly it needed the ICs it purchased from the competitor. It is unfor-
tunate for the buyer that the market price for the ICs dropped. However, if the price had
risen, the distributor would have had to furnish the ICs at the lower price. These are hazards
of the marketplace that are faced by both buyers and sellers. The EMS was directed to pur-
chase the entire quantity of the ICs it had contracted for from the distributor and all future re-
quirements needed over the remainder of the contract period.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Express Warranty
The UCC definition of an express warranty is, &ldquo;Any affirmation of fact or promise
</p>
<p>made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the ba-
sis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affir-
mation or promise.&rdquo; Section 2-313 of the UCC indicates that use of a sample or a
description of a good, which could include advertising, can create an express war-
ranty. Warranties can be created in a variety of ways without being a written part of
the contract.
</p>
<p>Buyers must be aware that the legal system in the United States has repeatedly
ruled that suppliers&rsquo; sales representatives (i.e., special agents) have a natural tendency
to promote the capabilities and performance of their products and services for the
sole purpose of making a sale. In other words, it is not illegal for sellers to exaggerate
the merits of their product during their sales pitch. Because sales personnel are consid-
ered special (not &ldquo;general&rdquo;) agents, it is not illegal for them to exaggerate the merits
of their product. In general, sellers are bound by representations of sales agents un-
less they indicate in the contract that they are not bound.
</p>
<p>For example, consider the following:
</p>
<p>Mike&rsquo;s Bakery needs flour, so Mike goes to Billy Bob&rsquo;s Flour Power Mill.
Billy Bob says that he has a shipment of Grade A flour ready to sell. Billy
Bob says that the shipment is all Grade A flour, and he gives a sample of
the flour to Mike to inspect and provides a written statement describing
the composition of the &ldquo;Grade A flour.&rdquo; The sample of flour that Mike in-
spects meets the requirements for Grade A flour.
</p>
<p>Mike buys the flour, pursuant to a contract of sale for &ldquo;Grade A flour.&rdquo; However,
when the shipment arrives at the bakery, it is not Grade A flour; it is spoiled and full
of worms.
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Mike can sue Billy Bob for breach of an express warranty
that the flour was Grade A flour. The contract said the shipment would be Grade A
flour, and Billy Bob made an affirmation of fact when he told Mike that the ship-
ment was Grade A flour and more importantly provided a written statement describ-
ing the composition of Grade A flour. Further, the sample of flour was an express
warranty that the rest of the flour would be as good as the sample.
</p>
<p>Implied Warranties
The other form of warranty is the implied warranty, which deals with the concept
</p>
<p>of fitness for use and merchantability. These are also part of the contract even
though they are not written, unless they are specifically disclaimed. The implied war-
ranty of fitness for use (particular purpose) means when the seller at the time of con-
tracting has reason to know of any particular purpose for which the goods are
required, and the buyer is relying on the seller&rsquo;s skill or judgment to select or furnish
suitable goods, there is (unless excluded or modified) an implied warranty that the
goods shall be fit for such purpose. For example:
</p>
<p>Mike goes to buy an industrial air-conditioning unit for his bakery. He
goes to Joe&rsquo;s Air-Conditioning Supply Company. Mike describes the size of
his bakery, the amount of heat produced by the machinery, how cool he
wants to keep the facility, and so on. Joe recommends the NotSoHot 1000,

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>and Mike buys it. The machinery turns out to be inadequate: It can&rsquo;t keep
the bakery cool, and it blows out after a few days.
</p>
<p>In this case, Mike can sue Joe for breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a
particular purpose, because Joe had reason to know that Mike was buying an air con-
ditioner for a particular purpose and that Mike relied on Joe&rsquo;s skill and judgment to
select a suitable machine. A warranty of merchantability means that the good being
exchanged meets the standards of the trade and its quality is appropriate for ordi-
nary use. This means that people who are in the business of selling certain products
imply to their customers that the products are of &ldquo;fair average quality.&rdquo; Another
example:
</p>
<p>Mike&rsquo;s Bakery sells 10,000 glazed doughnuts to Dot. Dot runs a retail busi-
ness called Dot&rsquo;s Donut Dollies, which sells coffee, doughnuts, and other
breakfast items. The doughnuts turn out to have been mistakenly glazed
with salt instead of sugar and, as a result, have a terrible flavor.
</p>
<p>Dot can sue Mike for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability, because
Mike&rsquo;s Bakery is a merchant with respect to doughnuts, and the doughnuts are not
fit for the ordinary uses for which such products are used (i.e., enjoyable eating!).
</p>
<p>Warranty of Title and Warranty of Infringement
The purchasing manager in day-to-day activities may occasionally encounter two
</p>
<p>other types of warranties: warranty of title and warranty of infringement. Warranty
of title essentially indicates that the supplier warrants that it has title to the goods
and that they are not stolen or subject to any security interest or liens. In our exam-
ple, Billy Bob warrants that the flour is his to sell to Mike, and that it is not stolen
property. When there are doubts as to the legitimacy of the title to the goods, purchas-
ing managers will need to take additional steps to ensure proper transfer of title, and
ensure that the supplier has the right to sell the product.
</p>
<p>The warranty of infringement refers to the supplier&rsquo;s guarantee that the goods be-
ing exchanged do not illegally infringe on another party&rsquo;s patent protection. The
costs and penalties for patent infringement are so severe that most standard purchas-
ing agreements contain an appropriate patent indemnification clause. If patent in-
fringement is determined, then the damaged party can sue for an injunction to
prevent further use of that item, potentially disrupting a firm&rsquo;s sales of products con-
taining the item in dispute. A simple warranty of infringement in the purchaser&rsquo;s con-
tracts is not enough protection. A broader patent indemnification clause provides a
greater level of safety for the buying organization. For example, if a firm provides de-
sign specifications that infringe on a third party&rsquo;s patent, the organization as well as
the maker of that particular part may be subject to litigation. If the seller warrants
that his goods do not infringe and the buyer obtains an indemnification clause, it
means that the seller is liable to pay the legal expenses and court damages for a
buyer sued by a third party for a patent infringement.
</p>
<p>Patent infringement goes both ways and should be adequately protected against.
</p>
<p>The following general suggestions can help purchasing managers to protect their
organizations against warranty problems:9

<p>&bull; Build a file

<p>Transportation Terms and Risk of Loss
Although very important, transportation documentation and delivery terms are fre-
</p>
<p>quently overlooked as a significant factor in many purchasing contracts. Transporta-
tion documents are used in domestic transportation to govern, direct, control, and
provide information about a shipment.10 Most of the laws governing movement of
freight by truck or rail have been transferred to the new National Surface Transporta-
tion Board (NSTB).
</p>
<p>The bill of lading&mdash;perhaps the most common and singularly important shipping
document&mdash;describes the origin of the shipment, provides specific directions for the
carrier, delineates the transportation contract terms, and functions as a receipt for
the shipment. In some circumstances, the bill of lading may also serve as a certificate
of title for the shipment. The bill of lading contains the following information:
</p>
<p>&bull; The name and address of the consignor and consignee
</p>
<p>&bull; Routing instructions for the carrier
</p>
<p>&bull; A description of the goods being transported
</p>
<p>&bull; The number of items with corresponding commodity descriptions
</p>
<p>&bull; The freight class or rate for the commodity being shipped
</p>
<p>The freight bill serves as the carrier&rsquo;s invoice for the freight charges involved in
the movement of a particular shipment. As part of the freight bill, the NSTB regula-
tions require that credit terms be listed to avoid potential price discrimination be-
tween shippers. Freight bills may be classified as either prepaid or collect, to
determine when the freight bill is to be tendered, regardless of whether the charges
are paid in advance or not. On prepaid shipments, the freight bill is presented on the
effective date of shipment. On collect shipments, the freight bill is presented on the ef-
fective date of delivery. Also, any adverse condition of the shipment should be noted
here to facilitate any potential freight claims with the carrier.
</p>
<p>Under the UCC, the risk of loss is with the seller until the title passes to the buyer.
</p>
<p>However, the following conditions can apply:
</p>
<p>&bull; The buyer and seller can agree in their contract as to when in the transac-
tion the risk of loss becomes the buyer&rsquo;s rather than the seller&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>&bull; If the seller is to ship goods by a third-party carrier, but the seller is not re-
quired to deliver the goods to a specific place (just to take the goods to the
carrier), the risk of loss becomes the buyer&rsquo;s when the goods are delivered to
the carrier.
</p>
<p>&bull; If the seller is required to ship goods to a specific place, the risk of loss be-
comes the buyer&rsquo;s when the goods are delivered to the specific place.
</p>
<p>&bull; If the goods are held by a third party that is responsible for their storage,
such as a commercial warehouse, the risk of loss becomes the buyer&rsquo;s when
the buyer receives certain documents of title or the third party acknowledges
the buyer&rsquo;s right to take the goods.

</p>
<p>Chapter 15 Purchasing Law and Ethics 559</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; If the goods are defective, the risk of loss does not become the buyer&rsquo;s un-
less the defects are fixed or the buyer agrees to accept the defective goods.
</p>
<p>Delivery terms essentially describe who is responsible for the selection of a carrier
and payment of the freight bill, and the method in which the title of goods passes be-
tween the purchaser and the supplier. The term &ldquo;FOB&rdquo; (free on board) delineates the
point at which the supplier is responsible for freight charges and where the purchaser
assumes title to the shipment. &ldquo;FOB shipping point&rdquo; (or &ldquo;FOB origin&rdquo;) indicates that
the purchaser is responsible for payment of transportation costs and assumes title of
the goods at the supplier&rsquo;s shipping dock. &ldquo;FOB destination&rdquo; (or &ldquo;FOB delivered&rdquo;)
tells us that the supplier is responsible for transportation, and the purchaser assumes
title of the goods at his or her own shipping dock. The FOB term also defines which
party is responsible for filing any freight damage claims. Essentially, the party who
possesses title to the goods is responsible for filing the claim. The designation
&ldquo;CIF&rdquo;&mdash;similar to FOB but referring to international shipments&mdash;stands for &ldquo;cost, in-
surance, and freight,&rdquo; so that essentially the contract price includes these costs in addi-
tion to the price of the goods. These costs may also include tariffs, customs duties,
inspections, and so on, so buyers should be especially careful when agreeing to CIF
terms.
</p>
<p>In most cases, a loss results in a freight claim being filed with the carrier to re-
cover payment as a result of shipment loss, damage, or delay. Such documents can
also be filed with the carrier to recover overcharge premiums. In order to be valid,
freight claims must be filed within nine months of the date of actual or reasonable
date of delivery.
</p>
<p>The carrier must respond with an acknowledgment of receipt of the claim within
30 days and then notify the claimant regarding whether or not the claim will be paid
within 120 days. If the claim is not resolved within an additional 120 days, the car-
rier must notify the claimant of the reasons for not settling the claim each 60 days.
</p>
<p>If the carrier has refused to pay the claim, then the claimant has two years from
the time the claim was disallowed to file for legal relief in the courts.
</p>
<p>It is recommended that purchasing managers clearly specify delivery terms in the
purchase contract to ensure that they receive the shipping and freight terms
expected.
</p>
<p>It is important to signify these terms in as much detail as possible, even to the
point of spelling out exact locations including street addresses and dock locations, if
applicable.
</p>
<p>When in doubt, err on the side of increased detail. Unless otherwise specified in
the purchase contract, the UCC recognizes FOB origin as the default delivery term.
</p>
<p>Seller&rsquo;s and Buyer&rsquo;s Rights
</p>
<p>Seller&rsquo;s Rights
Article 2 of the UCC is very specific about sellers&rsquo; and buyers&rsquo; rights. Specifically,
</p>
<p>sellers have the right to do the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Sue the buyer for the purchase price of the goods if the buyer basically re-
fuses to pay for them.
</p>
<p>&bull; Recover reasonable costs and expenses incurred if goods have to be resold.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Receive compensation for additional costs and expenses incurred by reason
of the buyer&rsquo;s wrongful conduct.
</p>
<p>The right to sue for the purchase price of goods is basically a breach of contract
lawsuit. However, if there are still goods in the seller&rsquo;s possession, the seller may be re-
quired to try to resell the goods for a fair price in order to offset what the buyer
owes. This becomes especially important in end-of-life strategies. The buyer should
let the seller know well in advance if a product is going to be discontinued to allow
the seller to deplete existing inventories. If the goods are in the possession of the
seller, the buyer cannot resell them.
</p>
<p>Buyer&rsquo;s Rights
According to the UCC, a buyer&rsquo;s rights include the right to do the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Reject defective goods that the seller cannot repair within a reasonable time.
</p>
<p>&bull; Sue for breach of contract.
</p>
<p>&bull; Revoke acceptance of goods if the buyer discovers defects.
</p>
<p>&bull; Seek a court order forcing the seller to deliver the goods (&ldquo;specific
performance&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>&bull; Recover any extra expense incurred for having to purchase replacement
goods from another seller.
</p>
<p>&bull; Retain the right to recover costs and expenses caused by a breach of
warranty.
</p>
<p>According to Article 2 of the UCC, a buyer can reject defective goods, but that
right is waived once the buyer accepts the goods after having an opportunity to in-
spect. However, the buyer has responsibility with respect to seller goods in the buy-
er&rsquo;s possession. When a buyer accepts delivery of goods from a supplier (including a
pickup from the supplier&rsquo;s plant), the buyer is responsible if it does not catch the de-
fects. This is an excellent argument for certifying suppliers&rsquo; processes and not relying
on inspection as a means to ensure quality. In most cases, a supplier will want to rem-
edy the problem to avoid conflict, but not always. If absolutely necessary, a buyer can
get a court order to force the seller to deliver the goods. This might occur in a capac-
ity problem and is known as &ldquo;specific performance.&rdquo; A buyer can also recover costs
and expenses caused by a breach of warranty, including inspection costs, storage
costs, and return shipment costs.
</p>
<p>Patents and Intellectual Property
As suppliers become increasingly integrated into new-product development, intel-
</p>
<p>lectual property agreements are becoming the norm. The U.S. Constitution provides
the framework for the intellectual property legal system, including patent and copy-
right law, as we know it today, through Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8, which says that
&ldquo;Congress shall have the Power . . . to promote the Progress of Science and useful
Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to
their respective Writings and Discoveries.&rdquo;11 There are three kinds of intellectual prop-
erty in the United States: (1) patents, (2) copyrights, and (3) trade secrets. Patent law
has been established in several federal patent statutes including the Patent Act of
1790, 35 U.S.C. Section 1, and companion laws. Copyright law is founded in the

<p>federal statutes, particularly in the Copyright Act of 1976. Federal patent and copy-
right laws overrule any contradictory state statutes. By contrast, trade secret law is
grounded in common law and is intended to protect unique ideas that would not oth-
erwise have legal protection under patent and copyright law. Because common law
varies by state, there is some variance in actual statutes. However, most states have
created laws that are very similar.

<p>SCENARIO 1
The Mark Anthony Pet Shop writes to Cleopatra, stating, &ldquo;Dear Cleo: A once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity for you. We just received a shipment of asps. They are healthy, friendly,
love kids and make great watch-snakes. As a preferred customer you can receive one for
$50. The price includes fang removal. Please respond by fax only.&rdquo; Cleo sends a letter of ac-
ceptance by regular mail because the UCC allows acceptance by &ldquo;any reasonable means.&rdquo; Is
Cleo&rsquo;s acceptance valid?

<p>SCENARIO 2
The Voyager Ports Steamship Line contracts to buy 50 of the 25-person-capacity lifeboats
from Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s Lifeboat Company. Crusoe ships the 15-person lifeboats instead of
the 25-person ones. Could there be a contract under these conditions?
</p>
<p>SCENARIO 3
Amanda, a buyer for ABC, orders 100,000 RAM devices for delivery on June 1. On May 10 the
seller advises Amanda there will be no shipment on June 1 due to production problems.
What are Amanda&rsquo;s alternatives?
</p>
<p>ANSWERS
</p>
<p>SCENARIO 1
Cleo&rsquo;s acceptance is not valid because Mark Anthony specifically and unambiguously asked
for a fax. Although acceptance through any reasonable means is normally valid, offerors can
restrict the acceptable means of acceptance as long as they do so unambiguously.
</p>
<p>SCENARIO 2
There is a contract only if Voyager Ports Steamship accepts the nonconforming goods. This
could occur in the following ways: (1) notifying Crusoe that it will take the boats even
though they are nonconforming; (2) failing to inspect them after a reasonable time to do so;
and (3) acting inconsistently with Crusoe&rsquo;s ownership (UCC Section 2-606), such as attach-
ing the lifeboats to Voyager&rsquo;s ships.
</p>
<p>SCENARIO 3
UCC Section 2-217 states that after a breach the buyer is entitled to cover by going into the
market and buying the goods to replace those not forthcoming. The buyer must recover from
the seller the difference between the contract price and cover price. The buyer may also re-
cover any incidental and consequential damages less any expenses saved as a result of the
cover.

<p>562 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In its most basic form, a patent is an agreement between the inventor and the fed-
eral government. Successful patentees in the United States are now entitled to exclu-
sive rights (to make, use, or sell) an invention for the life of the patent 20 years from
the filing date with the U.S. Patent Office.
</p>
<p>Although the inventor has exclusive rights (i.e., a monopoly) to the invention dur-
ing the patent period, others gain that right to the benefits of the invention following
expiration of the protection period, thereby providing public benefit. A U.S. patent is
applicable only to the inventor&rsquo;s exclusive use within the borders of the United
States. Inventors wishing to expand their patent protection to other countries must
file appropriate patent applications in each country in which protection is desired.
</p>
<p>Note that in some countries, such as China and India, copyrights and patents may
not be recognized at all. In recent years, because of the entry of these countries into
the World Trade Organization, both China and India recognize copyrights (at least
verbally), but piracy remains a constant problem.
</p>
<p>A firm needs to protect itself from inadvertent patent infringement whenever it
purchases a product from a supplier. This can best be done by including a patent in-
demnification clause in all purchasing documents. This clause should consist of three
parts:
</p>
<p>1. An indemnification, which seeks the supplier&rsquo;s assurances that the goods be-
ing contracted for do not infringe on any other party&rsquo;s patents
</p>
<p>2. The right to require the supplier to defend any patent infringement suit itself
</p>
<p>3. The right to have the purchaser&rsquo;s own attorneys involved in defense of any
lawsuit concerning patent infringement
</p>
<p>The UCC provides minimal protection for the purchasers in defending themselves
against legal actions stemming from patent infringement. Therefore, indemnification
agreements should be included in contracts with suppliers whenever possible.
</p>
<p>A copyright is designed to afford protection for persons who create original works
such as books, software, songs, and films. A copyright on written material is gener-
ally good for the life of the author plus 50 years. Copyright law does not require a for-
mal application, as does patent law. In addition, it is not necessary for the copyright
originator to place any legend or indication on the protected material indicating that
the material is copyrighted. Copyright is automatically assumed. However, most legal
experts recommend that some sort of language in the form of a copyright notice be in-
cluded on any works desired to be protected, along with the copyright symbol: &copy;.
This notice provides evidence that the creator of the article in question intends to

<p>Trade secret protection becomes essentially self-serving through the actions of the
organization itself. For instance, if information that could otherwise be considered
trade secrets is not protected through devices such as limited access or other security
precautions, then the courts have ruled that this information is not confidential and,
therefore, not entitled to protection. This test of confidential information can also be
applied to any information that suppliers provide to the purchasing firm through the
normal course of business dealings. As before, however, the supplier must make it
known that the information is proprietary and is to be kept confidential. As a precau-
tion, any information provided to a supplier should be accompanied by notification
that the information is provided in confidence and should be treated as such by the
supplier. This is typically known as a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). See Exhibit
15.3 for an example of a nondisclosure agreement.

<p>Other Laws Affecting Purchasing
</p>
<p>Laws Affecting Antitrust and Unfair Trade Practices
A number of federal laws deal with antitrust and competitive practices of inter-
</p>
<p>state commerce. Each law seeks to promote the fair conduct of business and preserve
competition in markets. Although most of these laws apply to the conduct of the
seller, some provisions apply directly or indirectly to purchasers.
</p>
<p>Sherman Antitrust Act (1890)
This law prohibits actions that are &ldquo;in restraint of trade&rdquo; or actions that attempt
</p>
<p>to monopolize a market or create a monopoly. Price fixing, dividing territories
among competitors, and agreements that limit the supply of a commodity are viola-
tions of the Sherman Act. However, the law also prohibits reciprocity or reciprocal
purchase agreements, where the effect of such agreements limits competition.
</p>
<p>Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA, 1914)
This act authorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to interpret trade legisla-
</p>
<p>tion, including the provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act that deal with restraint
of trade. The FTCA also addresses unfair competition and unfair or deceptive trade
practices. Unfair trade practices include (1) those that allow large firms to gain advan-
tage over smaller rivals; (2) predatory competition; (3) restraint of trade; and (4) mis-
leading or deceptive practices such as false advertising.
</p>
<p>Clayton Antitrust Act (1914)
This law, which broadened the Sherman Act, makes price discrimination illegal
</p>
<p>and prohibits sellers from exclusive arrangements with purchasers or product dis-
tributors. One of the most common exclusive agreements is a tying agreement, where
a supplier makes the sale of one product contingent upon the sale of another prod-
uct. Thus suppliers must make unbundled individual products available to buyers. Ex-
clusive agreements are those where the buyer must purchase all requirements from
one supplier. Price discrimination between different purchasers is prohibited if such
discrimination substantially lessens competition or tends to create a monopoly in any
line of commerce.

<p>Chapter 15 Purchasing Law and Ethics 565</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Robinson-Patman Act (1936)
This law strengthens the Clayton Act by clarifying the issue of price discrimina-
</p>
<p>tion, particularly as it pertains to limiting the powers of large buyers. It prohibits sell-
ers from offering a discriminatory price where the effect of discrimination may limit
competition or create a monopoly. There is also a provision that prohibits purchasers
from inducing a discriminatory price. Although a seller may legally lower a price as
a concession during negotiations, the purchaser should not mislead or trick the
seller, thus resulting in a price that is discriminatory to other buyers in the market.
Robinson-Patman violations occur when different prices are charged to different buy-
ers. Thus most sellers develop uniform pricing policies that are subject to quantity dis-
counts as a result of economic scale advantages for producing and selling larger
quantities.
</p>
<p>The law makes provision for price differences in certain situations. First, as men-
tioned above, is for differences in costs of manufacturing or sale due to quantities
and methods of production and distribution. Second is the good-faith attempt to
meet a lower competitive price. Third is if the goods are perishable via deterioration,
seasonality, or distress sales under court orders.
</p>
<p>Laws Affecting Global Purchasing
Many laws&mdash;U.S., foreign, and international&mdash;affect global commerce. The follow-
</p>
<p>ing briefly summarizes some of the laws that can affect a purchaser&rsquo;s international
business dealings.12
</p>
<p>The United Nations Convention on Contracts for International
Sale of Goods (CISG)
</p>
<p>This is an attempt by the United Nations to facilitate international trade by remov-
ing legal barriers. Unless the parties have specified to the contrary, the CISG applies
to the sale of goods between parties with places of business in the contracting states.
Contracting states are countries that have ratified the CISG. As of 2006 there were 70
countries that had ratified the CISG. These 70 countries account for 75% of the
world&rsquo;s trade. One of the key provisions to its success is the flexibility to take excep-
tion to specified articles of the code on a contract-by-contract basis.
</p>
<p>Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
This law prohibits payments (such as bribes) that might benefit a foreign official
</p>
<p>personally. Although the law usually pertains to sellers, purchasers should under-
stand its provisions so they can recognize situations addressed by the act.
</p>
<p>Anti-Boycott Legislation
Various laws address doing business with countries that support the boycott of
</p>
<p>one nation against another. Examples include the boycott of Israel by Arab countries
and the boycott of Taiwan by mainland China. These laws require reporting of any re-
quest to participate in a boycott, which purchasers often fail to do.
</p>
<p>Export Administration Act
Various laws and regulations govern, and sometimes even restrict, the export of
</p>
<p>goods, information, and services. Purchasers may not perceive that they are engaged

<p>in exporting. However, the law views certain types of drawings, specifications, and
prototypes forwarded to a foreign entity as restricted exports of technology. Pur-
chasers are urged to seek the advice of an expert when questions arise in this area.
</p>
<p>Customs Laws
This body of law addresses the importation of goods into the United States. Cus-
</p>
<p>toms brokers who are familiar with customs laws can be quite valuable in understand-
ing the rules and regulations governing importation.
</p>
<p>Foreign Laws
In addition to the U.S. laws that apply to foreign transactions, the laws and regula-
</p>
<p>tions of other countries involved in a business transaction may also apply. These
laws will likely address contract law, export control, currency control, and criminal
law. Some transactions could be illegal if structured in a certain manner.
</p>
<p>International Laws
Other laws may apply to a business transaction that are not part of any specific
</p>
<p>country&rsquo;s laws and regulations. Maritime laws are a good example of international
laws that affect international commerce. Several international documents are also per-
tinent to international transactions. These include International Contracting Terms.
</p>
<p>The laws governing purchasing are complex and varied. Other laws address envi-
ronmental and labor issues. This overview simply points out that today&rsquo;s purchaser
must be aware of the laws and regulations governing domestic and international
purchasing.
</p>
<p>A purchaser is urged to discuss with legal counsel any questions that arise during
the performance of job responsibilities. Ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.
</p>
<p>Purchasing Ethics
Ethics have their basis in the field of philosophy and identify common principles
</p>
<p>associated with appropriate versus inappropriate actions, moral duty, and obligation.
Ethics are the set of moral principles or values guiding our behavior. In a business set-
ting, ethical behavior is the use of recognized social principles involving justice and
fairness throughout a business relationship. When interacting with suppliers, an ethi-
cal buyer treats them in a just, decent, fair, honest, and fitting manner. Being ethical
means following a code viewed as fair by those within the profession as well as the
community.13 A 2004 study on purchasing education and training requirements indi-
cated ethics was the number one knowledge requirement now and forecasted to be
five years into the future.14
</p>
<p>Three rules are understood to be a part of ethical behavior. First, buyers must com-
mit their attention and energies for the organization&rsquo;s benefit rather than personal en-
richment at the expense of the organization. Ethical buyers do not accept outside
gifts or favors that violate their firm&rsquo;s ethics policy. Ethical buyers are also not
tempted or influenced by the unethical practices of salespeople and do not have
personal financial arrangements with suppliers. Second, a buyer must act ethically
toward suppliers or potential suppliers. This means treating each supplier profes-
sionally and with respect. Finally, buyers must uphold the ethical standards set forth

<p>by their profession. A code or statement of professional ethics usually formalizes the
set of ethical standards.
</p>
<p>Purchasing managers, more than any other group within a firm, experience enor-
mous pressure to act in unethical ways. This occurs for several reasons. First, purchas-
ing has direct control over large sums of money. A buyer responsible for a
multimillion-dollar contract may find sellers using any means available to secure a fa-
vorable position. The very nature of purchasing means that a buyer must come in con-
tact with outside, and occasionally unethical, sellers. A second reason is the pressure
placed on many salespeople. A seller that must meet aggressive sales goals might
resort to questionable sales practices.
</p>
<p>Risks of Unethical Behavior
A buyer who performs an unethical act runs the risk that the act is also illegal.
</p>
<p>For example, a government buyer who accepts payment from a defense contractor
has clearly committed an unethical and illegal act. If this payment becomes known,
the buyer risks legal penalty as defined by the law. The buyer&rsquo;s firm also risks a legal
penalty. At a minimum, the buyer will probably lose his or her job.
</p>
<p>Unethical behavior also presents a personal risk to a buyer&rsquo;s professional reputation.
</p>
<p>Sellers quickly become aware of buyers who are open to offers &ldquo;on the side.&rdquo; Once
a buyer earns a reputation within an industry, it is difficult to change it. A buyer also
runs a risk that management will discover his or her lack of ethics and terminate em-
ployment. A professional reputation is something a buyer carries throughout an en-
tire career. If a buyer is found guilty of accepting a bribe, companies will not only
terminate the buyer, but may often pursue litigation as well. Personal financial bank-
ruptcy or even jail sentences can result for buyers who are found guilty of accepting
large bribes.
</p>
<p>A final risk of unethical behavior is the risk to a firm&rsquo;s reputation. A buyer who
makes purchase decisions based on factors other than legitimate business criteria
risks the reputation of the entire firm. For example, quality may suffer if a buyer ac-
cepts substandard performance from a supplier that offered outside inducements. A
buyer&rsquo;s unethical behavior can jeopardize the livelihood of others dependent on a
firm&rsquo;s success. World-class suppliers do not have to practice unethical behavior to
win contracts.
</p>
<p>To summarize the legal perspective, accepting a supplier&rsquo;s outside gifts and favors
in exchange for special treatment is a form of corruption. The U.S. business environ-
ment does not treat unethical behavior lightly. Buyers who practice unethical behav-
ior subject themselves and their firms to increased risk and diminish the integrity of
the purchasing profession. Firms dealing with global sourcing sometimes encounter
unethical behavior, particularly in developing countries, where bribery may be viewed
as a routine source of extra income. However, global firms are increasingly adopting
an unequivocal zero-tolerance stance toward any form of bribery, even if it means
sacrificing short-term profitability to maintain a global reputation of integrity and
honesty in its dealings with suppliers. Further, the main provisions of the Foreign Cor-
rupt Practices Act (part of the securities laws) make it illegal to bribe government offi-
cials in foreign countries and prevent companies from deducting bribes from their
federal taxes.S

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Types of Unethical Purchasing Behavior
Suppose a buyer at Firm XYZ has the highest moral and ethical values&mdash;the buyer
</p>
<p>has strong beliefs about what is proper behavior within the purchasing profession.
Conflict can occur if a supervisor asks the buyer to do something the buyer feels is un-
ethical. For example, a manager may ask a buyer to award a contract because of a per-
sonal friendship with a supplier. The buyer may feel this is unethical.
</p>
<p>Does the buyer simply award the contract in compliance with the manager&rsquo;s in-
struction, and ignore his or her own personal and moral values? Or does the buyer re-
fuse to award the contract, thereby challenging the authority of a manager and
jeopardizing his or her career? Although a professional buyer should know the differ-
ence between right and wrong, organizational pressures can force a buyer to behave
in ways that conflict with personal values, which creates a difficult situation for the in-
dividual. How should a person respond in this situation?
</p>
<p>The definition of ethical behavior can differ from buyer to buyer or from firm to
firm. Despite these possible differences, most professionals recognize certain behavior
or actions as unethical. Most companies have established guidelines that reinforce
that these behaviors are unethical and therefore unacceptable. Some of these beha-
viors are listed below.
</p>
<p>Reciprocity
This action involves giving preferential treatment to suppliers that are also cus-
</p>
<p>tomers of the buying organization.15 In simple terms, it refers to a purchasing arrange-
ment that dictates &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy from you if you buy from me.&rdquo; The Federal Trade
Commission has taken an aggressive stance against reciprocal buying arrangements,
ruling that it is illegal &ldquo;to abusively use large buying power to restrict competitive mar-
ket opportunities.&rdquo; In the early 1970s, many larger firms entered into agreements
with the FTC forbidding reciprocal purchasing. These firms also eliminated their in-
ternal trade departments established to coordinate these arrangements.16
</p>
<p>FTC rulings have convinced most firms to prohibit reciprocal purchasing. Most
firms do recognize a customer&rsquo;s right for consideration as a potential supplier. A
buyer, however, must rely only on legitimate performance criteria to evaluate sup-
plier capability.
</p>
<p>Personal Buying
This occurs when a purchasing department purchases material for the personal
</p>
<p>needs of its employees. Some states have outlawed such practices with statutes called
&ldquo;trade diversion laws.&rdquo; These laws prohibit purchasing from engaging in personal buy-
ing for items not required during the normal course of business.
</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to these laws. For example, a firm can purchase safety
shoes, hats, gloves, or even special tools required by the employee. A purchasing de-
partment can use its knowledge to purchase products conforming to specific quality
standards. Personal buying is a gray area for some purchasing departments. Some
firms view personal buying as a fringe benefit and service to the employee. Other
firms flatly prohibit the practice. A buyer confronted with a request for personal buy-
ing should determine the legal status of the practice, and then discuss the subject
with management. S

</p>
<p>Chapter 15 Purchasing Law and Ethics 569</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Accepting Supplier Favors
Accepting gifts and favors from a supplier is the most common ethical infraction
</p>
<p>involving buyers. These gifts and favors can affect a buyer&rsquo;s judgment to evaluate and
select the most capable suppliers. The policy on supplier offerings is often a confus-
ing issue. At what point does a supplier&rsquo;s gift or favor depart from a friendly show-
ing of appreciation for a firm&rsquo;s business to an attempt to influence a buyer&rsquo;s purchase
decisions? Accepting free items from potential suppliers is especially questionable.
Here, a supplier does not even have a purchase contract. Firms can address this issue
in their ethics policy by specifying exactly what a buyer may accept from a supplier.
</p>
<p>Sharp Practices
A sharp practice is any misrepresentation by a buyer that falls just short of actual
</p>
<p>fraud.17 Sharp practice occurs whenever a buyer &ldquo;plays games&rdquo; with a supplier and op-
erates in an underhanded manner. The practice includes many different behaviors:
</p>
<p>&bull; Willful use of misinformation, when a buyer knowingly deceives a supplier
to realize some advantage. For example, requesting quotes on inflated vol-
umes and then placing smaller orders at the reduced price is a willful use of
misinformation.
</p>
<p>&bull; Exaggerating problems. A buyer who exaggerates the size of a supplier-
caused problem to extract a larger penalty or concession from a supplier is
using a sharp practice.
</p>
<p>&bull; Requesting bids from unqualified suppliers for the sole purpose of driving a
qualified supplier&rsquo;s price lower. A buyer should request bids from qualified
suppliers only.
</p>
<p>&bull; Gaining information unfairly through deception.
</p>
<p>&bull; Sharing information on competitive quotations. The integrity of the competi-
tive bid process requires confidentiality. Buyers who share supplier-quoted
information violate the ethics of the bid process.
</p>
<p>&bull; Not compensating a supplier for design or other work. Buyers often request
design and cost-savings assistance from suppliers. A supplier that helps a
buyer should receive fair compensation for its efforts.
</p>
<p>&bull; Taking unfair advantage of a supplier&rsquo;s financial situation. A buyer who
knowingly pressures a financially troubled supplier into providing a lower-
than-normal price places the supplier in further financial jeopardy. Taking
advantage of a financially susceptible supplier is an unethical business
practice.
</p>
<p>&bull; Lying or misleading. Any instance of lying or misleading a seller is a sharp
practice.
</p>
<p>Financial Conflicts of Interest
When a buyer awards business to a supplier because the buyer, the buyer&rsquo;s family,
</p>
<p>or relatives of the buyer have a direct financial interest in a supplier, this is consid-
ered a major unethical practice. This behavior is one reason many companies require
employees to detail any investments in outside companies.

tive buying or selling stock because of inside knowledge, which is an illegal act.
</p>
<p>Influence and Ethics
Influence and attempts to influence decisions exist at several points in the supply
</p>
<p>chain. Recently, the Institute for Supply Management&rsquo;s (ISM&rsquo;s) Ethical Standards
Committee addressed this important issue. Influence can be defined in several ways.
Most frequently, influence is defined as the power to sway: &ldquo;the power that some-
body has to affect other people&rsquo;s thinking or actions by means of argument, exam-
ple, or force of personality.&rdquo; Supply professionals regularly make decisions about
what their organization buys, who they buy from, how much they buy, and how
they buy it. Often, they also have input into the specifications and requirements sur-
rounding the purchase. Suppliers regularly work to influence the decisions of supply
professionals.18
</p>
<p>Supply professionals must overcome the negative aspects of influence to ensure
that they are objective in their decision making and that they are operating in an ethi-
cal manner. Influences such as (1) suppliers sharing new ideas, methodologies, and
technologies, (2) sharing data when being involved early in design issues, and (3) a
cross-functional team being involved in a comparative analysis of competing suppli-
ers are positive and appropriate influences; they add value to decision making,
whereas other influences may detract from the quality of decisions. Negative sources
of influence conflict with the goal of supply professionals and other leaders to man-
age their responsibilities according to ethical guidelines set forth by their organiza-
tions or ISM. Examples of negative influences include (1) giving personal interests
priority over employer interests; (2) inappropriate sharing of confidential or proprie-
tary information with suppliers; and (3) accepting gifts, entertainment, or meals as a
reward for a decision that could be made in favor of the supplier. These negative fac-
tors can have a negative impact on an organization.19
</p>
<p>An ethics survey by the ISM&rsquo;s Ethical Standards Committee (see p. 572) showed
that influence is a challenge for supply professionals. Survey results related to influ-
ence revealed that inappropriate preference for suppliers in sourcing decisions was a
concern from 34% of the survey respondents, and politics inappropriately influencing
sourcing decisions was a concern to 46% of respondents. Although only 6 to 7% of
supply professionals were concerned about gifts, entertainment, and meals influenc-
ing sourcing decisions within their function, over 40% of the survey respondents indi-
cated that individuals outside of their function received gifts, entertainment, or meals
from suppliers.20 It is important for supply professionals to be aware of the subtleties
of influence so that they can better manage the potential impact on their decisions
and behaviors. Regardless of the culture or continent, influence is a reality, and the
goal of the supply professional is to appropriately manage it.
</p>
<p>ISM Professional Code of Ethics
The Institute for Supply Management is the largest organization representing the
</p>
<p>purchasing profession. In 1959, the ISM officially adopted its initial Standards of
Conduct.
</p>
<p>The document serves as a guide for the ISM membership by imposing rules of con-
duct, particularly when a buyer&rsquo;s own company lacks a policy or statement of ethics.

<p>Chapter 15 Purchasing Law and Ethics 571</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In the words of the code, &ldquo;It is necessary for all of us to exercise a strict rule of per-
sonal conduct to insure that relations of a compromising nature, or even the appear-
ance of such relations, be scrupulously avoided.&rdquo; The document reflects the ISM&rsquo;s
commitment to ethical behavior and fair business dealings.
</p>
<p>The Standards of Conduct specifies three guiding principles of purchasing prac-
tice: (1) loyalty to company, (2) justice to those with whom a buyer deals, and (3)
faith in the purchasing profession. From these principles ISM derived its standards of
purchasing practice, or Code of Ethics:
</p>
<p>1. Consider, first, the interest of your company in all transactions and carry out
and believe in its established policies.
</p>
<p>2. Be receptive to competent counsel from your colleagues and be guided by
such counsel without impairing the dignity and responsibility of your office.
</p>
<p>3. Buy without prejudice, seeking to obtain the maximum value for each dollar
of expenditure.
</p>
<p>4. Strive consistently for knowledge of the materials and processes of manufac-
ture and establish practical methods for the conduct of your office.
</p>
<p>5. Subscribe to and work for honesty and truth in buying and selling, and de-
nounce all forms and manifestations of commercial bribery.
</p>
<p>6. Accord a prompt and courteous reception, so far as conditions will permit, to
all who call on a legitimate business mission.
</p>
<p>7. Respect your obligations and require that obligations to you and to your con-
cern be respected, consistent with good business practice.
</p>
<p>8. Avoid sharp practice.
</p>
<p>9. Counsel and assist fellow purchasing managers in the performance of their du-
ties, whenever the occasion permits.
</p>
<p>10. Cooperate with all organizations and individuals engaged in activities de-
signed to enhance the development and standing of purchasing.
</p>
<p>These standards often help guide a firm&rsquo;s ethical code of conduct and policy.
</p>
<p>The ISM standards specifically state that its members should maintain standards
on an even higher plane than those accepted by society&mdash;what becomes the &ldquo;true test
of greatness.&rdquo; This is stated as follows in the code:

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Nothing can undermine respect for the purchasing profession more than im-
proper action on the part of its members with regard to gifts, gratuities, or
favors. People engaged in purchasing should not accept from any supplier
or prospective supplier any money, gift, or favor that might influence, or be
suspected of influencing, their buying decisions. We must decline to accept
or must return any such gift or favor offered us or members of our immedi-
ate family. The declination of these gifts or favors must be done discreetly
and courteously. Possible embarrassment resulting from refusals does not
constitute a basis for exception.
</p>
<p>The ISM Standards of Conduct is a powerful document. It holds the purchasing
profession to the highest levels of ethical conduct. Companies of all sizes from many
industries have used the Code of Ethics as a guide when developing their own ethical
policies.
</p>
<p>Supporting Ethical Behavior
A firm can take many actions to make sure its employees conduct business in an
</p>
<p>ethical manner. The following sections summarize the actions a firm can take to en-
hance the ethical behavior of its purchasing personnel.
</p>
<p>Developing a Statement of Ethics
Most research on purchasing ethics concludes that adopting a formal ethics policy
</p>
<p>helps define and deter potentially unethical purchasing behavior. An earlier study
found that firms without formal ethical policies disclosed supplier bid prices to other
suppliers at a much higher rate than firms with a formal policy prohibiting this prac-
tice.21 Also, firms without a formal ethics policy were more likely to make discounted
purchases for their employees, a questionable practice in some states. A formal ethics
policy helps define the boundaries of ethical behavior.
</p>
<p>Top-Management Commitment
Executive management sets the ethical code of behavior within a firm. Although
</p>
<p>the highest executive may not actually write a firm&rsquo;s purchasing or marketing code of
ethics, the ethical behavior of top executives sends a message about whether or not un-
ethical behavior is tolerated. Lower-level managers quickly recognize top manage-
ment&rsquo;s commitment to ethical behavior and imitate the commitment, especially when
other managers are fired because of their unethical behavior! (See the Good Practice
Example on Eaton Corporation at the end of this chapter.)
</p>
<p>Closer Buyer-Seller Relationships
Dealing with a smaller supply base or a single supplier for an item will probably
</p>
<p>do more for ethical purchasing behavior than any other recent trend or action. Firms
are increasingly using buying teams to evaluate potential suppliers across different per-
formance categories. Using a team approach to evaluate a supplier&rsquo;s capabilities lim-
its the opportunity for unethical behavior. Unethical suppliers will find it tougher to
influence a team of professionals.
</p>
<p>Ethical Training
New buyers, usually at larger firms, often enter a training program before actu-
</p>
<p>ally assuming their professional duties. One part of the training usually deals with

</p>
<p>Chapter 15 Purchasing Law and Ethics 573</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>purchasing ethics. Such a program is an opportunity to educate a new buyer
about a firm&rsquo;s ethics policy. Firms often use role playing to help buyers learn how
to identify different types of unethical behavior and how to confront and deal
with these situations. Ethics training reinforces a firm&rsquo;s commitment to the highest
ethical standards.
</p>
<p>Developing Consistent Behavior
Confusion about proper ethical behavior can arise when marketing and purchas-
</p>
<p>ing have separate ethical standards. A firm that prohibits its purchasing personnel
from accepting gifts from suppliers but allows its marketing department to distribute
gifts to its customers is not acting consistently. When different standards of behavior
exist within the same firm, it becomes easier for one group to rationalize or justify un-
ethical behavior. How can it be ethical for one group (marketing) to provide gifts
and favors but unethical for another group (purchasing) within the same firm to ac-
cept any items?
</p>
<p>Internal Reporting of Unethical Behavior
Executive purchasing management should create an atmosphere that supports the
</p>
<p>reporting of unethical behavior. A buyer should be able to approach management
about an ethical impropriety with confidence that management will correct the prob-
lem. A firm should also encourage suppliers to report instances of unethical behavior
by anyone within the buying firm.
</p>
<p>Preventive Measures (Commodity Rotation and Limits of Authority)
One common strategy is to rotate buyers among different items or commodities,
</p>
<p>which prevents a buyer from becoming too comfortable with any particular group of
suppliers. Although a buyer should become familiar with purchased items and suppli-
ers, it is often a good idea to rotate personnel between buying assignments. Rotation
usually occurs every several years.
</p>
<p>Another preventive measure is to limit a buyer&rsquo;s purchase authority without
higher-level approval. For example, a firm&rsquo;s policy may limit a buyer&rsquo;s authority for
awarding purchase contracts to amounts of $10,000 or less. Contracts greater than
$10,000 then require a manager&rsquo;s signature. A buyer must justify the selection deci-
sion based on sound purchasing criteria before obtaining the final sign-off. This pro-
vides a system of checks and balances and reduces the possibility of unethical
supplier selection
</p>
<p>Although there is a fine line between ethical and legal behavior, we believe that eth-
ics should always come first. However, it is also important that a qualified purchas-
ing manager develop a detailed understanding of purchasing law. Having good
working knowledge of legal issues can have a positive impact on daily and long-term
actions in the profession.
</p>
<p>Corporate Social Responsibility
Corporate social responsibility is the idea that organizations and institutions have an
</p>
<p>obligation to society that extends beyond compliance with regulations in considering
the broader effects of their actions. Social responsibility is becoming more accepted

<p>574 Part 4 Strategic Sourcing Process</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>in 21st-century corporations. ISM has developed a guide to assist supply managers in
developing their socially responsible practices. The areas covered in the policy are (1)
community; (2) diversity; (3) environment; (4) ethics; (5) financial responsibility; (6)
human rights; and (7) safety. Many of these topics are covered in Chapters 7 and 8
on supplier strategies and selection. This chapter has discussed ethics and to a lesser
extent community issues. We will focus on the environmental issues in the remain-
der of this chapter; ISM&rsquo;s Principles of Social Responsibility encourage buyers to be
proactive with suppliers and customers in creating a culture of environmental respon-
sibility (see Exhibit 15.4 on p. 576).
</p>
<p>The environment under the green movement is becoming a large initiative, as sev-
eral major corporations have become aware of the need to reduce their impact on
the environment. For example, G.E.&rsquo;s chairman, Jeffrey Immelt, has made a big push
toward making G.E. a corporate leader in addressing climate change. Immelt has
stated he &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t want to change the economic flow of the company.&rdquo; Thus, G.E.
still sells coal-fired steam turbines and is delving deeper into oil and gas production.
However, its campaign dubbed &ldquo;eco-imagination&rdquo; was expected to sell $14 billion of
environmentally friendly products in 2007 and is forecasted to grow another 10% in
2008. The firm also claims it has reduced its gas emissions by 4% in the past two
years.22
</p>
<p>General Motors has announced plans to invest in researching environmentally
friendly technologies for the Chinese market. GM&rsquo;s investment will be part of a $250
million corporate campus and will involve collaboration with its local joint venture
partners, the Chinese government and academia. Research will focus on several green
technologies, such as hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, alternative fuels, and new en-
gine technologies.23
</p>
<p>In addition, firms are asking supply managers to press their suppliers on increas-
ing environmental efforts. A group of firms called the Supply Chain Leadership Coun-
cil has partnered with the London-based Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) to assist
in implementing this project. CDP monitors the &ldquo;carbon footprints&rdquo; that firms emit.
Carbon footprints are estimates of the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by firms in
producing and distributing their products. Many firms measure the direct emissions
such as the energy consumed in lighting their stores or the gas consumed in transport-
ing it.24
</p>
<p>Looking upstream produces a more comprehensive footprint because more emis-
sions are involved in making the products. These end-to-end measures are leading
firms such as Cadbury Schweppes to calculate the amount of carbon released in mak-
ing a milk chocolate dairy bar from the farm through the factory and into the store.
Future labels could contain a carbon footprint number along with the calories and
ingredients.25
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart has also started asking suppliers about their carbon footprint. Oakhurst
Dairy, a major dairy supplier located in Portland, Maine, was asked to measure the car-
bon footprint of a case of milk. The result is that the company is looking at reducing
energy use by converting delivery trucks to biodiesel and installing solar hot-water hea-
ters for washing milk crates, thus reducing the company&rsquo;s carbon footprint.26
</p>
<p>Finally, going green may be a great source of talent. &ldquo;Students are looking to work
for companies that care about the environment,&rdquo; claims author Lindsey Pollak. &ldquo;They
are almost expecting greenness like they expect work-life balance, ethnic diversity,
and globalization.&rdquo; To attract students, corporations are advertising their

<p>environmental efforts. For example, Merrill Lynch outlines its environmental in-
itiatives on the back of every recruiting brochure. One college student interviewed no-
ticed that the companies he wanted to work for have their environmental policies
prominently displayed on their websites.27
</p>
<p>Exhibit 15.4 ISM Principles of Social Responsibility
</p>
<p>Social responsibility is defined as a framework of measurable corporate policies and procedures and
resulting behavior designed to benefit the workplace and, by extension, the individual, the organiza-
tion, and the community in the following areas (in alphabetical order):
</p>
<p>I. Community

</p>
<p>1. Proactively promote purchasing from, and the development of, socially diverse suppliers.
</p>
<p>2. Encourage diversity within your own organization.
</p>
<p>3. Proactively promote diverse employment practices throughout the supply chain.
</p>
<p>III. Environment
</p>
<p>1. Encourage your own organization and others to be proactive in examining opportunities to be
environmentally responsible within their supply chains either &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; or &ldquo;downstream.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>2. Encourage the environmental responsibility of your suppliers.
</p>
<p>3. Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly practices and products
throughout your organization.
</p>
<p>IV. Ethics
</p>
<p>1. Be aware of ISM&rsquo;s Principles and Standards of Ethical Supply Management Conduct.
</p>
<p>2. Abide by your organization&rsquo;s code of conduct.
</p>
<p>V. Financial Responsibility
</p>
<p>1. Become knowledgeable of, and follow, applicable financial standards and requirements.
</p>
<p>2. Apply sound financial practices and ensure transparency in financial dealings.
</p>
<p>3. Actively promote and practice responsible financial behavior throughout the supply chain.
</p>
<p>VI. Human Rights
</p>
<p>1. Treat people with dignity and respect.
</p>
<p>2. Support and respect the protection of international human rights within the organization&rsquo;s sphere
of influence.
</p>
<p>3. Encourage your organization and its supply chains to avoid complicity in human or employment
rights abuses.
</p>
<p>VII. Safety
</p>
<p>1. Promote a safe environment for each employee in your organization and supply chain. (Each
organization is responsible for defining &ldquo;safe&rdquo; within its organization.)
</p>
<p>2. Support the continuous development and diffusion of safety practices throughout your
organization and the supply chain.

<p>Good Practice
Example
</p>
<p>Eaton&rsquo;s CEO Talks Openly
about Ethics
</p>
<p>When Eaton Corporation Chairman and CEO Alexander M. (Sandy) Cutler addressed the
winners of the company&rsquo;s Supplier Excellence Awards, he thanked the winners and explained
the company&rsquo;s goals. But the goals he emphasized didn&rsquo;t include price reductions. Instead,
he talked about values. &ldquo;We want to be the most admired company in our markets through
supply chain performance,&rdquo; he told the attendees. &ldquo;Have the right ethics and the right busi-
ness practices and you&rsquo;ll attract the best people and suppliers who&rsquo;ll produce the best re-
sults,&rdquo; Cutler said. The company has an ombudsman for ethics, with whom employees or
anyone else can confer. And Eaton doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to stop doing business with suppliers
whose business practices aren&rsquo;t up to its own high standards, regardless of the supplier&rsquo;s
quality or prices.
</p>
<p>Cutler speaks frankly about ethics and ethical issues that have faced Eaton, and how the
company has dealt with them. Eaton has published a new ethics guide&mdash;translated into 14
languages&mdash;that will go to all employees to help them understand Eaton&rsquo;s expectations and
their responsibilities. Cutler specifically discussed several examples that arose with respect
to ethical issues and globalization:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had an issue many years ago where we were doing some advanced product develop-
ment work for a significant global OEM customer. There were established timetables for devel-
opment, testing, and shipment, and our customer was expecting the fully tested product to
be shipped at the end of a particular quarter. When it came to the end of that quarter, not
all of the testing had been accomplished. Two senior operating managers in the United
States falsified the test results and thereby misrepresented the product&rsquo;s readiness for ship-
ment. Both signed the reports willingly. Upon investigation, we learned that they felt they
should do this in order to meet the targeted shipment timetables, because they thought this
was what both Eaton and the customer wanted. Yet clearly this was a violation of Eaton&rsquo;s
quality and ethics policies. We terminated the two managers. Both had been high-potential,
highly promotable people.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We learned a lesson from this incident&mdash;that integrity can break down at any level, no mat-
ter how much you preach and teach ethics. These were respected managers who had per-
formed well for years. But they made a serious, serious mistake in judgment.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not tolerate any compromise of our standards for quality. Nor will we knowingly vio-
late any laws or regulations in any country. At Eaton, we do not practice what I call &lsquo;geo-
graphic&rsquo; ethics. We have one set of ethics worldwide. And if the laws and regulations of a
given country differ from our own company standards, we comply with whatever requirement
represents the higher standard of behavior in that situation.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s common knowledge that governments in certain parts of the world demand substantial
payments in exchange for the conduct of business. This is unacceptable geographic ethics,
which is not tolerated at Eaton. I&rsquo;ll give you an example. Several years ago we had a facility
that encountered piracy of our technology, theft of other intellectual property, and the sale of
our products into gray markets. Additionally, local businessmen made copycat versions of Ea-
ton products and threatened to label them with Eaton brand names unless we paid them not
to. The local government repeatedly approached us for payments, without which it would not
pursue or prosecute these matters. It became clear that we were not going to be able to do
business in an environment where the ethics of local officials were so different from our S

<p>Chapter 15 Purchasing Law and Ethics 577</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>own. So we abandoned the facility and our business in that country, at a not-insignificant
cost. I believe that operating under a single code of ethics not only strengthens our own orga-
nization, but also those organizations that do business with Eaton. When &lsquo;a rising tide lifts
all boats,&rsquo; the situation changes. Can one company change the world? No, but it can chart
its own ethical destiny.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;In conflict-of-interest situations, I think a company clearly controls its own destiny. Conflicts
of interest can arise in any aspect of business life and therefore present multiple opportu-
nities to choose the ethical course. China, for example, is a country where some people may
see conflict-of-interest issues differently than these matters are viewed in other countries.
We&rsquo;ve learned a lot about operating in that region and are very explicit about our expecta-
tions. Eaton had a plant manager in China, a Chinese national, who fell afoul of our prohibi-
tion against conflicts of interest. Although his actions may have been acceptable to some in
that country, they were not acceptable to Eaton. He replaced the supplier that was providing
a commodity to our plant with a supplier in which his wife had a financial interest. It was
quite clear that his decision had not been based on quality or price issues with the previous
supplier. Until then, we had been very pleased with this executive&rsquo;s performance. He was a
highly valued employee in whom we&rsquo;d invested considerable training, including almost four
years of cumulative operations experience in the United States and China. Despite our invest-
ment in this employee, we had to let him go. We simply could not allow this action to stand
or to appear to be endorsed when it was so clearly a violation of our conflict-of-interest
standards.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a supplier or business partner acts without integrity, we trust that our employees will
make it clear that if the unethical action does not stop, the business relationship will. We do
not take or use data that has been inappropriately or illegally procured. Yes, we care about re-
sults, but not at the expense of integrity.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Questions
1. Do you believe that Eaton is &ldquo;too tough&rdquo; in its emphasis on refusing to allow bribery, even
in countries where bribery is acceptable?
</p>
<p>2. &ldquo;When in Rome, why not do as the Romans do?&rdquo; Do you agree or disagree with this sen-
tence as it pertains to Eaton&rsquo;s policies in dealing with international governments?
</p>
<p>3. When individuals are found to act unethically, why doesn&rsquo;t Eaton give them a reprimand
and a second chance?

<p>CONCLUSION
The field of purchasing is dynamic and changing rapidly. When dealing with sup-
</p>
<p>pliers in contract negotiations, contract management, breach of contracts, potential
damages, and patent or trade secret disputes, purchasing managers must be sure to
stipulate the appropriate terms and conditions. Nevertheless, many legal disputes are
being handled through discussions with suppliers instead of being referred to legal de-
partments. Both purchasing managers and suppliers also generally prefer using negoti-
ation as an alternative to court decisions. In either case, purchasing managers must
be aware of the potential pitfalls implicit in standard legal terminology and must seek
to prevent the occurrence of such disputes. An operational rule of thumb is, when in
doubt, err on the side of prudence.

<p>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. Why is it important for purchasing managers to understand legal issues? Isn&rsquo;t
that what lawyers are for?
</p>
<p>2. What is the relationship among contract law, the UCC, and commercial law?
</p>
<p>3. What does the term &ldquo;agent&rdquo; mean? Under what conditions can purchasing agents
be held personally responsible for abusing their position?
</p>
<p>4. Suppose you arrive at a verbal agreement with someone on the price of purchas-
ing his or her vehicle. Under what conditions have you reached an enforceable
contract?
</p>
<p>5. Suppose you sign a contract with a supplier for $5,000 worth of steel castings.
You tell the supplier that you are only authorized to sign contracts for $4,000 with-
out approval from the comptroller of your company, but the supplier agrees any-
way. Later, you find out that you only need $2,500 worth of castings. How many
dollars worth of castings are you legally bound to purchase from the supplier?
</p>
<p>6. A seller verbally tells you that his cleaning product can remove any stain from
the surface of a vehicle. You later find out that this is not the case. In fact, you
find that the cleaning product does not work very well at all in removing paint
stains. Do you have a legal claim against this seller? What types of damages are
you entitled to?
</p>
<p>7. In the above case, the seller points to the fine print on the product, which states
that the product can only be used in temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
You were using it in temperatures of 35 degrees. Do you have a claim?
</p>
<p>8. What are the important items that should be used anytime you decide to enter
into a long-term contract (e.g., more than one year) with a supplier?
</p>
<p>9. Briefly, what is the Uniform Commercial Code? Is it enforceable in all U.S.
states?

<p>10. If you write a contract that contains specific language about transportation re-
quirements, and the supplier agrees to it but later claims that it is not acceptable
under the UCC, who in your opinion has the upper hand in this case?
</p>
<p>11. Suppose a supplier gives you a price on a contract and then later comes back and
claims that he mistakenly wrote down the wrong price. Do you have the right to
sue the supplier over breach of contract? What conditions are important here?
</p>
<p>12. Discuss the concept of ethics. Why is the purchasing profession particularly sensi-
tive to this topic?
</p>
<p>13. What are the different risks associated with unethical behavior?
</p>
<p>14. Discuss the reasons why some issues that confront a buyer are often not clear
from an ethical perspective.
</p>
<p>15. What is the purpose of a professional code of purchasing ethics?
</p>
<p>16. Why is it important for a firm to have a written ethics policy? What is the impor-
tance of top management&rsquo;s commitment to the policy?
</p>
<p>17. Discuss why you would be more interested in working for an organization that
supports environmentally friendly policies. Are there any negatives to working in
this type of organization?
</p>
<p>18. You are a supply manager for a major distributor; the CEO has strongly encour-
aged that you buy lighting products for the new municipal stadium from a sup-
plier that belongs to the CEO&rsquo;s country club. How would you handle this attempt
to influence you?

<p>Managing Hospital Pharmacy Inventory:
Cardinal Health&rsquo;s Race to the Bedside
</p>
<p>Hospitals are facing mandates from local and federal governments to reduce operating
costs, improve patient safety, reduce budgets, and cut Medicare reimbursements. One of the
major areas for targeting improvements is in pharmaceutical distribution and inventory,
which constitutes a major portion of hospitals&rsquo; budgets. Hospitals are now applying lean prin-
ciples to their inventory systems, in an effort to improve efficiency and reduce hospital operat-
ing costs. A number of hospitals, such as the Mayo Clinic, the University of San Diego
Hospital, University of California (both Davis and San Francisco), Seton Hospital, and Univer-
sity of North Carolina (Chapel Hill), have implemented medical dispensing technologies to im-
prove their pharmaceutical inventory systems. A recent study conducted by the Supply Chain
Resource Cooperative (scrc.ncsu.edu) suggests that hospitals engaging in these new medical
dispensing technologies will over a five-year period realize significant benefits that will con-
tribute to meeting these mandates.
</p>
<p>Although many hospitals have invested in automated pharmacy distribution technologies
(e.g., Pyxis Medstations) that automate the distribution, tracking, management, and security
of medications, there are several challenges associated with this approach, which include
management of inventory expenses, labor involved in refilling stations, station configuration,
stocking optimization, reducing stockouts, and most importantly, opportunities to reduce
hand-offs, which results in fewer medication errors. Cardinal Health is a major innovator in
development of hospital inventory management and replenishment systems, and several
years ago it introduced a replenishment system called Cardinal ASSIST. ASSIST is an auto-
mated replenishment system for Pyxis Medstation machines, with full functionality in generat-
ing reports to optimize inventory levels and minimize stockouts. ASSIST was conceived and
developed by hospital pharmacists, who sought a system to manage the size and frequency
of replenishments, and truly understood the needs of a hospital pharmacy. Hospital pharma-
cies that learn to exploit the full functionality of Cardinal ASSIST have seen improved pharma-
ceutical utilization (percentage of formulary going through the system) and have derived
significant benefits.
</p>
<p>Specifically, hospital pharmacies using Cardinal ASSIST at mature levels of implementation
realized the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Improved inventory turns from 8 (six weeks of stock on hand) to 24 (two weeks of
stock on hand)
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduced picking of medications from 600 per day to less than 80 per day
&bull; Reduced medication picking errors from 7.0 per day to less than 0.5 per day
&bull; Reduced stockouts from more than 200 per day to less than 30 per month
</p>
<p>These benefits have a significant impact on the total cost of patient care (TCPC).
</p>
<p>Total cost of patient care is a metric not often considered in discussions, but comprises the
hidden costs of mistakes that impact patient care. The elements that make up TCPC include
the following items:
</p>
<p>&bull; Lost nursing time
&bull; Technician productivity rates
&bull; Missed opportunities for pharmacist clinical intervention
&bull; Nursing turnover costs associated with dissatisfied nurses
&bull; Lengthened hospital stays as a result of slower healing rates attributed to
</p>
<p>missed doses and drug errors
&bull; Legal costs associated with settling claims for drug errors

<p>If U.S. companies learned anything over the last 10 years, it is that managing inven-
tory efficiently and effectively is central to remaining competitive. As shown in the
opening vignette, this also applies to diverse industries such as health care, not just
to manufacturing. Service companies, although they do not produce manufactured
products, nevertheless still have to manage significant amounts of inventory. For ex-
ample, the concluding Best Practice study in this chapter illustrates how a financial
services institution, Bank of America, invested significant resources to create a docu-
ment management system that not only reduced inventory, but created significant op-
erational efficiencies throughout its complex banking network.
</p>
<p>Although maintaining high levels of inventory was an accepted practice for many
years, it resulted in high carrying costs, reduced profit, and diminished market share.
Furthermore, high inventory levels often hid other problems such as poor material
quality, inaccurate demand-forecasting systems, and unreliable supplier delivery. To
avoid having to deal with these problems, it was often easier to increase safety stock
levels or increase the amount ordered from suppliers.
</p>
<p>When inventory moves so fast that firms essentially hold zero inventory on hand,
they are following a system known as the lean supply chain. John Shook defined lean
as &ldquo;a philosophy that seeks to shorten the time between the customer order and the
shipment to the customer by eliminating waste.&rdquo;1 Womack and Jones, in their book
Lean Thinking, argued that all activities associated with lean attempt to achieve three
objectives: flow, pull, and striving for excellence.2
</p>
<p>Flow means that inventory moves through the supply chain continuously with mini-
mal queuing or non-value-added activity being performed. Pull means that customer
orders start the work process, which ripples down through the supply chain. An up-
stream work center or operation will not create output unless a downstream center
directly requests (i.e., pulls) that output. The downstream center needs and then con-
sumes the output, leading to no inventory or waste. The third element, striving for
excellence, means that supply chains must have perfect quality. Anything less than
perfect quality leads to waste.
</p>
<p>The primary objective of this chapter is to provide an understanding of the impor-
tance of managing and controlling supply chain inventory in creating lean supply
chains. In the following sections, we present the types and costs of inventory, the
right and wrong reasons for maintaining inventory, and the close ties between the
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduced revenues from dissatisfied patients, or lost revenue from returning
patients
</p>
<p>&bull; Any other elements that negatively impact the rate at which patients become bet-
ter while in the facility
</p>
<p>Although there is a defined learning curve for pharmacists who introduce Cardinal ASSIST,
many of the pharmacists who have successfully deployed the system declare that they would
never return to a manual system. Systems such as Assist will be important stepping-stones
in the journey towards supply chain excellence in hospital pharmacy distribution.

<p>concept of the lean supply chain and the just-in-time (JIT) philosophy. We also pre-
sent powerful ways to manage inventory investment and discuss the concept of the
perfect customer order. The chapter concludes with a Good Practice Example of a fi-
nancial institution&rsquo;s implementation of lean supply chain management, as well as mul-
tiple examples of lean thinking from diverse industries and settings.
</p>
<p>Understanding Supply Chain Inventory
The best place to start our discussion of lean supply chains is to understand the ba-
</p>
<p>sic principles of inventory management. This section discusses the different types of
inventory, the costs associated with holding inventory, and the changing view of in-
ventory as a financial and operating liability rather than an asset.
</p>
<p>Types of Inventory
Inventory represents the largest single investment in assets for most manufacturers,
</p>
<p>wholesalers, and retailers. The five primary categories of inventory are (1) raw material
and semifinished item inventory; (2) work-in-process (WIP) inventory; (3) finished-
goods inventory; (4) maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) supplies inventory;
and (5) pipeline/in-transit inventory.
</p>
<p>Raw Material and Semifinished Item Inventory
This inventory includes the items purchased from suppliers or produced internally
</p>
<p>to directly support production requirements. Raw materials include those items pur-
chased in a bulk or unfinished condition. Bulk quantities of chemicals, resins, or petro-
leum are examples of purchased raw materials. Semifinished inventory includes those
items and components used as inputs during the final production process. Every pro-
ducer relies on some level of raw material or semifinished inventory to support final
production requirements. This type of inventory is managed primarily by purchasing,
a materials planning group, or supply chain managers.
</p>
<p>Work-in-Process Inventory
At any given point in time, work-in-process is the sum total of inventory within
</p>
<p>all processing centers. Work-in-process is incomplete&mdash;it has not yet been trans-
formed to a saleable finished good. This includes materials that are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Waiting to be moved to another process
</p>
<p>&bull; Currently being worked on at a work center
</p>
<p>&bull; Lining up at a processing center due to a capacity bottleneck or machine
breakdown
</p>
<p>If WIP increases over a certain level, this may indicate production bottlenecks or
delays. One study found that in most facilities, 36% of WIP inventory is in line wait-
ing for further work or processing. Another 27% is waiting on movement to another
work area or center, 4% is in the process of being moved, and only 24% is actually in
process.3 If WIP builds up at a workstation, a scheduler may have to reroute the flow
of material to another work center.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Finished-Goods Inventory
Finished-goods inventory includes completed items or products that are available
</p>
<p>for shipment or future customer orders. A firm that produces items in anticipation of
customer orders should monitor its finished-goods inventory closely. A higher-than-
anticipated level of finished goods may mean that a decrease in customer demand is
occurring. A lower-than-anticipated finished-goods inventory level may indicate that
customer demand is increasing. Either condition may also indicate that the forecasts
of anticipated customer demand do not match current output levels.
</p>
<p>When firms produce goods in anticipation of future customer orders, they are op-
erating in a make-to-stock environment. They expect to hold finished inventory in an-
ticipation of future demand. When firms produce goods in response to a customer
order, they are operating in a make-to-order environment. Just-in-time firms usually
operate in a make-to-order environment.
</p>
<p>Maintenance, Repair, and Operating Supplies Inventory
MRO inventory includes the items used to support production and operations.
</p>
<p>These items are not physically part of a finished product but are critical for the contin-
uous operation of plant, equipment, and offices. Examples of MRO inventory include
office supplies, spare parts, tools, and computers.
</p>
<p>Pipeline/In-Transit Inventory
This inventory is in transit to a customer or is located throughout distribution
</p>
<p>channels. Most consumable-goods inventory is either on trucks or on grocery store
shelves. In fact, grocery stores only provide a shelf for the product; they do not own
the inventory. The inventory is owned by the supplying company or distributor, which
receives payment when the consumer buys the product.
</p>
<p>Inventory-Related Costs
One of the drawbacks of holding excessive inventory is the effect this has on a
</p>
<p>firm&rsquo;s working capital. Working capital represents the funds committed to operating
a business, including the purchase and holding of inventory. Excessive inventory con-
sumes or ties up funds that a company could use more productively elsewhere. Order-
ing and carrying physical inventory involves a number of costs.
</p>
<p>Unit Costs
The most basic and the easiest inventory-related cost to quantify and track is unit
</p>
<p>cost. We can view the calculation of unit costs in several ways. First, each item or
good purchased from a supplier or another internal facility has a related unit cost,
which is the price a firm pays. Second, a finished product has a unit cost. The calcula-
tion of this cost may be more complex. Besides the direct material used to manufac-
ture the finished product, the product also has a labor cost and allocated overhead.
Cost accountants are largely responsible for identifying and assigning these costs.
</p>
<p>Ordering Costs
Ordering costs are a composite of the costs associated with the release of a material
</p>
<p>order. These costs may include the cost of generating and sending a material release,
transportation costs, and any other cost connected with acquiring a good. If a firm pro-
duces an item or good itself, the ordering cost may also include machine setup costs.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Carrying Costs
Carrying costs consist of three separate components: (1) cost of capital; (2) cost of
</p>
<p>storage; and (3) the costs of obsolescence, deterioration, and loss. The dollar amount in-
vested in physical inventory has an opportunity cost associated with it. Resources com-
mitted to inventory are not available for other economic uses. Therefore, committing
financial resources to holding physical inventory creates an inventory carrying cost.
</p>
<p>The physical storing of inventory creates costs, including any costs related to stor-
age space, insurance costs, or the cost to maintain the inventory (such as performing
cycle counts). Carrying costs vary with the level of inventory, which makes these
costs variable. Fixed costs are not included as part of carrying costs because inven-
tory levels typically have no effect on a fixed cost, at least in the short run.
</p>
<p>Holding inventory also increases the risk of theft, damage, spoilage, and obsoles-
cence. For example, obsolescence is a major issue in the computer industry, where inven-
tory loses about 1.5% of its functionality a week as a result of rapidly changing
technology, making the extended holding of any inventory financially risky.
</p>
<p>For most industries, inventory costs typically range from 15 to 25% of the value of
the inventory, depending on the company&rsquo;s cost of capital. As shown in Exhibit 16.1,
a variety of costs makes up the total carrying cost. The calculation of an inventory
carrying cost is as follows:
</p>
<p>Inventory Carrying Cost &frac14; Average Inventory in Units � Unit Price
� Carrying Cost per Year
</p>
<p>If a company averages 1,000 units in inventory, for which the unit price is $1.00
per unit, and the annual carrying cost is 25%, the total inventory carrying cost per
year for inventory is (1,000 &times; $1 &times; 0.25) = $250.
</p>
<p>Quality Costs
Quality costs include any cost associated with nonconforming items or goods. The
</p>
<p>total cost of inventory ownership is more than simply the unit, ordering, and carry-
ing costs. Quantifying the cost of poor quality can help identify the causes of prob-
lems. Examples of additional costs due to defective inventory include field failure
costs, rework, losses due to poor product yields, inspection, lost production, and war-
ranty costs.
</p>
<p>It is often difficult to quantify the total costs associated with ordering and carrying
physical inventory. Part of this results from the historical neglect of calculating total

<p>inventory costs along with a lack of systems capable of identifying inventory-related
costs. Most cost accounting systems are not capable of identifying and assigning the
true costs related to maintaining physical inventory. However, activity-based costing
accounting systems are increasingly able to quantify the distinct costs associated with
holding inventory. New types of enterprise resource planning systems also help man-
agers more accurately measure the actual level of inventory on hand, as opposed to
&ldquo;guesstimating.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Inventory Investment&mdash;Asset or Liability?
The opportunity to improve financial performance through effective inventory
</p>
<p>management practices is great and, at many firms, largely unrealized. For example,
many companies in historically high-margin industries (such as energy, utilities, and
pharmaceuticals) pay little attention to inventory, as it was always argued that the sav-
ings associated with inventory reduction outweighed the potential risk of a lost cus-
tomer sale. This view has begun to change, as the full impact of inventory on the
balance sheet and financial valuations on Wall Street reflect heightened awareness of
inventory turns as a key indicator of financial health.
</p>
<p>This has not always been the case. From the financial accounting perspective, inven-
tory has historically been considered a current asset (see Exhibit 16.2). When inventory
resides in the same category as cash and marketable securities, one cannot help but get
a feeling that there is actually something good associated with holding lots and lots of in-
ventory! For many years, this was precisely how most U.S. managers viewed this spe-
cial kind of asset. Only recently, financial analysts have begun to weigh in the impact
that the funds committed to inventory have on cash flow, working capital require-
ments, and profitability, and are making stock-buying recommendations based on this
factor. All of a sudden, senior leadership at firms are beginning to pay attention to this
number in their analyst calls!

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Any discussion of inventory management should focus on the need to translate
the impact that inventory management practices have on financial measures. A CEO
of an industrial company is not likely to get overly excited when he or she hears that
total inventory turns increased from seven to nine because of better inventory prac-
tices. Executive managers have not traditionally been concerned about the same set
of key performance indicators as the typical supply chain manager. However, in re-
cent years senior executives have begun to appreciate the importance of effective in-
ventory management, once the relationship between the impact of increased turns on
financial indicators has been elevated by Wall Street analysts.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 16.3 illustrates one way to translate the impact that improved inventory
turns (which is the visible outcome of inventory management practices) has on an im-
portant performance indicator, return on investment. The two firms in this exhibit
are identical in every way but two&mdash;Firm B has half the amount of inventory on its
balance sheet as Firm A, and Firm B has a slightly higher profit margin than Firm A.
It is reasonable to assume that Firm B will have a higher profit margin due to lower
average carrying charges resulting from shorter periods of storage with less handling
and reduced inventory maintenance requirements. Margins should also improve due
to the elimination of non-value-adding activities.
</p>
<p>This exhibit shows how better inventory management can affect return on invest-
ment. A doubling of inventory turns, combined with the benefit of lower inventory-
related expenses that contribute to a higher profit margin, increases return on invest-
ment from 9.36% to 11.55%, an increase of almost 25%.
</p>
<p>Identifying the impact of inventory management activities on return on invest-
ment is not the only way to demonstrate the value of such efforts. Supply chain and fi-

<p>Amazon Slashes Its Supply
Chain Inventory Levels
</p>
<p>When they first started appearing in the late 1990s, web-based &ldquo;e-tailers&rdquo; such as
Amazon.com hoped to replace the &ldquo;bricks&rdquo; of traditional retailing with the &ldquo;clicks&rdquo; of online
ordering via computer keyboards. Rather than opening dozens or even hundreds of stores
filled with expensive inventory, an e-tailer runs a single virtual store that serves customers
around the globe. The e-tailer business model suggested that inventory could be kept at a
few key sites chosen to minimize costs and facilitate quick delivery to customers. In theory,
e-tailers were highly scalable businesses that could add new customers with little or no addi-
tional investment in inventory or facilities. (Traditional retailers usually need to add stores to
gain significant increases in their customer base.)
</p>
<p>But how has this actually played out for Amazon.com? Exhibit 16.4 contains sales and inven-
tory figures for Amazon.com for the years 1997 through 2006. The first column reports net
sales for each calendar year, whereas the second column contains the amount of inventory
on hand at the end of the year. The third column shows inventory turns, which is calculated
as (Net Sales/Ending Inventory). Retailers generally want higher inventory turns, indicating
that they can support the same level of sales with less inventory.
</p>
<p>Graphing these results provides some interesting insights. Consider Exhibit 16.5. In late 1999,
Amazon.com learned that managing inventory can be a challenge even for e-tailers. That was
the year the company expanded into new product lines, such as electronics and housewares,
with which it had little experience. Amazon.com&rsquo;s purchasing managers were faced with the
question of how many of these items to hold in inventory&mdash;too little, and they risked losing or-
ders and alienating customers; too much, and they could lock up the company&rsquo;s resources in un-
sold products. Only later, when sales for the 1999 holiday season fell flat and Amazon.com&rsquo;s
inventory levels skyrocketed, did they realize they had overstocked. In fact, as the figures show,

<p>The Right Reasons for Investing in Inventory
Physical inventory plays an important role in all supply chains. Without inventory
</p>
<p>companies cannot build products, provide customer service, or run their operations.
When deciding whether to maintain an investment in inventory, a broad premise to
follow is that inventory should be held only when the benefit of holding inventory ex-
ceeds the cost of holding inventory. The following section examines the proper rea-
sons for carrying inventory.
</p>
<p>Avoid Disruptions in Operational Performance
A major reason for maintaining an investment in inventory is to support produc-
</p>
<p>tion requirements and avoid any type of supply disruptions. Even in an era of just-
in-time production, almost all firms hold some level of preproduction inventory,
which may include bulk supplies of raw materials, semifinished goods, or materials
to support the packaging and shipping of finished products.

<p>by the end of 1999, Amazon.com&rsquo;s inventory turnover ratio was 7.4&mdash;worse than that of the typi-
cal bricks-and-mortar retailer.
</p>
<p>After 1999, Amazon seemed to learn its lesson. Inventory turns rose to nearly 22 in 2001, but
have fallen steadily ever since, to 12.2 turns for 2006. Still, these results are better than the
more typical bricks-and-mortar retailers. As a comparison, in 2006, Wal-Mart&rsquo;s consolidated
operations generated just 9.7 turns.

<p>Production inventory consumes a major portion of inventory investment. For this
reason, firms emphasize the development of systems designed to control and reduce
the amount of production-related inventory maintained at any given time. The reduc-
tion of production (particularly work-in-process) inventory results in reduced inven-
tory costs. Although the need to support production requirements will always remain
as a primary reason to hold physical inventory, it is not a reason to hold excessive in-
ventory. Supply managers need to strike a delicate balance between avoiding any sup-
ply disruptions and holding excessive amounts of inventory that weigh down a firm&rsquo;s
or business unit&rsquo;s balance sheet.
</p>
<p>Support Operational Requirements
Nearly every organization carries MRO inventory&mdash;maintenance, repair, and oper-
</p>
<p>ating supplies&mdash;to support operations. The true cost of MRO inventory often goes un-
noticed because firms fail to track these items with the same intensity as production
inventory. Multiple or obsolete items may be held in stock, and inventory pilferage
can further lead to inventory-shrinking losses if proper tracking systems are not
established.
</p>
<p>Most firms are trying to control the costs associated with ordering and maintain-
ing MRO items. Some of the techniques used to control MRO costs include the use
of a central MRO stores location, online requisitioning systems, and full-service dis-
tributors. These distributors are responsible for managing the entire supply and de-
mand for MRO inventory items and may charge an additional fee for their services.
</p>
<p>Support Customer Service Requirements
Many products, such as computers, appliances, and automobiles, require service
</p>
<p>or replacement parts. A lack of adequate spare parts inventory increases the risk of
not meeting customer service requirements. To avoid this possibility, companies of-
ten maintain a significant inventory of service and replacement parts.
</p>
<p>Service and replacement parts can be a major source of inventory waste or cus-
tomer dissatisfaction if incorrect inventory levels are maintained. Accurate parts fore-
casts and material control systems are critical for maintaining proper inventory levels
for service and replacement parts.
</p>
<p>Hedge against Marketplace Uncertainty
Supply chains are sensitive to changes in markets, including changes in the availabil-
</p>
<p>ity of material supply as well as price changes. When purchasers anticipate materials
shortages or price increases, they often increase purchase quantities as a hedge against
these uncertainties. Material hedging is a common response, for example, when a strike
by a supplier appears likely. Another reason to hedge occurs when potential shortages
in common commodities (e.g., lumber) appear imminent, with the knowledge that price
increases are likely. In these situations, purchasers will carry out forward buys by order-
ing larger-than-normal quantities.
</p>
<p>Increasing inventory levels in response to a legitimate threat of a shortage can be
a good reason, at least in the short run, for holding additional material. One of the pri-
mary objectives of purchasing and supply chain management is to support continued
and uninterrupted operations. If this requires increased inventory to avoid a materials
shortage, then a purchaser should consider such an action, assuming that additional

<p>Managing Inventory
in a Volatile Market
</p>
<p>For anyone wanting to make a cleaner car or sport-utility vehicle, a little-known metal
called palladium is a must. Unfortunately, the main exporter of palladium is Russia, which
has created chaos on the market by holding up deliveries, including delaying releasing the
metal from its huge stockpile. At one point, concerns that political infighting in Moscow
could choke supplies drove the price of palladium to nearly $1,000 an ounce, or about 10
times the levels seen in the early 1990s. Although there is less than an ounce of palladium
in most vehicles&mdash;it is used inside the catalytic converter&mdash;that kind of price surge means
palladium suddenly is becoming a big-ticket inventory item for auto companies.
</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, automakers agreed to accelerate their adoption of tighter national emis-
sion standards as part of a deal to head off separate state-by-state rules, which would have
played havoc with manufacturing and distribution. Palladium looked like the best solution, be-
cause it began cleaning exhaust sooner after starting up the engine than platinum, then the
dominant metal in catalytic converters. The price for little-used palladium had not gone
above $200 an ounce in more than a decade, whereas platinum had jumped above $400. En-
gineers designed palladium into the emission control system. In the process, they created a
tremendous amount of demand for a metal having a volatile supply.
</p>
<p>Economics dictates that producers should boost output to bring the palladium market into
balance in this kind of situation. However, geology makes palladium special. In nature, it oc-
curs mostly with other metals, nickel in Russia and platinum in South Africa, and in both
places there is much less palladium per ton of ore than the other metals. Even if palladium
prices take off, big producers will not add to output, because that would mean flooding the
nickel and platinum markets.
</p>
<p>Purchasers responded to the palladium crisis in different ways. General Motors signed a
five-year supply deal with the only major palladium producer outside of Russia and South
Africa, Stillwater Mining Company in Montana. Ford&rsquo;s purchasing group, on the other hand, se-
cured its supply of palladium by entering into contracts that locked in prices at near-record
highs. As the demand for palladium declined due to engineering changes that reduced the
amount of palladium required in each vehicle, Ford found itself with massive quantities of
overpriced palladium. In 2002, Ford shocked Wall Street by announcing a $1 billion write-off
of the value of its palladium stockpile. Ford discovered that managing inventory in a volatile
market is a tricky business!

<p>time most companies felt these discounts were worthwhile because they resulted in a
lower average price. However, a lower purchase price does not necessarily translate into
a lower total cost. Lower total costs result only if the benefit from reduced ordering
costs (larger purchase quantities means ordering less frequently) and a lower per-unit
price outweigh the cost of holding additional inventory. It sometimes makes economic
sense from a total cost perspective to take advantage of the quantity discounts offered
by suppliers and to hold larger amounts of inventory.
</p>
<p>Each of the reasons presented here can result in holding some level of physical in-
ventory. Regardless of the reason for holding inventory, supply chain managers must
be aware of total inventory costs. The key is to minimize inventory investment wher-
ever possible while still meeting competitive and customer requirements.
</p>
<p>The Wrong Reasons for Investing in Inventory
Any discussion of inventory must differentiate between the good and bad reasons
</p>
<p>for carrying inventory. Unnecessary inventory usually results from one thing: uncer-
tainty. Uncertainty results in not being able to adequately plan inventory require-
ments because of supply chain variability. It may be the consequence of variability in
forecasting accuracy or inconsistent logistics, which usually results in greater amounts
of safety stock. The following discussion considers the bad reasons for maintaining
an investment in inventory. Some of the ideas presented in the later section titled &ldquo;Ap-
proaches for Managing Inventory Investment&rdquo; address these bad reasons directly.
</p>
<p>Poor Quality and Material Yield
Poor quality and material yield have historically been major sources of unneces-
</p>
<p>sary inventory investment. Unfortunately, it is easier to increase a material release by
10% or carry safety stock to cover supplier quality problems than to correct a prob-
lem&rsquo;s root cause. It became a routine practice for many companies to order more
than required to cover expected supplier inconsistency. A certain level of material de-
fects was an accepted part of the transaction.
</p>
<p>Variable material yield also may also contribute to unnecessary levels of inventory.
Material yield is a term typically associated with raw materials. A purchaser who spec-
ifies a raw material at a particular grade expects to receive a shipment conforming to
that specification. Poor quality affects material yields when a portion of the shipment
is a lower grade or quality than what was specified, therefore providing less output
than expected. When this happens, purchasers must often increase their purchase
quantity to guarantee that their receipt yields the proper amount of usable material.
This increase in inventory provides nothing of value in return.
</p>
<p>Unreliable Supplier Delivery
Suppliers that cannot meet delivery schedules create delivery uncertainty. To com-
</p>
<p>pensate for unreliable delivery, supply chain managers usually increase safety stock
levels or make ordering lead times longer. Delivery uncertainty is often the result of
poor supplier scheduling or production systems and can be a problem when buying
from small suppliers that do not have the resources or experience to develop sophisti-
cated scheduling systems. It can also be the result of discrepancies and logistics

<p>problems. Missed shipments, delays at international customs points, bad weather,
and many other unexpected problems can result in late deliveries.
</p>
<p>Purchasers must also accept part of the blame for delivery uncertainty. Suppliers
value a stable production schedule with reasonable production lead times. A pur-
chaser who provides suppliers with short notice or requests frequent changes to a
schedule increases the probability of delivery uncertainty. A major step toward elimi-
nating delivery uncertainty is a commitment to stable release schedules with realistic
(but not overly generous) supplier lead times.
</p>
<p>Extended Order-Cycle Times from Global Sourcing
A major business objective today is to reduce the total time between the recognition
</p>
<p>of a purchase requirement and the physical receipt of material from a supplier&mdash;that is,
the order-cycle time between purchaser and seller. As order-cycle times lengthen as a re-
sult of the extension of supply chains due to global sourcing agreements (which may
require six-month lead times), a common practice has been to carry a higher level of
inventory to compensate for greater uncertainty. The ability to plan material require-
ments accurately decreases as order-cycle time lengthens. Much more can happen to
disrupt plans over a three-month ordering cycle than over a two-week ordering cycle.
</p>
<p>Inaccurate or Uncertain Demand Forecasts
Inaccurate or uncertain demand forecasts are a common source of uncertainty affect-
</p>
<p>ing inventory levels, particularly for companies that produce products in anticipation of
future orders. Companies often use increased safety stock levels to compensate for de-
mand uncertainty or inaccurate forecasts. Some firms simply have poor forecasting
systems.
</p>
<p>Consider the case of an East Coast confectioner that forecasts monthly in a make-
to-stock environment. The supply chain group at this company recently analyzed fin-
ished product forecasting error in its efforts to manage inventory investment more ef-
fectively.4 The company found that its stock-keeping units (SKUs) had an average
error of 45% when comparing actual and predicted monthly demand using the mean
absolute deviation technique of error assessment. A closer investigation revealed
some disturbing findings. Material planners believed that a four-week safety stock for
all items would alleviate the impact of poor forecasting, thereby reducing the need to
be concerned with forecast accuracy. Furthermore, no single manager or group was ac-
countable for forecast integrity. Marketing, which technically had responsibility for
generating monthly forecasts, admitted that forecasting was a &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; and not the
best use of their members&rsquo; time. Finally, an analysis across the company&rsquo;s 900 SKUs
found that inventory was sometimes severely misallocated across geographic locations
and product lines, creating problems in meeting the delivery dates for key customer or-
ders. As a result, this company has created a cross-functional sales and operations
planning group to address product forecasting and finished-goods distribution.
</p>
<p>Companies should periodically evaluate the accuracy of their forecasting systems
by comparing forecasted demand to actual requirements. Forecasting systems should
have a goal of minimizing the difference between a forecasted requirement and an ac-
tual requirement to avoid having to carry higher inventory levels as protection.

<p>Specifying Custom Items for Standard Applications
Specifying custom items for standard applications is an area of debate between
</p>
<p>purchasing and engineering. Purchasers would like to buy industry-standard parts wher-
ever possible while still meeting engineering&rsquo;s quality and design requirements. Specify-
ing customized parts when standardized parts are available adversely affects material
inventory because customized parts are usually more expensive. A supplier usually
designs and creates specific tooling for each customized item. In addition, a supplier
usually produces smaller batches of the item because of its custom specification. The
smaller batches result in an increased piece-part cost. Customized parts, because of
higher design and production costs, increase total unit and inventory-carrying costs.
</p>
<p>Extended Material Pipelines
Long distances between supply chain members can result in higher inventory levels
</p>
<p>and costs. Distance increases delivery uncertainty, often for reasons outside the control
of a supplier or buyer. Overseas shipments can experience a variety of delays at cus-
toms. Longer shipping distances also increase the potential for in-transit shipping dam-
age, theft, or obsolescence. Furthermore, someone in the supply chain (the supplier,
purchaser, or end customer) owns the inventory as it travels over great distances. This
increases the risk and exposure to financial loss, if the inventory is damaged, is stolen,
or simply disappears into one of the many &ldquo;black holes&rdquo; that exist in the global supply
chains at distribution points, ports, shipping terminals, railway nodes, and other loca-
tions. Extended material pipelines are a major consideration when comparing the cost
of domestic versus international purchasing. Many firms fail to consider the higher cost
of inventory when they outsource their supply chain to Asia and do not take into ac-
count the impact of longer planning times, inventory obsolescence, and slower cus-
tomer response associated with long global supply lead times. There are, of course,
some exceptions to this rule, as the Sourcing Snapshot: In Year of Disasters, Lean Emer-
gency Materials Management Brings Order to the Chaos of Relief Operations suggests,

<p>Inefficient Manufacturing Processes
A producer whose manufacturing system is not efficient must hold higher-than-
</p>
<p>necessary inventory levels to compensate for poor quality or process yield. One indication
of an inefficient scheduling or production system is a large amount of work-in-process in-
ventory located behind each work center. Inefficient scheduling and productions often
</p>
<p>10 days. &ldquo;They would kick them out the door at landing strips,&rdquo; says U.S. Air Force Colonel
Richard Walberg, the officer in charge at the Islamabad base. &ldquo;That was quite a system.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The bags are one product of an unusual effort by the global cargo industry to try to trans-
form the notoriously inefficient supply chain for disaster relief. A loose-knit collection of com-
panies and executives is seeking to help governments and private aid groups respond more
effectively to major disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes.
</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re applying to emergency-supply chains the nuts-and-bolts inventory management and lo-
gistics techniques that helped revolutionize their industry and helped make global giants like
Dell and Wal-Mart successful.
</p>
<p>Shipping companies like DHL, UPS, and FedEx are experts in integrating technology with an
almost militaristic level of organization to squeeze inefficiencies out of supply chains&mdash;and
better manage inventory in these channels. Most of the industry&rsquo;s expertise is in somewhat
mundane areas like parcel tracking, inventory control, jet routing, and cramming lots of mate-
rial into small spaces. Many improvements are marginal, but the cumulative result is dra-
matic: the ability to move huge loads across the globe with new speed and precision.
</p>
<p>In a year of unprecedented calamities, that expertise is now in high demand. &ldquo;The most impor-
tant thing in a sudden disaster is logistics,&rdquo; says Adrian van der Knapp, who coordinates
emergency-relief operations for the United Nations and helps DHL get quick government autho-
rization to go into disaster zones. Aid groups and the U.N. are often deluged with donated sup-
plies but struggle to get them where they&rsquo;re needed, he adds. &ldquo;There is no U.N. fire brigade
or standby army that can be called upon in natural disasters.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Enter Weeks, who in Kashmir was responding to his third major disaster since January. The
48-year-old Briton, who is based at DHL&rsquo;s vast hub in Brussels, went to Kashmir within days
of his return home from a U.S. Air Force base near Little Rock, Arkansas. There, he had been
helping deliver foreign aid to victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Before that, his team of
about 35 veteran airport-cargo handlers took charge of aid operations for overwhelmed Sri
Lankan authorities at Colombo Airport after the Indian Ocean tsunami. &ldquo;We were not ready to
receive all these flights,&rdquo; says Ari Hewage, the Sri Lankan Secretary to the Ports and Aviation
Minister, who nervously gave the corporate experts the go-ahead to take over.
</p>
<p>The effort to bring modern shipping methods to disaster relief is largely the inspiration of a
San Francisco cargo tycoon named Lynn Fritz. He sold his own company, Fritz Cos., to United
Parcel Service Inc. in 2001, banked some $200 million, and started looking for a philan-
thropic enterprise. He soon became an evangelist for applying logistics techniques to the deliv-
ery of disaster relief, eventually founding the Fritz Institute, a nonprofit devoted to the cause.
&ldquo;I did not just want to be a philanthropist that gave to local charities,&rdquo; Fritz says. &ldquo;The sup-
ply chain for the humanitarian emergency is highly unpredictable. . . . We thought we could
apply these skills with the help of the private sector.&rdquo;

<p>Most inventory waste results from underlying problems that management has

ciencies as part of conducting business. Failure to correct these underlying problems
makes the inefficient producer vulnerable to challenges from cost-efficient producers.
Whereas balance sheet accounting presents inventory as an asset, experienced supply
chain managers recognize it is an asset worth controlling and, when necessary, even
eliminating.
</p>
<p>Creating the Lean Supply Chain5
Lean supply chains have their origin in the just-in-time philosophy, first adopted
</p>
<p>by many American and European firms in the late 1980s. As the following definition
suggests, JIT touches on many of the areas we have dealt with throughout this book.
</p>
<p>Just-in-Time (JIT) is a philosophy of manufacturing based on planned elim-
ination of all waste and on continuous improvement of productivity. It en-
compasses the successful execution of all operations activities required to
produce a final product, from design engineering to delivery, and includes
all stages of conversion from raw material onward. The primary elements
of Just-in-Time are to have only the required inventory when needed; to im-
prove quality to zero defects; to reduce lead times by reducing setup times,
queue lengths, and lot sizes; to incrementally revise the operations them-
selves; and to accomplish these activities at minimum cost. In the broad
sense, it applies to all forms of production&mdash;job shop, process, and repetitive&mdash;
and to many service industries as well.
</p>
<p>Firms following the JIT philosophy often experience remarkable improvements in
their productivity (outputs/inputs), inventory levels, and quality. To understand why
JIT made such an impact in the late 1980s, consider some eye-opening statistics from
1986, which compared performance at Toyota&rsquo;s Takaoka facility with that of GM&rsquo;s
Framingham plant (Exhibit 16.6). Numbers such as these kicked off the JIT revolu-
tion in the American automotive industry during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</p>
<p>Notice how the Toyota plant needed fewer hours and much less inventory to do
its job. This ability to do more with less led many people to refer to JIT as lean pro-
duction. Similarly, the phrase &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; reflected the idea that the timing and
level of inventory and production activities are closely matched to demand. With aver-
age inventory levels of only two hours, the Toyota plant was clearly &ldquo;just&rdquo; receiving
parts and materials before they were needed.
</p>
<p>The underlying emphases of JIT&mdash;to eliminate all forms of uncertainty and waste&mdash;
are relevant to all organizations, regardless of the specific planning and control tools
that are used. Second, even though some techniques such as kanban are not suitable in
certain production and service environments, it is entirely possible that an organization
can follow the JIT philosophy. To summarize:S

<p>&bull; The JIT philosophy can be applied to a wide range of production and ser-
vice environments. In fact, one could easily argue that there is no environ-
ment that wouldn&rsquo;t benefit from adopting its core principles.
</p>
<p>&bull; Companies following the JIT philosophy can and do use a wide range of
planning and control techniques, not just kanban.
</p>
<p>&bull; JIT is closely aligned with total quality management and supplier manage-
ment initiatives.
</p>
<p>With this background, let&rsquo;s look at the historical roots of JIT, the various forms of
waste and uncertainty, the special role of inventory in a JIT environment, and the
three core elements of lean supply chains: JIT purchasing, JIT transportation, and JIT
kanban systems.
</p>
<p>The JIT Perspective on Waste
A key component of the JIT philosophy is a never-ending effort to eliminate
</p>
<p>waste, which is defined as &ldquo;any activity that does not add value to the good or service
in the eyes of the consumer.&rdquo;7 Starting with Taiichi Ohno, a Toyota engineer, experts
have sought to identify the major sources of waste (or &ldquo;muda,&rdquo; in Japanese). The fol-
lowing eight sources are commonly recognized:8
</p>
<p>1. Overproduction&mdash;caused by inflexible or unreliable processes that cause orga-
nizations to produce goods before they are required.
</p>
<p>2. Waiting&mdash;caused by inefficient layouts or an inability to match demand with
output levels.
</p>
<p>3. Unnecessary transportation&mdash;transporting goods always increases costs and
the risk of damage, but it does not necessarily provide value to the final
customer.
</p>
<p>4. Inappropriate process&mdash;using overly complex processes, when simpler, more
efficient ones would do.
</p>
<p>5. Unnecessary inventory&mdash;caused by uncertainty with regard to quality levels,
delivery lead times, and the like.
</p>
<p>6. Unnecessary/excess motion&mdash;caused by poorly designed processes.
</p>
<p>7. Defects&mdash;not only do defects create uncertainty in the process, they rob pro-
duction capacity by creating products or services that require rework or must
be scrapped.
</p>
<p>8. Underutilization of employees&mdash;the newest form of waste added to the list.
This form of waste recognizes that too often, companies often do not fully uti-
lize the skill and decision-making capability of their employees.
</p>
<p>To put these forms of waste in context, suppose it takes an inspector at a manufac-
turing plant 15 minutes to inspect an incoming batch of material. The traditional

<p>perspective would be that inspections like these are a necessary and prudent business ex-
pense. But according to JIT, this is a waste of both time and personnel caused by de-
fects. Services examples abound as well. If you have to wait even five minutes at the
doctor&rsquo;s office before being seen, then waste has occurred. If this definition seems
harsh, it is meant to be. The point is to get organizations thinking critically about the
business processes they use to provide products and services, as well as the outcomes of
these processes. As far as JIT is concerned, if there is any waste at all, there is room for
improvement.
</p>
<p>The JIT Perspective on Inventory
One hallmark of a JIT environment is the strong emphasis placed on reducing
</p>
<p>raw material, work-in-process, and finished goods inventories throughout the system.
This is because inventory is not only seen as a form of waste in and of itself, but also
because inventory can cover up wasteful business practices. Under the JIT philoso-
phy, lowering inventory levels forces firms to address these poor practices.
</p>
<p>To illustrate how inventory can hide problems, consider a simple facility consist-
ing of three work centers (A, B, and C), shown in Exhibit 16.7.
</p>
<p>The triangles in the diagram represent inventory. In addition, between each work
center is plenty of room for inventory. Take one of the work centers, say Center B,
and consider what happens if it has an equipment breakdown that reduces its out-
put. The answer is, in the short run, only Center B is affected. Because there is plenty
of space for inventory between A and B, then Center A can continue to work. And be-
cause inventory exists between Center B and C, Center C can continue to work as
long as the inventory lasts. Most importantly, the customer can continue to be
served. The same result occurs regardless of the reason for any disruption in Center
B, including worker absenteeism, poor quality levels, and so forth. Whatever the prob-
lem, inventory hides it (but at a cost).
</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take the same facility after a successful JIT program has been put in
place. The work centers have been moved closer together, eliminating wasted move-
ment and space where inventory could pile up. Setup times have also been reduced, al-
lowing the work centers to make only what is needed when it is needed. If we
assume the program has been in place for a while, we can also assume that the

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>inventory levels have been reduced dramatically, giving us a revised picture of the fa-
cility (see Exhibit 16.8).
</p>
<p>Now, inventory has been reduced to the point where it shows up only in the cus-
tomer facility. Under these conditions, what happens in the short run if the equip-
ment at Center B breaks down? The answer this time is that everything stops,
including shipments to the customer. Center A has to stop because there is no spot
for it to put inventory, nor is there any demand for it. Center C has to stop because
there is no inventory on which to work.
</p>
<p>Inventory in the supply chain is often compared to water in a river. If the &ldquo;water&rdquo;
is high enough, it will cover all the &ldquo;rocks&rdquo; (quality problems, absenteeism, equip-
ment breakdowns, etc.), and everything will appear to be running smoothly.
</p>
<p>Under JIT, the approach is to gradually remove the &ldquo;water&rdquo; until the first &ldquo;rock&rdquo; is
exposed, thereby establishing a priority as to the most important obstacle to work on.
After resolving this problem, inventory levels are reduced further until another prob-
lem (and opportunity to eliminate waste) appears. This process continues indefinitely,
or until all forms of waste and uncertainty have been eliminated (see Exhibit 16.9).
</p>
<p>This is not an easy approach to implement. The implication is that every time a
process is working smoothly, there may be too much inventory and more should be
removed until the organization hits another &ldquo;rock.&rdquo; That is certainly not a natural

<p>action for most people, and the performance evaluation system needs to be altered to
reflect this type of activity.
</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s examine three of the primary elements of a lean supply chain: (1) just-in-
time purchasing, (2) just-in-time transportation, and (3) just-in-time kanban systems.
</p>
<p>Just-in-Time Purchasing
Implementing a just-in-time purchasing system is the first major element of a lean
</p>
<p>supply chain. A JIT purchasing system receives frequent receipts of material from sup-
pliers to meet immediate requirements. The following features define a JIT purchas-
ing system:
</p>
<p>&bull; A commitment to zero defects by the buyer and seller
</p>
<p>&bull; Frequent shipment of small lot sizes according to strict quality and delivery
performance standards
</p>
<p>&bull; Closer, even collaborative, buyer-seller relationships
</p>
<p>&bull; Stable production schedules sent to suppliers on a regular basis
</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive sharing of electronic information between supply chain members
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic data interchange capability with suppliers
</p>
<p>Not simply a series of techniques, a JIT purchasing system is an operating philoso-
phy that does not tolerate high inventory levels, less-than-perfect quality, or other
inefficiency and waste between buyer and seller. JIT purchasing also requires perma-
nent changes in how a firm conducts business. It is not a one-time effort or a project
but rather a continuous improvement process. A true JIT purchasing system requires
cultural and personnel mind-set changes on the part of the purchaser and the suppli-
ers. Perhaps most important, JIT purchasing does not mean pushing inventory back
to the supplier. JIT purchasing requires cooperation, coordination, and information
sharing to eliminate inventory across the supply chain.
</p>
<p>JIT Purchasing Barriers
JIT purchasing between Western companies has been slowed or even prohibited
</p>
<p>by a variety of barriers that are part of the Western business system and culture, al-
though industries are affected differently. Fortunately, some of these barriers are not
as great as they were when JIT first became popular during the early and mid-1980s.
Important barriers include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Dispersed supply base. Most purchasers have a geographically dispersed sup-
ply base. Because JIT relies on frequent deliveries of smaller quantities from
suppliers, it may be difficult to achieve a level of consistent delivery reliabil-
ity from suppliers located 800 or even 8,000 miles away. The greater the dis-
tance between buyer and seller, the greater the variability around delivery
times.
</p>
<p>&bull; Historic buyer-seller relationships. Buyers and sellers often lack the cooperative
relationship required to pursue JIT purchasing. A true JIT system requires mu-
tual trust and respect between parties. Historically, the relationship between
U.S. buyers and sellers has been closer to adversarial than cooperative.
</p>
<p>&bull; Number of suppliers. Some supply chains still have too many suppliers to
support an efficient JIT system. Like other progressive purchasing strategies,
JIT requires a drastically reduced supply base to minimize interaction and

<p>communication costs. It is nearly impossible to develop closer relationships
with thousands of suppliers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier quality performance. Some sellers simply have not achieved the lev-
els of near-perfect quality required for JIT purchasing. A total commitment
to product and delivery quality is a prerequisite for a successful JIT system.
</p>
<p>The barriers limiting the increased use of JIT purchasing are beginning to break
down. A reduction in the number of suppliers is the most obvious change. JIT purchas-
ing has clearly been a major factor behind the supply-base reduction effort of most
U.S. companies. Another change includes buyers and sellers developing closer working
relationships. The two parties are increasingly willing to share information such as pro-
duction scheduling and product development plans. Information sharing has contrib-
uted to the greater use of electronic systems linking supply chain members.
</p>
<p>Just-in-Time Transportation
JIT transportation, the second element of a lean supply chain, refers to the efficient
</p>
<p>movement of goods between the buyer and seller. This involves frequent deliveries of
smaller quantities directly to the point of use at the purchaser. A lean transportation
network relies on company-owned or contracted vehicles that pick up and deliver ac-
cording to a regular and repeatable schedule. This repeatable schedule, also called a
closed-loop system, moves goods from supplier to purchaser and then from purchaser
back to supplier with return material, such as containers. Long-term dedicated contract
carriage replaces commercial carriage as the primary mode of transportation in a
closed-loop transportation system.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 16.10 on p. 606 compares a traditional delivery system with a just-in-time
delivery system. In a traditional system, the supplier and purchaser do not coordinate
their material requirements or production schedules. Suppliers produce material and
then store that material, awaiting an order from the purchaser. In a JIT system, suppli-
ers coordinate production schedules with customer schedules. Production moves
from the supplier&rsquo;s work center to the carrier and directly to the purchaser. Design-
ing a JIT transportation network involves certain steps:
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduce the number of carriers. Reduce the number of carriers, perhaps even
to one per region.
</p>
<p>&bull; Use longer-term contracts. Negotiate longer-term agreements with carriers
that formalize the dedicated transportation network.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish electric linkages. Establish electronic/satellite linkages with suppliers
and carriers to coordinate and control the movement of material through
the network.
</p>
<p>&bull; Implement a closed-loop system. Pick up all freight from suppliers and deliver
on a regular schedule. Use returnable containers to eliminate waste.
</p>
<p>&bull; Efficiently handle material. Use state-of-the-art material-handling equipment
and technology. JIT transportation systems feature certain innovations that
can further eliminate supply chain waste. The first includes specialized trans-
portation vehicles that allow easy loading and unloading of smaller quanti-
ties. These trucks are smaller, more efficient, and more versatile. The second
innovation includes the extensive use of returnable plastic or steel contain-
ers. As drivers pick up material from suppliers, they leave empty containers
for reuse. A third innovation involves point-of-use doors at production

<p>facilities. Because excessive material handling and travel within a facility is
wasteful, deliveries occur close to where the material is needed.
</p>
<p>Just-in-Time Kanban Systems
Developed along with the JIT movement, a kanban system is a production control
</p>
<p>approach that uses containers, cards, or visual cues to control the production and
movement of goods through the supply chain. These systems have several key char-
acteristics:
</p>
<p>1. Kanban systems use simple signaling mechanisms such as a card, or even an
empty space or container, to indicate when specific items should be produced
or moved. Most kanban systems, in fact, do not require computerization.
</p>
<p>2. Kanban systems can be used to synchronize activities either within a plant or
between different supply chain partners. As such, a kanban system can be an
important part of both production activity control and supplier order manage-
ment systems.

<p>3. Kanban systems are not planning tools. Rather, they are control mechanisms
that are designed to pull parts or goods through the supply chain based on
downstream demand. As a result, many firms use techniques such as material
requirements planning (MRP) to anticipate requirements, but depend on their
kanban systems to control the actual execution of production and movement
activities.
</p>
<p>As we noted before, cards aren&rsquo;t the only signaling method used in a kanban sys-
tem. Some other methods include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Single-card systems. The single card is the production card, and the empty
container serves as the move signal.
</p>
<p>&bull; Color coding of containers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Designated storage spaces.
</p>
<p>&bull; Computerized bar coding systems.
</p>
<p>Approaches for Managing Inventory Investment
The effective management of inventory investment should be a primary objective
</p>
<p>when searching for ways to manage costs, improve profitability, and enhance share-
holder value. How managers view inventory can differ depending on where one re-
sides in the supply chain. Although financial planners view inventory in terms of
dollars, as reported on the balance sheet, supply chain planners typically view inven-
tory in terms of units. What is the right viewpoint if we expect to manage this invest-
ment? Actually, assuming multiple perspectives about inventory is a worthwhile way
to approach this topic.
</p>
<p>Companies that are serious about managing inventory must visualize how their
practices and approaches will affect the three Vs of inventory management&mdash;the vol-
ume, velocity, and value of inventory. Exhibit 16.11 on p. 608 highlights the &ldquo;Three-V
Model of Inventory Management,&rdquo; including key objectives, measures, and examples of
activities that relate to each dimension.
</p>
<p>Volume refers to the amount of inventory that a firm owns at any given time. Vol-
ume measures will relate to total units on hand, including safety stock levels. Velocity
refers to how quickly raw material and work-in-process inventory transform into fin-
ished goods that the customer accepts. As the rate at which inventory moves from
suppliers, through operations, and on to customers accelerates, the average amount
of inventory on hand at any given time is reduced. Faster velocity requires a lower
commitment of working capital and improves cash flow. Velocity measures include
material throughput rates, inventory turns, and order-to-cash cycle times. Finally,
value refers to the unit cost of the inventory. Key measures include standard costs
and the total value of inventory, including raw materials, components, subassemblies,
and finished goods.
</p>
<p>Although certain actions can predominantly affect a specific variable (velocity, vol-
ume, or value), there is often interdependence among these variables. The point here
is that organizations must pursue activities and approaches that positively affect the
volume, value, and velocity of inventory through and across the supply chain. The fol-
lowing sections present some powerful ways to manage inventory investment. S

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Achieve Perfect Record Integrity
A logical place to begin when managing inventory investment is to make sure
</p>
<p>there is agreement between physical and electronic inventory. Firms often compen-
sate for error and variability in supply chains with excess inventory, usually in the
form of safety stock or safety lead times. This also applies when there is excessive er-
ror in record integrity systems. Perfect record integrity must become an important in-
ventory management objective.
</p>
<p>Record integrity is the result of various activities and procedures designed to en-
sure that the amount of physical material on hand (POH) is equal to the computer-
ized record of material on hand (ROH). In short, record integrity exists when the
physical inventory on hand equals the electronic record on hand (POH = ROH), re-
gardless of the quantity of inventory. Any difference between POH and ROH rep-
resents error. This error can be the result of operationally mismanaging inventory,
which affects the physical (POH) side of record integrity. Error can also result from
systems-related sources, which affect the computerized side (ROH) of record integ-
rity. Concern over managing the actual volume, velocity, and value of inventory
should arise only after we have confidence in the integrity of inventory records.
</p>
<p>The effects of poor record integrity on supply chain operations can be severe.
When physical inventory exceeds the amount the computerized system believes is

<p>available (POH &gt; ROH), the physical inventory cannot be sold or used to satisfy cus-
tomer demand. When the record on hand is larger than what is physically available
(ROH &gt; POH), there is the risk that an item will be scheduled for production or
even sold to a customer when in fact it is not available. This inevitably leads to back-
order situations and dissatisfied customers.
</p>
<p>When record integrity is lacking (i.e., there are discrepancies between physical
quantities and electronic records), steps must be taken to identify the sources of error
with corrective action expected. This will require asking and answering a range of
questions. For example, are record errors displaying a random or systematic pattern
across SKUs? How severe are the differences between physical stock and electronic
records? Are proper receiving, stockkeeping, and withdrawal procedures and systems
in place? Is theft a problem? Are suppliers shipping quantities that match their docu-
mentation? Are effective cycle-counting procedures used? Is inventory scrap and obso-
lescence accounted for correctly? Do employees properly move, handle, and disburse
material?
</p>
<p>Record integrity is an essential but often overlooked part of inventory manage-
ment. It is difficult to manage inventory when we lack confidence in knowing what
we own or physically have on hand.
</p>
<p>Improve Product Forecasting
Perhaps the most important piece of information that moves across a supply
</p>
<p>chain is the forecast of end customer demand. Unfortunately, many companies fail to
recognize the effect that inaccurate forecasting has on the volume and velocity at
which inventory moves toward the customer. The downside of poor forecasting in-
cludes higher inventory volumes and carrying charges, poor customer service as inven-
tory is misallocated across locations and products, and excessive safety stock levels.
For companies that are serious about better inventory management, improving the
quality of product forecasts, like improving record integrity, is an ideal place to start.
</p>
<p>Longs Drug Stores illustrates the benefits of better forecasting and product place-
ment.9 This company has improved its ability to identify the best possible combina-
tion of when to order prescription drugs, how to ship them, and how much to carry
in a retail outlet on any given day. The company worked with a third party to de-
velop a system that pulls data each day from point-of-sale terminals at hundreds of
stores. Then, using two years of historical data and a forecasting algorithm that in-
cludes 150 variables per product that effectively predicts consumer demand out to 91
days, the company determines finished goods requirements for its retail outlets on a
daily basis. The system also determines the amount to order from upstream suppliers
(the pharmaceutical companies).
</p>
<p>What effect has improved forecasting had on inventory and capital requirements?
Longs executives say that the new system has allowed a 26% reduction in systemwide
inventory requirements, leading to $30 million in savings. This system has also freed
$60 million in working capital, which the company has used to acquire a 20-store
drug chain. The results are so encouraging that Longs signed a five-year extension
with its third-party forecaster and expects to extend the system to include nonprescrip-
tion products in the front of its stores. This example illustrates the link between bet-
ter forecasting, reduced inventory requirements, and improved financial performance.

<p>Standardize and Simplify Product Design
Why be concerned with standardizing and simplifying designs? A simplified de-
</p>
<p>sign usually requires fewer part numbers, resulting in fewer suppliers, reduced transac-
tions to support the inventory, and lower inventory management costs. The elimi-
nation of unnecessary components also reduces product cost, which reduces the value
of the inventory required to support customer demand and service requirements. In
some cases, this approach to greater standardization may require a major cultural
shift in the company and a strategic decision to move in a particular direction. In
many cases, the product complexity decision is embedded in the very DNA of the or-
ganization and requires a fundamental shift driven by top leadership toward contain-
ing complexity and SKU proliferation. For example, a leading truck manufacturer
was undergoing a major shift in company philosophy, in which the entire product
line and product offering was undergoing a major transformation:
</p>
<p>We are primarily engineer to order historically&mdash;but are moving more to-
wards standardized options. We are making some components standard
and are moving from 13 variations to 3 or 4 and are being pushed to do
that by senior management. As it stands historically, if the customer
wanted it we would put it on. The move towards standardization is a
senior management decision. We have some tools to measure complexity
versus revenue generated whereby we are able to establish a value for that
option. It is easy to determine which parts a customer wants and what we
charge for it&mdash;and in these cases we can do a pretty good job of passing it
on with a nice margin.10
</p>
<p>Product design is the right time to consider simplification and standardization, al-
though continuous improvement efforts can later alter existing designs. Many compa-
nies use value-engineering techniques during product design to reduce part count
and cost. Some of the other policies used to improve design simplification and re-
duce complexity are as follows.
</p>
<p>Establish Premium Pricing for Customization
Many companies are loath to develop premium pricing options. However, this
</p>
<p>practice can assist in shaping customer demand and can even, in some cases, drive ad-
ditional margin into the business if required. Many companies are now recognizing
that there is a cost to complexity and that customers should be willing to pay more
to offset these costs.
</p>
<p>Establish Geographic-Specific Options and Standards
Companies are also working to establish regional requirements based on regional
</p>
<p>customer preferences and designing supply chain configurations around these re-
gional requirements. This approach must be orchestrated carefully with plants and
suppliers to ensure success and accommodate appropriate order-to-delivery lead time
promises aligned with this design. For example, one manufacturing company noted
the following:
</p>
<p>We are also standardizing certain configurations around certain regions of
the country where our plants are. Our plants are from Seattle to Montreal,
to the Midwest, Canada, and Mexico to the Southwest and Southeast&mdash;and
the options are very distinct. Texas truckers like shiny stuff, Midwestern

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>ones, not so much. So we configure by plant and by region. If someone
wants an option in one area they have to go to a different plant. This is
managed by our order fulfillment group that allows us to maintain good
plant focus for certain options and configurations.11
</p>
<p>Maintain a Database of Option Requests
One company has dedicated a formal approach to maintaining complexity and has
</p>
<p>identified this as a core element, even though it acknowledged the problems associ-
ated with managing the business in this manner and the pain inflicted on the supply
chain. The order fulfillment manager described the emotional decisions and back-
room wars that took place when they were bought out and the buyer sought to stan-
dardize components of their product line, considered to be a company trademark:
</p>
<p>We track active options and custom unpublished options. We track usage,
and if we have a group of options that has no usage over time, we will try
to eliminate them from the available product offerings and get them out of
the maintenance mode. On the other hand, if we have some customized op-
tions showing increasing usage, we will promote them to a published stan-
dard as it is becoming a popular item. In that case we will look closely at
the design to see if it is designed for higher volume, to get some cost out of
the process.12
</p>
<p>Do Not Eliminate Frequently Requested Options!
The importance of maintaining a company&rsquo;s trademark requirements in product
</p>
<p>design can be an important counterpoint to the standardization argument. An organi-
zation needs to carefully evaluate the standardization decision and ensure it does not
design out elements that are critical to its product branding and positioning.
</p>
<p>Utilize Business Modeling and TCO Tools to Support Complexity
Reduction Decisions
</p>
<p>Many companies are developing more formal approaches to managing complexity
and have developed business modeling and TCO approaches to developing a busi-
ness case with tools associated with the decision. For example, Dell Computer utilizes
a template of decision criteria against which product design decisions are baselined:
</p>
<p>1. Will the item be sole, single, or multisourced?
</p>
<p>2. Does the new offering involve a new technology risk item (this could signal a
potential quality yield risk)?
</p>
<p>3. Who are the manufacturers and who are the integrators for the parts?
</p>
<p>4. Where are all the suppliers located and what is the logistics plan?
</p>
<p>5. Where are these parts used in the industry today and in future, which could af-
fect overall demand?
</p>
<p>6. What are the expected cost takedown rates?
</p>
<p>7. What does the product roadmap look like in terms of possible product sub-
stitutes?
</p>
<p>8. Are there any key alliances that need to be considered from key suppliers/
competitors?

<p>9. What is the flexibility to use a particular part in other product lines, or is this
part leveraged from another product?
</p>
<p>10. Can these parts be sold as aftermarket options or service parts?13
</p>
<p>Leverage Companywide Purchase Volumes
The consolidation or leveraging of common items and services across buying loca-
</p>
<p>tions has increased dramatically over the last 10 years, including across worldwide
units.14 This has resulted in major savings as leveraged agreements lead to lower mate-
rial costs. Lower material costs can significantly reduce the amount of capital commit-
ted to inventory over the life of an agreement.
</p>
<p>Besides seeking a lower unit cost in leveraged agreements, buyers often pursue
other nonprice issues that affect inventory investment. One such issue is consignment,
which the APICS Dictionary defines as the process of a supplier placing goods at a cus-
tomer location without receiving payment until after the buyer uses the goods. The
advantage of consignment to the buyer is the ability to defer ownership and avoid
committing working capital and incurring carrying charges. This reduces the average
amount of inventory a buyer owns as well as improving velocity.
</p>
<p>Use Suppliers for On-Site Inventory Management
Almost all organizations use distributors to provide at least some portion of their
</p>
<p>inventory requirements, particularly maintenance, repair, and operating supplies. A
distributor may stock and sell a full range of items from different manufacturers. If
the purchaser has enough volume, then the distributor may be willing to locate an em-
ployee at the purchaser&rsquo;s facility to manage the inventory.
</p>
<p>Purchasers are increasingly entering partnerships or formal agreements with dis-
tributors featuring on-site support. Besides the on-site support, these agreements stipu-
late that a supplier/distributor will stock a wider range of items and provide agreed-
upon service levels. The buyer, in exchange for purchasing solely from the distributor,
no longer stocks inventory for items under contract.
</p>
<p>The on-site representative orders on an as-needed basis, often directly into the dis-
tributor&rsquo;s order-processing system. This reduces the amount of paperwork required
to submit an order. A buying firm avoids stocking or managing this inventory, while
the distributor benefits from a higher share of a purchaser&rsquo;s total purchase require-
ments. Not stocking the items relieves the purchaser of carrying inventory.
</p>
<p>The purchase of most MRO items is a nuisance because (1) they require a dispro-
portionate amount of a buyer&rsquo;s time and (2) this often involves lower-value items. A
formal agreement providing on-site supplier support can reduce the MRO ordering
problem. These arrangements offer an opportunity to control a category of inventory
that usually does not receive enough attention.
</p>
<p>Reduce Supplier-Buyer Cycle Times
Shortening the material pipeline in terms of time between suppliers and a buyer
</p>
<p>can reduce the average amount of inventory in a system. One area of emphasis will
be to support reduced order-cycle times with suppliers. A reduced (and reliable) or-
der-cycle time positively affects inventory investment by allowing frequent orders re-
ceived in smaller quantities. Planning horizons are also shorter, which reduces the
need to carry safety stock.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Several actions support reduced order-cycle time with suppliers:
</p>
<p>&bull; Expanded electronic capability. The electronic exchange of information in a
supply chain supports paperless procurement, faster data movement, and in-
creased information accuracy. Electronic data interchange has the potential
to reduce order-cycle times by 15 to 40% from current levels.
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier development support. Supplier development means working directly
with suppliers to improve performance. This support may include working
directly at a supplier&rsquo;s facilities to speed order entry, production, and deliv-
ery through the removal of waste.
</p>
<p>&bull; Order-cycle time measurement. Tracking order-cycle times helps identify
areas of improvement. We expect to see greater emphasis on the develop-
ment of performance measures that are time oriented.
</p>
<p>&bull; Focus on second- and third-tier suppliers. Total supply chain management re-
quires working with first-, second-, and even third-tier suppliers. The ability
of a purchaser to reduce order-cycle time and inventory with its immediate
suppliers is partly a function of a supplier being able to work with its suppli-
ers. Suppliers located two and three tiers from the buyer will increasingly cap-
ture the interest of supply chain managers.
</p>
<p>The activities described here are not the only actions that supply chain managers
can or will emphasize to manage inventory investment. This discussion points out,
however, that there are creative approaches for the systemwide control and manage-
ment of inventory investment.
</p>
<p>Delivering the Perfect Customer Order
Managing inventory investment is not only important from a financial perspec-
</p>
<p>tive. If a firm can balance the right supply of inventory with the demand for inven-
tory across a supply chain, it increases the probability that it can deliver the perfect
order to customers. Simply put, the perfect customer order is one that is delivered on
time, accurately, and in perfect condition. &ldquo;The perfect order metric is especially valu-
able because it is a comprehensive measure of demand-fulfillment capability and acts
as a lightning rod for all the deficiencies in a company&rsquo;s operations,&rdquo; said Debra Hoff-
man, a Boston-based consultant.15 Although most companies measure different ele-
ments contained in the perfect order measure, only 40% have a perfect customer
order measure.16
</p>
<p>A number of factors can cause an order not to be perfect, some of which are inven-
tory related. Orders may be late due to supplier delivery problems, stockouts or
manufacturing delays, or in-transit or delivery delays to customers. An order that ar-
rives at the customer may not meet specifications because of inaccurate quantities,
poor quality of finished goods, damage during transit, or incorrect or missing docu-
mentation. Any of these conditions can result in a less-than-perfect order.
</p>
<p>The following identifies various planning systems and ways that progressive com-
panies bring all parts of the supply chain together to pursue the perfect customer
order.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Material Requirements Planning System
When we discuss systems that forecast future demand for products or services we
</p>
<p>sell, we are referring to independent demand systems. This means that demand for
an item is not directly dependent upon the demand for any other item that we pro-
duce. Systems that plan at the independent demand level are critical for achieving
the perfect customer order.
</p>
<p>A major task of the materials manager, however, is to control the inventory of
items whose demand is dependent on the production of other items. A riding lawn
mower is an example of an independent demand item. Demand for the final part is in-
dependent&mdash;expected orders determine the final amount produced. The demand for
the steering wheel or tires that go on the mower, for example, are dependent on the
demand for the mower. The component or subassembly demand is simply a function
of the production schedule for the final part number.
</p>
<p>A widely used system that controls dependent demand inventory is the material re-
quirements planning system. An MRP system takes a period-by-period set of master
production schedule requirements (anticipated or booked customer orders) and pro-
duces a time-phased set of material, component, and subassembly requirements timed
to support an expected build schedule. This system relies on production schedules devel-
oped for final part numbers in the master production schedule to determine the timing
and quantities of materials required for components or subassemblies. If supplier qual-
ity and lead times are reliable, planners can time the arrival of components just before
production of the final part number.
</p>
<p>Component requirements and quantities required to produce or assemble a final
part number appear on a bill of material file. The bill of material file details the compo-
nents or subassemblies and the quantity required to produce a final part number or
end item. In some systems, the bill of material also indicates if any components require
components themselves. Components that require components are subassemblies of
the final part number. An MRP system links directly to the bill of material file and
recognizes what components or subassemblies must go into the final item or package.
The system will also recognize how many of each part may already be on hand.
</p>
<p>Distribution Resource Planning System
Distribution resource planning (DRP) systems attempt to make the most effective
</p>
<p>use of finished-goods inventories. These systems, which are concerned with inventory
that has left the work-in-process status and is working its way through a channel of
distribution toward the customer, perform many functions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Forecasting finished-goods inventory requirements
</p>
<p>&bull; Establishing correct inventory levels at each stocking location
</p>
<p>&bull; Determining the timing and replenishment of finished-goods inventories
</p>
<p>&bull; Allocating items in short supply
</p>
<p>&bull; Transportation planning and vehicle load scheduling
</p>
<p>A DRP system, combined with upstream supply chain planning systems such as
MRP, can provide a total supply chain perspective.

<p>Supply Chain Inventory Planners
The establishment of a supply chain or logistical planner position responsible for
</p>
<p>working with supply chain planning and execution systems is gaining popularity as a
way to pursue the perfect customer order. A supply chain planner, a position often or-
ganized along product lines, manages the flow of inventory and information from sup-
pliers through end customers. This position ties together the requirements of
purchasing/materials management, production, inventory control, and product dis-
tribution.
</p>
<p>The planner coordinates the movement and placement of inventory throughout
the supply, production, and distribution channel. This position also acts as the liai-
son between various groups in the supply chain. Other assignments include develop-
ing smooth production schedules, establishing production targets from marketing
forecasts, determining inventory deployment at field warehouses, and continuously
evaluating inventory safety stock levels. The supply chain planner works closely with
purchasing to coordinate material requirements to support production targets and
with marketing and sales to meet customer order requirements. The performance of
the planner is often measured against his or her ability to ensure that customers re-
ceive a perfect order.
</p>
<p>Automated Inventory Tracking Systems
Automated inventory control systems involve computerized material and elec-
</p>
<p>tronic data interchange systems that track the flow of inventory throughout the en-
tire supply chain. This approach electronically connects suppliers, production plants,
field distribution centers, and even customers. A customer may be a retail outlet or
an independent distributor.
</p>
<p>An integrated systems approach relies on new forms of information technology,
such as EDI and bar code scanning, to link the entire supply chain electronically.
Wal-Mart, for example, has benefited greatly from automated inventory tracking sys-
tems, using bar code technology to capture data at the point of sale and sending this
up the supply chain to suppliers. Tracking sales allows Wal-Mart to identify what is
selling and to replenish shelves quickly. Automated tracking systems present an op-
portunity for controlling inventory investment throughout the entire supply chain. In-
creasingly, producers and channel members use radio frequency identification tags to
track material movement across the supply chain. Real-time visibility to inventory
across the supply chain makes planning for the perfect customer order that much
easier.

<p>Lockheed Martin Energy Systems (LMES) has taken an aggressive step to control its
maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) suppliers. Confronted by a constant flow of small-
dollar purchase requests, thousands of individual MRO suppliers, and difficulty tracking inven-
tory and usage, LMES created its Accelerated Vendor Inventory Delivery (AVID) system. This S

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>system links LMES electronically with a selected group of MRO distributors and allows users
to order online using electronic catalogs. Exhibit 16.12 provides an overview of the AVID
system.
</p>
<p>Relying extensively on electronic data interchange between the user and suppliers, AVID al-
lows users to control the purchase of low-dollar off-the-shelf items while significantly reduc-
ing the transaction costs of processing low-value purchases. Items typically acquired
electronically through the system include electrical items, paper, lab supplies, building sup-
plies, personal computers, electronics, and office supplies. The AVID system, which traces its
origin back to 1988, allows more than 3,400 users to conduct transactions with 36 suppli-
ers. The system accounts for 225,000 transactions involving $55 million per year.
</p>
<p>The company has attained certain benefits from this system, most of which directly affect
MRO inventory investment:
</p>
<p>&bull; Established a just-in-time delivery system for MRO purchasing

<p>&bull; Increased purchasing power due to larger volumes with fewer suppliers
&bull; Eliminated the need for stocking MRO items at the company&rsquo;s facilities

<p>&bull; Created a streamlined channel of electronic communication between LMES and

&bull; Reduced inventory-carrying costs drastically

&bull; Improved accountability from both users and suppliers
</p>
<p>LMES offers selected suppliers the opportunity to become the company&rsquo;s sole supplier for
a wide range of items. In return, the company requires a price reduction on MRO items,
24-hour turnaround on regular replenishment orders, two-hour emergency deliveries, and no
paperwork. In addition, suppliers must broaden their own inventory levels and depth to
meet company requirements.
</p>
<p>When the AVID system was developed, a steering committee was put in place that included re-
presentatives from executive management, accounts payable, accounts receivable, procure-
ment, treasury, and business systems. In addition, the company established an AVID project
team and an AVID advisory team to monitor the operation of the system and to assume re-
sponsibility for the selection of AVID suppliers.
</p>
<p>The selection criteria for AVID suppliers include technical and price considerations. The techni-
cal criteria include the supplier&rsquo;s warehouse and delivery capabilities, inventory manage-
ment, financial strength, and the ability to work with the AVID system. Technical criteria
during the selection process are weighted 60 percent while price is weighted 40 percent. Qual-
ity and time are also critical considerations during selection. For example, can a chosen sup-
plier deliver the correct product in 24 hours?
</p>
<p>A Web-based version of AVID now includes current suppliers but also allows LMES to in-
crease the number of electronic catalogs that are part of the system. The AVID system clearly
demonstrates that a company can successfully manage low-value inventory to create high-
dollar savings.

<p>CONCLUSION
The dollars committed to inventory represent a major investment. Like any invest-
</p>
<p>ment, careful management will help ensure the investment provides an adequate re-
turn. Lean supply chain management requires the involvement of multiple parties
within the organization, including senior leadership, operational executives and line
managers, supply chain managers, logistics, transportation, finance, and other key
players, all of whom play an important role in the management of inventory invest-
ment. The goal of this chapter is to create an awareness of (1) the function of inven-
tory, (2) the operational problems that tempt firms to increase inventory levels, (3)
the major approaches used to manage inventory investment, and (4) the role of lean
thinking in managing inventory. As firms continue to outsource more of their opera-
tional and manufacturing requirements, the inclusion of inventory cost within the to-
tal cost of ownership equation will also continue to be a challenge and will cause
supply chain executives to continue to update their strategies in light of different re-
quirements for trading off supply chain risk, inventory investment, customer respon-
siveness, and financial performance.

<p>Indirect spending continues to receive growing attention from top management at
large corporations. This spend category can be defined as the sum of all purchased
goods and services that are not a direct part of products or services delivered to the
customer. It is not uncommon for indirect spend to equal 50% or more of a com-
pany&rsquo;s total purchases. Unfortunately, a substantial amount of indirect spend is not
purchased using the organization&rsquo;s formal sourcing function or established supply
management processes. Many companies, like Saab in the opening vignette, are ag-
gressively measuring and attacking costs of indirect purchasing. Senior management
have realized that reducing or eliminating their firm&rsquo;s indirect spend offers an opportu-
nity to substantially reduce a company&rsquo;s costs. Common examples of indirect spend
</p>
<p>Indirect Purchasing at Saab
</p>
<p>As part of a major corporate reorganization in the 1990s, Saab decided to centralize
and modernize many of its core support functions, including indirect purchasing. This initia-
tive was designed to improve corporate efficiency and increase the firm&rsquo;s profitability. Mag-
nus Str&ouml;mer, Saab&rsquo;s vice president of corporate sourcing, was tasked with centralizing a
historically decentralized purchasing organization. Analysis of the company revealed that
Saab had minimal control and visibility of its indirect spend.
</p>
<p>Based on the results of an internal purchasing survey, Str&ouml;mer and his staff decided that
more than 80% of indirect material sourcing could be consolidated and leveraged at the cor-
porate level. The survey also indicated that the company suffered from a lack of automation,
high levels of maverick spending, and almost no enterprisewide contracts in its indirect
spend.
</p>
<p>Over the following year and a half, Saab was able to totally revamp its indirect spend by cen-
tralizing its staff, utilizing a common strategic sourcing process, and deploying a variety of
tools and methods, including e-procurement. More than 4,800 purchase orders per month are
now placed using the new e-procurement system. Str&ouml;mer indicates that this is a continu-
ous, dynamic process.
</p>
<p>The next steps for Saab include developing and implementing global corporate contracts
with many of its suppliers and evaluating use of the e-procurement tool globally. Initial re-
sults indicate far fewer manual transactions and paper invoices. Str&ouml;mer says, &ldquo;If we look
at our annual spend of SEK 2.6 billion (EUR 290 million), we have saved SEK 230 million, or
roughly 10%, of our total spend per year. This is very important as Saab, like every other com-
pany, needs to look at costs to be successful on the market.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Part of this implementation process has been focused on the identification and development
of &ldquo;super users,&rdquo; who set the standard for sourcing performance and can help show other
users how to effectively use the process to their advantage. Once other users were made
aware of the system&rsquo;s benefits, it was easy to get them to accept and adopt the new tool.
</p>
<p>Corporate support of the new e-procurement process and tools was demonstrated by wide-
spread acceptance of Saab&rsquo;s top management team. They supported the implementation by de-
veloping broad policies and mandates that applied to those who were not prone to accept the
system. Other supporting activities included delivering measurable results and storytelling of
successes.

<p>include professional services, consulting, utilities, travel, maintenance, repair, operating
supplies, and employee benefits. However, because of industry differences, one com-
pany&rsquo;s indirect spend may be considered direct spend for another.
</p>
<p>Historically, expenditures for indirect materials and services have not received the
same level of management attention as have direct materials. They are typically con-
trolled and spent from outside the supply management hierarchy even though the dol-
lar amount of such expenditures is usually fairly significant as a percentage of total
purchases. As such, organizations have overlooked a substantial opportunity to effec-
tively reduce cost in the services supply chain.1
</p>
<p>A substantial area of indirect spend that does affect customers is the purchase of
transportation and logistics services. Companies are increasingly using third-party lo-
gistics (3PL) companies to create competitive marketplace advantage from which
their customers benefit directly. Without effective transportation sourcing, getting the
right product to the right place in the right condition at the right time becomes prob-
lematic. Selecting the right transportation and logistics provider can be as critical as
any other supplier evaluation and selection decision, perhaps even more so.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we begin by describing the role that supply management plays in
managing the organization&rsquo;s indirect spend. We begin by discussing that role in man-
aging transportation, then discuss other areas of indirect spending (such as services)
where supply management can have a major impact on the cost structure and perfor-
mance of organizations today.
</p>
<p>Transportation Management
The Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals defines logistics manage-
</p>
<p>ment as &ldquo;that part of supply chain management that plans, implements, and controls
the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and re-
lated information between the point of origin and the point of consumption in order
to meet customers&rsquo; requirements.&rdquo;2 Transportation is a key element of logistics man-
agement, and logistics management, in turn, is a key element of supply chain man-
agement.3
</p>
<p>Transportation service providers support the four major linkages throughout a typ-
ical supply chain shown in Exhibit 17.1 on p. 624: (1) inbound logistics, (2) in-
traorganizational movements, (3) outbound logistics, and (4) recovery and recycling
(or reverse logistics). The first link includes all inbound shipments moving between
supplier and buyer facilities. This element is often included in sourcing negotiations
and is a substantial part of the contractual terms discussed earlier.
</p>
<p>Companies with multiple production and warehouse locations usually have a sec-
ond major transportation link&mdash;intraorganizational movement. This includes move-
ment of materials between production facilities within the same organization as well
as movement into and out of intermediary storage facilities. A storage facility may be
located in the same manufacturing complex as the production facility or at some
other geographic location, which another company may control. Some companies di-
rectly control the movement of goods within this link through the use of company-
owned or leased transportation vehicles, for example, its private fleet. Others are S

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>increasingly bypassing this link by producing material only when they have a cus-
tomer order, which allows direct shipment to the customer and thus reduces the
need for multiple handling through costly warehouse and distribution facilities.
</p>
<p>The third link&mdash;outbound logistics&mdash;represents the link between a company and
its customers. Historically, this was referred to as physical distribution, where the
transportation department controlled the movement of outbound goods while suppli-
ers arranged the movement of inbound freight to the buyer. Since the deregulation of
the transportation industry in the early 1980s, supply management&rsquo;s involvement
with the control of all three transportation links has increased greatly. The fourth
link is one that companies are increasingly becoming concerned with&mdash;recovery and
recycling of obsolete products and goods. This reverse logistics flow requires compa-
nies to find innovative methods of recovering and recycling products to minimize the
impact on the environment. This may also include the shipment of repairable items
back to maintenance facilities for refurbishment and return to usable condition.
</p>
<p>As organizations focus more on their core competencies, they come to recognize
that many of these transportation and logistics services can and should be out-
sourced to companies specializing in transportation and logistics services. When
these services are outsourced to third parties, supply management assumes the respon-
sibility of managing these relationships. Without effective and efficient sourcing and
management of transportation services, world-class supply chain management can
never be readily achieved. In order to describe these processes, we begin by briefly dis-
cussing the deregulation of the transportation industry in the United States, followed
by supply management&rsquo;s role in sourcing transportation services, and an effective deci-
sion-making framework for developing transportation strategy. We will then focus
specifically on how to manage third-party logistics providers.

<p>Deregulation of Transportation and Supply
Management&rsquo;s New Role
</p>
<p>Transportation Deregulation
Legislation passed in the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s, de-
</p>
<p>signed to open up economic competition in transportation, also encouraged supply
management&rsquo;s involvement in the procurement and management of transportation
services. Congress passed the Air Cargo Deregulation Act in 1977, the Air Passenger
Deregulation Act in 1978, and the Negotiated Rates Act in 1993. Shortly after, the Mo-
tor Carrier Act of 1980 and the Staggers Rail Act became law. Other major deregula-
tion legislation in the United States includes the Transportation Industry Regulation
Reform Act of 1994, the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (creating the Surface Transpor-
tation Board), and the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, which reduced the Fed-
eral Maritime Commission&rsquo;s authority.4
</p>
<p>The primary objective of deregulation in the United States was to make its domes-
tic transportation system more efficient by increasing marketplace competition in the
transportation industry and reducing burdensome economic regulation. From the
buyer&rsquo;s perspective, these laws offered new opportunities to negotiate lower transpor-
tation rates and higher service levels with individual carriers. From the carrier&rsquo;s per-
spective, these laws took away a comfortable blanket of government protection and
significantly reduced profit margins on almost all national contracts. Many carriers
had to learn how to compete in a deregulated market and become more cost efficient
in the process. Many long-standing carriers in all modes that were not able to do so
went out of business or merged with other carriers in order to survive in a new,
open, competitive economy.
</p>
<p>These carriers now had to compete openly and aggressively against new entrants,
existing carriers, and competition from other modes of transportation. They also had
to contend with requests for substantial discounts from their published tariff rates, al-
though filing published tariff rates with the federal government is no longer required.
These legislative changes vastly reshaped the domestic transportation industry. Both
supply and transportation managers discovered they now had the power to influence
both transportation cost and corresponding service levels. Buyers became increasingly
involved in the buying of transportation services, something that did not frequently
occur when transportation was highly regulated economically.
</p>
<p>If Congress had not deregulated the transportation industry, it is likely that supply
management would not have taken as great an interest in the evaluation, selection,
and control of transportation service providers. Although each piece of legislation cre-
ated some level of uncertainty for both shippers and carriers, the legislation also cre-
ated opportunities for innovative buyers to add new value through the procurement
of transportation services.
</p>
<p>Effectively managing transportation services is important for several reasons. First,
transportation is a major cost center at most manufacturing companies. On average,
transportation costs comprise 10% of a product&rsquo;s total cost. For many firms, logistics
expenses are second only to material costs in terms of their impact on the cost of
goods sold, and logistics expenditures represent one of the largest costs in interna-
tional commerce.
</p>
<p>Perhaps even more important than cost savings is the direct impact transportation
has on operations. Transportation affects production and scheduling systems, inventory

<p>levels, carrying costs, and customer order management. Companies that do not effec-
tively manage transportation activities will experience increased waste, higher costs, and
reduced competitiveness. Although often taken for granted, transportation can have seri-
ous consequences if not managed properly. When managed properly, world-class trans-
portation systems can satisfy end-customer needs faster and at a lower cost.
</p>
<p>A New Role for Supply Management
As supply management professionals take a more active role in transportation pro-
</p>
<p>curement, what exactly are the duties they assume? Supply management can support
the purchase of inbound, outbound, and ancillary transportation services just as it sup-
ports the purchase of other products, materials, and services. As supply managers
take an active role in transportation decision making, they often become involved
with identifying and selecting inbound transportation carriers and service providers,
although greater involvement with outbound transportation providers is becoming
more common in best-in-class firms.
</p>
<p>Supply management can also negotiate long-term freight agreements and evaluate
carrier performance similarly to evaluating suppliers of purchased goods. The trans-
portation department, if one still exists, usually involves itself with day-to-day man-
agement of the overall transportation system or the development of transportation
strategies that need not involve supply management. These non-procurement-related
activities may include arranging pickups and deliveries, processing damage and loss
claims, tracing and expediting shipments as required, coordinating interplant and out-
bound movements, auditing freight bills for accuracy, and determining plant and
warehouse locations.
</p>
<p>Both the supply management and transportation departments need to combine
their individual expertise when developing transportation strategies. Transportation-
related decisions should not be made in a vacuum.
</p>
<p>A Decision-Making Framework for Developing
a Transportation Strategy
</p>
<p>The development of an effective transportation strategy typically involves a series
of decisions. Exhibit 17.2 outlines a general framework of normal decisions and is-
sues that a supply manager faces when helping formulate the organization&rsquo;s transpor-
tation strategy. How a transportation network is designed and organized may vary
greatly depending on the commodity or material. For example, transporting bulk
raw material usually requires rail or barge movement, whereas small, costly, time-
sensitive components may use faster but more expensive modes such as airfreight.
No single approach or strategy covers the entire transportation needs of a company.
</p>
<p>Determine When and Where to Control Transportation
The initial decision regarding transportation requirements involves determining
</p>
<p>how, when, and where to control shipments. A significant amount of inbound domes-
tic materials, for example, is still shipped FOB destination. This means the supplier re-
tains title to the goods and controls the shipment until it is physically received and
off-loaded at the consignee&rsquo;s dock. Unless otherwise negotiated, this also means the
supplier is responsible for paying the carrier&rsquo;s freight bill and filing any loss and dam-
age claims against the carrier. In this case, these costs are included in the invoiced
unit price to the buying company. Controlling inbound shipment costs usually re-

<p>quires purchasing goods under a shipping designation of FOB origin. Here, the buyer
or consignee is responsible for selecting the carrier, arranging the movement, paying
the freight bill, and filing loss and damage claims. The title of the goods passes when
the goods are tendered to the carrier at the loading site. A savvy buyer will want to
control these costs internally instead of simply allowing the shipper to pass them
along in the form of a delivered price. FOB origin is more complicated than buying
goods with a delivered price, but the buyer can more effectively monitor its freight
costs and delivery performance.
</p>
<p>Whenever a supplier includes transportation charges as part of the unit cost of a
good (i.e., FOB destination), the buyer often loses the ability to track or control its

<p>inbound transportation expenses. This also artificially increases the value of the buy-
er&rsquo;s inventory, which may have tax and other financial implications. Even when a sup-
plier assumes responsibility for transportation costs, buyers may require the supplier
to identify and list transportation-related costs separately from material costs on the
invoice.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 17.3 compares these two primary FOB shipping designations as well as the
Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) sections that apply to domestic transportation
shipments.
</p>
<p>The choice of insourcing or outsourcing transportation services is similar to a typi-
cal make-or-buy decision. A buyer who chooses to have an external party, such as a
supplier or a third-party logistics provider, arrange and control its shipments has
abdicated the ability to make further decisions regarding the movement. For some ship-
ments, such as low-volume shipments, a buyer may determine it is not worth spending
the time and energy necessary to arrange and manage their own transportation needs.
When this is the case, an option is to provide suppliers with a list of preapproved or
otherwise acceptable carriers or 3PLs. The buyer may even have a contract in place
with the carrier for discounted freight rates based on combined volume. A buyer who
relinquishes control of inbound transportation to a supplier or 3PL should still periodi-
cally evaluate the delivery performance of externally arranged shipments.
</p>
<p>Another option here involves the use of a third-party transportation broker or in-
termediary, such as a forwarder. Although this also means giving up direct control of
shipments, a buyer may realize additional benefits. The preferred broker or intermedi-
ary must have the buyer&rsquo;s best interests in mind, as the buyer is the intermediary&rsquo;s
immediate customer. The broker or intermediary acts as the buyer&rsquo;s agent when
arranging transportation. The intermediary can also consolidate the buyer&rsquo;s ship-
ments with those of other customers to achieve a lower total transportation cost.
Intermediaries can also perform other value-added services, such as expediting customs,
negotiating rates directly with carriers, providing temporary storage, or performing light

sources or experience to manage their own transportation systems. It is also an appropri-
ate option for small or infrequent shipments.
</p>
<p>Identify Key Transportation Performance Variables
Different carrier or 3PL performance variables must be carefully determined and
</p>
<p>evaluated when developing an effective transportation strategy. Data on the following
set of variables should be collected and evaluated when comparing competing trans-
portation modes as well as specific carriers within the same mode. The criteria used
to measure transportation performance are shown in Exhibit 17.4.
</p>
<p>Total Cost
Total cost plays a major role in the transportation decision-making framework. If
</p>
<p>cost were unimportant, more shipments would arrive via air carrier instead of by truck
or rail. Cost, however, is only one of a number of important variables. Selecting a mode
or carrier based solely on the lowest freight cost ignores the total cost and customer ser-
vice implications of the decision. The lowest-cost mode or carrier may not provide reli-
able delivery or other value-added services that separate marginal from exceptional
service providers. The cost variable, although important, should not be the sole variable
used. Furthermore, any cost evaluation should always be in a total cost context, not
merely using the price shown on the freight bill. An apparently low-cost carrier may actu-
ally end up costing far more than a seemingly higher-cost carrier when the total associ-
ated costs are calculated. Note, however, that the typical cost accounting system may not
fully delineate where all of the costs are derived. Costs may also change over time (see
Sourcing Snapshot: Trucking Costs Rise under New Federal Hours of Service Rules).
</p>
<p>Speed
This variable refers to the in-transit time of a mode or carrier. For some items,
</p>
<p>such as bulk raw materials, speed may not be an important factor. For producers oper-
ating in a time-sensitive or just-in-time environment, speed is the critical factor for

materials, hazardous materials, etc.

<p>Trucking Costs Rise under
New Federal Hours of
Service Rules
</p>
<p>The first major changes in truck driver work hours since 1939 are designed to reduce
highway fatalities but will also contribute to the biggest non-fuel-related increase in truck-
ing rates in two decades. These hours of service (HOS) changes, mandated under new sets
of federal safety rules that took effect in January 2004 and October 2005, are designed to re-
duce fatigue among truck drivers, a major cause of motor carrier accidents. The Federal Mo-
tor Carrier Safety Administration estimates that between 196 and 585 fatalities occur
annually due to driver fatigue. The new HOS rules increase the time that truck drivers must
rest in each 24-hour period to 10 hours, up from 8. Thus, the total time a driver can be on
duty will fall to 14 hours from 16 hours per day, including a maximum of 11 hours of driv-
ing time. Drivers will also be required to include, as work hours, that time spent waiting at
loading docks or fueling their rigs.
</p>
<p>Wal-Mart, which unsuccessfully opposed the new rules, believes that the more stringent 14-
hour rule will reduce its drivers&rsquo; daily work time by 6% on average and require it to add 275
new drivers and 300 new trucks just to handle the same amount of cargo volume. The giant
retailer expects the changes to cost it at least $24 million just for the additional trucks.
&ldquo;The rule will impose serious costs on society, not only on motor carriers but on shippers
and receivers as well,&rdquo; the company said in a regulatory filing. Because motor carriers
haul so much commerce, accounting for more than 81% of the U.S.&rsquo;s $571 billion freight-
transportation bill last year, the effects could be far-reaching, particularly when coupled with
higher fuel costs and a smaller pool of qualified truck drivers.
</p>
<p>Some users of truck transportation say higher motor carrier freight rates could lead to a broad-
based increase in prices of all goods, from paper to chemicals, diapers to trash cans. During
the last few years, the increasing number of failed trucking companies has led to a tight sup-
ply of transport capacity, as freight volumes have begun heading higher as the economy im-
proves. The United States has about 585,000 interstate motor carriers, the bulk of which
operate 20 or fewer trucks. Truckers and their customers are exploring ways to dodge the
higher costs, such as by combining more intermodal shipments with rail carriers. Other ini-
tiatives, such as improved handling of trucks and cargo at warehouses and distribution cen-
ters, could make truckers more efficient and perhaps offset some of the costs of the new HOS
rules. Indeed, freight docks have become a source of massive inefficiency, often holding up
trucks and drivers for hours on end. Under these new rules, such delays are very costly be-
cause they count as work time for drivers and thus cut into the time they can be on the road.

<p>often be shipped via high-speed priority carriers. Their value to the buyer is such
that tying them up in transit is not economically wise. Certain items will always ar-
rive by the same type of transportation mode simply because of their physical nature.
When this is the case, a lack of transportation flexibility concerning the speed vari-
able is something that must be managed by a buyer.
</p>
<p>Reliability
A critical performance variable for any mode or carrier is reliability, which refers
</p>
<p>to the accuracy and on-time consistency of the transportation service, arriving nei-
ther late nor early. It also relates to a carrier&rsquo;s ability to deliver a shipment in an un-
damaged condition.
</p>
<p>For example, if a carrier says a shipment will arrive at 9:00 a.m. on Monday morn-
ing, the consignee should expect that the shipment will actually arrive at the prom-
ised date and time. Note that reliability differs from speed&mdash;it is the measure of
actual arrivals against planned arrivals. A reliable carrier requiring a longer in-transit
time is oftentimes preferable to an unreliable carrier with a faster average in-transit
time, particularly from an operational planning perspective. The buyer requires less in-
ventory and safety stock to cover delivery variability from the more reliable carrier.
</p>
<p>Capability
This variable refers to a mode or carrier&rsquo;s ability to provide the proper equipment
</p>
<p>and provide the appropriate services for a given product movement. This variable
has several dimensions. First, does the mode or carrier have the physical capability to
transport an item? For example, can the carrier safely transport a hazardous material
or handle and transport large quantities of bulk products? Second, does the carrier
have the proper equipment in the right location to perform the requested move-
ment? Lastly, does the carrier have the equipment and resources to transport multi-
ple, frequent shipments for a specific traffic lane? Capability is important because it
affects a mode or carrier&rsquo;s ability to provide consistent transportation service or pro-
vide a requested service.
</p>
<p>Accessibility
Transportation accessibility refers to a mode or carrier&rsquo;s ability to provide service
</p>
<p>over a geographic area. A totally accessible mode or carrier is capable of picking up a
shipment and delivering it directly to its final destination. Geographic constraints,
however, restrict some modes. Inland water carriers, for example, are usually not ac-
cessible for most shippers, as lakes, rivers, and canals cannot be moved. Use of this
mode often requires another mode for pickup and delivery to and from the water-
way. Note that a carrier that cannot offer total accessibility for its customers is not
necessarily all bad. However, each time a shipment changes hands, additional han-
dling occurs, and a longer lead time must be accounted for. Also, the risk of greater
loss and damage increases.
</p>
<p>A carrier may not have the appropriate authority or travel the physical routes nec-
essary to transport goods between two points or to operate in a specific geographic re-
gion. Carriers lacking legal authority to move goods directly between two points are
considered not highly accessible. Motor carriers sometimes market their services on
the basis of their authority to operate in 48 states. Instead of using different carriers

<p>for different shipments around the country, one full-service carrier may be capable of
meeting an organization&rsquo;s total transportation requirements.
</p>
<p>Select a Transportation Mode
There must be a close match between those key transportation performance vari-
</p>
<p>ables identified in the previous section and the ability of the different modes or car-
riers to satisfy these variables. For some items, it is not a difficult decision to make.
For example, overseas shipments are usually shipped in containers via ocean vessel
or, in a limited number of cases, by air carrier. Bulk or liquid commodities, such as
coal or chemicals, usually ship via rail. The most common domestic modal decisions
involve comparisons and tradeoffs between rail and motor carrier, rail and inland wa-
ter, or motor and air carrier. The most common modal decision for international ship-
ments is between oceangoing vessels and aircraft.
</p>
<p>There are five principal modes of transportation available to users of transportation
services: (1) motor carrier, (2) rail, (3) air, (4) water, and (5) pipeline. A summary of
the major advantages and disadvantages of each is shown in Exhibit 17.5.

<p>Motor Carriers
The greatest competition between domestic transportation modes involves rail and
</p>
<p>motor carriers. The availability of modern trucking equipment, the advent of the U.S.
interstate highway system after World War II, and the inherent flexibility of motor
carriage has resulted in the rapid growth of motor transportation, much at the ex-
pense of rail carriers.
</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that over-the-road motor carriers are a popular trans-
portation option. They uniquely provide direct door-to-door service, making it a
highly flexible mode of transportation. In addition, motor carriers are ideal for carry-
ing smaller-volume, or less-than-truckload (LTL), shipments, involving multiple ship-
pers and multiple consignees. A well-established motor network exists for the
movement of LTL shipments throughout the United States, using a hub-and-spoke ar-
rangement, whereas it is far more difficult for a rail carrier to accommodate less-
than-carload shipments. Motor carriers also have an advantage of speed and reliabil-
ity over the other modes, particularly for full truckload shipments.
</p>
<p>The most significant disadvantage of a motor carrier is its relatively higher cost.
On average, motor carrier transportation is more expensive than rail on a volume ba-
sis and far more expensive than inland water. Also, motor carriers have limited abil-
ity to transport bulk commodities as compared to rail, inland water, and pipelines.
There are minimal economies of scale in motor carrier; you cannot simply add addi-
tional cargo-carrying capacity, because of weight, width, and length constraints.
</p>
<p>Motor carriers are characterized by higher variable costs (approximately 70&ndash;90%
of total cost) due to labor, fuel, maintenance, tolls, operating fees, and other costs re-
sulting from compliance with rules and regulations.5 A limit to the amount of weight
a motor carrier can transport at one time also makes variable costs higher. These lim-
its are often reduced as a result of seasonal weather conditions and the condition of
the infrastructure. Furthermore, each trailer, or tandem of trailers, requires a separate
power unit (tractor) and operator. A motor carrier does not have the volume flexibil-
ity of a rail carrier.
</p>
<p>Rail Carriers
A major advantage of a rail carrier is the wide range of items it is capable of haul-
</p>
<p>ing. Although most rail freight today consists of bulk commodities, such as coal, etha-
nol, and agricultural products, a railcar can handle virtually any type of shipment,
including manufactured goods. Another advantage of rail, and perhaps its primary
one, is its relatively low cost. The ability to move huge amounts of freight over long
distances at a per-pound cost that is lower than other transportation modes is the
main reason that rail still commands a large share of all intercity ton-mile shipments.
</p>
<p>The costs associated with owning and operating equipment, switch yards, and rail
line rights-of-way means that rail carriers have comparatively high fixed costs. How-
ever, their low variable cost structure allows rail carriers to move freight at a rela-
tively low rate per mile. Additional freight cars can be added to a freight train with
only a minimal increase in its total variable cost.
</p>
<p>Firms that rely on rail shipments must have access to a rail line or spur unless
they are willing to use motor carriers to perform pickup and delivery functions. This
constraint limits the use of rail in many instances and highlights perhaps the major
disadvantage of rail carriers&mdash;limited accessibility. Rail carriers have attempted to

<p>Chapter 17 Purchasing Services 633</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>overcome this inherent limitation through intermodal shipments involving shipping
truck trailers or containers directly on flat cars, which is also referred to as piggyback
service, a form of intermodalism.
</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of rail carriers, and one that motor carriers have successfully
exploited, is long in-transit and handling times. A two-day shipment by truck can often
take a week or more by rail. Few trains move as a single unit over long distances. Rail
carriers ship loaded cars between cities by attaching them to an outbound train moving
in the general direction of the consignee&rsquo;s facility. As such, a cross-country journey
may require several switches of a customer&rsquo;s railcar at various switching yards. Each
switch increases total shipping and handling time. At the destination city, a local train
moving only a few cars at a time makes the final delivery to the consignee.
</p>
<p>In recent years, the rail industry has engaged in significant consolidation and
merger activity, a process that has eliminated thousands of miles of track from the
rail system. In addition, less competitive rail companies have merged together to
share infrastructure and improve their operations and financial condition. There has
also been an increase in the number of smaller railroads that serve only limited re-
gions and lanes.
</p>
<p>Rail carriers will always be the mode of choice for certain commodities. Rail move-
ment is particularly economical for the shipment of agricultural products, output from
extractive industries (e.g., coal or chemicals), or products from heavy manufacturing in-
dustries, such as steel, agricultural equipment, and automobiles.
</p>
<p>Air Carriers
Air carriers haul the least amount of commercial freight because of the high cost
</p>
<p>of air travel and the limited amount and type of freight a plane can carry. Histori-
cally, a major reason for using air freight has been to satisfy emergency requirements.
For example, a mining machine breakdown overseas may require a replacement part
as soon as possible to get the equipment back into productive use. The buyer is less
concerned with the high cost of air freight when an expensive machine is sitting idle
because of a broken or defective part. In this case, an air carrier may be the only op-
tion capable of meeting the performance variable of speed. Plus, the shape of the air-
craft&rsquo;s fuselage limits the size and weight of the containers used.
</p>
<p>More firms are evaluating air transportation in relation to their just-in-time inven-
tory and manufacturing systems. Shipping a high-priced component via air may actu-
ally be a cost-effective option, particularly if the material does not require much
space, because of high inventory carrying costs. Some companies actually ship live lob-
sters or fresh-cut flowers via air to maintain their freshness. A significant amount of
competition for most traffic lanes exists among air carriers today, which supports
lower rates and increased service levels.
</p>
<p>Higher cost per pound is the primary disadvantage to the increased use of air trans-
portation. Air has a high variable-cost-to-fixed-cost ratio due to the high costs of oper-
ating a flight, such as fuel and labor. Because of the need to cover variable costs,
airfreight rates are much higher than other modes. Air carriers also suffer from lim-
ited capacity and flexibility. The dimensions of the plane itself limit the size and
weight of a shipment. In addition, if the airline has to make a decision on whether to
carry freight or take on another passenger, the freight will usually be off-loaded for a
later flight. Furthermore, the location of larger airports limits the shipping points

<p>available to an air carrier, unless a pickup-and-delivery network with motor carriers
is utilized. Once an air shipment arrives, a motor carrier almost always makes the fi-
nal delivery to the consignee.
</p>
<p>Water Carrier
This transportation mode includes both inland water (river, canal, and lake) and
</p>
<p>oceangoing vessels. Inland water carriers typically transport low-value, large-quantity
items such as bulk commodities and raw materials (e.g., ores, chemicals, sand, rocks,
cement, and agricultural products). For example, it is common to see freighters mov-
ing raw materials, such as coke and iron ore required for steel production, from Min-
nesota to steel mills in northwestern Indiana. This material moves via the Great
Lakes inland waterway system. However, this mode is closed down during the win-
ter, requiring large inventories to cover the season or the use of alternative modes.
</p>
<p>Inland water carriers rarely transport finished or semifinished products because of
the lengthy in-transit time. The main advantage of water transportation is the large
volume an inland barge or ship can move at one time, as well as the relatively low
cost per pound. The primary disadvantages include limited flexibility of shipping and
receiving points, seasonal shipment in some areas of the country, slow speed, and the
potential for natural disasters such as oil spills, which can have devastating effects on
the natural environment.
</p>
<p>Growth in international trade has increased the amount of freight moving on
oceangoing vessels. If a buyer purchases from an international supplier, the modal de-
cision is usually straightforward. Most global shipments move across the ocean on

</p>
<p>Maritime Supply
Chain Security
</p>
<p>Several government and industry initiatives have been introduced to improve the secu-
rity of the supply chain segment that deals with shipping containers that travel across the
waterways of the world. Many of the world&rsquo;s 2,700 container ships travel through the ports
of America each day, unloading more than 17,000 shipping containers. These containers
carry more than 80% of all U.S. imports.
</p>
<p>These shipping containers and ports must be protected to ensure the nation&rsquo;s security. A secu-
rity attack on a U.S. port would cost the economy several orders of magnitude (in billions of
dollars) more than the cost to prevent such an attack. Due to the sheer size and scope of mar-
itime shipping, any attack on the maritime supply chain would effectively suspend interna-
tional trade, while stopping or slowing shipping interests around the world.
</p>
<p>One of the most significant security programs is the Container Security Initiative (CSI). The
CSI is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection initiative that encourages foreign governments
to inspect and screen container shipments before leaving port to detect possible security prob-
lems. This program sets up the exchange of customs officers between countries so that out-
bound shipments will be inspected by that country&rsquo;s customs officers. The CSI focuses on 20
ports around the world where most imported products originate. The aim is to reduce the
risk of security problems on vessels and prevent an explosion or other incident in a port be-
fore the vessel can be unloaded. Once a vessel departs the originating port, security ini-
tiatives must be in place to prevent tampering with containers while in transit.

<p>deepwater containerships or tankers, and to a lesser extent via air carrier. Ocean car-
riers are capable of handling virtually any type of freight or raw material. Although
mode selection is usually not an issue for international ocean shipments, as in all stra-
tegic supplier selection decisions, carrier selection is still paramount. The possibility
of encountering customs delays due to increased security inspection and documenta-
tion requirements at ocean ports is another looming disadvantage of ocean carriers
(see Sourcing Snapshot: Maritime Supply Chain Security).
</p>
<p>Pipeline
The use of a pipeline is usually not part of the decision tradeoff between transporta-
</p>
<p>tion modes. Pipelines primarily transport petroleum products, natural gas, or coal in
a slurry condition. Even if a buyer purchases these products, it is not likely the buyer
will make the decision to use a pipeline for transportation. Because of the huge quanti-
ties involved, deciding on the use of pipeline is rarely something a buyer needs to con-
sider. Individual buyers will buy railcar or truckload quantities of these products
from a terminal, not directly from a pipeline. This discussion mentions pipeline only
because it is a legitimate mode of transportation.
</p>
<p>The total cost structure of pipelines is similar to rail carriers as the equipment,
rights-of-way, and physical pipeline have a high fixed cost and a low variable operat-
ing cost. Labor and direct operating costs are relatively low for this mode. Although
pipeline movement is low cost and reliable, it is extremely slow.
</p>
<p>In addition, an Automated Targeting System (ATS) is being put in place, whereby U.S. Cus-
toms requires shippers to send a detailed description of cargo being loaded on a vessel des-
tined for the United States at least 24 hours in advance of loading. Vessels will not be
allowed into U.S. ports without this advance notice. U.S. Customs and Border Protection uses
the ATS as an advanced screening tool to determine which potentially suspicious shipments
need to be inspected upon arrival.
</p>
<p>Finally, to increase security and improve the supply chain, the U.S. government is also encour-
aging companies to streamline their documentation and materials handling processes through
the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program. The C-TPAT is a pro-
gram for manufacturers, suppliers, importers, and carriers to analyze their own supply chain
security processes. It encourages them to improve supply chain security plans, communicate
security plans with their trading partners and suppliers, and monitor and improve security
measures on a routine basis. Once these companies are C-TPAT-certified by the U.S. govern-
ment, their products will be able to proceed through ports and border crossings more quickly.
They will also develop a closer working relationship with U.S. Customs and Border Protection
and other C-TPAT-certified companies. The U.S. C-TPAT program enables companies to avoid
increased transportation costs associated with border delays; reduce inventory needs by hav-
ing a secure, reliable supply chain; and improve supply chain relationships and communica-
tion between suppliers and customers. More than 500 companies have joined the C-TPAT
program to improve their supply chain security processes.

<p>Intermodal Transportation
Oftentimes, a single mode of transportation may prove inadequate for a specific
</p>
<p>shipment. For example, a typical surface shipment of material from China may re-
quire a variety of modes and carriers in order to complete the movement. Once the
material is produced in China, it will need to be loaded into a container, which is
then transported by either motor carrier or railroad to the port of departure. From
there, it will be loaded onto a deepwater containership. Once the containership docks
at the U.S. port of arrival, it will be loaded onto another motor carrier&rsquo;s or railroad&rsquo;s
equipment to be moved to its final destination. Note that each element in this com-
plex move may be performed by a different carrier.
</p>
<p>If the shipper or consignee were to deal individually with each mode and carrier,
the administrative cost and effort would be prohibitive and inefficient. To resolve this
complexity and provide better service, many global carriers now offer one-stop shop-
ping, where the shipper or consignee contracts with one carrier, which then co-
ordinates and manages the entire intermodal shipment, regardless of carrier or mode,
and also provides a single point of contact and unified freight bill. The underlying
idea of intermodal transportation is to utilize the inherent advantages of each mode
while minimizing their respective disadvantages, resulting in a seamless movement to
the customer.

<p>Exhibit 17.6 presents the relative ranking of the different transportation modes
against our five performance criteria. Examining the relative rankings from the chart,
it is easy to see why the popularity of motor carrier has increased with transportation

<p>and arranging shipment. Shippers can select a common (or public) carrier, negotiate
for services with a contract or exempt carrier, arrange shipments on company-owned ve-
hicles (private carrier), or use a third-party logistics provider to select and manage the
carrier. The most common decision is whether to use a common, contract, or exempt
carrier (see Exhibit 17.7).
</p>
<p>Common Carriers
By law, a common carrier must serve the general public without discrimination
</p>
<p>based on published rates for specific goods.6 Part of a common carrier&rsquo;s operating au-
thority comes from its obligation to serve transportation users in a fair and nondis-
criminatory manner. Besides its duty not to discriminate against transportation users,
a common carrier must offer reasonable rates, although rates are not published in
the same manner as they were during the days of economic regulation. A buyer decid-
ing to use a common carrier, particularly a motor carrier, often has a wide choice of
carriers within a geographic region. Examples of common carriers include Yellow,
J.B. Hunt, and Schneider National (recognized for its bright orange trucks).
</p>
<p>Contract Carriers
Shippers that rely heavily on precise and frequent transportation might consider
</p>
<p>the use of a contract carrier. A contract carrier does not hold itself out to serve the
general public, as does a common carrier. The contract carrier serves a shipper (i.e., a
buyer) under specific, negotiated contract terms. A contract carrier, sometimes re-
ferred to as a dedicated carrier, serves the transportation requirements of the party
with which it has a legal agreement and provides only those services that have been
negotiated with the shipper.
</p>
<p>Contract carriers can offer many benefits to the transportation buyer. Besides nego-
tiating a favorable rate based on frequency and volume, a buyer can usually receive a
higher level of service than might otherwise be expected because the carrier and ship-
per have a continuous contractual relationship.
</p>
<p>Private Carriers
A private carrier is a manufacturer or distributor that controls and manages its
</p>
<p>own transportation equipment, whether owned or leased. Typically, a private carrier
moves goods between suppliers, in-house facilities, or customers. Besides offering
greater control of its freight, a private carrier can increase the utilization of com-
pany-owned assets. Some companies operate their own private fleets to maintain deliv-
ery reliability or to more effectively manage those costs that outside carriers incur,
making them a better buyer of transportation services. Private carriers may also be uti-
lized to make daily &ldquo;milk runs,&rdquo; picking up smaller amounts of materials from close-
by suppliers to be used in a just-in-time environment.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest drawback to using a private fleet for inbound shipments is a
lack of dedication to this task. For example, it might be difficult to arrange shipments
from a supplier&rsquo;s facility on a regular basis using company-controlled vehicles. Practical
experience with a number of firms indicates the use of private carriers for inbound ship-
ments is the exception rather than the rule. When firms use a private carrier for receiv-
ing purchased items, it is usually the result of a geographically convenient arrangement
between a purchaser and supplier such as the milk runs described earlier. A company
operating a private fleet must ensure that it balances the utilization of its equipment

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>for both inbound and outbound shipments. Otherwise, empty miles reduce the cost-
effectiveness of operating a private fleet.
</p>
<p>Exempt Carriers
Exempt carriers are free of any economic regulation. They gain this status because
</p>
<p>of the type of commodities they haul and the nature of their operation. These car-
riers usually transport seasonal agricultural products, newspapers, livestock, or fish.
Exempt carriers are primarily local water carriers of bulk items. The presence of ex-
empt carriers ensures a supply of available transportation in markets where only one-
way traffic exists (e.g., from an agricultural area during the harvest season). Goods
move one way and not the other.
</p>
<p>Negotiate Transportation Rates and Service Levels
A buyer with substantial transportation needs across its supply chain will likely ne-
</p>
<p>gotiate directly with a single carrier or a small number of carriers for dedicated or con-
tracted services. This does not mean that buyers must negotiate only with contract
carriers. Negotiation can also occur with a common carrier, particularly regarding
transportation rates and service requirements.
</p>
<p>A major outcome from transportation economic deregulation has been the shift of
pricing information garnered from published tariffs and rate bureaus to the negotiat-
ing table. A buyer can negotiate specific services and required service levels, while the
carrier can indicate what freight volumes are necessary to support a particular service
level or rate. This negotiation process can address a number of topics:7
</p>
<p>&bull; The carrier&rsquo;s service performance guarantees with penalties and rewards
based on actual performance
</p>
<p>&bull; The shipper&rsquo;s commitment to ship a minimum amount of volume during
the life of the contract
</p>
<p>&bull; How the parties handle freight loss and damage claims
</p>
<p>&bull; The type and quantity of equipment utilized by the carrier
</p>
<p>&bull; Frequency and timing of shipments
</p>
<p>&bull; Establishment of information-sharing systems
</p>
<p>&bull; Freight rates and discounts
</p>
<p>&bull; Creative and innovative joint cost reduction activities
</p>
<p>A shipper does not necessarily negotiate a contract with every carrier it uses, particu-
larly if it is considered a small or infrequent shipper. A smart buyer, however, can
take advantage of the various opportunities offered in today&rsquo;s transportation environ-
ment by consolidating transportation volumes with fewer carriers to achieve shipping
economies of scale.
</p>
<p>Performance-Based Logistics8
Performance-based logistics (PBL) is an emerging collaborative business model
</p>
<p>that seeks to move away from the traditional transaction-based model toward meet-
ing the mutual interests of both the buyer and logistics service provider. Under the tra-
ditional transaction-based model, logistics service providers are typically compensated
for each and every transaction conducted, regardless of need. As such, there is lit-
tle motivation for the logistics service provider to become more efficient, as any

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>operational improvement negatively impacts its revenue stream. This business model
generally results in the lowest cost for each transaction but does not promote an effi-
cient, low-total-cost logistics system. Therefore, the underlying interests of the buyer
and logistics service provider are at odds with each other. In addition, the onus for
any cost and efficiency improvement is placed strictly on the buyer, who must then ne-
gotiate those improvements and revised pricing with the logistics service provider.
</p>
<p>In comparison, a performance-based logistics system seeks to drive the logistics ser-
vice provider&rsquo;s performance by clearly delineating the buyer&rsquo;s preferred outcomes,
not by transaction, but in terms of provider value added and overall systems cost. In
PBL, the logistics service provider is compensated by how well it enables the buyer to
achieve these outcomes. Compensation is structured to reward the logistics service
provider with longer-term contracts and performance incentives, leading to its in-
creased profitability. In order for PBL to work, both the buyer and logistics service
provider must explicitly agree as to what the buyer&rsquo;s desired outcomes, goals, and ob-
jectives are and on how the logistics service provider can help meet them.
</p>
<p>Following the determination of and agreement to the buyer&rsquo;s goals and objectives,
a key factor to consider here is the development of timely, accurate, and cost-effec-
tive metrics designed to measure key performance variables (i.e., who measures the lo-
gistics service provider&rsquo;s performance, how and where it is measured, and how often
it is measured).
</p>
<p>Use of PBL is not without its concerns. For example, performance measurement is
often difficult to define, let alone accomplish. There can be disagreement regarding
the buyer&rsquo;s perception of the logistics service provider&rsquo;s performance and the efficacy
of the metrics used to determine its level of performance. Research conducted by the
University of Tennessee indicates that total logistics system risk can actually be re-
duced for both buyer and logistics service provider through the collaboration made
possible by PBL.
</p>
<p>To date, the single largest proponent of PBL has been the U.S. Department of De-
fense (DoD), which uses PBL contracts to procure logistics support for its various ma-
jor weapons systems. Based on its previous successes with PBL, the DoD began
mandating its use in all of its major acquisition categories beginning in 2006. Perfor-
mance-based logistics offers significant promise in the private sector but has not yet
been widely adopted.
</p>
<p>However, a comparable sourcing strategy, service-level agreements (SLAs), has
been used in a number of spend categories, including travel and entertainment, soft-
ware and technology, and back-office operations. Application of an SLA allows the
buyer to specify target or minimum performance and service levels that the supplier
is expected to provide. As with PBL, the key is to develop key performance in-
dicators (KPIs) that outline specific performance criteria that a supplier is expected
to meet.
</p>
<p>An effective PBL system requires the logistics service provider to take a far more
proactive role in interacting with the buyer to jointly manage the buyer&rsquo;s supply
chain. Requirements for implementing a successful PBL project include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Commitment to mutual collaboration and alignment of interests
</p>
<p>&bull; Creation of a win-win environment for the buyer and logistics service pro-
vider, focused on the value added by the logistics service provider

<p>&bull; Application of an effective checks and balances system utilizing timely and
accurate data collection and multiple metrics, including a formal reporting
and review process9
</p>
<p>Outsourcing Logistics to Third-Party
Logistics Providers
</p>
<p>A buyer can initiate various actions to improve transportation service and delivery
performance throughout the supply chain. One of the most common actions is to out-
source logistics to a third-party logistics provider that is responsible for managing all
inbound and outbound transportation, as well as providing other logistics and ware-
housing services. The use of 3PLs is increasingly becoming an option for smaller ship-
pers and shipments. Third-party logistics providers can furnish convenient, low-cost,
and reliable transportation and logistics services, whereas the shipper may not have
sufficient volume for economies of scale or available expertise on staff. These service
providers also offer linked information systems that provide readily accessible visibil-
ity to their services, providing a substantial competitive advantage. For this reason,
many distributors and mail-order companies use FedEx and UPS as their primary
transportation provider as well as for other logistics services.
</p>
<p>Select Providers
Supply managers should be very careful in selecting 3PLs, which may pass them-
</p>
<p>selves off as &ldquo;integrated global logistics service providers,&rdquo; claiming to offer complete
end-to-end supply chain services even when they are not capable of doing so. In a
global marketplace, there are many different elements of transportation and logistics
that can be managed by a 3PL, including the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Customs brokers
</p>
<p>&bull; Freight brokers (both air and surface)
</p>
<p>&bull; Warehousing and distribution center operations
</p>
<p>&bull; Packaging and export documentation
</p>
<p>&bull; Delivery services
</p>
<p>&bull; Local sourcing and purchasing
</p>
<p>&bull; International trade management
</p>
<p>&bull; Global transportation optimization
</p>
<p>&bull; Supply chain planning
</p>
<p>&bull; Export packaging services
</p>
<p>It is rare in practice to find a 3PL company that is capable of providing world-
class services in all of these areas simultaneously. Therefore, supply management
should be leery of companies that claim that they are world-class providers in all of
these areas. To avoid selecting 3PL providers that cannot meet the shipper&rsquo;s require-
ments, savvy buyers should consider using the following approach:

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>When selecting qualified 3PLs, buyers should consider the following elements of
performance and determine whether a given provider can effectively execute them.
</p>
<p>Gain Access to Critical and Timely Data
Access to accurate and timely information represents power to a decision maker.
</p>
<p>It is difficult to manage material shipments without the ability to collect and analyze
critical transportation-related data. Ideally, the following logistics information should
be readily available and should be reported by the 3PL to the buyer. An inability to
quickly and accurately provide this information in a useable format may indicate that
the 3PL is not effectively managing the supply network.
</p>
<p>&bull; Number of carriers providing inbound, intraorganizational, and outbound
transportation services
</p>
<p>&bull; Total transportation expenditures by specific carrier and mode of
transportation
</p>
<p>&bull; Number of suppliers shipping material (i.e., the number of shipping points)
</p>
<p>&bull; Volume and transportation costs associated with shipments by supplier
</p>
<p>&bull; Breakdown of volumes by commodity or type of material
</p>
<p>&bull; Performance statistics and ratings for individual carriers
</p>
<p>&bull; Percentage of shipments arranged by suppliers versus buyers (e.g., FOB desti-
nation versus FOB origin)
</p>
<p>Develop Systems Visibility to Material Shipments
Up-to-the-minute information concerning the status and location of shipments
</p>
<p>can provide at least partial visibility that is required for total material control. The
need for control supports the development of electronic data and communications sys-
tems between carrier and buyer. Third-party logistics companies should be able to
provide immediate access to information on shipment status, whether on motor car-
riers linked electronically with shippers through global positioning systems or on a
ship, aircraft, or customs location.
</p>
<p>Many 3PLs offer detailed shipment tracking systems to provide current status up-
dates. Several levels of complexity exist in these systems. One-way information sys-
tems allow a buyer to gain information about the location of a shipment on a real-
time basis. A buyer simply requests data directly from a carrier&rsquo;s information system,
now often provided via the carrier&rsquo;s website.
</p>
<p>However, many 3PLs now utilize event-based systems. These provide status alerts,
via e-mail, fax, pager, and so on, to a buyer or salesperson that a particular shipment
has been delayed and that this may affect other entities in the supply chain (e.g.,
manufacturing plants, warehouse locations, and customers). Even though problematic
events cannot always be prevented, early warning signals, using an event-management
system, can help sourcing companies deal with the problem in a more timely manner.
</p>
<p>Develop Closer Relationships with Fewer Providers
A common theme throughout this book is that buyers and suppliers often benefit
</p>
<p>from closer, more collaborative relationships. This logic also applies to 3PL relation-
ships. Transportation buyers are increasingly reducing the number of 3PLs they do

<p>business with on a companywide basis with the intention of working more collabora-
tively with the remaining ones. This allows a buyer to realize improved service and
greater benefits that otherwise might not be available through a traditional, arm&rsquo;s-
length business relationship. For example, a buyer may receive a guarantee that car-
rier equipment will be available when and where needed. Controlling and managing
the movement of goods is easier and more efficient when a buyer selects only the
best 3PLs available and develops a closer working relationship with them.
</p>
<p>Establish Companywide Contracts
Real and substantial cost and service benefits are possible when transportation vol-
</p>
<p>umes between facilities, divisions, or business units are combined for increased pur-
chasing leverage and put under the jurisdiction of a limited number of highly capable
3PLs and/or 4PLs. An example of such a relationship is discussed in Sourcing Snap-
shot: GM Develops Vector as Its Fourth-Party Logistics Provider.

<p>GM Develops Vector as
Its Fourth-Party Logistics
Provider
</p>
<p>To deal with increased complexity in a build-to-order environment, GM sought a fourth-
party logistics (4PL) partner within the logistics industry for the following reasons:
</p>
<p>&bull; Avoid/defer structural or fixed costs, and drive more costs to variable
&bull; Gain access to specialized logistics resources
&bull; Rapidly develop and deploy cutting-edge IT logistics solutions
&bull; Provide a single point of organizational accountability responsible for managing lo-
</p>
<p>gistics activities
</p>
<p>A 4PL is a distinctive business model that extends outsourcing to new levels as it combines
the best capabilities and technologies from logistics companies and other service organiza-
tions to deliver value through total supply chain management. Selecting a non-asset-based
provider that is neutral with respect to selecting logistics shippers and materials manage-
ment providers is a must.
</p>
<p>GM&rsquo;s supply chains were integrated with logistics processes and IT management controlled
by a 4PL, leveraging multiple service providers. Why was it important for GM to go with a
4PL? To reduce the cost of GM&rsquo;s huge logistics network, which includes raw materials provid-
ers (such as steel), customs brokers, third-party logistics providers, first- and second-tier
component suppliers, freight forwarders, assembly operations, original equipment manu-
facturers, distribution centers, new vehicle dealers, parts and service dealers, and third-
party logistics distributors of aftermarket parts. Looking at this hugely complex network,
GM&rsquo;s logistics team realized that nobody can do it all and that GM wasn&rsquo;t capable of manag-
ing this network themselves either. To cope with this complexity, GM signed a contract with
CNF to form a 4PL joint venture called Vector SCM. GM will be able to do the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Retain strategic planning, benchmarking, and operational competency
&bull; Have board representation and super-majority rights on critical issues
&bull; Reduce logistics costs through a gain share agreement
&bull; Avoid significant IT development costs

<p>One clear trend is that many carriers no longer market themselves simply as pro-
viders of physical transportation services. For complex freight movements&mdash;those
movements involving multiple parties or additional handling&mdash;many carriers now per-
form those duties that previously required the use of in-house personnel or third
parties. Full-service providers, in addition to picking up and delivering goods, may
consolidate shipments, provide simplified billing, ship just-in-time from local storage
points, handle complex overseas shipments, coordinate shipments with other carriers
or modes, or configure final products for direct shipment to end customers. This al-
lows a transportation buyer to focus on strategy development while the full-service
carrier manages the mundane details of the transportation network.
</p>
<p>There are many examples of using service providers for more than just transporta-
tion. UPS handles all the worldwide aftermarket spare parts business for Allison En-
gine. Burlington Air Express has reduced a computer company&rsquo;s order-cycle time by
warehousing its inventory, configuring PCs with the correct software, and delivering
directly to customers. Internet services provided by carriers are expanding as well.
Most overnight package delivery companies provide full tracking of packages via soft-
ware that allows users to arrange for, track, and complete entire shipping transac-
tions over the Internet.
</p>
<p>Purchasing Services and Indirect Items10
Over the past several years, supply management departments in high-performing,
</p>
<p>best-in-class companies have made great strides in reducing the price of direct mate-
rial inputs. Because procurement of direct materials is often associated with distinct
strategic business units (SBUs), managing this spend is usually accomplished through
centralized commodity groups, with sourcing decisions and contract administration
</p>
<p>Vector will do the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Manage GM&rsquo;s current global network of logistics service providers
&bull; Manage GM&rsquo;s global tactical and operational logistics activities
&bull; Enable logistics capabilities (visibility, speed, flexibility, and reliability)
&bull; Provide best-of-breed logistics technology
&bull; Provide people, process, and technology to support GM global logistics operations
&bull; Partner with leaders in the industry to build, buy, or leverage skills and
</p>

</p>
<p>GM and Vector SCM have created common global solutions across logistics networks through
the use of regional Logistics Control Centers. Vector assumed the responsibility of managing
approximately one third of GM&rsquo;s logistics spend. The gradual transition of responsibility to Vec-
tor SCM is well under way, managed through a disciplined business case process, involving
discovery of opportunities, business case development, implementation, and business case ap-
proval. This has required major changes in the way that GM works and allows it to focus on
its core competency of designing and building value for the end customer in the form of new
vehicles and services.

aged effectively.
</p>
<p>We can define indirect spend as any purchased good or service that does not end
up in the product or service delivered to a customer. This component can be a signifi-
cant percentage of a company&rsquo;s expenditures. Research on Fortune 500 companies
found that services spending accounted for 11% of total revenue and 30% of total pur-
chase spend. Indirect spending averaged 9% of revenue and 23% of total purchases.
By comparison, direct spending (where the attention of supply management is most
often focused) accounted for 18% of total revenue and 44% of total purchase spend.
Another important indicator was that participants expected services spend to in-
crease by 13% in the next five years, an indication that the Western world is out-
sourcing more and more activities to external service organizations. A breakout of
the average percentage of total purchasing spending by category is provided in Ex-
hibit 17.9.
</p>
<p>With continued growth in outsourcing of non&ndash;core capabilities, the expansion of
the services sector, and increasing cost pressure, the importance of effectively manag-
ing an organization&rsquo;s indirect spend is increasing. However, due to the decentralized
nature and wide variety of goods and services in most indirect spend categories, the
problem is more complex from a managerial and administrative standpoint. Issues of-
ten arise in segmenting or allocating indirect spend across or between different func-
tional and budgetary areas. Another common problem is that indirect spend is often

<p>hidden in the price of direct materials (e.g., FOB destination). For example, if a sup-
plier pays for shipping, the transportation cost (an indirect service) is buried in the
cost of the direct material.
</p>
<p>The CAPS Research Critical Issues Report referred to above found that companies
have begun using two distinct methods to identify, manage, and reduce their indirect
spend: internal and external methods. An overview of these results is provided as
follows.
</p>
<p>Internal Methods of Managing Indirect Spend
</p>
<p>Data Collection and Consolidation
In many cases, several units within one organization will unknowingly purchase
</p>
<p>the same goods and services from different suppliers (or even the same supplier at dif-
ferent prices). For example, John Deere discovered that it was spending $1.4 million
annually on work gloves. This total was represented by 425 separate part numbers
purchased from 20 different suppliers. In some instances, a single supplier was supply-
ing the same glove to different Deere manufacturing and distribution facilities at dis-
parate prices. Research showed that consolidating and standardizing this indirect
purchase alone with a few well-chosen suppliers would result in an annual savings of
$500,000.11 In this situation, Deere encountered higher costs by not leveraging its to-
tal volume enterprisewide.
</p>
<p>If indirect spend is to be leveraged, supply management must have a clear under-
standing of exactly what indirect goods and services are being purchased by individ-
ual SBUs. As Deere&rsquo;s work glove example above shows, there are many indirect
purchases in a typical organization that are not recognized as having volume leverage
opportunity. Comprehensive data collection and focused analysis allow companies to
maximize leverage in their indirect spend and also recognize comparable goods or ser-
vices that might be standardized and aggregated.
</p>
<p>For example, FedEx contracted with a firm specializing in electricity usage audits
to collect billing information from each of its 2,000 facilities and review whether the
correct tariff rates were used for each facility. These facilities varied in size from over
10,000 employees to as few as 2 and were located in every state. Based on this
approach alone, eliminating overbilling errors from improperly applied utility rates
yielded a savings of from 4 to 5% of its energy spend after all consulting fees have
been paid. The most important component of this strategy was not the upfront cost
savings as much as it was determining the overall pattern and volume of electricity
consumption across this network of facilities. Once this pattern of consumption was
identified and understood, FedEx could initiate a strategy for rationalizing its energy
spend in accordance with varying deregulation patterns across the different states. In
addition, FedEx was able to modify business processes at its stations and hubs to im-
prove electricity usage efficiency.12
</p>
<p>Restructuring to Establish Accountability
Establishing a capable supply management structure and setting up accountability
</p>
<p>for indirect purchases are closely connected with data collection, consolidation, and anal-
ysis. By gaining a clear understanding of who is spending what, where, and when, sup-
ply management can implement procedures and safeguards that deter and control
maverick spend. Maverick spend can be defined as that amount of an organization&rsquo;s

<p>total procurement budget that is purchased from unauthorized sources. Here is where
the supply management organization&rsquo;s delegation of responsibility for cost saving oc-
curs: A chain of command is established that matches appropriate procurement author-
ity and ensures that the correct protocol is followed (see Sourcing Snapshot: FedEx
Uses Elance to Purchase Services).
</p>
<p>Automating the Requisition/Sourcing Process
Companies have improved their sourcing process by using electronic requisition-
</p>
<p>ing and automating routing, approvals, and purchase order/release creation. Such au-
tomation also facilitates the receiving function by automatically checking receipts
against both the supplier&rsquo;s invoice and the buyer&rsquo;s purchase order. Finally, once the
supply or service has been delivered or provided and is considered complete, the auto-
mated process also authorizes the payment, oftentimes an electronic transfer of funds
transaction, which saves both the buyer and supplier time and money. A Miller Brew-
ing executive pointed out, &ldquo;This allows procurement managers more time to focus on
the strategic areas of buying rather than having to worry about the mundane tasks as-
sociated with the various buying procedures.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Standardization
Supporting an automated sourcing system with e-catalogs helps to promote item
</p>
<p>standardization and aggregation of indirect spend. By limiting internal requisitioners to

<p>FedEx Uses Elance to
Purchase Services
</p>
<p>FedEx Corporation throws all its weight into negotiating prices with the 15 firms that
provide it with temporary worker services, telephone customer service representatives, and
computer programmers. So it was with some dismay that Edith Kelly-Green, FedEx&rsquo;s chief
sourcing officer, realized managers were doing end runs around its paper-logged purchasing
department, striking independent deals with contractors, in many cases without the dis-
counts that FedEx was supposed to incur. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing to select suppliers and another to
make sure employees actually use them,&rdquo; says Kelly-Green.
</p>
<p>To deal with this maverick spending problem, FedEx began using spend management soft-
ware from Elance to automate the hiring, paying, and discharging of temporary employees.
By keeping managers wedded to previously negotiated contracts and reducing paperwork,
FedEx expects to save between 10 and 15% of its multibillion-dollar annual services budget.
Although services typically account for more than half of a business&rsquo;s purchasing ex-
penditures, fewer than 10% of large companies have installed software to track and man-
age what they spend on services. The big temporary-employee firms, like Manpower and Kelly
Services, offer their own internally developed programs. Also competing with Elance is Cascade-
Works, which has partnered with Ariba and White Amber. These firms claim to be able to trim
between 2 and 35% off temporary-employee expenditures by tracking time cards, keeping tabs
on laptops and other company property that temporary employees receive, and allowing super-
visors to evaluate both contract laborers and their agencies.

<p>and approved suppliers, volume commitments to approved suppliers can be achieved
and maverick spending reduced. Some companies have gone so far as to establish poli-
cies that require every indirect goods purchase made off-catalog to be submitted to an
executive for review and approval. This visibility is essential in minimizing unautho-
rized purchases from nonapproved sources.
</p>
<p>External Methods of Managing Indirect Spend
</p>
<p>Reverse Auctions
The use of reverse auctions is increasing and can greatly impact the indirect buying
</p>
<p>process. This method of managing indirect spend is projected to increase 10 to 15%
per year in the foreseeable future. Among the many reasons for this is that electronic re-
verse auctions allow buyers and suppliers to easily communicate in real time from any-
where in the world via the Internet. Buyers have indicated they are seeing an average
price savings of 10 to 20%. However, many buyers are beginning to question the sustain-
ability of such cost savings over time once the initial reductions are made.
</p>
<p>Purchasing Consortia
Another growing trend for improving buyers&rsquo; leverage is the use of purchasing con-
</p>
<p>sortia, which are created by buyers from various businesses to pool their buying
power in order to reduce prices. Some companies, such as Raytheon, have been so suc-
cessful at building and managing their purchasing consortia that they generate reve-
nue by charging other businesses a service fee for using them. However, one of the
challenges faced by purchasing consortia is getting the individual members to agree
on exactly what is to be collectively purchased. Because of these coordination difficul-
ties, purchasing consortia are often run by an independent third party, which takes
all of the different specifications and develops a joint product list that it feels best
matches the needs of all the participants.
</p>
<p>Supply Management Outsourcing
Some companies have decided to outsource their indirect spend altogether. For ex-
</p>
<p>ample, Harley-Davidson wanted to better manage its indirect spend, but instead of
managing this process internally, it decided to outsource all indirect purchases to
three reliable suppliers. To do this, Harley-Davidson&rsquo;s supply management depart-
ment conducted a lengthy search for those outstanding suppliers thought to be able
to handle this responsibility. These three suppliers then became responsible for mak-
ing sure that all indirect sourcing needs were met, either internally or by procuring
externally from another supplier. This saved Harley-Davidson over $4 million in sav-
ings in its first year of implementation.
</p>
<p>Enabling Tactics and Strategies
The previously mentioned CAPS report notes that several enablers are necessary
</p>
<p>to successfully implement an indirect spend procurement strategy. These are dis-
cussed below.
</p>
<p>Zero-Based Budgeting

<p>typically decentralized throughout the organization. In addition, traditional cost ac-
counting systems are not designed to systematically track and consolidate indirect
spend across an organization. This approach forces business units to start with and
justify the same indirect budget they had in the previous planning cycle. Once this is
prepared, supply management examines the spend categories and looks for cost-sav-
ings opportunities. If opportunities are found and result in lower-cost purchases, the
business unit must write a check to the CFO for the amount of the savings.
</p>
<p>Prebudget Savings
Another approach to capturing negotiated savings in the indirect spend is the use
</p>
<p>of forced budget reductions. Several companies stated that they forced 5 to 10% bud-
get reductions on all indirect items. Business units then had the following option:
</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiating price reductions on current volumes
</p>
<p>&bull; Aggregating spend within or across business units to gain additional
volume-based price concessions
</p>
<p>&bull; Decreasing demand for indirect items
</p>
<p>&bull; Using a combination of the above methods
</p>
<p>Organizational Structure
The debate about centralized, decentralized, and hybrid supply management orga-
</p>
<p>nizations was discussed earlier in Chapter 5. In many cases, however, it appears that
a hybrid organization will allow different regions or business units the flexibility to
make their own localized procurement decisions and be a good fit with the indirect
sourcing needs of most large organizations.

<p>Bayer Attacks Indirect
Spend
</p>
<p>In addressing concerns over its indirect spend, Bayer initiated a program it called the
&ldquo;Money Room.&rdquo; This involved establishing money room centers in plants or administration
units that act as control centers for the supply management department. Indirect spend is
typically mapped out into 20 to 25 areas (in columns) and linked to days of the month (in
rows). All requests for materials are sent daily to these centers, where they are charted. At
any given time, money room personnel meet to discuss that day&rsquo;s requisitions. If the requisi-
tions meet that day&rsquo;s target spend and no foreseeable savings can be made, the orders are
placed. If the day&rsquo;s requisition exceeds the approved target, control personnel are responsi-
ble for finding ways of reducing, mitigating, or eliminating the projected spend. This can be
done by consolidating SKUs for more leverage, delaying purchases, or whatever other means
seems reasonable. Control personnel are expected to bring costs down to 80% of historical
numbers and are rotated every three to four months to bring fresh ideas to the program. At
one location, Bayer reports that the money room program has saved more than 46% on indi-
rect spend!

<p>Integrating Accounts Payable into Supply Management
Several companies have integrated their accounts payable processes into the supply
</p>
<p>management organization, addressing one of the more pressing challenges associated
with indirect spend, namely contract compliance. This arrangement gives supply man-
agement the authority to not pay for indirect items that were bought off-contract. To
have the bill paid, the business unit is forced to speak to the CFO, an embarrassing
and rarely repeated process, thereby effectively controlling maverick spending.
</p>
<p>Power Spenders
This represents those key individuals or units that control substantial indirect
</p>
<p>spending and that typically have positions of great authority within the organization.
Due to their authority and the sheer volume of the indirect spend they control, sup-
ply management often has a hard time getting these power spenders to comply with
organizationwide supply management policies. Several companies indicate that prop-
erly training these power users is key to controlling their indirect spend. Training of-
ten includes information on general strategic sourcing strategies, as well as specific
information on the strategies and tools employed by supply management for effec-
tively controlling the indirect spend. Once trained, enlightened power spenders are
usually more willing to comply with pre-established supply management contracts
and play an appropriate role in managing their indirect spending.
</p>
<p>Supplier-Managed E-Catalogs
E-catalogs, coupled with automated requisitioning and supply management sys-
</p>
<p>tems described earlier in the chapter, help organizations ensure greater compliance
with existing contracts. However, most companies indicate that creating and maintain-
ing current in-house e-catalogs can be extremely costly and difficult. In general, sup-
pliers should provide and manage the e-catalogs, as they have a vested interest in
doing so to create additional sales volume.
</p>
<p>Commodity Coding for Indirect Spend
Assigning and maintaining accurate and representative commodity codes for indi-
</p>
<p>rect goods and services across an enterprise can prove extremely difficult. Indirect
goods can often be logically coded into different expense categories, leading to incon-
sistent coding across units, individual purchases, or perhaps even no coding at all
(e.g., indirect expenses are put into a generic catch-all account such as Freight In).
Supplier coding is also a challenge. Suppliers of multiple indirect items can often
have multiple ship-to and bill-to addresses, resulting in multiple codes being assigned
to the same supplier for the same item. Many suppliers will simply code these dispa-
rate purchases with the same accounting information, effectively masking them from
detailed analysis and effective cost management by the indirect buyer. This also dis-
guises the total indirect spend with a given supplier and hinders the buyer from fully
leveraging its volume. To help counter these problems, companies should limit their
commodity coding system to a few levels of detail, which makes it easier for the end
user to properly identify commodity purchases and reduce the time for determining
the perfect code.
</p>
<p>One Commodity Team Assigned to Large Suppliers
There can be many challenges when sourcing from large suppliers with a broad and
</p>
<p>diverse product offering. These include commodity coding as well as standardizing

<p>products, pricing, terms, and conditions. One effective solution is to assign a designated
commodity team to work with each large supplier. When another buyer is considering
using this supplier, a commodity team member already assigned to this supplier is con-
sulted to ensure that existing contracts with the appropriate standardized products,
pricing, terms, and conditions are used. This collaborative approach helps the buy-
ing company counter the common divide-and-conquer strategy often used by large
suppliers.
</p>
<p>Outsourcing Indirect Sourcing
Although outsourcing any part of a supply management organization can be contro-
</p>
<p>versial, it can often return significant benefits. For example, one company decided to
outsource its nonstrategic indirect spend. This bold move had a number of benefits.
The first benefit was the development of an up-to-date e-catalog that was implemented
quickly. The second was tighter control of the organization&rsquo;s indirect spend accompa-
nied by real-time data. The third was a substantial reduction in the cost of indirect
goods and services. And lastly, the company was able to reduce its headcount.
</p>
<p>Sourcing Professional Services13
In this section, we will review best practices in an area of service procurement fac-
</p>
<p>ing increasing scrutiny: the sourcing of professional services, including consultants and
software development. In buying professional services, incorporating such basic steps
as rationalizing and optimizing the supply base, working hand in hand with key suppli-
ers, leveraging volume across business units, implementing better control systems, and
developing cost savings ideas can save companies a substantial amount of money.14
</p>
<p>Although implementation of these strategies can prove crucial in any typical sourc-
ing scenario, its significance in the cost-effective procurement of professional services
is further enhanced by the fact that professional services are often used quite differ-
ently among departments or business units. Like many other areas of supply man-
agement, the first step should be to perform an internal audit to establish a baseline
of just how much the company is currently spending on professional services and
where those funds are actually spent. An effective audit process should examine ex-
penditure records to get an approximate estimate of the total value of these services.
The audit team should then reclassify these expenditures by description, supplier,
and internal user. It should also review the recent procurement history for previously
contracted professional services.15 This determines the current state of the profes-
sional services sourcing process and allows the company to decide if it requires
change. In addition, the following steps are recommended for buying professional ser-
vices, such as outside consulting.
</p>
<p>Have a Clearly Defined Scope
Every project must have a scope that succinctly defines the project to help avoid
</p>
<p>misunderstandings between the buyer and the service provider. At a minimum, the
scope should provide detailed guidance to the service provider, including project de-
liverables, milestones and deadlines, and budget. The scope should also include
whether rewards and penalties are appropriate and how risk is to be distributed be-
tween the parties as well as instructions describing how major scope changes are to
be handled to ensure that what was contracted for actually gets accomplished and to

</p>
<p>Chapter 17 Purchasing Services 653</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>avoid scope creep. In some cases, it may be advisable to renegotiate the agreement if
the desired changes are too substantial and materially alter the intent of the original
agreement. The scope also needs to include nondisclosure statements to protect the
buying company&rsquo;s interest. The buyer may want to insert language that specifies the
actual persons who are supposed to do the work. Finally, the scope needs to include
statements as to who has operational control over both internal and external project
personnel once the contract is signed.
</p>
<p>It is a good idea that, when using a new professional services supplier, the buyer
should develop a very detailed project scope. However, if the buyer is using a previ-
ously established or preferred supplier, the scope of the new project may be more lim-
ited because the buyer already has a long-term relationship with the service provider.
This relationship allows for work to be released with only a phone call or e-mail mes-
sage. However, even with an established service provider, it is always important to
follow up with a written confirmation outlining the understanding of the project,
although a highly detailed document may not be necessary.
</p>
<p>Move to a Centralized Procurement Structure
Moving to a centralized process for procuring professional services allows the buy-
</p>
<p>ing company to leverage its corporate buying power to ensure they are sourcing the
highest-quality service at the most cost-effective price.16 According to Anne Millen
Porter, &ldquo;Cost reduction is, hands down, the main reason for bringing sizeable purchas-
ing power to bear in the market place.&rdquo;17 For example, Dial saved $100 million over
five years, including $10 million in 2001, by moving to centralized sourcing.18 After
San Diego Gas and Electric centralized its procurement process, it found many posi-
tive results including greater objectivity, improved negotiation, and better pricing.19
</p>
<p>Centralization of professional service procurement can also increase the account-
ability of outside consultants to the buyer by increasing the monitoring and auditing
of services provided. Centralized procurement often leads to the ability to reduce the
number of professional service providers, thus gaining additional pricing leverage
with each. Additionally, centralization can also reduce service provider redundancy
and reduce likelihood of unnecessary charges.20 Another advantage of centralized pro-
curement for professional services is that it reduces the risk of business units purchas-
ing duplicated services.
</p>
<p>Although utilizing a centralized procurement process has all of the advantages dis-
cussed above, it does have disadvantages. One major disadvantage is that no single
consultant is likely to be the expert in a variety of consulting projects, so having a de-
centralized approach can help tailor the sourcing of professional services to better fit
specific needs. Therefore, many companies feel that decentralized procurement of pro-
fessional services is better for highly diversified companies with many business units.
</p>
<p>Develop a Professional Services Database
In order for a professional services database solution to be effective, it should in-
</p>
<p>clude the following two databases.
</p>
<p>A Cumulative Knowledge Database
A cumulative knowledge database is vital in preventing the sourcing of duplicate
</p>
<p>or redundant professional services by different departments or business units. In gen-
eral, this database should contain an organized listing of results obtained from past

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>projects, including but not be limited to user satisfaction level, timely project comple-
tion, work quality, accuracy of work delivered, and affordability. This database is use-
ful because it allows employees to search past projects to see if a similar solution has
already been delivered. If a similar solution is available on the database, redundant ser-
vices may not be needed, unless conditions have changed significantly. This increased
project record keeping will ultimately save the company a significant amount in profes-
sional service expenditures.
</p>
<p>A Preferred Supplier List Database
This database, including supplier performance records and related user comments,
</p>
<p>can be extremely useful for companies considering multiple professional service pro-
viders. By having access to a list of preferred suppliers, employees know which profes-
sional service providers the company recommends. These recommendations can be
determined by user satisfaction ratings, the existence of long-term contracts, or price
discounts. In any event, the preferred supplier list must be easily accessible by employ-
ees when they search for suppliers on new projects.
</p>
<p>The database should also be set up to generate a list of preferred suppliers based
on previous project performance criteria. For example, the Intelli-Gage system at Mer-
rill Lynch is designed so that hiring managers can select desired skills from a compre-
hensive menu of options. Once a search request is completed, the database then
provides a prioritized list of appropriate or preferred candidates. The system should
also display the supplier&rsquo;s most recent hourly rate and fee structure, as well as other
useful information such as performance ratings and previous project user comments.
According to Merrill Lynch, &ldquo;The ability to track the consultant&rsquo;s performance is an
enormous benefit for companies with multiple locations and multiple information
technology organizations around the globe. In addition, the system&rsquo;s ability to track
individual supplier performance, as well as overall supplier performance, allows us to
prevent hiring poor performers who leave one supplier company only to resurface un-
der a different corporate umbrella.&rdquo;21
</p>
<p>As long as the preferred supplier database is meticulously maintained, and employ-
ees are encouraged to use the preferred supplier list, companies should see improve-
ments in their procured services. Moreover, as new and refined search criteria come
along, it is important that these criteria be added to the database. This will allow
sourcing managers to easily walk through menus to populate future supplier searches.
Performance records, supplier evaluations, and project comments will also need to be
continually updated in a timely manner for the database to remain effective. Together,
these IT elements should enhance the organization and efficiency of the supply manage-
ment department.
</p>
<p>Develop a Sound Procedure for Evaluation
and Selection of Consultants
</p>
<p>One of the most important functions in procurement is the initial evaluation and
selection of consultants and other professional service providers. As such, buyers of-
ten commit major resources to perform initial supplier evaluations. Although there
are different requirements for each performance area, it is typical to evaluate such
areas as supplier quality, cost competitiveness, potential delivery performance, and
technological capability. To help avoid potential bias, it is essential that a cross-

<p>functional team carry out this analysis. Companies report cost savings in the range of
15&ndash;25% by utilizing a cross-functional team.
</p>
<p>Optimize the Supply Base
Once the first cut has eliminated those professional service providers that are not
</p>
<p>capable of performing the desired work, the buyer must decide how to evaluate the re-
maining suppliers, some of which may appear equally capable on the surface. This
procedure includes an evaluation drawn from supplier interviews and conversations,
as well as the use of a preferred supplier list as discussed before. A preferred supplier
list can designate whether a professional service provider&rsquo;s capabilities and quality
meet the highest performance and service standards as defined by the users. This list
may also take into account any price discount or volume-leveraging opportunities of-
fered by the supplier. Such a list helps to monitor the performance of selected suppli-
ers closely, facilitates organizational visibility in the long run, and avoids duplication
of efforts to re-evaluate the supplier. This information is a key input in the knowl-
edge database. The buyer and supplier should conduct detailed negotiations to agree
upon the specific details of the agreement that can be included in the scope of work.
</p>
<p>Although it is important to develop a rationalized supply base so that buying
power can be appropriately leveraged, a single-source strategy rarely maximizes the
value of professional services. Often the addition of a single new supplier will greatly
enhance the performance of the others because of the added competition. Using multi-
ple sources for products encourages professional service providers to act more compet-
itively. Although no single supplier should be considered an expert in all areas, using
a variety of sources allows managers to find and tap specific expertise for a given proj-
ect. Use of multiple sources also increases the flow of new ideas and information and
reduces the dependence on any single supplier. Additionally, all efforts should be
taken to avoid one-stop shopping; most service companies are second rate outside
their core businesses. Use professional service providers for their core expertise only.
</p>
<p>Develop a Standardized Contract
It is critical for supply managers to develop skills and abilities to understand and
</p>
<p>manage professional service contracts on a regular basis. It is also important for a
standard contract template/format to be developed in association with the organiza-
tion&rsquo;s legal department. Some companies have created an online contract template
where all the standard professional service clauses are built in. The entire scope of
the project should be clearly and succinctly defined at this level, with emphasis on
the various sections of the project scope as additional clauses in the contract. These
should include project deliverables, deadlines and milestones, and budget. If a com-
pany utilizes an incentive system to reward or penalize its professional service provid-
ers, this should also become part of the final agreement. Finally, the contract should
contain a clause that allows for renegotiation in case of major scope changes.
</p>
<p>Monitor Results
The company should have a predetermined methodology to gauge the perfor-
</p>
<p>mance of its professional service providers at various stages of their projects. The
parameters on which the supplier is evaluated should include, but not be limited
to, quality, cost management, delivery, technical support, and wavelength. Wavelength
can be defined as how easy the professional service provider is to do business with.

<p>The results of service provider performance evaluations should be entered into the
knowledge database in a timely manner, enabling retrieval both at the time of sup-
plier evaluation and after supplier selection.
</p>
<p>The internal customers of any contracted professional service (i.e., the users who
are directly impacted), should have an active role in the sourcing and evaluation pro-
cess. Their participation in defining the detailed scope of the project and providing rel-
evant feedback on services rendered by the service provider should be consistently
updated in the knowledge database throughout the life cycle of the project. Finally,
the company should monitor its expenses, utilizing an information systems tool
where available.
</p>
<p>Develop Policy Compliance
For the execution of best practices into a systematic professional services procure-
</p>
<p>ment process, the prerequisites are mentioned above. The degree of success for imple-
mentation and ongoing management of this process will depend not only upon how
comprehensive and exhaustive these practices and policies are for a given company but
also on whether adequate buy-in has been obtained from affected employees and inter-
nal stakeholders. Top management should consider this completely before defining the
final scope of the procurement project. Because the maintenance of best practices is a
highly dynamic process, the organization&rsquo;s information systems and knowledge data-
bases should be checked for the most recent updates.
</p>
<p>The Procurement Governance Team at Allstate reduced the number of suppliers
for one type of professional service from 300 to 11, resulting in a 20% cost reduction.
The procurement team handles the complete sourcing process from beginning to
end, allowing employees to concentrate on their core responsibilities. This also per-
mits the organization to operate more efficiently and receive a greater benefit. Accord-
ing to the vice president and head of procurement governance, effective demand
management of professional services depends on establishing clear usage policies,
then monitoring and reporting compliance with these policies. Realizing actual sav-
ings requires compliance throughout the entire company.22
</p>
<p>Service Supply Chain Challenges
Research indicates that effectively managing an organization&rsquo;s services supply
</p>
<p>chain is fraught with challenges.23 Many service sourcing agreements are character-
ized by imprecise and unclear specifications. Without clear and concise specifications,
it is unlikely that a buyer can properly determine whether a service has been per-
formed to the satisfaction of the internal customer. Not having a well-thought-out
and thoroughly defined set of performance and outcome expectations can lead to re-
duced customer satisfaction with the user. Secondly, in trying to write out specific ser-
vice requirements, many buyers and users find out that clear and accurate service
specifications are very difficult to delineate; for example, what determines satisfactory
progress on the development of a software program?
</p>
<p>Likewise, service providers can often take advantage of unsuspecting buyers when
service performance specifications are unclear or ill-defined. More than one service
provider has been able to expand the scope of a contract (and its corresponding fees)
through change orders. Without exception, scope creep unfairly favors the service

</p>
<p>Good Practice
Example
</p>
<p>Bank of America&rsquo;s
Document Management
Services
</p>
<p>Bank of America (BoA) is one of the world&rsquo;s leading financial services companies. BoA
serves 28 million customers and clients from its 4,200 banking centers. These centers are lo-
cated in more communities across the country than any other U.S. bank. Bank of America
also provides corporate financial services to more than 90% of U.S. Fortune 500 companies
through offices in 30 countries around the world.
</p>
<p>Bank of America chose a unique approach to documents and created a Document Manage-
ment department charged with oversight for the entire document life cycle, from conception
to end-of-life functions, including archiving, recycling, and confidential destruction. This
group approached reducing the end-to-end cost of documents with a methodology that be-
gan with capturing the document in a digital library that was tied to a relational database
that stored the pertinent approval and production specifications of that document. Around
that dual database, the Document Management group developed a disciplined change con-
trol process that mandated a review of compliance issues and opportunities to reduce the
end-to-end cost of delivery. They then categorized all potential delivery channels, including
document production and distribution, through warehousing, print-on-demand, distribute and
print-on-demand, desktop delivery through multifunctional devices, desktop printers, repro-
graphic networks, fax machines, and Internet delivery. Distribution expense contributed an
ever larger percentage to the end-to-end cost, so there was an increased focus on distribu-
tion cost, freight, expedited delivery, postal expense, and interoffice mail costs.
</p>
<p>This approach had some significant implications for the culture and ways that people per-
formed their jobs. By digitizing all documents at their origins, the bank shifted a good por-
tion of document delivery from the traditional hard-copy print methodology to electronic
delivery at the desktop, which created a need to fully understand the cost of delivering docu-
ments to the desktop.
</p>
<p>While contrasting the cost of these channels, it became apparent that there was a gap in un-
derstanding the desktop delivery environment. Although the bank had a tight control on the
cost of faxing and the cost of impressions on multifunctional devices, it discovered two ele-
ments of concern. Bank of America owned one of the largest fleets of multifunctional copiers
of any organization in the world (more than 5,000 units). A multifunctional copier is one capa-
ble of copying, faxing, printing, and scanning documents.
</p>
<p>Several major problems emerged in the discovery process initiated by the sourcing team.
First, it was noted that only 5% of copiers were connected to computers or similar devices;
the remaining 95% were used solely for manual copying, which failed to fully exploit their in-
herent multifunctional capabilities. Second, because there was no active management of the
desktop printer environment, the bank was actually pushing print from a traditional method
to an even more expensive channel, the unregulated desktop printer. Finally, there were no me-
trics in place to understand the total cost of ownership at the desktop level. The total
amount spent on copying and printers was unknown but was estimated in the $90 million
range.

</p>
<p>658 Part 5 Critical Supply Chain Elements</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>To make matters worse, there was no single group responsible for managing desktop prin-
ters, no demand management, and no understanding of the total cost of ownership. As such,
the bank had no idea how many desktop printers were currently in use. All of these factors
made the task of managing the desktop environment, or even understanding the cost of that
environment, virtually impossible.
</p>
<p>THE SOLUTION: PRINTSMART
Faced with this situation, Document Management developed a program known as PrintSmart
that was aimed at controlling the desktop environment. The team began by centralizing all re-
sponsibility for the desktop environment under a single group. This organization created a de-
mand management function designed to drive impressions to the lowest-cost option
appropriate for workflow needs, with a target of concentrating impressions on connected multi-
functional devices. Desktop printers were now required to be networked where feasible, and
contracts were converted to cost-per-impression, using a total cost of ownership arrange-
ment. A three-year technology upgrade cycle was also built in.
</p>
<p>The Document Management team recognized that the best way to control document cost
would be to create a digital library of literally every document created. Once a document was
stored in the digital library, only then could supply management control how each piece was
printed. This approached was extended further. A senior vice president noted, &ldquo;If it was prin-
ted or in use, we wanted it in the library!&rdquo; This included everything from checks, deposit tick-
ets, magnetic integrated character recognition documents, and marketing pieces, to every
other type of bank document imaginable. The library had to capture, image, and upload data
on the use of every document, including usage patterns that included the volume data but
also indicated geographies, cost centers, lines of business, and so on. This required the crea-
tion of a very large relational database.
</p>
<p>The senior vice president also noted, &ldquo;Once the digital library was established, a number of
things started to happen. The team began to (1) consolidate suppliers and leverage pricing;
(2) move a considerable amount of inventory to print-on-demand; and (3) standardize docu-
ments and consolidate documents. The bank went from 45,000 forms to 6,000 through this
process. The print library has effectively reduced print cost by over 20% year over year. This
did not include the added advantages of reduced obsolescence and reduced time to market.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>RESULTS
To control the cost of document handling and printing, the Document Management team initi-
ated the PrintSmart strategy, with excellent results. This was accomplished through two ap-
proaches: demand management and facility re-engineering. Demand management, in the
context of document management, involves having supply management redirect all requisi-
tions originally targeted for desktop printers to multifunctional devices or shared networked
printers in its building. In only very rare circumstances, such as when someone works from
home or is traveling, Document Management will approve the purchase of a black-and-white,
standalone printer. These are purchased from an preapproved printer manufacturer with
whom a negotiated contract exists. This supplier provides a total cost of ownership lease on
printers, which is about a quarter of standard print costs, allowing Document Management
to more effectively monitor the network and track the volume of hard copies made.
</p>
<p>The second approach was to re-engineer every Bank of America facility across the country.
Early pilot program results were promising: The program reduced print cost by an additional
15 to 20%. The bank has now rolled facility re-engineering out to two cities, or 11 buildings.
To date, Document Management has increased connectivity for multifunctional devices from S

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5% to over 35%. About 7% of cost is still driven by people printing from old desktop prin-
ters, now about 55% of total print volume.
</p>
<p>The senior vice president notes, &ldquo;Previously, we had two to three associates per print device
&mdash;and in a PrintSmart-ed environment, we moved to one machine serving an average of
seven employees. All of the multifunctional copier/printers were leased, and we paid only for
the number of impressions. We are exploring an application that will allow us to track who is
making the impressions and how many per floor, allowing us to replenish paper and toner
based on consumption of equipment. We could then begin to track impressions per floor ver-
sus cut sheet volumes purchased&mdash;which allows us to do three things: (1) reduce the invest-
ment of paper held on-site; (2) improve predictive maintenance schedules; and (3) track
missing paper inventory.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>PrintSmart is a process that must interface with all other desktop groups within the bank, in-
cluding the help desk, which is outsourced to Compaq. The PrintSmart solution also had to
consider the impact of pushing increased digital traffic through the bank&rsquo;s networks and the
effects on bandwidth limitations that might exist across the bank&rsquo;s multiple locations. This
limitation required that Document Management work closely with the desktop group located
in the technology and operations organization group at the bank. Prior to implementing PrintS-
mart, the team ensured that the desktop technology team was 100% on board. The initiative
required that the senior vice president meet frequently with the corporate real estate team,
the networking team, and other key facilities and technology groups that would be affected
by the re-engineering of facilities to accommodate PrintSmart technology.
</p>
<p>Several problems soon became apparent. A typical issue was that there might be an inade-
quate number of print servers in a given city. The team also discovered that it was simpler
to centralize printer types on individual servers to enhance diagnostic capabilities. The team
also set up a device labeling methodology that mirrored the mail code system. Associates
can log on to the LAN in a re-engineered building, search devices by mail code, and discover
the networked devices that they can access locally.
</p>
<p>PrintSmart is a major initiative that will take several years to implement&mdash;and will clearly en-
tail a major culture change. The biggest change is for administrative staff, who now complain
about having to walk 20-plus feet to the printer (&ldquo;It ruins my workflow.&rdquo;). The groundswell level
of discontent cannot be underestimated. The senior vice president noted, &ldquo;At one point we were
worried if, politically, PrintSmart could survive this onslaught of protest. A program that re-
quires behavioral changes from almost every associate requires an unusual level of support
from the higher echelons. But at Bank of America, the executive sponsors have supported the pro-
gram 1000%.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The Document Management team also made a point of implementing PrintSmart at the
bank&rsquo;s corporate offices in Charlotte, North Carolina first after the five pilot buildings were
re-engineered. Why? &ldquo;We felt that if we were going to drive change into the company, we
would begin by changing Rome first,&rdquo; the senior vice president says. &ldquo;That way, people
couldn&rsquo;t point to us and complain that corporate wasn&rsquo;t taking its own medicine!&rdquo;

<p>CONCLUSION
In studying the best practices used in the procurement of transportation and logis-
</p>
<p>tics services, indirect spending, and other professional services, several common
themes pervade the discussion. These include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Link transportation, logistics, and other service activities directly to corpo-
rate strategy.
</p>
<p>&bull; Organize transportation, logistics, and indirect spending activities under a
single executive-level position if possible, utilizing a hybrid procurement
structure if the indirect spend is spread across several diverse business units.
</p>
<p>&bull; Expand and use the power of information and information-processing tech-
nology to capture spending behaviors, costs associated with procuring trans-
portation and services, and maverick spending.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish buy-in from senior executive management to the strategy, particu-
larly from the chief financial officer, who is key in overseeing compliance
with the strategy.
</p>
<p>&bull; Tie cost savings directly to actual spending in business units and be sure to
capture the savings either through a zero-based budget or through other ap-
propriate means.
</p>
<p>&bull; Form partnerships or alliances with a fewer number of service, transporta-
tion, and logistics providers to improve collaboration and cost-savings oppor-
tunities, while leveraging the indirect spend volume of the organization.
</p>
<p>&bull; Measure transportation, logistics, and service provider performance to drive
and sustain superior performance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish benchmarks against which suppliers and providers are expected to
perform and regularly review supplier performance against predetermined
goals.
</p>
<p>&bull; Establish project scope up front, and follow up routinely to ensure that it is
met in a reasonable and cost-effective manner.
</p>
<p>&bull; Review and re-evaluate indirect procurement strategies periodically to ensure
that user requirements and expectations are being met, along with cost targets.
</p>
<p>Supply management&rsquo;s involvement in transportation and services, although fairly
recent, is expected to continue to grow. Excellent opportunities exist for the supply
management professional to make major contributions in this important, but often
overlooked, area. Supply management professionals tasked with sourcing indirect ma-
terials and services must strive to become experts in these categories in order to man-
age and control them effectively. In addition, it is imperative for supply management
professionals to take into account user needs and tailor the sourcing process to ade-
quately accommodate them. A recent joint research paper by CAPS Research and
A. T. Kearney, Inc., sums up the importance of procuring services best: &ldquo;As compa-
nies seek to outsource additional non-strategic, non-core activities, outsourcers will
have to learn how to serve and add value in addition to landing initial contracts.&rdquo;24

<p>DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1. Discuss the business and legislative changes that resulted in an increased aware-
ness of the sourcing of transportation and logistics activities.
</p>
<p>2. What are the benefits associated with maintaining control and visibility of trans-
portation shipments?
</p>
<p>3. What are some of the key items you should plan on reviewing with a transporta-
tion or logistics service provider during a negotiation?
</p>
<p>4. Give a definition of a third-party logistics provider. What function does it serve?
</p>
<p>5. Discuss the conditions under which a buyer might prefer that a third-party logis-
tics provider arrange and control the transportation and storage of purchased
items.
</p>
<p>6. Compare and contrast the relative costs and service advantages and disadvantages
of air, motor, water, pipeline, and rail carriers.
</p>
<p>7. What are the major differences between a common and a contract carrier? Can a
buyer negotiate with a common carrier? Why or why not?
</p>
<p>8. How can an indirect buyer effectively use performance-based logistics or service-
level agreements to control the costs of procuring services?
</p>
<p>9. What are the different types of performance metrics used to measure transporta-
tion providers? Could this same list be used for a third-party logistics provider?
Why or why not?
</p>
<p>10. One of the benefits often cited by third-party logistics providers is their ability to
provide access to critical performance and operating data. Explain what is meant
by this statement.
</p>
<p>11. Provide some examples of spending that would fall under the category of services
versus indirect spending. What is the different between the two?
</p>
<p>12. One of the biggest problems cited by supply management executives in managing
their indirect spend is identifying where and how the spending is taking place.

this data?
</p>
<p>13. Why is it so important to have senior executive support when implementing an in-
direct spend procurement strategy?
</p>
<p>14. Discuss the importance of defining expectations and using standardized contracts
when sourcing professional services. Why is this different from sourcing direct ma-
terials and components?
</p>
<p>15. Can you provide some examples of power spenders of indirect spending and ser-
vices? How can training help to deploy an indirect spending strategy?

<p>Rolls-Royce Managing Critical Material Inputs
</p>
<p>When we think about Rolls-Royce, we most likely envision a wealthy person driving up
to a castle. Certainly the Rolls-Royce name is associated with luxury cars. Lesser known are
its high-quality jet engines. The company recently developed a new line of jet engines that
have superior fuel efficiency. These engines are based on advances in materials, manufactur-
ing technologies, and design.
</p>
<p>Delivering the finished product is dependent on suppliers and their ability to secure critical
raw materials such as titanium and nickel alloys. This problem is complicated by the fact
that titanium and nickel alloys are in short supply. Further, some of the critical suppliers are
smaller specialty parts suppliers that don&rsquo;t have volume to develop any priority with alloy pro-
viders. If the suppliers can&rsquo;t secure the raw materials, then Roll-Royce customers such as
Boeing and Airbus don&rsquo;t receive engines when needed.
</p>
<p>In 2003 Rolls-Royce, with the assistance of Newview Technologies, began building the criti-
cal raw material supply chain planning capabilities to meet the demands of aerospace manu-
facturers. The e-sourcing tool, called Material Specification Management, was rolled out in
2006 and enables aerospace manufacturers to manage the risk of acquiring critical raw
materials.
</p>
<p>Benefits include the ability to understand the total value chain&rsquo;s material needs, the capabili-
ties to publish coordinating schedules for sub-tier suppliers, the ability to help control mate-
rial and part source decisions, and the management of cost exposure to material price
volatility. Below is a discussion of the various modules embedded in the software and their
benefits to Rolls-Royce.
</p>
<p>The forecasting module allows Rolls-Royce to estimate the amount of material required to pro-
duce every part for every engine on the production plan. In cases where data does not exist,
inputs are derived on the basis of benchmarks for similar parts. Historically, Rolls-Royce
only had a rough idea of how much material its suppliers needed to meet part demand.
</p>
<p>By managing the critical supply chain node, demand plans can be developed that permit visi-
bility of part origination and location in the supply chain. Highly engineered parts such as
shafts, rings, disks, and rotative parts and blades often go through multiple-step processes,
and activities occur at different suppliers.
</p>
<p>Managing price volatility provides the ability to forecast the impact of material price changes
across the organization for individual engine models at any part level or part category level.
Historically, Rolls-Royce did not have a firm understanding of the total supply chain material
spend and therefore had a difficult time managing price volatility with hedging tools. Improve-
ments made through cost reductions on parts were offset by material price increases. For exam-
ple, if a buying team was able to reduce the part cost because of increased volume, leverage,
or process improvements, it was often offset by key material price increases.
</p>
<p>Controlling material and sourcing decisions in the supply chain permits Rolls-Royce to pro-
vide its suppliers with electronic part and material catalogs. Rolls-Royce then specifies
which products are preferred for suppliers to purchase. Rolls-Royce can also capture the sup-
plier&rsquo;s purchasing history and track the degree to which the supplier adhered to its rec-
ommendations. This allows Rolls-Royce to control the design-related material decisions at its
suppliers, ensuring that its critical quality requirements will be met.
</p>
<p>Managing bills of resources allows Rolls-Royce to initiate and manage information requests
to suppliers. Now the company can understand what material and supplier dependencies it
has, and where the critical bottlenecks reside within the extended supply chain, and it has

<p>The electronic revolution continues to affect the supply chain. As can be seen from
the chapter opening vignette and throughout this chapter, there are several exciting
new software tools emerging that will help supply managers in the future. This con-
trasts sharply with a few years ago when many organizations became pessimistic
about the opportunities to utilize web-based supply chain (e-SCM) solutions after the
dot bust era of 2001&ndash;2003. What actually happened was a change in market empha-
sis and focus. Weaker firms touting business models that did not provide value in
the supply chain were washed out of the market and became roadkill for the stron-
ger, market-focused firms. Mergers and consolidations reduced the number of value
players even further.
</p>
<p>Thus, by early 2004 the market carnages had eliminated the market excesses, built
during the dot boom era, and left the remaining market players in a better position
to offer value in SCM solutions. Meanwhile, on the buying side, organizations were be-
coming much more focused and sophisticated in making decisions involving invest-
ments in e-SCM systems. Business cases had to provide solid justifications that
supported a need for these systems. Given that there were fewer software providers,
possessing increased capabilities, the cycle times from system design to implementa-
tion were shortened. Finally, in this market providers were giving their customers bet-
ter pricing and terms, making justification of e-SCM systems even more likely.
Contrary to doom-and-gloom experts, e-SCM software uses are growing in applica-
tion and sophistication.
</p>
<p>This chapter is not a technical presentation of computerized information systems.
Instead, it focuses on a host of issues that managers in the supply chain must be
aware of to appreciate the role of information systems (IS) within purchasing. Many
purchasers will at some point become involved in the development of different types
of purchasing information systems, and knowledge of information systems applica-
tions is necessary in order for future managers to realize purchasing performance
objectives.
</p>
<p>We will begin the chapter with a discussion of the evolution of e-SCM systems, pro-
vide an overview of supply chain information systems, and then discuss the business
drivers for implementing these systems and applications. We will then describe enter-
prise systems in more detail, followed by the fundamental elements of purchasing
databases and data warehouses. Next we will discuss the elements of electronic data
interchange (EDI) as a precursor to the new era of e-sourcing and supply tools,
</p>
<p>the ability to manage around these constraints. This capability gives Rolls-Royce new visibil-
ity into its suppliers, the materials they use, and the process steps performed in the ex-
tended supply chain.
</p>
<p>Demand aggregation and managing sourcing decisions allow Rolls-Royce to publish the mate-
rial characteristics and specifications for all materials to sub-tier suppliers. It can also com-
municate the material specifications and suppliers that it prefers its parts suppliers to
utilize. This allows Rolls-Royce to further leverage its purchases of critical materials and pro-
vide important input into contract negotiations. It can also help identify potential supply bot-
tlenecks in the supply chain.

There are also discussions on ERP supplier relationship management and integrating
ERP systems into e-sourcing.
</p>
<p>Evolution of E-SCM Systems
Today supply managers expect powerful solutions to their business problems. How-
</p>
<p>ever, organizations did not always have sophisticated systems at their disposal. Ex-
hibit 18.1 traces the evolution of e-SCM systems. Early uses of information systems
were in the accounting and financial areas. However, beginning in the 1970s more IT
resources and software solutions were allocated to purchasing, operations, and distri-
bution. Organizations installed systems such as material requirements planning
(MRP) and distribution requirements planning (DRP). These systems were used to
improve the planning and control of inventory in manufacturing (MRP) and distribu-
tion (DRP).
</p>
<p>Because MRP and DRP systems were primarily internal, an electronic linkage to
suppliers and customers was needed. Led by efforts of the railroad and retail sectors,
electronic data interchange was developed as a solution to transfer customer and sup-
plier information in the 1980s.
</p>
<p>Although these early efforts provided efficiencies in the supply chain, intense com-
petition in the final two decades of the 20th century forced firms to re-engineer their
business processes to become even leaner. During this period, almost every major For-
tune 500 company went through some form of restructuring, as thousands of work-
ers and managers were shed in an effort to increase productivity and reduce costs. In
conjunction with this change, organizations further increased their information sys-
tems to perform tasks previously done by these workers. Thus enterprise resource
planning (ERP) systems became the rage of the 1990s and they continue today. The
goal of ERP systems is to integrate all business function planning and processing,
and to avoid data interruption in order to make better business decisions and run
the business more effectively and efficiently. Ideally, all the different functions in the
organization have access to and are working with the same data. Supply managers
were at the center of this trend and were challenged to develop accurate databases to
improve their decision making.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The next era in electronic commerce broadcast different applications on the
World Wide Web. Similar to the events that occurred 20 years earlier, ERP systems
were primarily internal and lacked the linkage to suppliers and customers. The Inter-
net provided the bridge; because of its low cost, lead software providers developed sys-
tems that could link customers and suppliers into the ERP system. These systems are
popularly termed &ldquo;supplier relationship management (SRM)&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer relation-
ship management (CRM)&rdquo; systems.
</p>
<p>As we move further into the 21st century, software solutions are aimed at collab-
oration among supply chain partners through point of sale systems, RFID, and other
information-sharing systems. Lastly, there are newer applications such as product life
cycle software, bid optimization, and computerized negotiation models that will be avail-
able to the purchasers of the future. These increasingly powerful tools will be linked to
an e-mobile environment with smaller laptop computers, personal digital assistants
(e.g., Blackberry), and increasingly powerful cell phones (e.g., Apple&rsquo;s I-phone), allow-
ing supply managers to have data access on a 24/7 basis irrespective of geographic
location.
</p>
<p>An Overview of the E-Supply Chain1
In this section we present an overview of the e-supply chain and describe some of
</p>
<p>the leading software providers in this fast-changing marketplace. Although the play-
ers in this industry have changed and will continue to change over time, the areas of
functionality and linkages will not.
</p>
<p>Supply Chain Information Flows
Supply chain information flows (and the information systems that embody them)
</p>
<p>serve six major functions:
</p>
<p>&bull; Record and retrieve critical data
</p>
<p>&bull; Execute and control physical and monetary flows
</p>
<p>&bull; Automate routine decisions
</p>
<p>&bull; Support planning activities
</p>
<p>&bull; Support higher-level tactical and strategic decision making
</p>
<p>&bull; Move and share information across firms and between users
</p>
<p>Levels of Functionality
Note from the list above how information flows cover everything from relatively
</p>
<p>low-level functionality (record and retrieve data) to sophisticated analytical support
tools. In addition, some of these information flows take place with little or no human
intervention, whereas others provide more of a support role to higher-level planning
and decision making.
</p>
<p>At the most basic level, information flows record and retrieve critical data, and
execute and control physical and monetary flows. This is sometimes referred to as
transaction processing. For example, your credit card company has a record including
your address, credit limit, payment history, and most recent balance. As time goes on
and you pay (or don&rsquo;t pay!) your monthly bills, these records are updated automati-
cally. Another example of transaction processing would be a bar code system to track
the actual location of a package in the distribution network.

</p>
<p>Chapter 18 Supply Chain Information Systems and Electronic Sourcing 669</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>At a somewhat higher level of functionality, information systems are often used to
support routine decision making. In many cases, these decisions are automated, with ex-
ceptions dealt with manually. Suppose, for example, you are a retailer with 60,000
items to manage. Do you want to manually forecast, calculate the correct order quanti-
ties, establish reorder points for all these items, and kick off an order when needed?
Of course not. In cases like this, companies often depend on automated inventory
management systems to make the decisions for them. Of course, companies can al-
ways override the information system&rsquo;s decisions when the situation warrants.
</p>
<p>Beyond these transactions and routine decisions, information systems also play a
critical role in supply chain planning and strategic decision making in sourcing and
supply. As an example of the former, a company will decide on the technologies that
may be required for the next generation of products or services, and identify the re-
quirements in terms of the supply base, forecasted demand, production decisions,
and projected cash flows. The strategic planning systems can provide critical informa-
tion and provide it in a way that is meaningful to marketing, operations, purchasing,
and finance personnel.
</p>
<p>In such cases, information systems can support strategic decision making. Here, so-
phisticated analytical tools are often used to search for patterns or relationships in
the data. Examples include customer segment analysis, product life cycle forecasting,
and what-if analyses regarding long-term product or capacity decisions. These infor-
mation systems have to be highly flexible in how they manipulate and present the
data because the strategic question of interest may change from one situation to the
next. Such information systems are generally referred to as decision support systems
(DSSs). The name emphasizes the fact that these systems support, but do not make,
the decision.
</p>
<p>Directions of Linkage
To fully understand the role of information flows in a supply chain, we have to
</p>
<p>consider not only the level of functionality, but also the direction of the linkages. For
example, there are information flows that link a firm with its customers, broadly re-
ferred to as customer relationship management flows, and those that link a firm with
its suppliers, known as supplier relationship management flows (Exhibit 18.2). There
are also flows that link higher-level planning and decision making with lower-level ac-
tivities within the firm (dubbed internal supply chain management by Chopra and
Meindl2). Later we will describe some of the specific IS applications found in the
CRM and SRM areas.
</p>
<p>A Map of SCM Systems
The map of SCM systems was first laid out in 1999 by Steven Kahl,3 then a software
</p>
<p>industry analyst at Piper Jaffray. Kahl&rsquo;s map was later refined by Chopra and Meindl,4
</p>
<p>who applied the labels &ldquo;customer relationship management,&rdquo; &ldquo;supplier relationship
management,&rdquo; and &ldquo;internal supply chain management&rdquo; to various areas of the map.
</p>
<p>Our map (Exhibit 18.3) distinguishes the various applications by the level of func-
tionality (strategic, planning/tactical, and execution) and the direction of linkages (sup-
pliers, internal supply chain, and customers). Here we add an additional column
labeled &ldquo;Logistics.&rdquo; Logistics applications deal with warehousing and transportation is-
sues, such as determining warehouse locations, optimizing transportation systems, and
controlling the movement of materials between supply chain partners. Most businesses

<p>do not do a good job of integrating these applications with the other applications. We
will return to this point later in the chapter.
</p>
<p>Enterprise resource planning systems are large, integrated business transaction pro-
cessing and reporting systems. The primary advantage of ERP systems is that they
pull together all of the classic business functions such as accounting, finance, sales,
and operations, to name a few, into a single, tightly integrated package that uses a
common database (Exhibit 18.4 on p. 673).

<p>To understand why this is such a big deal, we have to consider what things
looked like in the old days. First, every functional area had its own set of software ap-
plications, often running on completely different systems. Sharing information (such
as forecasts or customer information) between systems was a nightmare. To make
matters worse, the same information often was entered multiple times in different
ways. ERP pulled all of these disparate systems into one place.

<p>Invisible Supplier Has
Penney&rsquo;s Shirts All
Buttoned Up
</p>
<p>On a Saturday afternoon in August 2003, Carolyn Thurmond walked into a JC Penney
store in Atlanta and bought a white Stafford wrinkle-free dress shirt for her husband, size
17 neck, 34/35 sleeve. On Monday morning a computer technician in Hong Kong downloaded
a record of the sale. By Wednesday afternoon, a factory worker in Taiwan had packed an iden-
tical replacement shirt into a bundle to be shipped back to the Atlanta store. The speedy pro-
cess, part of a streamlined supply chain and production system for dress shirts that was
years in the making, has put Penney at the forefront of the continuing revolution in U.S. retail-
ing. In an industry where the goal is speedy turnaround of merchandise, Penney stores now
hold almost no extra inventory of house-brand dress shirts. Less than a decade ago, Penney
would have had thousands of them warehoused across the United States, tying up capital
and slowly going out of style. The entire program is designed and operated by TAL Apparel
Ltd., a closely held Hong Kong shirtmaker. TAL collects point-of-sale data for Penney&rsquo;s shirts
directly from its stores in North America, then runs the numbers through a computer model
it designed. The Hong Kong company then decides how many shirts to make, and in what
styles, colors, and sizes. The manufacturer sends the shirts directly to each Penney store, by-
passing the retailer&rsquo;s warehouses&mdash;and no corporate decision makers. Penney and other re-
tailers such as Brooks Brothers and Lands&rsquo; End have been willing to turn over these
decisions because TAL can do them better and more cheaply. With decisions made at the fac-
tory, TAL can respond instantly to changes in consumer demand, stepping up production if
there is a spike in sales or dialing it down if there&rsquo;s a slump. The system &ldquo;directly links the
manufacturer to the customer,&rdquo; says Rod Birkins, vice president for sourcing of JC Penney Pri-
vate Brands Inc. To develop this system, TAL designed a computer model to estimate an
ideal inventory of house-brand shirts for each of Penney&rsquo;s 1,040 North American stores, by
style, color, and size. Penney provided TAL with goals for how often a store&rsquo;s inventory
should be replenished, then stepped back and let it do the rest. TAL&rsquo;s computer model be-
gan to outpace the Penney system still used for the retailer&rsquo;s other merchandise. For some
shirt models, stores could not keep half as much in stock as they had previously. The sys-
tem hasn&rsquo;t been flawless, though. On a few occasions, TAL underestimated Penney&rsquo;s needs
significantly, and the factory had to sacrifice other customers to rush out Penney&rsquo;s order
first, sending some shirts by air freight to be sure they arrived on time. Costing 10 times as
much as ocean shipping, sending shirts by air was &ldquo;a painful decision,&rdquo; admits Ming Chen,
a manager at TAL&rsquo;s factory. &ldquo;But sometimes you have to decide which customers you&rsquo;re go-
ing to take care of.&rdquo;

<p>As Exhibit 18.4 suggests, ERP&rsquo;s traditional strengths lie in routine decision making
and transaction processing. To the extent that ERP systems support higher-level plan-
ning and decision making, these systems tend to focus primarily on internal opera-
tions. ERP systems also capture much of the raw data needed to support higher-level
decision support systems aimed at strategic decision making.
</p>
<p>SRM and CRM applications, in contrast, are directly focused on planning and man-
aging the firm&rsquo;s external linkages. Exhibit 18.5 shows how Chopra and Meindl give ex-
amples of the types of functionality provided by these applications.
</p>
<p>Currently, vendors specializing in CRM and SRM tend to provide higher levels of
functionality in their chosen areas than do the ERP vendors. As a result, many firms
choose a standard ERP package for routine decision making and transaction process-
ing, and use bolt-on CRM and SRM applications to manage external relationships.
</p>
<p>However, this situation is changing as the major ERP vendors, such as SAP and Or-
acle, look for ways to increase the CRM and SRM functionality of their own systems.
Whether the specialized CRM and SRM vendors can maintain enough of a functional-
ity lead to justify a separate system remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>The last set of supply chain IS applications we will discuss are those dealing di-
rectly with logistics decisions. These applications can be divided into three main cate-

<p>gories: network design applications, transportation and warehouse planning systems,
and execution systems.
</p>
<p>Network design applications address such long-term, strategic questions as where
should we locate warehouses, and how large should our transportation fleet be?
These applications often make use of simulation and optimization modeling.
</p>
<p>Transportation and warehouse planning systems attempt to allocate fixed logistics
capacity in the best possible way, given business requirements. For example, such a
system could help you decide how many units to ship from each warehouse to each
demand point. To find the optimal answer, the system would allow you to build an
optimization model that used data on warehouse capacities, demand levels, and ship-
ping costs to generate the lowest-cost solution.
</p>
<p>Execution systems kick off and control the movement of materials between supply
chain partners. Within a warehouse, for example, sophisticated execution systems tell
workers where to store items, where to go to pick them up, and how many to pick.
Similarly, bar code systems and global positioning systems have dramatically changed
the ability of businesses to manage actual movements in the distribution system. Fif-
teen years ago, the only thing a trucking firm could tell you was that your shipment
was &ldquo;on the way&rdquo; and &ldquo;should be there in a day or two.&rdquo; Now, trucking firms can tell
their customers the exact location of a shipment and the arrival time within hours, if
not minutes.
</p>
<p>As important as these logistics applications are, the level of integration between
these applications and those in the other areas of the map is astonishingly weak at
present. But what does this mean? For one thing, it means that many supply chain de-
cisions, such as when to order materials and when to ship customer orders, are often
made without considering the impact on logistics. Let&rsquo;s look at the experience of an
actual firm.
</p>
<p>Buyers were ordering materials from suppliers whenever they needed them, with-
out regard to the shipping costs. The result was many small, expensive shipments. Al-
though inventory costs were low, transportation costs were going through the roof.
The company determined that by batching up orders over several days, they could
place bigger orders with the suppliers. The suppliers, in turn, could make larger,
cheaper shipments, and shipping costs were cut by nearly 70%. An unexpected bene-
fit was that the firm also had fewer invoices to deal with, because the supplier would
send one invoice with each shipment, whether there were 10 items or 100 items
listed.
</p>
<p>Increasing the level of integration between logistics and other SCM applications
presents firms with both technical and organizational hurdles. On the technical side,
efforts to integrate decisions across sales, operations, and distribution increase the
complexity of the optimization and simulation models currently used by logistics
managers. On the organizational side, firms have to get used to involving logistics per-
sonnel earlier in the decision-making process, rather than just calling on them when
it is time to make a shipment.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Drivers of New Supply Chain Systems
and Applications
</p>
<p>As organizations continue to face increasing cost pressure, they are relying more
on systems to do the work of people, which in turn increases the productivity of
these workers. Productivity is a critical metric of performance that is driving compa-
nies to integrate new information systems. As mentioned previously, unlike with the
previous generation of dot-com companies, executives are now very careful to de-
velop a solid business case and justify the benefits and payback of investments in
new supply chain systems. The primary drivers of these new e-SCM systems include
(1) internal and external integration, (2) globalization and communications, (3) data
information management, (4) new business processes, (5) replacement of legacy or ob-
solete systems, and (6) strategic cost management.
</p>
<p>Internal and External Strategic Integration
As supply chain members increasingly work together, integration must occur be-
</p>
<p>tween different functions that are internal to the organization (purchasing, engineer-
ing, manufacturing, marketing, logistics, accounting, and so on), as well as between
parties that are external to the organization (end customers, third-party logistics
firms, retailers, distributors, warehouses, transportation providers, suppliers, agents, fi-
nancial institutions, and so on). Both types of integration present their own set of
challenges. Internal strategic integration requires that all members within a company
use the same information system that spans across business sites and functions. This
is most often accomplished through a companywide enterprise resource planning sys-
tem that links these internal groups together via a single integrated set of master rec-
ords. We will discuss the challenges of ERP later in the chapter. External integration
refers to the systems that link external suppliers, distributors, and final customers to
the focal company. This integration is needed to forecast demand and balance the lev-
els of supply and demand at different points in the supply chain. Systems used to inte-
grate supply chain members include Internet linkages, network communications, and
e-sourcing applications.
</p>
<p>Globalization and Communication
Although the notion of a global market is easy to envision, carrying out business
</p>
<p>in different cultures and geographies is an extremely challenging proposition. Compa-
nies require systems that enable them to manage suppliers and customers in all cor-
ners of the world, calculate total global logistics costs, increase leverage and
component standardization worldwide, and improve communication of strategies
across global business units and supply chain partners.
</p>
<p>Data Information Management
New forms of servers, telecommunication and wireless applications, and software
</p>
<p>are enabling companies to do things that were once thought impossible. These sys-
tems raise the accuracy, frequency, and speed of communication between suppliers
and customers, as well as for internal users. Information systems must be able to ef-
fectively filter, analyze, and mine an abundance of data to enable effective decision
making. Users must be able to extract from databases the information they need to S

<p>make better supply chain decisions. This is often achieved through data warehouse
systems (described later in the chapter) and associated decision support systems.
</p>
<p>New Business Processes
Business processes are constantly being changed in response to a rapidly shifting ex-
</p>
<p>ternal environment. Such processes&mdash;which include supplier evaluation and selection,
negotiation, contracting, co-design efforts, and inventory management&mdash;are being
mapped, studied, and changed in order to reduce redundancies, delays, and waste. In
so doing, organizations can create a rapid response capability that allows them to
quickly adapt to their customers&rsquo; changing needs and control costs whenever possible.
</p>
<p>Information systems such as computer networks and ERP are enabling companies
to link these processes in a more effective manner.
</p>
<p>Replacement of Legacy Systems
As companies adopted systems over time, people became familiar with the new
</p>
<p>procedures. In so doing, however, companies often adopted a piecemeal approach to
system usage, such that each function (accounting, purchasing, engineering) used its
own system, which was not linked to other functional systems. These obsolete sys-
tems (often called legacy systems) have now been integrated into a single enterprise-
wide system used by everyone in the supply chain. Promising to solve hardware
incompatibilities that existed before and to reduce excessive maintenance and pro-
gramming costs, the systems are also being adopted to exploit the new hardware tech-
nologies emerging in the areas of computer networking, telecommunications, and
web-based applications.
</p>
<p>Strategic Cost Management
Throughout the complete supply chain cycle, from order fulfillment back to pur-
</p>
<p>chasing and order payment, millions of transactions take place between different par-
ties. In the past, these transactions were all done on paper. In order to determine
specific cost drivers behind different business processes, companies often estimated
costs based on outdated cost accounting systems. New systems promise to automate
data capture throughout supply chain systems, thereby automating the transactions
that occur in the traditional procurement cycle. Not only will this reduce the costs of
operating purchasing and logistics departments, but it will also enable the effective al-
location of resources and result in immense reductions in inventory held in ware-
houses and stockrooms throughout the entire supply chain.
</p>
<p>In the remainder of the chapter, we discuss the four primary types of information sys-
tems used in managing supply chains: (1) enterprise resource planning, (2) purchasing
databases and data warehouses, (3) electronic data interchange, and (4) e-sourcing appli-
cations. Although we cannot hope to do justice to the breadth of these topics in one
chapter, this is meant as an introduction to them, with the understanding that contin-
ual learning and evolution of user needs in these systems is required.
</p>
<p>Enterprise Resource Planning Systems
An enterprise resource planning system is an integrated transaction processing
</p>
<p>and reporting system. The different software applications and forms of ERP support

<p>provide the means for tracking organizational resources, including people, processes,
and technology. The system serves as the backbone to the organization in terms of
providing the information and support required for making decisions.
</p>
<p>ERP systems add a process logic to an organizational information system and cre-
ate a fundamental discipline in business processes. Whereas in the past managers
and staff were free to make decisions independent of other functional areas, ERP sys-
tems effectively force people to interact together in a single system, even if they
would prefer not to! As shown in Exhibit 18.6, ERP systems also create a process
logic between the closely related areas of customer order management, manufactur-
ing planning and execution, purchasing processes, and financial management and
accounting.
</p>
<p>In effect, ERP systems enable people in these very different parts of the business
to communicate with one another. In an ideal case of moving information across the
supply chain, sales representatives enter customer orders directly into a company&rsquo;s
ERP via a laptop and modem. The sales reps access the sales order planning and mas-
ter production schedule. Once the orders are input in the system, the sales reps can
provide an available-to-promise report and can inform customers when they can ex-
pect order delivery. The master production schedule drives the material requirements
system, which automatically generates purchase orders to ensure that suppliers de-
liver parts, components, and services in time to produce the customer&rsquo;s order.
</p>
<p>The material requirements planning module converts material requirements into
purchase requisitions that purchasing places with selected suppliers. When the sup-
plier delivers the components, this information is passed through to the scheduling
system, which ensures that the components are linked to the specific production
order on the shop floor. Once production begins, the salesperson in the field also

<p>knows that the order will soon be delivered to the customer. Once delivered, cus-
tomer billing and payment are also automatically generated by the ERP system.
</p>
<p>The idea of having a single information system that links sales, production, trans-
portation, warehousing, and purchasing appears to be an inherently obvious way to
manage these different business processes. Historically, individual systems were able
to fulfill the informational requirements of sales, purchasing, production, and so on,
but they were not linked to one another in any way. Most importantly, different leg-
acy systems did not communicate with accounting or financial reporting systems.
This made it difficult, if not impossible, to be able to extract cost data to allocate over-
head costs to different parts of the business.
</p>
<p>A typical ERP system is designed around four primary business processes (see Ex-
hibit 18.6):
</p>
<p>1. Selling a product or service. Customer order management process
</p>
<p>2. Making a product. Production planning and execution process
</p>
<p>3. Buying a product. Procurement process
</p>
<p>4. Costing, paying the bills, collecting. Financial/management accounting and re-
porting process (integrated across the prior three processes)
</p>
<p>ERP systems facilitate the integration of these processes by adopting a single cus-
tomer, product, and supplier database. One master record is used for the enterprise
with multiple views. All processes use a common database, and information is cap-
tured only once, essentially eliminating the possibility of inaccurate data entering the
database. Information is rolled down to the affected business process in real time,
eliminating delays of information sharing. Visibility of specific transactions taking
place in each business process is accessible to everyone in the organization; theoreti-
cally, anyone wanting to find out information, such as where an order is in the pro-
cess or whether a supplier has been paid, can obtain the latest updates by going
through the system (instead of making phone calls). In addition, all business pro-
cesses are linked with the work flow through the use of templates for entering infor-
mation about transactions at every step.
</p>
<p>The actual process of implementing a new ERP system in an environment where
people have grown accustomed to using their single, familiar legacy system has
proved to be a monumental task in many organizations. Many implementation ef-
forts have turned into multimillion-dollar projects involving consultants residing on-
site for months and even years. Why is the task of ERP implementation proving to
be so difficult and expensive?
</p>
<p>Implementing ERP Systems
When businesses implement an ERP system, they must by definition adhere to a
</p>
<p>more rigorous set of business processes. Chapter 12 discusses process mapping as a
tool to identify what exactly happens within any given business process. Before organi-
zations actually implement ERP, they must first create a process map for every pro-
cess shown in Exhibit 18.6. When companies actually map what they believe a
process looks like, they discover that the actual process is quite different from what
they thought it should look like. In some cases, no formal process exists, because ev-
eryone in the functional organization has done it his or her own unique way. When
it comes time to create an information system around business processes, many com-
panies discover that they must also re-engineer or change their business processes

<p>before they can build an information system around them. In some cases, changing
these business processes requires a major organizational and cultural shift. Although
ERP consultants can effectively create a system around a well-defined business pro-
cess, they cannot create a system around a business process that has not been well de-
fined or explained to them by employees.
</p>
<p>In order to effectively implement an ERP system, a company must go through
four steps to ensure that the business processes are effectively re-engineered and
improved:
</p>
<p>1. Define the current process as is. An ERP implementation team of subject-
matter experts document what the current process looks like.
</p>
<p>2. Define what the best-in-class business process should be. At this point, the
team must have a clear understanding of what the final objective of the pro-
cess is. Further, they must understand what the ERP system will replace and
how the benefits are likely to occur.
</p>
<p>3. Develop the system. This is an iterative process in which consultants work in
conjunction with those managers who are most familiar with the business pro-
cesses in question.
</p>
<p>4. Work through all final bugs and then flip the switch. A danger that often ex-
ists when flipping the switch&mdash;switching over from the old system to the new
system&mdash;is that the company may not be ready for the change, or the system
may not be completely configured to handle the specific activities that keep
the business running.

systems.

<p>A Consultant&rsquo;s Views
on Navigating ERP
Implementations
</p>
<p>Abide Consulting, a Florida-based consulting firm, has worked with several organiza-
tions to assist in the transition from disparate legacy-based systems to an integrated ERP
system. Currently, Premier International is working with a consumer products organization to
coordinate the worldwide implementation of an ERP system. What follows is a detailed look
at one strategy for ERP implementation.
</p>
<p>The typical life cycle of an ERP implementation utilizes a seven-stage process. The cycle involves
the following phases: (1) discovery; (2) design; (3) system build-out; (4) testing; (5) end user train-
ing; (6) cutover; and (7) post-cutover support. The stages are shown in Exhibit 18.7 on p. 680.
</p>
<p>In the discovery phase, a core team is assembled consisting of both internal and external sub-
ject-matter experts. Teams are typically grouped into work streams of the functional areas be-
ing implemented in the ERP system (e.g., operations, inventory management, finance,
sourcing). Training sessions bring the team up to speed on strategic objectives of the proj-
ect, time lines, project organization and process, new software functionality, and so on. The
team then begins a detailed analysis and review of the existing business processes.

</p>
<p>Chapter 18 Supply Chain Information Systems and Electronic Sourcing 679</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>On larger, more complex ERP implementations, it is also recommended that significant atten-
tion be focused on the data and data delivery processes. Data integrity (consistency of data
within or across systems) and data quality (accuracy and completeness of data) are critical
components of an ERP implementation and can often be overlooked. For example, at a previ-
ous client, it was discovered the first day live on the new ERP system that the finished prod-
uct weight data were inaccurate and in many cases missing altogether. Weights for shipping
manifests could not be calculated. The situation brought outbound shipping to a standstill.
Trucks and product sat idle in the shipping docks for days until the issue was resolved.
</p>
<p>Next, in the design phase, the new processes &ldquo;to be&rdquo; required to support the ERP system are
developed and process flow mappings are created. Any process requiring IT involvement is
documented in a functional specification. These include reports, integrations, conversions,
and enhancements (RICE elements). Next a fit/gap analysis is conducted, which involves find-
ing out the difference between the existing systems and the new ERP design. Finally, once
the core team has identified and resolved the fit/gaps, it is able to define and document the
detail scope of the ERP solution required for the business.
</p>
<p>The third step is the build phase. In this phase, the IT team begins to take a larger role in
the implementation. The ERP system is configured with functional parameters and custom-
ized business data (company branch plants, financial chart of accounts, and so on) The IT
team completes the initial development of the RICE elements that were defined in the design
phase.
</p>
<p>A typical testing phase will involve several iterations of testing business processes and RICE
elements associated with the new ERP system. Unit testing and conference room pilots
(CRPs) involve executing scripts isolated to a specific business process or RICE element. If
the tests are successful then an integrated conference room pilot (iCRP) is performed. The
iCRP involves executing end-to-end scripts across business processes and work streams
(e.g., plan to make, make to deliver). Finally, key users of the system are given access to
test their business process in the new system (referred to as user acceptance testing). Key
users involve many functional departments along the supply chain including sourcing, inven-
tory control, production planning, and customer service.
</p>
<p>End user training can be performed exclusively by outside consultants, a mix of external and
internal personnel, or strictly internally within the organization. The deciding factor as to the
method is the extent of ERP implementations at other business units and whether there are in-
ternal personnel willing to conduct the training. Oftentimes, to bridge this gap, consultants will
perform a train-the-trainers program to initialize the training and build a cadre of trainers
within the organization.
</p>
<p>During the cutover phase, the organization begins to take greater ownership of the ERP sys-
tem. Throughout the implementation, the organization must have internal champions, who

<p>Purchasing Databases and Data Warehouses
A prerequisite needed before introducing any type of ERP system that manip-
</p>
<p>ulates data is the development of a reliable database&mdash;an integrated collection of com-
puter files capable of storing operational data essential for managing a department.
</p>
<p>Databases are highly efficient in the storage and retrieval of data because there is
minimal overlapping of information between the files. Reduced redundancy of infor-
mation between files allows different systems to cross-reference and efficiently use
the data contained in all files.5 In the past, different user groups could share data
from the files as needed but gain access only to the data necessary to support their sys-
tem needs. The new forms of ERP systems are allowing more users from functional
groups other than purchasing to access these files.
</p>
<p>are experts that have the backing of top management to drive the implementation. As with
any other change initiative, ERP involves changing people&rsquo;s behavior, and this requires man-
agement support. In the cutover phase, both customers and suppliers are contacted to en-
sure that any and all outstanding issues have been addressed.
</p>
<p>All too often, unplanned issues surface internally or at the supplier and customer end immedi-
ately after the cutover. Precautionary steps can be taken well in advance of the actual cut-
over in order to limit risk to business processes. Suppliers, customers, and business partners
are notified of the activity to prepare them for any issues or changes. Safety stocks of compo-
nents and ingredients can be increased. Additionally, some organizations choose to execute a
prebuild of finished stock, where production is ramped up over normal demand.
</p>
<p>Data integrity issues also provide unplanned surprises.
</p>
<p>In the last phase (post-cutover support ), the core implementation team resolves post-
implementation problems and software failures, and conducts process upgrades. It is impor-
tant that the organization discuss the expected role of the consultants and the software pro-
vider in the post-cutover phase during contract negotiations.
</p>
<p>In summary, successful ERP implementation is a journey, not a destination. There are sev-
eral key issues that will enhance the experience of the journey and reduce both costs and
risks. These include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Develop a good understanding of the existing business process
&bull; Develop improved future business process designs
&bull; Identify inconsistencies and poor quality in existing data
&bull; Ensure that business processes conform to ERP system parameters
&bull; Insist that users replace redundant legacy systems
&bull; Stagger implementations of ERP systems across regions and business locations
&bull; Schedule cutover during off-peak seasons
&bull; Determine how much additional safety stock is necessary
&bull; Develop and train a core team of internal personnel as resources
&bull; Execute rigorous and structured testing cycles

<p>Although definitions vary, a data warehouse is generally thought of as a decision
support tool for collecting information from multiple sources and making that infor-
mation available to end users in a consolidated, consistent manner. Rather than try-
ing to develop one unified system or linking all systems in terms of processing, a
data warehouse provides the means to combine the data in one place and make it
available to all of the systems.
</p>
<p>In most cases, a data warehouse is a consolidated database maintained separately
from an organization&rsquo;s production system databases. Many organizations have multi-
ple databases, often containing duplicate data. A data warehouse, in theory, is orga-
nized around informational subjects rather than specific business processes. The data
warehouse stores, in a format that is readily accessible by end users, data fed to it
from multiple production databases. Data held in data warehouses are time-depen-
dent, historical data; they may also be aggregated. For example, separate production
systems may track sales and coupon mailings. Combining data from these different
systems may yield insights into the effectiveness of coupon sales promotions that
would not be immediately evident from the output data of either system alone. Inte-
grated within a data warehouse, however, such information could be easily extracted.
</p>
<p>Purchasing processes require a variety of information maintained on different data-
bases, which make data warehouses very useful. The purchasing system must be able to
pull data from and store data into the host data file. If a proposed purchasing system re-
quires nonexistent data, then a new database must collect and store the information.
</p>
<p>A basic purchasing system requires, at a minimum, access to a number of databases
or files. A file may be a collection of specific data, sorted in alphanumeric order or by cri-
teria chosen by the user. Examples of some of these files include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Part file. Records the part numbers or stockkeeping units (SKUs) that all
firms rely on to identify the thousands of unique purchased entities within a
system. The actual content of the part file is a function of a firm&rsquo;s specific in-
formational requirements. The time required to capture information on part
numbers and enter them into a database can be significant.
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier name and address file. Contains the names and addresses (including
e-mail addresses) of every supplier with which a firm does business.
</p>
<p>&bull; Historical usage file. Stores historical usage by part number and using loca-
tion. This information supports inventory analysis and updating of material
forecasts with actual historical data.
</p>
<p>&bull; Open-order and past-due file. Maintains the status of open material releases
and stores an order as pending until a firm physically receives the scheduled
release. Any orders not received by their due date become past due. This file
provides data that a buyer or material planner requires to maintain visibility
and control of the material pipeline.
</p>
<p>&bull; Bill of material file. Details the component requirements of a part number.
It is an integral part of the material requirements planning system. If the ma-
terial system generates a release for an end-item or subassembly part num-
ber, then the system must also generate releases for all components as well.
This file also provides visibility about sourcing requirements for new parts
with components.
</p>
<p>&bull; Engineering requirements file. Provides visibility to the specific engineering re-
quirements and specifications for a part number. May also include updates

</p>
<p>These databases support the development of both basic and sophisticated purchas-
ing and material information systems. Although purchasing is not responsible for di-
rectly maintaining all of the data on these files, it must have access to the data to
support its operating requirements.
</p>
<p>Technology for Electronic Communication
between Buyers and Sellers
</p>
<p>Up until now, we have discussed elements of purchasing information and data
flows that reside primarily within the enterprise. Clearly, however, purchasing must
communicate effectively with external suppliers to be able to share information, fore-
casts, and updates, and to make payments and so on. Traditional information flows
between buyers and suppliers often necessitate a lengthy sequential process com-
posed of multiple steps required to support the servicing as well as the fulfillment of
the order. Examples of these information flows include:
</p>
<p>&bull; Transmission of the product specifications from buyer to supplier
</p>
<p>&bull; Submission of a bid
</p>
<p>&bull; Acceptance of the contract
</p>
<p>&bull; Inspection and receipt of documents associated with the shipment
</p>
<p>&bull; Accounting audits
</p>
<p>&bull; Submission of payment
</p>
<p>Some of the problems that occur within these traditional information flows include in-
creased transaction time, low accuracy due to data-handling errors, high utilization
of staff time and resources, and increased uncertainty in the form of both mailing
and processing delays. Although many companies rely on e-mail as a tried-and-true
communication method, there are a number of other technologies that allow purchas-
ing to communicate effectively with external suppliers.
</p>
<p>Electronic Data Interchange
An early approach to facilitating transactions electronically was electronic data in-
</p>
<p>terchange&mdash;a communications standard that supports interorganizational electronic
exchange of common business documents and information. First implemented in the
1980s, EDI represented a cooperative effort between buyer and seller to become more
competitive by streamlining the communication process through eliminating many of
the steps involved in traditional information flows. The basic components of an EDI
system include the following:
</p>
<p>1. A standard form (EDI standards). Includes the basic rules of formatting and
syntax agreed upon by the users in the network. The American National

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Standards Institute ACS X12 series of EDI standards was one of the first
adopted by many companies.
</p>
<p>2. A translation capability (EDI software). Translates the company-specific data-
base information into EDI standard format for transmission.
</p>
<p>3. A mail service (EDI network). Responsible for the transmission of the docu-
ment, usually in the form of a direct network or through a third-party pro-
vider. Such a value-added network (VAN) serves as an intermediary post
office for the systems.
</p>
<p>The process that occurs when buyer and supplier go through an EDI transaction ide-
ally progresses in the following manner:
</p>
<p>1. The computer in the buying company monitors the real-time inventory status
of the item purchased using technologies such as bar code scanners.
</p>
<p>2. When it is determined, according to a predefined reorder criterion, that there
is a need to order more of the item, the application program notifies the trans-
lation software.
</p>
<p>3. An EDI purchase order is created and released against a prenegotiated blan-
ket amount, and the purchase order is sent to the supplier.
</p>
<p>4. The supplier&rsquo;s computer receives the order and the EDI software translates
the order into the supplier&rsquo;s format.
</p>
<p>5. A functional acknowledgment, which indicates receipt of the order, is automat-
ically generated and transmitted back to the buyer.
</p>
<p>6. When the original EDI purchase order is created, a number of additional elec-
tronic transactions may occur. Bridging software transmits the relevant data
to the buyer&rsquo;s accounts payable application, to the buyer&rsquo;s receiving file, to the
supplier&rsquo;s warehouse or factory file, and to the supplier&rsquo;s invoicing file.
</p>
<p>7. Once the order is filled from the supplier&rsquo;s warehouse or factory, a shipping
notice is created and transmitted to the buyer. This shipping notice may re-
quire some manual data entry by the shipper. However, this is the first time
that any manual keystrokes are required in the entire process.
</p>
<p>8. Upon receipt of the goods, a shipping notice is electronically entered into the
receiving file. Although additional keying may be required, technology often
eliminates this step as well.
</p>
<p>9. The receipt notice is transmitted through bridging software to the accounts
payable application and to the supplier&rsquo;s invoicing application, whereupon an
invoice is electronically generated and transmitted to the buyer.
</p>
<p>10. Once the invoice is received by the buyer&rsquo;s computer, it is translated into the
buyer&rsquo;s format and the invoice, receiving notice, and purchase order are elec-
tronically reconciled (eliminating the need for an accounting audit).
</p>
<p>11. A payment authorization is electronically created and transmitted to accounts
payable, the receivables application is updated to indicate an open receivable,
and payment is transmitted electronically from the buyer&rsquo;s bank to the suppli-
er&rsquo;s bank.
</p>
<p>12. An electronic remittance advice is transmitted to the supplier, and upon re-
ceipt, this information is translated into accounts receivable and the buyer is
given credit for payment.S

<p>Within this process, there are only three instances of manual data entry. In tradi-
tional information flows, each step would require that paperwork be completed and
filed by clerical staff. Thus EDI saves a great deal of time and paperwork&mdash;as well as
allowing fewer opportunities for errors, no mailing or physical transmission delays,
and lower clerical costs.
</p>
<p>EDI and the Internet
Despite the promise of greater diffusion of EDI via value-added networks, EDI re-
</p>
<p>mained a technology that required significant investment by companies to imple-
ment. EDI technology required investment in application-specific hardware that
could not be used for other purposes. Because there are service fees associated with
VANs, they may be more expensive to use than direct networks. Smaller suppliers in
particular found it difficult to justify the investment in EDI technology and struggled
with the demands placed on them from different companies to adopt differing EDI
systems. Finally, EDI was never considered an interactive mode of communication.
Each time a transmission was sent, it implied that a decision had been made: an or-
der for a fixed amount placed, a forecast of future demand fixed, a lead time for deliv-
ery specified. There was never any means for the buying and supplying parties to
actually interact, collaborate, and reach a decision through joint, bilateral communica-
tion. In the last five years, however, Internet technology emerged that has changed
business-to-business (B2B) information systems.
</p>
<p>As shown in Exhibit 18.8 on p. 686, the Internet facilitates collaboration between par-
ties in the supply chain through a virtual private network. A virtual private network is
similar to a VAN, but is hosted on a third party&rsquo;s website and server, and does not re-
quire any significant investment on the part of either buyer or supplier. Instead of hav-
ing to invest in a significant amount of hard technology, a supplier can be connected to
a large customer through EDI simply by having a computer, a modem, and software. In
other cases, a T1 line may be used to transmit higher volumes of data. A T1 line is a
high-speed optical network line that enables quicker response time when a user goes on-
line. Ford, for example, has offered to connect their suppliers to the Internet for as little
as $8 a month, which they recover in improved communication with their supply base.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example to see the way this system works. Suppose a supplier
wishes to notify a customer that it is shipping an order. First, a local Internet service
provider creates a virtual private tunnel using tunneling protocols&mdash;essentially the al-
phabet and rules of grammar that allow different systems to work together&mdash;includ-
ing PPTP, L@F, L2TP, and others, which may be clustered around different industry
groups. For example, many high-tech companies have adopted rosettanet (http://
www.rosettanet.org), whereas U.S. automotive companies are adopting protocols es-
tablished by the Automotive Industry Action Group (http://www.aiag.org). Using this
protocol, data are transferred over the Internet from the supplier to the customer&rsquo;s
router at its headquarters. The router at headquarters strips off the tunneling proto-
cols and forwards transmission to a local area network and then to the right in-
dividuals. When the customer wishes to place an order with the supplier, the reverse
process takes place.
</p>
<p>Internet EDI is certainly an important application providing numerous benefits.
This approach is typically much less expensive than a traditional, hard-wired EDI sys-
tem and presents fewer standards issues, but it also typically requires a common S

<p>platform on either end (e.g., common ERP systems). The tunneling protocol used
helps to address security concerns that users may have when relying on the Internet
to transmit data. However, the true benefits of the Internet go far beyond this. In
fact, the Internet enables buyers and suppliers to achieve a level of collaboration that
extends far beyond EDI technology as it was originally conceived.
</p>
<p>E-Sourcing Suites
E-tools used by purchasers can be used to communicate within and outside the or-
</p>
<p>ganization. As we have studied in previous chapters, a major goal of purchasing is to
communicate effectively with external suppliers to be able to source items; share infor-
mation, forecasts, and updates; make payments; and so on. Traditional information
flows between buyers and suppliers often necessitate a lengthy sequential process com-
posed of multiple steps required to service as well as fulfill the order. Examples of
these information flows include transmission of the product specifications from
buyer to supplier, submission of a bid, acceptance of the contract, inspection and re-
ceiving documents associated with the shipment, accounting audits, and submission
of payment. Some of the problems that occur within these traditional information
flows include increased transaction time, low accuracy due to data-handling errors,
high utilization of staff time and resources, and increased uncertainty in the form of
both mailing and processing delays. E-sourcing tools are defined as a set of tools em-
ployed by supply managers to streamline processes and leverage technology in order
to meet the needs of the organization.6 Supplier relationship management tools are
e-sourcing tools that allow the purchaser to manage the external linkage with suppli-
ers. Although earlier versions of e-sourcing tools were directed more toward process

<p>efficiencies (streamlining the purchase order process), SRM tools are focused on man-
aging the entire purchasing cycle from recognition of need through contract manage-
ment and supplier evaluation. Prior to discussing SRM tools, we will cover some of
the basic e-sourcing tools.
</p>
<p>E-Sourcing Basics
</p>
<p>E-Sourcing Models
There are basically three major types of e-sourcing business models: (1) sell-side
</p>
<p>systems, (2) buy-side systems, and (3) third-party marketplaces. A brief explanation
of each is presented in the following paragraphs.
</p>
<p>Sell-side systems contain the products or services of one or more suppliers. Registra-
tion on sell-side sites is usually free and the supplier guarantees the security of the
site.7 Most suppliers today have a web presence and many offer the ability to place or-
ders on their sites. Sell-side systems have the advantages of no investment by the
buyer, ease of access, and the availability of many suppliers. Drawbacks include the in-
ability to track or control spending by the buying organization and varying degrees
of security.8 A much-used sell-side site in the MRO area is www.grainger.com.
</p>
<p>Buy-side systems are controlled by buyers and are tied into their intranets and extra-
nets. These buy-side systems can be self-developed or acquired through third-party
software providers of e-sourcing suites.9 Buy-side systems allow the supply manager
to manage the sourcing cycle, track spend, and exert control over contract manage-
ment, in a secure environment. They do require an investment by the buying organi-
zation and need periodic updating as well as training for users. They are the
dominant form of e-sourcing systems used by organizations today.
</p>
<p>Third-party marketplaces are independent firms that neither buy nor sell goods but
seek to facilitate the electronic purchasing process through value enhancement. These
organizations proliferated during the dot boom era of 1999&ndash;2001. Essentially, they
sought to be an electronic marketplace for the needs of organizational purchasers.
Their idea was to bring buyers and sellers together in cyberspace the way Amazon.com
did in the consumer world. One group specialized in a commodity such as chemicals
or steel; they were termed vertical portals. The other group provided a broad category of
services, e.g., office supplies or MRO items; they were called horizontal portals. The value
of most of these horizontal portal models faded as traditional business firms developed
a web presence through sell-side sites (e.g., officedepot.com and mcmastercarr.com).
Some specialized vertical portals survived and evolved and provide value through their
superior market knowledge. One example is http://www.paperexchange.com.pk/, a firm
that serves the worldwide market for pulp and paper. Others such as newview.com, for-
merly esteel.com, have survived by developing and marketing software to the industries
they formerly served.
</p>
<p>Supplier Relationship Management
SRM systems are typically organized around specific modules that interact with dif-
</p>
<p>ferent elements of the purchasing database, elements of the enterprise resource sys-
tem, and integration of data obtained through external EDI or Internet-based
communications with suppliers or customers. Although ERP systems such as SAP
and Oracle generally manage the internal transactions that take place in processing

<p>invoices and purchase orders (as described in Chapter 2), e-sourcing systems are fo-
cused on decision support around a broader group of transactions that are specific to
certain business processes.
</p>
<p>SRM systems have capabilities to allow purchasers to make improved decisions.
Decision support systems use both data and structured mathematical models to sup-
port the decision-making process. A set of SRM sourcing modules act as an interac-
tive system designed to support purchasing managers in making effective decisions
concerning supplier selection, contract management, contract compliance, and so on.
</p>
<p>This section describes some typical characteristics of SRM systems, which may nev-
ertheless be used by all functions in the organization. We have classified the primary
forms of e-sourcing/supply systems as follows:
</p>
<p>&bull; Spend analysis
</p>
<p>&bull; Sourcing
</p>
<p>&bull; Request for quotation processing
</p>
<p>&bull; Reverse auctions (R/As)
</p>
<p>&bull; Bid optimization
</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiation and total cost support
</p>
<p>&bull; Purchase order issuance
</p>
<p>&bull; Receiving and inspection
</p>
<p>&bull; Contract management and compliance
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier performance measurement and control
</p>
<p>&bull; Total cost reporting
</p>
<p>&bull; Price forecasting
</p>
<p>Spend Analysis
Spend analysis is the determination of the dollar amount and volume of ex-
</p>
<p>penditures that an organization makes to provide its products and services and support
its operations. The goal of spend analysis is to determine what goods and services are
purchased, what suppliers they are purchased from, and where the demand for the
items originates in the organization. Once a baseline of spending is established, the orga-
nization can effectively look at opportunities to reduce spending. Such spending reduc-
tion occurs through multiple strategies such as (1) consolidation of similar purchases;
(2) reduction in the number of suppliers; (3) reduction of maverick spend; (4) reduc-
tion of spend by other departments such as human resources, marketing, and finance;
(5) increased use of more efficient contracting methods; and (6) the development of con-
tracting methods to reduce risk and increase supply assurance.
</p>
<p>Spend analysis data is usually derived from a combination of existing purchase or-
ders and accounts payables records. Typically, organizations (1) collect at least one
year of spend data, (2) develop similar categories of spend, (3) assign spend to the cat-
egories, and (4) develop various strategies. Once collected, these data are entered into
the spend analysis module and can be analyzed in an unlimited number of ways.
</p>
<p>Sourcing
Sourcing modules usually contain several phases of the sourcing process, including
</p>
<p>the request for quotation (RFQ), reverse auctions, e-bid optimization, e-purchase or-
der issuance, and receiving and inspection.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Request for Quotation
The request for quotation module is the direct responsibility of purchasing. Most
</p>
<p>software providers call this process the eRFx module. The eRFx module includes a re-
quest for information, request for proposal, and request for quotation. Because differ-
ent organizations have alternate uses for these terms, we will use &ldquo;RFQ&rdquo; as our term
for the quotation module.
</p>
<p>An RFQ is a request to submit a proposal based on a set of specifications provided by
a buyer. This module assists in identifying qualified suppliers to receive RFQ requests.
</p>
<p>This module automatically generates, issues, and tracks the progress of the RFQs
throughout the system. Usually the buyer has a strategy underlying the RFQ that will
be facilitated by the software.
</p>
<p>E-Bid Optimization
E-bid optimization is a software tool that extends the traditional bid process to per-
</p>
<p>mit suppliers to configure their bids in any number of alternative ways. The flexible
bidding process is often termed expressive bidding because suppliers can bid in ways
that emphasize their strengths. Traditionally, suppliers have had to quote per the buy-
er&rsquo;s request or the bid would be ruled nonresponsive. E-bid optimization is an ad-
vanced sourcing solution that provides a tool for buyers to increase their analytical
capabilities in reviewing bids and in realizing more optimal solutions. This software
module uses a basic set of mathematical algorithms to assist a buyer when evaluating
different supply and cost scenarios.

</p>
<p>Reverse Auctions
Of all the technologies that have impacted e-sourcing, none are more publicized
</p>
<p>or controversial than reverse auctions. Suppliers claim that buyers evaluate them
solely on price and forget all the other nonprice benefits they have provided over
time. This need not be the case; Sourcing Snapshot: Reverse Auctions and Buyer-
Seller Relationships summarizes research that shows that buyers can use reverse auc-
tions and have relationships with suppliers. Reverse auctions are electronic processes
where multiple sellers of a product are vying for the business of a single buyer, result-
ing in the price being driven down. Bidding continues until a pre-established bidding
period ends or until no seller is willing to bid any lower, whichever comes first. In a
regular reverse auction, prices are revealed to all sellers; however, the identity of the
competitors remains anonymous. In a rank reverse auction, sellers are only told their
relative rank and thus are not aware of their competitors&rsquo; prices.
</p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged by buyers that reverse auctions have led to significant
cost savings for various buying requirements. The reverse auction tool inexpensively
connects buyers and sellers worldwide and supports competitive bidding while driv-
ing the price of the item to its true market value.
</p>
<p>It is very critical that the reverse auction tool be well integrated with the strategic
sourcing process to harness its full potential. The procurement process should be ro-
bust to adapt to any changes, incorporate financial controls, drive down costs, and
eliminate waste. A successful e-auction requires the development of a preauction

<p>Sourcing
Snapshot
</p>
<p>Reverse Auctions and
Buyer-Seller Relationships
</p>
<p>Reverse auctions (R/As) have been used in the sourcing process since the mid-1990s,
bursting onto the scene led by a new Pittsburgh-based venture appropriately named Free Mar-
kets. Suddenly, buyers had a new tool to establish prices during the bidding cycle.
</p>
<p>Essentially, a reverse auction is a buyer-initiated bidding event utilizing electronic software
that permits price or rank visibility to sellers. The process is conducted in a secure, online en-
vironment within a specified time frame with the goal of obtaining a rational market price
for the commodity or service being procured. The reverse auction has been touted as a
means of reducing the time associated with the supplier selection and award process. One
of the major benefits of the time savings associated with reverse auction use is the ability
of the supply management professional to devote more effort to strategic sourcing activities.
Some of these activities include making in- and outsourcing decisions, strategic cost manage-
ment, benchmarking, and supplier development. In addition, it is commonly held that the
use of reverse auctions results in a reduction in prices paid for products and services.
</p>
<p>Despite the proposed benefits associated with reverse auction technology, managers and aca-
demicians alike have expressed concern regarding how its use impacts, and is impacted by,
buyer-supplier relationships. Some fear the use of reverse auctions tells suppliers that the
buying firm is simply looking to extract price reductions without regard to existing or future
business relationships, thereby breeding mistrust and lack of cooperation.
</p>
<p>Research with 142 experienced purchasing managers (averaging 12 years of experience) was
recently conducted to assess the impact of R/As on relationships. The respondents&rsquo; annual
sales ranged from $4.5 million to $45 billion. Total annual purchase expenditures ranged
from $1 million to $17 billion. Respondents reported more than 30 different lines of busi-
ness. Forty-one percent of the sample were managers, which is indicative of their experience
level; 59% of the sample were nonmanagers. All had experience with reverse auction use, av-
eraging 22 reverse auctions. Respondents used reverse auctions fairly consistently for both
standardized direct materials and indirects (MRO, services, and so on).
</p>
<p>The research provided some positive results related to a major concern that reverse auctions
threaten buyer-supplier relationships. The results suggest that firms that place higher levels
of strategic importance on the relationships with their suppliers opt for relational-type struc-
tures to govern the subsequent contract. This supports previous writings that indicate that
the offer and execution stages of the reverse auction process should be independent.
</p>
<p>In the offer phase of the reverse auction process, explaining the rules accurately to the par-
ties, prior to conducting the actual R/A event, increases the chances of a successful reverse
auction. Once the R/A has been completed, the selection of the appropriate form of contract
to govern the relationship becomes an independent decision. Thus, purchasers must evaluate
the strategic importance of their existing supplier relationship prior to using a reverse auc-
tion, clearly explain the rules of the engagement, and establish the appropriate contract
form after completing the R/A and selecting the desired supplier.
</p>
<p>Price should be a very important element of the R/A selection process but not the only one.
The research supports a relational approach when using reverse auctions for relationships
that are strategically important.
</p>
<p>Supplier cooperation was significantly related to a relational type of contract structure when
using reverse auctions. It appears that the supplier&rsquo;s level of cooperation is contingent, atS

<p>strategy, which sets goals, targets specific potential partners, and clearly lays out the
applicable rules to be followed throughout. The process normally follows these loose
steps:10
</p>
<p>1. The purchasing company decides which contracts (products, materials, ser-
vices) would benefit from reverse auction procurement.
</p>
<p>2. Suppliers are initially evaluated and invited to participate in the bidding pro-
cess. The list of suppliers contains companies formally accepted through qual-
ity and performance criteria, along with potential suppliers that have been
</p>
<p>least in part, upon its expectation of continued interaction with the buying firm. When both
parties involved in a business relationship expected it to last for an extended period of time,
the relationship was characterized by a pattern of cooperation.
</p>
<p>Price is the most controversial element of the reverse auction phenomenon. The research
strongly supported the view that relational contract structures are negatively related to pur-
chase price reduction. Organizations pursuing a more market-based (bid-and-buy) approach
will realize greater savings using reverse auctions than those looking to develop or maintain
relationships. Consequently, firms must assess the tradeoff between obtaining lower prices
(that may or may not be sustainable) and the opportunity cost of not choosing suppliers that
can provide assistance in vital non-price-related areas (e.g., product design) when designing
the appropriate R/A structure.
</p>
<p>The use of reverse auctions will provide the buyer time savings, which could be used to pur-
sue higher value-added or more strategic activities. However, these additional time savings
will be mitigated by the increased time required to build and maintain relationships. Given
the need to perform more value-added duties, purchasers must carefully select suppliers
with whom they enter into relational governance. What the purchaser chooses to do with the
time savings realized by reverse auction use is important because employing a relational
form of governance structure is time consuming. Consequently, not all suppliers can be man-
aged using a relational approach. Many reverse auctions will continue to be conducted for
the sole purpose of obtaining lower prices and will be governed in an arm&rsquo;s-length manner.
</p>
<p>Overall, the research model has demonstrated that purchasers can implement relational gover-
nance mechanisms and still use reverse auctions. These relational governance mechanisms
will ensure increased levels of supplier cooperation. However, this increased cooperation
comes at a cost to the buyer: lower purchase price savings and time savings. If the time sav-
ings attributed to reverse auction use is dedicated to building improved relationships, which
ultimately lead to lower costs, better service, and higher quality, then both parties win.
</p>
<p>Conversely, if the purchaser uses reverse auctions to pursue a more market-based bid-and-buy
strategy, firms will benefit from increased purchase price savings and realize greater time sav-
ings, but this will be at the expense of supplier cooperation. Hence, much of this time savings
may be used to monitor the supplier&rsquo;s performance to ensure that the actual savings attributed
to reduced purchases prices are realized. Overall, much of the interest in reverse auctions is
due to their ability to result in price reductions for the buying firm; the model indicates there
are relational benefits that may outweigh temporary reductions in purchase price.

<p>researched and approved. Oftentimes the market research is conducted by the
website hosting the reverse auction.
</p>
<p>3. The company writes the request for quotation and sends it through e-mail to
all qualified suppliers. Accompanying the RFQ is other pertinent information
such as when and where the bidding will take place and auctioning rules and
etiquette.
</p>
<p>4. The bidding process begins at a certain time and usually lasts no more than
30 minutes. This portion can be open, where all competitors can see other
bids, or it can be closed, where buyers are not able to see other bids. The sup-
plier identities are always kept confidential during bidding.
</p>
<p>5. The company then analyzes the auction and awards the business to the cho-
sen supplier. This supplier is not necessarily the lowest bidder.
</p>
<p>Reverse auction technology is readily available today from a number of sources. It
can be self-service, where the technology is downloaded from the software provider;
the buying organization trains the suppliers, sets up the auction, and conducts it by it-
self. A software provider full-service model is also available. In this model the soft-
ware provider helps the organization with selection of the commodity, assists in
qualifying suppliers, conducts training, and runs the reverse auction for the firm. The
relative level of experience with reverse auctions is the single most important factor
in whether to use a self-service or full-service model.
</p>
<p>Negotiation and Total Cost Support Models
Different e-sourcing systems can aid purchasers to estimate the total cost of owner-
</p>
<p>ship for products and services. These models incorporate shipping, freight, duty, im-
ports and tariffs, inventory costs, and quality costs.
</p>
<p>Purchase Order Issuance
This module supports the generation of purchase orders, which involves the auto-
</p>
<p>matic assignment of purchase order numbers for selected items along with the trans-
fer of purchase order information to the proper database(s). This module provides
purchasing with visibility to current purchase orders on file.
</p>
<p>Receiving and Inspection
The receiving and inspection module updates system records upon receipt of an
</p>
<p>item. Most systems hold a received item in a protected state (unavailable for use) un-
til all inbound processing is complete. Sophisticated systems are able to do this via a
bar code reader that automatically transmits all necessary information to the data-
base. This processing includes tasks such as inspection (if required), material transfer,
and stockkeeping. Systems can also send alerts to key stakeholders when there are po-
tential stockouts or imminent shortages.
</p>
<p>Contract Management and Compliance
Contract management and compliance provides oversight of the back end of the
</p>
<p>sourcing process. Once a source is selected and the contract terms negotiated, there
is a need to manage the contract to ensure that suppliers and users are in compliance
with established contract terms. Other challenges faced with manual contract manage-
ment systems are pricing compliance; changes in terms, volume discount thresholds,

<p>payment schedules, and due dates; and contingencies for nonperformance. Reliable
contract management systems provide the ability to keep these issues current with
real-time data collection capabilities. These real-time capabilities ensure that the buy-
ing organization will realize the full potential of the negotiated terms of the contract.
</p>
<p>Software provider Emptoris describes its contract management tool as combining
powerful contract authoring, negotiation, and approval processes with contract adminis-
tration, enterprise reporting, and proven controls, in an easy-to use interface. It enables
companies to optimize contract management processes while managing payment obliga-
tions and capitalizing on profit opportunities to ensure that supplier management strate-
gies are achieving their full potential.11
</p>
<p>Supplier Performance Measurement and Control
This module provides visibility to open-item status, and measures and analyzes
</p>
<p>supplier performance. Electronic supplier scorecards may also be updated electroni-
cally. The key features include automatic inquiry of item status, monitoring of order
due dates, and analysis of supplier performance. This module should have the capabil-
ity to monitor planned receipts against due dates, provide immediate visibility to
past-due items, and flag those items likely to become past due. The system should gen-
erate summary reports of supplier performance compared against predetermined per-
formance criteria, which may include due-date compliance, quality ratings, price
variances, quantity discrepancies, and total transportation charges.
</p>
<p>Key performance indicators are developed that can highlight hidden additional
costs created by poor quality, delivery, and service issues. Supplier performance mod-
ules provide several benefits including (1) input into supplier selection considering to-
tal costs, not just price; (2) isolating supplier process inefficiencies; (3) improving
total cycle times; and (4) providing suppliers with reliable feedback on their historical
performance.
</p>
<p>Total Cost Reporting
A well-designed e-sourcing system has the ability to generate timely management
</p>
<p>reports, providing visibility to the entire materials process. In creating these total cost
reports, more and more companies are turning to data warehouses (described
earlier).
</p>
<p>Most systems have the capability to generate new reports, assuming data are avail-
able or can be generated by using other data. Another capability of a well-designed
system is that the frequency of data reporting and system updating matches a user&rsquo;s
operational needs. A system that operates in a real-time environment provides the
most current data. Real-time updating is a process in which all data files that include a
specific address are automatically updated within the system. In contrast to real-time
updating is the data bucket&mdash;a process of storing each transaction in a temporary file
and updating the system at scheduled times throughout the day or on a weekly basis.
Batch updating refers to the process of downloading all data buckets into the main sys-
tem on a regularly scheduled basis.
</p>
<p>Price Forecasting
Price forecasting requires the construction of a model to identify the variables af-
</p>
<p>fecting an item&rsquo;s price, including the length of an item&rsquo;s product life cycle, the life cy-
cle stage the item is in, and the item&rsquo;s price history. Life cycle cost curves can

<p>E-Sourcing and Supply: Fully Integrated Systems12
Although we discussed ERP systems and e-sourcing systems separately in this
</p>
<p>chapter, it would be a mistake for readers to think that these systems are already inte-
grated. ERP systems often work independently of decisions made by managers using
the web to order materials and transmit forecasts. In the future, we will see a change,
with increased integration between standalone ERP systems, the systems used to make
decisions on sourcing strategies, and the systems that communicate information along
the supply chain between customers and the buying organization and its suppliers. We
are likely to witness a convergence of customer-focused applications that link suppliers
with internal production schedules and production schedules between different plants
in a single enterprise.
</p>
<p>Requirements between plants will be consolidated and communicated to suppliers
via a supply chain planning module, and these schedules will be linked forward to cus-
tomers. Sales representatives in the field will be able to promise exact delivery dates
to customers using an available-to-promise module, a system that allows salespeople
to access plant schedules and determine if enough capacity is available to produce
the product for the customer by a certain date, and also whether suppliers will be
able to deliver the materials in time to produce it.
</p>
<p>In addition, we may see other modules facilitate transactions between buyers and
suppliers. A distribution planning module will help identify the transportation require-
ments and distribution center inventory levels in time to meet customers&rsquo; delivery
requirements. A demand planning module will help identify whether long-term capac-
ity requirements will be sufficient to meet the demand for new products coming on-
stream. Finally, a supplier collaboration module will help ensure that future supplier
capacity requirements will be in place to meet future demand requirements for new
products and services. In effect, these linked systems will enable a single view of the
entire supply chain. Managers can analyze the factory and the supply chain simul-
taneously, and synchronize demand and supply. Distribution centers will act as a
shock absorber for customer demand variability and will help to facilitate stable pro-
duction schedules at the plants, thereby collapsing the cycles. These types of systems
are only now beginning to emerge. Sourcing Snapshot: The Top 10 Emerging Tech-
nologies in Supply Management discusses some of the exciting new emerging tech-
nologies that will begin to be available to sourcing professionals in the coming years.
</p>
<p>One of the most important elements that will lead to the success of e-supply chain
applications is the concept of information visibility. We will discuss the types of sys-
tems that enable supply chain information visibility in the remainder of the chapter.
</p>
<p>What Is Information Visibility?
Information visibility within the supply chain is the process of sharing critical
</p>
<p>data required to manage the flow of products, services, and information in real time
between suppliers and customers. If information is available but cannot be accessed
by the parties most able to react to a given situation, its value degrades exponentially.

Snapshot
</p>
<p>The Top 10 Emerging
Technologies in Supply
Management
</p>
<p>Pierre Mitchell of the Hackett Group, in a recent presentation, highlighted 10 emerging
technologies for supply management. His top 10 are listed below:
</p>
<p>&bull; CRM for procurement
&bull; Guided buying
&bull; Advanced supply planning
&bull; Win-win sourcing optimization
&bull; Design for supply
&bull; Content-enabled analytics
&bull; Portfolio management
&bull; Knowledge networking
&bull; Open systems
&bull; Software as a service
</p>
<p>CRM for procurement is a process and set of tools to help supply managers better serve
their internal customers. It includes tools such as project planning and scheduling, customer
self-service and training, service-level agreements, and customer satisfaction measurement
tools. These tools will help supply managers align themselves around the originators of the
spend rather than just the supply markets. Users get exactly what they need from suppliers
and the supply organization itself.
</p>
<p>Guided buying is an e-tool that combines ERP and e-purchasing systems with virtual cata-
logs, search engines, and web agents to help guide employees to preferred sources of supply
and to preferred sourcing processes and personnel. This almost Google-like technology will
contain elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and will become smarter over time.
</p>
<p>Advanced supply planning tools provide a linkage from sales and operations plans to sup-
ply planning and back again. This includes translating demand (volumes and variability) up-
stream across multiple tiers of the supply chain and improves risk analysis, decisions on
hedging tactics, and other supply tradeoff analyses (e.g., make vs. buy, transportation, inven-
tory). It would also identify bottleneck items and their potential impact on revenue and prof-
its (i.e., not just costs).
</p>
<p>Win-win sourcing optimization techniques and supporting tools allow suppliers to better
match their capabilities with those of the buying firm and create more win-win scenarios
and fewer win-lose ones. Rather than using a winner-take-all bidding process geared toward
price or cost, or having the buyer guess which lots to create for different suppliers, it allows
buyers to open up their market baskets to suppliers that can then do their own demand man-
agement to flexibly bid (i.e., choose the multivariate line items that they can best compete
on) in order to harness their best capabilities and put their best foot forward, passing on
their optimized cost structures to the buyers. This allows true capability discovery versus just
forced price discovery in traditional closed bidding or reverse auction formats. (Note: Expres-
sive bidding is covered in this chapter under e-bidding optimization.)
</p>
<p>Design for supply is an extension of the product life cycle management process and pro-
vides a set of decision support tools to evaluate and manage the early design and sourcing
cycles. It allows better reuse of existing designs, evaluation of new or alternative designs,
and the ability to assess the cost and feasibility of those designs with respect to the up-
stream manufacturing and logistics capabilities of internal and external suppliers.

<p>Increasing information visibility among supply chain participants can help all parties
reach their overall goal of increased stockholder value through revenue growth, asset uti-
lization, and cost reduction. To improve responsiveness across their supply chains, com-
panies are exploring the use of collaborative models that share information across
multiple tiers of participants in the supply chain: from their supplier&rsquo;s supplier to their
customer&rsquo;s customer. These trading partners need to share forecasts, manage invento-
ries, schedule labor, and optimize deliveries, and in so doing they reduce costs, im-
prove productivity, and create greater value for the final customer in the chain.
Software programs for business process optimization and for collaborative planning,
forecasting, and replenishment are evolving to help companies forecast and plan
among partners, manage customer relations, and improve product life cycles and main-
tenance. Traditional supply chains are rapidly evolving into &ldquo;dynamic trading net-
works&rdquo;13 comprised of groups of independent business units that share planning and
execution information to satisfy demand with an immediate, coordinated response.
</p>
<p>Some of the considerations that must be planned for in implementing an informa-
tion visibility system include the size of the supply base and customer base with which
</p>
<p>Content-enabled analytics are decision support tools that marry internal supply planning
processes with external supplier or market data. These tools would allow the supply manager
to do predictive analyses such as price or cost forecasting, profitability planning, and sup-
plier or market risk analysis.
</p>
<p>Portfolio management is the process of periodically assessing the software tools and
packages that the supply organization possesses. An assessment is then made of the useful-
ness, degree of use, and capacity of the current systems. Older software packages and those
no longer being used will be discontinued. Future needs and newer tools will be evaluated
for potential acquisition.
</p>
<p>Knowledge networking is the process of using Internet-based collaboration tools and ser-
vices to better capture and disseminate supply knowledge both internally and externally. It
supports the capture and sharing of commodity knowledge or supply best practices in an inter-
nal community of experts, an external community of peers, or a buyers&rsquo; supply chain (i.e., shar-
ing best practices with and among suppliers).
</p>
<p>Open systems e-tools allow internal and external technology providers to provide supply
managers with quickly developed customized applications that interoperate with software ap-
plication suites from independent software vendors (ISVs) like SAP and Oracle. The tools them-
selves can be open-source products (e.g., Coupa is an open-source e-procurement vendor),
software that is hosted as a service to provide a certain specific function (e.g., providing a
list of potential suppliers based on a commodity code and region), or products that utilize
standardized integration over the Internet to harness the specific functionality from applica-
tions developed by the ISVs or by the buying firm.
</p>
<p>Software as a service is broader term that includes on-demand software that is provided
as a hosted Internet service rather than software code shipped on a CD. It is being driven by
customers&rsquo; needs for cheaper and more quickly upgradeable applications. It is putting compet-
itive pressures on large independent software vendors to provide more cost-effective and mod-
ularized solutions.

<p>to share information, the criteria for implementation, the content of information
shared, and the technology used to share it. Clarifying these issues will help to ensure
that all participants have access to the information required to effectively control the
flow of materials, manage the level of inventory, fulfill service-level agreements, and
meet quality standards as agreed upon in the relationship performance metrics.
</p>
<p>Dell&rsquo;s Information Visibility System: The Benchmark
Perhaps no other company has been as successful in implementing information vis-
</p>
<p>ibility as a competitive strategy as Dell Computer. Dell has fulfilled its commitments
to customers through the company&rsquo;s direct model, in which it holds only hours of in-
ventory yet promises customers lead times of five days. Component suppliers that
wish to do business with Dell have to hold some level of inventory, because their cy-
cle times are typically much longer than Dell&rsquo;s.14 For example, if a supplier has a
lead time of 45 days and Dell is promising online customers a lead time of 5 days
from order placement to delivery, the supplier must have real-time information to
meet Dell&rsquo;s strict demands.
</p>
<p>Dell has developed a business model that features a lean, build-to-order manufactur-
ing operation. By utilizing the Web, Dell provides its supplier with forecasting informa-
tion and receives information about the supplier&rsquo;s ability to meet the forecasts. Dell
uses i2 Technologies products for demand-fulfillment operations and products from Ag-
ile Software for engineering change orders and bill-of-materials management. Commu-
nication about engineering changes, component availability, and capacity (in addition
to forecasting and inventory data) flows both ways between Dell and its suppliers.
</p>
<p>Dell is also able to review suppliers and place web-based orders in their factories in
hours. After outsourcing to third-party contract manufacturers, Dell executives realized
that many of these manufacturers did not have adequate visibility of customer orders.
This was a major driver in the initiative to increase visibility of orders. Dell&rsquo;s build-to-or-
der web-based customer model has become the benchmark for other industries, and or-
ganizations such as General Motors, Ford, and General Electric are seeking to create
build-to-order models using the Web as the platform for taking customer orders.
</p>
<p>Benefits of Information Visibility
Information regarding forecasts, changes in production schedule levels, and ongo-
</p>
<p>ing supply chain performance metrics needs to be conveyed by customers to suppli-
ers on a regular basis. Information flows from suppliers to customers can include
current order lead times, capacity levels, order status, and inventory levels. There are
many benefits of having parties receive this information. Receiving and conveying the
correct information will ensure that the suppliers are aware of what needs to be pro-
duced while, at the same time, the buying firm is sure that it is possible to receive or-
dered quantities on time, every time.
</p>
<p>The most important benefit of a visibility system is not that the system is able to
correct a supply chain problem, but that it allows people to become aware of prob-
lems earlier and thus take corrective actions more quickly than they would otherwise.
The benefits of information visibility include reduced lead times, improved constraint
management, better decision making, lower costs, and increased profits. Although pro-
blems such as shortages, changes in customer orders, engineering changes, obsolete in-
ventory, and equipment failures can still occur with a visibility system in place, the
effects of these problems are less than if the participants in the supply chain were not

<p>made aware of these problems until a later date. In other words, without visibility sys-
tems, a $5,000 problem could turn into a $500,000 problem.
</p>
<p>When implemented properly, a visibility solution results in the following addi-
tional benefits that promote improved supply chain performance:
</p>
<p>&bull; Breaks organizational barriers and enables sharing of mission-critical infor-
mation about business activities and interaction on a near-real-time basis
across the supply chain.
</p>
<p>&bull; Builds visibility into the supply chain and provides people with a real-time
snapshot of supply chain performance metrics.
</p>
<p>&bull; Manages by metrics, aligns performance metrics with cross-organizational
business processes, and assigns ownership of processes and metrics to spe-
cific individuals.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduces the decision cycle process and allows an upstream or downstream
participant to respond to market or customer demand in hours or days, not
weeks or months.
</p>
<p>&bull; Encourages decision-making collaboration and facilitates the ability to make
decisions collaboratively on the Internet, bringing relevant internal and exter-
nal stakeholders into the process.
</p>
<p>&bull; Reduces opportunity and problem resolution latency, and measures and
monitors supply chain activities iteratively, allowing people to quickly re-
spond to events as they occur.
</p>
<p>Conversely, the dangers of poor execution of supply chain processes include in-
creased lead and cycle times, higher costs, and less informed decision making. For exam-
ple, in the semiconductor industry, a lack of visibility across the supply chain, coupled
with inaccurate supply-and-demand forecasting, is hurting the industry&rsquo;s ability to
promptly deliver products, efficiently spend capital, and properly manage inventory.15

</p>
<p>The following is a case example addressing the deployment of an information visibility
system, as described by a large first-tier U.S. supplier to the automotive industry.
</p>
<p>MOTIVATION FOR INVESTMENT
In the words of the project manager responsible for implementing this system: &ldquo;We were look-
ing for a tool that gets our company and its supply chain connected via the Internet. We
needed to align our supply chain with a simple tool to get our feet wet and start to prepare
for the new automotive supply chain: the 10-day car. Information will need to be shared
quickly to establish a supply chain to support a one-piece flow. The initial tool is expected to
do the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a view of the same information to suppliers and the company
&bull; Display inventory status, schedules, history of transactions
&bull; Provide a reporting capability
&bull; Display alerts to exceptions

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Communicate replenishment triggers
&bull; Rate suppliers
&bull; Support the next generation for EDI
&bull; Display logistics information
</p>
<p>Some of the benefits they hoped to achieve by implementing the system included the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Increased customer satisfaction through the supply chain
&bull; Supply chain flexibility
&bull; Decreased inventory
&bull; Decreased number of expediting activities
&bull; Decreased production interruptions or changes
&bull; Increased focus on collaboration and proactive activities
</p>
<p>IMPLEMENTATION
Implementing the process required a series of stages. Several software vendors were initially
reviewed. The company chose to pilot with one, and then a second. The possibility of develop-
ing the software internally was also considered. The criteria used to select the vendor in-
volved several issues. First, purchasing was looking for a provider that wanted to have a
relationship. In the words of the purchasing project manager, &ldquo;We want to use our knowl-
edge of supply chain management to improve the product to benefit us as well as other par-
ticipants across the supply chain. As a result, cost is a major factor in determining the level
of our relationship with our knowledge and their product. We always perform a pilot to let
the provider and us test the product and its value proposition. Another key area for us to con-
sider is the service level that is provided. We now look at application services providers as a
viable option to lessen the load of our internal IT staff. Finally, we decided to proceed with
the pilot. We piloted six sites and about 50 suppliers. After a month, we added three other
sites with the same suppliers. Our second pilot used the same plants with some new suppli-
ers and some in common with the original pilot.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>PILOT PROGRAM
The project manager described the pilot program as follows:
</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our pilot, we implemented the system in two to four weeks, but it really takes a month or
so to get the business processes adjusted and the users familiar with the software. The
amount of training required varied at each location. We utilized centralized training sessions
where it was applicable. Otherwise, we used site training sessions, and some one-on-one ses-
sions. It was a requirement to have hands-on training with all of the individual users in ev-
ery situation. The outcome of doing so is that everyone in the organization saw the value of
information visibility in its simplest form. We realized that a tool is only as good as the busi-
ness process execution in the plant and the standardization and acceptance of the process
across plants. We also learned that one replenishment method would not work in all situa-
tions. Rather, it is better to have several different methods that are executed the same way
across the organization. We also recognized that there were entrenched manual processes
(e.g., releases and ship schedules) in the suppliers&rsquo; business processes and that would be dif-
ficult to change. The system operates effectively in real time as our system is updated.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>BARRIERS AND SOLUTIONS
Several barriers and solutions were encountered along the way, but purchasing was able to
overcome them in the following manner: S

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>&bull; Barrier: Lack of technical expertise in suppliers. Solution: The pilot system was
fairly simple, and the provider as well as the company&rsquo;s IT resources provided
assistance.
</p>
<p>&bull; Barrier: Internal resistance. Solution: Internal resistance was addressed by saying,
&ldquo;This is a pilot and we want to learn about the software, but also want to deter-
mine where our business processes are out of line.&rdquo; In addition, participants were
given the opportunity to have input into the system requirements up front.
</p>
<p>&bull; Barrier: Lack of internal resources. Solution: Lack of internal resources was ad-
dressed by trying to prove with the pilot that with this new business process,
fewer resources would be required. However, this is a constant battle; lack of re-
sources will be a huge issue when looking down the road at full implementation
of the system.
</p>
<p>&bull; Barrier: Lack of top management support and understanding. Solution: The com-
pany had to do several knowledge-sharing events with its leadership group and
some one-on-one sessions as well. It also provides frequent updates on the sta-
tus. This helps to keep executives up to speed on the progress and prevents prob-
lems from occurring.
</p>
<p>&bull; Barrier: Lack of standards in the technology. Solution: The company does not use
a common platform. This is in process, but not complete for the pilot. The big-
gest challenge was the different business processes used across plant locations
and within the plants. Training helped to solve this problem.
</p>
<p>LESSONS LEARNED
Lessons learned from this pilot implementation included the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Top-down support is absolutely critical. People will not participate initially unless
they are told to do so.
</p>
<p>&bull; Involvement from all levels of the organization will also help people to participate
(functional, business unit leadership, plant leadership).
</p>
<p>&bull; Current system transaction processes are not adequate; the company needed to de-
velop new ones.
</p>
<p>&bull; Business process execution must be in place. Without a good business process
that is executed in a consistent manner, the best system in the world will not
solve your problems.

<p>CONCLUSION
Supply managers must expand their use of information technology to increase both
</p>
<p>individual and functional performance. The use of web-based applications, ERP sys-
tems, and e-sourcing systems can help professional buyers shift attention from routine
to strategic tasks. For example, systems that support the making of better supplier selec-
tion decisions&mdash;one of a firm&rsquo;s most strategic tasks&mdash;can reduce or eliminate future sup-
ply-base problems. Also, a system that monitors supplier performance can provide
timely visibility concerning potential supply problems.
</p>
<p>Ordering and implementing new ERP systems requires systematic planning cou-
pled with process and behavioral changes. The final decision about any system usu-
ally represents a long-term commitment to the selected features and equipment.
Supply managers have access to a very broad range of e-sourcing solutions and must
extensively research available tools and software providers and build case studies to
support justification for acquiring these systems. It is important to identify systems
that not only meet current operating requirements but also have capabilities to meet
future needs.
</p>
<p>Emerging technologies are supplementing and in some cases replacing current
technologies. Many of the strategies being pursued within supply chain organizations
will rely on end-to-end supply chain solutions that
</p>
<p>&bull; Integrate suppliers and distributors
</p>
<p>&bull; Share information
</p>
<p>&bull; Link ERP systems to sales personnel in the field
</p>
<p>&bull; Outsource manufacturing and logistics systems
</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate supplier, on-site engineering, and maintenance activities
</p>
<p>These strategies will require new e-business applications to enable information shar-
ing and, most importantly, provide an effective order fulfillment process with rapid
delivery. Although many solutions providers promise these capabilities, in fact they
are extremely difficult to deploy. Moreover, many companies lack the fundamental
supply chain infrastructure required to be able to apply these technologies across mul-
tiple tiers of customers and suppliers.
</p>
<p>To learn to crawl before learning to walk and then run, organizations must ad-
dress the current flawed designs of their existing supply chains and only then build
these applications around their re-engineered networks. An e-sourcing application
cannot fix the problems associated with an unmanaged or poorly performing supply
base, characterized by adversarial relationships, lack of trust, and an unwillingness to
share information. Success in e-sourcing requires management commitment, supply
management skills that foster strategic sourcing capabilities, key relationship manage-
ment, and changes to outdated processes that have been embedded in the organiza-
tional culture.
</p>
<p>Progressive supply managers should always be looking five years ahead to identify
system trends, operating requirements, and systems applications. For purchasing to
contribute to a firm&rsquo;s performance objectives, it must have the resources and ability
to develop world-class information systems supported by leading-edge technology.

<p>Measuring Purchasing and Supply Performance at a
Global Automotive Parts Manufacturer
</p>
<p>OVERVIEW
This multibillion-dollar diversified manufacturer of electrical and electromechanical compo-
nents and systems has worldwide operations, markets, and suppliers. Purchasing is done at
the corporate, division/business, and regional levels. Global coordination is achieved through
the corporate headquarters in the United States. Major operating locations are in North Amer-
ica, Europe, Asia/Pacific, and South America.
</p>
<p>Purchasing is organized with companywide product and nonproduct purchasing directors re-
porting to the vice president of global purchasing. Global commodity directors and business
unit leaders also report to the vice president or to the product/nonproduct purchasing direc-
tors. Also at corporate headquarters are purchasing staff groups, including lean operations,
organization and employee development, supplier development, supplier quality, minority sup-
plier development, strategic planning, finance, communications, e-systems, strategy and pro-
cess, and risk management.
</p>
<p>Staff number in the hundreds and are located worldwide. Annual spend is in the billions of
dollars. The vice president of global purchasing reports to an executive vice president. The
overall strategic intent of global purchasing is to provide the corporation with a competitive
advantage through achieving extended supply chain performance excellence. Achieving this
extended supply chain excellence on a worldwide basis requires vertical and horizontal inte-
gration, detailed business plans, and an integrated set of metrics to drive and measure
behaviors.
</p>
<p>The measurement system is aligned vertically and horizontally with corporate goals and other
functions and business units through the strategic global purchasing plan. The plan is inte-
grated with the critical competitive requirements through the company&rsquo;s executive commit-
tee. Critical drivers are cost, quality, and availability. In addition, minority purchasing spend,
effective product launches, and a competitive supply base are also important.
</p>
<p>The global purchasing plan is structured around the strategic intent of global purchasing,
and key contributing elements include supplier development, cost, sourcing strategically, qual-
ity, e-systems, people, supplier relations, and accelerated change. Horizontal linkage is
achieved by establishing a multiyear strategy and annual business plans. The strategy and
business plans focus on the current and desired state and link together the corporate, com-
modity, regional, and business unit strategies and plans.
</p>
<p>This strategy and planning process clearly provides for effective communication, project plan-
ning, and horizontal and vertical alignment with goals and resulting measurements. An exten-
sive set of integrated financial and nonfinancial measures are in place to guide behavior
and review performance. The most significant are discussed here.
</p>
<p>COST MANAGEMENT
Two measures are most critical: (1) year-over-year price performance based on contract
prices for the same or similar items, and (2) material cost improvement that can be
achieved through various approaches such as design change, process improvement, packag-
ing, and so forth.
</p>
<p>In addition, the company&rsquo;s overall financial plan includes cost-reduction levels that need to
be achieved by purchasing. Revenues of the firm, as they increase or decrease, influence the
purchasing cost-reduction target because of the need to protect margin. The finance group
makes final judgments regarding validation of purchasing cost savings.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Other important measures in use include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Quality and quality improvement based on parts per million (PPM) defective
determination
</p>
<p>&bull; On-time delivery and availability
&bull; Flawless on-time launch of new products
&bull; Minority supplier spend targets
&bull; &ldquo;Rightsizing&rdquo; the supply base based on an objective measurement of the appropri-
</p>
<p>ate number of suppliers
&bull; Supplier relationships and development via scorecards
&bull; People development based on number of hours of training per year
&bull; Cost management models
&bull; E-system applications
&bull; Lean project
</p>
<p>This company regularly reviews all measures above. Goals and specific targets are modified
regularly, based on business needs. Examples include enhanced cost improvement and flaw-
lessly launching new products to ensure timely introduction to the market.
</p>
<p>Targets can be reset at any time the business requires a change. Reviews are at least
monthly. There is a heavy emphasis on cost improvement. Targets are aggressive in nature,
going beyond what has normally been achieved, and are in place at all purchasing levels
and business units.
</p>
<p>The purchasing performance measures are organized around the eight contributing key ele-
ments identified earlier as part of the global purchasing plan. The strategies by strategy
areas and metrics are in place for the current and future states. The global purchasing busi-
ness plan forces a linkage across the key elements of the corporation, including divisions,
commodity teams, and regional purchasing groups.
</p>
<p>Measured performance is regularly reported to all appropriate personnel companywide. Own-
ers of performance across the company are established at all levels with project plans in
place with appropriate metrics. For example, supplier development may include project steps
and metrics for cost savings, developing supplier engineers, and implementing a supplier
council.
</p>
<p>Personal business priorities, which drive performance, are based primarily on team recogni-
tion rather than personal rewards. However, appraisals are done at the individual level and
people are expected to perform at stretch levels to gain the most significant financial and non-
financial rewards. Incentive compensation is based on overall achievement of the company&rsquo;s
business plan and is primarily awarded at the executive level.
</p>
<p>Significant resources are committed to the global purchasing business planning process and
related measurements. Strategy and process personnel at corporate have lead roles in the
planning process.
</p>
<p>Purchasing personnel across the organization have execution responsibility, with specific per-
sonnel assigned to measurement systems input, data integrity, and enhanced systems devel-
opment. Finance staff work to ensure the accuracy and validity of cost savings. Cost
management personnel are developing cost models against which to evaluate purchasing
and supplier performance.
</p>
<p>Current systems provide significant support for the measurements. Cost and cost improve-
ment are tracked and reported at all organizational levels and by division and product in S

<p>Chapter 19 Performance Measurement and Evaluation 707</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>This chapter begins with a basic overview of performance measurement and evaluation,
including the reasons to measure performance and the problems associated with mea-
surement and evaluation. Next, there is a discussion of the most common purchasing
and supply chain measurement categories, with specific examples of performance mea-
sures presented. The third section discusses the development of a performance measure-
ment and evaluation system. The fourth section discusses performance benchmarking,
which is a process involving comparisons against leading firms to establish perfor-
mance plans and objectives. The next section discusses the balanced scorecard. The
chapter concludes with observations about performance measurement and evaluation.
</p>
<p>Purchasing and Supply Chain Performance
Measurement and Evaluation
</p>
<p>A purchasing and supply chain performance evaluation system represents a formal,
systematic approach to monitor and evaluate purchasing performance. Although this
sounds easy, it is often difficult to develop measures that direct behavior or activity ex-
actly as intended. Some firms still rely on measures that could be harmful, depending
on performance objectives, rather than supporting long-term performance. For exam-
ple, the ability to win significant price concessions from a supplier is still a major objec-
tive for certain price/cost performance measures. However, if a purchaser continually
squeezes short-term price reductions from a supplier, will that supplier have the finan-
cial resources or the commitment to invest in longer-term performance improvements?
</p>
<p>Modern purchasing and supply chain performance measurement and evaluation
systems contain a variety of measures. Most of these measures fall into two broad cate-
gories: effectiveness measures and efficiency measures. Effectiveness refers to the ex-
tent to which, by choosing a certain course of action, management can meet a
previously established goal or standard. Efficiency refers to the relationship between
planned and actual sacrifices made to realize a previously agreed-upon goal.1 Effi-
ciency measures usually relate some input to a performance output.
</p>
<p>considerable detail. Finance validates cost-reduction and purchasing performance to the fi-
nancial plan for both direct and indirect procurement. Various other metrics are provided by
SAP and internal systems models for performance monitoring.
</p>
<p>In addition, e-systems are being enhanced and will include advanced supplier profiling and
scorecards, a supplier suggestion system, and cost management.
</p>
<p>The performance of purchasing (both direct and indirect) is critical to the financial success
of the company. Top executives regularly review the performance of purchasing and the sup-
ply base, with a keen focus on cost, quality, availability, and launch. Companywide and pur-
chasing executives drive the measurement system and critical metrics, using them to guide
behavior and to reward performance.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Almost all measures include a standard or target against which to evaluate perfor-
mance results or outcomes. It is incomplete to say, for example, that a measure will
track improvement in supplier quality. We still need to compare actual improvement
against a pre-established target or objective. Meeting this target, which is presumably
based on world-class performance levels, will bring value to an organization. Each per-
formance measure should include actual performance levels and a targeted perfor-
mance level.
</p>
<p>Why Measure Performance?
There are a number of reasons for measuring and evaluating purchasing and sup-
</p>
<p>ply chain activity and performance.
</p>
<p>Support Better Decision Making
Measurement can lead to better decisions by making performance and results visi-
</p>
<p>ble. It is difficult to develop performance improvement plans without understanding
the areas in which performance falls short. Measurement provides a track record of
purchasing performance over time and directly supports decision-making activity by
management.
</p>
<p>Support Better Communication
Performance measurement can result in better communication across the supply
</p>
<p>chain, including within purchasing, between departments, with suppliers, and with ex-
ecutive management. For example, a purchaser must clearly communicate perfor-
mance expectations to suppliers. The measures that quantify supplier performance
reflect a purchaser&rsquo;s expectations.
</p>
<p>Provide Performance Feedback
Measurement provides the opportunity for performance feedback, which supports
</p>
<p>the prevention or correction of problems identified during the performance measure-
ment process. Feedback also provides insight into how well a buyer, department,
team, or supplier is meeting its performance objectives over time.
</p>
<p>Motivate and Direct Behavior
Measurement motivates and directs behavior toward desired end results. A mea-
</p>
<p>surement system can accomplish this in several ways. First, the selection of perfor-
mance categories and objectives indicates to purchasing personnel those activities
that an organization considers critical. Second, management can motivate and influ-
ence behavior by linking the attainment of performance objectives to organizational
rewards, such as pay increases.
</p>
<p>Problems with Purchasing and Supply Chain
Measurement and Evaluation
</p>
<p>Measuring and evaluating performance, including purchasing and supply chain
performance, historically has had certain problems and limitations. Mark Brown, an
expert on performance measurement, argued that most managers and professionals
today are like a pilot trying to fly a plane with only half the instruments needed and
many additional instruments that measure irrelevant data.2 He states that practically
every organization has some type of problem with its measurement system.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Too Much Data and Wrong Data
Having too much data is the most common problem an organization has with its
</p>
<p>measurement system. A second and more serious problem is that the data that man-
agers pay attention to are often the wrong data. The metrics are selected because of
history or a feeling that the measure is related to success, which may not be the case
at all. In fact, measures that managers follow may sometimes be in conflict with mea-
sures used in other units or functional areas. As a general rule, employees should mon-
itor no more than a dozen measures, with half of those being the most critical.
</p>
<p>Measures That Are Short-Term Focused
Many small- and medium-sized organizations have a problem of relying on mea-
</p>
<p>sures and data that are short-term focused. Typically the only data they collect are finan-
cial and operating data. In purchasing, this would mean a short-term focus on workload
and supply chain activities, while ignoring the longer-range or strategic measures.
</p>
<p>Lack of Detail
At times the data that are reported are summarized so much as to make the infor-
</p>
<p>mation meaningless. A measure that reports on a single measure of monthly supplier
quality probably lacks detail. A supply manager will want to know what are the spe-
cific types of defects the supplier is experiencing, what the defects cost the buyer&rsquo;s
company, and the supplier&rsquo;s quality performance over time.
</p>
<p>An operations manager at a major automotive regional parts distribution facility re-
ceives a monthly measure of the facility&rsquo;s quality as measured by claims made by cus-
tomers. However, he also receives reports that detail the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; The type of errors that are occurring (wrong part picked, damage, shortages,
missed shipments, and so on)
</p>
<p>&bull; Which customers are making the quality claims
</p>
<p>&bull; Which employees are responsible for the quality errors
</p>
<p>&bull; The total cost of the quality claims against the facility
</p>
<p>&bull; The part numbers that have quality claims against them
</p>
<p>With this information the manager can take action that will attack the root causes of
the quality problems at his facility.
</p>
<p>Drive the Wrong Performance
Unfortunately, many measures drive behavior that is not what was intended or
</p>
<p>needed. If buyers are measured on the number of purchase orders written, then they
will make sure to split orders between suppliers to generate as many purchase orders
as possible. Part of this is due to the fact that measuring intellectual work is difficult.
However, organizations still want to look for factors that can be measured and re-
ported. These factors may not, however, always be the right factors.
</p>
<p>Measures of Behavior versus Accomplishments
The problem with measuring behavior is there is no guarantee the behavior will
</p>
<p>lead to desired results. A behavioral measure that tracks the amount of purchase vol-
ume covered by corporatewide contracts, for example, is becoming increasingly

<p>common. A better measure, however, is one that tracks the total savings due to the
use of corporatewide contracts.
</p>
<p>Another example of a behavioral measure is one that measures the number of
meetings held by a commodity team each quarter. A better set of measures will track
the performance results that occurred because of the team&rsquo;s actions. Although some
set of behavioral measures will always be present, measures that capture accomplish-
ments are the ones that really matter.
</p>
<p>Purchasing and Supply Chain Performance
Measurement Categories
</p>
<p>As part of a company-focused purchasing and supply chain measurement ap-
proach, firms should follow a systematic process to maximize results and achieve verti-
cal and horizontal alignment of purpose. Exhibit 19.1 on p. 712 illustrates the
process. As indicated, company objectives drive specific company strategies such as
being the low-cost producer or technology leader. These company strategies should
then drive appropriate and prioritized purchasing and supply chain objectives and
specific strategies.
</p>
<p>Alignment of strategies, measures, and actions will bring together top-down direc-
tion and bottom-up targeting to produce positive contributions. In a single enter-
prise, this could deliver competitive advantage. Integrated purchasing and supply
chain management can also produce competitive advantage for the end-to-end sup-
ply chain level, improving effectiveness and reducing overhead.
</p>
<p>There are hundreds of purchasing and supply chain measures. Perhaps the best
way to summarize the vast number of separate measures is by developing perfor-
mance measurement categories as shown in Exhibit 19.1. Within each category,
many separate measures relate to each general category. Most purchasing and supply
chain measures fall into one of the following categories:
</p>
<p>&bull; Price performance
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost-effectiveness
</p>
<p>&bull; Revenue
</p>
<p>&bull; Quality
</p>
<p>&bull; Time/delivery/responsiveness

<p>Price Performance Measures
Purchasing uses various indicators to evaluate price performance measures&mdash;in
</p>
<p>other words, how effectively it spends purchase dollars. The most common price per-
formance measures include actual purchase price versus planned purchase price com-
parisons, actual purchase price(s) compared to a market index, comparisons of actual
to actual purchase prices for individual and aggregated items between operating
plants or divisions within an organization, and target prices achieved. Two price per-
formance measures that are gaining importance are target prices achieved and price
to market index comparisons.
</p>
<p>Actual Price Compared to Plan
A common price performance measure is the difference between actual and planned
</p>
<p>purchase prices. Measurement of planned purchase price variance can occur at different
organizational levels. One level includes actual versus planned purchases for the total
material budget; this is an aggregated price performance measure. Other levels show
comparisons that provide greater detail.
</p>
<p>For example, purchasing may calculate actual versus planned price variances for
each individual purchased item. Exhibit 19.2 presents various methods for calculating
purchase price variance from a plan.
</p>
<p>Actual Prices versus Market Index
Purchase price versus market index measures provide information about the rela-
</p>
<p>tionship between actual prices and published market prices. These measures are most
appropriate for market-based products where pricing is primarily a function of sup-
ply and demand. This also applies to standard and readily available products. Index

</p>
<p>Various Formats for Measuring Purchase Price Variance
</p>
<p>1. Purchase price variance = Actual price &minus; Planned price

<p>Price Comparisons between Operations
Actual prices for similar items are also compared between plants, divisions, or busi-
</p>
<p>ness units. These comparisons provide an opportunity to identify purchase price dif-
ferences within a firm. This provides visibility as to which unit is negotiating or
securing the best purchase price. The comparison activity can also help identify com-
monly purchased items between units for purchase consolidation. A number of firms
also attempt actual-to-actual price comparisons between companies to determine true
price competitiveness.

<p>The Tight Squeeze
at Chrysler
</p>
<p>Sales representatives from Detroit-area auto suppliers have been complaining about
the cost-cutting pressure coming from the U.S. unit of DaimlerChrysler, which is hurting the
cooperative relationships that existed between suppliers and the automotive manufacturer.
During the 1990s, Chrysler extensively measured the savings generated from supplier-
provided ideas. Now, facing lower sales, high rebate costs, and the cost of launching new ve-
hicles, DaimlerChrysler announced a $600 million quarterly loss at its Chrysler unit. The red
ink will likely increase the pressure at Chrysler to cut more than $2 billion as part of a $5.7
billion corporate belt-tightening. A supplier doing $300 million in business with Chrysler will
now have to find an extra $3 million, and many suppliers are already struggling with razor-
thin margins. Premerger Chrysler was renowned for working closely with its suppliers and re-
ceived an enthusiastic response as new products were jointly developed that helped reduce
Chrysler&rsquo;s manufacturing costs. By 1998, this strategy had helped Chrysler measure up as
one of the lowest-cost producers in the world, with the highest profits per vehicle.
</p>
<p>One supplier, complaining about the shift in performance metrics, suggested that his com-
pany may market its best technology to other automakers if the trend continues.
</p>
<p>And that is a cost that Chrysler can ill afford.

<p>714 Part 5 Critical Supply Chain Elements</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>performance measures are also commonly used when purchasing raw materials,
other commodity or standard-type items, components, systems, and contract services.
</p>
<p>Target Prices Achieved
Target pricing is the process of determining what the external customer is willing
</p>
<p>to pay for a product or service and then assigning specific cost targets to the compo-
nents, assemblies, and systems that make up the product or service. Target costing
uses the following formula to determine allowable costs:
</p>
<p>Target Price &minus; Profit Target &frac14; Allowable Cost
Allowable cost is then allocated to various elements that make up the final product
or service.
</p>
<p>Cost-Effectiveness Measures
The measures in this category focus attention on efforts to reduce purchase costs.
</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness measures fall into two general categories: cost changes and cost
avoidance. The use of cost-effectiveness measures requires a word of caution. The
method used to achieve cost reductions is critical. A cost reduction based on mutual
cooperation is the same, on paper, as a cost reduction resulting from heavy-handed
pressure on a supplier. Although the end result (i.e., a cost reduction) appears to be
the same, the process used to achieve that result can have longer-term implications.
Cooperation may reduce costs through joint improvement, whereas heavy-handed
cost pressure may force a supplier to cut corners, resulting in poor quality.
</p>
<p>Cost Changes
A cost-change measure compares the actual cost of an item or family of items
</p>
<p>over a period of time. A cost change is the increase or decrease in cost resulting from
a change in purchasing strategy or practice brought about by an individual or a
group.
</p>
<p>The primary measure of concern to companies is cost reduction achieved, which
is calculated by taking (New price &minus; Prior price) &times; Estimated volume. For example, if
the new price was $9/unit and the prior price was $10/unit with an estimated volume
of 10,000 units for the next budget period, there would be a projected cost reduction
of $10,000. Actual usage would determine the final cost reduction achieved.
</p>
<p>Cost Avoidance
Cost avoidance represents the difference between a price paid and a potentially
</p>
<p>higher price (which might have occurred if purchasing had not obtained the lower
price through a specific effort or action). For example, assume that purchasing paid
$5.00 per unit for an item in the past, but the supplier has now quoted a price of
$5.50 per unit. If the buyer negotiates a price of $5.25 per unit, then he or she has
achieved a cost avoidance of $0.25 per unit, even though the price was still $0.25
higher than the prior price. Unfortunately, finance often argues that cost-avoidance
savings rarely show up on a firm&rsquo;s profit line.
</p>
<p>Cost-change and cost-avoidance measures differ significantly. Cost change rep-
resents an actual change from a prior-period price, whereas cost avoidance refers to
the amount that would have been paid minus the amount actually paid. Purchasing
departments that require tangible cost improvement should focus more on the cost-

<p>change approach. This represents actual changes that can impact a firm&rsquo;s overall
profitability.
</p>
<p>Cost-avoidance figures almost always require manual calculation and are sometimes
subject to exaggeration. As a result, some observers have described cost-avoidance mea-
sures and figures as &ldquo;soft,&rdquo; &ldquo;funny money,&rdquo; and &ldquo;easy to manipulate.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Revenue Measures
Revenue measures demonstrate the impact of purchasing and supply strategies
</p>
<p>and actions on revenues of the firm. For example, purchasing and supply may un-
cover new supplier technologies before others in the industry do and gain exclusive ac-
cess, resulting in new product applications with favorable pricing and volume growth.
</p>
<p>In addition, firms have achieved revenue growth due to royalty agreements negoti-
ated with suppliers that have sold jointly developed technologies to other customers.
Revenue from royalty generated from licensing patents and other technologies may
be measured and reported.
</p>
<p>Meeting new-product introduction dates with perfect supplier performance, en-
abling a first-to-market position with premium pricing, was also linked to revenue
growth. Perfect-launch revenue is critical at many firms and is influenced by supplier
performance.
</p>
<p>Revenue measures for purchasing and supply are important because they link pur-
chasing and supply strategies to the revenue elements of economic value-add. How-
ever, relatively few revenue measures are in use. Apparently, firms have not fully
recognized the contribution to revenue generation that purchasing and supply can
make. This is the case for direct goods and even more true on the indirect side,
where the linkage of purchasing and supply strategy to revenues is less obvious or, per-
haps, nonexistent.
</p>
<p>Revenue Measure Examples
&bull; Royalty revenues generated from supplier- or buyer-developed technology
and patents initiated by purchasing or sourcing
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier contribution as a reason for new business, e.g., new business devel-
opment, unique technology found by purchasing, flexibility in shifting out-
put product or service mix to meet higher profit or revenue, generating
customer demand
</p>
<p>&bull; Return on licensing technology driven by purchasing or sourcing
</p>
<p>&bull; Number of patents that have led to royalties
</p>
<p>&bull; Number of invention disclosure forms filed
</p>
<p>&bull; Number of patents granted
</p>
<p>&bull; Value of free samples from suppliers
</p>
<p>Quality Measures
</p>
<p>Parts per Million
This measure expresses a maximum number (in absolute or percentage terms) of
</p>
<p>level of defects allowable for any particular product, assembly, or service. It may be ex-
pressed by using one of the following specific definitions or could be the mean time

<p>between failures for a plant or equipment item. When applied to products, compo-
nents, assemblies, or systems, the traditional metric has been parts per million failing
to conform to specification. As quality control has improved and the ability to manu-
facture to tighter tolerances has increased, this metric may also be tightened. In deter-
mining the PPM result, there is a need to measure (by factual inspection, testing, or
statistically reliable sampling) the incidence of defective or nonconforming parts. The
measure demands a reference point such as production, receipt, incoming inspection,
or shipment. In addition, quality measures are also being developed and being used
for services.
</p>
<p>Customer Defects per Supplier
This is a measure of the number of defects from individual suppliers to indicate
</p>
<p>comparative quality performance among competing suppliers. It is also used as an ab-
solute target for suppliers in total to attain and surpass, often as part of an assess-
ment, certification, and reward approach. Measurement is calculated by inspecting or
sampling the number of acceptable components, assemblies, or systems delivered as a
proportion of the total number of those parts delivered by that supplier.
</p>
<p>It is possible to aggregate this measure across all the different items supplied by
any one supplier to arrive at an average number of defects for that supplier. How-
ever, the strategic criticality of items is not taken into account.
</p>
<p>Field Failure Rates by Purchase Item and by Supplier
This measures the incidence of failures of components, assemblies, and systems or
</p>
<p>services when actually incorporated into the final product or service and supplied to ex-
ternal customers. As a measure, it indicates failures after sale, and organizations will
tend to aim for a zero incidence of such failures. However, in some industries (e.g.,
equipment rental) this measure becomes a key measure of customer satisfaction.
</p>
<p>The metric is calculated by developing a ratio of failures against total installed pop-
ulation. It is used to monitor product performance after sale, manage after-sales sup-
port costs, and provide input to supplier improvement, product design improvement,
and replacement design by tracking failure rates and their root causes.
</p>
<p>Time/Delivery/Responsiveness Measures
</p>
<p>Time-to-Market Targets, New Products/Services
This measure is the amount of time (in weeks or months) from concept to first
</p>
<p>shipment or provision of a product or service to the external customer. The objective
is continuous reduction so as to reduce the amount of time it takes to achieve break-
even of investment and also to be first to market with the product or service.
</p>
<p>On-Time Delivery/Responsiveness
These measures indicate the degree to which suppliers are able to meet customer
</p>
<p>schedule requirements. Key elements for such measures include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Due dates, scheduled or promised
</p>
<p>&bull; Delivery windows
</p>
<p>&bull; Acceptable early or late arrivals to due dates (e.g., minus two days or no
days late)

<p>Chapter 19 Performance Measurement and Evaluation 717</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The metrics are typically calculated as the percentage of shipments, services, or in-
dividual items on time or late (occasionally early). These measures can be applied in
service or manufacturing businesses. Supplier and procurement performance can be
measured through indices based on the above measures. These metrics can be further
organized by commodity or purchase family. Percentages are calculated by company
total on-time to total deliveries, and then further reported by purchase family and
supplier.
</p>
<p>Achieving New-Product Introduction Ramp-Up Schedules and
Introduction Dates
</p>
<p>These measures indicate whether procurement and supply chain management and
strategic processes and suppliers are achieving necessary available volume goals at
milestones and at market introduction dates for the product or service.
</p>
<p>Cycle Time Reductions: Order Entry, Manufacturing/Operations,
Distribution, and Logistics
</p>
<p>These measures should identify total cycle time and its key components. Measures
focus on reduction through elimination of delays and delivering continuous improve-
ment to target times. Examples include supplier manufacturing cycle times, order en-
try, internal operations, transportation, and so forth.
</p>
<p>Responsiveness to Schedule Changes, Mix Changes, and Design
or Service Changes
</p>
<p>These measures indicate how quickly suppliers can respond to demand or use
changes, for example, the ability to adjust schedule by 50% within two weeks of sched-
uled delivery. Another measure could be time to achieve design changes to allowable
targets. These measures recognize the need for flexibility.
</p>
<p>Technology or Innovation Measures
</p>
<p>First Insight/Production Outputs of New Supplier Technology
This measure would typically link to a contractual agreement whereby, for new
</p>
<p>technologies, your firm may get insight, some period of time before new technology
developments are shared with other organizations. This may be an important focus
in dealings with selected key technology suppliers to your firm. A specific metric can
be the number of such agreements with key suppliers for critical technologies. Any tar-
get would be firm specific. A potential drawback with this measure is that no account
is taken of the success or failure arising from such technology insights.
</p>
<p>Standardization and Use of Industry Standards
These measures focus on achieving standardization of components, systems, and
</p>
<p>services and application of currently used purchased items or the use of industry-
standard versus -unique items. Specific measures include reduction of different items
used, percentage of new products or services made up of currently purchased items,
and number of industry-unique items utilized in a new product or service. Your firm
would then establish these and similar measures for product- or service-specific goals.

<p>Physical Environment and Safety Measures
Companies are tracking the achievement of environmental and safety goals and
</p>
<p>costs associated with compliance, both voluntary compliance and where legislation en-
forces compliance. The objective is to drive performance improvement to achieve
self-imposed or regulatory goals.
</p>
<p>Asset and Integrated Supply Chain
Management Measures
</p>
<p>The measurement of inventory as an asset for a single enterprise may include a
number of typical unit or aggregate inventory measures such as the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Dollar value of inventory investment (following appropriate accounting
rules)
</p>
<p>&bull; Inventory turnover
</p>
<p>&bull; Days/weeks/months of supply of inventory
</p>
<p>The objective is to reduce inventory cost by increasing the velocity of throughput
or reducing inventory carrying cost. A unique use of this measure is its application
across inventory throughout various stages within a firm&rsquo;s supply chain and, more im-
portantly, across firms in the aggregate supply chain (external to your firm) with speci-
fied future targets.
</p>
<p>In addition, it is common to have additional measures that track different aspects
of a firm&rsquo;s inventory investment. Examples include percentage of active versus in-
active part numbers, total number of part numbers, working capital savings, and in-
ventory investment by type of purchased item (for example, production items,
maintenance items, and packaging materials).
</p>
<p>It is also common to have measures that track the speed or velocity of inventory
as it moves through different elements of the supply chain. This includes raw mate-
rial, work-in-process, and finished-goods inventory turns. The amount of inventory
maintained as safety stock is also a common measure. The accuracy of computer rec-
ords that are part of the inventory location system is also closely tracked.
</p>
<p>Transportation Cost Reduction
Transportation measures include tracking actual transportation costs against some
</p>
<p>pre-established objective, demurrage and detention costs, and premium transporta-
tion. Transportation carrier quality, delivery performance levels, and transportation
lead time can also be measured.
</p>
<p>Cost-reduction measures focus on the total transportation costs incurred per plan-
ning period to conduct business and those premium transportation costs incurred
where expediting requires a nonstandard transportation method to meet internal or
external requirements, for example, using air shipments when trucking is the pre-
ferred shipping mode.
</p>
<p>Transportation costs can be measured in total dollars and as a percentage of cost
of goods sold or sales revenue. Premium transportation can be measured in dollars
or percentage of overall transportation costs. These costs can be measured inbound,
intracompany, and outbound. S

<p>Customer Orders
These measures evaluate how well an organization is satisfying its commitment to
</p>
<p>downstream customers. Various measures include the percentage of on-time delivery,
total time from customer order to customer delivery, returned orders, and warranty
claims. Although we have focused primarily on purchasing and upstream supply
chain activities, purchasing and materials planners are increasingly responsible for
managing inventory from a total supply chain perspective. This may also include
downstream activities.
</p>
<p>E-Transactions (Number and Percentage of Suppliers/Dollars/Orders)
These measures show some degree of cross-enterprise linkage. The magnitude of
</p>
<p>use of electronic data interchange or web-based systems that link buyers and suppli-
ers can, for example, be measured by the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Absolute number of suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Percentage of suppliers
</p>
<p>&bull; Dollar value and percentage of orders
</p>
<p>&bull; Percentage of advance shipping notices
</p>
<p>&bull; Electronic funds transfer
</p>
<p>&bull; Meeting customer requirements
</p>
<p>&bull; Inventory throughout the supply chain
</p>
<p>&bull; Other
</p>
<p>Pull Systems/Shared Schedules/Supplier Managed Inventory (SMI)
These measures establish the number (or percentage) of suppliers that are sharing
</p>
<p>schedules and operating in a pull system environment. They may also measure percen-
tages of suppliers that are sharing schedules against those that should be. SMI mea-
sures establish the number of suppliers and magnitude of inventory being managed
by suppliers for which they have financial responsibility.
</p>
<p>Administration and Efficiency Measures
Management uses administration and efficiency measures to plan purchasing&rsquo;s an-
</p>
<p>nual administrative budget and to help control administrative expenses during a bud-
get period. Budgeted expense items commonly include salaries, travel and living
expenses, training expenses, office supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses. Sala-
ries traditionally take the largest share of the purchasing administrative budget. The
two most common methods to establish the purchasing administrative budget are the
current budget plus adjustment and the use of control ratios.
</p>
<p>Current Budget Plus Adjustment
The most common method of establishing a budget uses the current administra-
</p>
<p>tive budget as a starting point. Management then adjusts the budget for the next pe-
riod (usually the next fiscal year) upward or downward depending on expected
business conditions or other departmental requirements. Budget adjustments reflect
management&rsquo;s view about projected purchasing workload and a firm&rsquo;s profitability.
Decreasing workload or profits can result in a budget reduction. Conversely, increas-
ing workload or profits may justify a budget increase.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Control Ratios
With the control ratio approach, the purchasing administrative budget is a percent-
</p>
<p>age of another measure that reflects purchasing&rsquo;s workload. Planned dollar expendi-
ture for direct material is often the selected workload measure.
</p>
<p>The historical control ratio as well as negotiation between purchasing and higher
management often determines the control ratio percentage used during calculation of
the administrative budget. A projection of direct material purchase requirements for
the next period then affects the administrative budget. Purchasing workload is as-
sumed to be proportional to planned dollar expenditures for direct material. The pur-
chasing administrative budget becomes the following:
</p>
<p>Purchasing Budget &frac14; Estimated Expenditures for Direct Materials
� Control Ratio
</p>
<p>Purchasing managers use the total budget figure to allocate resources among different
departmental uses. Management must determine how many buyers are required, the
size of the clerical support staff, and other budget-related issues.
</p>
<p>Other Approaches
Current budget plus adjustment and control ratios are not the only methods used
</p>
<p>to arrive at a purchasing administrative budget or efficiency. Purchasing workload
such as purchase orders processed, line items processed, and headcount may also be
used to measure efficiency. Again, we must warn against emphasizing purchasing effi-
ciency over purchasing effectiveness as a strict indicator of performance.

</p>
<p>The Perfect Order at
Procter and Gamble
</p>
<p>The perfect order represents the ability of the supply chain to provide 100% availabil-
ity in a timely, error-free manner. Procter and Gamble (P&amp;G), a manufacturer and distributor
of consumer products, defines the perfect order metric as on time to the buyer&rsquo;s requested de-
livery date, shipped complete, invoiced correctly, and not damaged in transit. In 1992, P&amp;G
began to measure its perfect orders. Initially, managers were shocked to discover that the
number of perfect orders was only around 75%. Since that time, substantial improvements
have been made. In 1995, 82% of orders were perfect; and by 1998, 88% were perfect. This
has been achieved through continuous replenishment, having customer service represen-
tatives work closely with major customers, and improved information systems. Procter and
Gamble estimates that every imperfect order costs approximately $200 as a result of redeliv-
ery, lost revenue, damage, warehouse and shipping costs, deductions, and backorders. P&amp;G
knows that continuous supply chain improvement requires measuring what is really impor-
tant to the customer. And to the customer, the perfect order is important.

<p>Governmental and Social Measures
</p>
<p>Minority, Women, and Small Business Enterprise Objectives
In the United States there are social, state, and federal requirements that public
</p>
<p>and private organizations place a percentage of their business with minority- and
women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs). These expenditures are regularly tar-
geted at specific performance levels, tracked, and reported; they are used to drive pur-
chasing strategy. Small-business purchases may also be included. Specific measures
may include the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Percentage of spend (the proportion of purchase spend from MWBE suppli-
ers as a percentage of total annual purchase spend), calculated as follows:
</p>
<p>Annual Purchase &eth;$&THORN; from MWBE Suppliers
Total Annual External Purchases &eth;$&THORN; &frac14; %
</p>
<p>&bull; Number of suppliers in each MWBE category
</p>
<p>&bull; Growth of MWBE spend
</p>
<p>Internal Customer Satisfaction Measures
Companies are also applying measures that indicate the degree of satisfaction with
</p>
<p>purchasing&rsquo;s value-add contribution. This is typically done by surveying internal cus-
tomers and asking them to indicate their satisfaction with purchasing by responding
to a series of check-off and open-ended questions. Supplier satisfaction surveys and
measures are also used.
</p>
<p>Supplier Performance Measures
Supplier performance measurement is an area in which many firms have made
</p>
<p>great progress. Supplier scorecards frequently contain many of the measures dis-
cussed above. Purchasers generally track supplier quality, cost, and delivery along
with other performance areas. Furthermore, firms are beginning to quantify the cost
associated with supplier nonperformance. The resulting cost figure represents the to-
tal cost of doing business with a supplier. Supplier total-cost measures allow direct
comparisons between suppliers.
</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard developed a supplier performance evaluation model that evalu-
ates supplier performance (and the teams that manage those suppliers) in the areas
of T (technology contribution), Q (quality), R (supplier responsiveness), D (delivery
performance), C (cost), and E (environmental performance). The FedEx supplier
scorecard featured in Chapter 9 provides additional details about supplier perfor-
mance measurement systems. These supplier scorecards are increasingly important in
selecting, motivating, and developing suppliers.
</p>
<p>Strategic Performance Measures
Purchasing requires measures that reflect its ability to support overall corporate
</p>
<p>and functional goals, which means a reduced emphasis on pure efficiency measures
(e.g., the cost to issue a purchase order or current workload status) and greater empha-
sis on effectiveness measures (those that reflect purchasing&rsquo;s strategic contribution).
Examples of the latter include tracking early supplier involvement in product design,
performance gains resulting from direct supplier development efforts, and supplier-

<p>provided improvement suggestions. Within most industries, purchasing must shift
from measuring itself as an administrative support function to measuring how well it
provides strategic value.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 19.3 provides examples of key strategic purchasing measures. Notice that
these measures are a combination of activity- and results-oriented measures. Empha-
sis shifts from strict indicators of personnel performance or efficiency to how well
the purchasing function supports strategic supply-base management goals and objec-
tives. To shift from an operational to a strategic perspective, the purchasing measure-
ment and evaluation system must also shift.
</p>
<p>The performance indicators in Exhibit 19.3 are more strategically and externally fo-
cused than traditional performance indicators. They are also specified in terms of
broader purchasing goals rather than specific activity. For example, a buyer may be re-
sponsible for a performance objective stating that 75% of the buyer&rsquo;s suppliers will be
quality certified by the third quarter of 2007. This differs from a measure that states
a buyer must process 10 requests for quotation per day on average.

<p>Developing a Performance Measurement
and Evaluation System
</p>
<p>The development of a measurement and evaluation system requires the leadership,
support, and commitment of executive management, who must commit the financial
resources necessary for system development. Management must also require all pur-
chasing locations to use the same system structure, which can reduce duplication of ef-
fort and save development and training costs. This does not mean that each location
must use the same performance objectives or performance criteria. It only means
that the system&rsquo;s basic design should be similar. Executive management support also
sends a message about the seriousness of tracking and improving performance.
</p>
<p>Development of an effective measurement and evaluation system follows a general
sequence of activities. These include determining which performance categories to
measure, developing specific performance measures, establishing performance stan-
dards for each measure, finalizing system details, and implementing and reviewing
the system and each performance measure. Exhibit 19.4 presents an overview of the
development of a purchasing and supply chain performance measurement system.
</p>
<p>Determine Which Performance Categories to Measure
A previous section discussed various performance measurement categories. The
</p>
<p>first step of the development process requires identifying which measurement catego-
ries to emphasize. Also, a firm can weight its performance measures and categories
differently.
</p>
<p>Management does not concern itself with specific performance measures during
this phase of system development. The selected performance categories must relate
broadly to organizational and purchasing and supply chain goals and objectives.
</p>
<p>Selecting the performance measure categories is a critical step prior to developing
specific performance measures.
</p>
<p>Develop Specific Performance Measures
Developing specific performance measures begins once management identifies the
</p>
<p>measurement categories it will emphasize. Certain features characterize successful pur-
chasing and supply chain performance measures.
</p>
<p>Objectivity
Each measure should be as objective as possible. The measurement system should
</p>
<p>rely on quantitative data instead of qualitative feelings and assessments. Subjective
evaluation can create disagreement between the rater and the individual or group re-
sponsible for the performance objective.
</p>
<p>Clarity
Personnel must understand a performance measure&rsquo;s requirements in order to di-
</p>
<p>rect performance toward the desired outcome and minimize misunderstandings. All
parties must be clear about what each performance measure means, agree on theS

<p>performance objectives associated with the measure, and understand what it takes to
accomplish the measure. Well-understood measures are straightforward and unam-
biguous.
</p>
<p>Use of Accurate and Available Data
Well-defined measures use data that are available and accurate. If a measure re-
</p>
<p>quires data that are difficult to generate or unreliable, the probability of using the mea-
sure on a consistent basis declines. The cost of generating and collecting the required
data should not outweigh the potential benefit of using the performance measure.
</p>
<p>Creativity
A common misconception is that a performance evaluation system should mea-
</p>
<p>sure every possible activity. When this occurs, the measures can stifle individual crea-
tivity. The measures control behavior so tightly that the system eliminates room for
personal initiative. A successful system measures only what is important while still
promoting individual initiative and creativity, which may mean focusing on 5 or 6 im-
portant, clearly defined measures instead of 25 vague measures.

<p>Directly Related to Organizational Objectives
Exhibit 19.5 illustrates how corporate goals and objectives influence purchasing
</p>
<p>goals and objectives. Other functional objectives also can influence purchasing. For ex-
ample, manufacturing&rsquo;s goals can have a direct impact on purchasing because purchas-
ing supports the manufacturing process. To meet its goals and objectives, purchasing
executives develop strategies and action plans. Finally, management develops measures
that evaluate the output or performance from the activities required to accomplish
purchasing&rsquo;s strategies and plans. The measures serve as indicators of purchasing&rsquo;s
progress.
</p>
<p>Joint Participation
Joint participation means that the personnel responsible for each measure partici-
</p>
<p>pate in developing the measure or establishing the measure&rsquo;s performance objective.
Joint participation can go a long way toward getting the support of the personnel re-
sponsible for achieving the measure.
</p>
<p>Dynamic over Time
A dynamic system is one that management reviews periodically, to determine
</p>
<p>whether existing measures still support purchasing&rsquo;s goals and objectives, if there is a
need for new measures, or if performance standards or objectives require updating.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Nonmanipulable
A nonmanipulable measure is one that personnel cannot inappropriately influence
</p>
<p>the results of (i.e., the measure is cheat-proof). Ideally, the individual(s) responsible
for the measure should not be responsible for supplying the data to the reporting sys-
tem. This becomes an issue of accountability and integrity. The measure&rsquo;s output
should be a true reflection of actual activity or performance results. Systems receiving
their input from automated or computerized systems are generally less susceptible to
data manipulation.
</p>
<p>Establish Performance Objectives for Each Measure
Establishing an objective for each performance measure is critical. Objectives quan-
</p>
<p>tify the desired performance target or goal. Management must not specify objectives
that are too easy. The too-easy objective can become an accepted performance stan-
dard within a department.
</p>
<p>Performance standards or objectives must be realistic, which means the measure
should be challenging yet achievable through a solid effort. An objective should not
be so easy that it requires minimal effort. It should not be so difficult that it dis-
courages personnel from even attempting to achieve the objective. The objective
must also reflect the realities of a firm&rsquo;s competitive environment. An objective that
is challenging internally yet does not reflect the competitive environment is not part
of a well-defined measure.
</p>
<p>Firms commonly use three methods when establishing performance measure objec-
tives: (1) historical data, (2) internal comparisons, and (3) external analysis.
</p>
<p>Historical Data
This method uses past data about an activity as the basis for establishing a formal
</p>
<p>performance objective. Historical performance is often modified with a performance
improvement factor to arrive at a current objective. Purchasing and supply chain man-
agers often use the historical approach with efficiency-related measures.
</p>
<p>Relying on historical data can create some problems. The possibility exists that
past performance was less than optimal. By establishing an objective based on subopti-
mal performance, even with an improvement factor, a firm risks continuing subopti-
mal performance. Also, historical data provide no insight about the performance
capabilities of competitors or other leading firms. In addition, the firm&rsquo;s goals, strate-
gies, and financial objectives will drive purchasing and supply goals. Purchasing
cannot be a value contributor without contributing to firm success through goal
achievement.
</p>
<p>Internal Comparisons
A firm can perform internal comparisons between departments or business units.
</p>
<p>The best internal performance level can become the basis for a companywide perfor-
mance objective. Firms with multiple business units often compare and rank perfor-
mance internally across different performance categories.
</p>
<p>This approach, which offers some advantages over the historical approach, also
has disadvantages. A firm that stresses comparisons between internal units can lose
sight of its external competition. Unhealthy rivalry can also develop between internal

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>business units or departments. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the best-
performing internal unit matches the best-performing unit of a direct competitor.
</p>
<p>External Analysis
This approach requires examination of the practices and performance objectives
</p>
<p>of competitors or other leading firms. The advantage of this approach is that it re-
quires an external assessment at very specific levels of detail. A later section dis-
cusses benchmarking as a competitive-analysis approach for establishing performance
objectives.
</p>
<p>Finalize System Details
The next phase of implementation requires management to consider issues such
</p>
<p>as the frequency of performance reporting, the education and training of system
users, and the final determination of how to use system output.
</p>
<p>Performance-Reporting Frequency
A sound measurement and evaluation system provides regular reporting of perfor-
</p>
<p>mance results. The actual reporting frequency can differ from measure to measure.
Management must determine what frequency supports the most effective use of each
measure. A measure that tracks the status of inbound transportation shipments, for
example, must be available on a frequent (daily or real-time) basis. A summary mea-
sure evaluating overall supplier performance may require only weekly or monthly
reporting.
</p>
<p>Education and Training
A firm must train its personnel and suppliers to use the performance measure-
</p>
<p>ment and evaluation system. Each participant must understand his or her account-
ability and responsibility under the system and how to use the system&rsquo;s output to
improve performance. The measurement and evaluation system is a tool, and like
all tools, it requires proper education and training in its use.
</p>
<p>Using System Output
Managers use the output of a performance measurement and evaluation system in
</p>
<p>a number of ways. Some managers rely on the output to directly evaluate the perfor-
mance of purchasing personnel or suppliers. Managers may use the system to track
the effectiveness of individual buyers. System output may also identify better-perform-
ing suppliers that deserve future purchase contracts.
</p>
<p>Managers must give careful thought to how best to use system output.
</p>
<p>Implement and Review System Performance
and Measures
</p>
<p>All systems have an implementation phase, which may include pilot or trial runs
to make sure the system performs as planned. The measurement and evaluation sys-
tem, along with each performance measure, must be subject to periodic review. Hav-
ing a system that contains obsolete or inappropriate measures can be more damaging
than having no formal system at all.

<p>Performance Benchmarking: Comparing
Against the Best
</p>
<p>An ongoing approach for establishing performance standards, processes, measure-
ments, and objectives is benchmarking, a process that is not exclusively a purchasing
or supply chain practice or approach per se. Rather, it is an approach used by corpo-
rate- and functional-level executives and managers. Benchmarking has definite appli-
cations, however, when establishing purchasing and supply chain management
performance objectives and action plans. Before discussing specific benchmarking ap-
plications, we must first gain an understanding of the benchmarking process.
</p>
<p>Benchmarking Overview
Benchmarking is the continuous measuring of products, services, processes, activi-
</p>
<p>ties, and practices against a firm&rsquo;s best competitors or those companies recognized as
industry or functional leaders.3 Formally, the benchmarking process or activity re-
quires measuring performance against that of best-in-class companies, determining
how the best-in-class achieve their performance levels, and using that information as
the basis for establishing a company&rsquo;s performance targets, strategies, and action
plans.4
</p>
<p>Benchmarking does not always involve comparisons against competitors. Firms of-
ten rely on comparisons with noncompetitors as a source of information, especially
when benchmarking a process or functional activity common to firms across differ-
ent industries (for example, supply chain management). It is usually easier to obtain
benchmarking data and information from a cooperative noncompetitor.
</p>
<p>Benchmarking is necessary for firms that are not industry leaders. Unfortunately,
many U.S. firms did not recognize the need for performance benchmarking until af-
ter foreign competitors captured worldwide market share. Industry leaders should
also practice performance benchmarking on a regular basis. A firm may not retain
market leadership if it is unaware of the actions and capabilities of its competitors.
</p>
<p>Types of Benchmarking
There are three basic types of performance benchmarking.5 The first type is strate-
</p>
<p>gic benchmarking, which involves a comparison of one firm&rsquo;s market strategies against
those of another. Strategic benchmarking usually involves comparisons against lead-
ing competitors, allowing a firm to gain an in-depth understanding of their market
strategies.6 With this knowledge, a firm can develop strategies and plans to counter
or pre-empt the competition.
</p>
<p>The second type of benchmarking is operational benchmarking, a process that the
purchasing function follows when it performs benchmarking comparisons. Opera-
tional benchmarking focuses on different aspects of functional activity and identifies
methods to achieve best-in-class performance. Selecting the function and the activi-
ties within that function to benchmark are critical to the success of operational bench-
marking. Firms should benchmark functional activities that provide the greatest
return over time.
</p>
<p>The third type of benchmarking is support-activity benchmarking. During this pro-
cess, support functions within an organization demonstrate their cost-effectiveness
against external providers of the same support service or activity. Firms are

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>increasingly using support-activity benchmarking as a way of controlling internal
overhead and rising costs.
</p>
<p>Benchmarking Benefits
There are a number of ways that a company hopes to benefit from actively pursu-
</p>
<p>ing performance benchmarking.7 The benchmarking process helps identify the best
business or functional practices to include in a firm&rsquo;s business plans, which can lead
directly to performance improvement. Benchmarking can also break down a reluc-
tance to change. Managers begin to see what it takes to maintain corporate or func-
tional leadership by viewing the outside world. Benchmarking can also serve as a
source of market intelligence. For example, competitive benchmarking may uncover
a previously unrecognized technological breakthrough. Finally, valuable professional
contacts between firms can result from the benchmarking process.
</p>
<p>Benchmarking Critical Success Factors
Certain factors are critical to benchmarking success. Performance benchmarking
</p>
<p>must become an accepted process within a firm or function and not simply another
fashionable program or fad. Personnel must view performance benchmarking as a per-
manent part of a system that establishes goals, objectives, and competitive strategies.
Executive management support for the process is critical.
</p>
<p>A firm must also be willing to commit the necessary legwork to data gathering. A
firm must identify which company is the best-in-class for an activity, identify why
that company is best, and quantify the benchmarked performance measure. The suc-
cess of the benchmarking process depends on detailed and accurate benchmarked
data and information that becomes part of a firm&rsquo;s action plans and performance
objectives.
</p>
<p>Managers must view benchmarking as a way to learn from outside companies
and improve internal operations on a continuous basis.8 Some individuals resist the
benchmarking process because of a reluctance to recognize the value of a competi-
tor&rsquo;s way of doing business&mdash;the &ldquo;not invented here&rdquo; syndrome. One way around this
syndrome is to benchmark a noncompetitor&rsquo;s activities and performance wherever
possible. Obviously, strategic benchmarking requires comparisons against direct com-
petitors. For functional activities, however, a firm can study the performance and
methods of noncompetitors.
</p>
<p>Information and Data Sources
A solid source of benchmarking data includes trade journals, other business li-
</p>
<p>brary resources, and the World Wide Web. Trade journals and other industry publica-
tions often feature firms that have distinguished themselves in some way. If this is
not adequate, a firm can contact a benchmark target directly to request further
information.
</p>
<p>Industrywide conferences and professional seminars are also good sources of infor-
mation, particularly at a functional level. These meetings often serve as a forum for
the exchange of ideas about different topics. Leading firms often make presentations
at industry trade meetings. These meetings can provide clues about which firms are
the most highly regarded in a particular business area or practice.

<p>Suppliers are another source of information. Purchasers can ask suppliers to iden-
tify the firms they believe are the best for each benchmark performance area. A firm
can also rely on a professional consultant or other industry experts to identify bench-
marking candidates.
</p>
<p>An ongoing major purchasing benchmarking initiative conducted by CAPS Re-
search (jointly sponsored by the Institute of Supply Management and W. P. Carey
School of Business at Arizona State University) is another important source of
information.
</p>
<p>This effort includes specific industry-by-industry performance benchmarks and an
ongoing study of leading-edge supply strategies. The CAPS Strategic Sourcing and Ex-
cellence Model provides the framework for the supply strategy and practice research.
Data are collected via focus group visioning sessions, field research, and Internet-
based surveys and assessments. Research findings about industry benchmarks and cur-
rent and future supply chain strategies and practices are available at Knowledge Cen-
tral, an online database sponsored by CAPS Research (http://www.capsresearch.org).
</p>
<p>The Benchmarking Process
Robert Camp noted that there are five distinct steps or phases before a firm fully re-
</p>
<p>ceives the benefits of the performance benchmarking process.9 Exhibit 19.6 on p. 732
graphically presents these five phases.
</p>
<p>Planning
During this initial phase of the benchmarking process, a firm addresses issues
</p>
<p>such as which products or functions to benchmark, which companies to select as
benchmarking targets (competitors, noncompetitors, or both), and how to identify
data and information sources. Benchmarking plans should focus on process and meth-
ods rather than simply on quantitative performance results. The process and meth-
ods cause the quantitative end results.
</p>
<p>Analysis
Data and information collection and analysis occur during the second phase. A
</p>
<p>firm must determine how and why the benchmarked firm is better. A variety of ques-
tions should be asked:
</p>
<p>&bull; In what product or functional areas is the benchmarked company better?
</p>
<p>&bull; Why is the benchmarked company better?
</p>
<p>&bull; How large is the gap between the benchmarked company and our company?
</p>
<p>&bull; Can we include the benchmarked company&rsquo;s best practices directly in our
operating plans?
</p>
<p>&bull; Can we project future performance levels and rates of change?
</p>
<p>This phase is critical because it requires management to interpret and understand the
benchmarked company&rsquo;s processes, methods, and activities.
</p>
<p>Integration
Integration is the process of communicating and gaining acceptance of the bench-
</p>
<p>marking findings throughout an organization. During this phase, management begins to
establish operational targets and functional goals based on the benchmarking findings.

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Action
The action phase requires translating the benchmark findings into detailed action
</p>
<p>plans. Critical items during this phase include having personnel directly responsible
for carrying out the plans involved with formulation of the plans, developing a sched-
ule for updating plans and objectives over time, and developing a reporting system to
communicate progress toward benchmarking goals.
</p>
<p>Maturity
A firm reaches maturity when benchmarking becomes an accepted process for es-
</p>
<p>tablishing performance plans and objectives. Another indicator of benchmarking ma-
turity occurs when a firm realizes continuous performance improvement as a direct
result of performance benchmarking.
</p>
<p>A formal process, such as benchmarking, is essential for establishing performance
targets and action plans that are externally focused. Without external comparisons,

<p>most organizations run the risk of losing sight of what defines best practices or what
the competition is doing. Purchasing and supply chain managers must endorse this
practice when attempting to establish plans, measures, and objectives that represent
best-in-class performance.
</p>
<p>Balanced Scorecard for Purchasing and Supply
The balanced scorecard was first presented by Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton
</p>
<p>in 1992. The original premise was that a total reliance on financial measures was leading
organizations to make poor decisions. Kaplan and Norton argued that firms must go be-
yond financial measures, which are lagging indicators, and utilize measures that are lead-
ing indicators of performance.
</p>
<p>They further suggested that the most appropriate measures that would cause orga-
nizations to do the right things would be those metrics that measure the strategy of
the firm, its functional activities, and processes.
</p>
<p>According to Kaplan and Norton, the balanced scorecard included four key linked
performance measurement areas:
</p>
<p>1. How do customers see us? (customer satisfaction perspective)
</p>
<p>2. What must we excel at? (operational excellence perspective)
</p>
<p>3. Can we continue to improve and create value? (innovation perspective)
</p>
<p>4. How do we look to shareholders? (financial perspective)
</p>
<p>In addition, Kaplan and Norton stressed that measurement itself is not the objective.
Measurement and specific metrics provide clarity to general statements and a strat-
egy focus around which to provide performance recognition and rewards.
</p>
<p>The balanced scorecard and its related ideas have been adapted by numerous com-
panies and applied to purchasing and supply.
</p>
<p>Exhibit 19.7 on p. 734 is one example of a balanced scorecard for purchasing and
supply. Included are measures related to the following questions:
</p>
<p>1. How do we look to shareholders? (financial perspective)
</p>
<p>2. How do our customers see us? (internal and external perspectives)
</p>
<p>3. What must we excel at? (operational excellence perspective)
</p>
<p>4. What do we need to do to improve? (innovation perspective)
</p>
<p>Based on the company&rsquo;s purchasing and supply strategies, the balanced scorecard
would then be connected to a specific set of appropriate performance measurements.
The result will be a scorecard by department or people with specific key performance
indicators.
</p>
<p>A Summary of Purchasing Measurement and
Evaluation Characteristics
</p>
<p>A review of purchasing and supply chain performance and measurement systems
supports a number of conclusions. These fall into two categories: system character-
istics and human resource characteristics.

</p>
<p>Chapter 19 Performance Measurement and Evaluation 733</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>System Characteristics
1. Measurement is not free. An evaluation system must compare the costs associ-
</p>
<p>ated with measurement against the benefits. Furthermore, increased measure-
ment does not necessarily mean improved performance. The amount and
type of measurement should be enough to achieve the intended result but not
cause negative or dysfunctional behavior.
</p>
<p>2. Not all aspects of performance lend themselves to quantitative measurement.
Negotiating skill and obtaining supplier cooperation are two examples of per-
formance categories that are difficult to quantify.
</p>
<p>3. Purchasing and supply chain managers are better served by a few precisely
defined and thoroughly understood measures than by many poorly defined
measures.
</p>
<p>4. An effective measurement system requires a database that provides consistent
and reliable data. All personnel must have access to the same data when calcu-
lating and reporting purchasing performance indicators.
</p>
<p>5. Periodic review of the purchasing and supply chain measurement system should
occur to eliminate unimportant or unnecessary performance measures, add new
measures as required, and re-evaluate performance measure objectives or targets.

<p>6. There is no best way to measure performance. Performance measures differ
from firm to firm and industry to industry. No established industry purchas-
ing performance standards have yet emerged. However, the movement toward
performance benchmarking does support the development of performance in-
dicators common to more than one firm.
</p>
<p>7. Measurement-reporting requirements and content vary by position and level
within the organization. Careful planning helps guarantee effective use of the
system at each organizational level.
</p>
<p>8. A single, overall productivity measure representing purchasing and supply
chain performance is not feasible.
</p>
<p>9. Many industries need to shift from operational measures focusing on activity
to strategic measures assessing a desired end result (for example, increased par-
ticipation by suppliers during new-product development).
</p>
<p>10. The strategies and plans used to produce a performance measure&rsquo;s result are
probably more important than the end performance result itself.
</p>
<p>11. A balanced scorecard approach is an effective method of measurement and
evaluation for purchasing and supply.
</p>
<p>Human Resource Characteristics
1. A measurement and evaluation system is not a substitute for effective manage-
</p>
<p>ment. The system is a tool that can be used to assist in the efficient and effec-
tive operation of the purchasing and supply chain function.
</p>
<p>2. An effective system requires communication. Responsible personnel must
clearly understand the performance measure, its performance expectation,
and the role of the measure during the performance evaluation process.
</p>
<p>3. Measures must reinforce positive behavior and be positively linked to an orga-
nization&rsquo;s reward system and not serve as punitive tools. If management uses
the measures solely as a means to identify nonperforming individuals, nega-
tive, dysfunctional, or beat-the-system behavior may result.

Chain Improvement at
Accent Industries
</p>
<p>Accent Industries, a U.S.-based consumer goods company, manufactures products for di-
rect shipment to retailers worldwide. This company&rsquo;s strategy is to excel across various opera-
tional aspects of service by being the industry leader in price, service, and convenience.
Accent has developed a set of organizational objectives that it believes are critical to world-
wide success. These objectives include being a low-cost producer; providing the highest qual-
ity to customers; and offering the best customer service, delivery, and responsiveness in the
industry. The company has also developed a set of purchasing and supply chain perfor-
mance measures that it believes directly supports its organizational directives.
</p>
<p>When implementing its purchasing and supply chain measurement system, Accent followed a
series of defined steps:

<p>Chapter 19 Performance Measurement and Evaluation 735</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Step 1: Conduct cross-functional discussions and benchmarking to establish mea-
sures, measurement objectives, and performance targets.
</p>
<p>Step 2: Formalize measurement objectives into written policy and procedures.
</p>
<p>Step 3: Formally communicate measures and objectives to the supply base.
</p>
<p>Step 4: Receive feedback from suppliers.
</p>
<p>Step 5: Modify, if necessary, performance measures and their objectives.
</p>
<p>Step 6: Implement final distribution of the measurement objective and process.
</p>
<p>Step 7: Collect and maintain performance data.
</p>
<p>Accent relies on a wide range of purchasing and supply chain measures that relate directly to the
company&rsquo;s corporate objectives. A sample of the more critical measures include the following:
</p>
<p>QUALITY
&bull; Supplier defects in parts per million
</p>
<p>&bull; Internal manufacturing defects in parts per million
</p>
<p>&bull; Internal process capability
</p>
<p>&bull; Damage
</p>
<p>&bull; Number and cost of warranty claims
</p>
<p>PRICE/COST
&bull; Actual price to market price comparisons
</p>
<p>&bull; Price/cost reductions
</p>
<p>&bull; Tooling cost management
</p>
<p>&bull; Transportation cost management
</p>
<p>CYCLE TIMES
&bull; New-product development cycle time
</p>
<p>DELIVERY AND SERVICE
&bull; Supplier on-time delivery
</p>
<p>INVENTORY/FORECASTING
&bull; Total inventory dollar value over time
</p>
<p>&bull; Raw material, work-in-process, and finished-goods inventory turns
</p>
<p>&bull; Forecast accuracy
</p>
<p>Supplier quality performance is determined during on-site supplier visits and statistical in-
ferences from product receipts. The frequency of calculation varies with each supplier&rsquo;s cur-
rent quality levels. Suppliers with known quality problems or higher levels of defects are
targeted for more frequent measurement.
</p>
<p>Accent uses its performance measurement system to establish and convey performance objec-
tives, track progress, and promote continuous improvement.
</p>
<p>Each supplier is provided clear, comprehensive goals and timely feedback. Factors that are
critical to effective measurement include a process for establishing aggressive but attain-
able goals, supplier consensus that the goals are achievable, senior management support,
and accurate measurement with regular feedback.
</p>
<p>In the future the company plans to expand its use of total cost of ownership models for sup-
plier evaluation and selection. In addition, Accent wants to pursue the open measurement
and sharing of cost elements with its suppliers.

<p>CONCLUSION
A purchasing and supply chain performance measurement and management sys-
</p>
<p>tem should directly support corporate goals and objectives. A measurement system
that directs behavior and activity away from those goals and objectives is counterpro-
ductive and can cause greater harm than good.
</p>
<p>There is a need to create measurement systems that are responsive to change.
Firms will also increasingly require measures that focus on end results rather than on
specific activities. Emphasis will increasingly shift from efficiency measures to effec-
tiveness measures. In addition, executive management must have the ability to distin-
guish between good and poor purchasing practices and results. A well-developed
performance measurement and evaluation system can help provide this distinction.
The balanced scorecard is a useful approach to purchasing and supply measurement.

</p>
<p>6. Discuss the reasons why measuring and evaluating purchasing performance has
historically had certain problems or limitations. Do you think the purchasing func-
tion should increase or decrease its effort to measure performance? Why or why
not?
</p>
<p>7. Consider the following statement: Some firms still rely on measures that harm
rather than support purchasing&rsquo;s long-term performance objectives. What does
this mean? Provide examples of performance measures that might actually result
in a negative longer-term effect on purchasing performance.

<p>Supply Chain Integration Becomes a Reality
</p>
<p>Customer-focused supply chains that can better align and link the various firms mak-
ing up the supply chain are increasingly likely to gain competitive advantage. This can be ex-
emplified by Wal-Mart, Dell, and IBM examples. Supply chain integration with agreement on
goals, business strategies, and information transparency can have significant impacts on ca-
pacity investment, inventories, design, responsiveness, and support of a firm&rsquo;s worldwide
product/service development, operations/manufacturing, and sourcing footprints.
</p>
<p>An example, discussed here in more detail, is the Motorola supply chain integration. In 2005,
Motorola undertook the task of linking the various elements that make up its supply chains
worldwide. The objectives were cost, cash, and customer service. Cost competitiveness would
enable competitive pricing, cash would enable business investment, and customer service
would enable the retention of customers.
</p>
<p>The challenge was significant, as Motorola operates worldwide. Sales spanned all regions of
the globe and purchases came from suppliers in 47 countries (as of 2004), and in the past
the six business units generally did little sharing of resources or facilities.
</p>
<p>To achieve transformation to an integrated supply chain, the focus was to align and link prod-
uct design, procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service. In addition, the fol-
lowing six key steps provide a high-level process approach to implement the change:
</p>
<p>1. Identify best-in-class processes for duplication throughout the company
2. Develop a supply base that has been right-sized and improve working relation-
</p>
<p>ships with key suppliers
3. Establish clear-cut supplier quality expectations and provide performance feed-
</p>
<p>back via a performance scorecard
4. Establish most effective and efficient manufacturing and logistics operations
5. Focus information technology improvement projects to maximize the impact
</p>
<p>across all business units
6. Create an action-oriented and results-driven culture
</p>
<p>The results of the transformation by 2007 were dramatic. Examples are the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Various teams identified best-in-class practices and the highest-priority practices
were implemented worldwide.
</p>
<p>&bull; Business units work collaboratively to solicit quotes and award business.
&bull; Suppliers were required to develop &ldquo;quality renewal plans&rdquo; to continue to do work
</p>
<p>with Motorola, and Motorola provided performance data to suppliers.
&bull; Motorola&rsquo;s manufacturing and distribution operations square footage was reduced
</p>
<p>by 40% by examining its worldwide footprint and consolidating facilities.
&bull; Ninety percent of Motorola&rsquo;s information technology spend is now on systems that
</p>
<p>are common and help all business units&mdash;not just one.
&bull; In addition, a number of achievements as of year-end 2006 include reduced ppm
</p>
<p>defects from suppliers by 50%; achieved customer on-time deliveries of 85 to
92% at some business units (up from 30 to 40%); improved material expenses,
product quality, and manufacturing efficiency by 40%; and achieved an 18% im-
provement in inventory turns.
</p>
<p>Overall, this example suggests that a focused effort on integrating the vertical or functional
silos into a more integrated supply chain(s) can produce performance results. This supply
chain integration is a major ongoing challenge and will be the focus of future efforts.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>A common theme throughout this book is that the functional area called purchasing,
along with the activities that support supply chain management, are experiencing dra-
matic change. Once regarded as a reactive and administrative activity capable only of
neutral or negative contribution, purchasing and supply chain leaders and managers
must today be at the forefront of responding to and creating change. As a vice presi-
dent of a large manufacturing firm in the transportation industry commented, &ldquo;Over
60% of our revenue is spent with external suppliers, and effective purchasing and
world-class suppliers are absolutely required for us to be successful in the future.&rdquo;1
</p>
<p>This chapter outlines the real and projected changes and trends that have affected
and will continue to affect purchasing and supply chain professionals. These changes
and trends appear within eight areas and are based on a joint research initiative of
CAPS Research, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), and A.T. Kearney, Inc.2
</p>
<p>These areas are (1) expanding the mission, goals, and performance expectations of
purchasing and supply; (2) developing category strategies; (3) developing and manag-
ing suppliers; (4) designing and operating multiple supply networks; (5) leveraging
technology enablers; (6) collaborating internally and externally; (7) attracting and re-
taining supply management talent; and (8) managing and enabling the future supply
management organization and measurement systems. Much of the discussion in this
chapter is drawn from this recent and detailed study. In closing, a series of high-
impact strategies are presented.3
</p>
<p>Expanding the Mission, Goals, and
Performance Expectations
</p>
<p>Over the past five years and going forward, the mission, goals, and performance con-
tributions required of purchasing and supply by company executives have been increas-
ing and will continue to do so. Increasing contributions in cost reduction, effective
asset management, and revenue generation are being required by firms worldwide.
</p>
<p>In addition, external forces are continuously changing and will likely impact pur-
chasing and supply management&rsquo;s role and required contributions to a firm&rsquo;s success.
These forces include the following:
</p>
<p>1. Global competition
</p>
<p>2. Mergers, acquisitions, and supply market consolidation
</p>
<p>3. Increased governmental regulation
</p>
<p>4. Technology advances
</p>
<p>5. Customer and channel dynamics
</p>
<p>6. Increased product/service variety and shorter life cycles
</p>
<p>7. Social responsibilities
</p>
<p>8. Environmental responsibilities such as sustainability
</p>
<p>Each of these factors individually and in combination will influence change in pur-
chasing and supply strategies and practices, and increase complexity. The rate of fu-
ture business model and purchasing and supply transformations will also likely
quicken and impact purchasing and supply mission and goals.
</p>
<p>Overall, future purchasing and supply mission and goals will be broader and more
aligned with the strategic objectives of the firm. The future focus will be on several
supply chain performance areas including the following:

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1. Accelerating and obtaining more innovation from suppliers.
</p>
<p>2. Leveraging supplier capabilities and know-how to establish new sources of rev-
enue: e.g., leverage jointly developed technologies with suppliers for internal
use or for sale to other customers.
</p>
<p>3. Identifying and mitigating supply risks of any kind to ensure business continuity:
e.g., price volatility, potential supply disruptions, financially troubled suppliers,
negative impacts on sustainability and the environment, protection of intellectual
properties, and so forth.
</p>
<p>4. Expanding the breadth and depth of cost management efforts in areas such as
outsourcing/insourcing, non-traditional purchases, and purchase item stan-
dardization and complexity reduction.
</p>
<p>Innovation driving change in products, services, and processes will provide increasing
competitive advantage in the future. For example, the use of composites in the Boe-
ing 787; the iPod from Apple; and side-by-side, front-loading, and colorful washers
and dryers on a platform by Whirlpool all provide marketplace advantage. In addi-
tion, firms recognize that innovation cannot be totally achieved utilizing internal re-
sources alone, but must also tap supplier expertise in developing innovations.
</p>
<p>Purchasing and supply will also be expected to play a growing role in the sustain-
ability efforts of firms, many of which closely involve suppliers. For example, Tyler
Elm, vice president and senior director of corporate strategy and business sustainabil-
ity at Wal-Mart, recognized that in contrast to early campaigns, their new sustainabil-
ity strategy would need to be deeply embedded in Wal-Mart&rsquo;s operations and supply
chain management to meet the ambitious goals set in 2005. Elm put it this way: &ldquo;We
recognized early on that we had to look at the entire value chain. If we had focused
on just our own operations, we would have limited ourselves to 10% of our effect on
the environment and eliminated 90% of the opportunity that&rsquo;s out there.&rdquo;4 Pur-
chasers will have to fully understand sustainability issues and make appropriate deci-
sions based on sustainability considerations, which are growing in importance.
</p>
<p>However, the broadening role of supply management will not reduce the need
to continue to contribute to other important purchasing objectives, such as the fol-
lowing:
</p>
<p>&bull; Continuous improvement in purchase unit cost, quality, and delivery
performance.
</p>
<p>A CAPS Research project5 provides insight into the degree of supply performance
achievements across various important performance areas in 2007 based on responses
from 110 companies for the assessment question shown in Exhibit 20.1 on p. 746. The
primary focus was cost, quality, and delivery.
</p>
<p>Providing ongoing purchase price and cost reduction, combined with quality and
delivery performance improvement, is the minimum contribution expected of pur-
chasing and supply. Positive results in these areas are required in order to compete.
</p>
<p>&bull; The reduction of time, particularly during product and process
development.
</p>
<p>Although high quality, delivery, and low cost will always be important, time-
related capabilities have driven and will continue to drive the next generation of or-
der winners in the eyes of the customer. In particular, product and service support
and best customer service with short lead times and the ability to bring new products

<p>from concept to customer in the shortest time rival cost and quality as critical mar-
ket attributes.
</p>
<p>Most managers agree that reduced cycle times are essential for market success. Com-
petition is no longer between big and small but rather between fast and agile firms and
slow firms. Purchasing plays an important role in time-based competition because of
its ability to affect time-related processes and activities. For example, reducing material
delivery cycle times with suppliers can also help reduce internal manufacturing cycle
times.
</p>
<p>Faster supplier responsiveness supports faster responsiveness to end customer re-
quirements, particularly as planning horizons become shorter and less certain. Al-
though beyond the scope of this discussion, material ordering cycle time has four
components that supply chain practices affect directly: (1) transmission of require-
ments to suppliers, (2) suppliers&rsquo; ordering and manufacturing cycle time, (3) delivery
from suppliers, and (4) incoming receiving and inspection.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious area where firms are concentrating their time-reduction
efforts is during product and process development. Major changes have occurred in
the methods and time required for developing products and processes over the past
decade, such as the use of product development teams, rapid prototyping technolo-
gies, and computer-aided design systems shared with suppliers. As a result, average
product development cycle time has declined and is viewed as significantly important
by executive management.

<p>Developing Category Strategies Will Become
Broader and More Complex

<p>This second of the eight strategy areas critical to future success focuses on cate-
gory strategy development.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>In the decade ahead, companies will think differently about category strategies. The
purpose of a category strategy is to maximize value by leveraging external resources
and capabilities. In the future, changes in business models, degree of outsourcing, indus-
try structures, technologies, customer demands, environmental regulations, and other
factors will change both how value is defined and how external resources can help de-
liver it.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until the mid-1990s, many companies took a conservative approach to category
strategy development by buying the same components, products, and services that they
had always bought from the same markets and suppliers. The supply management func-
tion was charged primarily with securing the &lsquo;best&rsquo; price and ensuring supply.
</p>
<p>In addition, companies traditionally bought goods and services from the same
markets and suppliers. Today, companies are taking the next step by looking globally
for new suppliers, and defining strategies for new categories. For example, when con-
sidering to outsource business processes and activities to reduce costs, new categories
like contract manufacturing, facilities management, and logistics are established.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Companies are going even further by seeking suppliers with discrete capabilities
that can add new types of value and they are leveraging untapped competencies and
knowledge already in the supply base for an existing category. &ldquo;For example, a food
manufacturer utilized a flavoring supplier&rsquo;s knowledge and expertise to rationalize its
own ingredient base into flavor and additive &lsquo;modules&rsquo; that provide specific taste or
texture. Significant savings for the manufacturer and additional sales for the supplier
were achieved, also providing for time-to-market reductions, which was critical to
business success in their competitive space.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Companies will increasingly use value-based sourcing approaches to evaluate how
a supplier or group of suppliers may be utilized to gain competitive advantage for cate-
gories with high business impact.
</p>
<p>A robust category strategy will include multiple and concurrent initiatives, includ-
ing low-cost-country sourcing, design specification changes, switching suppliers to

<p>Sourcing

</p>
<p>Global Sourcing for World-
wide Competitiveness
</p>
<p>Firms are increasing their global footprint in search of suppliers in worldwide markets
for goods and services. Manitowoc Company, a large maker of cranes, is searching the world
for goods: industrial tires in China, bearings from the Midwest, and important chassis parts
from suppliers in Poland. At Manitowoc, purchasing and supply has been given executive-
level status, with an executive who can lead and manage complex outsourcing and global
sourcing decisions, who can establish global supplier relationships, and who is knowledge-
able about various foreign cultures. The company recognized that it had to establish a pur-
chasing executive to be in charge of purchasing for its 41 facilities in 14 countries across
three divisions. Maximizing opportunities to leverage company spend and ensure dependable
supply required worldwide sourcing and organizational and personnel transformations, all in
support of globalization, which will continue into the future.

<p>increase product innovation, and supplier development. &ldquo;Value&rdquo; will become better
defined and definitions accepted worldwide, and the application of sourcing total cost
and value-decision tools will increase.
</p>
<p>The breadth and scope of category strategies will also increase. Supply base reduc-
tion and global sourcing, especially from emerging markets, will continue to play an
important role. However, in the next decade, strategies will increasingly focus on to-
tal cost and value creation related to supply and supplier contributions through prod-
uct/service design and complexity reduction, supplier improvement initiatives, design
for supply chain effectiveness, and enhanced collaboration between suppliers to im-
prove performance and achieve sustainability. Category strategy time horizons will be
expanded to three to five years.
</p>
<p>Strategy Formulation and Selection
&ldquo;A supply network focus (versus an individual supplier focus) for category strat-
</p>
<p>egy development will be increasingly applied. Supply networks, many of which will
be in competition with other networks, will require that leading companies develop
strategies that leverage the capabilities of all suppliers that make up specific supply net-
works supporting end-customer demand for goods and services. Category strategies

<p>General Motors Corporation is increasing the China purchasing staff, which is expected
to develop suppliers in China. The purchasing staff will increase from the 200 working with
suppliers in Shanghai and the office staff will also increase in Beijing and Guangzhou. GM
currently has 198 suppliers in China and is working with over 300 China suppliers to assist
them in becoming global suppliers to GM.

<p>Parts Standardization
</p>
<p>Bosch is asking for parts standardization because of significant investment demands
being placed on automakers and parts suppliers. Bosch further pointed out that the com-
pany made 44 different heads for the ABS speed sensor, as one example of many. The func-
tionality of all of the sensors is basically the same and the variation could be significantly
reduced, yielding economies of scale and possible cost reductions. If there were parts stan-
dardization, cost reduction of 5 to 10%, and possibly up to 30%, could be achieved for cer-
tain products. Teamwork between OEMs and suppliers, required to cut costs, is an important
consideration. How effective purchasing is in working collaboratively with suppliers in the fu-
ture will be a competitive differentiator.

<p>in the fast-changing future that align, link, and achieve collaborative efforts by compa-
nies throughout the supply network will strongly influence future success.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Outsourcing of Non&ndash;Core Competencies
A focus on core competencies and capabilities has influenced the strategic plan-
</p>
<p>ning process and category strategy development at most firms, and will continue to
do so in the decade ahead. There will always be debate about which activities or opera-
tions should be performed internally and which should be outsourced. Because
purchasing deals extensively with external sources, it becomes involved with the in-
sourcing/outsourcing process. The trend toward outsourcing should continue, al-
though firms have to be careful about being too aggressive with their outsourcing strat-
egy or relying on outsourcing partners that do not fulfill their performance promises.
There are a number of reasons why an emphasis on outsourcing will continue:
</p>
<p>&bull; As mentioned earlier, the pressure to reduce costs is severe and will only
increase.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost-reduction pressures are forcing organizations to use their productive re-
sources more efficiently. As a result, executive management will increasingly
rely on insourcing/outsourcing decisions to provide a way to effectively man-
age costs.
</p>
<p>&bull; Firms are continuing to become more highly specialized in product and pro-
cess technology. Increased specialization implies focused investment in a pro-
cess or technology, which contributes to greater cost differentials among firms.
</p>
<p>&bull; Firms will increasingly focus more on what they excel at while outsourcing
areas of nonexpertise. Some organizations are formally defining their core
competencies to help guide the insourcing/outsourcing effort. This has af-
fected decisions concerning what businesses a firm should engage in.
</p>
<p>&bull; The need for responsiveness in the marketplace is increasingly affecting in-
sourcing/outsourcing decisions. Shorter cycle times, for example, encourage
greater outsourcing with less vertical integration. The time to develop a produc-
tion capability or capacity may exceed the window available to enter a new
market.
</p>
<p>&bull; Wall Street recognizes and rewards firms that achieve higher return on in-
vestment. Because insourcing usually requires an assumption of fixed assets
(and increased human capital), financial pressures are causing managers to
closely examine sourcing decisions. Avoidance of increased fixed costs is mo-
tivating many firms to rely on external rather than internal assets.
</p>
<p>&bull; Improved computer simulation tools and forecasting software enable firms
to perform insourcing/outsourcing comparisons with greater precision.
These tools allow the user to perform sensitivity (what-if) analysis that per-
mits comparisons of different sourcing possibilities.
</p>
<p>&bull; Globalization and finding lower-cost sources in emerging countries continue
to promote outsourcing.
</p>
<p>Concluding Observations
Category strategies are required to define the supply base (internal and external),

designs, and physical supply chain considerations and are developed from the

<p>bottom up by category teams to meet business objectives and customer requirements.
These strategies do and will go far beyond volume aggregation or a unit price reduc-
tion focus. In the future, value elements will strongly influence category strategies,
the development of which will become an increasingly important part of the com-
pany strategy. More effective teams with improved personnel and truly global, cross-
functional representation will be required.
</p>
<p>Category strategies will become more complex and require both internal func-
tional and executive engagement across enterprises. Category strategies will be more
agile because they will have to be quickly reconfigured as conditions change. Strategy
development will include approaches to influence supply markets and supply net-
works. Category strategies will increasingly aim to block competition, and early warn-
ing or predictive approaches will be used as part of an improved approach to risk
within the strategies.

<p>Developing and Managing Suppliers as a Truly
Extended Part of the Organization
</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the decade ahead, the development of a competitive worldwide supply base
and suppliers that collaboratively help to create value in support of the buying com-
pany&rsquo;s business models will become the norm. This focus will be driven by global
competition, continuous outsourcing, and the need to develop supply chains for inno-
vative products and services to meet unique customer requirements worldwide.&rdquo; Lead-
ing sustainability efforts with suppliers will increase in importance.
</p>
<p>Sourcing
Snapshot
</p>
<p>Sustainability and
Leadership
</p>
<p>Leading sustainability efforts internally and with suppliers will require significant pur-
chasing and supply transformation in the future to ensure competitiveness. Customer buying
decisions may become increasingly concerned about how &ldquo;green&rdquo; their supplier is. S.C. John-
son&rsquo;s approach provides one example of this transformation.
</p>
<p>The company works to improve the environmental impact of the raw materials it purchases.
Suppliers and S.C. Johnson work to improve the environment by producing more environmen-
tally friendly ingredients and also improving raw material choices to produce green products.
</p>
<p>To support the green efforts, S.C. Johnson developed &ldquo;Greenlist,&rdquo; an environmental classifica-
tion system that rates ingredients on four to seven criteria such as biodegradability and
aquatic toxicity. Scoring ranges from 3 (best) to 0 (indicates that the material is only used
with special permission, and that a substitute for the raw material must be found).
</p>
<p>The results of this effort internally and with suppliers have been very successful. Examples in-
clude the following:
</p>
<p>&bull; Increased the use of better and best materials significantly by more than 13 mil-
lion kilograms
</p>
<p>&bull; Eliminated millions of kilograms of 0-rated materials
&bull; Phased out chlorine-based external packaging materials worldwide

<p>&ldquo;In addition, based on the increasing availability of information about the forces af-
fecting industry supply and demand, cost structures, and supplier capabilities, includ-
ing financial conditions and product/service costs, we may be entering into an era
more characterized by companies looking for ways to strategically leverage key sup-
plier/buyer capabilities for innovation and &lsquo;enlarging the pie&rsquo; rather than playing the
zero-sum game whereby one company&rsquo;s gain may be at the expense of the other. The
importance of strategic partners, both buyers and sellers, will likely increase.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;These factors will affect which supply networks a supplier will choose to join.
The buying company at the heart of a given supply network will need to develop phi-
losophies, attitudes, and practices that will give suppliers the opportunities to jointly
achieve financial and other benefits. Emphasis will be placed on more cooperative ver-
sus adversarial approaches, including selective information transparency between stra-
tegically aligned buyers and sellers&mdash;and among the suppliers in a network.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In the decade ahead, companies will put significant effort into strategically structur-
ing their supply bases to support the business model and category strategies. As world-
wide outsourcing continues, combined with the need for value creation and innovation
from suppliers, establishing the best suppliers globally grows in importance.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the future, companies will more carefully and strategically answer the follow-
ing questions to most effectively structure the supply base for each of their purchase
category families.
</p>
<p>&bull; How many suppliers do we want for this category (and in the supply base)
and what role should each play?
</p>
<p>&bull; What current and future capabilities are required and where in the world
should the supplier(s) be located?
</p>
<p>&bull; Which suppliers should we work with and why?
</p>
<p>&bull; Do we want to lead and/or manage supplier networks at the Tier 2 and 3 levels?
</p>
<p>&bull; Which suppliers do we want to collaborate with, or have them collaborate
with other suppliers, and why?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Improving Supplier Relationships
Making significant improvements in working relationships with key suppliers will
</p>
<p>be increasingly critical to gain supplier innovation and preferential customer treat-
ment in the years ahead. Companies will have to more effectively structure their sup-
ply base by category and identify those suppliers that are truly strategic and capable

<p>The beneficiary of environmentally favorable philosophies and principles laid down throughout
12 decades of business, S.C. Johnson believes it must still work closely with many organiza-
tions that have varying agendas and priorities. However, what is found among a disparate
supplier community is widespread and common acceptance of Greenlist and its objectives&mdash;
and a genuine enthusiasm for helping meet those objectives. The recent scale of successes
at S.C. Johnson would not have been possible without the active collaboration of suppliers&mdash;
and without a clear process to guide collaboration.

<p>of providing innovation. Attitudes about the approaches to be used when working
with these most important suppliers will have to be further developed and move
from purely adversarial to more collaborative.
</p>
<p>To enhance future working relationships with important suppliers, the following
elements must be in place:
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier segmentation
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier scorecards and feedback
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier capability matrices
</p>
<p>&bull; Rewards to best performers
</p>
<p>&bull; Joint executive meetings
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier councils and conferences
</p>
<p>&bull; Process improvement and innovation workshops

<p>&bull; Two-way performance evaluations and satisfaction surveys
</p>
<p>&bull; Supplier suggestion systems
</p>
<p>&bull; Risk/reward sharing
</p>
<p>&bull; Executive engagement
</p>
<p>&bull; Trust
</p>
<p>The future requirement is the holistic implementation of all of the above, not just
two or three elements. Today, many firms are limited in their implementation of the
above elements.
</p>
<p>Concluding Observations about Supply Base
Management
</p>
<p>Three dominant themes emerge for the future. First, the purchasing management
function will have to clearly determine company needs and align with suppliers that
have the necessary current and future capabilities to meet typical performance objec-
tives, provide innovation, and help create value to support company business model(s)
</p>

<p>Ford Aligned Business
Framework
</p>
<p>In 2005, Ford Motor Company established the Aligned Business Framework, an attempt
to improve Ford&rsquo;s supplier relations. The plan included reducing the number of suppliers
by half and providing longer-term business to those that remained together with early ac-
cess to new-product programs.
</p>
<p>However, at the same time, the financial condition of the firm deteriorated and much of the
purchasing focus was on price reductions. Even though the degree of cooperation that was de-
sired was not fully achieved and supplier relations remained combative, respondents to a sup-
plier survey say that the Aligned Business Framework program has met or exceeded
expectations. Access to Ford&rsquo;s senior management has improved, and purchasers and en-
gineers are starting to collaborate. This progress is significant.

<p>and competitiveness. Second, working relationships between buying and selling compa-
nies, strategically important to each other, must improve to unlock value-creating po-
tential. Third, the future will require more bilateral (or multilateral) and collaborative
approaches as opposed to dictatorial and price-dominated approaches in companies
that want to achieve value creation through the supply base.
</p>
<p>Designing and Operating Multiple Supply Networks
to Meet Customer Requirements
</p>
<p>Supply chains that are seamless and driven by end user or customer needs will be
required. Revenues will flow to companies that can get the correct product or service
bundles to customers at the lowest landed and total costs. Supply chain innovation
and different supply chains to meet different customer segments will be key to future
revenue and market share growth, for example, having different supply chains for
short product life cycle cell phones versus mature and longer product life cycle televi-
sions at a consumer electronics firm.
</p>
<p>In addition, companies like Dell and Wal-Mart raised the bar with supply chains
that operate effectively on cost, quality, and responsiveness measures while adding a
new dimension: the ability to identify and respond to change in a timely manner, pro-
viding advantage over less agile competitors.
</p>
<p>In tomorrow&rsquo;s world, the ability to respond to change will be the price of admis-
sion to compete. &ldquo;Competitive advantage will require agility, while supply chain excel-
lence will be defined by the ability to:
</p>
<p>&bull; Anticipate changes worldwide in customer requirements, product offerings,
supply conditions, regulations, and competitor actions
</p>
<p>&bull; Adapt to the changes by reconfiguring existing supply chains or creatively as-
sembling new ones
</p>
<p>&bull; Accelerate implementation of the transformed supply chain to capture the
new opportunities ahead of the competition
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make-to-order or assemble-to-order product/service bundles that fill distinct and
possibly numerous market niches will quite obviously require the management of sev-
eral supply chains simultaneously on a global scale&mdash;only multiple supply chains will
be able to make a company this flexible.&rdquo; Purchasing and supply and suppliers at
Tiers 1, 2, and even 3 will play a key role in supply chain success. Lack of availability
or a quality problem at a Tier 2 supplier can create significant end customer perfor-
mance problems.
</p>
<p>Concluding Observations
Many supply chain design strategies, approaches, and solutions are available to as-
</p>
<p>sist companies. Significant amounts of information provide concepts and ideas about
how to meet market and customer needs. Almost all companies, market niches, and
customers have different needs. However, a supply chain design that works at one or-
ganization will not necessarily work for others. Companies that do not carefully tai-
lor their supply chains will find their efforts resulting in poor performance or broken
supply chains. To achieve success, supply chains will have to be segmented and cus-
tomer focused within an organization, with strong supplier networks.

<p>Leveraging Technology Enablers
Takes on Additional Focus
</p>
<p>There will be continuing improvements to supply management e-system applica-
tions over the next decade, coupled with technological advances integrating applica-
tions and data to enhance people&rsquo;s personal effectiveness and collaboration. We will
have continued refinements of technologies already introduced.
</p>
<p>Spend management will continue to increase its flexibility for analytics and will be
more easily implemented&mdash;companies will be less challenged by the need to perform
setup data cleansing. Spend management will also become more closely aligned with
specific contract provisions. Purchasing will more fully move to a digitized and paper-
less world and tactical activities will become more automated.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Optimization will continue to expand features to e-sourcing as the discipline be-
comes more sophisticated. Contract management software will become more inte-
grated with spend management, particularly in terms of compliance. Collaboration
software will also enhance the ability to streamline the contract management process.
Performance monitoring and capability mapping will continue to expand supply man-
agement&rsquo;s potential. The flexibility provided by user definition and role-based access
will enrich the potential for added supply management. E-systems will increasingly
provide cross-enterprise visibility and transparency and link to companywide enter-
prise resource planning systems.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Linking Collaboration Tools to Product Life Cycle
Management
</p>
<p>By linking collaboration tools to product life cycle management technologies, the
influence and visibility that supply management has over interactions with engineer-
ing and operations, both internally and with suppliers, will be extended.

<p>Engaging Suppliers Earlier
in Product/Service Design
and Standardization
</p>
<p>Chrysler LLC believed that its interiors lacked refinement in recent years. To change
this situation, Chrysler began to bring suppliers into the design process much earlier, some
at least two years before the design freeze. The objective was to try more variations and
choose the correct materials. It was believed that in the past, suppliers were chosen too late
to fully evaluate design options. Now management can make better design decisions and de-
cide what materials to spend money on. This transformation to truly implement the extended
enterprise will require that purchasing and supply find innovative suppliers and construct
business deals to accelerate supplier innovation for the benefit of the buying company.

<p>&ldquo;For example, Toyota leads the automotive industry in profitability and time to
market because it is the leader in design commonality and parts reuse. Collaboration
tools play a critical role in achieving these goals; through the use of these tools the
company&rsquo;s suppliers actively share and collaborate with Toyota.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, other industries are adopting collaboration tools. For example, Procter &amp;
Gamble uses the same tools as GM to facilitate its brand management and product de-
velopment processes from idea generation through production. The tools offer data in-
tegration capabilities to help manage product formulations, packaging design and
artwork, and labeling regulations. As a result, P&amp;G reduced its new-product launch
time by 50% and has an almost error-free process for producing artwork and labels.
P&amp;G plans to look at Tier 2 and 3 suppliers for innovation as well as for supply
assurance.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>For supply management executives, the information provided by collaboration
tools will play a critical role in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of sourcing
initiatives. The data from these tools will help supply executives understand spend by
item number, purchase item, and supplier. The level of specification information pro-
vided will make discussions with suppliers much more productive and also allow engi-
neering and supply management to work more effectively together.

<p>Sourcing E-Tools at Harris
</p>
<p>Harris has focused much of its recent transformation attention on the information it
needs to determine which suppliers can provide the best-suited products at the lowest over-
all cost. The company has established a companywide database infrastructure to capture
and store data, processes, and e-system applications.
</p>
<p>The e-system transformation took two to three years to somewhat fully develop. Harris now
has the ability to view the entire business and drive collaborative decision making with the
capabilities in place.
</p>
<p>Harris has implemented numerous buying tools, including an internally developed program
called EXPO. This is an enterprisewide portal that connects Harris&rsquo;s four divisions, the ERP
programs, and company engineers. The system provides for internal collaboration and billing
and enables direct e-system communications with suppliers. EXPO enables Harris to deter-
mine parts quality performance, assess whether a part is environmentally safe, view inven-
tory records, identify the type of supplier to which the purchase item is sourced, and
so forth.
</p>
<p>In addition, Harris uses Oracle&rsquo;s Agile product life cycle management software to help man-
age product life cycle decisions throughout the company. Harris also uses Indecka&rsquo;s search
engine technology to help product development engineers locate parts to meet specific techni-
cal requirements. This enables engineers to specify parts that are early in their product life cy-
cle and that meet Harris&rsquo;s cost targets. Harris also uses Dun &amp; Bradstreet&rsquo;s financial alerts
to determine the financial status of a supplier and other profile information.

<p>Concluding Observations
Overall, technology will move from standalone, serially connected application to inte-
</p>
<p>grated, collaboration-based, flexible systems emphasizing collaboration, user-defined
analysis, and knowledge management, as shown in Exhibit 20.2. Reporting will be on-
demand, and the purchasing function will become more digitized and paperless. Cross-
enterprise transparency will increase, as will collaboration enabled by technology.
</p>
<p>Collaborating Internally and Externally
Will Grow in Strategic Importance
</p>
<p>Collaboration with suppliers is quite frequently identified as an important success
factor in achieving competitiveness. However, supplier collaboration may not easily
fit in with the traditional view of supply management&rsquo;s role in many organizations.
Four main themes around collaboration were established for the decade ahead by the
CAPS, ISM, and AT Kearney study:
</p>
<p>1. Internal collaboration and integration will be enhanced to meet future com-
pany needs.
</p>
<p>2. External collaboration will signal a shift from pure competition to coopera-
tion for some segments of a company&rsquo;s supply base.

<p>3. Technology is required to enable an increase in collaboration&mdash;providing for
both internal and external information transparency.
</p>
<p>4. Management risk and protecting intellectual property may limit collaboration
with suppliers.
</p>
<p>Purchasing and supply management, combined with other functional leadership and
company executives, will have to establish the company strategy and policies govern-
ing collaborative efforts with suppliers (and customers). Significant changes in atti-
tudes, strategies, practices, and working relationships will be required.
</p>
<p>Obtaining Innovation
&ldquo;In the future, companies will need to use collaboration to keep their innovation
</p>
<p>pipeline filled. For some, this may be as simple as having purchasing interface with
their own product development organization as well as their suppliers.&rdquo; More com-
plex collaboration will enable companies to link internal technological advances to de-
mands of external customers.
</p>
<p>Linking customer needs to supplier capabilities will continue to be complex, requir-
ing enhancements of approaches to and attitudes about collaboration.
</p>
<p>Concluding Observations
In the past, supply management has focused on establishing a competitive environ-
</p>
<p>ment for purchasing&mdash;a practice enhanced through cross-functional category sourc-
ing teams working to achieve competitive advantage. In the future, there will be an
increased need for systematic approaches for creating and operating collaboratively
with strategic suppliers. Collaboration will be enhanced by technology linked to prod-
uct life cycle management software along with access to networks that ease internal
collaboration and working with external suppliers. In addition, suppliers and supply
personnel must be convinced that the openness and trust needed in a genuinely col-
laborative environment will generate positive performance results.
</p>
<p>Attracting, Developing, and Retaining Supply
Management Talent Will Become a Key
Differentiator for Success
</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal will be expected of tomorrow&rsquo;s purchasing and supply management
professionals, as they will be charged with developing and executing value acquisition
strategies that find new value in the supply base, deliver value as quickly as possible
within the cost parameters defined by the demand market, and maximize the return
to the company. To do so, they will need to find and leverage external sources of inno-
vation, contribute to revenue generation, expand efforts to manage costs, and ensure
business continuity and sustainability.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>To achieve all of these requirements, supply management professionals will need
the skills and capabilities to understand and interpret supply market dynamics, ana-
lyze complex supply options and risks, and develop innovative value acquisition strate-
gies that integrate with and support business and functional strategies. Supply leaders
will also be asked to create and manage collaborative supplier relationships and lead

sents an overview of the many skills and capabilities that supply management profes-
sionals will need to succeed.
</p>
<p>Current and Future Supply Management Skills
The foundational skills for supply will continue to center upon a combination of sup-
</p>
<p>ply market knowledge and supply process expertise, including competitive market struc-
ture and price and cost models. Also required will be awareness of the future forces at
work on the industry (e.g., emerging supply markets sustainability, merger and acquisi-
tion activity, potential new entrants, and technology trends). &ldquo;Requirements for supply
will include the ability to develop robust forward-looking strategies, to conduct a rigor-
ous sourcing effort using data collection and analysis tools, to carry out negotiations
and contracting, and to drive supplier development/operational improvement programs
(including applying tools such as lean and Six Sigma).&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Cross-Functional Skills and Teaming
&ldquo;Supply management professionals will increasingly need both broader general busi-
</p>
<p>ness knowledge and multidiscipline skills. A working knowledge of business funda-
mentals including finance, accounting, and business law, and project management
skills, as well as exposure to/experience in operations, engineering, product and service
development, marketing and sales, and business planning, will help supply profes-
sionals to work effectively across functional and organizational boundaries. Understand-
ing how their own business and key suppliers operate and compete will also be key.
Understanding will help enhance overall value received, reduce costs, and ensure busi-
ness continuity.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>The use of cross-functional teams will be an important supply management strat-
egy because they provide a broader base of knowledge for decision making and can
lead to decisions that take into account the needs of all the major stakeholders in the
organization. Including internal users on sourcing teams acknowledges their expertise

to better supplier agreements, in which internal users have a vested interest. Cross-
functional teams will be used in particular for category and supplier strategy develop-
ment and implementation.
</p>
<p>Cross-functional teams focused on and for process and system improvement pro-
cesses will also be critical in the future. Companies will develop global systems capabil-
ity and functional processes to align their global systems. However, problems will
arise when global processes are not supported by cross-functional teams. Companies
may have best-in-class financial, operational, and supply chain processes, but there
may still be significant &ldquo;white space&rdquo; or disconnects between the functional processes.
Cross-functional teams will be used to help fill this organizational white space and
connect the disparate systems.

<p>Teamwork and Coopera-
tion Come Slowly
between Functions
</p>
<p>Companies are taking steps to get different departments to work together effectively,
but they&rsquo;re still falling short of the goal. And although most purchasing professionals agree
that teamwork and cooperation are the best mechanisms for getting different corporate func-
tions to work together, they also point out that neither attribute exists naturally in a corpo-
rate setting.
</p>
<p>The results of a recent survey indicate that although there are good signs of cooperation be-
tween corporate departments, many companies are not doing enough to foster cooperation be-
tween purchasing and other functions. Even worse, many such efforts are actually
counterproductive. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much competition among departments,&rdquo; says Ronald Bliz-
zard, materials administrator for Massachusetts-based Guilford Rail System. His response
was typical of many purchasers who say that long-standing rivalries between groups do not
die easily or quickly.
</p>
<p>Most of the survey participants say their companies are not taking the most effective ap-
proach to the problem of promoting teamwork and cooperation.
</p>
<p>Some survey respondents say that employees themselves are the root of the problem, that
staff members simply refuse to play along or work well with others. But the majority of sur-
vey respondents lay the responsibility at the feet of management. They say whatever process
is adopted, it must receive the blessing and support of upper management. Too often, the de-
partments of production, planning, design, quality, and purchasing have different leaders to
answer to. Those who have watched this process work well report that their purchasing de-
partments were successfully linked with operations management, logistics and planning, ma-
terials, and warehouse receiving/shipping departments.
</p>
<p>Management must continually reinforce the common goal of teamwork, reminding employees
that they are part of a company, not only a department.

<p>Cross-Cultural Skills
The ability to work cross-culturally, with foreign-language skills, will increase in
</p>
<p>importance as companies further expand around the world and continue to out-
source globally and pursue suppliers in emerging markets. Individuals with interna-
tional experience bring a broader perspective and understanding of how to be
effective in different cultures.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soft-Side&rdquo; Skills
Strong &ldquo;soft-side&rdquo; skills will be a key determinant of success. Soft skills of impor-
</p>
<p>tance include a collaborative working style, an innovative spirit that challenges current
approaches and seeks innovative solutions to problems, and having leadership abilities.
In the future, the ability to lead virtual, geographically dispersed teams will be critical,
driven by cross-functional and cross-organizational initiatives, more globalization, and
a shortage of talent, and enabled by the application of collaboration technology.

</p>
<p>knowledge and skills will likely be the most competitive. To gain this differential ad-
vantage in talent, broader and worldwide hiring practices will have to be enhanced.

<p>Measuring Future Pur-
chasing Skill Requirements
</p>
<p>As the purchaser&rsquo;s job has evolved, so have the skills needed to handle both day-to-
day and strategic tasks. What&rsquo;s lacking, however, is a corporate understanding of how to eval-
uate those skills and define expectations for higher-level procurement positions, according to
Larry Giunipero, who authored the study A Skills-Based Analysis of the World-Class Pur-
chaser for the Center for Advanced Purchasing Studies.
</p>
<p>According to Giunipero&rsquo;s report, companies that will show the way in this area must continu-
ally assess the skills and knowledge of their purchasers, measure those skills against an
ideal, make training convenient and readily available to their purchasers, understand the im-
portance of having suppliers involved in the training process, and establish quantifiable
metrics that can be converted into measurable training goals.
</p>
<p>To get to the next level, companies should consider devising a weighted skill matrix, a tech-
nique that defines the skills required by individuals for a particular position and uses a rat-
ing scale where each number represents proficiency in a particular skill set. Before setting
up the matrix, however, companies must define what skills are needed for the position today
and in the future. From there, companies can evaluate the level of skills currently demon-
strated and identify the gaps between an ideal skill set and what an employee possesses.
Once those gaps are defined, top management and the purchasing department can establish
a plan to foster the future growth of skills.

<p>professionals will also grow in importance and require that the company be viewed
as a &ldquo;best&rdquo; or &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; or &ldquo;exciting&rdquo; place to work in supply.
</p>
<p>Managing and Enabling the Future
Supply Management Organization and
Measurement Systems
</p>
<p>The currently dominant center-led model for supply management will continue to
be a key strategy over the next decade, and will likely be the norm. This is especially
true as organizations better develop the balance between companywide advantages
from scale and expertise and product/service, business unit needs such as continuity
of supply, and fast product/service development with perfect launch. Decentralized
supply strategies will not dominate.
</p>
<p>However, a significant issue is how to integrate purchasing and supply manage-
ment with the rest of the organization. The most likely scenarios are shown in
Exhibit 20.4.
</p>
<p>In one scenario, purchasing/supply will become part of a larger supply chain func-
tion, which would have responsibility for all functions on both the demand and sup-
ply sides of the firm, required to meet customer needs. Specific activities on the
demand side that virtually touch the customer would not generally be included.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second likely scenario, supply management will take on a leading role to man-
age both external and internal supply. The top supply management role will closely re-
semble today&rsquo;s chief operating officer&rsquo;s job description.&rdquo; In this organizational structure,

<p>supply will manage all of the external supply base. Doing so will require a tight integra-
tion with operations, engineering, and internal customers to help ensure the proper
management of new-product introductions and continuous improvement in legacy
products and processes.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under this model, supply management will have near-complete responsibility for
the management of all expenditures in the corporation. The supply management
leader would act as the chief cost management officer.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Exhibit 20.5 further illustrates the increasing focus on horizontal structures inte-
grating various functions. To be competitive in the decade ahead, more cross-func-
tional and customer-focused integration will be necessary.
</p>
<p>Measuring Supply Management Performance
&ldquo;Today, supply managers think that they have good alignment between measures
</p>
<p>of supply performance and linkage with corporate measures and that this linkage will
become more important in the decade ahead. Not surprisingly, they also think they
currently have good operational measures for supply management and that it will be
highly important to maintain these measures over the next decade.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In addition to the importance of internal metrics, supply managers feel that com-
mon metrics across trading partners in the supply chain will be an important strat-
egy going forward and believe improvement is needed. Supply measures will
increasingly become customer centric. For example, measuring the ability of the firm
to meet significant customer schedule or demand shifts, product redesign and reliabil-
ity of performance will be linked back to purchasing and supply. Also, as companies
become larger and spread more widely across the globe, relevant and effective met-
rics will be developed to manage and control the global operations. Furthermore, met-
rics will be needed that clearly link the performance of supply management to the

<p>strategic performance of the organization. Measurement systems linking purchasing
and supply more directly to a firm&rsquo;s economic value-add or return on invested capi-
tal will be utilized. A balanced scorecard approach to measuring the contribution of
supply management to the success of the company will be in common use.
</p>
<p>Concluding Observations
The traditional view has held that only a centralist model provides companies the
</p>
<p>ability to leverage the category, supply, and talent strategies discussed. However, given
the global nature of some businesses, the need for a local focus and information tech-
nologies suggests the need to better balance the scale benefits of center-led approaches
with agility in meeting business unit needs. Strategic business units (SBUs) or regional
organizations may become the highest organizational level around which supply activi-
ties are managed in the largest organizations. However, the center-led model will pre-
dominate at either the company or SBU level.
</p>
<p>In addition, purchasing and supply will become more integrated with other com-
pany functions such as engineering, operations, and finance. Performance measures
will become more customer focused within a balanced scorecard and tightly coupled
to a firm&rsquo;s financial performance.

<p>Twelve High-Impact Sourcing and Supply Chain
Strategies for 2009&ndash;2015
</p>
<p>The Project 10X Executive Assessment conducted by CAPS Research,6 combined
with Succeeding in a Dynamic World: Supply Management in the Decade Ahead, have
identified 12 key purchasing and supply strategies that firms need to focus on to
achieve competitive success in the future. These strategies, which build on our prior
discussions, provide a very focused approach to achieving excellence for leading
companies:
</p>
<p>1. Continuous outsourcing determination and globalization of supply with
greater focus on risk management with key suppliers.
</p>
<p>2. Enhanced supply chain integration and collaboration with strategic suppliers.
</p>
<p>3. Increased information sharing and transparency internally and with suppliers.
</p>
<p>4. Sourcing becoming more integrated with other functions, processes, and custo-
mers including external customer-facing activities.
</p>
<p>5. Enhancing the quality, number, and execution of written purchase family/sup-
plier category strategies with a focus on value, including the total supply
network.
</p>
<p>6. Selectively ensuring the adequacy of sourcing and supply strategies as a
means to accelerate and obtain innovation from suppliers.
</p>
<p>7. Requiring suppliers to take a greater cost management role by providing
value-adding services in research and development, manufacturing/operations,
customer order fulfillment, and system integration.
</p>
<p>8. Providing common customer-focused measurements and metrics across the
supply chain.
</p>
<p>9. Developing an e-sourcing and supply applications portfolio including digi-
tized and paperless supplier invoicing, e-sourcing (with the Internet and

systems, combined with internal applications focused on analytics.
</p>
<p>10. Supply taking a leading role in sustainability with suppliers.
</p>
<p>11. Strategic sourcing and supply chain activities primarily center-led, with appro-
priate activities being located at sites worldwide, and with decentralized execu-
tion on a global basis.
</p>
<p>12. Human resources strategies and dedicated personnel focusing on identifying,
hiring, and developing highly talented, flexible, and globally oriented person-
nel, who can immediately contribute&mdash;a critical success factor.

<p>Good Practice
Example
</p>
<p>Cessna Transforms to
Achieve Leading-Edge
Sourcing and Supply
Status
</p>
<p>Charles B. Johnson, president and COO of Cessna, pointed out, &ldquo;As our supply chain pro-
cesses house the majority of our cost, it was necessary to create a more strategically
aligned supply chain that yielded the most competitive quality, delivery, flexibility, and
value.&rdquo; This was a major driver underlying the transformation process at Cessna. Under the
leadership of Michael R. Katzorke, supply chain management senior vice president, supply
chain management at Cessna has created a long-range strategic plan and cross-functional
commodity teams. The purpose was to rationalize the company&rsquo;s supplier base. In addition,
Cessna developed a Maturity Path Development tool that aligned suppliers and Cessna strat-
egy. They also revised the company&rsquo;s sales, inventory, and operations plan (SIOP), aimed at
improving performance to customer expectations and reducing inventory turns. Malcolm Bal-
drige National Quality Award criteria and Six Sigma quality tools were used to drive im-
provement in supplier performance. A value analysis/value engineering process was also
introduced, encouraging supplier involvement in removing cost from the supply chain.
</p>
<p>Katzorke and the supply chain management team have involved suppliers in supporting Cess-
na&rsquo;s corporate &ldquo;High Five&rdquo; objectives of total customer satisfaction, world quality standards
for aviation, breakthrough operating performance, top 10 company to work for, and superior fi-
nancial results. Clearly Cessna&rsquo;s sourcing and supply strategy transformation is aimed at con-
tributing to overall company objectives.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the biggest achievement of Katzorke and his team,&rdquo; says Johnson, &ldquo;has been the en-
gagement of the organization in the Cessna supply chain transformation process from a trans-
actional purchasing organization to an integrated full supply chain process.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Katzorke has stated: &ldquo;For breakthrough change, we needed the vision, skills, incentives, re-
sources, and action plan fully linked across the entire business.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>One of the key transformation elements in achieving an integrated supply chain is the use of
cross-functional commodity teams. These teams include representatives of supply chain
management, manufacturing engineering, quality engineering, product design engineering,
reliability engineering, product support, and finance. The teams work to drive supplier im-
provement and integration of suppliers into Cessna&rsquo;s design and manufacturing process,
thereby integrating critical components of the supply chain. There are six commodity teams

<p>for direct materials and one for indirect materials and services. Each team has a strategic
plan linked to the CEO&rsquo;s strategic objectives, which are updated annually.
</p>
<p>One key task of the commodity teams was to rationalize the supply base, which they did, re-
sulting in a reduction from 3,000 to 132 suppliers. Remaining suppliers were then classified
into growth suppliers, where Cessna&rsquo;s business will grow; provisional suppliers, whose future
prospects are uncertain; and phase-out suppliers, whose business with Cessna is about to
end. The teams then formed long-term partnerships with the growth suppliers, aligning the
supply base contractually in terms of objectives, strategies, processes and data, and supply
chain integration. Today, growth suppliers receive 77% of Cessna&rsquo;s business. The teams are
also further integrating suppliers into Cessna&rsquo;s design, manufacturing, and other key pro-
cesses so that they become fully integrated with and part of Cessna&rsquo;s business.
</p>
<p>Cessna also developed a new process that included demand and SIOP processes. Suppliers
have clear visibility to production plans and capacity planning interfaces, focusing on end-
customer demand. This high-level review of Cessna illustrates the magnitude and company
emphasis being placed on developing leading-edge purchasing and supply strategies and pro-
cesses that contribute to financial performance of the firm.

<p>CONCLUSION
This chapter&mdash;as well as this book&mdash;presents purchasing and supply chain manage-
</p>
<p>ment as a dynamic field of study. Surviving in an era of rapid change and intense com-
petition requires a commitment to (1) develop the skills of purchasing professionals,
(2) actively use information technology across the supply chain, (3) pursue activities
and practices that capture the full benefit of a world-class supply base, (4) create re-
sponsive new organizational structures, and (5) establish the most effective purchas-
ing and supply chain measurement system. Competing today requires purchasing
and supply chain managers to play an active role in helping achieve an organization&rsquo;s
cost, quality, time, technology, innovation, and sustainability goals&mdash;or risk losing
market share to competitors that are benefiting from world-class supply chain
management.
</p>

<p>1 Avion, Inc.
Susan Dey and Bill Mifflin, procurement managers at Avion, Inc., sat across from
</p>
<p>each other and reviewed a troubling performance report concerning a key supplier,
Foster Technologies. The report detailed the deteriorating performance of Foster
Technologies in the areas of material quality and on-time delivery.
</p>
<p>Susan: I don&rsquo;t believe what I am seeing. This supplier was clearly a star when we
performed our supplier visits before awarding the contract for the new
Amrod product line.
</p>
<p>Bill: I&rsquo;m not pleased. I was on the team that performed the audit and site visit.
Foster&rsquo;s management was so smooth&mdash;they indicated they could meet all
our requirements. I feel like we&rsquo;ve been misled by this supplier.
</p>
<p>Susan: Didn&rsquo;t you look at their processes and quality systems?
</p>
<p>Bill: Sure we did. Everything checked out fine. But now every other shipment
has some problem, and the delays are hurting our ability to get our product
to our customers. What really struck us about this supplier was how innova-
tive they were. Foster&rsquo;s biggest drawback was their size&mdash;they lacked some
depth at key manufacturing engineering positions. Maybe that&rsquo;s why they
are having problems. It could be that someone has left the company.
</p>
<p>Susan: We are going to have to address these problems quickly.
</p>
<p>Bill: I&rsquo;ll tell you what I am going to recommend. We should begin immediately
to look for another supplier. I never was a fan of these single-source con-
tracts. They leave us open to too much risk.
</p>
<p>Susan: But won&rsquo;t that take a long time?
</p>
<p>Bill: Sure. We&rsquo;ll have to perform another supplier search with team visits. New
tooling could really cost, too. This could take months.
</p>
<p>Susan: Has anyone talked with the supplier about these problems?
</p>
<p>Bill: Kevin went over personally today and talked with the production manager.
He didn&rsquo;t have much time to explain, but he indicated on the phone that
Foster&rsquo;s production manager said we should accept responsibility for a
good part of the problems that are occurring!
</p>
<p>Susan: Why should we? I think they are just trying to shift the blame for their
poor performance.
</p>
<p>At this point, Kevin O&rsquo;Donnell, another procurement manager, entered the room.
</p>
<p>Bill: Kevin, glad you&rsquo;re here. We were just discussing how Foster is trying to
blame us for their problems. I think we should dump them fast!
</p>
<p>Kevin: Yeah, well, I&rsquo;ve got news for you two. I think Foster&rsquo;s production manager
is correct. I think I would be frustrated with us, too!

<p>Kevin: I spent a good part of the day over at Foster and learned some interesting
things. For example, do either of you remember what we told Foster the
monthly volume requirements for the product would be?
</p>
<p>Bill: I remember exactly. The volumes were projected to be 2,500 units a month.
So what&rsquo;s the problem?
</p>
<p>Kevin: We need to talk with our production group more often. The monthly vol-
umes are now over 4,000 units a month! And not only that, our production
group now wants material within 10 days of a material release rather than
two weeks. We have also been changing the final material release quantities
right up to the last minute before delivery.
</p>
<p>Bill: Uh oh. I remember on our site visit that the most their production system
could handle was 3,500 units a month. And a two-week lead time was
about as low as they could go.
</p>
<p>Susan: But why didn&rsquo;t they inform us that these changes were causing problems?
They still have some explaining to do.
</p>
<p>Kevin: Apparently they tried. What did your team tell this supplier about commu-
nicating with us after you finished negotiating the contract?
</p>
<p>Bill: We said that any operational problems or issues have to go through our
materials management people. The team was responsible for evaluating and
selecting the supplier, and then negotiating the agreement.
</p>
<p>Kevin: Foster&rsquo;s production manager produced a log detailing seven memos and let-
ters outlining the impact of our production and scheduling changes on
their operation. He also called us several times with no response. Each of
these inquiries received little attention on the part of our materials group.
I&rsquo;m not sure how fond Foster is of us as a customer. I think they are anx-
ious for this contract to wind down so they can dump us!
</p>
<p>Susan: What do we do now?

the automotive market, has sent out requests for quotations for a wiring harness to
four prospective suppliers. Only two of the four suppliers indicated an interest in
quoting the business: Original Wire (Auburn Hills, MI) and Happy Lucky Assem-
blies (HLA) of Guangdong Province, China. The estimated demand for the harnesses
is 5,000 units a month. Both suppliers will incur some costs to retool for this particu-
lar harness. The harnesses will be prepackaged in 24 &times; 12 &times; 6-inch cartons. Each pack-
aged unit weighs approximately 10 pounds.
</p>
<p>Quote 1
The first quote received is from Original Wire. Auburn Hills is about 20 miles
</p>
<p>from Autolink&rsquo;s corporate headquarters, so the quote was delivered in person. When
Sheila went down to the lobby, she was greeted by the sales agent and an engineering
representative. After the quote was handed over, the sales agent noted that engineer-
ing would be happy to work closely with Autolink in developing the unit and would
also be interested in future business that might involve finding ways to reduce costs.
The sales agent also noted that they were hungry for business, as they were losing a
lot of customers to companies from China. The quote included unit price, tooling,
and packaging. The quoted unit price does not include shipping costs. Original Wire
requires no special warehousing of inventory, and daily deliveries from its manufactur-
ing site directly to Autolink&rsquo;s assembly operations are possible.
</p>
<p>Original Wire Quote:
</p>
<p>&bull; Unit price = $30
</p>
<p>&bull; Packing costs = $0.75 per unit
</p>
<p>&bull; Tooling = $6,000 one-time fixed charge
</p>
<p>&bull; Freight cost = $5.20 per hundred pounds
</p>
<p>Quote 2
The second quote received is from Happy Lucky Assemblies of Guangdong Prov-
</p>
<p>ince, China. The supplier must pack the harnesses in a container and ship via inland
transportation to the port of Shanghai in China, have the shipment transferred to a
container ship, ship material to Seattle, and then have material transported inland to
Detroit. The quoted unit price does not include international shipping costs, which
the buyer will assume.
</p>
<p>HLA Quote:
</p>
<p>&bull; Unit price = $19.50
</p>
<p>&bull; Shipping lead time = Eight weeks
</p>
<p>&bull; Tooling = $3,000

<p>In addition to the supplier&rsquo;s quote, Sheila must consider additional costs and informa-
tion before preparing a comparison of the Chinese supplier&rsquo;s quotation:
</p>
<p>&bull; Each monthly shipment requires three 40-foot containers.
</p>
<p>&bull; Packing costs for containerization = $2 per unit.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost of inland transportation to port of export = $200 per container.
</p>
<p>&bull; Freight forwarder&rsquo;s fee = $100 per shipment (letter of credit, documentation,
etc.).
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost of ocean transport = $4,000 per container. This has risen significantly
in recent years due to a shortage of ocean freight capacity.
</p>
<p>&bull; Marine insurance = $0.50 per $100 of shipment.
</p>
<p>&bull; U.S. port handling charges = $1,200 per container. This fee has also risen
considerably this year, due to increased security. Ports have also been com-
plaining that the charges may increase in the future.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customs duty = 5% of unit cost.
</p>
<p>&bull; Customs broker fees per shipment = $300.
</p>
<p>&bull; Transportation from Seattle to Detroit = $18.60 per hundred pounds.
</p>
<p>&bull; Need to warehouse at least four weeks of inventory in Detroit at a ware-
housing cost of $1.00 per cubic foot per month, to compensate for lead time
uncertainty.
</p>
<p>Sheila must also figure the costs associated with committing corporate capital for hold-
ing inventory. She has spoken to some accountants, who typically use a corporate
cost of capital rate of 15%.
</p>
<p>&bull; Cost of hedging currency&mdash;broker fees = $400 per shipment
</p>
<p>&bull; Additional administrative time due to international shipping = 4 hours per
shipment &times; $25 per hour (estimated)
</p>
<p>&bull; At least two five-day visits per year to travel to China to meet with supplier
and provide updates on performance and shipping = $20,000 per year
(estimated)
</p>
<p>The additional costs associated with international purchasing are estimated but are
nevertheless present. If Sheila does not assume these costs directly, then both sup-
pliers have agreed to either pay them and invoice Sheila later, or build the costs into
a revised unit price. Sheila feels that the U.S. supplier is probably less expensive, even
though it quoted a higher price. Sheila also knows that this is a standard technol-
ogy that is unlikely to change during the next three years, but which could be a con-
tract that extends multiple years out. There is also a lot of &ldquo;hall talk&rdquo; amongst the
engineers on her floor about next-generation automotive electronics, which will
completely eliminate the need for wire harnesses, which will be replaced by electronic
components that are smaller, lighter, and more reliable. She is unsure about how to
calculate the total costs for each option, and she is even more unsure about how to
factor these other variables into the decision.

<p>3 Managing Supplier Qual i ty:
Integrated Devices
</p>
<p>Bill Edwards is a quality engineer assigned to the Injected Molding Commodity
Team at Integrated Devices. The commodity team is responsible for evaluating, select-
ing, and negotiating agreements with plastic-injected molding suppliers to be used
throughout Integrated Devices. The team is also responsible for improving service
quality and material that Integrated Devices receives from its suppliers. Bill&rsquo;s role
after supplier selection involves working directly with suppliers that require training
or technical assistance concerning quality control and quality improvement.
</p>
<p>The company spends about 70% of each sales dollar on purchased goods and ser-
vices, so suppliers have a major impact on product quality.
</p>
<p>Bill just received a call concerning a recurring manufacturing problem at Inte-
grated Devices&rsquo; Plant No. 3. The plant buyer said the plant is experiencing some qual-
ity variability problems with a key plastic-injected molding component supplied by
Trexler Plastics. The component is sometimes too short or too long to fit properly
with other components within the finished product. On occasion, the bracket snaps,
causing end-product failure. Although the unit cost of the plastic-injected molding
component is only $1.55, these quality issues (length variability and snapping) are cre-
ating production problems that far exceed the component&rsquo;s purchase price.
</p>
<p>The local buyer announced he was having difficulty resolving the problem and
asked for support from the corporate commodity team. The buyer said, &ldquo;You corpo-
rate guys selected this supplier that we all have to use. The least you can do is to
help us out of the jam your supplier choice is causing.&rdquo; The buyer&rsquo;s comment sur-
prised Bill, although Bill would soon come to understand that plant personnel re-
sented not being able to select their own suppliers.
</p>
<p>After investigating the problem during a tension-filled meeting with Plant No. 3
personnel, Bill determined he would have to visit the supplier directly. He would
work with Trexler&rsquo;s process engineers to address the manufacturing variability caused
by the nonconforming component. Bill went back and reviewed his team&rsquo;s actions
when selecting a single supplier to provide an entire family of plastic-injected
moldings.
</p>
<p>Trexler had quoted the lowest price of all competing suppliers and had provided
samples that passed Integrated Devices&rsquo; engineering tests.
</p>
<p>Upon his arrival at the supplier, Bill learned that Trexler did not have a dedicated
process engineer. One engineer, Steve Smith, was responsible for plant layout, pro-
cess, quality, and industrial engineering. This individual, who was hired only two
months previously, was still becoming familiar with Trexler&rsquo;s procedures. When Bill
asked to review the supplier&rsquo;s quality control procedures, Steve had to ask several peo-
ple before he could locate Trexler&rsquo;s procedures manual.
</p>
<p>Bill decided that his first step should be to understand the process responsible for
producing the defective component. At an afternoon meeting, Bill asked Steve for ac-
tual output data from Trexler&rsquo;s process. Steve explained they did not collect data for

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>process capability studies or for statistical control charting of continuous production.
However, he did say that sometimes, &ldquo;things don&rsquo;t seem to be operating well&rdquo; with
the equipment that produces the component. Trexler uses an inspector to examine
every finished item to determine if it should be shipped to the customer.
</p>
<p>After explaining the basics of process capability to Steve, Bill asked him to collect
data from the process that produced the bracket component. Bill requested that Steve
take exact measurements periodically from the process so they could draw statistical
conclusions. Bill said he would return in three days to examine the data.
</p>
<p>Upon his return three days later, Steve shared with Bill the details of the data col-
lection effort (see Exhibit 1).
</p>
<p>Component: #03217666
</p>
<p>Description: Bracket
</p>
<p>Design specification: 4 &plusmn; 0.06 inches
</p>
<p>Once Bill calculated a preliminary process capability from this data and examined
the training and quality control procedures at Trexler, he realized he had some seri-
ous work ahead of him.
</p>
<p>ASSIGNMENT
1. Calculate the Cp and Cpk of the process that produces the component purchased
by Integrated Devices. Remember&mdash;Process width = 6 times the standard devia-
tion of the sample. Can the process at Trexler satisfy design requirements? What
should be a target Cpk level?
</p>
<p>2. Why is it important to prove that a process is proven capable before developing
statistical control limits (i.e., SPC charts)?
</p>
<p>3. Is Integrated Devices being reactive or proactive when it comes to managing sup-
plier quality? Why?
</p>
<p>4. Discuss the possible advantages of negotiating quality requirements directly into
supplier contracts.
</p>
<p>5. What is the risk of relying on product samples when selecting suppliers? What is
the risk of relying too heavily on unit cost when making the selection decision?
</p>
<p>6. Why was it so important for Bill to work with Plant No. 3 personnel before visit-
ing Trexler?

<p>4 Negotiat ion&mdash;Porto
Due to competitive pressures, firms in the computer industry are constantly look-
</p>
<p>ing to reduce costs. Computer manufacturers compete fiercely for contracts based on
meeting the technology, quality, and price requirements of customers. Profit margins
and return-on-investment targets are almost always under pressure. Dell Computer
recently saw its operating margins slip to a slim 7%.
</p>
<p>Most computer manufacturers have programs designed to improve quality and
reduce the costs associated with their products. One strategy that many producers use
is to contract only with high-quality suppliers and develop longer-term buyer-seller re-
lationships. One major computer company, Porto, also initiated a program requesting
suppliers to continually improve productivity, which should lead to cost reductions.
</p>
<p>The objective of the program was to reduce purchase costs over the foreseeable
future. Porto also expects its suppliers to contribute cost-saving ideas whenever
possible.
</p>
<p>The high-technology industry features high fixed costs due to large investments in
plant and equipment. These companies also commit large expenditures to research
and development.
</p>
<p>Porto currently has a requirement for an electronic component termed &ldquo;New
Prod,&rdquo; which is part of a recently designed product. The estimated volume require-
ment of New Prod is 200,000 units with additional follow-on orders likely. For the
New Prod component, Porto felt there were five to eight highly competitive suppliers
capable of producing the item. These suppliers are located primarily along the East
and West Coasts of the United States. After a request for quote and preliminary analy-
sis, the buyer for Porto decided to pursue further discussions with Technotronics.
</p>
<p>Negotiation Session Requirements
Each negotiator must plan and prepare before conducting the negotiation. The
</p>
<p>group leader has information packets for the buyer and the seller that provide addi-
tional information and assignments required for conducting the negotiation. Buyers
and sellers can share as little or as much of the information with each other as they
desire during the actual negotiation.
</p>
<p>Your negotiation strategy should be developed prior to the negotiation session. If
working in groups, all group members should participate in the research planning as
well as the actual negotiation. Remember, price is not the only variable subject to
negotiation. In highly volatile industries like the computer industry, for example,
capacity guarantees from suppliers are often critical. Be creative when crafting your
purchase agreement.

<p>5 Purchasing Ethics
</p>
<p>Scenario 1
Bryan Janz was just arriving back from lunch when his office phone rang. It was
</p>
<p>his wife, Nina, calling from home. Nina told Bryan that FedEx had just delivered a
package addressed to her. The package contained a beautiful clock, now sitting over
the fireplace. In fact, Nina said, &ldquo;the clock looks absolutely beautiful on our living
room fireplace.&rdquo; Thinking the clock was from a family member, Bryan asked who
sent the present. She said she did not recognize the name&mdash;the clock was from
Mr. James McEnroe. Bryan immediately told Nina that she had to repack the clock be-
cause it was from a supplier who had been trying to win business from Bryan&rsquo;s com-
pany. They definitely could not accept the clock. Nina was very upset and responded
that the clock was perfect for the room and, besides, the clock came to their home,
not to Bryan&rsquo;s office. Because of Nina&rsquo;s attachment to the clock, Bryan was unsure
about what to do.
</p>
<p>ASSIGNMENT
1. What should Bryan do about the clock?
</p>
<p>2. What does the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) code of ethics say about ac-
cepting supplier favors and gifts?
</p>
<p>3. Why do you think the supplier sent the clock to Bryan&rsquo;s home and addressed it
to his wife?
</p>
<p>4. Does the mere act of sending the clock to Bryan mean that Mr. McEnroe is an un-
ethical salesperson?

<p>Scenario 2
Lisa Jennings thought that at long last, her company, Assurance Technologies, was
</p>
<p>about to win a major contract from Sealgood Instruments. Sealgood, a maker of preci-
sion measuring instruments, was sourcing a large contract for component sub-
assemblies. The contract that Assurance Technologies was bidding on was worth at
least $2.5 million annually, a significant amount given Assurance&rsquo;s annual sales of
$30 million. Her team had spent hundreds of hours preparing the quotation and felt
they could meet Sealgood&rsquo;s requirements in quality, cost, delivery, part standardiza-
tion, and simplification. In fact, Lisa had never been more confident about a quote
meeting the demanding requirements of a potential customer.
</p>
<p>Troy Smyrna, the buyer at Sealgood Instruments responsible for awarding this con-
tract, called Lisa and asked to meet with her at his office to discuss the specifics ofS

<p>the contract. When she arrived, Lisa soon realized that the conversation was not go-
ing exactly as she had expected. Troy informed Lisa that Assurance Technologies had
indeed prepared a solid quotation for the contract. However, when he visited Assur-
ance&rsquo;s facility earlier on a prequalifying visit, he was disturbed to see a significant
amount of a competitor&rsquo;s product being used by Assurance. Troy explained his uneasi-
ness with releasing part plans and designs to a company that clearly had involvement
with a competitor. When Lisa asked what Assurance could do to minimize his uneasi-
ness, Troy replied that he would be more comfortable if Assurance no longer used
the competitor&rsquo;s equipment and used Sealgood&rsquo;s equipment instead. Lisa responded
that this would mean replacing several hundred thousand dollars worth of equip-
ment. Unfazed, Troy simply asked her whether or not she wanted the business. Lisa
responded that she needed some time to think and that she would get back to Troy
in a day or so.

1. Do you think the buyer at Sealgood Instruments, Troy Smyrna, is practicing un-
ethical behavior? First, what is the term for this behavior, and defend why you
think it is ethical or unethical behavior.

<p>Scenario 3
Ben Gibson, the purchasing manager at Coastal Products, was reviewing purchas-
</p>
<p>ing expenditures for packaging materials with Jeff Joyner. Ben was particularly dis-
turbed about the amount spent on corrugated boxes purchased from Southeastern
Corrugated. Ben said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the salesman from that company. He comes
around here acting like he owns the place. He loves to tell us about his fancy car,
house, and vacations. It seems to me he must be making too much money off of us!&rdquo;
Jeff responded that he heard Southeastern Corrugated was going to ask for a price in-
crease to cover the rising costs of raw material paper stock. Jeff further stated that
Southeastern would probably ask for more than what was justified simply from rising
paper stock costs.
</p>
<p>After the meeting, Ben decided he had heard enough. After all, he prided himself
on being a results-oriented manager. There was no way he was going to allow that
salesman to keep taking advantage of Coastal Products. Ben called Jeff and told him
it was time to rebid the corrugated contract before Southeastern came in with a price
increase request. Who did Jeff know that might be interested in the business? Jeff re-
plied he had several companies in mind to include in the bidding process. These
companies would surely come in at a lower price, partly because they used lower-
grade boxes that would probably work well enough in Coastal Products&rsquo; process. Jeff
also explained that these suppliers were not serious contenders for the business.
Their purpose was to create competition with the bids. Ben told Jeff to make sure
that Southeastern was well aware that these new suppliers were bidding on the con-
tract. He also said to make sure the suppliers knew that price was going to be the de-
termining factor in this quote, because he considered corrugated boxes to be a
standard industry item. S

<p>Scenario 4
Sharon Gillespie, a new buyer at Visionex, Inc., was reviewing quotations for a tool-
</p>
<p>ing contract submitted by four suppliers. She was evaluating the quotes based on
price, target quality levels, and delivery lead time promises. As she was working, her
manager, Dave Cox, entered her office. He asked how everything was progressing
and if she needed any help. She mentioned she was reviewing quotations from suppli-
ers for a tooling contract. Dave asked who the interested suppliers were and if she
had made a decision. Sharon indicated that one supplier, Apex, appeared to fit ex-
actly the requirements Visionex had specified in the proposal. Dave told her to keep
up the good work.
</p>
<p>Later that day Dave again visited Sharon&rsquo;s office. He stated that he had done some
research on the suppliers and felt that another supplier, Micron, appeared to have
the best track record with Visionex. He pointed out that Sharon&rsquo;s first choice was a
new supplier to Visionex and there was some risk involved with that choice. Dave in-
dicated that it would please him greatly if she selected Micron for the contract.
</p>
<p>The next day Sharon was having lunch with another buyer, Mark Smith. She men-
tioned the conversation with Dave and said she honestly felt that Apex was the best
choice. When Mark asked Sharon who Dave preferred, she answered, &ldquo;Micron.&rdquo; At
that point Mark rolled his eyes and shook his head. Sharon asked what the body lan-
guage was all about. Mark replied, &ldquo;Look, I know you&rsquo;re new but you should know
this. I heard last week that Dave&rsquo;s brother-in-law is a new part owner of Micron. I
was wondering how soon it would be before he started steering business to that com-
pany. He is not the straightest character.&rdquo; Sharon was shocked. After a few moments,
she announced that her original choice was still the best selection. At that point
Mark reminded Sharon that she was replacing a terminated buyer who did not go
along with one of Dave&rsquo;s previous preferred suppliers.

<p>6 Insourcing/Outsourcing:
The FlexCon Piston Decision
</p>
<p>This case addresses many issues that affect insourcing/outsourcing decisions. A
complex and important topic facing businesses today is whether to produce a compo-
nent, assembly, or service internally (insourcing) or purchase that same component,
assembly, or service from an external supplier (outsourcing).
</p>
<p>Because of the important relationship between insourcing/outsourcing and compet-
itiveness, organizations must consider many variables when considering an insour-
cing/outsourcing decision. This may include a detailed examination of a firm&rsquo;s
competency and costs, along with quality, delivery, technology, responsiveness, and
continuous improvement requirements. Because of the critical nature of many insour-
cing/outsourcing decisions, cross-functional teams often assume responsibility for
managing the decision-making process. A single functional group usually does not
have the data, insight, or knowledge required to make effective strategic insourcing/
outsourcing decisions.
</p>
<p>FlexCon&rsquo;s Insourcing/Outsourcing of Pistons
FlexCon, a $3 billion maker of small industrial engines, is undergoing a major in-
</p>
<p>ternal review to decide where the company should focus its product development ef-
forts and strategic investment. Executive management is arguing that too much
capacity and talent are being committed to producing simple, commodity-type items
that provide small differentiation within the marketplace. FlexCon concluded that in
its attempts to preserve jobs, it has insourced parts that are easy to manufacture,
while outsourcing those that are complex or challenging. Producing commodity-like
components with mature technologies is adding little to what FlexCon&rsquo;s customers
consider important. The company has become increasingly dependent on suppliers
for critical components and subassemblies that make a major difference in the perfor-
mance and cost of finished products.
</p>
<p>Part of FlexCon&rsquo;s effort at redefining itself involves creating an understanding of in-
sourcing/outsourcing among managers and employees. The company has sponsored
workshops and presentations to convey executive management&rsquo;s vision and goals, in-
cluding educating those who are directly involved in making detailed insourcing/out-
sourcing recommendations.
</p>
<p>One presentation given by an expert in strategic sourcing focused on the changes
in the marketplace that are encouraging outsourcing. The expert noted six key trends
and changes that influence insourcing/outsourcing decisions:
</p>
<p>1. The pressure for cost reduction is severe and will continue to increase. Cost re-
duction pressures are forcing organizations to use their production resources
more efficiently. A recent study found that over 70% of firms surveyed expect
stable or increasing purchased material costs through 2010. As a result,

<p>executive management will increasingly rely on insourcing/outsourcing deci-
sions as a way to manage costs.
</p>
<p>2. Firms are continuing to become more highly specialized in product and process
technology. Increased specialization implies focused investment in a process or
technology, which contributes to greater cost differentials between firms.
</p>
<p>3. Firms will increasingly focus on what they excel at while outsourcing areas of
nonexpertise. Some organizations are formally defining their core competen-
cies to help guide the insourcing/outsourcing effort. This has affected deci-
sions concerning what businesses a firm should engage.
</p>
<p>4. The need for responsiveness in the marketplace is increasingly affecting insour-
cing/outsourcing decisions. Shorter cycle times, for example, encourage greater
outsourcing with less vertical integration. The time to develop a production ca-
pability or capacity may exceed the window available to enter a new market.
</p>
<p>5. Wall Street recognizes and rewards firms with higher ROI/ROA. Because insour-
cing usually requires an assumption of fixed assets (and increased human capi-
tal), financial pressures are causing managers to closely examine sourcing
decisions. Avoidance of fixed costs and assets is motivating many firms to
rely on supplier assets.
</p>
<p>6. Improved computer simulation tools and forecasting software enable firms to
perform insourcing/outsourcing comparisons with greater precision. These tools
allow the user to perform sensitivity analysis (what-if analysis) that permits
comparison of different sourcing possibilities.
</p>
<p>One topic that interested FlexCon managers was a discussion of how core compe-
tencies relate to outsourcing decisions. FlexCon management commonly accepted
that a core competency was something the company &ldquo;was good at.&rdquo; This view, how-
ever, is not correct. A core competency refers to skills, processes, or resources that dis-
tinguish a company, are hard to duplicate, and make that firm unique compared to
other firms. Core competencies begin to define a firm&rsquo;s long-run, strategic ability to
build a dominant set of technologies or skills that enable it to adapt quickly to chang-
ing market opportunities. The presenter argued that three key points relate to the
idea of core competence and its relationship to insourcing/outsourcing decisions:
</p>
<p>1. A firm should concentrate internally on those components, assemblies, sys-
tems, or services that are critical to the finished product and where the firm
possesses a distinctive (i.e., unique) advantage valued by the customer.
</p>
<p>2. Consider outsourcing components, assemblies, systems, or services when sup-
pliers have an advantage. Supplier advantages may occur because of econo-
mies of scale, process-specific investment, higher quality, familiarity with a
technology, or a favorable cost structure.
</p>
<p>3. Recognize that once a firm outsources an item or service, it usually loses the
ability to bring that production capability or technology in-house without com-
mitting a significant investment.
</p>
<p>The manager or team responsible for making an insourcing/outsourcing decision
must develop a true sense of what the core competency of the organization is and
whether the product or service under consideration is an integral part of that core
competency.
</p>
<p>The workshops and presentations have given most participants a greater apprecia-
tion of the need to consider factors besides cost when assessing insourcing/

<p>outsourcing opportunities. One breakout work session focused exclusively on develop-
ing a list of the key factors that may affect the insourcing/outsourcing analysis at Flex-
Con, which appears in Exhibit 1.
</p>
<p>The Piston Insourcing/Outsourcing Decision
FlexCon is considering outsourcing production of all pistons that are part of the
</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s &ldquo;R&rdquo; series of engines. FlexCon has machined various versions of these pis-
tons for as long as anyone at the company can remember. In fact, the company star-
ted fifty years ago as a producer of high-quality pistons. The company grew as
customers requested that FlexCon produce a broader line of products. This out-
sourcing analysis has generated a great deal of interest and emotion among FlexCon
engineers, managers, and employees.
</p>
<p>FlexCon produces pistons in three separate work cells, which differ according to
the type of piston produced. Each cell has six numerically controlled machines in a
U-shape layout, with a supervisor, a process engineer, a material handler, and 12 em-
ployees assigned across the three cells. Employees, who are cross-trained to perform
each job within their cell, work in teams of four. FlexCon experienced a 30% gain in
quality and a 20% gain in productivity after shifting from a process layout, where
equipment was grouped by similar capabilities, to work cells, where equipment was
grouped to support a specific family of products. If FlexCon decides to outsource the
pistons, the company will likely dedicate the floor space currently occupied by the
work cells to a new product or expansion of an existing product. FlexCon will apply
the work cell equipment for other applications, so the outsourcing analysis will not
consider equipment write-offs beyond normal depreciation.
</p>
<p>Although there are different opinions regarding outsourcing the pistons, FlexCon
engineers agreed that the process technology used to produce this family of compo-
nents is mature. Gaining future competitive advantages from new technology was
probably not as great as other process applications within FlexCon&rsquo;s production pro-
cess. This did not mean, however, that FlexCon could avoid making new investments
</p>
<p>Exhibit 1 Key Factors Supporting Insourcing/Outsourcing Decisions
</p>
<p>FACTORS SUPPORT INSOURCING: FACTORS SUPPORT OUTSOURCING:
</p>
<p>1. Cost considerations favor the buyer. 1. Cost considerations favor the supplier.
2. A need or desire exists to integrate internal plant
operations.
</p>
<p>2. Supplier has specialized research and know-how, which creates
differentials in cost and quality.
</p>
<p>3. Excess plant capacity is available that can absorb fixed overhead. 3. Buying firm lacks the technical ability to build an item.
4. A need exists to exert direct control over production and quality. 4. Buyer has small volume requirements.
5. Product design secrecy is an important issue. 5. Buying firm has capacity constraints while the seller does not.
6. A lack of reliable suppliers characterizes the supply market. 6. Buyer does not want to add permanent workers.
7. Firm desires to maintain a stable workforce in a declining
market.
</p>
<p>7. Future volume requirements are uncertain&mdash;buyer wants to
transfer risk to the supplier.
</p>
<p>8. Item or service is directly part of a firm&rsquo;s core competency, or links
directly to the strategic plans of the organization.
</p>
<p>8. Item or service is routine and available from many competitive
sources.
</p>
<p>9. Item or technology behind making the item is strategic to the firm.
The item adds to the qualities customers consider important.
</p>
<p>9. Short cycle time requirements discourage new investment by the
buyer&mdash;using existing supplier assets is logical.
</p>
<p>10. Union or other restrictions discourage or even prohibit outsourcing. 10. Adding capacity at the buyer requires high capital start-up costs.
11. Outsourcing may create or encourage a new competitor. 11. Process technology is mature with minimal likelihood of providing
</p>
<p>a future competitive advantage to the purchaser.

innovation is not possible.
</p>
<p>Differences over outsourcing a component that is critical to the performance of
FlexCon&rsquo;s final product threatens to affect the insourcing/outsourcing decision. One
engineer threatened to quit if FlexCon outsourced a component that could &ldquo;bring
down&rdquo; the entire engine in case of quality failure. He also maintained, &ldquo;Our pistons
are known in the industry as first-rate.&rdquo; Another engineer suggested that FlexCon&rsquo;s
supply management group, if given support from the engineers, could adequately
manage any risk of poor supplier quality. However, a third engineer noted, &ldquo;Opportu-
nistic suppliers will exploit FlexCon if given the chance&mdash;we&rsquo;ve seen it before!&rdquo; This
engineer warned the group about suppliers &ldquo;buying in&rdquo; to the piston business only to
coercively raise prices. Several experienced engineers voiced the opinion that they
could not imagine FlexCon outsourcing a component that was responsible for mak-
ing FlexCon the company it is today. Several newer members of the engineering
group suggested they should wait until the outsourcing cost analysis was complete be-
fore rendering final judgment.
</p>
<p>Management has created a cross-functional team composed of a process engineer,
a cost analyst, a quality engineer, a procurement specialist, a supervisor, and a ma-
chine cell employee to conduct the outsourcing analysis. A major issue confronting
this team involves determining which internal costs to apply to the analysis. Includ-
ing total variable costs is straightforward because these costs are readily identifiable
and vary directly with production levels. Examples of variable costs include materials,
direct labor, and transportation.
</p>
<p>The team is struggling with whether (or at what level) to include total factory and
administrative costs (i.e., fixed costs and the fixed portion of semivariable costs). Fac-
tory and administrative costs include utilities, indirect labor, process engineering sup-
port, depreciation, corporate office administration, maintenance, and product design
charges. Proper allocation of overhead is a difficult, and sometimes subjective, task.
The assumptions the team makes about how to allocate total factory and operating
costs can dramatically alter the results of the analysis.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The aggregated volume for pistons over the next several years is critical to this anal-
ysis. Exhibit 2 provides a monthly forecast of expected piston volumes over the next
two years. Total forecasted volume is 300,000 units in Year 1 and 345,000 units in
Year 2. The team arrived at the forecast by determining the forecast for FlexCon &ldquo;R&rdquo;
series engines, which is an independent demand item. Pistons are a dependent de-
mand item (i.e., dependent on the demand for the final product).
</p>
<p>Although this is a long-term decision likely to extend beyond ten years, the team
has confidence in its projections (including supplier pricing) only through two years.
Although maintaining piston production internally would require some level of pro-
cess investment in Years 3 through 10, the team believes any projections past Year 2
contain too much uncertainty. (Conducting a net present value for expected savings
from outsourcing, if they exist, is beyond the scope of this assignment.)
</p>
<p>Insourcing Costs
The team has decided that a comprehensive total cost analysis should include all di-
</p>
<p>rect and indirect costs incurred to support piston production. FlexCon tracks its mate-
rials and labor by completing production worksheets for each job. The team collected
data for the previous year, which revealed that the three work cells produced 288,369
pistons.
</p>
<p>Direct Materials
FlexCon machines the pistons from a semifinished steel alloy purchased directly
</p>
<p>from a steel foundry. The foundry ships the alloy to FlexCon in 50 lb. blocks, which
cost $195 per block. Each piston requires, on average, 1.1 lb. of semifinished raw mate-
rial for each finished piston. This figure includes scrap and waste.
</p>
<p>The team expects the semifinished raw material price to remain constant over the
next two years. Although FlexCon expects greater piston volumes in Years 1 and 2
compared with current demand, the team does not believe additional material econo-
mies are available.
</p>
<p>FlexCon spent $225,000 last year on other miscellaneous direct materials required
to produce the pistons. The team expects to use this figure as a basis for calculating ex-
pected Year 1 and 2 costs for miscellaneous direct material requirements.
</p>
<p>Direct Work Cell Labor
The direct labor in the three work cells worked a total of 27,000 hours last year. To-
</p>
<p>tal payroll for direct labor was $472,500, which includes overtime pay. The average di-
rect labor rate is $17.50 per hour ($472,500 / 27,000 total hours = $17.50 per hour).
As a rule of thumb, the team expects to add 40% to direct labor costs to account for
benefits (health, dental, pension, etc.). The team also expects direct labor rates to in-
crease 3% a year for the next two years. The team does not expect per-hour produc-
tion rates to change significantly. The process is well established, and FlexCon has
already captured any learning curve benefits.
</p>
<p>Work cell employees are responsible for machine setup, so the team decided not
to include machine setup as a separate cost category.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Indirect Work Cell Labor
FlexCon assigns a supervisor, material handler, and engineer full-time to the three
</p>
<p>work cells. Last year, the supervisor earned $52,000, the material handler earned
$37,000, and the engineer earned $63,000 in salary. Again, the team expects to apply
an additional 40% to these figures to reflect fringe benefits. The team expects these sal-
aries to increase 3% each year.
</p>
<p>Factory Overhead and Administrative Costs
This category of costs is, without doubt, the most difficult category of cost to allo-
</p>
<p>cate. For example, should the team prorate part of the plant manager&rsquo;s salary to the
piston work cells? One team member argued that these costs are present with or with-
out piston production and, therefore, should not be part of the insourcing calcula-
tion. Another member maintained that factory overhead supports the factory, and
the three work cells are a major part of the factory. Not including these costs would
distort the insourcing calculation. She noted that the supplier is most assuredly consid-
ering these costs when quoting the piston contract. Another member suggested per-
forming two analyses of insourcing costs. One would include factory overhead and
administrative costs, and the other would exclude these costs.
</p>
<p>The team divided the factory into six &ldquo;zones&rdquo; based on the functions performed
throughout the plant. The piston work cells account for 25% of the factory&rsquo;s floor
space, 28% of total direct labor hours, and 23% of plant volume. From this analysis,
the team has decided to allocate 25% of the factory&rsquo;s overhead and administrative
costs to the piston work cells for the analysis that includes these costs. Exhibit 3 pre-
sents relevant cost data for the previous year. The team expects these costs to in-
crease 3% each year.
</p>
<p>Preventive Maintenance Costs
FlexCon spent $40,250 on preventive maintenance activities on the 18 machines
</p>
<p>in the three cells last year and expects this to increase by 10% in each of the next
two years (due to the increasing age of the equipment).
</p>
<p>Machine Repair Costs
An examination of maintenance work orders reveals that the 18 work cell machines,
</p>
<p>which are each five to seven years old, required total unplanned repair expenses of
$37,000 last year. The maintenance supervisor expects this figure to increase by 8% in
Year 1 and 12% in Year 2 of the analysis due to increasing age and volumes.

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Ordering Costs
Although FlexCon produces pistons in-house, the company still incurs ordering
</p>
<p>costs for direct materials. The team estimates that each monthly order to the foundry
and other suppliers costs FlexCon $1,500 in direct and transaction-related costs.
</p>
<p>Semifinished Raw Material Inventory Carrying Costs
FlexCon typically maintains one month of semifinished raw material inventory as
</p>
<p>safety and buffer stock. The carrying charge assigned to this inventory is 18% annually.
</p>
<p>Inbound Transportation
FlexCon receives a monthly shipment of semifinished alloy that the work cells use
</p>
<p>to machine the pistons. Total transportation costs for the previous year amounted to
$31,500 (which resulted in 288,369 pistons produced).
</p>
<p>The team expects transportation charges for other direct materials used in produc-
tion to be $0.01 per unit in Years 1 and 2 of the analysis.
</p>
<p>Consumable Tooling Costs
The machines in the work cell are notorious for &ldquo;going through tooling.&rdquo; Given
</p>
<p>the consumable tooling costs realized during the previous year, the team estimates ad-
ditional tooling expenses of $56,000 in Year 1, and $65,000 in Year 2.
</p>
<p>Depreciation
The team has decided to include in its cost calculation normal depreciation ex-
</p>
<p>penses for the 18 work cell machines. The depreciation expense for the equipment is
$150,000 per year.
</p>
<p>Finished Piston Carrying Costs
Because FlexCon coordinates the production of pistons with the production of &ldquo;R&rdquo;
</p>
<p>series engines, any inventory carrying charges for finished pistons are part of the cost
of the finished engine and are not considered relevant to this calculation.
</p>
<p>Opportunity Costs
The team recognizes that opportunities may exist for achieving a better return on the
</p>
<p>space and equipment committed to piston production. Unfortunately, the team does
not know with any certainty what management&rsquo;s plans may be for the floor space or
equipment if FlexCon outsources piston production. The team is confident, however,
that management will find a use for the space. If the facility no longer engages in piston
production, then FlexCon must allocate fixed factory and overhead costs across a lower
base of production. This will increase the average costs of the remaining items produced
in the plant, possibly making them uncompetitive compared with external suppliers.
</p>
<p>Outsourcing Costs
The following provides relevant information collected by the team as it relates to out-
</p>
<p>sourcing the family of pistons to an external supplier. Although it is beyond the scope
of this case, the team has already performed a rigorous assessment of the supply

<p>market and has reached consensus on the external supplier in the event the team re-
commends outsourcing. This was necessary to obtain reliable outsourcing cost data.
</p>
<p>Unit Price
The most obvious cost in an outsourcing analysis is the unit price quoted by the
</p>
<p>supplier. In many respects, outsourcing is an exercise in supplier evaluation and selec-
tion. Insourcing/outsourcing requires the evaluation of several suppliers in depth&mdash;
the internal supplier (FlexCon) and external suppliers (in the marketplace). The sup-
plier that the team favors if FlexCon outsources the pistons quoted an average unit
price of $12.20 per piston (recall that this outsourcing decision involves different pis-
ton part numbers). The team believes that negotiation will occur if FlexCon elects to
outsource, perhaps resulting in a lower quoted price. Because the team does not yet
know the final negotiated price, some members argued that several outsourcing analy-
ses are required to reflect different possible unit prices. Quoted terms are 2/10, net
30. The supplier says it will maintain the negotiated price over the next two years.
</p>
<p>Safety Stock Requirements
If the team decides to outsource, FlexCon will hold physical stock from the sup-
</p>
<p>plier equivalent to one month&rsquo;s average demand. This results in an inventory carry-
ing charge, which the team must calculate and include in the total cost analysis.
Although FlexCon likely will rely on or draw down safety stock levels during the
next two years, for purposes of costing the inventory the team has decided not to esti-
mate when this might occur. Inventory carrying charges include working capital com-
mitted to financing the inventory, plus charges for material handling, warehousing,
insurance and taxes, and risk of obsolescence and damage. FlexCon&rsquo;s inventory carry-
ing charge is 18% annually.
</p>
<p>Administrative Support Costs
FlexCon expects to commit the equivalent of one third of a buyer&rsquo;s total time to
</p>
<p>supporting the commercial issues related to the outsourced family of pistons. The
team estimates the buyer&rsquo;s salary at $54,000, with 40% for fringe benefits. The team
expects the buyer&rsquo;s compensation to increase by 3% each year.
</p>
<p>Ordering Costs
The team expects that FlexCon will order monthly, or twelve material releases a
</p>
<p>year. Unfortunately, suppliers in this industry have not been responsive to shipping
on a just-in-time basis or using electronic data interchange. Although FlexCon would
like to pursue a JIT purchasing model, the team feels that assuming lower volume
shipments on a frequently scheduled basis is not appropriate. The company expects
the supplier to deliver one month of inventory at the beginning of each month. The
team estimates the cost to release and receive an order to be $1,500 per order.
</p>
<p>Quality-Related Costs
The team has decided to include quality-related costs in its outsourcing calcula-
</p>
<p>tions. During the investigation of the supplier, a team member collected data on the
process that would likely produce FlexCon&rsquo;s pistons. The team estimates that the sup-
plier&rsquo;s defect level, based on process measurement data, will be 1,500 ppm. FlexCon&rsquo;s

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>quality assurance department estimates that each supplier defect will cost the com-
pany an average of $250 in nonconformance costs.
</p>
<p>Inventory Carrying Charges
FlexCon must assume inventory carrying charges for pistons received at the start
</p>
<p>of each month and then consumed at a steady rate during the month. For purposes
of calculating inventory-carrying costs for finished pistons provided by the supplier,
the team expects to use the average inventory method. The formula for determining
the average number of units in inventory each month is the following:
</p>
<p>&eth;&eth;Beginning Inventory at the Start of Each Month &thorn; Ending Inventory
at the End of Each Month&THORN;=2&THORN; � Carrying Cost per Month
</p>
<p>For calculation purposes, the team assumes that ending inventory each month is zero
units (excluding safety stock, which requires a separate calculation). The team ex-
pects production to use all the pistons received at the beginning of each month. The
carrying charge applied to inventory on an annual basis is 14% of the unit value of
the inventory.1 Appendixes 1 and 2 on pp. 791 and 792 will help in the calculation of
monthly carrying charges associated with holding supplier-provided piston inventory.
</p>
<p>Transportation Charges
Although it is FlexCon&rsquo;s policy to have suppliers ship goods F.O.B. shipping
</p>
<p>point, the company does not accept title or ownership of goods until receipt at the
buyer&rsquo;s dock. However, the company assumes all transportation-related charges. The
team estimates that transportation charges for pistons will average $2,100 per truck-
load, with fourteen truckloads expected in Year 1 and sixteen truckloads expected in
Year 2. The outsourcing supplier is in the United States, which means the team does
not have to consider additional costs related to international purchasing.
</p>
<p>Tooling Charges
The supplier said that new tooling charges to satisfy FlexCon&rsquo;s production require-
</p>
<p>ments would be $300,000. The team has decided to depreciate tooling charges over
two years, or $150,000 per year.

<p>ASSIGNMENT
1. Perform a quantitative insourcing/outsourcing analysis using the data provided.
What qualitative issues might affect your final decision? Identify any costs or is-
sues that are not part of your analysis that might affect your decision. What is
your recommendation regarding what FlexCon should do with its family of pis-
tons? Support your arguments with evidence gathered during your analysis.
</p>
<p>2. Assume your group decided to outsource the pistons to the external supplier. Iden-
tify a plan that would enable FlexCon to carry out this recommendation. Be as
thorough as possible.
</p>
<p>3. Discuss the primary reasons when and why insourcing/outsourcing decisions
occur.
</p>
<p>4. A major challenge with an insourcing/outsourcing analysis involves gathering reli-
able data. Discuss the various groups that should be involved when conducting
an insourcing/outsourcing analysis such as the one presented in this case. What in-
formation can each of these groups provide?
</p>
<p>5. Discuss the major issues associated with an insourcing/outsourcing analysis and
decision.
</p>
<p>ENDNOTES
1. The 14% figure is less than the 18% figure applied to safety stock carrying charges. The
</p>
<p>supplier does not receive payment until at least four weeks after FlexCon receives the pistons.
This makes FlexCon&rsquo;s working capital committed to financing production inventory somewhat
less than the capital committed to financing safety stock.
