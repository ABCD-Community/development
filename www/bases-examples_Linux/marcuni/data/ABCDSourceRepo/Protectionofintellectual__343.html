<p>Foreword 
</p>
<p>In 1992, Papua New Guinea signed the Convention on Biological 
Diversity. When we were planning this seminar in 1997 it became clear 
that many of the requirements for the implementation of the Convention 
had still not been addressed. Many of the issues surrounding the Conven-
tion's implementation-the development of legal and policy frameworks 
for protection of cultural property and indigenous knowledge of medicinal 
resources, rights to the ownership of plant cultivars, the 'fair and equitable 
sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources' 
and measures to 'respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovation 
and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional 
lifestyles that are relevant for conservation and sustainable use of biological 
diversity'-had not been discussed in our own, unique context. It was 
clear that our responses to these issues of global significance needed to 
incorporate specifically Papua New Guinean perspectives. 
</p>
<p>Our greatest concern in stimulating discussion at the seminar was to 
ensure that some of the more fundamental differences between the 
North and the South were discussed and considered before Papua New 
Guinea adopted new intellectual property laws. Intellectual property 
rights regimes are one area in which the priorities and perspectives of the 
North and the South are thrown most starkly into contrast. The 
stimulus for these debates was the adoption in 1995 of the Agreement 
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property under the auspices of 
the World Trade Organisation. This Agreement requires all member 
nations to adopt intellectual property laws within a certain time frame, 
with some leeway provided to developing countries to meet this 
requirement. As a member of the World Trade Organisation, Papua New 
Guinea is required to comply with the Agreement. 
</p>
<p>At the time the seminar was held, Papua New Guinea had just 
become a member of the World Intellectual Property Organisation, and 
the World Trade Organisation and the World Intellectual Property 
Organisation had begun a program of technical cooperation to assist in 
the development of intellectual property laws for Papua New Guinea.

<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>The technical cooperation focused very much on conventional 
intellectual property rights regimes like copyright, patents, plant 
breeders rights and trade secrets, It was clear from the papers and the 
discussion at the seminar that knowledge and ownership are approached 
very differently in Melanesian societies from the way they are handled in 
the jurisdictions of developed countries, and that our own approaches to 
the sharing of ownership and knowledge do not sit easily within a 
western legal framework. 
</p>
<p>In recent months, the debates over free trade and globalisation have 
become a heated issue in the North as well as in the South. Concerns 
range across a wide spectrum of issues, from labour markets to forestry. 
The issues for Papua New Guinea are also varied, but for the most part 
they centre on the question of access to resources-access to biological 
resources and access to the resources of knowledge within our 
communities and villages. Today, Papua New Guinea is just beginning 
to formulate rules about what happens when a bioprospector wishes to 
explore in Papua New Guinea. Legislation covers mining and petroleum 
exploration but there are no laws or rules for engagement with those 
who want to exploit the biological resources of our country. These issues 
are all the more difficult because of our complex land tenure systems, 
communal ownership of resources, and the distribution of ownership of 
biological resources and knowledge across many communities. These 
aspects of Melanesian society need to be carefully considered before we 
simply follow the lead of developed countries and buy into an 
intellectual property rights regime that does not address the issues that 
are important to us. In the development of patent and copyright 
legislation, we should be mindful that the agendas of the developed 
countries who provide us with technical assistance are not necessarily 
aligned with our own priorities. 
</p>
<p>Since the seminar, our own institutions have begun, in a range of 
ways, to explore issues and to try practical approaches. A committee, the 
PNG Bionet, has been established to coordinate government policy. It 
has negotiated a biological exploration agreement with the Australian 
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. A 
similar agreement, described by Lohi Matainaho in his chapter, has been 
negotiated between the University of Papua New Guinea and the US 
National Cancer Institute. These agreements provide for local resource-
owners to be involved. However, we are yet to experience the more

</p>
<p>challenging scenario in which a major discovery is exploited. Such a 
situation is likely to raise real questions about how to equitably distribute 
benefits to the many stakeholders with an interest in a discovery. 
</p>
<p>I am extremely pleased that the seminar at which these issues were 
first discussed in a national forum has served as a springboard for 
subsequent developments. It is to be hoped that the publication of this 
book will serve to stimulate further consideration of these issues that are 
of such serious concern for our future.

Introduction 
</p>
<p>Mark Busse and Kathy Whimp 
</p>
<p>'Lost tribes, lost knowledge' 
In September 1991, the cover of Time magazine featured the portrait of 
a man, identified only as 'Highland Tribesman, Papua New Guinea', 
wearing cuscus fur on his head and a stick through his pierced septum. 
In addition to the question 'Is the CIA Obsolete?' at the top of the page, 
the cover carried the title 'Lost Tribes, Lost Knowledge' and explained 
that 'When native cultures disappear, so does a trove of scientific and 
medical wisdom '. 
</p>
<p>The cover story by Eugene Linden presented a popular view of 
indigenous knowledge, asserting that 'an enormous trove of wisdom' is 
'stored in the memories of elders, healers, midwives, farmers, fishermen 
and hunters in the estimated 15,000 cultures remaining on earth'. For 
Linden, 'This largely undocumented knowledge base is humanity's 
lifeline to a time when people accepted nature's authority and learned 
through trial, error and observation'. 
</p>
<p>According to Time, 'Western contempt' for indigenous knowledge has 
gradually changed to a 'growing appreciation' of the value of indigenous 
knowledge. This change has come about because of a recognition that 
indigenous botanical and medical knowledge can assist in the search for 
plants with chemical properties useful in the treatment of AIDS and 
cancer, that the variety of crops grown by traditional farmers and the 
knowledge they have of those crops is critical for preserving the genetic 
diversity needed to resist insects and diseases, and that in an age of </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>global tourism 'An indigenous culture can itself be a marketable 
commodity if handled with respect and sensitivity'. The recognition of 
the value of indigenous peoples and their knowledge and ways of life, 
according to Linden, is a necessary step 'If the developed world is to 
help indigenous peoples preserve their heritage' (Linden 1991:52-5). 
But 'value' is always value for someone, and in the movement to preserve 
indigenous knowledge the value that matters is most often the 
commercial value of that knowledge for people in industrialised 
countries. 
</p>
<p>Linden explained the loss of indigenous knowledge in terms of the 
inherent glamour and attractiveness of Western ways of life, especially 
for young people, and the destabilising effects of education and money 
which undermine the perceived wisdom and authority of the elders. 
Such an explanation sets up a false dichotomy between tradition and 
modernity, and ignores the colonial histories of most developing 
countries as well as the continuing political and economic inequalities 
between industrialised and non-industrialised countries. The loss of 
indigenous knowledge, according to Time, is the inevitable result of 
individual choice, and saving indigenous knowledge will require the 
assistance of scholars and researchers motivated by the economic value of 
that knowledge for the West. 
</p>
<p>Like the images that accompanied the article, in which people from 
various parts of the world were photographed in front of the same studio 
backdrop, Time presented a decontextualised idea of indigenous 
knowledge in which knowledge can be saved in isolation from the 
cultural and social contexts in which it is produced and used. 1 As 
Linden (1991:52) noted, 'Scientists are learning to look past the myth, 
superstition and ritual that often conceal the hard-won insights of 
indigenous peoples'. The dangers of such an approach have been 
described by Peter Dwyer (1994) in an essay on the use of indigenous 
knowledge by Western conservationists. Dwyer argued that, by 
representing indigenous environmental knowledge as the basis for 
indigenous conservation of the environment, conservationists ignore 
critical differences in underlying assumptions and purposes between 
themselves and indigenous peoples (for example, global vs. local 
concerns). In so doing, conservationists place indigenous people in 
untenable positions. As Dwyer (1994:95) put it, 'In the final analysis 
the elders are acknowledged as wise only in the circumstance that they 
speak as we wish to hear them'.

<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>While unexamined social evolutionary assumptions (assuming that 
contemporary indigenous peoples and their knowledge are somehow a 
link with the past), decontextualised ideas of indigenous knowledge as 
information 'stored' in people's memories, assumptions that indigenous 
peoples are not capable of preserving their own heritage, and the linking 
of preservation to commercial value remain common themes in 
contemporary discussions of indigenous knowledge, what is remarkably 
absent in the Time magazine article, at least from today's perspective, is 
any discussion of intellectual property rights.2 It is hard to imagine that 
a similar article published today could so conspicuously ignore issues of 
property and ownership. This reflects a critical change in the last 
decade, a change that the essays in this book document in the context of 
Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>Protecting intellectual, biological and cultural 
property in Papua New Guinea 
The chapters in this book were presented at a conference on intellectual, 
biological and cultural property that was held in Port Moresby in 
August 1997. They raise issues that are critical both for Papua New 
Guinea and for other developing countries. With the exception of 
Brendan Tobin's chapter (which uses the analysis of an intellectual 
property agreement in the Peruvian Amazon to make general suggestions 
for legal frameworks within which intellectual property can be 
transacted), the essays reflect the Papua New Guinea context in which 
they were written, not only in their content but also in the social and 
historical contexts that are taken for granted-for example, 
understandings about social relations between persons; ideas about 
relationships between persons and things; Papua New Guinea's history 
of British, German and Australian colonialism; and the powerful econ-
omic position that Australia continues to have in Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>The diverse chapters in this book are linked by their concern with the 
concept of property and property rights in intangible things. While they 
emerged from the particularities of Papua New Guinea, the essays also 
take up wider debates at the cutting edge of the development of 
international property law including globalisation and deregulation of 
trade, the balance of economic interests between industrialised and 
developing countries, and the rights of indigenous peoples both 
internationally and in relation to the nation states of which they are 
</p>

</p>
<p>citizens. There is much room for confusion and misunderstanding in 
determining how these questions should be answered. In taking up 
these issues, the essays bring into focus the question of how such 
developments might be applied in Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>In this introduction we seek to provide historical background and to 
illuminate some critical distinctions and perspectives on intellectual 
property which will set the scene for the issues raised in the following 
chapters. We begin with a brief overview of the development of ideas 
about property and intellectual property in English law. The relevance 
of this lies in the Papua New Guinea Constitution which explicitly 
includes both custom and 'the principles and rules of common law and 
equity in England' (as they existed immediately before Papua New 
Guinea's independence in 1975) as the underlying law of the country.3 
We then discuss the major international treaties and conventions 
regarding intellectual property and their significance for Papua New 
Guinea. We then turn to indigenous Papua New Guinean ideas about 
property and intellectual property, and a discussion of the status of 
custom in Papua New Guinea law, before concluding with comments on 
alternatives to the prevailing paradigm of intellectual property rights. 
</p>
<p>Property and property rights 
In everyday contemporary English usage, the word property refers to 
objects or things, or to relationships between persons and things. Things 
and relations between persons and things constitute the two parts of the 
Oxford English Dictionary definition of property as 'owning, being 
owned; things owned, possession(s)'.4 
</p>
<p>While common usage emphasises property as objects or things, 
English-speaking scholars have generally considered property in terms of 
relations between persons. In this view, property is an abstraction rather 
than a thing. In English law, and in many of the legal traditions derived 
from English law, property is a right in something (or to something) 
rather than the thing itself To own property is to have an enforceable 
claim (that is, a right) to some use or benefit of some thing. The idea of 
an enforceable claim-be it enforceable by custom, convention, or law-
distinguishes property from mere occupancy or momentary physical 
possession (Macpherson 1978:3). 
</p>
<p>In this framework the claims that distinguish property from 
occupation or possession are claims in relation to other persons. When a 
</p>
<p>4 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>person buys a house or a car, what she or he purchases is the legal title, 
the enforceable right, to the tangible object. In the case of private 
property, such rights are exclusive or discriminatory in that they exclude 
others from using or benefiting from the object in question. In the case 
of common property, on the other hand, such rights are inclusive in that 
they guarantee that certain persons will not be excluded from the use or 
benefit of a tangible object. In this view, a system of property is a system 
of rights of each person in relation to other persons. In other words, 
property is a relation between persons with respect to things 
(Macpherson 1978:3-5; Hann 1998:4-5). 
</p>
<p>According to Macpherson (1978:7), the contemporary everyday use 
of 'property' to refer to things emerged in the seventeenth century with 
the spread of capitalist market economies and 'the replacement of old 
limited rights in land and other valuable things by virtually unlimited 
rights'. Prior to this, 'it was well understood that property was a right in 
something' rather than the thing itself. This understanding of property 
as rights stemmed from feudal ideas about land in which simultaneous 
multiple claims were recognised and in which anyone person's claims 
were limited and not fully disposable. With the spread of capitalist 
economies, however, limited rights in land were increasingly replaced 
with almost unlimited rights including the right to sell or otherwise 
dispose of land. As these rights became more absolute, Macpherson 
(1978:7-8) argued 
</p>
<p>It appeared to be the things themselves, not just rights in them, that were 
exchanged in the market. In fact the difference was not that things rather than 
rights were exchanged, but that previously un-saleable rights in things were now 
saleable; or, to put it differently, that limited and not always saleable rights in things 
were being replaced by virtually unlimited and saleable rights to things (emphasis in 
the original). 
</p>
<p>Alan Macfarlane (1998) has recently painted a more complex picture 
of the history of European legal thinking about property. He contrasted 
Roman law and English feudal law regarding property in the following 
terms 
</p>
<p>Roman lawyers saw the thing as property and it could be divided almost ad 
infinitum. Thus a piece ofland could be divided and sub-divided among heirs 
again and again. Feudal lawyers on the other hand saw the thing as indivisible, but 
the rights in it, that is the relationships between people, the bundle of social ties 
between people and resources, were almost infinitely expandable (Macfarlane 
1998:113; emphasis in the original).

<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>At the end of the twelfth century, land in most parts of Europe was 
thought of in these feudal terms. Around 1200, however, English law 
regarding property began to diverge from property laws in other parts of 
Europe in two critical ways. First, land in England became freely 
alienable. Whereas in other parts of Europe land was divided into small 
peasant family properties which could not easily be alienated because of 
the multiple claims that people had to them, by the thirteenth century 
in England people at all levels of society could alienate their land. 
Multiple claims were replaced by individual claims, the right to alienate 
land was added to the existing bundle of rights, and property relations 
became relations among persons. The second divergence between 
English property law and laws concerning property elsewhere in Europe 
resulted from the reintroduction of Roman law in most parts of 
Continental Europe between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries. The 
renewed influence of Roman legal ideas, which are reflected in the 
present-day legal codes of countries such as France, Germany, 
Switzerland and Italy, included a tendency 'to identifY ownership with 
the thing owned, and to limit [the] definition of things to movable or 
immovable property, as opposed to more abstract rights' (Macfarlane 
1998:111). In contrast, English law 'has developed from the tenures of 
medieval feudalism and has been more ready to analyse ownership in 
terms of bundles of rights, obligations and interpersonal relations arising 
from the control and enjoyment of property' (Macfarlane 1998:111-2). 
</p>
<p>The point here is not the detail of European laws about property, but 
the fact that those laws have changed over time and in relation to 
broader social and economic changes. The divergence between property 
laws at the beginning of the thirteenth century, for example, reflected 
differences in the organisation of agriculture in England and on the 
Continent which began during the second half of the twelfth century. 
More recently, the expansion of property rights corresponded to the 
spread of capitalist economies (Macfarlane 1998:111).

<p>Intellectual property 
Intellectual property is generally defined as property that is intangible 
or which has no physical form. The challenges posed by this 
intangibility have been central to the history of ideas about intellectual 
property and debates about its legal status, The contemporary 
intellectual property categories of copyright, patent, trademark and

<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>trade secrets, for example, which are described in detail in Leslie 
Harroun's contribution to this book, did not become fixed until the 
middle of the nineteenth century and their emergence was part of a 
critical transformation in how English law dealt with intangible 
property and rights in what was then called 'mental labour'. 
</p>
<p>English patent law had its origins in a medieval system of prerogative-
based privilege. The English monarch could, usually for a fee, grant an 
individual or company the exclusive right to undertake various economic 
activities, for example, the manufacture of certain items (Drahos 
1996:29). Successive monarchs abused this system because it was an 
easy source of revenue, and the English courts responded by striking 
down the monopolies on the ground that they interfered with freedom 
of trade. The one exception to this was the monopoly patent, which gave 
an inventor the exclusive right to reproduce his invention in return for 
bringing the knowledge about it into the public domain. This was 
reflected in the Statute of Monopolies which was passed by the English 
Parliament in 1623 and which made all monopolies void with the . 
exception of patent monopolies. 
</p>
<p>Like English patent law, English copyright law can be traced to the 
end of the practice of granting royal monopolies and to changes in the 
regulation of the book trade at the end of the seventeenth century. Prior 
to this, the Stationers' Company held a monopoly on printing in 
England which was granted by the Crown in order to restrict the print-
ing of seditious, heretical, blasphemous and obscene materials. Under 
the terms of this monopoly, it was an offence to publish a book that had 
not been approved and registered by the proper authorities. In exchange 
for accepting censorship on what they could print, the Stationers' 
Company obtained the commercial protection of an exclusive monopoly 
over printing. In this system, authors played a very limited role (Lange 
1997:76; Sherman and Bendy 1999:11; Strong 1997:256-8). 
</p>
<p>The Stationers' Company lost control of the printing trade when the 
Licensing Acts which granted their monopoly lapsed in 1695. These 
Acts were eventually replaced in 1709 by the Act for the 
Encouragement of Learning, commonly known as the Statute of Aune, 
which asserted a public interest in writing and publishing to justify an 
end to the printing monopoly. The expressed purpose of the statute was 
to encourage the spread of education by providing authors with an 
incentive to write and publish, and it did this by giving authors the 
right to control the publication of their own works for a limited period

</p>
<p>of time (either 14 or 28 years depending on the circumstances) after 
which their rights would lapse (Sherman and Bendy 1999:11-12). 
</p>
<p>Faced with losing their monopoly, the Stationers' Company argued 
that the rights granted by the Statute of Anne merely supplemented 
authors' perpetual rights under common law, rights under which 
authors had previously given permission to the Stationers' Company to 
print their works, This assertion of perpetual common law rights 
provoked a lively legal debate during the course of which a wide range of 
key legal ideas were examined critically and in detail. Central to this 
debate, which lasted until the mid nineteenth century and laid the 
foundations of modern intellectual property law, were questions about 
the extent to which property protection could be extended to 
intangibles and the nature of mental labour (later called 'creativity') 
which came to be seen as the link between the various areas of law which 
granted property rights in intangibles (ibid:13-16, 44), 
</p>
<p>Fundamental to the debate about the extension of the concept of 
property to intangibles was a distinction between discovering and 
creating which, in turn, rested on 'a belief in the existence of an a priori 
domain, a reservoir from which inventions were drawn' (ibid:44-5), This 
'reservoir' was variously called 'tradition', 'nature', 'principles' or 'the 
laws of science', Aspects of these domains could be discovered, but they 
could not be made the subject of property claims (that is, they could 
not be copyrighted or patented). Thus, electricity could be discovered, 
but it could not be patented (that is, one could not exclude other 
people from using electricity or benefiting from it), What could be 
granted the status of property was the transformation of abstract ideas 
into material or practical form, What was protected in intellectual 
property law was the human creativity that transformed 'nature' into 
products (ibid:44-7) , 
</p>
<p>In discussions of literary property, debate focused on whether the 
concept of property applied only to the right to print and reprint a 
particular work or whether it also extended to the ideas and knowledge 
contained in a written work. A narrow definition of literary property 
faced the problem of failing to protect an author's rights in cases of 
abridgement, compilation and translation, while a broader definition 
opened the problematic possibility of turning ideas and knowledge into 
property. What emerged from the debate was a definition of literary 
property as the specific ways in which words were combined in written 
expression, that is, the precise ways in which ideas and knowledge were

</p>
<p>represented or expressed. Mental labour or creativity (in this case the 
creativity of the author) was again central to the definition of intellectual 
property (ibid:19-42).5 
</p>
<p>In thinking about creativity in the Papua New Guinea context, an 
important aspect to consider is the relationship between tradition and 
creativity. The creativity of indigenous peoples in the creation of new 
knowledge or new art forms and styles is sometimes denied or 
diminished on the grounds that they are simply following their 
traditions. Popular Western ideas of non-Western peoples as timeless and 
unchanging (as least prior to Western contact and influence) sit 
uncomfortably with ideas of individual creativity by indigenous peoples. 
But the emphasis on the individual as creator that is often found in 
contemporary Western ideas of authorship and invention are not 
reflected in earlier discussions of intellectual property. Sherman and 
Bendy (1999:37) stated that 
</p>
<p>What is striking about much of what was written about intellectual property 
throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is how conscious 
commentators were of the interpersonal nature of creation, of the debt and 
connection which existed between authors. 
</p>
<p>Sherman and Bendy argued against romanticising the individual as 
creator and for the need to acknowledge the social and intellectual 
networks within which creativity takes place. This suggests that far from 
being part of the 'reservoir' of things that are simply waiting to be 
discovered, and therefore not amenable to property claims, tradition is a 
vital part of all creativity. 
</p>
<p>The legal debates that flowed from the Statute of Anne began with an 
assertion of a public interest in access to ideas and knowledge. They took 
for granted a particular shared understanding of mental labour (or 
creativity) and a historical and legal definition of property as rights in 
relation to tangible things. The debates transformed both the form and 
organisation of English intellectual property law as well as the subject 
matter protected and the role of registration in identifying intellectual 
property. The present day categories of copyright, patent, trademarks 
and trade secrets emerged during the course of the debate and were not 
clearly distinguished and established until the middle of the nineteenth 
century. Prior to this, there was no consensus as to how to categorise 
intellectual property, only a general agreement that English law 
recognised and granted property rights in mentallabour.6 Similarly, 
whereas prior to the mid nineteenth century the law was reactive and

<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>subject specific (for example, it dealt with the printing of designs on 
fabric, but not the general question of designs), after the mid-nineteenth 
century intellectual property law was abstract and tried to anticipate 
issues that would be raised by new forms of tangible property. Whereas 
earlier English intellectual property law was concerned with issues that 
the law itself identified as metaphysical (for example, identifYing the 
essence of mental labour or creativity) by 1850 the law had abandoned 
such philosophical issues and was concerned less with what was 
embodied in an object than with the object itself and its economic 
implications. Paralleling this shift to a concern with the economic 
implications of intellectual property was a shift to the language and 
concepts of political economy and utilitarianism. Finally, by 1850 the 
issue of proving rights in intellectual property had become a matter of 
public concern, and bureaucratic registration identified the limits of 
intellectual property (Sherman and Bendy 1999:3-5). 
</p>
<p>Sherman and Bendy explicitly argued against 'those who present 
intellectual property law as if it were a timeless entity that has always 
existed' and against those who assert that the present-day categories of 
intellectual property (for example, patents, copyright) are 'a natural 
ordering' or the product of a considered philosophical position. Instead, 
both the general category of intellectual property and more specific 
categories of intellectual property emerged from a historical process of a 
period of some 120 years (roughly from 1730 to 1850) during which 
industrial technology and capitalism expanded rapidly, and during 
which property protection was gradually extended from one type of 
intangible thing to another on the basis of arguments by analogy. What 
linked these new forms of property was their relationship to mental 
labour and creativity (ibid: 16).7 
</p>
<p>International treaties and conventions 
While the development of intellectual property law reflected innovations 
in industrial technology and the expansion of capitalism, expanding 
international trade during the second half of the nineteenth century and 
the twentieth century led to the development of international 
agreements concerning intellectual property, the earliest of which date 
to the 1880s. 
</p>
<p>The primary international treaty covering patents, trademarks and 
industrial designs is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial 
Property, first signed in 1883 and most recently revised in 1967. At 
</p>
<p>10 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>present, approximately 98 countries are signatories, but Papua New 
Guinea is not among them (Gervais 1998:440). The Convention 
provides for the standardisation of the procedures for applying for and 
granting patents. Prior to 1883, national patent systems varied 
considerably, and this created obstacles to the international assertion of 
patent rights. The Convention also stipulates that a signatory country 
cannot provide less intellectual properry protection to residents of other 
signatory countries than it does to its own citizens. This requirement, 
which is often called 'national treatment' because foreigners are treated as 
nationals, together with the Convention's failure to establish standards 
for national enforcement have often been criticised because countries 
that do not provide a certain level of intellectual properry protection for 
their own citizens are not required to provide it for foreigners either. A 
further criticism of the Paris Convention is that it does not provide 
effective mechanisms for settling disputes which under the Convention 
are referred to the International Court of Justice (Ab bott 1997; Moy 
1997). 
</p>
<p>The principal treary for protecting copyright is the Berne Convention 
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works which was first signed 
in 1886. At present, there are some 88 member states, and again Papua 
New Guinea is not a signatory (Gervais 1998:440). As with the Paris 
Convention, the Berne Convention requires signatories to extend the 
same copyright protection to residents of other signatory countries as 
they grant to their own citizens. It also establishes minimum standards 
of protection including minimum copyright periods (generally the life 
of the author plus 50 years) and defines the moral right of authors such 
as the right to authorise translations and the right to protect the 
integriry of artistic works. Although the main emphasis is on the rights 
of authors, these are balanced against concerns about public access to 
information such as current news or political statements. As in the case 
of the Paris Convention, disputes over interpretation and enforcement of 
the Berne Convention can be brought to the International Court of 
Justice. The Berne Convention, however, does not include either 
standards for determining when an infringement has occurred or any 
method for penalising countries that do not meet their treary 
obligations (Abbott 1997; Burger 1997). 
</p>
<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, revisions were made to the 
Berne Convention, primarily in the direction of expanded rights for 
authors. In 1967, however, the expansion of authors' rights was opposed 
</p>
<p>11 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>by developing countries at a meeting of signatory countries held in 
Stockholm. Developing countries demanded special concessions such as 
licenses for translations and shorter periods of copyright protection, 
concessions that would have given them greater and less expensive access 
to published materials but which would have also significantly 
weakened the rights of authors. Authors and publishers in developed 
countries were so opposed to these concessions that in the end no 
changes were made to the Convention at the Stockholm meeting 
(Burger 1997:263). 
</p>
<p>A significant result of the Stockholm meeting, however, was the 
creation of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) which 
is an agency of the United Nations. Its goals are to encourage the 
international protection of intellectual property and to administer 
international treaties and conventions concerned with intellectual 
property. Thus, the WIPO administers both the Paris Convention and 
the Berne Convention as well as the Madrid Agreement, which 
simplifies procedures for filing trademarks in different countries, and the 
Rome Convention, which provides international protection for 
performers, phonogram producers and broadcasting organisations. 8 
</p>
<p>Conflicting interests between industrialised and less industrialised 
countries with regard to intellectual property have continued. 
Developed countries saw the Berne Convention as lacking effective 
enforcement mechanisms and as unduly subject to the desires of 
developing countries for less restrictive access to intellectual property. 
These concerns at least partly explain the recent development of the 
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (generally 
known as the TRIPs Agreement) which is part of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (D'Amato and Long 1997:267-8; Long 
and D'Amato 1997). 
</p>
<p>The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property was 
drawn up during the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations 
which began in 1986 under the GATT framework. These negotiations 
also resulted in the formation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) 
which came into existence on 1 January 1995. Papua New Guinea 
joined the WTO in June 1996 and is therefore bound by the Agreement 
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property. The inclusion of 
intellectual property rights and their enforcement within the Uruguay 
Round stemmed from proposals by Japan and the United States which 
were dissatisfied with efforts to resolve intellectual property issues, 
</p>
<p>12 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>especially disputes, through WIPO. Many less developed countries 
objected to using GATT to establish international standards in the area 
of intellectual property, arguing that WIPO was the appropriate forum 
in which to do this. They viewed GATT, with its emphasis on free trade, 
as a forum favouring industrialised countries, and they believed that the 
Paris and Berne Conventions, with their emphasis on national treatment 
for intellectual property issues, had already resolved the issues with 
which GATT was proposing to deal (Gervais 1998:3; Long 1997). 
</p>
<p>The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
both builds on earlier international treaties regarding intellectual 
property and represents a new departure from them. Most of the 
substantive provisions of the Paris and Berne Conventions were 
incorporated into the TRIPs Agreement, although an author's moral 
rights (as opposed to economic rights)-that is, 'the right to claim 
authorship of the work and to object to any distortion, mutilation or 
other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the said 
work' (Article 6bis of the Berne Convention)-were not included in the 
TRIPs Agreement. 9 But the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property goes beyond the Paris and Berne Conventions by 
adding new intellectual property rights (such as the protection of 
confidential information) and, more importantly, by setting out both 
rules for enforcing intellectual property rights and provisions for dealing 
with disputes under the integrated dispute settlement system of the 
WTO. These are significant changes to the international treatment of 
intellectual property because they highlight the commercial and trade 
aspects of intellectual property (for example, by insisting that 
enforcement procedures should not create 'barriers to legitimate trade) 
and because they replace a general obligation to provide legal remedies 
to infringement of intellectual property rights through national 
legislation with a harmonised set of international legal principles and 
procedures. As David Demiray (1997:268) has argued 
</p>
<p>Since the creation of GATT .. .intellectual property has undergone a fundamental 
conceptual change: the emphasis has moved away from sovereign matters-for 
example, one of protective norms restricted to the territory of the state-to issues of 
adequate protection of intellectual property rights abroad. As the economic 
importance of exports has increased, so have the needs for improved extra-territorial 
protection of intellectual property rights.

<p>subsistence gardeners and farmers, are the provisions in Article 27 of the 
Agreement concerning the patenting of animals, plants and plant 
varieties. Article 27 allows member states to prohibit the patenting of 
'plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially 
biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than 
non-biological or microbiological processes'. But Article 27 also states 
that 'Members shall provide for the protection of plant varieties either 
by patents or by an effective sui generis [special purpose] system or by 
any combination thereof'.lO In other words, while Papua New Guinea 
may prohibit the patenting of plants and animals (for example, by 
multinational pharmaceutical companies), it must recognise and protect 
the intellectual property rights, either through patents or through a 
special purpose system, of those who develop new plant varieties. The 
danger in this requirement lies in the introduction of property rights 
over plant resources previously thought of as being held in common and 
in the fact that the requirement ignores the informal agricultural and 
horticultural systems through which farmers and gardeners in 
developing countries such as Papua New Guinea breed a wide variety of 
plants. At the same time, Article 27 provides the possibility that Papua 
New Guinea could develop a sui generis system of protection that reflects 
the interests of Papua New Guineans (Posey and Dutfield 1996:102-3). 
</p>
<p>The centrality of intellectual property issues to contemporary 
biological concerns was highlighted in the Convention on Biological 
Diversity (CBD) that emerged from the 1992 World Conference on 
Environment and Development that was held in Rio de Janeiro. It was 
highlighted both in the central place of intellectual property in the 
CBD and by the fact that the United States refused to sign the 
Convention believing it would erode conventional patent rights. Article 
8(j) of the Convention on Biological Diversity specifically obliges 
contracting parties to 
</p>
<p>Respect, presetve and maintain knowledge, innovations, and practices of indigenous 
and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the consetvation 
and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with 
the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and 
practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the 
utilisation of such knowledge, innovations and practices (cited in Posey and 
Outfield 1996: 1 04). 
</p>
<p>Article 16 of the Convention on Biological Diversity also deals with 
intellectual property issues and requires greater access to and transfer of

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>technology, including technology protected by patents and intellectual 
property laws. In making this requirement, the Convention on 
Biological Diversity accords the same legal status to the knowledge and 
technologies of indigenous peoples as it does to Western knowledge and 
technology. As Darrell Posey and Graham Dutfield have noted 
</p>
<p>Indigenous and traditional technologies have rarely been considered to be 
'technologies' in international parlance. This pattern is part of the larger trend to 
downgrade, overlook, and minimise the knowledge, innovations, and practices of 
indigenous peoples. The CBD, however, specifically elevates these elements to a 
central concern as technologies relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of 
biological diversity (Posey and Dutfield 1996: 106-7). 
</p>
<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity thus requires contracting parties 
to provide legal protection for indigenous knowledge, innovations, and 
practices. 
</p>
<p>The distinction between discovering and creating remains critical for 
contemporary discussions of property rights in biological resources. 
Biological materials were traditionally excluded from property 
protection under Western law because they are part of nature and not 
the result of individual creative effort. They could be discovered, but 
they could not be patented. During the twentieth century, intellectual 
property law adapted to changing technology and many countries now 
extend property protection to the products of biotechnological 
engineering and to new varieties of plants. In recent years there has also 
been a changing recognition of the rights of nations to exercise 
sovereignty over products of nature' as discussed in Rosa Kambuou's 
contribution to this book. Much of this change has occurred in the 
realm of international cooperation between governments in relation to 
agricultural production and the protection of biodiversity rather than 
through the adaptation of intellectual property law. 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property law continues to favour those who have 
contributed specific mental labour to developing new products from 
nature, and it accords no rights to those who own or control access to 
natural resources such as plants that contain chemical compounds useful 
to pharmaceutical companies. Contemporary discourse emphasises the 
failure of Western law to recognise the communal rights of indigenous 
peoples. The idea that the natural world is a reservoir that cannot be the 
subject of property rights is seen in this context as dovetailing with the 
economic imperatives of colonial enterprise, and providing a justification 
for the expropriation of natural resources at the expense of their original

</p>
<p>indigenous custodians. The expansion of intellectual property rights to 
include those indigenous custodians thus becomes an avenue to right at 
least in part the wrongs that have created international political and 
economic inequalities. 
</p>
<p>This viewpoint sits well with concepts of intellectual property rights. 
Just as land is returned to those from whom it was stolen, so too can 
rights to intangible property be returned. But if we expand intellectual 
property rights to include those outside the realm of inventive labour, 
who should be included and who should be excluded? This question 
returns us again to the distinction between intellectual property (such as 
chemical compounds and gene sequences) and the physical objects (such 
as plants and other forms of biodiversity) from which they are derived. 
Where this distinction is blurred, custodianship of the physical objects 
from which the intangible property is created seems to be a logical nexus 
of ownership. One might want, for example, to return the proceeds of 
pharmaceutical discoveries to the communities from which the original 
plant material was taken. But intellectual property laws as we know 
them today are precisely about severing the rights to intangible property 
from the physical objects from which they are derived. After all, 
intellectual property is thought of as a single object (for example, the 
copyright for a book or a new plant variety), but the intellectual 
property may be manifested in millions of physical objects (for example, 
the physical books or plants). 
</p>
<p>These issues are confronting governments and researchers today in the 
course of negotiating agreements which set the framework for the 
distribution of benefits, as Lohi Matainaho describes in his contribution 
to this book. His chapter introduces the idea that the value of biological 
resources might vary depending on the extent of the contribution that 
local people make to the overall discovery process. In many cases, the 
contribution may be more than just the plants themselves. Traditional 
knowledge will often inform researchers about the kinds of species they 
are looking for. Here the issues become even more complex. While 
knowledge is clearly something that can be owned, we need to focus on 
what happens to that knowledge when we subject it to an intellectual 
property regime which allows knowledge to be alienated as well as 
protected. Should the alienation of knowledge (which is basic to its 
commercial value) that might be shared by other peoples be restricted in 
some way? Intellectual property law has never addressed itself to this 
question, since it has never catered for communally-owned knowledge.

<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>Property and intellectual property in Papua New 
Guinea 
James Carrier (1998:85) has recently noted that anthropologists 
working in Melanesia have paid little attention to property per se, and 
this reflects an omission in anthropology generally (Hann 1998). In the 
case of Papua New Guinea, an exception to Carrier's generalisation is the 
attention that anthropologists and other researchers have paid to land 
tenure, although Carrier (1998:85) argued that such studies often take 
the idea of property for granted and deal primarily with kinship, social 
organisation and production in relation to land. In summarising studies 
of land tenure in Papua New Guinea, Thomas Harding noted both that 
land is often owned by groups rather than individuals and that ideas of 
land ownership generally exclude two rights which are among the rights 
included in Western ideas about land ownership: the right to alienate 
land and the right to receive income from it (1972:604-5). 
</p>
<p>While ideas about property other than land have not been an explicit 
focus for researchers in Papua New Guinea, considerable attention has 
been paid to cultural ideas about what it means to be a person, to 
relations between persons and things and to the ways in which people 
transact objects. If the anthropology of Papua New Guinea is not known 
for its examination of property, it is well known for its examination of 
exchange, the published literature on which is enormous. l1 
</p>
<p>Discussions of exchange in Papua New Guinea have often used a 
distinction between commodities and gifts-and between commodity 
economies and gift economies-to characterise differences between 
economic systems and activities in Western societies and Papua New 
Guinea societies, respectively. This distinction highlights the fact that 
exchanges of goods in Western societies serve primarily to establish 
relations between the objects exchanged by determining their prices and 
relative values. In contrast, the primary purpose and result of gift 
exchanges are to establish and maintain relations between persons 
making such exchanges (Gregory 1982:18-19).12 
</p>
<p>Commodity economies and gift economies thus involve different 
kinds of relationships between persons with respect to things. In other 
words, they are based on distinct concepts of property. But they also 
involve different relationships between persons and things. Alienability 
and a clear separation between persons and things are fundamental to 
commodity exchanges, but the power of gift exchanges to create

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>enduring social relationships lies precisely in the fact that the objects 
given are not completely alienated. 
</p>
<p>In this view, when Highlands men exchange pigs or shells they are 
not trying to determine the relative prices or values of what they are 
exchanging. The point is not to establish that a large female pig is worth 
a particular number of pearl shells. Nor are pigs or shells from one 
person the same as pigs or shells from another person. The persons 
giving and receiving the objects are critical to the purpose of the 
exchange which is not motivated by a desire to maximise the yield or 
profit from the exchange but by a desire to establish and maintain 
particular types of social relations (such as peace, alliance, or inequality 
of rank or prestige) with particular persons. These social relations are 
mediated through the objects that are given and received, and a 
significant part of the meaning of those objects lies in the people who 
produced, owned and gave them. 
</p>
<p>Carrier (1998:86-8) has recently recast the difference between 
property relations in Melanesian and Western societies in terms of 
'inclusive' and 'exclusive' ideas of property. He argued that Melanesians 
have an 'inclusive notion of property' in which objects reflect and are 
embedded in lasting relationships between people involved in the 
objects' histories. A previous owner of an object continues to be 
associated with that object even after it leaves his or her possession, and 
objects are a vital part of a person's relationships with other people. 
Carrier contrasted this with the 'exclusive form of property' of the 
modern West in which an object is controlled by and associated with 
only the person who owns it at the moment. 
</p>
<p>Having argued for a distinction between inclusive and exclusive 
property, Carrier also provides a salutary warning against dichotomising 
and totalising, against imagining that inclusive property is the only way 
that Melanesians think about objects or that objects in Western societies 
are only commodities. He pointed out that socially embedded or 
inclusive ideas of property do not seem to apply when Melanesians act 
in the urban, capitalist economy. 'Melanesians,' he wrote, 'have 
commodities and exclusive property just as surely as Westerners have 
gifts and inclusive property' (Carrier 1998:101).13 
</p>
<p>While English law has been reluctant to extend the concept of 
property to intangibles, rituals, stories, songs, personal names, artistic 
designs and specialist knowledge are among the intangibles to which 
Papua New Guineans claim ownership and which they exchange with

<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>others. In an essay on Ritual as Intellectual Property, Simon Harrison 
(1992:234-5) noted that while such intangibles are exchanged as 
economic goods, they (like all intangible items) are interesting because 
'They presuppose a shared universe of information and meaning, and 
depend upon that universe not only for their value but for their very 
reality'. Bur he noted a critical difference in rationale between Western 
intellectual property law14 and Melanesian ideas abour the ownership of 
intangibles, a difference which echoes the distinction between gifts and 
commodities. Whereas intellectual property law seeks to encourage 
public disclosure of innovations by protecting the rights (especially the 
commercial rights) of innovators, the ownership and exchange of 
intangibles in Melanesia serve primarily to create and maintain social 
relations such as inequalities in rank and prestige. Western intellectual 
property law seeks to define products of human creativity that can be 
alienated from their creators and exchanged for other commodities in a 
system concerned with establishing the relative values of the objects 
exchanged. In Papua New Guinea, the ownership of intangibles does not 
necessarily include the possibility of alienation, and the exchange of 
intangibles does not determine their value. 
</p>
<p>At least in some Papua New Guinea societies, the value of knowledge, 
for example, is inversely related to the number of persons who possess it. 
The more people who know something, the less significant it is assumed 
to be. Restricting access to knowledge can reinforce cultural identity and 
strengthen social hierarchies and inequalities (Harrison 1995:12). The 
restriction of certain types of knowledge to initiated men in some Papua 
New Guinea societies strengthens inequalities that exist in other 
domains between men and women and between senior and junior males 
(Barth 1975; Whitehead 1986). Knowledge of particular stories, songs, 
dances, rituals or artistic designs can serve as markers of cultural or 
group identity, and their use by outsiders without permission is a 
serious violation of ownership rights (Schwartz 1975). Jacob Simet's 
essay in this book explores ownership and restrictions on the use of such 
cultural markers among Tolai of East New Britain. 
</p>
<p>A consideration of practices associated with intangible property 
reveals similarities as well as differences in how Westerners and Papua 
New Guineans deploy, manipulate, and protect knowledge. Harrison 
(1995:13), for example, has compared the concerns of Manambu clans, 
software companies, and universities with regard to the management of 
knowledge. Among the Manambu, who live along the Sepik River, each

<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>of the various clans has its own secret myths, known only to a few of its 
senior men. These myths provide the basis for land ownership. On the 
one hand, the myths cannot be disclosed to outsiders because the 
outsiders could then use the myths to make their own claims to land. At 
the same time, a clan must partially disclose its myths so that outsiders 
will acknowledge the clan's claims to land ownership. In other words, a 
clan must maintain a balance between disclosure and protection of 
knowledge, a balance which software companies and universities must 
also strike if they are to be successful. Software companies must reveal 
just enough of the knowledge that they create so that they are not 
marginalised by their competitors while at the same time protecting 
themselves through secrecy, copyrights and patents from having their 
ideas stolen. And as education becomes increasingly redefined in 
commodity terms, with courses as products and students as consumers, 
universities must both disseminate knowledge and treat that knowledge 
as a commercial product. Based on this comparison, Harrison (1995:13) 
concluded that 
</p>
<p>... all institutions producing and managing knowledge are faced with the same basic 
dilemma in one form or another. The dilemma is that they depend for their 
existence both on producing and communicating knowledge and on keeping this 
knowledge in some respects their property. 
</p>
<p>Any practical consideration of Papua New Guinean ideas and customs 
concerning property and intellectual property must consider the 
country's legal system and the place, or potential place, of custom 
within that system. Schedule 2 of the Papua New Guinea Constitution 
states that custom and English common law at the time of 
independence together make up the country's 'underlying law'. This is 
one of several types of law identified in Section 9 of the Constitution as 
comprising Papua New Guinea law as a whole. Schedule 2 states that 
'custom is adopted, and shall be applied and enforced, as part of the 
underlying law' unless the custom is inconsistent with the Constitution 
or statute law. 15 Custom takes precedence over common law inasmuch as 
common law is only applied and enforced if there is no statute law or 
customary law regarding a particular issue, 
</p>
<p>Despite the precedence given to custom by the Constitution, 
Nonggorr (1995) has noted three factors that contribute to custom 
being relegated in practice to second place behind the common law. 
First, Section 5 of the Native Customs (Recognition) Act (Chapter 19) 
requires that customs 'shall be ascertained as though they were matters 
</p>
<p>20 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>of fact'. In other words, one must first prove in court that a particular 
custom exists before it can be considered as part of the underlying law. 
Proving that a custom exists can be onerous and is certainly more 
difficult than citing a common law principle. As Nonggorr (1995:74) 
writes 
</p>
<p>The adopted common law, which finds its origins in customary law as well, is not 
required to be proved as fact merely because it is readily available in the recorded 
case law and text books. Yet customary law must not only be proven as fact, it must 
be tested by the use of common law-based procedure (cf. Otdey 1995:104). 
</p>
<p>Second, common law often takes precedence over customary law because 
Papua New Guinea lawyers are trained in common law. Finally, common 
law is more prominent than customary law, according to Nonggorr 
(1995:75), 'because of the adoption of common law institutions, 
systems, and, indeed, the whole economic and political system'. 
</p>
<p>Village, Local, and District Courts can resolve disputes according to 
custom,16 but these are not the only arenas, or perhaps even the main 
arenas, in which intellectual property disputes will be heard. In 
considering laws to explicitly protect rights in intellectual property, it is 
critical that Papua New Guinean ideas about ownership, property, 
knowledge, and creativity are taken into account if those laws are to 
reflect the contemporary social and political contexts in which they will 
be applied. An important contribution of Leslie Harroun's essay in this 
book is the point that conventional intellectual property mechanisms do 
not adequately accommodate communal ownership of property and that 
access to the protection that such mechanisms afford is limited because 
of the high transaction costs. The recognition of communal property, 
including communal intellectual property, must be central to Papua 
New Guinea intellectual property law, and whatever intellectual 
property regime is put in place must consider the practical implications 
of that regime for average Papua New Guineans who want to protect the 
products of their creativity. 
</p>
<p>Marilyn Strathern's essay, however, suggests that there may be even 
more fundamental ways in which Euro-American concepts of property 
do not sit easily in the Papua New Guinea context. She challenges the 
very applicability of European concepts of property and knowledge that 
underpin ideas about intellectual property rights. These concepts are of 
course changing in industrialised countries even as they are changing in 
Papua New Guinea. But Western discussions of property have mainly 
focused on property as things and as social relations between people 
</p>
<p>21 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>with respect to things. Strathern argues that Papua New Guinean 
concepts of property introduce a third dimension of property-the 
process of transaction itself. Papua New Guinean ideas of knowledge and 
creativity as both socially embedded and transactable would give rise to 
a system of intellectual property law quite different from the Western 
one which has increasingly focused on protection for individual rights 
and on the commodification of the property that is the subject of the 
right. 
</p>
<p>The four essays by Jacob Simet, Mark Busse, John Muke, and Don 
Niles in this book highlight through concrete examples the importance 
of taking seriously Papua New Guinean ideas about the production and 
ownership of knowledge and cultural forms in contemporary and 
increasingly global contexts. Simet shows that Tolai customary law 
includes restrictions on the use of cultural materials such&middot; as songs, 
designs for dance costumes, and healing practices which are similar in 
some ways to the protection provided by Western intellectual property 
law. His chapter is thus a contribution to the development of Papua 
New Guinea's underlying law concerning intellectual property. In 
Western law, however, there is a clear distinction between the 
intellectual property in a painting, for example, and the ownership of 
the physical object itself. Each involves a distinct set of rights. But it can 
be difficult to draw this distinction in the Papua New Guinea context 
notwithstanding the fact that the legal protection of cultural property is 
narrowly focused on the protection of physical objects, as Busse explains 
in his essay. 
</p>
<p>Muke's chapter confronts the complex and difficult subject of the 
social relations within which knowledge is created and the different 
expectations that people have about those relations. His discussion of 
the complex relations among anthropologists, archaeologists and people 
who live near the Kuk early agricultural site in Western Highlands 
Province brings us back to the artificial distinction between the 
expression of ideas in researchers' notebooks, which are protected under 
conventional copyright law, and the ideas they contain, which are not. 
</p>
<p>Niles reminds us that the intellectual property laws that Papua New 
Guinea is obliged to put in place by virtue of its membership in the 
WTO will regulate relations between Papua New Guineans as well as 
those with potentially exploitative outsiders. He poses an interesting 
question in this respect by juxtaposing the theft of Papua New Guinea's 
traditional music by non-Papua New Guinean performers with two 
</p>
<p>22 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>other forms of theft-the appropriation by contemporary Papua New 
Guinean musicians of Western music and of traditional Papua New 
Guinean music from societies other than their own-and he asks 
whether such practices should also be controlled. 
</p>
<p>Beyond intellectual property rights 
The phrase 'intellectual property rights' refers to a set of complex issues 
of considerable contemporaty significance. Current international debates 
over the sequencing of human genes, the development of the internet, 
the preservation of cultural heritage, the protection of biodiversity and 
the development and patenting of new crops and new drugs, all involve, 
in one way or another, questions of intellectual property. They are linked 
by legal questions concerning the ownership of intangibles, an area of 
law that emerged in the context of the expansion of capitalist economies 
and accelerating technological innovation. But these are not just 
international issues, they are issues that increasingly confront Papua 
New Guinea and they call for the development of legal frameworks for 
relationships, both between Papua New Guineans and between Papua 
New Guineans and others, with respect to intellectual property. The 
essays in this book all address concerns for which intellectual property 
rights are seen as an answer-such as the equitable distribution of the 
wealth that flows from exploitation of biodiversity and the fundamental 
right of people to control their cultural heritage-and they are intended 
as a contribution to emerging debates concerning intellectual property 
in Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>The use of 'intellectual property' as a catch-all phrase, however, risks 
obscuring opportunities for lateral thinking. Some authors, such as 
Posey and Dutfield (19%), for example, have questioned whether the 
paradigm of intellectual property rights is the most effective paradigm 
for defending the rights and resources of indigenous peoples. They note 
that legal frameworks for intellectual property are increasingly focused 
on the commercial value of economic property and ignore the moral and 
political reasons (for example, the desire for self-determination) that may 
motivate people to want to protect their intellectual property. They also 
noted that inequalities of power and wealth may make it difficult, if not 
impossible, for indigenous peoples to defend their intellectual property 
rights in courts of law. As a result of these difficulties, Posey and 
Dutfield proposed a shift from intellectual property rights to what they 
call 'traditional resource rights'. The phrase 'traditional resource rights' 
</p>
<p>23 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>refers to a bundle of rights-such as human rights, the right to self-
determination, and the right to give prior informed consent-which are 
enshrined in international agreements and which can be used as the 
basis for sui generis systems (Posey and Dutfield 1996:94-6). 
</p>
<p>There is a growing discussion of sui generis systems of intellectual 
property rights protection and the hope that they might diminish 
economic and political inequality by protecting the intangible property 
that is important to indigenous peoples as well as that which is of 
commercial value to industrialised countries. Intellectual property laws, 
however, function in many respects as a global legal system, which is 
what makes them so powerful. The international conventions and the 
standardisation of intellectual property law around the world means that 
they are an effective trans-border means of enforcing private rights. A sui 
generis system developed in Papua New Guinea would be virtually 
useless in protecting the exploitation of traditional knowledge elsewhere 
in the world, unless other countries agreed to adopt similar laws. While 
the long process of achieving international consensus on a framework for 
mutual recognition of sui generis systems proceeds, there is an urgent 
need to find alternative mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>Many of the problems posed by intellectual property rights for 
protecting indigenous knowledge might be solved in other ways. The 
essays by Kathy Whimp and Brendan Tobin in this book explore 
avenues that might provide a useful approach to controlling how 
indigenous knowledge is used. Tobin's chapter focuses on licensing as a 
mechanism for maintaining effective control over indigenous knowledge 
as trade secrets, while Whimp's discusses the use of systems for 
governing access to, and use of, indigenous knowledge and biological 
resources. Access regimes essentially establish national gate-keeping 
systems that ensure that just terms prevail when indigenous knowledge 
or biological resources are used. Combined with contractual provisions 
that are enforceable under international law, they can be a strong lever 
for negotiating equitable benefit sharing arrangements. 
</p>
<p>The development of mechanisms for protecting intellectual, biological 
and cultural property in Papua New Guinea, whether through access 
regimes, sui generis systems or more conventional intellectual property 
laws, requires an understanding of complex and interrelated legal, 
commercial, social and philosophical issues. Fundamental to these issues 
are Papua New Guinean ideas about creativity and the production of 
knowledge, and about relationships between persons with respect to 
</p>
<p>24 </p>
<p/>

<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>knowledge and the products of creative activity. On-going debates about 
such ideas have been critical in the development of Western intellectual 
property laws and practices, and the results of those debates can be seen 
in the distinction between discovering and creating, in the granting of 
copyright to the expression of ideas rather than to the ideas themselves, 
in the encouragement of innovation through restrictions on access to the 
results of innovations, and in the balancing of intellectual property 
interests against the benefits of creative activities to society as a whole. 
Contemporary Western treatments of intellectual property-whether 
encoded in varying national laws or international agreements such as 
TRIPs-are, however, neither intrinsic to ideas of intangible property 
nor historically inevitable. They are rather responses to changes in 
technology, economy and society. Their applicability to contemporary 
circumstances in Papua New Guinea is a central theme in the essays that 
comprise this volume. 
</p>
<p>Notes 
1 At one point, Linden (1991:54) did state that 'While some 
</p>
<p>[traditional knowledge] can be gathered in interviews and stored on 
tape, much information is seamlessly interwoven with a way of life. 
Boston anthropologist J ason Clay therefore insists that knowledge is 
best kept alive in the culture that produced it'. But this was not the 
general approach taken in the article. 
</p>
<p>2 Only at one point does Linden (1991 :54) alluded to the issue of 
property. Noting that a study sponsored by the US National Cancer 
Institute had identified some chemical compounds that appeared 
promising for the treatment of AIDS and cancer, Linden stated, 'If 
any of them turn out to be useful as medicines, the country from 
which the plant came would get a cut of the profits'. 
</p>
<p>3 According to Section 9 of the Constitution, the laws of Papua New 
Guinea include, in order of superiority, the Constitution, the 
Organic Laws, Acts of Parliament, emergency regulations, provincial 
laws, laws made under the Constitution, and 'the underlying law'. 
Under Schedule 2 of the Constitution pre-independence laws were 
adopted as Acts of Parliament at independence. Schedule 2 also 
defines 'the underlying law' as including both Papua New Guinea 
custom and 'the principles and rules of common law and equity in 
England' as they existed immediately before independence (see 
Nonggorr 1995).

<p>4 The word 'own', in turn, is defined by the Oxford English 
Dictionary as 'have as property, possess'. 
</p>
<p>5 Sherman and Bendy (1999:52) noted that ' ... expression was thought 
to carry with it a number of characteristics which provided the means 
by which the conflicting tasks the law had set for itself were 
accomplished. On the one hand, expression was abstract and 
isomorphic enough for it to be reproducible and repeatable. At the 
same time, the expressive contribution of the author, as well as that of 
the inventor, engraver and designer, was such that it always enabled 
the property to be identified.' Over time, however, it became clear 
that definitions of intellectual property in terms of how ideas were 
expressed was unsatisfactory. Sherman and Bendy (1999:54-5) 
argued that many contemporary intellectual property controversies 
(for example, regarding computer programs) turn on precisely the 
'twin demands' of being able both to identifY property and to protect 
authors and inventors from competitors who would slightly modifY 
their texts or designs and then claim them to be distinct. 
</p>
<p>6 Sherman and Bendy (1999: 18) described the process through which 
these categories emerged in the following terms: ' ... just as we see the 
opening up of a general space for mental labour we also witness 
changes that would help to set the limits of the general category and, 
in turn, play a role in shaping the categories of modem intellectual 
property. Typically, these moves were a by-product of attempts to 
have new forms of subject matter protected by the law. Rather than 
focusing upon the general category of mental labour, attention was 
placed on a specific area of mental labour: on those forms of mental 
labour which had already been granted property protection. This was 
because when a case was made for extending property protection to a 
new subject matter it was usually done by drawing an analogy with 
pre-existing modes of protection. More specifically, this was done by 
showing that the new subject matter shared similar features with the 
subject matter that had already been given protection. As such, the 
task for those arguing for protection was to find a common link 
between the forms of mental labour which had already been given 
property status and the particular case in hand. In these 
circumstances it thus became important not only to be able to 
identifY how and where the boundaries of the pre-existing forms of 
protection were drawn, but also to be in a position to extrapolate 
from the pre-existing regimes in which property rights were granted.'

<p>Introduction 
</p>
<p>7 There is no single history of ideas concerning intellectual property 
even in Europe. Instead, the extension of property rights to 
intangibles took different forms in different countries as a result of 
social, political, and economic differences. French copyright law, for 
example, emphasises the rights of the author or creator, while US 
copyright law echoes the Statute of Anne and places public interest 
on the same level or even above the rights of the author (Ginsbutg 
1997:79). Similarly, in discussing international differences in the 
legal treatment of intellectual property, Long and D'Amato 
(1997: 7) noted that, ' ... the impact of language cannot be 
minimised. For example, among the issues which has [sic] been the 
subject of heated debate in the international community is the scope 
of rights granted an author for the act of creation. These rights, 
premised on the value added to the work by the unique personality 
of the human creator, differ from the rights granted under a nation's 
copyright laws. They generally include the rights of patrimony (or 
attribution), integrity, withdrawal and disclosure. In France the 
concept is referred to as 'droit moral,' in Germany, 
'urheberspersonlichkeitsrecht,' in the United States 'moral rights or 
inherent rights.' Similarly, while the US uses the term 'copyright,' 
France uses the phrase 'droit d'auteur' (or 'droits de l'auteur') and 
Germany uses the term 'urheberrecht'to refer to a creator's right to 
control the reproduction and dissemination of her works. Although 
these phrases are rough equivalents of one another, such equivalency 
does not fully reflect the differing philosophical and legal precepts 
represented by the original, untranslated phrases.' 
</p>
<p>8 The rights protected under the Rome Convention are often called 
'neighbouting rights' because they are close to the rights protected 
under copyright. 
</p>
<p>9 Article 6bis of the Berne Convention still applies to signatories of 
that Convention. The exclusion of moral rights from the TRIPs 
Agreement was justified on the grounds that they are not trade 
related, and the effect of the exclusion is that disputes over moral 
rights cannot be settled through the WTO. At the same time, some 
countries saw the exclusion of moral rights as a victory of the Anglo-
American copyright system over systems that emphasise the moral 
rights of authors (Gervais 1998:73).

<p>11 Exchange, as we use it here, refers to the transfer of things between 
social persons. The persons making an exchange may act individually 
or collectively, and the objects transferred may be tangible (for 
example, pigs, shells, axe blades) or intangible (for example, stories, 
artistic designs, rituals). While exchange in this broad sense is part of 
social life in all societies, it has been a particularly prominent 
concept in discussions of Papua New Guinea societies where 
exchange is often fundamental to social relations (Carrier 1996). 
</p>
<p>12 The identification of gifts as a distinct type of economic transaction 
can be traced to the French sociologist Marcel Mauss whose 1925 
Essai sur le Don (usually translated as 'The Gift') laid the foundation 
for the distinction between gifts and commodities. 
</p>
<p>13 C&pound; Nicholas Thomas's (1991) critique of the distinction between 
gifts and commodities in relation to objects in the Pacific. 
</p>
<p>14 Harrison (1992) referred to 'Western intellectual property law' as 
though it is a single tradition. As discussed earlier, however, the legal 
treatment of intellectual property varies somewhat between Western 
legal systems. 
</p>
<p>15 Custom is also not adopted if a custom is 'repugnant to the general 
principles of humanity'. According to Nonggorr (1975:73), this 
repugnance test, which originated in British colonies in Mrica, was 
used by colonial governments in what is now Papua New Guinea to 
suppress local customs and institutions. An Underlying Law Bill 
prepared by the Law Reform Commission in 1976 proposed to 
remove this qualification. The repugnance test is not required for the 
application of common law. 
</p>
<p>16 Customary land, which includes more than 99 per cent of land in 
Papua New Guinea, is governed exclusively by customary law with 
disputes being settled through mediation or in Local Land Courts 
and District Land Courts (Nonggorr 1995:75-6).

Intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>leslie Harroun 
</p>
<p>&bull; In 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property refers to the products, processes or discoveries that 
result from the human intellect. Examples include: inventions, works of 
art, computer software, medical technologies, musical compositions, 
geographical indications, engineering devices, plant varieties and soft 
drinks. Intellectual property laws give the originators of such products, 
processes or discoveries a limited private property right in the fruit of 
their labour. These rights are granted by governments. Intellectual 
property shares many of the characteristics associated with real and 
personal property-it can be owned, bought, sold, licensed, exchanged 
or given away. The only difference is that intellectual property is intang-
ible; it cannot be defined or identified by physical parameters. None-
theless, it must be expressed in some discernible way to be protected. 
</p>
<p>When a government grants an inventor an intellectual property right, 
it is rewarding that person for his or her creativity and encouraging 
them to disclose their new information to others through commercial-
isation. The sharing of information leads to the development of useful 
new technologies. Without the benefit of legal protection that 
intellectual property rights provide-and the profit that may follow as a 
result-an inventor may not be willing to share his or her product for 
fear it will be stolen or misused to benefit others. When this happens, 
creativity is stifled. 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights are expensive to obtain and maintain and 
are usually secured by large corporations who have the resources to 
develop, establish and protect them. Few individuals hold intellectual 
</p>
<p>29 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>property rights. Thus, it is unlikely that intellectual property right 
regimes can provide the same benefits to developing countries that they 
do to industrial countries where large corporations have substantial 
resources to invest in technology development. 
</p>
<p>This chapter summarises the different classifications of intellectual 
property, what they protect and how, and their usefulness to Papua New 
Guinea today. 
</p>
<p>The rationale for intellectual property rights 
Formal intellectual property rights provide an incentive for innovation 
and the public disclosure of new information. These are essential 
elements for the development and dissemination of valuable new 
technologies, including those related to medicine, agriculture and 
science. People who share the fruits of their labour with society are 
thought to be deserving of economic reward, granted by the state on 
behalf of society. 
</p>
<p>By providing economic rewards, intellectual property rights promote 
creativity and the sharing of information in a number of related ways. 
First, they reward people who create commercial or cultural value. 
Giving the originators of innovations or discovery an exclusive right to 
market or make a profit from their work encourages creative endeavour. 
</p>
<p>Second, intellectual property rights allow people to own the fruit of 
their labour. If something novel and beneficial is produced, society may 
decide to reward the innovator with some form of ownership of his or 
her creation. Although this takes the invention out of the public domain 
and increases its price to others, it encourages people to be creative by 
placing a value on their effort and providing them with a return for their 
labour. 
</p>
<p>Third, by satisfYing the principles of moral or natural rights, 
intellectual property rights can give artists, inventors, traditional healers 
with biodiversity knowledge and other creative people a sense of 
parenthood toward their work or knowledge. This connection cannot be 
protected by traditional property rights because it is intangible. Yet, 
society can support this relationship by protecting it as intellectual 
property, thereby restricting the unauthorised use or destruction of 
useful inventions and knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Finally, intellectual property rights facilitate the acquisition and 
development of technology. The development and dissemination of new 
technologies is expensive and requires investment. Intellectual property

</div>

<p>Intellectual property rights in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>rights encourage the development of new technology by offering 
investors a way to obtain financial returns. This has particular relevance 
in Papua New Guinea where the high genetic diversity is valuable 
because it can result in the development of new medicines and crops. If 
an investment in Papua New Guinea's genetic resources leads to a new 
medicine which is then protected as intellectual property, Papua New 
Guinea could benefit from any profits made by the medicine, as well as 
from the medicine itself. Without intellectual property laws, the 
inventor of the medicine may choose not to export the medicine to 
Papua New Guinea because his or her ownership interest therein would 
not be protected there (Gollin and Laird 1996). 
</p>
<p>The classification of intellectual property rights 
There are five general categories of intellectual property in Euro-
American law-trade secrets, patents, plant breeder rights, copyrights 
and trademarks. Each reflects the laws of the country in which it is 
enacted. Rights established in one country may not be protected or even 
recognised in another. Similarly, intellectual property laws are not 
extraterritorial; they do not automatically apply outside the country in 
which they are law. Despite existing agreements that attempt to 
harmonise intellectual property laws throughout the world, substantive 
differences exist, especially in laws governing patentable subject matter. 
</p>
<p>Although there is no universal agreement on the legal rights that 
acctue under each type of intellectual property, most countries generally 
recognise at least those that protect innovative products or processes and 
those that protect the unique expression of ideas. 
</p>
<p>Protection of innovative products and processes 
Ideas, knowledge and know-how behind innovative products, processes 
and discoveries can be protected using trade secrets, patents and plant 
breeder rights. These types of rights give owners various rights of control 
over the use of their invention or discovery by others. 
</p>
<p>Trade secrets 
Trade secrets are used to retain control over, and to prevent the 
disclosure of, an original invention or process. They protect confidential 
information and methods that give their owner a competitive 
advantage. Trade secrets have the potential to protect traditional 
</p>
<p>31 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>knowledge of a medicinal plant, an extraction method handed down 
over generations or even taxonomic and ecological information and 
biological inventories (Gollin 1993). In order to be protected as a 
trade secret, an originator's information must 
&bull; be secret, in the sense that it is not generally known or accessible to 
</p>
<p>persons who normally deal with that kind of information 
&bull; have commercial value because it is secret 
&bull; be kept secret through the use of reasonable steps taken by the person 
</p>
<p>lawfully in control of the information. 
Because trade secrets require both secrecy and evidence of efforts to 
maintain that secrecy (such as keeping a recipe locked in a safe), they are 
difficult to establish, protect and enforce. Trade secrets last as long as the 
information remains unknown. They may be licensed, disclosed or 
assigned by their owner, but anyone who uses a trade secret without 
permission and to their own advantage may be liable to its originator for 
any resulting profits. If the information is discovered by disclosure (by 
the originator), by independent discovery, accidentally, or by reverse 
engineering the trade secret is permanently extinguished. 
</p>
<p>A considerable amount of indigenous peoples' knowledge may be 
protected by trade secrets, as long as the information has commercial 
value and provides a competitive advantage. Even if landowners do not 
wish to commercialise exclusive information themselves, they may 
restrict access to their land and exchange the information with outsiders 
only under confidentiality agreements to obtain economic benefit for 
their knowledge (Posey and Dutfield 1996). Papua New Guinea has no 
legislation governing trade secrets, although common law received from 
the United Kingdom at Independence may apply (Nonggorr 1990). 
</p>
<p>Patents 
</p>
<p>A patent gives an originator the right to exclude others from making, 
using or selling his or her product, process or discovery, usually for ten 
and twenty years. In order to be protected by a patent, an invention 
must exhibit several characteristics. 
&bull; Specific utility-it must be a useful product or process. Knowledge 
</p>
<p>itself, including ideas, theories and scientific formulas, is not 
patentable . 
</p>
<p>&bull; Novelty-the invention must be recent and original and cannot have 
been previously known, used, made, patented, described in print or 
in a previously filed patent anywhere. In most countries (except the 
</p>
<p>32 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Intellectual property rights in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>United States) the first person to apply for a patent receives it, 
whether or not she or he is the inventor. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Non-obviousness or inventiveness-even if an invention is novel, it 
may not be patented if its discovery amounts to an apparent or 
obvious outcome of the prior art (previously known skill) in the 
subject matter or field. Mere discoveries are not patentable. The 
invention must be disclosed in a manner so detailed that it would 
allow a skilled technician to make or use it. A patent for an invented 
process may cover a non-obvious way of making something already 
invented or discovered. Similarly, a patent for an invented product 
does not require that it be made by a novel method. 
</p>
<p>Patents are commonly regarded as providing superior protection to trade 
secrets because inventors of patentable products or processes disclose 
their inventions so that others may learn from them, and because 
inventors do not have to expend effort to protect their knowledge from 
use by others. While this may be true in industrial countries, trade 
secrets are easier to obtain, protect more indigenous knowledge and are 
less expensive to enforce by individuals or communities with few 
financial resources. In addition, patent protection does not last forever; 
once a patent expires the owner loses his or her exclusive rights. 
</p>
<p>Countries differ widely in the patent protection they offer for living 
material. For example, in the United States novel genes, DNA sequences, 
plant parts or varieties and biotechnological processes may receive patent 
protection if they meet the above requirements. On the other hand, 
many developing countries exempt medicines, biological processes and 
products and agricultural technologies entirely from their patent 
regimes. 1 One reason for this is to ensure public access to important 
inventions. However, such a restriction may prompt a foreign inventor 
not to export his or her technology to any country without patent 
protection, thereby reducing a developing country's access to that 
technology. In this situation, the developing country loses twice. While 
the diverse genetic resources of developing countries are exploited for 
biotechnology development-often with little financial gain-it is also 
the case that new technologies do not return to the country due to the 
lack of patent protection. In this way, lack of patent protection can 
severely limit the value of natural product development to a developing 
country (Axt et al. 1993).2 
</p>
<p>Some countries exempt biological processes from patent protection 
because they fear that a patent on a novel microbe, plant, cell line or 
purified compound will preclude people from using existing species or 
</p>
<p>33 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>practicing traditional methods of medicine or agriculture. This is not 
true. While a patent may remove a novel species from the public 
domain, the wild species from which it was created remains available for 
use by everyone (Gollin 1993). Papua New Guinea has no legislation 
governing patents. 
</p>
<p>Patents and indigenous knowledge 
</p>
<p>Patents cannot be obtained for the discovery of products of nature. 
Accordingly, wild habitats, species and raw biological materials cannot 
be patented. As a result, much potentially useful indigenous knowledge 
about the uses of plants is not patentable because it relies on the 
properties inherent in naturally occurring organisms. However, products 
or processes resulting from the development of biodiversity are 
patentable in some countries. Some inventive preparations of natural 
substances may be sufficiently novel to be patented, and the patent 
would provide protection for the knowledge as long as the individual or 
group applying for the patent can be cited as the inventor (Posey and 
Dutfield 1996; Gollin 1993). 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, patents are prohibitively expensive to obtain and 
enforce for most indigenous communities. A patent applicant must pay 
for the filing, examination and grant, which can amount to more than 
A$10,OOO-A$15,OOO for each country in which the patent is registered 
(Whimp 1997a). Even if a community were to obtain a patent, it would 
be difficult to enforce. First, they would have to have knowledge of a 
violation by an outside individual, group or corporation, and then they 
would have to bring legal action against the infringer. Finding effective 
legal support and the financial resources to do so would be a 
considerable hardship for most indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>Many pharmaceutical companies have investigated potentially useful 
attributes of plants used for medicinal purposes by traditional comm-
unities. In some cases, they have patented an isolated active principle of 
a biological substance and used it commercially. Although a patent 
cannot be obtained for a naturally occurring organism, a new synthetic 
compound based on it, which may be more stable or less toxic than the 
original substance, may be patentable (Posey and Dutfield 1996). 
</p>
<p>In cases where a corporation uses indigenous knowledge to identifY a 
useful substance without providing benefits, the local community can 
contest the patent. The community must show that the invention is 
</p>
<p>34 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Intellectual property rights in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>based on information acquired from the group and was used without 
their permission. In most countries, patent applications are available to 
the public before the patent is awarded. The mere threat of a challenge 
to a patent application is often enough to make corporations more 
willing to compensate indigenous communities for their knowledge. 
</p>
<p>An indigenous inventor may also publish a detailed description of 
how to make an invention, which then becomes part of the prior art that 
the patent office is obliged to search before awarding a patent. This is 
called defensive publication and can be used to prevent outsiders from 
patenting inventions derived from indigenous knowledge or resoutces. 
The problem is that the original inventor would have to isolate the 
active ingredient of the invention and publish the details. Publication 
may also attract companies interested in exploiting a new product, 
without necessarily compensating the originator (Posey and Dutfield 
1996). 
</p>
<p>Petty patents 
</p>
<p>Petty patents are similar to regular patents (otherwise known as utility 
patents) except qualification does not require the same level of 
inventiveness or non-obviousness. For example, a method for extracting a 
useful chemical from a plant in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea 
may be obvious given the international state of the art, but it may also 
be novel, useful and one step ahead of other methods. Petty patents are 
also less expensive to obtain because the patent examination process is 
either deferred or replaced by a registration system (Posey and Dutfield 
1996). 
</p>
<p>Petty patents are designed to reward and provide incentive for less 
sophisticated inventions or discoveries. As a result, it may be easier to 
protect indigenous rights to biodiversity knowledge with a petty patent 
system. Petty patents typically last for seven to ten years. 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, petty patents are only recognised within the country 
in which they are law; as yet there are no international agreements that 
recognise reciprocal rights to petty patents. One alternative for 
developing countries is to lower the standard of inventiveness for a 
utility patent in order to protect minor advances in technology and 
receive international recognition. However, though this may help 
protect traditional knowledge and local biodiversity, it may also open 
the door to substandard patents and remove useful products from the 
public domain (Gollin 1993).

<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Plant breeder rights 
</p>
<p>Most countries exclude living organisms from patent protection. Plant 
breeder rights allow exclusion from producing or selling propagating 
material of new plant varieties for a period of 15 to 30 years. Under the 
1961 international convention of the Union for the Protection of New 
Varieties of Plants, a breeder3 may earn the exclusive right to a novel 
plant variety if it is 
&bull; distinctive-distinguishable from other commonly known varieties by 
</p>
<p>one or more characteristics 
&bull; uniform-homogeneous with regard to its sexual reproduction or 
</p>
<p>vegetative propagation 
&bull; stable-remains true to its description after repeated reproduction 
</p>
<p>and propagation 
&bull; novel-not sold or marketed with the permission of the breeder in 
</p>
<p>the source country, or for longer than four years in any other country 
(Posey and Dutfield 1996). 
</p>
<p>Unlike patents, plant breeder rights allow the use of a protected variety 
for creating new varieties, for commercial exploitation and by farmers 
who wish to use their own harvested material to grow new crops on their 
own farms. For example, a farmer who purchased a protected plant 
variety could sell his or her crops commercially and plant new crops 
with the seeds produced from his or her harvest, but would be 
prohibited from selling the protected plant or its seeds. From this 
perspective, plant breeder rights are weaker than patents and would add 
little value to cultivars that come from wild habitats (Gollin and Laird 
1996; Gollin 1993). 
</p>
<p>Plant breeder rights establish strict requirements for breeding. A new 
variety bred from a wild plant would normally require several 
generations of breeding before becoming eligible for protection. In 
addition, plant breeder rights require financial resources, legal 
experience and scientific facilities to carry out field trials, record results 
and otherwise demonstrate eligibility. As a result, it has been more 
common for professional breeders than traditional farmer-breeders, to 
take advantage of these rights. This, and the fact that the Union for the 
Protection of New Varieties of Plants Convention has few member states, 
means that plant breeder rights have little relevance worldwide. Papua 
New Guinea does not have plant breeder rights legislation.

<p>Intellectual property rights in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Protection for the expression of ideas 
</p>
<p>Some types of intellectual property rights protect the unique expression 
of ideas, symbols or devices rather than the ideas themselves. There is no 
exclusion of the right to use the ideas, but they may not be copied in 
their original form without authorisation. Copyright, trademarks and 
certification marks are the main examples of this type of intellectual 
property right. 
</p>
<p>Copyright 
</p>
<p>Copyright laws protect original works of authorship against copying. 
They cover literary works, dramatic and musical works, works of applied 
arts and crafts, maps and technical drawings, photographs, motion 
pictures and sound recordings, computer programs, compilations of 
genetic data and information in databases. These works must be 
published in a tangible form (oral information is not protected unless a 
recording is made). Protection typically lasts 50 years beyond the life of 
the author. 
</p>
<p>Copyright protection only covers the author's particular expression of 
his or her work in a tangible medium. Protection does not extend to the 
idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, 
principle or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, 
explained or embodied. For example, it would not be a copyright 
infringement to reorganise data from a number of sources into a new 
compilation, but it probably would be an infringement to copy a 
compilation outright. Copyright owners have a legal right to prevent 
others from reproducing their work, performing their work in public, 
making a recording of their work and broadcasting, translating or 
adapting their work. 
</p>
<p>Copyright protection in Papua New Guinea could be used to stop 
people from copying traditional arts, crafts, songs, designs and other 
cultural symbols without permission and acknowledgment of the source, 
or from passing off replicas of indigenous art as genuine. Copyright 
protection would not protect folklore that is passed on orally from 
generation to generation, and would only protect written or recorded 
folklore for a limited time period. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, copyright is not overly useful for protecting genetic 
resources. Data collected about species may be subject to copyright 
</p>
<p>37 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>protection when included in publications or databases, but trade secrets, 
patents and plant breeder rights are more appropriate than copyright for 
protecting the genetic resources themselves. Copyright is assigned to 
individuals or companies, and so would have little use in protecting the 
rights of a community or clan. 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea passed copyright legislation in 1978, but it has 
never been implemented. The Copyright Act specifies that a work is not 
eligible for copyright unless deposit of the work has been made in terms 
of the Statutory Deposit Act of 1978. This latter Act was never passed. 
Depositories had to be identified, to hold all copyrighted works in the 
country before it could be passed, and the two potential depositories-
the National Library and the University of Papua New Guinea Library-
were unavailable due to lack of funding and staff. 
</p>
<p>Trademarks 
Trademarks prevent people from using confusingly similar words, 
names, symbols or devices in connection with the trade of goods to 
indicate who made the goods or provided the services and prevent 
deception and confusion in the marketplace. Trademarks protect the 
competitive advantage of providing a quality product or service, and 
ensure that the owners of a trademark obtain the profits associated with 
their product or service. 
</p>
<p>A trademark can last forever, but cannot be licensed or assigned apart 
from the goods or services it represents. Although trademarks do not 
have to be registered, doing so enables owners to license use and sue 
infringers. The Madrid Agreement Concerning the International 
Registration of Trademarks enables owners of trademarks to obtain 
coverage in multiple countries with a single application. Approximately 
thirty countries have signed this agreement (Posey and Dutfield 1996). 
</p>
<p>The artifacts and designs of indigenous peoples in Papua New Guinea 
are highly prized throughout the international market. Without 
trademark protection, indigenous people would have no recourse against 
those who make reproductions of their work and sell them as authentic. 
Consumers who value authenticity may choose to buy goods with an 
indigenous trademark even if they are more expensive than imitations. 
Some trademarks, such as the Body Shop, appeal to the ethical values of 
</p>
<p>38 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Intellectual property rights in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>consumers as well by indicating that the purchase of a particular good 
supports a specific social or environmental cause. In addition, trademarks 
may deter potential imitators by threat of legal action. 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea has trademark legislation (Trademarks Act, 
Chapter 385). Trademarks are registered by the Registrar of Trademarks, 
who operates from the Investment Promotion Authority. 
</p>
<p>Certification marks 
</p>
<p>Similar to a trademark, a certification mark is attached to goods to 
indicate a certain quality to consumers. Unlike trademarks, certifications 
are granted by independent public or private organisations rather than 
the entity marketing the product or service. Examples include the Good 
Housekeeping Seal of Approval or sustainable timber certifications. 
</p>
<p>Individual regions or organisations within Papua New Guinea could 
certifY that particular products, such as carvings authentic to a particular 
area of the Sepik or coffee grown by local villagers in the Crater Moun-
tain Wildlife Management Area, were obtained in a sustainable manner. 
Once certified, these products should enjoy a competitive advantage 
among consumers around the world simply because they are linked to 
sustainable development and are perceived as green (Gollin 1993). 
</p>
<p>Which intellectual property rights are suitable for 
local communities? 
No particular mechanism is ideally suited to collective ownership of 
traditional knowledge and biological resources. While some mechanisms 
are more suitable than others, they have all developed in a Western 
cultural and legal framework and are ill suited to this culturally different 
context. 
</p>
<p>International law and intellectual property rights 
There are several international agreements and treaties to which Papua 
New Guinea is a signatoty that require the implementation of 
intellectual property rights legislation. All are likely to affect the 
biological and cultural property rights of Papua New Guinea citizens. 
</p>
<p>39 </p>

<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity 
</p>
<p>In 1992, Papua New Guinea signed the Convention on Biological 
Diversity. This requires Papua New Guinea to develop plans, programs 
and policies to conserve and sustainably use its resources, to inventory 
and monitor national biodiversity, and to promote in situ and ex situ 
conservation. It also raises issues pertaining to cultural property rights, 
such as the protection of indigenous knowledge about medicinal 
resources and ownership rights to plant cultivars. 
</p>
<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity (Article 15(7&raquo; directs its 
parties to promote 'the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising 
out of the utilisation of genetic resources,' and to take measures to 
'respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of 
indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles 
relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity' 
(Article 80&raquo;. In effect, the Convention seeks to promote conservation 
and sustainable development, and establishes the principle of reciprocity 
between access to the genetic resources concentrated in developing 
countries and access to the advanced technologies of the industrial 
countries. It expects that such measures will include mechanisms to 
govern prior informed consent, benefit sharing and local community 
control before access to such resources is provided. 
</p>
<p>A number of countries have already passed laws which implement the 
Convention on Biological Diversity. These laws have the following 
protections in common 
&bull; they assert national sovereignty over biological resources within 
</p>
<p>national borders 
&bull; they require sample collectors to obtain prior informed consent, the 
</p>
<p>scope of which would be defined via a permitting process 
&bull; they require benefit sharing, payment or some other consideration to 
</p>
<p>the government as a condition of obtaining a collection permit. 
In addition, many national laws include provisions that (Laird 1995) 
&bull; establish a national biodiversity board or administering agency 
&bull; require that rights of prior informed consent and benefit sharing 
</p>
<p>extend to local communities 
&bull; encourage the transfer of technology 
&bull; require the use of contracts or materials transfer agreements for any 
</p>
<p>transfer of genetic materials which contain terms for benefit sharing 
and technology transfer

<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>&bull; require that any collection not endanger biological diversity 
&bull; require mechanisms to return benefits from exploitation to support 
</p>
<p>the conservation of biological diversity. 
The Convention on Biological Diversity provides international legal 
justification and a framework for Papua New Guinea to establish 
sovereignty over its genetic resources. It also encourages developing 
countries to implement intellectual property rights legislation. However, 
Western intellectual property models may be inappropriate and 
inadequate for Papua New Guinea at this point in time. 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights presume the desire and ability to 
commercialise products, processes or discoveries, which most indigenous 
people and communities do not possess. For many local communities in 
Papua New Guinea, art, songs, dances and plant knowledge represent 
more than intellectual property, and concepts of knowledge ownership 
are profoundly different from those of Western economics and 
jurisprudence. Traditional systems for sharing and transmitting 
knowledge and for regulating access to natural resources are extremely 
varied and most differ greatly from industrial societies. 
</p>
<p>While the language of the Convention on Biological Diversity and its 
associated agreements is vague regarding the rights of indigenous 
peoples, it provides an opportunity to define what those rights will be. 
As suggested by Posey and Dutfield (1996: 104) 
</p>
<p>Given that indigenous peoples are recognised as having specific rights and benefits 
and that economic livelihood is linked to development and conservation of natural 
resources, as much energy and effort as possible should be put into activating the 
sections relevant to indigenous rights--especially the recognition and protection o&pound; 
and compensation for, intellectual property. General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade negotiators, FAO, the WTO, and the World Intellectual Property 
Organisation will all have to accommodate to this reality in future because the vast 
majority of countries are signatories of the [Convention]. 
</p>
<p>Overall, the Convention on Biological Diversity provides a framework 
that can help boost Papua New Guinea's negotiating strength in 
situations involving access to and development of its genetic and 
biochemical resources. However, Papua New Guinea has yet to 
incorporate the Convention into domestic policies or legislation. This 
means that under foreign property rights laws, biological resources still 
constitute common knowledge and are open to all. Through the 
Convention on Biological Diversity, Papua New Guinea now has the 
opportunity to develop the policies and legislation needed to achieve the 
</p>

<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Intellectual property rights in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>benefits possible through development of its natural and cultural 
resources. 
</p>
<p>The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
</p>
<p>Agreement 
</p>
<p>The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement is 
an international agreement entered into under the framework of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to which Papua New Guinea is 
a signatory. It requires Papua New Guinea to meet minimum standards 
for protecting patents, copyright, trademarks and trade secrets and other 
related rights within a period of five to ten years. 
</p>
<p>The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement 
is perhaps the most ambitious multilateral agreement to regulate 
intellectual property in the world. It incorporates provisions of the Paris 
Convention, the Berne Convention, and other international intellectual 
property treaties, and is based on the recognition that failure to provide 
adequate and effective intellectual property protection is a barrier to 
legitimate trade.4 The Agreement extends national treatment and most 
favoured nation treatment to countries with intellectual property 
protection. 
</p>
<p>The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement 
has been strongly criticised by proponents of indigenous rights. They 
argue that developing countries are being pressured into accepting 
protection of plant genetic resources and limitations to access which are 
contrary to many customary practices of sharing seeds and community 
innovation. This is particularly true for plant breeder rights, which have 
the potential to encourage monocultures over in situ conservation and 
lead to negative implications for biodiversity. Yet within the Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement there is an 
opportuniry to develop a sui generis (one of a kind) system for the 
protection of plant varieties that could serve the interests of local 
communities. In addition, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights Agreement excludes plants and animals from 
patentability, except for microoganisms and biological processes for the 
production of plants or animals (Article 27.3(b&raquo;, and allows countries 
to prohibit the patenting of commercial inventions that would lead to 
serious environmental prejudice (Article 27.2). In any event, it is 
possible under international law for indigenous people to demand that 
</p>
<p>43 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>governments prohibit multinational corporations from patenting plant 
and animal material found on their lands, 
</p>
<p>Countries considering implementation of both the Tr;:tde-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement and the Convention 
on Biological Diversity should examine how the two sets of laws 
interact. For example, if Papua New Guinea is interested in promoting 
natural product development it should consider greater patent 
protection for biotechnology inventions than the Trade-Related Aspects 
of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement requires. It should also 
consider enacting such legislation now rather than waiting the allowed 
five or ten years. 
</p>
<p>The World Intellectual Property Organisation 
</p>
<p>The World Intellectual Property Organisation, established in 1967, 
promotes international protection of intellectual property and facilitates 
international transfers of technology, Papua New Guinea became a 
member of the World Intellectual Property Organisation in November 
1996. 
</p>
<p>As a United Nations specialised agency, the World Intellectual 
Property Organisation administers several multilateral intellectual 
property treaties, including the Paris Convention for the Protection of 
Industrial Property (1883), the Berne Convention for the Protection of 
Literary and Artistic Works (1886), the Madrid Agreement Concerning 
the International Registration of Trademarks (1891), and the Patent 
Cooperation Treaty (1970). The World Intellectual Property 
Organisation also provides assistance to signatory nations seeking to 
enact intellectual property laws and attempts to harmonise national laws 
throughout the world. 
</p>
<p>Conclusion 
Intellectual property rights are useful to protect the products, processes 
and discoveries of human creativity and to encourage technological 
innovation. They become important when individuals (and 
corporations) want to make a commercial profit from their innovation or 
discovery. From this perspective, they protect purely economic interests. 
They are difficult, time consuming and expensive to obtain. Once 
secured they often have to be defended. They require elaborate national 
</p>
<p>44 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Intellectual property rights in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>legal and regulatory institutions, including a patent and trademark 
office, copyright registry and a court system able to handle intellectual 
property cases. These all require substantial commitments of national 
funds and expertise. 
</p>
<p>Most developing countries do not have the resources to obtain or 
protect these economic rights, and therefore are unable to benefit from 
them even if recognised as law. In fact, most indigenous people and local 
communities would be put at a disadvantage relative to multinational 
corporations and other biodiversity end users if they tried to protect 
their knowledge and resources by employing these rights. Intellectual 
property rights are generally inappropriate and ineffective for defending 
traditional knowledge and resource rights, which are in large part linked 
to rights of self-determination. Fortunately, a number of alternative 
strategies for protecting indigenous knowledge and resources are 
emerging based on sui generis rights and restricted access to traditional 
cultural and biological resources. 
</p>
<p>Like most developing countries, Papua New Guinea has tremendous 
human and natural resources to nurture and promote . .fu a signatory to 
the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, 
the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the Convention on 
Biological Diversity, Papua New Guinea must make some immediate 
decisions about what types of intellectual property rights it wishes to 
embrace. It must think carefully about the impacts of each intellectual 
property right regime on economic policy, technology transfer, 
indigenous rights and biological diversity. It must make sure that its 
objectives are clearly incorporated into legislation and that they clearly 
address sources of conflict among these conventions. Papua New Guinea 
is a unique country and has the ability to define its own future-using 
intellectual property rights and sui generis rights wisely and creatively 
can help Papua New Guinea realise its future.

<p>Notes 
</p>
<p>1 A number of countries do not allow patents for pharmaceutical 
compounds or compositions: Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Ghana, 
Honduras, Hungary, India, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, 
Monaco, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Syria, Tangier Zone, Thailand, 
Tunisia and Turkey, Even more countries restrict patents for 
biotechnological processes and products: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, 
Denmark, European Patent Office, Finland, Great Britain, Hungary, 
India, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Romania, 
South Mrica, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, 
Uruguay and Yugoslavia (Gollin 1993, citing Baxter and Sinnot 
1992). 
</p>
<p>2 Some people argue that the privatisation of the biotechnology 
industry and the recognition of property rights in biotechnology 
hinder access to these technologies by developing countries, who 
most need the benefits, presumably by making the cost of such 
technology exorbitant. For this reason, it is sometimes argued that 
intellectual property laws are irrelevant or even detrimental for 
developing countries (Dembo et al. 1985:431, 444 (note 62), 450-2). 
</p>
<p>3 Under the 1991 revision of the Union for the Protection of New 
Varieties of Plants, a breeder is a person who breeds, discovers or 
develops new crop varieties. 
</p>
<p>4 The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property 
(1883) directs that signatories must accord foreign patent and 
trademark applicants and owners the same treatment and rights as 
domestic patentees, although it does not grant any substantive 
international intellectual property rights. The Berne Convention for 
the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886) establishes 
international standards for copyright protection. Member nations 
must provide protection for all copyrighted material, with minimal 
requirements for notice and registration, making copyright the 
simplest universal intellectual property rights system in the world. 
Papua New Guinea is not a signatory to either of these conventions, 
but will be required to adopt legislation that complies with them in 
order to meet its obligations as a member of the World Trade 
Organisation.

Multiple perspectives on 
</p>
<p>intellectual property 
</p>
<p>Marilyn Strathern 
</p>
<p>The concept of intellectual property has opened up possibilities for the 
legal protection of rights to intangible resources, including the products 
of knowledge and other forms of creativity. It has thus become one 
possible route to recognising the holders of the 'knowledge, innovations 
and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying tradit-
ional lifestyles relevant for the conservation of and sustainable use of

Convention leaves it open as to how signatory nations are to respond but 
cautions them over intellectual property rights agreements lest these run 
counter to rather than support its objectives (Article 16.5). 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property has suddenly become a topic of widespread 
international interest. Moreover, once articulated, it rapidly catches the 
public imagination, and this is something to be taken into account in 
policy development. What makes it such a powerful and debatable 
topic? The first part of this chapter suggests it is important to under-
stand the Euro-American culture which has produced the intellectual 
property concept as well the cultures which may adopt it. Assumptions 
and practices originating from northern Europe and North America 
inform many values that the international community takes for granted. 
Less obvious is the fact that these include some of the ways in which not 
just support of but opposition to intellectual property rights has been 
expressed. Further, Euro-American culture, like any other, is constantly 
changing, and stereotypes get out of step with current social realities. 
These offer points for debate in the second part of the chapter.

<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>One approach to weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of 
intellectual property rights is contained in the very notion of property. 
At the heart of Euro-American ideas lies a creative ambiguity: on the 
one hand property refers to things and on the other hand to social 
relations (Hann 1997). Things mayor may not be tangible; property is 
equally the thing in which a person holds rights and those rights 
themselves. In the second sense, property points to a set of relations 
between persons with respect to a thing, for claims are always made by 
persons in relation to others and within a field of relationships which 
recognise those claims. Thus the Convention on Biological Diversity has 
created a new arena in which rights may be negotiated. These terms 
(things and relations) are useful more generally as points of entry into 
the debate. As the Papua New Guinean material shows, however, they 
are useful only up to a point, and the third part of the chapter touches 
briefly on Papua New Guinean concepts of property. 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights: global resources and 
protection for people 
Intellectual property rights cannot be ignored as a tool in international 
law, but why are intellectual property rights a global issue? What public 
expectations do they raise? The hope for new raw materials, the thought 
of new ways to gain from old ones, and perhaps even the idea that if one 
lost out in earlier distributions of resources, here one can be in at the 
beginning, and the recognition of diverse actors in the field all play their 
part.! 
</p>
<p>New things: new products 
Competition is one impetus to create new economic products. Resource 
hunting by companies for usable products and new uses leads to the 
discovery of new materials (things) to which economic value can be 
attached; biotechnology companies may rate success in terms of 
numbers of patents. This contributes to the pace of technological 
innovations in the industrialised world, and the commercial expectation 
that anything exploitable should be exploited alerts people to hitherto 
unseen possibilities. 
</p>
<p>New inventions lead to value being put on both the inventive 
capacity itself and the knowledge behind it. Intellectual property rights 
encourage inventors to spread their knowledge (rather than keeping it 
</p>

<p/>

</p>
<p>secret) once they have secured recognition. Intellectual property rights 
can thus be applied to things still in the making-it is possible to 
patent a manufacturing process as well as a product, and that may come 
to cover uses as yet unanticipated. In pointing to future economic 
potential, it appeals to the imagination. In effect it invites people to ask 
how they can put their knowledge to future use. 'Prospecting' of all 
kinds is characterised by a high degree of awareness that change signals 
more change. Provision is made for the uncertainty of what will be an 
asset in the future. Many things hold potential. The question behind 
patenting-whose knowledge was put to use?-alerts people to putting 
value on what might be useful. 
</p>
<p>New ways of thinking about existing products emerge. Value pur on 
knowledge as a resource and on the acknowledgment of creativity in 
authorship leads to reflection on knowledge already made useful, and thus 
already embedded in artifacts (design), persons (in the form of intention2 
</p>
<p>and transferable skills) and practices (medical remedies). Such knowledge 
(for example, ethnobotanical classifications) may be an aid to future 
discoveries or, in coming to be valued in its own right, evokes what is 
already in place. The general idea of cultural property as embedded 
knowledge is a prime example. The question behind copyright-who is 
the original author?-raises expectations about assigning property rights 
to all kinds of products attributable to past human creativity. 
</p>
<p>New relations: new social actors 
</p>
<p>The widespread consensus that economic growth is key to the survival of 
political institutions such as the state underwrites agreements endorsing 
national sovereignties. Nation states are not new, but the kinds of 
relations that state agencies have with aboriginal peoples (,first nations') 
as well as with transnational corporations are being constantly 
refashioned. Intellectual property rights flourish in a social context 
energised by the relationship of national innovation to globalisation-
will national interests get increasingly competitive or dissolve in the face 
of multinational and other conglomerates? The phenomenon of 
interlinked economies shows persistent national differences as the 
driving force behind the globalisation of technology (Bartholomew 
1997).3 The expectation that national interests are people's interests is 
written into many inter(trans)national agreements. 
</p>
<p>Agreement that the protection of property rights is an issue of 
worldwide concern is embedded in organisations (such as non govern-

<p/>
</div>

</p>
<p>ment organisations) and social instruments beyond the state. The former 
disseminate information and thus act as knowledge brokers across 
national boundaries. The latter include ways of dealing with access to 
and protection of resources beyond an exclusively national perspective, 
including soft law regulations. 4 They create expectations both of free 
movement (for example, knowledge of what other groups are doing) and 
of regulation (international agreements) beyond the state. 
</p>
<p>Acknowledgment that human rights make it necessary to single out 
categories such as indigenous peoples and women assists the 
formalisation of interest groups.5 This has created unprecedented 
possibilities for enfranchising local interests through a global identity 
(indigenous groups mayor may not be coterminous with the nation). 
</p>
<p>Expectations of intellectual property rights are played out in advocacy 
and opposition. Both enthusiasm for and criticism of intellectual 
property rights touch equally on property thought of as a thing and 
property thought of as rights between persons with respect to a thing. 
</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for intellectual property rights: advocacy 
Things. Intellectual property rights are seen as a legal instrument that 
will allow indigenous communities to assert claims on the international 
stage in a manner hardly yet possible.6 The very idea of intellectual 
property lends itself to all kinds of creativity. What helps technology 
also helps indigenous activists who have in the past struggled for a voice 
</p>
<p>Indigenous knowledge, historically scorned by the world of industrial societies, has 
now become intensely, commercially attractive ... At bottom, intellectual property 
rights consist of efforts to assert access to, and control over, cultural knowledge and 
to things produced through its application. [Among those who 1 seek equity for the 
world's indigenous peoples the thought arises, why couldn't indigenous peoples 
own their cultural knowledge, and then, if they allow it to be used elsewhere, secure 
a just share of the money it generates (Greaves 1994: ix, 4). 
</p>
<p>Relations. Intellectual property rights are premised on a sense of equity, 
the two-way flow of knowledge and recompense. They do not just create 
a legal arena to protect rights, they give power to new social actors, that 
is, the legal 'person' identified as inventor or author in whom the 
property rights are invested? Such persons are legally individuals 
('juridical persons'), a concept which can include corporate bodies such 
as government agencies or research institutes. Any social unit-
individual, clan or village-could theoretically seek registration as a 
juridical person and thus as a potential right holder.

<p>Multiple perspectives on intellectual property 
</p>
<p>Criticism of intellectual property rights: opposition 
</p>
<p>Things. Not everything can be considered as a thing to be owned, for in 
Euro-American thinking, ownership implies the right of alienation 
(disposing of the thing to another, for example, through sale or as a gift). 
The question of what can and cannot be alienated is often answered in 
terms of the kind of thing at issue. Thus many Euro-Americans regard 
nature as a common resource for humankind that should not be 
allocated to specific owners. The question then focuses on exactly what 
nature is. 
</p>
<p>When the European Parliament in July 1997 debated a directive for 
the legal protection of biotechnological inventions to give companies the 
right to patent organisms created through microbiological processes, one 
opponent referred to this as 'a charter to enslave nature'. Organisms are 
not appropriately owned in this thinking, nor is 'life'. This comes from a 
Euro-American preoccupation with things as objects of manipulation; 
any entity that is a person (subject) or of human material or simply 
animate may be protected from object-like status. It also comes from the 
idea of nature as a resource to be freely shared. To assert property rights 
is to diminish the commons (resources from which no one is by right 
excluded). 
Social relations. The question of what can and cannot be alienated is 
answered in terms of people's relationships with one another. 
Opponents of intellectual property rights may see them as asserting a 
form of private property that challenges the ethos of sharing that they 
would attribute to collective ownership typical of indigenous 
communities. Generations of people are responsible for building up 
cultural knowledge. Not to acknowledge this is to deny people's cultural 
and inalienable heritage. 
</p>
<p>Contemporary intellectual property law is constructed around the notion of the 
author as an individual, solitary and original creator ... Those who do not fit this 
mode-custodians of tribal culture and medical knowledge, collectives practising 
traditional artistic and musical forms, or peasant cultivators of valuable seed 
varieties-are denied intellectual property protection. For members of indigenous 
peoples, knowledge and determination of the use of resources are collective and 
intergenerational (Bellagio and COl CA statements, Posey 1996b: 13). 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights seem a poor social register and may even 
set people against one another. If the identification of individual authors 
or inventors becomes problematic in light of traditional authorship and 
collective inventions, then the identification of individual property

</p>
<p>holders becomes problematic in the light of multiple claims, Even if a 
group can be identified, who belongs to the group? Who is the 
representative to speak on its behalf? What about power inequalities 
between different interests within the group? 
</p>
<p>Points for debate 
Intellectual property rights are derived from Euro-American culture, 
Euro-American critics themselves emphasise this, and seize on 
individualism and private property as the principal problems, Some 
evoke an older European vocabulary through appeal to community and 
practices of sharing in the free transmission of knowledge. This 
vocabulary seems to mesh well with similar criticisms that come from 
communities proclaiming traditional rights or different kinds of 
relations with nature. One might conclude that these criticisms indicate 
how to put indigenous culture on the map.8 If Papua New Guinea is to 
identifY itself with indigenous and traditional values, then it might 
already have the tools for a Papua New Guinea response. But perhaps 
the conclusion is premature, for it does not follow that current criticisms 
of intellectual property rights automatically indicate a Papua New 
Guinea way. Debate about these issues should question the assumptions 
behind the way intellectual property rights are opposed, as well as those 
by which it is supported. 
</p>
<p>Euro-American ambiguity towards property (see the Annex at the 
end of this chapter) fuels both enthusiasm and antagonism towards 
intellectual property rights. Attacks on individualistic notions of 
property echo the kinds of criticism Euro-Americans make of their own 
practices. For 300 years they have railed against the individualistic 
connotations of property, and drawn on their own ideas of its opposite 
(communal forms of ownership) in order to do so. In the case of 
intellectual property, nineteenth century protesters resisted the idea that 
knowledge can be treated as property. This was regarded in Europe as 
both a practical and moral matter. The flow of ideas could not be 
controlled, but equally importantly, 'ideas are in essence free goods and, 
therefore, common property' (Brush 1993:655). Common property is 
equated not with collective identity but with unrestricted access. 
</p>
<p>Much critique was directed towards property as private and exclusive 
ownership, though one should note that the concept of property as a 
bundle of rights always allowed the recognition of multiple rights. One 
alternative to intellectual property rights which has recei~ed support 
</p>
<p>52 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Multiple perspectives on intellectual property 
</p>
<p>from several quarters-traditional resource rights-adopts the bundle of 
rights idea (Posey 1996b; Posey and Dutfield 1996). This argues that 
resources can be best protected through recognising the diverse, 
overlapping principles embodied in multiple instruments and 
agreements that reflect whole bundles of different rights (for example, 
the right to self-determination, cultural heritage rights and the right to 
privacy), of which intellectual property rights form only one. 
</p>
<p>In the late twentieth century, Euro-American culture fuels the way in 
which much of the international community approaches both the 
exploitation of resources and the remedies to this. It provides both the 
language for the notion of intellectual property and a language for 
resistance. Across the world bodies have debated the utility of 
intellectual property rights in terms of the kinds of communal rights 
that should be asserted against those of individual ownership and the 
extent to which commodification (making things marketable) 
undermines the free sharing of resources. Euro-American assumptions 
about authorship and individuality have been attacked, and one 
welcomes the new international consensus that points to other ways of 
defining rights, notably the idea of collective rights. But does the model 
of collective rights have to be that of communal rights, and does the 
counterpoint to commodity have to be the sharing of resources? 
</p>
<p>This is not just an academic matter; there is a real need for a 
contemporary view. First, the things over which companies and nations 
compete are constantly changing and thus so are the kinds of rights 
people seek. If genetic material turns into an informational resource 
which can be used over and again without diminution (like a 
performance), its new character creates new problems and possibilities 
for asserting property rights (Parry 1997)-how do you keep track of 
multiple transactions? 
</p>
<p>Second, social realities are changing all the time, and stereotypes get 
out of date. It would be a mistake to stereotype all commercial firms as 
monolithic capitalist enterprises like armies out to occupy new terrains. 
For many, a better analogy would be the flexible and adaptable guerrilla 
who would seize opportunities but not wait around for them; whose 
dependence on raw materials may be no more than an initial step in a 
long process; who would be able to transform products to the extent 
that the original creators are left far behind. An exaggeration perhaps, 
but international organisations in technology development (where 
intellectual property rights remain significant) operate at diverse levels, 
</p>
<p>53 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>for example, integrating basic and applied research between firms and 
research institutions. Companies do not just act as competitive 
individuals. Knowledge transfer becomes a new item of transaction, 
and alliances are established and communication networks are 
created.9 
</p>
<p>In sum, it would be a pity if particular Euro-American views of 
community and sharing led to definitions of practices that do not in the 
long run help in dealing with outside interests. These views pose their 
own problems-what might sound well in international debate may 
create unanswerable internal questions (including those concerned with 
what a community is and who has the right to share). Finally, we need 
to look at Papua New Guinea as is, not as defined in advance by the 
international community. So is there a Papua New Guinea way? 
</p>
<p>Transactions in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>What is property in Papua New Guinea? 
</p>
<p>This question could result in a huge matrix depicting all the kinds of 
things in which people have rights (for example, land, decorations, 
tankets10 and pigs), alongside the relations involved, both the nature of 
the right (ownership, possession, stewardship or usufruct) and the 
categories of social person who may be right holders (chief, clan, sister or 
individual). Within the matrix, one would find rights to intangibles as 
the product of intellectual or creative effort-magical spells, habits 
purchased from seniors, rights of entry into grade associations, 
malanggan designs (where it is not the figures but the images that 
circulate), as well as myth, songs sung on particular occasions and ritual 
styles (Harrison 1992). But there are many songs, styles, and indeed, 
whole areas of knowledge that one would not consider property in the 
same way. And there are many ways in which persons exercised rights in 
relation to one another that one would not necessarily wish to call 
property rights. What is the difference? 
</p>
<p>Some would say the question is pointless. In this view the very idea of 
property seems inappropriate to the Papua New Guinea situation-
everything is implicated in everything else, and property simply distorts 
the holistic nature of indigenous realities. Although there is truth to this 
view, there would be some use in developing a counterpart to the 
international term 'property'. 
</p>
<p>54 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Multiple perspectives on intellectual property 
</p>
<p>The Papua New Guinea situation throws into relief the limitation of 
focusing only on things (items in which people have rights) or on 
relations (how those rights are held between persons). This focus can of 
course be developed to allow for multiple rights; it can be stretched to 
accommodate so-called forms of communal property. But it forces 
attention onto the identity of the things (such as sacred sites and 
botanical knowledge) or the identity of the social persons claiming 
rights (the clan as a right holder or the individual who claims usufruct), 
and moreover onto identity already established (as when people say that 
long-standing community values are threatened by property claims). A 
third dimension also demands attention. 
</p>
<p>Property through transactions? 
</p>
<p>Perhaps one answer to the question of what constitutes property in 
Papua New Guinea is that there is property where there has been a 
transaction. Papua New Guinean practices introduce the idea that rights 
may be defined by the process of transaction itself. This perspective 
would bring Papua New Guinea closer to international understandings 
of contract. It would also deal with a crucial dimension of Papua New 
Guinea social reality. Many things (tangible and intangible) are 
regarded as derived from other persons-creativity or knowledge 
frequently passes from one person to another, so that a person has rights 
by virtue of his relations with other persons. This includes the life and/ 
or body that, in some societies, a mother's brother gives to his sister's 
children. This does not just mean that a person holds right of possession 
against other persons or by virtue of courts of law to uphold them. It 
means that the possession is itself created out of social relationships 
because the thing in which the rights are exercised embodies that 
relationship. Euro-Americans may think in similar terms but do not 
build the kind of social practices out of them that are found in Papua 
New Guinea. Two sets of practices are relevant here. 
</p>
<p>The first comes from the familiar case of multiple rights. A right may 
be invested in the individual but the individual is embedded in 
relationships. Land holding is a common example. For the case of 
intellectual products, consider a carved design owned by X by virtue of 
the fact that X belongs to clan Y. The design is also owned by the clan, 
even though no other clan members may exercise that right on an 
individual basis till the right holder dies. Alternately the carving may 
</p>
<p>55 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>have been derived from inspiration inculcated by a master (Kasaipwalova 
1975). What typifies such rights is that they are exercised in specific 
contexts. Often the social relations (for example, clan membership or 
apprenticeship) are made evident at the same time as the right is. Pre-
existing identities are not sufficient. If people have the right to 
perform certain acts, such as mortuary service, this is held in relation 
to specific others (for example, the deceased's kin), and is realised only 
in their company on that specific occasion. The right of a mother to 
eat the bridewealth pig for a daughter may affect none of her claims 
over pigs until the occasion when that right is mobilised by the 
relationships brought into play at marriage. The thing produced or the 
performance enacted embodies relationships-the bridewealth pig is a 
vehicle for the relationships the mother has with both her daughter and 
with her in-laws; an artist and his ancestors together produce an image, 
and the (making of the) image itself incorporates that relationship. 
However, the extent to which such relationships entail overt 
'transactions' varies. 
</p>
<p>The second, the extent to which rights are defined by having 
something to dispose, is less familiar outside Papua New Guinea. It may 
also be the case that within Papua New Guinea it is more salient in 
some regions than in others. In the Western Highlands the ability to 
pass something on may be circumscribed (for example, a man may gift a 
pig where a woman cannot) but nonetheless be a prerogative. The 
converse is acquisition, where the ability to acquire rests not in the 
nature of the thing but in the relationship between parties agreeing to 
the transactability of the item (like contracts). The grounds may be 
those of recompense (as in exchange or donation), kinship (as in 
inheritance), learning (as when a junior gains knowledge from a senior), 
intent (in preparing a garden) or inspiration (as when someone dreams a 
design). While these are based on prior relationships, the relationships 
have built into them an expectation of transaction or disposability. One 
might talk of the right to endow, as when one group of men endows 
another with a woman in marriage-for the right to endow (so to speak) 
usually carries the benefit of eliciting a counter-endowment (for 
example, sister exchange). Claims mayor may not be exclusive; in some 
cases a crucial component of Xs acquisition of things is the fact that he 
or she obtained them from B. There may be a coercive element-
transactions lead to transactions, solicitory gifts to return gifts; plants in 
the ground belong to the planter but are intended for another who has 
</p>
<p>56 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Multiple perspectives on intellectual property 
</p>
<p>exclusive rights of consumption. The same things are disposable in some 
situations and not in others. The point is that things may embody 
relationships as the process of attachment and detachment. Sillitoe 
(1998) refers to the right of disposal-we might consider this a property 
relation. 
</p>
<p>Some corollaries for intellectual property 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinean knowledge and creativity is both embedded and 
transactable. Perhaps we should be looking for conditions of transaction 
(not forgetting that exclusion or inclusion-property-may work here as 
anywhere else). The above leads to much misunderstood practices of 
reciprocity; reciprocity is entailed precisely because one party involves 
another. It is not itself inherently virtuous. But it means that there is no 
simple confrontation between communal versus individual rights-we are 
dealing with specific interests embedded in relations between persons. 
</p>
<p>That things reifY relations is often misunderstood as mercenary 
interest. If there is value in transforming human relations into things 
which can be transacted, does this entail a right Gust as the 
international community transforms relations into documents, often 
under scrupulously adjudicated circumstances)? This is not just sharing 
versus commodification. If technological process is criticised (as, for 
example, in the case of the commodified seed that does not reproduce 
(Shiva 1992)), what about reproduction through transactions as such? 
The right to reproduce may entail the right to bestow (,life' and 'body', 
in the form of things, on future generations). 
</p>
<p>The idea of relations transactable in things leads to a proliferation of 
compensation practices (Filer 1997). Opponents of intellectual property 
rights may claim that one cannot identifY the individual author under 
indigenous regimes where innovations are cumulative, and then attack 
the whole idea of payment. But payment in Papua New Guinea 
precisely means making intangibles tangible. The question is what you 
can and cannot make material. Payment for intellectual property is 
criticised for imposing the Euro-American split of mind from body, as 
in the transformation of community economies to market ones. But 
where there is no division between persons and things, then the practice 
of eliciting specific knowledge or assets through the payment of things 
may be a sui generis mode of dealing with relations between persons. Of 
course it may lend itself to market forms, and to successful or 
unscrupulous behaviour. Nonetheless there are interesting hints for

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>looking at international conventions of contract and further research is 
needed. 
</p>
<p>These observations about transactions in Papua New Guinea are 
somewhat tentative and speculative. They mayor may not be useful in 
the present context. It remains the case, nonetheless, that whatever place 
intellectual property rights hold in people's imagination and 
expectations, transactions will play a major part. 
</p>
<p>If getting instruments in place to divert the Convention on Biological 
Diversity protocols into local channels is difficult, the potential of 
compensation as an enabler of a modernised indigenous order promises 
to burst the banks. Its power lies in the very way in which equivalences 
are set up between human values (persons and relations) and things. 
There will be no problem about sweeping into the arena of 
compensation practices all manner of inventions and innovations. This is 
not because there is no clear distinction between work and resources or 
between control over knowledge and rights established through the 
exertions of those to whom one is related. Rather, the issue is the power 
of transactions to define interests in resources-for those transactions in 
turn expand people's capacity for social relationships, whether between 
the transacting parties or in relation to others, offering both old and new 
bases for power relations. 
</p>
<p>There is opportunity for a fresh look at intellectual property rights as 
at once an enablement and a problem. Many critiques about 
individualism and commercialism reinvent old sources of Euro-
American criticism. They are as valuable, and as limited, as the notions 
of property that they seek to modity. The Papua New Guinea way would 
be to add richness, complexity and a different kind of realism to both 
sides of the debate.

</p>
<p>Diverse perspectives on Euro-American ideas about property 
</p>
<p>Property has carried radically different connotations at different 
moments in European history (Hann 1997). For example, Roman law, 
foundational in many continental European countries, identified 
ownership with the thing owned. Property was capable of infinite 
division, as in peasant Europe, where landholdings would be divided 
into smaller and smaller parcels among heirs. Things were thus divided 
between persons by being split into shares. Title inhered in the thing 
owned (for example, an estate) to which persons became attached, and 
only certain things were regarded as property (movable or immovable 
goods). Communal property comes from the idea of persons held 
together by common bonds in a piece of property which they share. 
</p>
<p>Compare common law, as practised in England, following feudal 
holdings, which rendered the thing indivisible so what was divided was 
rights among people. Thus things are not divided: rights in them are, 
and anyone thing might have several owners. People could thus buy 
and sell rights in things without altering the thing itself, a system that 
allowed intangible entities such as copyright and patents to be regarded 
as forms of property. Since the right inhered in the individual person, 
this was also the precursor of private property. Private property entails 
the right to exclude others, and common property, the individual's right 
not to be excluded. 
</p>
<p>Nineteenth century objections to private property (capital) derived 
from longstanding debates over labour; if people have a right to enjoy 
the products of their labour, when labour can be bought and sold, what 
rights has the new 'owner' gained? One response: the wage labourer sells 
his time, but his person remains free. Counter-response: labour is 
already defined as on the market; the labourer is not free to dispose of 
his or her labour otherwise. Models of communal enterprises to which 
people instead contributed their collective efforts was one solution to 
this impasse. 
</p>
<p>Property is tied up with specific political as well as economic systems, 
for example, protection of individual rights within a state system. What 
protects one person (claims to the usable products of their activities) 
may exploit others (disregard for other kinds of claims). It is the double-
edged character of property (protection for this person, exclusion of

<p>that) that makes it at once a highly moral and highly dubious construct. 
Throughout modern European history property has been a source of 
indigenous (European) contest. 
</p>
<p>Many twentieth century Euro-Americans are concerned about 
commodification. Part of the above politics has been the human rights 
insistence that persons should not be treated like property. Property is 
bound up with social identity, whether corporate (as in attachment to 
estates) or individual (authorship). It is when it comes to buying and 
selling that some things are properly regarded as alienable and some as 
not. A person may have title but still be restricted as to how to dispose 
of property (including, for example, the restrictions posed by 
inheritance laws), but the issue of monetary gain adds a further 
dimension to what are perceived as sometimes acute moral dilemmas. 
The European Community biotechnology directive led to an outcry at 
the point when it seemed to be sanctioning the commodification of 
human material. Embryo research and the 'ownership' of organs and 
body parts interfere with European notions of 'life'. It is interesting that 
one solution to thinking about rights in embryos outside the body 
(created through reproductive technology) has been that of dispositional 
control-rights in disposal (Robertson 1994). 
</p>
<p>Notes 
1 Perhaps much activity from former colonial states gains impetus from 
</p>
<p>what are perceived to be past inequities to be rectified rather than 
from a realistic estimation of current realities. Compare the 
'futuristic' connotations of bioprospecting with the whole issue over 
the protection of food varieties, especially in grain-growing countries 
(Shiva 1992). 
</p>
<p>2 American litigation over parental rights in the context of new 
reproductive technology has, by analogy with intellectual property 
rights, included attempts to establish a claim through the 'intention' 
to reproduce. 
</p>
<p>3 Diversity of national policies and regulations flourishes. Attempts by 
the European Community in 1997 to harmonise laws of member 
states relating to biotechnology is a case in point. The United States 
is particularly typified by increasing protectionist legislation for 
intellectual assets.

such documents are not legally binding, there is a strong expectation 
that they will be respected by the international community. The 
evolution of customary international law is accelerated by including 
customary principles in soft law agreements and non-governmental 
declarations; these become hardened through worldwide acceptance 
(Posey and Dutfield 1996:120).

<p>6 But the number of cases where this has happened successfully is 
small. For example, it would be possible for tribal rights to a folk 
variety of plant to be asserted through the US Plant Variety 
Protection Act, although no 'tribe' has to date deployed this 
mechanism (cited in Brush and Stabinksky 1996).

<p>7 Intellectual property rights began with the early modern state in 
Europe breaking the monopolies of guilds in giving individual 
authors rights to the products of their exertions. 
</p>
<p>8 For example, the Charter of the Indigenous-Tribal Peoples of the 
Tropical Forests (Article 40) specifies that: 'Programmes related to 
biodiversity must respect the collective rights of our peoples to 
cultural and intellectual property'.

Copyrighting traditional 
</p>
<p>Tolai knowledge? 
</p>
<p>Jacob L Simet 
</p>
<p>In 1978 the Papua New Guinea Parliament passed the Copyright and 
Neighbouring Rights Act. However, because of the absence of related 
depository legislation the Act was never gazetted and so it did not 
become law. The legislation remained in abeyance for the next twenty 
years until the subject of copyright re-emerged in 1997 and new 
legislation began to be discussed. The National Executive Council 
approved a revised Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Bill in 1999 for 
presentation to Parliament. At the same time, in anticipation that 
legislation would be passed in the not too distant future, the PNG 
government established a National Intellectual Property Rights 
Committee to administer the new legislation. The Committee is under 
the auspices of the Investment Promotion Authority. However, by May 
of 2000 the bill had still not been passed by Parliament. 
</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the passage of the first Act in 1978, debate was 
mainly concerned with the economic impact of the legislation and its 
effect on creativity. Economic concerns included Papua New Guinea's 
ability to afford copyright fees on imported intellectual property such as 
books, films and music. Arguments in favour of copyright pointed to the 
revenue that Papua New Guinea's intellectual property owners were 
losing because of the lack of copyright protection. In relation to 
creativity it was argued that Papua New Guinea as a cultural entity was 
young, so there was a need for a relaxed cultural environment allowing 
for borrowing and sharing of the products of creative effort. Copyright 
</p>
<p>62 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Copyrighting traditional Tolai knowledge? 
</p>
<p>was seen as a stumbling block that would stifle creativity. In the end, 
the arguments in favour of copyright and neighbouring rights were 
stronger, and so the legislation was passed. 
</p>
<p>During debates in 1978 the topic of traditional intellectual cultural 
property was also discussed. It was suggested that the new legislation 
should also cover indigenous peoples' knowledge. It was argued that 
since this new legislation was intended to protect the intellectual 
cultural property of Papua New Guineans and to provide then with 
economic advantages, the legislation should be wide enough to cover 
'indigenous knowledge'. However, this proposal was considered imprac-
tical for a number of reasons. One was that some of the characteristics of 
indigenous knowledge were incompatible with the basic requirements of 
copyright protection; in particular those relating to authorship, owner-
ship, originality fIxation requirements and duration provisions. A common 
argument was that all traditional knowledge is communally created and 
consequently communally owned and so belongs in the public domain. 
The absence of protection for other forms of public knowledge in the 
public domain in copyright laws of other countries was used as an 
argument for the ineligibility of indigenous knowledge for protection in 
drafting the Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act 1978. 
</p>
<p>The proposition that all traditional knowledge is communally owned 
has arisen in discussions about copyright in many other parts of the 
world. For example, in his presentation to the PacifIc sub-regional 
seminar on 'traditional knowledge', the Chief of UNESCO's Division of 
Creativity, Cultural Industries and Copyright, Professor Solab Abada, 
stated that 
</p>
<p>The specific issue here as compared to works of art protected by copyright, is that the 
expressions of fulklore1 have no known author. Generally speaking, they are the product 
of collective people's creativity, which is never complete but constantly evolving, as 
the social life of the local community itself evolves (UNESCO 1999: 126). 
</p>
<p>This idea originates from UNESCO's defInition of traditional 
knowledge, as expressed by another UNESCO official, N oriko Aikawa2 
</p>
<p>Folklore (or traditional and popular culture) is the totality of tradition-based 
creation of a cultural community, expressed by a group or individuals and 
recognised as reflecting the expectations of a community in so far as they reflect its 
cultural and social identity; its standards and values are transmitted orally, by 
invitation or by other means. Its forms ate among others, language, literature, music, 
dance, games, mythology rituals, customs, handicraft architecture and other arts 
(UNESCO 1999:113).

<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>This chapter uses examples drawn from the knowledge owning system 
of one Papua New Guinea group, the Tolai, to refute the assumption 
that all traditional knowledge is communally owned in Papua New 
Guinea. The chapter demonstrates the complexity of issues in Tolai 
practices of ownership of traditional knowledge. Tolai ownership systems 
clearly recognise three different levels of ownership-the individual, the 
vunatari (clan) and a strictly delimited or 'defined' public. Over time 
knowledge may pass from the individual to the group and then to the 
public while remaining the property of the person who originally 
possessed it. Ownership at these different layers is protected by 
supernatural powers and secrecy (Pidik). The level of ownership is 
determined by the manner in which knowledge is acquired. The Tolai 
acknowledge five ways of acquiring knowledge: barawon (dream), buai 
(school), tin bar (gift), pinapa (purchase) and waki (inheritance). 
</p>
<p>This exposition of the Tolai system of ownership of knowledge is in no 
way an argument that Tolai and the wider Papua New Guinea tradit-
ional knowledge3 can be protected under a standard copyright regime. 
Rather, its purpose is draw attention to some of the difficulties in devel-
oping mechanisms to apply copyright to the protection of traditional 
knowledge. The premise is that mechanisms can only be developed from 
a clear understanding of indigenous systems of knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Tolai systems for maintaining and safeguarding 
knowledge 
The Tolai are Melanesians who live on the Gazelle Peninsula at the 
northern tip of the Papua New Guinean island of New Britain. Before 
sustained contact with the outside world began in the 1870s, the Tolai 
lived in hamlets comprising several clans or sub-clans. Not all members 
of a sub-clan or clan lived in the same hamlet. Usually they were spread 
out over a number of hamlets. 
</p>
<p>The basic social unit ofTolai society the vunatari (clan). Descent in 
the vunatari is through the maternal line. The vunatari is the socio-
political unit and to some extent economic unit, although the sub-clan 
(apik taraz) is the property owning unit. The kinds of properties owned 
by the clan range from immovable property such as land, to movable 
property such as canoes to intangible properties such as healing 
knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Ownership of knowledge among the Tolai is highly regulated, and the 
ways of acquiring it are clearly defined. Knowledge is owned either by 
</p>
<p>64 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Copyrighting traditional Tolai knowledge? 
</p>
<p>an individual, a group or the wider public and may be protected by 
means of pidik (secrecy).4 A particular a class of spirits known as 
turangan are present in the creation, transfer and use of knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Turangan-supernatural forces 
Different spirits are associated with different ways in which knowledge is 
imparted. If a person acquires knowledge in their sleep through 
barawon, it is the turangan (spirit), which brings the knowledge-
whether it is a song, dance or tubuan design. The same is true of 
acquiring knowledge through buai (school). In going through the school, 
the person merely acquires the ability to be associated with spirits that 
later begin to deliver knowledge to him. After receiving knowledge, the 
individual has a responsibility to divulge it. The spirit does not only 
deliver the knowledge to a person, but continues to be a part of that 
knowledge and becomes its performance or activating power. Knowledge 
is rendered useless or ineffective without the presence of the spirit. 
</p>
<p>The presence of supernatural forces is also important in the transfer of 
knowledge from one person or group to another, such as through 
pinapa, tinbar or waki. Both parties to the ex-change of knowledge have 
a duty to ensure the transference of the spirit. 
</p>
<p>The supernatural or force component of knowledge is normally 
referred to as warwul (literally meaning 'swear words', but which can be 
translated as 'chant'). Holders of knowledge explain that the warwul is 
the wuwu na nilaun (breath of life). The agent which activates knowl-
edge and brings it to life. This same phrase is used in the Kuanua (Tolai) 
Bible to refer to the breath of life given by God to Adam and Eve. 
</p>
<p>Anyone may know which plant materials are used for healing or other 
kind of knowledge and may observe the various ritual actions and 
procedures involved in the performance of healing, knowledge, magic or 
dance. But they cannot claim ownership of the knowledge these plants 
and rituals are associated with nor can they practice this knowledge. 
Rights to knowledge are determined by possession of the warwul. At all 
times the owner of the knowledge keeps this warwul as pidik (secret) 
from everyone including family, clan members and close friends. 
</p>
<p>Although warwul is what activates knowledge to come to life, 
knowledge itself has a supernatural force. This makes it dangerous to use 
the knowledge without proper authority which may result in illness and 
even death. The spirit of knowledge referred to here is known as the 
tabaranira. 
</p>
<p>65 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>The association between knowledge and supernatural power is even 
stronger in the case of tubuan mask designs. Although tubuan are 
understood to be spirits in themselves, a distinction is maintained 
between the mask as material inanimate object and the spirit that it 
represents. When materials such as cane and cane leaves are gathered for 
the mask, these are still just inanimate objects that are known as nilip 
(gathered elements). They remain non-sacred objects while the mask is 
constructed. Only when the mata (eye) designs have been painted on 
the conical tops do they cease to be mere objects and become 'alive'. 
Once it becomes alive, the mask can perform the functions expected of a 
tubuan and with the powers accorded to it. It is able to protect itself 
from misuse and abuse by anyone. Anyone who tries to mistreat the 
tubuan or misuses or abuses any of its properties such as tabu faces 
instant death. This includes trying to make a tubuan mask itself without 
proper authority. 5 
</p>
<p>The consequences for misuse of other kinds of knowledge, such as 
healing knowledge, dances, songs or magic, are not as severe. The 
offender may get severely ill-ill enough for him to let everyone know 
that the cause of his illness relates to tampering with knowledge without 
proper authority. The offender himself must reveal his offence through 
confession. If the person does not confess then he will become more ill 
and die. If the person does confess, then an antidote of the knowledge 
itself, known as dokadoko, is used to remove the illness. 
</p>
<p>As described above, supernatural spirits activate knowledge but they 
are also its source and protector. A healer may know the different kinds 
of herbs and the rituals of a particular medicine but he has to harness the 
powers of the spirits to successfully practice the knowledge. In dance, 
talent, skill and even experience are not as important as knowledge of how 
to harness the power of the spirits through the ritual known as wapapa (to 
shed weights). This is performed to invite the spirit to puak (carry) a 
person during dance, in order for him to perform with elegance. 
</p>
<p>Pidik-secrecy of knowledge 
Pidik relates to the maintenance of secret knowledge by the men away 
from the uninitiated young boys and women of the village. In most 
ethnographies of Tolai, the concept of pidik is associated with the 
religious domain, in particular tubuan society" (Epstein 1969; Salisburry 
1970; Errington 1974; Neumann 1992). The maintenance of secrecy 
by the members of the society is important to the continuity of the 
</p>
<p>66 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Copyrighting traditional Tolai knowledge? 
</p>
<p>tubuan. In the tubuan society, pidik is to be maintained especially in 
relation to the belief that the mask is actually a spirit. Within the 
society, secrecy is also maintained between groups, in particular clans, 
who protect knowledge about each other's tubuans. Individuals who 
possess particular kinds of magic and ritual processes associated with the 
tubuan also maintain pidik about them from their own clansmen and the 
wider tubuan society. 
</p>
<p>In his discussion on 'affect' among the Tolai, Epstein discusses pidik 
in relation to control of information 
</p>
<p>'Secrecy is about the control of information' ; it is in this regard a matter of power. 
Among the Tolai, this is readily seen in a number of institutionalised contexts. In the 
case of the tubuan for example, acquiring the pidik, the secret is central to the 
process by which the initiation moves from one stage to the next. Again, secrecy 
seems to have been essential in the performance of many magical rites. In some 
forms of garden magic, for example, while one man performed the rite on behalf of 
a group, more might draw near the magician while he uttered his incantation lest 
they overhear his spell; later each individual would cast his own spell (Epstein 
1992:109) 
</p>
<p>He continues 
</p>
<p>Thus one's preparation for a balaguan or some similar event were a closely guarded 
secret, u vaninar kauku pidik (preparing a persons pidik)-the nature of one's 
ornamentation, the design of one's kangalor headgear, one's matatar, the daubing 
of the body with lime powder, and so on, all needed to be kept hidden from the 
knowledge of others (ibid: 109). 
</p>
<p>An example of the presence of pidik in the secular domain relates to 
the clan, the land-owning unit. Each vunatari has a history that is 
known by some of the senior members of the group. This history 
includes information about the clan's ancestors, their names, where they 
lived, the battles they fought, where some of them were buried, the 
lands they cleared and planted and what human remains they left along 
the way. Such knowledge is very important to the identity of the group 
and the determination of land ownership. Tolai land holdings stretch 
over a number of different areas, consistent with the movement of the 
group in ancestral times. The clan's history tells of the places its 
members settled as theirs, the events that took place and the evidence 
they left behind-such as fruit trees and human remains-which 
supports their claim to that land. 
</p>
<p>The history of the clan is a matter of great pidik. It is carefully 
guarded by the senior members of the vunatari. Only parts of the 
</p>
<p>67 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>history are made public when absolutely necessary. Otherwise it is a 
body of knowledge which is kept as pidik most of the time. In his 
writings about the Matupit, Epstein discusses they way in which clan 
histories are used in land disputes? In these disputes, a clan that cannot 
present its history has very little chance of successfully establishing its 
claim to land. At the same time, a clan whose history has become 
common knowledge to everyone also has less chance of making a 
successful claim to land. This is all the more important reason to 
maintain pidik in relation to clan history. 
</p>
<p>In addition to the tubuan and the vunatari, pidik is also found in 
everyday life and in the ritual domain. In everyday life, matters such as a 
person's wealth and his skills are matters of pidik. It is said that public 
knowledge of this wealth can endanger a person's life. Pidik is kept in 
relation to skills such as canoe making, gardening, fishing or hunting to 
ensure that this skill is kept within the vunatari or passed on to a 
selected person. In the realm of ritual, the observance of pidik is found 
in the preparation and performance of music, dances and making of 
head-dresses, ritual costumes and healing magic and practice. 
</p>
<p>When songs are composed, they usually have a story-line and 
background to composition. While the music may be heard by the 
public, the story-line and background information to composition are 
kept as pidik. These two pieces of information are important to the 
understanding and appreciation of the song. It is often quite difficult to 
ascertain the story-line from the lyrics, which are often written in an 
archaic language. Dances similarly depict story-lines and events that are 
not readily deciphered from a performance. Dances are covered by pidik 
and rehearsals, known as kunubak, are done in secret in the bush. 
Rehearsals may take days in the case of male dance. Preparation for 
women's dances involves kunubak but takes place on the periphery of a 
village rather than the bush. 
</p>
<p>In the pursuit of magic and healing rituals, people may see a person 
performing the actions of ritual but an important part of this process is 
the chants, which are known as warwul. Warwul is also the subject of 
great pidik. 
</p>
<p>There are specific situations in which pidik may be lifted for 
designated persons under strict conditions. Where clan information is 
kept under pidik particular members may be granted access as in the 
cases of tubuan and clan histories. The release of the pidik knowledge of 
an individual is at the individual's discretion. 
</p>
<p>68 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Copyrighting traditional Tolai knowledge? 
</p>
<p>Acquiring knowledge 
The Tolai acquire knowledge in one of five ways: barawon (dream), buai 
(school), tin bar (gift), pinapa (purchase) and waki (inheritance). Other 
than by theft, knowledge may be acquired for use for a limited period. 
Temporary use is known as totokum (hire) and involves payment of tabu 
for specific uses and set periods. 
</p>
<p>Barawon-dream 
A person can come by a new song, tubuan design, dance, magic or 
healing magic, through a dream. A dream indicates that a person has 
been visited by a spirit. People do not know why the spirit, or turangan, 
comes and the occurrence is always surprise. The spirits and knowledge 
first come to a person suddenly. The people most likely to be 
approached by spirits are persons who spend a lot of time by themselves, 
such as those who are lonely and, in many cases intellectually and/or 
physically disabled. 
</p>
<p>Buai-school 
Among the Tolai certain artistic skills, such as composing dances or 
music and design or painting, are transferred through buai. While the 
literal translation of buai is actually betel-nut, its closest meaning in 
English is 'school'. There are buai na pepe (schools) of music, dance and 
artistic design, which come under the name of the leading 'masters' of 
these arts. Neumann (1992) discusses the practice of buai. 
</p>
<p>Buai is the most common carrier of all kinds of magic; love magic, black magic 
(taring), magic to enhance one's knowledge and others. Buai can become a 
synonym for the magic itself Through the buai na pepe, men can communicate 
with spirits who advise them on the choreography of a dance, the text of a tapialai, 
or the recipe for taring (N eumann 1992:90). 
</p>
<p>Traditionally buai was a very involved matter, both for the tena buai 
(sponsor)8 and the 'candidates'. The sponsor, often a man with an 
established reputation of having a particular kinds of knowledge, would 
announce and then organise an occasion when candidates could come to 
receive buai from him. On the occasion he proposed, a loga (platform) 
would be placed at a designated location somewhere in the bush. On 
this log a different buai would be displayed for sale to interested 
candidates. The candidates come with an amount of tabu to inspect the 
</p>
<p>69 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>loga. After inspection of the loga, they pay pieces of tabu for the items of 
their choice. These items are sold to dok (pay) for the buai. 
</p>
<p>The item sold is a small parcel about the size of a strawberry which 
contains a mixture of herbs and perhaps a little bit of betel-nut. This is 
eaten by the candidate. During the eating of the parcel the candidate is 
also given the warwul (chant) of the buai. He now possesses both the 
physical and chant components of the buai. After the 'eating' of the 
buai, the candidate has to go through the process of nilip (accessing) the 
herbal ingredients of the buai, which requires the mastering of certain 
skills and knowledge of additional chants. This involves the candidates 
staying in seclusion for a few days to a week.9 What has been described 
here is the traditional process of buai, which was practiced in almost the 
same format even up until the 1970s. It is still practiced today, but not 
strictly in the same format. 
</p>
<p>Today tena buai still hold such occasions, but they are not open to the 
public. Buai are done on request or invitation, and are often smaller affairs 
involving only a handful of candidates. However, the rules are still basically 
the same; the tena buai prepares the 'parcels', the candidates come and pay 
with tabu and then 'eat' the buai and also receive the warwul and then go 
through the nilip. These rules are still very strictly followed. 
</p>
<p>Having gone through a buai does not mean that the person now 
depends entirely on his newly acquired skills to perform. Instead, the 
school only conditions him to be more accessible to the supernatural 
world, which is the main source of all new knowledge. The agents of the 
supernatural world in this scheme are the turangan. 
</p>
<p>Knowledge acquired in the first instance in this way belongs to the 
individual. 
</p>
<p>Tinbar-gift 
</p>
<p>Some kinds of traditional knowledge, such as rituals and healing 
knowledge are acquired through tin bar. A person in possession of ritual 
or healing knowledge may decide to give this knowledge to a friend, 
relative, associate or assistant. 
</p>
<p>A gift recognises a special relationship between the two persons and/ 
or recognises the support of one party for the other. Tinbar goes to a 
person who has demonstrated interest in that knowledge over the years 
and has the skills to use it. In some cases the hopeful receiver's expect-
ations are fulfilled, but in others he may be disappointed. In some ways 
the knowledge being given as tin bar is not actually a gift, because the 
</p>
<p>70 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Copyrighting traditional Tolai knowledge? 
</p>
<p>receiver does have to pay in other ways, such as in kind. It is the lack of 
transfer of tabu which classifies the transfer as a gift. 
</p>
<p>The transfer of knowledge by tin bar is a formal affair. The actual 
transfer of the knowledge is done privately between two persons. Later it 
is formalised by a small feast, attended by a few people, mainly for the 
purpose of witnessing the transfer and also to endorse it. 
</p>
<p>The knowledge acquired as such initially becomes the property of the 
individual. 
</p>
<p>Pinapa-purchase 
</p>
<p>Among the pre-contact Tolai trade was facilitated by tabu, a medium of 
exchange with similar characteristics to those of a currency. Tabu (shell 
money) was largely a ritual object but it was and is still used in many 
day-to-day transactions. As long as someone is willing to sell, a person 
wanting to acquire knowledge of any kind can purchase it with tabu. 
</p>
<p>As with tinbar, the transfer of knowledge pre-supposes an existing 
relationship. The only difference is that the relationship need not be as 
long standing as it must be for tin bar. The vendor requires a reasonable 
period of familiarity with the purchaser in order to meet certain consid-
erations. One of these important considerations is the vendor's satis-
faction that the purchaser will not misuse the knowledge, considering 
that some knowledge may have both malevolent and benevolent powers. 
The vendor also has to be satisfied that the purchaser will protect the 
knowledge from abuse and misuse by others. When the vendor is 
satisfied that these matters are in order, a transfer is made between the 
two persons in private. This is followed by a small feast in which the 
transfer is made public. 
</p>
<p>Knowledge acquired by pinapa initially becomes individual property. 
</p>
<p>Waki--inheritance 
</p>
<p>Some kinds of Tolai knowledge are clearly the property of clans but can 
only pass from person to person through inheritance. This is the case for 
ritual property such as songs, tubuan designs and dances. Knowledge 
acquired in this way can pass to an individual but it remains the 
property of the clan. The underlying rule is that all property belonging 
to the vunatari can only be passed onto the clan. If an individual 
member of the clan owns property which he has not disposed of to 
another person during his lifetime; at his death the property

<p>immediately belongs to the clan. On some occasions the clan may agree 
to transfer some of its property to others but this has to be agreed on by 
all members. Transfers of this kind are very limited-they can be made 
to either members of allied clans or children of the owing clan. 
</p>
<p>Individual ownership 
Individual persons own both tangible and intangible property. Tangible 
property that can be owned by individuals includes canoes, gardens, 
fruit trees and houses. Intangible property includes songs and dances, 
designs for dance costumes, tubuan designs and healing practices. 
</p>
<p>Some songs and dances are the property of individuals. If another 
person wants to use the songs and dances during the lifetime of the 
owner, a performance fee must be paid to the owner. A person may also 
dispose of the ownership of a song or dance to another person for 
payment in tabu. 
</p>
<p>The knowledge of healing practices can also be owned by a person. 
This knowledge is obtained either through barawon, buai, tinbar or 
pinapa. The story of Joseph ToBavul illustrates this. ToBavul is a healer 
from Vunapaka village in the north-coast hinterland of the Gazelle 
Peninsula. lo 
</p>
<p>Originally, I started working as a healer as an assistant to my father who was then a 
healer. When my father was a healer he used to send me to collect the ingredient 
plants from his medicinal mixtures, but at that time I did not know the chants that 
went with the mixtures. 
</p>
<p>Although I knew the various types of plants and how to mix them, I could not 
practice the art of healing because I did not know the accompanying chants. 
</p>
<p>Knowing the different herbs and how to mix them, I felt that I could almost 
practice healing but I knew that without the chants this knowledge was useless. 
When my father was very old I asked him for the chants. I was very pleased when 
he, without hesitation, gave it all to me. 
</p>
<p>In the beginning I tried out some of the healing-firstly on my wife. I did not want 
to try it out on other people, just my wife. There were a number of times when my 
wife had come close to death, but with the aid of my newly acquired knowledge I 
managed to bring her back to good health. 
</p>
<p>Twice my wife had two dead foetuses inside her. I tried the prescribed cure obtained 
from my father and I managed to get them out. I continued trying out my 
</p>
<p>72 </p>
<p/>

<p>Copyrighting traditional Tolai knowledge? 
</p>
<p>knowledge on my wife for a while. Gradually I tried it on other people. It was 
successful and very gradually I developed confidence in my ability. 
</p>
<p>After some time people began to hear about me as a healer and began to come to see 
me with their illness. In the beginning it was mainly people from my village and 
</p>
<p>nearby villages who came to see me. Later people from distant villages also heard about 
me and came to see me. Now I have people from all over the Gazelle Peninsula coming 
</p>
<p>to see me. Later, after I had been practicing for some time, I began to want to acquire 
other healing medicines from other people (ToBavul, personal communication). 
</p>
<p>ToBavul then acquired a number of different kinds of medicine to add 
to his knowledge. 
</p>
<p>A kutu (the vomiting of blood) . I acquired this medicine from a man called 
ToRarong from Tavuiliu village. I paid only five fathoms of tabu for this, as this man 
was a distant uncle of mine. 
</p>
<p>Waliklikum (antidotal magic). I acquired this from a matrilineal uncle of mine, 
ToNgale. He had acquired this medicine from Tolagat of Nod up Village. ToNgale 
had bought this for fifreen fathoms of tabu. I prepared some food and ten fathoms 
of tabu, brought it to ToNgale's house and acquired this medicine. 
</p>
<p>In acquiring this particular medicine I seemed to have been lucky. The time that I came 
</p>
<p>to ToNgale's house he was dying. Thus, as he had no one to give his other healing 
knowledge to he decided to give them to me. So I was able to acquire other healing 
</p>
<p>knowledge including the kilang( clairvoyance) (ToBavul, personal communication). 
</p>
<p>Joseph ToBavul acquired knowledge for about 20 healing practices from 
his father, for whom he had acted as assistant. He had also purchased or 
acquired in other ways about 15 other different medicines. In 1982, at the 
end of my interviews with him, Joseph ToBavul was considering what would 
happen to this knowledge. He told me 
</p>
<p>At the present time both the people of my own matriline and my own children are 
squabbling over who should acquire this healing knowledge from me. 
</p>
<p>At present I think my own son ToMitil will get these things because he has acted as 
assistant to me for some time now. My son now already knows the plants that I use 
</p>
<p>and how to mix them, but he still does not know the chants. 
</p>
<p>There is also a grandson of mine (a son ofToMitil) who has also worked with me 
</p>
<p>and knows the plants. But like his father, he also does not know the chants. This 
</p>
<p>grandson might also share some of the knowledge with his father. 
</p>
<p>By and by I will give them the chants (ToBavul, personal communication).

</p>
<p>Group knowledge 
The Tolai clan, or vunatari, is the basic social unit. It is comprised of 
members of a matriline who recognise a common female ancestor. The 
clan owns tangible property including land and fishing grounds, fish 
nets and traps and canoes. A clan also owns intangible property 
including tubuan designs and magic, songs, dance head-dress and 
necklace designs and the oral history of the clan. 
</p>
<p>All tubuan are owned by clans. Some clans may have more than one 
tubuan, but most clans have one. One man, usually an elder member of 
the tubuan society, manages each tubuan. A tubuan represents a spirit, 
sometimes the spirit of ancestors. The tubuan are passed down from 
generation to generation. Each tubuan is of a particular design, has a 
particular kind of magic, observes particular taboos and is said to 
consume only particular kinds of foods. This knowledge is passed down 
from one generation to the next, usually through male members of the 
matriline who are members of the tubuan society. It is very jealously 
guarded from the members of other clans. 
</p>
<p>In some cases the design and knowledge of a particular tubuan does 
not get passed down through the matriline. It may be transferred by a 
father to his son because the father did not have any descendants of his 
matriline who were old enough to receive it. In this case, at a later stage 
a descendant member of the matriline will 'buy back' the design and 
magic knowledge from the father's son. The price in tabu for this 
purchase is small, representing only a fee to the person who has looked 
after it. In other cases a clan may lose the design and magic of its tubuan 
forever. The clan then has to buy a new tubuan. In this case the purchase 
amount is quite substantial. 
</p>
<p>Dance head-dress designs are very important to Tolai cultural life. 
These designs embody and represent the spirits of ancestors and have 
been passed down from generation to generation. All members of the 
clan guard these very closely. On some occasions the designs may be 
borrowed by the members of other clans for use in particular rituals. 
Permission has to be obtained from the owning clan and a fixed 
payment of tabu is made. 
</p>
<p>As described above, each clan has an oral history that contains the 
names of its ancestors, how they migrated, where they settled, with 
whom they interacted and how they came to own property. All 
members of the clan must have this information. The importance of this 
kind of knowledge becomes apparent during disputes over property, 
</p>
<p>74 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Copyrighting traditional Tolai knowledge? 
</p>
<p>particularly land and ritual designs. This knowledge is closely guarded 
as it can sometimes be 'stolen' by other groups who may graft it onto 
their own history to support an opposing argument. 
</p>
<p>Songs, which can be for either dancing or singing, are the property of 
an individual. When the individual dies, the songs become the property 
of the clan. In the custody of the clan, the songs can be used by its 
members and are hired out for a fee to members of other clans. 
</p>
<p>Public knowledge 
Public knowledge is knowledge that everyone in society knows or has a 
right to access, including marriage procedures and gardening or fishing 
techniques. Knowledge of some songs, rhymes and most children's 
songs, rhymes and games is also public knowledge. Songs, dances and 
other knowledge which have originated from other groups are also 
included. For instance, for some time now the Tolai have been 
performing a number of songs and dances which belong to Solomon 
Island groups and also some from New Ireland. They are known as 
limilibur (entertainment) songs and dances. Generally public knowledge 
either has no significant ritual value or has origins elsewhere. However, 
as is discussed below, some public knowledge has significant ritual value. 
</p>
<p>The public sphere is usually defined by the social boundaries of the 
village, but for some kinds of knowledge this sphere extends beyond the 
village. For the purpose of describing these rules, the members of a 
village with public knowledge can be called Group A. Beyond the village 
are two categories. First, those from nearby villages or communities who 
cannot help but pick up some of the knowledge from their neighbours, 
Group B. The second category are those who live in distant villages, but 
are related to Group A. These people constitute Group C. 
</p>
<p>While knowledge might be said to be public and accessible to or for 
use by anyone, this is only completely true of the members of Group A. 
A member of that group may utilise public knowledge of the group 
within the group's territory and no one will complain. Members of 
Group B also have access to the knowledge, but acknowledge that it 
belongs to Group A. On occasion the members of Group A will remind 
Group B of this fact. The knowledge of Group A is also accessible to 
members of Group C. Persons in this group utilise the knowledge, 
perhaps out of habit like members of Group A. These persons and the 
people among whom they may be living know that this knowledge 
belongs to Group A.

<p>75 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Tolai society recognises a 'defined public' beyond which there are 
'others'. Others may choose not to use this knowledge for fear of 
offending the 'defined public' or simply have no desire for it. In a 
situation where persons outside of the defined public use knowledge 
belonging to the group, the worst that can happen to them is that they 
will be ridiculed and made fun of The normal rules of ownership, rights 
and claims are not applied here. 
</p>
<p>Most of the knowledge in the public domain has no significant ritual 
value. Knowledge which does have ritual value in the public domain 
usually arrives there by accident. Once in the public domain, knowledge 
cannot be retrieved. The use of this knowledge is often a matter of 
contention between villages and groups, and its use is closely scrutinised 
for abuse or misuse. 
</p>
<p>The case of Kabakavir music, a category of tubuan songs, can be used 
to illustrate this. Kabakavir was a man who lived about 150-200 years 
before the first white man arrived on the Gazelle Peninsula in East New 
Britain Province. He was a little man in size and had the skin disease 
grille. 11 He lived at the village of Raluana on the other side of Blanche 
Bay from Matupit Island, very close to where the township of Rabaul is 
now located. 
</p>
<p>Because of his small size and his skin disease, Kabakavir was 
ostracised. He sat alone on beaches, up in trees or in the bush. Being 
away from everyone else, he found comfort and company in composing 
and singing songs. He started singing songs that were similar to those of 
the tubuan society. As he was not a member of the tubuan society at 
Raluana, Kabakavir did not know any proper tubuan songs. When the 
tubuan men of Raluana heard him singing his songs they recognised 
them as being related to the tubuan songs and were angry that a non-
member would compose them. Non-members are not allowed to sing 
these songs. They were offended, thinking that Kabakavir was making a 
mockery of their society. They chased him into the bush and banned 
him from entering the village again. 
</p>
<p>Some time later Kabakavir managed to get a canoe and travel to 
Matupit Island on the other side of Blanche Bay where he had relatives. 
On Matupit the men of the local tubuan society did not question his 
membership in the tubuan society at Raluana. They allowed him into 
the taraiu (tubuan sanctuary). While at the tubuan sanctuary on Matupit 
Island, this little man sang his songs. The men of the tubuan society at 
Matupit liked his music. They encouraged him to teach them and to 
</p>
<p>76 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Copyrighting traditional Tolai knowledge? 
</p>
<p>compose more songs. He did this and by the time of his death he had 
left a legacy of between 80 to 100 major pieces of tubuan music, later 
known as Kabakavir music. 
</p>
<p>On his death, the body of Kabakavir was taken back to Raluana 
village for burial. There are conflicting stories about his burial. The 
Matupit version says that the body was in fact not sent back to Raluana. 
Instead, a banana trunk wrapped in pandanus leaves was sent while the 
body was actually buried at Matupit Island. The Raluana version says 
that the body was buried at Raluana. Another version is given by a 
member of the clan of Kabakavir. According to this version, when the 
body was received from Matupit it was not buried in the place where 
everyone thought it was buried. Instead, a substitute banana trunk was 
buried there. The actual body was buried in a secret place only known 
to some members of Kabakavir's clan. 
</p>
<p>Kabakavir music is now an established category of tubuan songs 
within the genre known as tapialai, which includes liu, alalu, buai and 
Kabakavir. Liu, alalu and buai categories of tubuan music are sung in all 
parts of the Gazelle Peninsula and the Duke of York Islands where 
tubuan are found. Kabakavir, on the other hand, is restricted to Matupit 
Island, two nearby villages (Talwat and Baai) , Raluana village and 
Vunapaka village in the north-coast hinterland. Matupit Island 
members of the tubuan society lay claim to the largest number of 
Kabakavir songs. On the basis of this and the assumption that most of 
these songs were composed on the island, Matupit islanders claim 
ownership of the variety of music. The fact that Kabakavir lived on the 
island until his death adds weight to their claim. 
</p>
<p>At Talwat and Baai villages, a small number of Kabakavir pieces of 
music are played. The tubuan men of these two villages do this with full 
knowledge and acknowledgment of this variety of music as having its 
origins in Matupit Island. The tubuan men of Vunapaka village in the 
north-coast hinterland also know a few pieces of the Kabakavir music. 
Someone there had even begun to compose music along Kabakavir lines. 
A member of Kabakavir's clan of Matupit Island brought it to this part 
of the Gazelle Peninsula. Kabakavir music lives on and is developing in 
this area, with the clear understanding that it belongs to Matupit 
Island. The person who is now composing Kabakavir songs at Vunapaka 
is a descendant of the person who originally introduced the music there. 
</p>
<p>At Raluana village the men of the tubuan also know only a portion of 
the Kabakavir music that is found on Matupit Island. They do not agree 
</p>
<p>77 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>that this music belongs to Matupit Island. They say the music belongs 
to Raluana, because Kabakavir came from there originally and that on 
his death he was buried there and so his spirit is there. Further, the 
descendants of Kabakavir's clan claim that they have possession of his 
bones, which they use for buai na pinpit (music composition magic). 
</p>
<p>Conclusion 
Increasing globalisation threatens the ability of communities in Papua 
New Guinea to control access to and use of their traditional knowledge. 
There are a number of ways in which traditional knowledge could be 
protected, including by patent, sui-generis systems, or a modified version 
of copyright. In developing any mechanism, there must be a clear 
understanding about how indigenous systems work, rather than broad-
based assumptions. 
</p>
<p>One idea which might easily form part of the development of a 
mechanism for protection of traditional knowledge is the assumption 
that all traditional knowledge is communally owned. This discussion of 
the Tolai system of knowledge shows that people were very particular 
about acquisition, ownership, transfer, protection and use of knowledge. 
Only some kinds of Tolai knowledge belonged to the public domain, 
while the rest belonged to individuals and social groups. If an 
appropriate system of protection is to be developed for Papua New 
Guinea which is sensitive to systems like those of the Tolai, it is 
important that these nuances be properly understood.

<p>Notes 
1 'Folklore' is the term used by UNESCO to mean 'traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge'. This particular terminology has had difficulties being 
accepted by many member states of UNESCO. France does not accept 
this because the French translation is derogatory. A number of Mrican 
counties also want this term to be phased out of usage. At the 1999 
UNESCO sponsored Symposium on 'The Protection of Traditional 
Knowledge' in Noumea, there was strong opposition to using the term 
by most Pacific Island countries except for Australia. 
</p>
<p>2 Ms Noriko Aikawa is the Chief on the Intangible Heritage List, 
UNESCO. The definition she gives here is actually the one used in 
the 1989 'UNESCO Recommendation on the Protection of Folklore 
and Cultural Expressions' and appears in Chapter 1 of the document. 
</p>
<p>3 The term 'rights' has to be used here with reservation, as there seems 
to be difficulty in the translation of this term into Tolai. This has 
implications for possible inappropriateness of the concept itself. 
</p>
<p>4 The concept of ownership also has to be used with caution, as its 
usage also has implications on the concept of 'rights'. 
</p>
<p>5 Only the applications of dokadoko (protective magic) can stop this. 
Each knowledge has its own protective magic, so the right one has to 
be used. Any other protective magic would not have any effect. 
</p>
<p>6 The tubuan society is a fraternity, also commonly known as a secret 
society. It is represented by a mask known as tubuan. Membership is 
restricted to adult males and older boys, but involved the payment 
of an amount of tabu (shell money). 
</p>
<p>7 Epstein's work among the Tolai in the late 1960s was mainly 
centered on 'land tenure'. A great deal of his time was spent on land 
disputes, which took place between different clans. 
</p>
<p>8 The 'sponsor' is the person who prepares the occasion. He meets all 
the costs of putting the loga together. It is like a commercial 
investment, which took place between different clans. 
</p>
<p>9 Today the seclusion in the bush is not always observed, although it 
is still vety strictly observed on occasions of acquiring knowledge 
relating to tubuan. In this case the seclusion period is known as 
nidok, involving a period of two weeks and still practiced on the 
Gazelle Peninsula.

The National Cultural 
</p>
<p>Property (Preservation) Act 
</p>
<p>Mark Busse 
</p>
<p>We must build a nation in which tribal languages and cultural boundaries are 
transcended, not for exploitation of one group by another but for mutual support 
of each other(Narokobi 1980:78). 
</p>
<p>The people of the Lake Murray-Middle Fly area of Western Province, 
among whom I carried out anthropological research in the 1980s, said 
that objects could never be separated in any way that mattered from the 
people who made them, and that one could always see the person who 
made an object in the object that he or she made. This was a striking 
claim about the relationship between objects and people and an astute 
statement about the complexity of objects and the capacity that certain 
things have for evoking complicated thoughts and feelings in those who 
see them or interact with them. Objects are more than physical things. 
They are manifestations of creativity, knowledge, physical skill (which is 
a type of embodied knowledge) and social relations. Garamuts from the 
Sepik River are not simply carved and hollowed out logs which can be 
used to produce sound-they are the products of the skill and genius of 
the persons who carved them. They contain and express the beliefs and 
aesthetics of the people who make and use them, and they are 
embedded in a system of social relations, both in their ownership and 
their production, for the person-in-the-object is a social person. 
</p>
<p>An object can have different meanings for different people, and the 
same object can have different meanings in different contexts-different 
</p>
<p>81 </p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>places, different times and different events. The significance of a 
garamut is different for men and women or for older men and younger 
men in its home community. Similarly, its meaning is different 
depending on whether it is in the village haus tambaran, the National 
Museum in Port Moresby or an auction house in Sydney, London or 
New York. 
</p>
<p>This chapter explores the multiple and often intricate meanings of a 
particular category of objects-national cultural property-with 
reference to the National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act which, 
according to its preamble, is 'an Act relating to the preservation and 
protection of objects of cultural or historical importance to Papua New 
Guinea'. 
</p>
<p>The relevance of national cultural property to the broader issues of 
intellectual property in Papua New Guinea is two-fold. First, inasmuch 
as cultural objects are manifestations of knowledge, creativity and social 
relations and cannot be separated from these, they are a type of 
intellectual property. Second, the National Cultural Property 
(Preservation) Act provides an example of legislation which already exists 
in Papua New Guinea that is designed to protect a particular form of 
intellectual property, Therefore, it is worth considering the historical 
development and provisions of this law, as well as how the law is 
implemented and enforced. 
</p>
<p>A consideration of the National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act 
suggests some important questions that need to be asked in the 
development of intellectual property legislation. Some of these 
questions relate to definitions of property and ownership-how we 
think about the basic multiple relationships between people and 
things. Others concern the possibility that certain types of property 
should be protected-and, if so, how and from whom-and whether 
there are objects that should not be considered property at all. 
Additionally the National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act raises 
important questions about how a national government, through 
intellectual property legislation for example, might act on behalf of the 
plurality of people who make up the country. These are fundamental 
questions that arise repeatedly in working with the National Cultural 
Property (Preservation) Act, and they are the types of questions which 
must be asked in the process of developing intellectual property 
legislation. 
</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act 
</p>
<p>History 
</p>
<p>The historical context of the development of cultural property 
legislation in Papua New Guinea is that of European colonialism. Since 
the fifteenth century-when both European colonial empires and the 
systematic collection of antiquities and artifacts by Europeans had 
their beginnings-war, colonial administration, the desire for 
scientific knowledge, economic power and theft all contributed to a 
flow of cultural objects out of colonies and into the powerful 
countries of Europe and America. The collections in the great 
eighteenth and nineteenth century museums in cities such as 
London, Paris, Madrid and Berlin were closely linked to the military, 
commercial and colonial activities of their governments abroad (Ley 
1991: 14-16). 
</p>
<p>The flow of cultural objects from Mrica, Central and South America 
and the Pacific into countries in Europe and North America continues 
today, although on a lesser scale. The reduction in the movement of 
cultural objects has been due in part to the efforts of organisations 
such as UNESCO-which has encouraged greater respect for non-
Western cultures and greater international cooperation concerning 
cultural property-and in part to the efforts of previous colonies to 
enact and enforce legislation to protect their cultural property (ibid: 14-
16). 
</p>
<p>The first legislation regulating and restricting the trade and export of 
cultural property in what is now Papua New Guinea was instituted in 
the Territory of Papua in 1913. Since then, the laws that deal with 
cultural objects have developed in response to changing local attitudes 
about cultural heritage as well as international developments concerning 
the protection of cultural property. Throughout these changes, what has 
remained fundamental has been the assertion by the government-first 
the colonial government and then the government of the independent 
state-of the importance of restricting the acquisition, ownership and 
movement of certain objects and categories of objects thought to be 
important to a wider segment of people than those individuals or groups 
who owned or controlled them. 
</p>
<p>The historical discussion that follows focuses on the definitions of 
cultural property and the kinds of restrictions imposed by the 
government on movement and ownership of that property.

</p>
<p>The Papuan Antiquities Ordinance (1913) 
</p>
<p>Ordinance Number 14 of 1913 (Section 2), titled 'An Ordinance 
Relating to Papuan Antiquities', defined Papuan antiquities to include 
'Papuan relics' and 'such articles manufactured with Papuan tools and 
according to Papuan methods and such other articles and things of 
historical or scientific value or interest and relating to Papua as may be 
prescribed by regulation'. 1 
</p>
<p>The 1913 Ordinance made it illegal to remove Papuan antiquities 
from Papua without first offering the objects for sale at a reasonable price 
to the colonial government. Enforcement of the Ordinance was 'the 
duty of all European [meaning white] constables and officers of the 
Customs' who were given the power to 'seize and detain' any antiquities 
that were being removed from the Territory. The penalty for exporting 
Papuan antiquities from the Territory without the written permission of 
the Commissioner for Native Mfairs and Control was a fine not 
exceeding &pound;1 00 or, in default, imprisonment for a period not exceeding 
six months with or without hard labour-substantial penalties for that 
time. The Ordinance also provided that any Papuan antiquities entered 
or shipped for export without the permission of the Commissioner for 
Native Affairs and Control were to be forfeited and vested in the King 
'for the use of the people of the Territory'. 
</p>
<p>The Ordinance was, not surprisingly, very paternalistic. The emphasis 
was on how an object was made rather than on the meaning of an object 
for the people who made and used it. What constituted Papuan tools 
and Papuan methods was assumed to be non-problematic.2 There was 
no suggestion that colonial officers should consult with Papuans or in 
any way seek their views about what kinds of objects should or should 
not have been protected under the Ordinance. It was the duty of white 
police constables and white customs officers to enforce the Ordinance, 
and they had the power to seize Papuan antiquities which would then 
be forfeited to the King. It was not the responsibility of indigenous 
police constables, and no mention was made of the possibility of 
returning seized objects to the communities from which they had been 
removed. From the determination as to which objects were worthy of 
protection to the final disposition of objects that people tried to remove 
illegally from the Territory, Papuan antiquities were assumed to be the 
exclusive concern of the colonial government. 
</p>
<p>The temporal distance contained in the phrase 'Papuan antiquities' 
underlined the separation between Europeans and Papuans. The word 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act 
</p>
<p>'antiquity' generally refers to ancient times or to objects of great age. 
The only references in the Papuan Antiquities Ordinance to the past or 
to the age of objects, however, were implicit in the definition of Papuan 
antiquities as including relics and things of historical value.3 Despite the 
fact that the Ordinance was explicitly about antiquities (and thus, it 
would seem, about objects of great age), it is clear from the definition 
that objects still being 'manufactured with Papuan tools and according 
to Papuan methods' in 1913 were also considered antiquities, implying 
that the people who made such objects were living in the distant past. 
</p>
<p>The dismissal of Papuans and the objects that they made to the 
distant past was compatible with early twentieth century European 
ideas about social evolution which expressed the differences between 
Europeans and non-Europeans in evolutionary and thus temporal terms. 
This temporal distancing was not only manifested in colonial ordinances 
such as the Papuan Antiquities Ordinance, but was also reflected in 
statements characterising Papuans as living in the stone age or in 
formulations such as 'the land that time forgot' and '10,000 years in a 
lifetime'. These characterisations continue to influence Western images 
of Papua New Guinea today and have been an enduring part of the 
marketing of Melanesia as a tourist destination for the last 70 years 
(Douglas 1996:174-80). 
</p>
<p>Regulations under the Papuan Antiquities Ordinance 
</p>
<p>During the 40 years following 1913, regulations made under the 
Papuan Antiquities Ordinance suggest the kinds of conflicts to which 
the Ordinance gave rise. These regulations further defined the objects 
protected under the Ordinance, the administrative procedures through 
which permission to remove antiquities from Papua could be obtained 
and the factors taken into account in deciding to grant such permission. 
It is clear that these regulations responded to conflicts between 
Europeans who had differing views about the appropriateness of buying, 
selling and exporting Papuan material culture. No evidence suggests that 
any regulations reflected Papuan concerns or that there was any 
consultation with Papuans about what should be or should not be 
protected. 
</p>
<p>In 1914, a regulation was made which listed the objects considered to 
be Papuan antiquities within the meaning of the Ordinance. The items 
were listed in a schedule and defined by reference to the materials from 
which they were made.4 At the end of the list the general definition of 
</p>
<p>85 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Papuan antiquities in the Ordinance was reiterated in a final catch-all 
phrase 'all articles manufactured with Papuan tools according to Papuan 
methods' regardless of material. The same regulation also listed types of 
items specifically exempted from the provisions of the Ordinance. These 
types of items did not require government permission in order to be 
exported.s There is no explanation concerning why it was necessary to 
gazette a list of examples of Papuan antiquities in addition to restating 
the Ordinance's broad definition of Papuan antiquities, or why 
particular types of objects were put on one list rather than the other. 
Why, for example, were headdresses exceeding two feet in length 
specifically protected? Why were carvings and paintings on wood 
restricted, but shields were not? It is likely that the 1914 Regulation 
reflected a compromise between the business interest of artifact dealers 
and collectors on the one hand and the colonial administration's 
concern, for reasons which are unclear, about the wholesale export of 
indigenous material culture on the other. 
</p>
<p>A notice published in the Papuan Government Gazette in October 
1916 and regulations gazetted in 1918 suggest that there were 
continuing conflicts over the buying, selling and exporting of material 
culture from Papua. The notice stated that 'permission will not be 
given to export or ship for export any Papuan Antiquities except to the 
accredited representative of an officially recognized scientific 
institution'. This was the first example of a growing justification of the 
exporting of artifacts from Papua and New Guinea on scientific 
grounds. 6 
</p>
<p>The absurdities of calling contemporary objects antiquities were made 
clear in 1939 when the Papuan Antiquities Ordinance was amended to 
include archaeological objects. This amendment gave the Lieutenant-
Governor the authority (in Council) to 'make regulations for the 
preservation and acquisition of objects of antiquity' where objects of 
antiquity were defined as 'any archaeological treasures of the Territory 
not being Papuan antiquities'. 'Objects of antiquity' were thus 
distinguished from 'Papuan antiquities' on the grounds that the former 
were objects from the past discovered through archaeological methods 
whereas the latter were objects made by people possibly living in the 
present but using methods and tools belonging to a culture (Papuan) 
belonging to the past.

<p>The National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act 
</p>
<p>Further historical developments 
</p>
<p>Legislation similar to the Papuan Antiquities Ordinance was enacted in 
the Territory of New Guinea in 1922. This ordinance, the New Guinea 
Antiquities Ordinance, was virtually identical to the Papuan Ordinance 
with many sections in the two ordinances using exactly the same words 
and expressions. Two amendments were subsequently made to the New 
Guinea Antiquities Ordinance that are significant for the purposes of 
this discussion. 
</p>
<p>First, an amendment made in 1923 gave the Administrator of the 
Territory of New Guinea the power not only to restrict the export of 
certain categories of objects but to prohibit the ownership of certain 
types of objects by certain people. The same year, this amendment was 
used to forbid the acquisition or transfer of ownership of human skeletal 
material of any type including human skulls. It was also subsequently 
used to prohibit the acquisition or transfer of ownership of two carvings 
from the Karawari River area. 
</p>
<p>Second, in 1936 authority to act under the Ordinance was delegated 
to District Officers in New Guinea. This delegation of authority was 
made in response to complaints from artifact dealers about what were 
perceived as unnecessary delays in the approval of exports of artifacts 
from the Territory. 
</p>
<p>Following the administrative amalgamation of the Territory of Papua 
and the Territory of New Guinea, the Papuan Antiquities Ordinance and 
the New Guinea Antiquities Ordinance were consolidated into the 
Antiquities Ordinance of 1953. This ordinance included no new 
provisions and simply incorporated the provisions of the two previous 
ordinances. It was repealed in 1965 by a new ordinance passed by the 
joint Territory's House of Assembly. 
</p>
<p>The National Cultural Property Ordinance (1965) 
</p>
<p>The passing of the new National Cultural Property (Preservation) 
Ordinance by the House of Assembly for the Territory of Papua and 
New Guinea in 1965 marked an important turning point in the 
legislation on cultural property in what is now Papua New Guinea. This 
ordinance, which at Independence became the National Cultural 
Property (Preservation) Act, replaced the language of antiquities with 
</p>
<p>87 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>the language of national cultural property. It also gave the responsibility 
for the enforcement of the ordinance to the Trustees of the Papua and 
New Guinea Public Museum and Art Gallery, which had been 
established in 1954 and was the immediate forerunner of the current 
National Museum and Art Gallery. 
</p>
<p>The change from the language of antiquities to the language of 
national cultural property was important for at least three reasons. First, 
it removed the social evolutionary absurdity that objects produced in 
the present were described as objects from the distant past. Second, by 
defining national cultural property in terms of cultural heritage, it 
suggested a move from the protection of objects defined in terms of 
Western scientific interests or in terms of objects made in a particular 
way ('an article manufactured by Natives with Native-made tools 
and according to Native methods') to the protection of objects 
because they were important to Papua New Guineans' own 
understandings of their cultures and their past. Finally, the new 
ordinance introduced the idea of a national interest in the protection 
of cultural objects at the beginning of the last decade of Australian 
colonial rule. 
</p>
<p>The National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act 
At Independence, the National Cultural Property (Preservation) 
Ordinance became the National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act. 
The Act explicitly states that the administration of the Act is the 
responsibility of the Trustees of the National Museum. The Act (Section 
2) defines national cultural property as 
</p>
<p>any property, movable or immovable, of particular importance to the cultural 
heritage of the country, and in particular (but without limiting the generality of the 
foregoing) includes-any object, natural or artificial, used for, or made or adapted 
for use for, any purpose connected with the traditional cultural life of any of the 
peoples of the country, past or present. 
</p>
<p>The definition of national cultural property is thus intentionally 
broad and general. This is important both because of the cultural 
diversity of Papua New Guinea-and hence the existence of multiple 
cultural heritages instead of a single cultural heritage-and because the 
objects of cultural property covered by the Act are individually unique. 
In addition to national cultural property, the Act also divides cultural 
objects into two other categories-proclaimed cultural property and 
objects not covered by the provisions of the Act. 
</p>
<p>88 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act 
</p>
<p>Proclaimed cultural property 
</p>
<p>The most restricted category of cultural property defined by the 
National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act is 'proclaimed cultural 
property'. Under Section 4 of the Act, the Head of State, acting on 
advice from the Trustees of the National Museum, may declare any 
object or category of objects to be proclaimed cultural property. 
</p>
<p>To date, about 400 individual objects have been gazetted as 
proclaimed cultural property. As required under Section 12 of the Act, 
the National Museum, on behalf of the Trustees, maintains a register of 
these objects which cannot legally be acquired or moved without the 
permission of the Trustees. People who have possession or control of 
objects that are proclaimed cultural property must legally notifY the 
Trustees if there is any change in the situation or condition of the 
objects. 
</p>
<p>Some of these objects of proclaimed cultural property are now in the 
National Museum, but the majority are located in villages where 
villagers consider them to be important cultural objects. Because the 
protection of these objects depends on cooperation between the 
National Museum and the people in the villages in which the objects are 
located, the National Museum uses the Act as much as possible to assist 
villagers to protect those objects which they want to protect. This is in 
contrast with the colonial period and the period immediately following 
Independence when government officers recommended objects for 
gazettal primarily on the basis of an object's artistic or historical value 
from a European perspective. At the same time, the National Museum 
tries to monitor community attitudes since the meanings of objects may 
change over time. Thus objects that a community once wanted to 
protect may become less important and may even become objects that 
the community wants to dispose of. 
</p>
<p>Several categories of objects (as opposed to particular objects) have 
also been gazetted as proclaimed cultural property-human remains of 
any kind, traditional funerary objects, carvings or engravings on stone, 
carvings or engravings made wholly or partly with stone tools, paintings 
or carvings on rocks or in caves, ancient pottery and relics of historical or 
antiquarian interest. In addition, any of the following categories of 
objects are proclaimed cultural property if they were made before 
31 December 1960-parts of ceremonial houses, carved garamuts and 
garamut sticks, carved wooden masks, masks of any material other than 
wood, carved wooden shields, carved wooden ancestral boards, musical 
</p>
<p>89 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>instruments and carved wooden figures. It is important to note that 
while the Act prohibits both the acquisition and exporting of objects in 
these categories if they were made before the end of 1960, this does not 
mean that objects made later are automatically acceptable exports. 
Objects made after 1960 may still be prohibited exports because of their 
importance to the cultural heritage of the country or the cultural 
heritage of a particular group of citizens. 
</p>
<p>Objects exempted from the Act 
</p>
<p>At the other end of the continuum from proclaimed cultural property 
are those categories of objects which are specifically exempted from the 
provisions of the National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act. These 
mainly include objects that have been recently made for sale to tourists 
and artifact dealers. Most objects regularly purchased by tourists as 
souvenirs are included on the list of exempted categories of objects. 
</p>
<p>National cultural property 
</p>
<p>The third category of objects defined by the Act is national cultural 
property. Most cultural objects fall into this category. The Act defines 
national cultural property as any property of particular importance to 
the cultural heritage of the country, including any objects made or 
adapted for use in connection with the traditional cultural life of any of 
the peoples of the country. The Act thus allows for the protection of 
hybrid objects which are combinations of traditional and non-
traditional materials. Objects as diverse as a garamut made in 1970, a 
lime gourd and spatula, a mask made in 1995 for the ordination of a 
priest and a piece of metal hafted as an adze for carving canoes are all 
national cultural property. 
</p>
<p>The Act gives the Trustees of the National Museum considerable 
power with respect to national cultural property. For example, they have 
the power to recommend to the Head of State that national cultural 
property-whether movable or immovable-should be compulsorily 
acquired, or that ownership of it should be prohibited or restricted. 
</p>
<p>The Trustees, or persons authorised by them, may enter and search 
any land, building, aircraft, vessel or vehicle in which there is reasonable 
cause to believe that there may be national cultural property. A person 
can be required to provide information about, or to produce for 
inspection, national cultural property in his or her control or possession. 
</p>
<p>90 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act 
</p>
<p>The Trustees and their representatives also have the power to seize and 
detain for examination any item of national cultural property. Anyone 
who hinders or obstructs the Trustees or their representatives in the 
exercise of these powers is guilty of an offence under the Act. Finally, 
people who wilfully damage, deface or destroy national cultural property 
are also guilty of an offence. 
</p>
<p>Implementation and enforcement 
</p>
<p>Under the National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act, a person 
exporting or removing from the country any item of national cultural 
property without the written consent of the Trustees of the National 
Museum is guilty of an offence. This permission is given in the form of 
an export permit or license to export. The decision about whether an 
object of national cultural property should be allowed to leave the 
country is a decision for the Trustees of the National Museum who are 
also authorised to settle any disputes arising from the enforcement of the 
Act. The primary criterion used to make this decision is whether an 
object is important to the cultural heritage (or cultural heritages) of the 
country. Lesser criteria include age, rarity and whether the type of object 
is represented in the collections held by the National Museum. 
</p>
<p>On a day-to-day basis, the enforcement of the National Cultural 
Property (Preservation) Act, including the issuing of export permits, is 
carried out by staff at the National Museum. People who want an export 
permit must apply in writing and must either produce the objects that 
they want to export for inspection or provide clear photographs of the 
objects. The Museum reserves the right (given by the Act) to inspect 
objects in person. There is no charge for export permits, and most 
permits are issued within 24 hours after the application is received. 
</p>
<p>The cooperation of people in rural areas and provincial centres is vital 
to the enforcement efforts of the National Museum, and in most 
instances there is good cooperation from individuals and organisations. 
The Museum regularly receives reports from villagers, government 
officers and tourist operators about possible violations of the Act, which 
are investigated often in cooperation with police and customs officers at 
the district, provincial and national levels. Any item of national cultural 
property exported or attempted to be exported without the written 
permission of the Trustees is a prohibited export within the meaning of 
the Customs Act and so can be seized by the customs officers under the 
provisions of that Act. 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>The main difficulties encountered by the National Museum in 
implementing the National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act lie in 
not having sufficient resources to enforce the Act and in the high prices 
that Papua New Guinean national cultural property fetches on the 
international art market. The adequate enforcement of legislation such as 
the National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act requires a significant 
commitment of time by Museum personnel. 
</p>
<p>The high value of Papua New Guinean national cultural property on 
the international art market has two effects. First, the National Museum 
is unable to compete to purchase such objects when they are offered for 
sale in other countries. Second, and more importantly, dealers and 
collectors are willing to take considerable risks to remove objects from 
the country illegally. 
</p>
<p>International agreements 
The 1972 Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural 
and Natural Heritage (often referred to as the World Heritage 
Convention) is the primary international agreement concerned with 
cultural heritage. Papua New Guinea recently acceded to this 
convention, which in the cultural arena seeks to protect only immovable 
cultural property such as monuments, groups of buildings and sites. 
The National Museum is currently taking the first steps in having two 
important archaeological sites added to the list of World Heritage sites. 
These are the Kuk archaeological site outside Mount Hagen, which 
was one of the earliest agricultural sites in the world, and 
archaeological sites on the Huon Terraces in Morobe Province, which 
contain the earliest evidence of human habitation on the island of New 
Guinea. In July 1997, the Director of the National Museum made a 
preliminary presentation concerning these two sites at a UNESCO 
meeting in Suva where possible World Heritage sites in the Pacific 
were reviewed. 
</p>
<p>The main international agreement on movable cultural property, as 
opposed to immovable cultural property, is the 1970 UNESCO 
Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit 
Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. Papua 
New Guinea is not currently a signatory to this agreement. This 
convention recognises that states have an obligation to protect cultural 
property from illegal export, theft and destruction. It also recognises 
that the exchange of cultural property is important for cross-cultural 
</p>

<p/>

<p>The National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act 
</p>
<p>understanding, and that the definition of cultural heritage is subjective 
and varies from culture to culture. Signatory states are permitted to 
declare exactly what forms of cultural property are to be protected (Ley 
1991: 19). 
</p>
<p>Signatories to the Convention on Cultural Property agree to oppose 
illicit traffic in cultural property in several ways, including creating 
inventories of cultural property, educating the general public, 
formulating appropriate laws and penalties, enforcing a system of import 
and export permits and assisting in returning illegally exported cultural 
property. 
</p>
<p>Opinions concerning the effectiveness of the Convention on Cultural 
Property vary considerably. In a 1991 report on a ministerial review of 
cultural heritage legislation in Australia, it was stated that the 
Convention 'is widely regarded as the most important agreement 
relating to the traffic in cultural property' (Ley 1991:18). A more recent 
1996 review of the Convention, however, stated that '[t]he extent to 
which the convention has succeeded in stemming the flow of cultural 
property to dealers in ethnic artworks is not clear and may be minimal' 
(Posey and Dutfield 1996:115). Those who argue that the Convention 
is relatively ineffective point to the fact that it relies on member states to 
introduce their own legislation and to police it effectively, and to the 
fact that a number of states that are important in the art importing 
business, including Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland, have not 
acceded (Ley 1991:19-20). 
</p>
<p>Conclusion 
Cultural objects are complex manifestations of creativity, knowledge and 
social relations, and cultural property is a form of intellectual property. 
For Papua New Guinea, legislation protecting cultural property has 
existed since 1913. At present, the movement and, in some instances, 
the ownership of cultural property is governed by the National Cultural 
Property (Preservation) Act which is administered by the Trustees of the 
National Museum. 
</p>
<p>While using the language of property, the National Cultural Property 
Act restricts the transaction of certain objects and categories of objects 
by asserting national interest-they are important to the collective 
history and identity of the whole people, the citizens, of the country. 
The history of the development of the Act has been toward allowing 
local people to say what objects they think are important and which

<p>they want to protect, The government, by acting to protect objects of 
national cultural property, acts on behalf of a plurality of people, In 
taking account of local concerns, it argues for the importance of certain 
objects beyond the local level, for the importance of objects for the 
nation as a whole. 
</p>
<p>Debates about intellectual property, including cultural property, 
must consider not only the protection of people's rights over property 
and over the products of their creativity and labour. They also need to 
consider whether the capitalist concept of alienable property-of objects 
and things that can be freely bought and sold-is appropriate for all 
types of objects and cultural intangibles such as songs, dances and oral 
traditions. These debates must take account of the complexity and social 
embeddedness of objects, of the difficulty of saying where an object or 
an intangible aspect of culture begins and ends. They need to take 
account of what people in the Middle Fly would describe as the person-
in-the-object.

<p>Notes 
In common English usage, a relic is a survival from the past or 
something of religious reverence. 
</p>
<p>2 For example, questions such as whether a steel axe head-hafted in 
the same way that stone axes were hafted-constituted a Papuan tool 
were not considered. 
</p>
<p>3 The historical value of an object was, of course, something for the 
colonial government rather than the local people to determine. 
</p>
<p>4 The items considered Papuan antiquities and listed in the regulation 
included: carvings, paintings or drawings on wood, bamboo, coconut 
palm, stone or bone (including skulls); implements, weapons, tools 
and ornaments made of the same materials; shell ornaments and 
carvings on shell; ceremonial canoes; drawings or representations of 
animals on pottery; garments made of feathers; feather headdresses 
exceeding two feet in length; fossilised bone; stuffed human heads; 
any dried or preserved specimen or part of a human body; and 
armour of any kind of material. 
</p>
<p>5 The categories of objects exempted were as follows: all articles 
consisting of common types of disc clubs, spears, miniature houses, 
model canoes, bows, arrows, nets, native cloth, kaipas (net bags), 
wooden clubs, belts, shields, bamboo pipes (baubaus), baskets, 
combs, spoons, wristlets, fishing sticks, walking sticks and matting. 
</p>
<p>6 The purpose of collecting, and in particular the distinction between 
the collecting of curios by artifact dealers and scientific collecting, 
was taken up in 1923 by the government anthropologist in Papua, 
F.E. Williams (1923).

</p>
<p>In Papua New Guinea today, natural resources are seen as properry to be 
exploited. Cultural resources are increasingly equated with natural resources 
and intellectual properry rights provide an avenue for them, too, to be 
exploited. Whereas natural resources are an embodiment of nature, cultural 
resources are products of human sociery. Papua New Guinea's unique cultural 
heritage includes social practices and material traces that remind present 
generations of their origins and the world of their ancestors. It also includes 
an archaeological record that goes beyond the threshold of human memory, 
extending over 50,000 years of human occupation.

<p>Ownership of ideas and things 
</p>
<p>outsiders have created new expectations among the owners and custodians of 
cultural artifacts and knowledge. These expectations must influence 
approaches to the preservation and promotion ofPapua New Guinean 
cultural heritage, but they should also inform debates about intellectual 
property. Intellectual property rights that serve to commodity culture even 
further may not be in the long-term interests of the owners of cultural 
knowledge, or those of the country as a whole. 
</p>
<p>This chapter discusses people's attitudes towards the ownership of ideas 
and things. The word ownership is chosen in preference to intellectual 
property rights. For some people, the word intelligence is associated with 
success in the formal education system. Intellectual property rights can 
therefore be seen as rights only accruing to a few selfish members of the 
educated elite. This poses a question worth considering-what are the 
intellectual property rights of the residents of Morata settlement in Port 
Moresby? 
</p>
<p>The quotations at the beginning of this chapter were recorded during 
conversations with two prominent local leaders from Kuk historical site in 
Western Highlands Province. This chapter considers issues of the ownership 
of ideas and things from the perspective of the makers of these two 
statements. At the heart of the issues are the relationships between the 
leaders ofKuk and the academics who came to study the site. In discussing 
these relationships, I wish to acknowledge that I have benefited from 
continued interaction with the leaders of this area-through constant 
dialogue-and with the academics who have studied it-through reading 
their writings. I am particularly indebted to the writings of Andrew 
Strathern (1985), Marilyn Strathern (1996) and Jack Golson (1977, 1982). 
</p>
<p>The chapter is written from a number of overlapping perspectives-as a 
member of a neighbouring communi ty, as a researcher trained in an 
analytical framework and as an intellectual seeking to explore the concept of 
intellectual property rights. It begins with an outline of the background to 
the debate about the Kuk site, and then considers in turn the issues raised 
by the statements of the two informants. 
</p>
<p>Background to the Kuk debate 
In the late 1960s, the Department of Primary Industry purchased 700 acres 
of swamp in the Kuk basin from its owners, the Kawelka tribe, to establish a 
tea plantation, which later became an agricultural research station. Early in 
its history, Jim AlIen, recently appointed as a lecturer in prehistory in the 
Department of Anthropology and Sociology at the new University ofPapua

</p>
<p>New Guinea, visited the station and saw the sort of evidence for ancient 
swamp drainage and cultivation which Jack Golson of the Australian National 
University had previously reported for the Warrawau tea plantation (AlIen 
1970; Golson et al, 1967). 
</p>
<p>The Kuk site has since acquired international significance as a result of 
the work of Golson, who, in collaboration with several other scientists, has 
dedicated much of his scholarly life to the reconstruction of the gardening 
systems. Six major systems were revealed-9,000 BP, 6,000-5,500 BP, 
4,000-2,500 BP, 2,000-1,200 BP, 400-250 BP and 250-100 BP'3 
Microscopic parts of plants growing in the swamp or carried into it by wind 
or water from outside gave information about forest, grassland, climate and 
human cultures. Wooden artifacts (wooden spades and digging sticks) 
recovered from permanently waterlogged conditions provided information 
about the kind of technology used in the management of wet and dry land 
cultivations (Golson 1977, 1982). 
</p>
<p>Kuk is now known throughout the world as one of the earliest centres of 
independent innovation of agriculture, regularly acknowledged in standard 
introductory textbooks (Fagan 1980:198, 1990:224-6; Renfrew and Bahn 
1991 :228), Part of the significance of the site lies in the tangible evidence it 
provides of a sense of identity and habitation that equal the history of 
human occupation anywhere in the world (Groube et al. 1986). These 
revelations not only provide an important piece of the jigsaw about human 
history-they also help to debunk the myths about small-scale tribal 
societies that are embedded in phrases like 'primitive' and 'stone age'. 
</p>
<p>The death of scientific interest in Kuk 
</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the Kuk site is so well known, and has provided so 
much evidence of significance, is that issues of a political nature did not 
impede nearly 20 years of scientific research. There was no conflict of 
interest between the local landowners and the efforts by academics and 
authorities to study and protect this ancient cultural resource. The site was 
located on a property belonging to the state. With a series of 
understanding station managers, it was protected from destruction by the 
fact that the eastern half of the station was not brought into immediate 
cultivation. 
</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1990, it was decided to close the Kuk station. A 
number of reasons appear to have prompted this, including declining 
government revenue as a result of the Panguna copper mine closure, and 
concerns about the safety of staff. Staff of the provincial government of the

<p>Ownership of ideas and things 
</p>
<p>Western Highlands attempted to negotiate with local landowners a way of 
mothballing the property until operations could start up again. It was 
proposed that provincial public servants should occupy the vacated houses, 
and part of the rent collected should go back to the villagers. A general 
agreement was reached among the landowners to open a passbook account 
to receive the rent. However, misuse of the account led to a dispute among 
the Kawelka, who in turn harassed the public servants. This led to the total 
abandonment of the station. The residential compound was subsequently 
occupied by the landowners themselves. 
</p>
<p>In November 1993, Golson and I, along with a team of archaeology 
students, went to Kuk to meet with the local landowners of the now 
abandoned station, taking with us officers from the Division of Culture and 
Tourism and the Division of Agriculture and Livestock (formerly the 
Division of Primary Industry) of the Western Highlands Provincial 
Government. The objective was to discuss plans for future land use and to 
seek ways of protecting and preserving parts of the Kuk archaeological 
records as national heritage (Strathern and Stewart 1998). Golson and I 
returned in June 1994 to see how things were developing on the ground at 
Kuk, and again in May 1997, after the continued inactivity of the Division 
of Agriculture and Livestock had led to the land being taken over by the 
traditional owners. I myself made annual trips to the site, during which a 
number oflengthy discussions were held about its cultural importance, not 
only to Papua New Guinea but to the history of humanity. 
</p>
<p>The statements from Ongka and Ru set out above emerged from these 
conversations. They address issues of the ownership of ideas and things. In 
the following parts of the chapter I analyse Ongka's statement in the context 
of reciprocity of knowledge and Ru's comments in relationship to the 
ownership of things. 
</p>
<p>Ownership of knowledge 
Kawelka Ongka developed a long-term relationship with the archaeologists 
who came to work at the Kuk site, as he had done previously with social 
anthropologists, especially Andrew Strathern, who were independently 
engaged in studies of the Kawelka community. He appeared in four films and 
published his own autobiography, translated by Andrew Strathern at his 
behest (Ongka 1979). The products of this relationship-exchanges of ideas, 
information and materials--ensured both fame for the researchers and an 
increase in Ongka's own standing within his culture. Yet notwithstanding 
this, Onkga's comments question the role of anthropologists in the

<p>production of knowledge about Kuk and the benefits that should flow 
to him as an informant. 
</p>
<p>Responses to foreign researchers in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>The discipline of anthropology has a long history of involvement in Papua 
New Guinea. Anthropology developed at a time when few parts of the 
world had been unaffected by European colonisation. Papua New Guinea's 
fame in the anthropological world during the first half of the twentieth 
century stemmed from perceptions that it was one of the last untouched 
frontiers for anthropologists. 
</p>
<p>The exposure of tribal groups in Papua New Guinea to research work has 
generated considerable criticism. Andrew Strathern (1985) has usefully 
summarised some of these criticisms and many of them are addressed in his 
writings. They include 
&bull; anthropological writing demeans the indigenous communities as primitive 
&bull; anthropology has been intimately linked to the colonial order 
&bull; knowledge gained through research is exploited in the form of books and 
</p>
<p>articles 
&bull; the field has no practical value. 
</p>
<p>The proposition that anthropology is linked to the colonial order is lent 
some weight by historical circumstance. Anthropology has traditionally been 
an avenue for the West to express its views of other cultures. Non-literate 
and non-industrial 'primitive' cultures, organised on a small scale, were 
contrasted with the complexities of the modern industrial world. As such, 
early anthropology provided a scientific justification for colonial domination 
by European powers. 
</p>
<p>Strathern argues that although anthropology may have had Eurocentric 
roots, by 1950 its major contribution was to promote decolonisation. 
Anthropologists did not assist the colonial regimes directly, and colonials 
generally treated them as outsiders in the European network. Remarking on 
his own role, Strathern (1985:171) commented: 'I did not exactly feel, then, 
that 1 was at the very hub of the wheel of colonialism at this time'. Still the 
fact remains that he came into contact with the natives as a European first. 
</p>
<p>For if it is true that no production of knowledge in the human sciences can ever 
ignore or disclaim its author's involvement as a human subject in his own 
circumstances, then it must also be true that for a European or American 
studying the Orient [the Melpal there can be no disclaiming the main 
circumstances of his actuality: that he comes up against the Orient [the Melpal 
as a European or American first, as an individual second (Said 1991: 11). 
</p>
<p>100 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Ownership of ideas and things 
</p>
<p>Over the years, indigenous and foreign scholars have debated these 
issues. A number of indigenous academics and others have questioned 
the rationale, justification and benefits to be gained from researching 
tribal communities, including Morauta (1979) and Talyaga (1974). 
Concerns about exploitation feature prominently among them. On this 
issue too, Strathern (1985) offers an opposing viewpoint. He argues that 
it is usually educated Papua New Guineans who dislike the idea of PhDs 
(cast in this context as commodities) being manufactured from the raw 
material of knowledge about traditional societies. He labels this kind of 
rationality as 'zero sum thinking', and argues that 'a PhD should not simply 
be seen as an absolute gain to the person who obtains it', because 'a thesis 
can be written so as to be interesting to those who are its subjects' (Strathern 
1985: 174). The pontification by national elites is an unnecessary charge, he 
says, and urges them to team up with expatriate colleagues to concentrate 
on salvage anthropology, otherwise the knowledge might be lost forever. 
</p>
<p>However, the comments about intellectual property made by Ongka 
and Ru are not those of educated eIites, but come from the people who, 
Strathern says, know the situation and base their comments on 'perceived 
reciprocity or the lack of it' (Strathern 1985: 173). Strathern defends his 
research work on the basis that people living in Mt Hagen think it is 'a good 
thing I had written so many books and articles because these carried their 
own names outwards, and also brought many visitors back to them' 
(Strathern 1985: 173). If this is so, why did Ongka say 'you come here to 
make money out of my ideas and things'? 
</p>
<p>Reciprocity: the cultural context of knowledge 
</p>
<p>Ongka's perspective is that his intellectual creativity represents an 
investment in the future, like a seed. If it is successful, and the tree that 
grows from his seed bears fruit, then those who have benefited from the 
fruit will be indebted to him as the source person. This corresponds to 
the Wahgi concept of reproductive kinship incorporating roots (uncles), 
base (mother) and transplants. In this context, transplants are always 
indebted to their source people for their own wellbeing. From Ongka's 
perspective, it was through him as a source person that others have 
attained fame, status and wealth (Muke 1992; O'Hanlon and Frankland 
1986). Therefore researchers were indebted to him. 
</p>
<p>Marilyn Strathern (1996:23) puts it this way: 'Like wind-borne seeds 
success (texts) is measured by the numbers of sites at which it grows'. 
Ongka felt that he was an equal partner in the sowing of seeds-or, to use 
</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Marilyn Strathern's phrase, the 'dispersal of knowledge' -and he had 
high expectations of an obligation to receive at a later stage. In one sense 
therefore, the concept of originator that is familiar in an intellectual 
property context finds an unlikely parallel with a society based on 
exchange mechanisms. Yet, in the context of ongoing reciprocity, it can 
be difficult to distinguish who is the producer of the knowledge that is 
the useable product. 
</p>
<p>Attitudes to researchers in the Wahgi 
When Ongka was a young boy, there were very few anthropological 
records relating to the Hageners of the Wahgi Valley, where the Kuk 
basin is located. Early descriptions of its society were made by 
missionaries and patrol officers entering the region after it was opened 
up to colonial exploration in the 1930s. During the 1970s, it was 
hardly possible to keep abreast of research findings relating to the 
Central Highlands of Papua New Guinea (Brown 1978:264). By the 
1980s, there were few peoples and areas that remained unstudied; 
several had been studied more than once. Researchers began to turn 
their attention elsewhere, perhaps in recognition that the Highlands, 
once a region of exciting anthropological prospect, was finally a bit 
'overexposed' (Feil 1987:2). 
</p>
<p>Ongka was part of the generation in which too much anthropology was 
done. For this reason it is intriguing that he directed his questions about the 
use of knowledge not to those he had worked with, but to myself, a third-
wave anthropologist (or rather, a first-wave native studying himself). 
Perhaps Ongka was aware from the beginning that he was involved in the 
production of knowledge that had the potential to be created and 
transformed into something else. Marilyn Strathern (1996) says that 
potential becomes an asset, and establishing intellectual property is one way 
of securing control over the potential life of creative ideas with reference to 
both their production and their future. 
</p>
<p>In the Highlands, the politics of reciprocity govern expectations abour 
social relations. The giving of a gift creates the potential to return something 
at a later stage, whether the value inherent in the gift is higher or lower than 
the previous gift which it reciprocates. Ifhe knowingly accepted the way (he 
thinks) he was exploited, then Ongka probably did so because he felt himself 
to be in a situation in which the rules of perceived reciprocity applied. 
</p>
<p>The reason why knowledge is now perceived to have been stolen may 
lie in the way the inhabitants of the Wahgi perceive white men 
</p>
<p>102 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Ownership of ideas and things 
</p>
<p>(Connolly and Anderson 1987). The Hageners perceived Europeans as 
'manifestations of light-skinned sky beings ... [who were] the ultimate 
source behind the power of social groups to reproduce themselves' 
(Strathern 1984:20). Despite Andrew Strathern's argument that his 
entry into the Wahgi Valley had nothing to do with the process of 
colonisation, but rather coincided with the process of decolonisation, it 
is nevertheless true that, as a European, he would have been credited 
with being part of the 'origin people' (in Melpa pulk-wamb), the true 
owners of exotic material items-steel, clothes, valua-bles, food and 
equipment. The class and ideological differences among the Europeans 
may not have been apparent to the Hageners. For them, white men all 
came from the same tribe. The Hagen ideas about perceived recip-rocity 
enabled Ongka to place Strathern in the position of a source person. He 
may have rationalised that through himself as the potential customer, 
recipient or 'path person', Western wealth would be channelled, reproduced, 
embedded and redistributed in the Kawelka sociopolitical settings. 
</p>
<p>An important factor about reciprocity is that it involves interpersonal 
relations between individuals who are expected to place themselves 
symmetrically; at birth they are equals and they engage in exchanges as equal 
partners. For the duration of this relationship, as they exchange information, 
ideas, food, material wealth and so forth, the role of ' originator-of-the-
concept' shifts between a network of credit and debt relations. A credit is 
created when one gives gifts in the form of ideas, spiritual blessings, 
transferring of divine planting substances, daughters in marriage and so 
forth. The recipient must feel compelled to make a return at a later stage but 
not necessarily to the exact value-rather the aim is to cement the 
continuation of an existing social relationship. The original donor may feel 
that the exact value of the initial gift is not matched by the recipient but 
this really does not matter, so long as one gets something in return for 
previous debts. Some credit-debit relations are short-term; others, like the 
inheritance of divine substances, carry over several generations. A 
relationship between the scholar and the informant may have ended when 
the former completed the fieldwork, but the informant would still have an 
expectation about sharing in the products of the scholarship. 
</p>
<p>This may be one of the reasons why Ongka featured in four films and was 
the subject of several books, whereby the notion of stealing ideas and things 
became only secondary, but could be activated if positive relations turned 
into negative reciprocity. He may have expected that the scholars who 
worked with him would ensure he received returns from the products of 
'useable knowledge'.

</p>
<p>Relationships between researchers and subjects 
It is extremely difficult for researchers to maintain long-term 
relationships with their informants because of 'the demands of their 
career, family, and society' (Strathern 1985:173). 
</p>
<p>Outside the context of the fieldwork interaction, the relationship between 
the researcher and the subject changes. Taken from this perspective, the 
relationship can be usefully analysed using two of the three property 
ownership categories suggested by Marilyn Strathern (1996). I have 
recontextualised them as different levels of reciprocity: the originator of the 
products of collective life (cultural property rights) and the creator-producer 
of the products of useable knowledge (intellectual property rights). 
</p>
<p>The subject of research may have earnestly believed that he had found a 
new partner of equivalence who came from the source of the exotic items of 
wealth-pulk wamb (origin, roots or source people). However, what the 
subject did not know is that his new exchange partner had concealed his 
background, unconsciously or otherwise, and assumed a role of equivalence 
with the natives around him. Within his own culture, the researcher was 
born into an unequal position (lower or upper class and so on), and 
competes with others in a learning institution. His adventure into the 
Wahgi, for example, is an indication that he had successfully surpassed his 
own colleagues, and reached a level of success that entitled him to enjoy the 
fruits of his intellectual labour. 
</p>
<p>Behind this presumed reciprocity, the natives were unaware that these 
strangers felt free to use alien categories-the first betrayal of the principle of 
equivalence-to record and observe their lives. The researchers would look 
beyond the proverbs, parabolic expressions, rhetorical devices, pointed 
anecdotes and so forth, but instead of finding individuals in personal relation-
ships, would look for the underlying structures and functions of their actions. 
</p>
<p>While Ongka and the researchers may have talked at length, in the end he 
was only a useful resource person-an object-to which preconceived 
Western notions of empirical research were applied in order to separate him 
as an individual from the creative manifestations of himself and the 
behaviour associated with these manfiestations. 
</p>
<p>Ownership of books and notebooks 
</p>
<p>When the fieldwork season was over, the symmetrical relationships 
between the researchers and informants effectively came to an end. 
While the informants continued the ordinary aspects of their lives, the 
</p>
<p>104 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Ownership of ideas and things 
</p>
<p>researchers went away with notebooks filled with observed primary data 
which would help them establish themselves in their own culture as 
members of the academic tribal community. The relationships they had 
left behind had been replaced instead by an expectation on the part of 
the informants about the nature of their future relationship. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest promise of the future-or obligation to return a 
gift-lies in the writing of books and articles. Obviously a book is of no 
immediate benefit to the studied community, unless the children of the 
informants learn to speak the language in which it is written. It is the writer 
who obtains ownership (through copyright) of the products of exchanged 
knowledge, because a text book is an object, like an archaeological artifact. 
Because these are tangible products, Ongka's claims of ownership are 
discredited. He may be the source, the originator of ideas-in much the 
same way as he credited the Europeans (or more specifically Strathern) as the 
source of European items-but he does not control the product as his 
property. Because his ideas are intangible he cannot prove ownership in a 
specific way. 
</p>
<p>The distinction between intangible ideas and the tangible products of 
their expression becomes less clear in the case of primary data. If Ongka does 
not have a stake in the books, what about the material contained in 
anthropological notebooks before it leaves an indigenous community? The 
notebooks are the property of the researcher and the primary data in itself is 
not valuable. The material is more a potential asset-like technology that 
transforms ideas into a visible form-and it is the creativity of the researcher 
that transforms it into a product that mayor may not generate future 
returns. However, a book is also an indirect reflection of the relationship 
between the researchers and informants (and others). If the researchers are 
sponsored by academic institutions, those bodies may claim ownership of 
the product, or at least the researchers are obliged to make some return 
payments. 
</p>
<p>Marilyn Strathern says that, in order for a product to be of benefit, it has 
to meet contemporary demands. In most cases, books do not make money, 
and the ideas contained in such products have to travel along networks, the 
'seeds of dispersed knowledge', so that they can grow in a number of sites. 
To establish a relationship between a producer and a product, the text-as-
property must be identified as originating from the native source. Once the 
product (text) is distanced from the source, the cultural knowledge comes to 
be identified with the writers of the text. Arguably, Marilyn Strathern's 
distinction between the products of collective life and products of useable 
</p>
<p>105 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>knowledge parallels the separation between scholars and natives, In this 
regard, it is suggested that Ongka's claims of ownership rest upon the 
concept of control of cultural knowledge as products of collective life-
recognisable objects (culture) and recognisable claims (identity). The 
validity of this proposal is supported by the preamble of the 
Constitution of Papua New Guinea, which says that we 'pay homage 
to the memory of our ancestors-the source of our strength and 
origin of our combined heritage' and 'acknowledge the worthy 
customs and traditional wisdoms of our people', and for Ongka it 
provides some basis for the claim of ownership of transmissibility of 
cultural knowledge over time. 
</p>
<p>A bottle of kerosene 
</p>
<p>Ongka did teach me one lesson. It is that we, the natives, have no way of 
evaluating outsiders and their involvement in our affairs, or what it means 
for our relationships with them (which take place within our own social 
setting) that they have associations, beliefs and social positions as members 
of another society (cf Said 1991:10). 
</p>
<p>Until recently, those studied by anthropologists have accepted passively 
the right of outsiders to speak for them from an outside, a European, point 
of view. The cultures they created for us-for example, Melpa, Kuma and 
Chimbu-were manifestations of their own perceptions and personalities. 
For a period anthropological researchers enjoyed the hospitality of those 
they studied, but now people are increasingly aware of property ownership 
and no one can speak for Ongka, rather he spoke for himself to me in a 
plain language-the ownership of ideas and things. 
</p>
<p>However, one never can understand the politics of reciprocity; tomorrow 
Ongka may change his mind and say 'Andrew is a very nice person, because 
he helped me; and it is good that he wrote many books because other people 
know about us'. On one occasion Onkga coerced me to buy a botde of 
kerosene for him, and he said 'now you know our ways better than them'. 
This is how intellectual property as an embodiment of exchanged ideas is 
embedded in social relations and should be appreciated among the 
community of intellectuals. If we are serious about intellectual property 
rights, we must have at least 700 indigenous anthropologists covering all 
the linguistic groupings in Papua New Guinea and producing their own 
materials; these groups may still cry out for the protection of their ideas 
from acts of intellectual theft.

</p>
<p>Exporting of knowledge 
</p>
<p>Since the closure of the agricultural research station, the status of the 
Kuk historical site has been a cause for concern on the part of National 
Museum staff and archaeologists because of the takeover of the property 
by the original landowners and their subsequent use of the land. The 
threat of destruction has prompted appeals to larger organisations like 
the World Heritage Commission, for recognition of the site as one of 
importance to the history of humanity (Strathern and Stewart 1998). 
Jack Golson's concern about this issue brought him out of retirement to 
make several self-sponsored trips to Papua New Guinea (between 1994 
and 1997). 
</p>
<p>The archaeological records at Kuk are situated within the boundaries of 
land owned by the Department of Agriculture and Livestock. For most of 
the period during which Kuk was intensively studied, this state ownership 
was assumed to provide a legitimate basis for the National Museum's 
custodianship of the cultural property. The closure of the Kuk station 
provided the foundation for the emergence of a third party interest-the 
original owners of Kuk. The politics of their new role is complicated by 
changing personal dynamics. The people with whom Jack Golson established 
relationships have gone into retirement from their positions of influence, 
and have been replaced by their children, and others, like Ru, who 
participated in the excavations as a young man, have assumed positions of 
influence, wealth and prestige. They have a different view of their 
relationships with government and with researchers. It may be that some of 
them were instrumental in forcing the abandonment of the station and 
obstructing the use of buildings by the provincial authorities. 
</p>
<p>Ru is an important indigenous scholar who, like Ongka, featured in 
several films (Nairn, Strathern and Ongka 1983) and wrote an 
autobiography (also with the help of Andrew Strathern). Ru's comments 
set out at the beginning of this chapter were recorded three years after 
the first village meeting in November 1993. They were directed at Jack 
Golson, whose archaeological work on the prehistoric agricultural 
practices spanned a period of more than 20 years. 
</p>
<p>During the period of academic interest and study at Kuk, Ru associated 
with scholars operating within two quite different fields. Archaeological field 
methodology differs significantly from that of anthropology. It is primarily 
</p>
<p>107 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>concerned with the remains of past societies, rather than tapping into 
the minds and thoughts of living people. As such, there need be little 
interaction between scholars and villagers about the production and 
maintenance of exchanged knowledge. In addition, this preoccupation 
with the past means that knowledge is gathered from observations of the 
physical landscape by researchers with different field expertise from that 
of anthropologists. Consequently, the product of useable knowledge 
comes to be identified closely with the scholars. 
</p>
<p>In contrast, anthropological researchers make repeated visits to the 
studied area and develop long term relations with the living communities. In 
the case of Kuk, they have effectively prevented any questioning about the 
ownership of knowledge by motivating the informants to write books about 
themselves. Practices of this kind were of little significance to the 
archaeologists who studied the site, since they were concerned with a period 
that went beyond the remembered history of the present occupants. 
Whereas Ru could discern some benefits from his social relationship with 
Andrew Strathern, he could see no similar benefit from his relationship with 
Golson. Ru may have felt that he gained recognition and status in 
anthropology but that he was left out in the production of archaeological 
knowledge. It was in this context that he made his remarks. 
</p>
<p>In what way could Jack Golson have left behind knowledge among the 
Kawelka? An anthropologist can contest Ongka's or Ru's comments by 
arguing that he or she gave something in exchange for the initial 
procurement of knowledge. A balance is maintained in which the informants 
and researchers both write books about themselves. Even if scholars had 
narrated the stories of the informants, the latter would still have gained the 
idea of a balance in the exchange of knowledge-equal participation in the 
production of a text. It does not matter if the scholars have written more 
books than the informants, since the ideals of reciprocity are based on 
balanced social relations rather than on exchanges of exact value. 
</p>
<p>The objects that are the archaeologist's 'informants'-like wooden digg-
ing sticks, pollen, sediments and structural features like ditches, fence posts 
and house sites-are mute. They do not talk in the way that Ongka and Ru 
did, but the archaeologists use rigorous scientific methods to make them 
speak for themselves. I suggested earlier that Ongka may have some rights to 
the notebooks of the anthropologist's field visits, since his community enabled 
their creation. When the informants die, taking with them the cultural 
knowledge recorded by the anthropologist, the notebooks may be-come the 
only record that exists of the cultural knowledge of earlier generations.

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Ownership of ideas and things 
</p>
<p>The same cannot be said of archaeologists' field notes. Since the 
knowledge in them is gathered not from the minds of those long gone, 
but from the physical evidence they left behind, the archaeologist's 
notebooks are a simplified model or map to the knowledge; they are not 
the knowledge itself The source of the knowledge is still buried in the 
swamps of Kuk. It is open to any Kawelka who may one day wish to 
follow the steps of Jack Golson and reproduce his or her own version of 
the human activities at Kuk swamp. 
</p>
<p>Recovering old ground 
</p>
<p>For a period after the closure of Kuk station, research work there abated. 
Following the meeting with the local landowners in late 1993, there were 
discussions about restarting archaeological fieldwork at the site. Meanwhile, 
human activity intensified in different parts of the abandoned station. 
However, most of the gardening activity was in the northeastern part, away 
from the southeastern blocks where most of the archaeological investigations 
had been carried out. An agreement was reached with the landowners that if 
there were plans to develop various plots within the station boundaries, the 
National Museum and the University ofPapua New Guinea would be 
informed so as to allow for some salvage archaeological research. 
</p>
<p>What the researchers did not know until after the event was that the 
major clans of the Kawelka and Jika were moving across the boundaries of 
the old station in 1995 and 1996 and dividing the land among themselves-
a process which might have been planned as early as 1990. The leaders of the 
Kawelka did not inform the researchers that this had taken place. It can be 
argued that, rather than hiding the truth, Ru took the view that it was none 
of the researchers' business. Although he concealed this information about 
the tribalisation of the state property, Ru kept his part of the deal. To him, 
four years was enough time for archaeologists to find money to do whatever 
they wanted. Since the blocks were the best land for garden activities and 
Ru's rivals staked claims by gardening in them, he may have been forced to 
make claims for himself. He thus took part in the rapid repossession of the 
property and its subdivision amongst selected family heads in 1996. 
</p>
<p>In November 1996, I visited Kuk with a Japanese television crew who 
were documenting aspects of early agriculture in Papua New Guinea. For 
the first time, I was able to inspect the southeastern part of the station where 
the main archaeological investigations had taken place in the 1970s. Since 
people had cleared the swamp vegetation to prepare gardens, I could see the

<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>traces of large prehistoric channels on the exposed surface; they were too 
deep to be affected by the shallow modern ditches, and were still 
waterlogged. The most disturbing observation was that the area of most 
archaeological interest, the area that ought to be protected, was under 
extensive cultivation, including some plots with coffee trees in various 
stages of maturity. 
</p>
<p>It was apparent that a clever strategy was being used to mask the 
gardening activities taking place on the repossessed land, and hence the 
encroachment on the locations of past archaeological investigations. By 
cultivating in areas which were invisible from nearby vantage points, the 
villagers had ensured that their activities would not be noticed. By the time 
I arrived at the end of 1996, most of the area previously subject to 
archaeological research was covered with food crops, vegetables, coffee trees 
and other trees like Casuarina. It appears that the Kawelka had been 
destroying the tangible evidence left by the previous owners (the state), and 
recreating a new domestic, personalised environment, in order to make a 
political statement about their ownership or reflect a legal claim to the 
control of the Kuk property. By destroying the tangible archaeological 
evidence that might provide a source that could stop them from owning the 
land (Muke 1998; Moutu 1978), the Kawelka placed the integrity of this 
internationally significant cultural heritage site at risk. 
</p>
<p>The battlefield 
</p>
<p>The Kuk station ground is like a traditional battlefield, where the 
imbalanced relations between two hostile groups are contested. In battle, the 
objective is not the permanent acquisition of the land of a defeated group, 
but the total destruction of the tangible evidence of their opponent's cultural 
activity within the territory. The idea is to turn the cultivated cultural 
landscape into a wild, barren no-man's territory. Upon the return to their 
own territory, the defeated group's initial settlements and gardening 
activities are concentrated on portions of territory away from the battle 
frontier. Slowly the settlements progress towards the battlefields, which are 
also closest to the striking positions of the opponents in the event of war. As 
soon as the bulk of the territory is cultivated, the group asserts its 
sociopolitical autonomy as a territorial unit. The lost ground is now 
legally theirs. 
</p>
<p>In their campaign to regain Kuk, Ru's group adopted a similar strategy. 
The state is the enemy whom they accuse of stealing their land through very 
</p>
<p>110 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Ownership of ideas and things 
</p>
<p>cheap deals with their fathers and grandfathers. The hostilities of the 
early 1990s, involving both a war of words and physical confrontations 
with government personnel, was a deliberate attempt to recolonise the 
property from the private ownership (of the state) to communal 
ownership (by the group). To prove that it is legally theirs, the Kawelka 
have to refer to the presence of their own culturally created tangible 
evidence on the landscape. How can they claim that the property is 
their own when the tangible evidence shows the hallmarks of the state's 
legitimate claim of property ownership? 
</p>
<p>The obvious strategy is to destroy most of the tangible records on the 
ground and then create new evidence which is aligned more towards the 
Kawelka's conceptions of a cultural landscape. This is partly what has been 
happening at Kuk over the last decade. The locals have systematically 
destroyed the tangible evidence left by the state. First they felled gum trees, 
occupied residential houses and offices and allowed pigs into the station, 
who bulldozed the land on top of the major drain networks. The next set of 
activities involved the establishment of initial gardens in the boundary zones 
between the state and customary lands, the division of the major blocks 
among the main sub-clans, the assertion of individual claims to plots within 
the main blocks, the replacement of food crops with cash crops (mainly 
coffee trees) and the construction of new houses. 
</p>
<p>At no stage of the domestication process initiated by the villagers did the 
state authorities counter-attack (for example, by sending in police to arrest 
and punish the trouble makers). When wokabaut sawmills were used to fell 
the gum trees, there was no intervention by Division of Agriculture and 
Livestock officers at the provincial level. The Division of Agriculture and 
Livestock's failure to move back into Kuk allowed the people to proceed to 
the final stages of legitimating their tribal ownership by the symbolic act of 
planting coffee trees, not only as economically significant but as permanent 
markers. They are tangible evidence which serve as a bargaining point for a 
large compensation demand from the people in the event of a claim of 
ownership by the state. The question now is, who owns the archaeological 
sites? 
</p>
<p>Ownership of the Kuk site 
</p>
<p>Ru's comments referred to money in terms of the fruits of his labour. He 
saw the fruits of that labour as the save (knowledge) that Golson wrote in 
his notebooks (without Ru's help) and took to Australia. He reproduced it 
</p>
<p>111 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>there, and therefore its indirect benefits were enjoyed by others. Ru 
argues that, since Golson did not leave the knowledge behind, what 
remains in the soil should at least provide some benefit for the future 
generations of the community now there is a pressing need for land. 
Unless someone finds new land for the Kawelka, the Kuk property is 
theirs to keep. 
</p>
<p>Ironically, the tangible records from which the product of useable 
knowledge were created are still in the Kuk swamp. They have been buried 
there for many thousands of years, and the Kawelka are only the 
contemporary owners in a succession of previous owners of the Kuk swamp. 
In other words, Jack Golson only constructed his knowledge from that part 
of save that will always remain the property of the people. It can be argued 
(as is prescribed in the Australian Archaeological Association Code of 
Ethics) that 'the indigenous cultural heritage rightfully belongs to the 
indigenous descendants of that heritage except items given as personal gifts 
to non-indigenous people or given or sold to non-indigenous institutions' 
(Principle 5). If we apply this principle to the Kuk site, it is obvious that it 
remains the property of the traditional landowners. The ancestors left the 
traces behind, and present generations are the custodians of the places, tools 
and other resources used by their ancestors, as part of a single social 
continuum. From this perspective, the decision to protect, conserve and 
promote that aspect of the eroding culture must be in the hands of the 
indigenous people themselves. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps Ru is aware of this-it may not be a total coincidence that his 
plots are in the area that has received intensive archaeological attention. He 
has indicated that scientists may use his land free of charge, but will 
have to negotiate the rest with other landowners. The problem for 
archaeologists is that there are more than 50 owners of plots within the 
several blocks which are of interest to archaeology. A researcher would 
need to get permission from several individuals to do any kind of 
investigations. There are real questions now about how to protect the 
source of primary data for future returns, when it is in the ownership of 
so many individuals. It is cultural property which can bring direct and 
indirect benefits to the community. Unfortunately, the custodianship or 
ownership of cultural resource materials has become confused with the 
economic value of the swamps themselves, and the cash crops which can 
be grown within them. Only a significant effort at public education will 
change the attitude of the people on that issue. 
</p>
<p>112 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Ownership of ideas and things 
</p>
<p>Other cases 
As the idea of making money from land becomes more and more 
entrenched, the idea of selling objects of history from the surface of the 
ground becomes increasingly attractive. The emerging economic significance 
attached to items of cultural value raises issues about the loss of this cultural 
heritage. Kuk is only the most prominent of several cases of conflict between 
economic interest and cultural heritage that have arisen in the Wahgi region 
alone over recent years. These have involved the sale of objects of cultural 
significance, like stone axes and wooden spades discovered during drainage, 
and also claims for compensation to be paid before investigations could be 
made at the sites of such discoveries. 
</p>
<p>Particularly instructive is the case of Kana near Minj. I chose this area for 
my own investigations, because I thought that my personal connections 
might enable me to avoid the difficulties arising from the demands for 
money which had been encountered in other places. Several sites were 
located, and archaeological investigations were carried out at two of them. 
In 1993 and 1994 I had no problems gaining access to the Kana site (Muke 
n.d.), partly because of a very good relationship with the plantation manager 
and partly because the coffee plantation was still seen as company property. 
However, by 1995 the loan was fully repaid and there was internal conflict 
among the local landowner groups. The company was dissolved and the 
coffee plantation was divided among the people themselves. The areas of 
specific archaeological interest have been divided among three families. 
While one family approved of the archaeological work in the area, the other 
demanded payments. Since 1995 I have been forced to make small financial 
contributions to the coffee owners in order to have access to this important 
site. Should this practice be discouraged or encouraged? This is a question 
to which I cannot provide any immediate answer. 
</p>
<p>Conclusion 
Swamplands like those of the Wahgi Valley are a non-renewable 
resource, an ecological museum and an extraordinarily important relic in 
the cultural landscape library for scientific study. Because they are 
permanently waterlogged and too deep to be affected by the fluctuating 
water table, the swamps contain layers of humic organic deposits which 
are effectively sealed in a wet and airless environment. This favours their 
preservation, as long as the waterlogging is more or less permanent up to

<p>the time of exposure (Renfrew and Bahn 1991). The different phases of 
past swamp cultivation are registered at different levels of deposits by 
the superimposition of one layer of sediment on the other when the 
ditches of an earlier period of drained agriculture were filled in and 
covered over by sediment during a following period of abandonment 
(Golson 1982). 
</p>
<p>The challenge to preserve Kuk as a heritage site is contested by the 
traditional landowners. One has to seriously think about Ru's comments 
</p>
<p>It is hard for me to try and stop them from destroying the prehistoric sites. You 
know when they have already made their gardens, they will ask you for money 
if you want to excavate on their land. 
</p>
<p>Archaeologists are in an even more difficult position in trying to stop 
destruction at the national level. If Ru as a local leader cannot change the 
opinion of the owners, who can? The potential for selling archaeological 
heritage items or paying for access to the sites or sources of knowledge is 
becoming an enterprise activity in itself. 
</p>
<p>Coffee production is a high export income earner and Highlanders often 
refer to it as a pot of gold. They equate coffee with mineral resources. 
Compensation is awarded to landowners with mineral deposits, and people 
are aware that multinational companies pay for trees, bushes and anything 
of significance destroyed. Why should it not be the same for archaeological 
research in the swamplands? Such underlying rationality has influenced 
people to salvage genuine archaeological objects and sell them for cash, and 
they have demanded that archaeologists pay them first before they 
investigate the appearance of past cultural activities in these former swamps. 
</p>
<p>At present, it is only through goodwill and appreciation by the people 
themselves of the importance of cultural heritage that sites on the landscape 
are left undisturbed. Kuk is a valuable case study, and illustrates the wider 
problems of destruction of heritage. There are a number of ways to address 
these problems. They include introducing acts and policies on cultural 
property and heritage management, recommending World Heritage 
listing and conducting scientific investigations which would add a final 
chapter to Golson's version of the agricultural history of the Highlands. 
Unless efforts like these are made, the existence of Kuk (and sites of 
similar antiquity) will only be remembered on paper.

Stealing music from/in Papua 
</p>
<p>New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Don Niles 
</p>
<p>In contrast to the theft of intellectual, biological and most cultural 
properties, which occurs for the most part from Papua New Guinea, the 
theft of music works both ways-there are overseas thefts of Papua New 
Guinea music, but also Papua New Guinean thefts of overseas music. 
Any discussion of cultural property rights must take this into account. 
This chapter deliberately uses the words 'theft' and 'stealing'. In 
addition to being shorter and more dramatic than the phrase 'cultural 
property rights', it has more relevance, since it is only when people feel 
they have been wronged that questions of rights arise. 
</p>
<p>Traditional Papua New Guinean societies have ways of defining the 
rights of performance of music and dance, and also ways of dealing with 
transgressions. Yet because these systems seemingly function quite well, 
they are not a concern when it comes to the public voicing of questions 
about rights to performance. More of an issue is the theft of Papua New 
Guinean music by non-traditional groups. This generally falls into two 
areas-theft of traditional music by people from overseas and the theft 
of popular music (for example, stringband and powerband music) by 
other Papua New Guinean groups or overseas bands or organisations. 
Other thefts are possible, including the appropriation of traditional 
music by stringbands. Although this has not received the same level of 
publicity, it is certainly a concern raised by some elders when faced with 
the possibility of their sacred music being debased by a stringband. 
</p>
<p>Copyright concerns in Papua New Guinea have generally focused on 
the assumption that overseas artists are 'ripping off' local artists. While 
</p>
<p>116 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Stealing music from/in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>this has certainly happened, what is more common is the theft of 
overseas music by Papua New Guinean musicians. Both must be 
considered. The issue that has drawn the greatest attention and is the 
subject of most heated calls for copyright legislation is the unauthorised 
use of Papua New Guinean music by overseas groups, including bands, 
individuals and companies. The theft of Papua New Guinea music by 
other Papua New Guinean musicians has to be considered as well. 
</p>
<p>The use of Papua New Guinean music by overseas artists is nothing 
new-musicians have always sought new ideas from foreign music. In 
1921, Emanuel Aarons published piano and voice arrangements of music 
recorded in Papua New Guinea by the Australian traveller Frank Hurley. 
The Australian composer Alfred Hill also made piano and voice arrange-
ments of Papua New Guinean songs, although the results might not 
sound Papua New Guinean. The famous French composer Olivier 
Messiaen dedicated his piano composition Quatre etudes de rythme to the 
island of Papua, supposedly inspired by Papua New Guinean rhythms, 
and later incorporated Papua New Guinean birdsongs in one of his last 
orchestral works. More recently, Sr Duchesne Lavin has written many 
arrangements of Papua New Guinean songs, Mauricio Kagel has incorp-
orated Papua New Guinean instruments in his compositions, Lanse 
Taudevin premiered his Cantata Buka in 1982 and Christopher Roberts 
wrote a Symphony bilong Papua. None of these compositions (see also the 
Annex) have raised much concern over the question of rights. 
</p>
<p>Questions about rights really only come into the spotlight when 
Papua New Guinean music is used-by popular musicians, in films or 
in other media-and the thieves have the potential to earn significant 
amounts of money. Papua New Guinean music has been misused in a 
variety of ways for differing commercial ventures. Complaints can be 
divided into three, occasionally overlapping categories. 
</p>
<p>Use of materials without permission 
While all three categories concern lack of permission, the first category 
concerns the use of recordings, whether published or not, in new 
contexts or the commercial release of music previously not available 
commercially. In any case, the music is used without the permission of 
the collector or performer. Examples abound of such abuse within Papua 
New Guinea as one band complains about another band's theft of their 
songs, particularly after the latter has just released a cassette. Although 
most frequently applied to songs, theft of this kind is also reported for 
</p>
<p>117 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>styles, for example, complaints that a certain stringband has copied the 
style of the Paramana Strangers or makes use of a bamboo band in an 
area where such ensembles are otherwise unknown. 
</p>
<p>While permission may be received for the reproduction of materials, 
the resulting product may be a curious mixture. For example, recordings 
from my own institute were used in a CD-ROM about the Maring 
people. However, while the colour photos and text on the CD-ROM do 
indeed concern the Maring, the recordings are of Enga music (Clarke 
1995). 
</p>
<p>Unauthorised use also occurs in films. The Australian film To Have 
and To Hold uses Kaluli recordings made by anthropologist Steven Feld, 
apparently used without authorisation. The CD of the soundtrack lacks 
these examples, but does include a recording of Raun Raun Theatre, also 
allegedly used without permission (Raun Raun Theatre 1996: track 8), 
as well as recordings of Highlands flutes from an unknown source. 
</p>
<p>Rerecording of a popular music song 
The rerecording of overseas popular music is a common practice in 
Papua New Guinea. Local groups simply record their version of a 
commercially released overseas hit. These are generally called 'cover 
versions' or simply 'covers'. Covers are an essential way of learning to 
make music, and sometimes the transformations of the original songs 
can be quite substantial, as in the wonderful reworking of Elvis's Always 
on My Mind by Gaba Kaluks (1985) in their song Vero. 
</p>
<p>The theft of popular Papua New Guinean songs by overseas artists is 
exemplified by Papua New Guinea's most well known and well 
publicised case of music theft-the theft of the Sanguma song Yalikoe by 
the Black Brothers, a band originally from Irian Jaya who resided in 
Papua New Guinea berween 1979 and 1980. The band locally released 
a number of versions of Papua New Guinean pop songs, and then 
enjoyed a considerable success in Holland in 1982 with their version of 
the song (called Jalikoe), reportedly reaching third place on a European 
disco chart (Niles 1996). Sanguma's (1978) original version of Yalikoe is 
an arrangement of a traditional song from Maprik, performed by men to 
give them confidence and energy before going out to hunt. Sanguma's 
version demonstrates a conscious attempt to incorporate Papua New 
Guinea instruments and includes a garamut introduction. Further, there 
is a considerable difference berween Sanguma's unaccompanied vocal 
section and that by the Black Brothers, which has been made without 
</p>
<p>118 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Stealing music from/in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>the use of Papua New Guinean instruments, creating a more 
international dance sound. 
</p>
<p>Although this was obviously straight theft by the Black Brothers 
without compensation to Sanguma, there does not seem to have been 
any discussion about what people from Maprik feel about the use of 
their traditional song as originally adopted by Sanguma. 
</p>
<p>Manipulation of recordings 
A recording may be electronically manipulated (for example, by 
overdubbing or sampling) by musicians in the studio, creating a new 
sound. In contrast to the other two categories, this rarely occurs within 
Papua New Guinea. Overseas, it is an increasingly common type of 
music theft and Papua New Guinean music has been involved. In 1972, 
Pink FIoyd mixed fragments of Papua New Guinean music for the sound 
track to a film called The Valley Obscured by Clouds (Pink Floyd 1972). 
</p>
<p>More recently, some of the Institute of Papua New Guinea Studies' 
own recordings have been used by a group in Germany called Miracle 
G(y)rlz, described on their World Wide Web home page as: 'Two guys 
born in Papua New Guinea with finnish [sic] parents and a drummer 
from Lithuania + melodic psycho-folk-punk-rock sculptures + hi-energy 
live-performance + intensity through 66 tracks!' (Miracle G(y)rlz nd). 
The Australian band Not Drowning, Waving began experimenting with 
their own recordings of Papua New Guinean music, eventually leading 
to their notable collaborations with George Telek (Not Drowning, 
Waving 1986, 1987, 1990a, 1990b, 1991a and 1991b). Finally, an 
Australian group, Drum Drum, has recently added tracks and modified 
recordings of Central and Manus music (Drum Drum 1996). 
</p>
<p>The most famous and commercially successful example of the 
manipulation of a recording of traditional music from the Pacific comes 
from Papua New Guinea's near neighbour, Solomon Islands. In 1969 a 
Swiss ethnomusicologist made recordings among the Baegu people on 
Malaita Island and released some of his recordings on a UNESCO disc 
in 1973 (Zemp 1973:track 8). Among them was a rorogwela lullaby, 
often sung not by the mother, but by the child's elder sister. The lyrics 
ask the baby not to cry because its parents are dead and no one else can 
hear the crying. The melody is familiar to many people as the origin of 
the track called Sweet Lullaby, released by Deep Forest in 1992. 
</p>
<p>In addition to being a major international hit, selling millions in the 
United States and Europe, and being nominated for a Grammy award, 
</p>
<p>119 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Deep Forest's song has been used in advertisements for Sony, Coca-Cola 
and Porsche. As has been well documented by the ethnomusicologist 
who originally recorded the work and others (Zemp 1996:44-9; Mills 
1996:59-60; Feld 2000), Deep Forest (consisting of two Frenchmen) 
never received any permission for the use or manipulation of these 
recordings. No money has ever been received by UNESCO or by the 
ethnomusicologist who made the original recordings, and certainly no 
money has ever gone back to Munakwa, the woman who sang the 
lullaby 23 years earlier. 
</p>
<p>Responding to thefts 
These examples illustrate the types of theft that have occurred, and are 
likely to occur more commonly in the future, particularly as more 
individuals are able to make recordings and more recordings of Papua 
New Guinean music are available commercially. What can be done 
about this? 
</p>
<p>It has been suggested by many local musicians that Papua New 
Guinea must have a copyright law. In fact, Papua New Guinea does have 
a copyright law, although it is unenforceable. Reasons for this have been 
detailed by Nonggorr (1990; see also Niles 1992). But there are 
drawbacks too. If Papua New Guinea were to subscribe to international 
copyright legislation it would mean the end of cheap cassettes of 
overseas music. The price of a Michael Jackson, Abba or Don Williams 
cassette would probably triple, making them much too expensive for 
many consumers. Some may argue that such measures would benefit the 
local music industry, yet while there is no doubt of the popularity of 
some Papua New Guinean bands, would listeners be willing to abandon 
their favourite overseas bands in trade? 
</p>
<p>Traditional Papua New Guinean societies frequently had clear rules 
about ownership of music and dance and the procedures required to 
obtain the rights to perform it (Niles 1992). It is a feature of many 
groups within Papua New Guinea that they perform music that 
originates from outside their own area and this foreign origin is well 
acknowledged. This often accounts for the unintelligibility of the texts 
to present-day performers. Sometimes such music and dance is simply 
learned from neighbouring groups; perhaps more often, however, the 
rights to performance are purchased with traditional valuables, and the 
music is taught to the purchasers, ensuring that it is learnt properly. 
Much more is involved than just correct singing and dance movements-
</p>
<p>120 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Stealing music from/in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>appropriate magic, taboos, decorations, rhythms and so on are essential. 
The buying and selling of rights to perform music seem to be 
particularly associated with the Mamose region, although examples 
could probably be found in all provinces. 
</p>
<p>Simply because there are mechanisms in place for the proper purchase 
of the rights of performance does not mean that thefts of music and 
dance do not take place. Traditional law provides ways to handle 
transgressions of this kind. While the Institute of Papua New Guinea 
Studies has received many general descriptions of such laws and the 
penalties associated with breaking them, to my knowledge there is 
nothing written in detail about how such systems operate. 
</p>
<p>Any group considering the preparation of laws for the protection of 
intellectual, biological and cultural rights should undertake a careful 
review of traditional counterparts. Unfortunately there is no detailed 
data of this kind, at least in the area of music. Documentation of these 
rules and practices is of prime importance. Perhaps in contrast to many 
of the other issues concerning intellectual property rights, there are 
traditional means of dealing with questions of ownership of music and 
dance. For this reason, it is important to know how these systems 
operate. Traditional Papua New Guinean societies have approached these 
issues in different ways. Knowledge will, hopefully, provide a basis for 
legislators to make informed suggestions about drafting laws to reflect 
these important precedents. 
</p>
<p>A comprehensive review of traditional intellectual property regimes 
will take time, but other steps can be taken now. Researchers (defined 
very broadly) should evaluate their own ethics when doing fieldwork in 
Papua New Guinea. While researchers must obviously be responsible for 
explaining the intended use of materials they collect, Papua New 
Guineans also need to be informed about these issues by someone other 
than researchers, so they can ask the right questions. This can be 
achieved by developing respect for and knowledge of the diversity of 
Papua New Guinean traditions, so creating a more informed populace. 
While people may still be eager to display their proud traditions, they 
need to be informed enough to enquire about possible uses of recordings 
or videos made of them. Politicians, as the controllers of money, need to 
be educated that cultural traditions are not something only to be 
praised at election time, but must be financially supported through the 
local institutions that engage in research on these traditions. The 
National Cultural Commission has taken important steps in recent years 
</p>
<p>121 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>to promote Papua New Guinean cultures. It has also been exploring the 
use of cultural performances as a way of generating income for the prac-
titioners themselves, thereby encouraging the maintenance of traditions. 
</p>
<p>While most researchers are very responsible, some are not. A require-
ment for research is that the results of research be sent back to appropriate 
institutions in Papua New Guinea. Some researchers fail to meet even 
this minimal requirement, much less return copies of their publications 
to the groups they have worked with. This must be monitored more 
closely by institutions responsible for the processing of research visas, 
especially the National Research Institute. Researchers must ensure that 
copies of every article, book, recording, film and video they produce are 
available in Papua New Guinea. If they do not deposit copies and 
cannot prove that they have done so, they should not be allowed into 
the country for further research until this situation is rectified. 
</p>
<p>Encouraging researchers to be ethically responsible is important, but 
researchers are usually not the greatest cause for concern. Rather, 
overseas bands looking for new sounds to sample or films needing to fill 
out their soundtrack with Papua New Guinean music are the most 
worrisome. As compact discs have become a standard medium and are 
relatively cheap, the sounds of music from different parts of the world 
have become more available than ever before. This is very exciting for 
any music lover, but it means that it is very easy to steal music from 
these kinds of recordings. Because of the huge numbers of recordings 
made, it is very difficult to know what has been done unless some 
commercial success is achieved by the thieves. Discussion needs to 
continue about whether Papua New Guinea should embrace 
international copyright conventions, given that these trends are likely to 
escalate in the future. 
</p>
<p>Conclusion 
The importance of learning about traditional methods for the protection 
of cultural rights as a guide to future deliberations on this subject 
cannot be underestimated. It is also crucial to encourage education and 
awareness of what has occurred and to understand the possibilities of 
further occurences in the future. Making traditional music inaccessible 
to outsiders (local or overseas) deprives Papua New Guineans of an 
important symbol of their identity, yet this identity must be protected 
from distortion through ignorance, greed or lack of respect for these 
traditions.

Plant genetic resources of 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea 
some thoughts on intellectual 
</p>
<p>property rights 
</p>
<p>RN Kambuou 
</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years, there has been an increasing interest and 
enthusiasm for biodiversity prospecting and the development of natural 
products throughout the world. The exploration of biodiversity for 
commercially valuable genetic resources has the potential to encourage 
conservation and to provide economic benefits to developing countries 
and their local communities. However, despite the interest and rapidly 
increasing number of biodiversity prospectors, there are no clear national 
policies or legislation in place to govern and regulate biodiversity 
prospecting in Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>This chapter discusses forms of law that might provide protection for 
intellectual property rights in plant genetic resources. It also discusses 
international undertakings and agreements that support individual 
countries' efforts to establish these kinds of protection. 
</p>
<p>Plant genetic resources in Papua New Guinea 
It is estimated that Papua New Guinea contains more than 5 per cent 
of the world's total biodiversity, in less than 1 per cent of its land area. 
The country is also one of the world centres of diversification of 
traditional root and tuber crops, leafY vegetables, fruits and nuts, 
cooking bananas, underutilised food crops, sugarcane, medicinal 
plants, ornamental trees and timber trees. These are a rich and 
valuable resource that must be appropriately utilised and conserved for 
future generations. 
</p>
<p>125 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>While this diversity is still largely intact, genetic erosion is taking 
place at an alarming rate in some places, mainly caused by urbanisation 
and increased lumbering, mining and agriculture activities. Mining and 
logging operations are changing the lifestyle of villages to that of a cash 
economy, and the indigenous diversity of crops is gradually being lost. 
The underutilised food crops and medicinal plant resources are 
disappearing as the older generations who are the users of these 
germplasms die, while the younger generations move to urban centres 
and mining sites. Valuable indigenous knowledge about the use of these 
plant varieties is vanishing with the older generation. 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea has approximately 38 million hectares of forest, 
spreading over 60 per cent of the country's land mass, of which more 
than 97 per cent is customarily owned by the indigenous inhabitants 
(Swartzendruber 1993). These forest habitats contain the country's 
valuable forest tree resources. Indigenous timber tree species include the 
Araucaria spp., Agathis spp., Eucalyptus spp., Acasia spp. and some exotic 
species such as Tectona grandis, Gmelina arborea and Ochroma lagopus. 
</p>
<p>There are more than 600 medicinal plants reportedly used in Papua 
New Guinea (Holdsworth 1977). Almost all these plants grow wild in 
their natural habitats and are collected by villagers whenever medical 
needs arise. The forest habitats of the country, particularly the rainforest 
areas, are rich storehouses for nearly 3,000 exotic orchid species, as 
many as 15,000 species of wild flowers and many species of ornamental 
shrubs, ferns, palms, mammals, birds, reptiles, insects and other 
organisms (Beehler 1992). 
</p>
<p>The production of staple food crops remains the most important 
agricultural activity for 85 per cent of the rural population. Subsistence 
farmers and local communities in Papua New Guinea follow complex 
farming systems. The main crops in the farming system are sweet 
potatoes, taro, yams, cassava, bananas and traditional leafY vegetables. 
</p>
<p>Germplasm collections 
</p>
<p>National ex situ collections of germplasm are held for major food crop 
species, fruits and nut tree species and some underutilised food crop 
species and ornamental plants-the latter being maintained in the 
National Botanical Gardens. Well over 7,000 accessions of 42 crop plant 
species were initially collected and are maintained in ex situ field 
collections. A recent report (Kambuou 1995) on field collections 
reported that 1,474 accessions of 41 plant species are being maintained. 
</p>
<p>126 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Plant genetic resources of Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rest of the collected germplasm has been lost because of 
funding constraints. 
</p>
<p>Bioprospecting 
Advances in technology have enabled quick and inexpensive screening of 
wild products for potential agricultural, pharmaceutical and industrial 
development. Indigenous knowledge of bush medicine can lead 
researchers to discover potentially useful and naturally occurring 
medicinal compounds, and Papua New Guinea's isolated and culturally 
highly variable communities could provide valuable genetic information 
for the field of medicine. It is no surprise, therefore, that scientific and 
industrial demand for access to Papua New Guinea's genetic resources is 
increasing. Given the current trend, the value of Papua New Guinea's 
genetic resources for medicinal and industrial applications is likely to 
increase in the future. The time is now ripe for Papua New Guinea and 
the other island countries in the South Pacific region to take stock of 
these invaluable resources and start formulating policies to govern 
sustainable biodiversity prospecting. 
</p>
<p>Export of germplasm from Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>The germplasm of the 'noble cane' (Saccharum officinarum) of New 
Guinea is a good example of a valuable germplasm that was taken out of 
its centre of origin to help develop the sugarcane industry elsewhere. 
The earliest expedition to collect sugarcane was undertaken in 1875. 
Since then several collecting trips have occurred. Some of these genetic 
materials are now held in the world collections run by the United States 
Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service (USDAlARS), 
while the fate of others, in particular those collected during earlier 
expeditions, are unknown. 
</p>
<p>Other crop resources that have been collected and taken out of the 
country include bananas (Musa spp.), various roots and tuber crops 
(Ipomoea batatas, Dioscorea spp., Colocasia esculenta), aibika (Abelmoschus 
manihot) and coconut (Cocos nuciflra). Apart from the conservation and 
safe keeping of this germplasm in the regional or international 
genebanks, the level of utilisation remains unknown. 
</p>
<p>The National Botanical Gardens has encountered the illegal 
exportation of orchids in the past, and this will pose a major problem in 
the future if the law is not enforced. Some unconfirmed reports suggest 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>that numerous orchids have been illegally exported on timber ships, To 
avoid the illegal exportation of such genetic resources, existing laws need 
to be strengthened, Long-term planning is needed to develop national 
policies on intellectual property rights and other rights, including those 
provided for in the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic 
Resources and the Convention on Biological Diversity, 
</p>
<p>National laws and policies for protection of plant 
genetic resources 
Intellectual property law systems operating in many countries have 
conventionally provided five different types of intellectual property 
rights that might be used to protect plant genetic resources-patents, 
plant breeder rights, trademarks, copyright and trade secrets, The two 
mechanisms most suited to plant genetic resources are patents and plant 
breeder rights. More recently, there has been international debate about 
the development of a new form of protection for plant genetic resources, 
farmers' rights. 
</p>
<p>The Papua New Guinea legal system does not presently provide for 
any of these forms of protection, nor is there any national policy on 
intellectual property rights for plant genetic resources. However, there 
are other laws that relate to the protection of plants and animals, and 
general government policy on sustainable agricultural development and 
the preservation of natural resources and the environment, including the 
regulation of the export of native flora and fauna. 
</p>
<p>Policy on agricultural resources 
</p>
<p>Government policy on the development of agriculture reflects the 
following objectives 
&bull; facilitating the assessment of the environmental and social impact of 
</p>
<p>agricultural development projects 
&bull; promoting sustainable and environmentally sound agricultural 
</p>
<p>practices 
&bull; conservation, assessment and the effective use of genetic diversity of 
</p>
<p>plant and animal species to help maintain and improve the 
agricultural environment 
</p>
<p>&bull; research on the development of methods, including biological control 
methods, that will reduce the impact of agricultural pests, diseases 
and weeds 
</p>
<p>128 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Plant genetic resources of Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>&bull; development of an institutional capacity to undertake regulation, 
monitoring and testing of agrochemicals and agricultural outputs 
</p>
<p>&bull; maximum involvement of local people in all aspects of agricultural 
development and implementation of agricultural projects. 
</p>
<p>Protection of indigenous flora 
</p>
<p>There are several laws that provide protection for the flora of Papua New 
Guinea and prohibit the export of these resources. These include 
&bull; Fauna (Protection and Control) Act 
&bull; International Trade (Fauna and Flora) Act 
&bull; National Parks Act 
&bull; Forestry Act 
&bull; Quarantine Act 
&bull; Customs (Prohibited Export) and (Prohibited Import) Regulations. 
</p>
<p>The Department of Environment and Conservation and the National 
Agriculture Quarantine and Inspection Authority are responsible for 
enforcing these laws through licensing systems that require wildlife 
export permits, Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species certificates and phytosanitary certificates for the export of plant 
material. These systems are intended to protect plant genetic resources 
for a variety of policy reasons. For example, Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species certificates are required as part of an 
international legal framework that protects endangered species 
threatened by international trade. 
</p>
<p>Although this legal framework is in place, the enforcement of these 
Acts and regulations is unsatisfactorily or ineffectively monitored. This 
has resulted in many valuable genetic materials leaving Papua New 
Guinea without proper permit procedures being followed. 
</p>
<p>International undertakings and agreements 
</p>
<p>Convention on Biological Diversity 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant international instrument in terms of plant 
genetic resources is the Convention on Biological Diversity. A total of 
157 nations (including Papua New Guinea) have signed the Convention 
and 65 countries ratified it at that time. The Convention on Biological 
Diversity is a framework agreement which is legally binding and came 
into force on 29 December 1993, having been signed by Papua New 
Guinea in 1992. It provides an international legal justification and a 
</p>
<p>129 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>framework for the country to establish sovereign rights over its genetic 
resources. 
</p>
<p>The objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversiry are the 
conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its 
components. It promotes fair and equitable sharing of the benefits 
arising from the utilisation of genetic resources, including appropriate 
access to genetic resources, and the appropriate transfer of relevant 
technologies, taking into account all rights over those resources and 
technologies (Article 1). Article 1 effectively authorises nations to 
establish regimes to regulate access to their genetic resources. 
</p>
<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity also deals with the rights of 
indigenous communities. It directs parties to 'respect, preserve, and 
maintain knowledge, innovations, and practices of indigenous and local 
communities, embodying traditional lifesryles that are relevant for the 
conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity' (Article 8). 
</p>
<p>The most significant achievement of the Convention on Biological 
Diversity is the establishment of the concept of national sovereignty over 
resources. The concept of states' sovereign rights over natural resources 
has replaced the common heritage principle, and access to a country's 
genetic resources must be on mutually agreed terms and with the prior 
informed consent of the state owning the resources. Prior informed 
consent is an important aspect of any access agreement and any country 
declining to require prior informed consent risks uncontrolled and free 
access to its resources. However, the sovereign rights concept does not 
apply to the resources that are already in the international repositories, 
only to those materials located within a country's borders at the time 
the Convention came into force. 
</p>
<p>International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources 
</p>
<p>The purpose of the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources 
is to ensure that germplasm of economic or social interest, particularly for 
agriculture, will be explored, preserved, evaluated and made available for 
plant breeding and scientific research purposes. The principle aim of this 
undertaking is to redefine the common heritage of mankind and plant 
genetic resources, including those created by modern techniques. 
</p>
<p>A number of amendments have been made to the Undertaking since 
1983. In 1989, Resolution 5/89 was adopted. It redefined the concept 
of farmers' rights as rights arising from the past, present and future 
contributions of farmers in conserving, improving and making available 
</p>
<p>130 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Plant genetic resources of Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>plant genetic resources, particularly those in the centres of origin of 
diversity. The Undertaking also recognises the sovereign rights of 
countries over their plant genetic resources. The Undertaking gives the 
Commission on Plant Genetic Resources of the Food and Agriculture 
Organisation responsibility for monitoring developments with respect to 
intellectual property rights legislation, and assessing their implications 
for the Undertaking. 
</p>
<p>Code of Conduct for Plant Germplasm Collection and 
</p>
<p>Transfer 
</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct for Plant Germplasm Collection and Transfer 
provides a practical approach to recognition of the sovereign rights of 
individual countries over the plant genetic resources in their territories. 
Based on this principle, conservation and continued availability of plant 
genetic resources is a common concern of mankind. In executing these 
rights, access to plant genetic resources should not be unduly restricted. 
The Code further contemplates the right of the permit issuing authority 
to grant or refuse a permit, and that collectors and sponsors should take 
into account the relevant national laws. 
</p>
<p>Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
</p>
<p>Agreement 
</p>
<p>The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement is 
the most comprehensive international instrument on intellectual 
property ever negotiated and adopted. Under this Agreement, signatory 
countries are required to enact a variety of laws relating to intellectual 
property rights. These include laws protecting plant varieties, either by 
patents or by an effective sui generis system (such as plant breeder 
rights) . 
</p>
<p>The Agreement increases protection and incentives for breeders and 
the biotechnology industry. Products or processes must be capable of 
industrial application before they can be eligible for patent protection. 
It can be argued that the Agreement supports and protects those 
activities that are multinational and trade-related in nature. Countries 
that are members of the International Union for the Protection of New 
Varieties of Plants comply with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights Agreement requirement of an effective sui generis system, 
and with advancement in technology, other countries will join and 
</p>
<p>131 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>adopt the legislation of the International Union for the Protection of 
New Varieties of Plants. 
</p>
<p>The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement 
can also be said to be in conflict with the Convention on Biological 
Diversity because it effectively provides incentives for those promoting 
uniformity in plant varieties, as opposed to incentives for in situ 
conservation of a diversity of genetic resources. 
</p>
<p>Countries that are bound by the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights Agreement may decide to protect plant varieties either 
by means of patents or by a sui generis system. The possibility exists for 
combining both the patents and plant breeder right protection systems. 
The protection of plant varieties on the basis of patents may have 
important implications for access to genetic materials for the 
development of new materials and the on-farm use of seeds. For this 
reason, it is likely that many developing countries may consider the use 
of a sui generis system based on the concept of plant breeder rights. 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights and local communities 
None of the international undertakings or agreements described above 
gives effective rights to local communities that are the rightful 
custodians of the rich genetic resources diversity in developing countries. 
It is important that these international agreements and undertakings 
recognise, realise and respect the rights of local communities who are the 
producers, innovators and custodians of the majority of genetic diversity. 
At present, these undertakings are narrow in scope, and effectively only 
recognise innovation and production when it takes place under the 
control of transnational corporations, and in conformity with the 
individualised context of the Western legal system. 
</p>
<p>Under the Convention on Biological Diversity, the rights of 
biodiversity are the sovereign rights of the nation states (Article 3). 
These rights can only exist if they are built on the rights of communities 
that have conserved and protected biodiversity within national territories 
for many decades. The people of Papua New Guinea lead a communal 
life in close relationship with nature and the environment that 
surrounds them. It is of utmost importance that the government stands 
behind the people in protecting biodiversity, especially the rich diversity 
in plant genetic resources. 
</p>
<p>132 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Plant genetic resources of Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Definitions of knowledge and creativity 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights are intended to provide recognition and 
reward for intellectual creativity or to secure ownership over products of 
the human mind. However, knowledge and creativity have been so 
narrowly defined in the context of intellectual property rights that the 
creativity of nature and traditional knowledge systems have been ignored. 
</p>
<p>The intellectual property rights system that is being advocated under 
the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement 
contains little scope for recognising innovation by millions of farmers 
and communities in developing countries, where biological diversity is 
concentrated and from where most knowledge of use has evolved. The 
governments of developing countries are being pressured to adopt 
immediately an intellectual property right system for plant genetic 
resources that serves only the narrow interests of commercial plant 
breeders in industrial countries. In developing new sui generis systems, 
developing country governments should focus on the rights of the 
farmers and local communities who have been the original innovators in 
the utilisation of plant genetic diversity. 
</p>
<p>Limitations of patents and plant breeder rights 
</p>
<p>Patents are the strongest form of intellectual property right protection. 
They give the inventor of a product or process exclusive monopoly rights 
over its commercialisation. The product or process must be new, useful 
and an improvement from the original art to qualifY for a patent. When 
applied to plant genetic resources (as is the case in some countries) 
patent law does not allow farmers to reuse the seeds that they have 
obtained, and does not allow protected varieties to be used for further 
breeding, unless it is for research purposes with no commercial interest. 
The patent system varies from one country to another, because it is 
determined by each country's national legislation. These laws should be 
made flexible to cater for the needs of resource-poor farmers and farming 
communities in developing countries, who may not have the purchasing 
powers to pay for the seeds. 
</p>
<p>Plant breeder rights protect varieties which are new, distinct, uniform 
and stable. Breeder rights exclude non-authorised persons from using 
and multiplying propagating materials of protected varieties, but 
</p>
<p>133 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>generally allow farmers to reuse, for the purpose of planting further crops, 
the seeds that they have obtained. Breeder rights, under a breeders' 
exemption, allow protected varieties to be used for further breeding, 
without the authorisation of the inventor of the variety. This is seen as an 
advantage in the field of plant improvement, as it is possible to freely 
exchange valuable germplasm. 
</p>
<p>The contributions made by the farmers and local communities in 
Papua New Guinea and in other developing countries in the 
conservation, selection and regeneration of plant genetic resources have 
been substantial, and it has been widely agreed that there should be 
some form of recognition for their invaluable efforts. 
</p>
<p>Farmers' rights 
</p>
<p>The concept of farmers' rights was originally proposed in 1983 as an 
amendment to the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic 
Resources of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. It is intended to 
provide a measure of counterbalance to formal intellectual property 
rights by providing a system of intellectual property rights tailored to 
the needs of farmers who have, over many generations, bred food crop 
varieties for their own use. Farmers' rights are based on the recognition 
of the intellectual creativity and innovative capacity of farmers. They are 
not assigned to specific varieties, types of plants or farmers. Rather, their 
purpose is to encourage farmers and farming communities to nurture, 
conserve, utilise and improve plant genetic resources (Food and 
Agriculture Organisation 1993). In the development of a new sui generis 
system for Papua New Guinea, focus should be placed on the rights of 
farmers and local communities. 
</p>
<p>Conclusion 
The purpose of the discussions in this volume is to provide an 
informative basis for the citizens of Papua New Guinea to discuss how to 
respond to issues about use of, and access to, genetic resources. The 
Convention on Biological Diversity has effectively challenged nations to 
think creatively about national sovereignty, conservation and the 
sustainable use of plant genetic resources; about fair and equitable 
sharing of the benefits arising from the use of these resources; and about

<p>Hopefully the suggestions and ideas set out here will continue to 
stimulate discussion at higher government levels. Most importantly, this 
discussion should lead to action, in particular to develop relevant and 
appropriate legislation on intellectual property rights to protect the 
interests, knowledge and techniques of the farmers and local 
communities who have helped to give us access to the wealth of 
biodiversity we enjoy today.

<p>Papua New Guinea has for many years been a site and focus of many 
social and scientific research activities carried out by academic and 
research institutions both from within its borders and from overseas. The 
country has been a target for these activities because of its diverse 
assembly of language, people and environment. It is generally 
acknowledged that the population of Papua New Guinea is the most 
culturally diverse in the world and that it has a highly diverse biological 
environment. Such diversity and the interaction of people with the 
natural environment in an island country for many thousands of years has 
provided a rich resource base for genetic, biochemical and medicinal 
research discoveries. 
</p>
<p>In the last 10-15 years there has been an unprecedented interest in 
bioprospecting in Papua New Guinea, as there has been in other developing 
countries. Prospectors look for human, animal, plant and soil-derived 
genetic and biochemical material that may be of commercial value. The 
scrutiny of biological diversity, guided by traditional knowledge regarding 
diseases and treatments, has led to useful ethnobotanical information that 
may be important in discovering bioactive compounds for pharmaceutical 
and agricultural purposes. 
</p>
<p>Screening tests on plant material derived from traditional knowledge 
tend to yield a higher percentage of positive results compared with 
screening on the basis of random collections (Cox and Balick 1994). 
Traditional medicinal knowledge has therefore made easier the

</p>
<p>identification of useful compounds. Papua New Guinea has now become a 
target of drug research by many institutions from developed countries. 
</p>
<p>Genetic and biochemical resources 
Many research studies in Papua New Guinea have revealed biological 
characteristics unique to its people, and have therefore provided useful 
information about their behaviour and survival, as well as the biochemical 
characteristics and profiles of diseases. Studies have also shown the 
occurrence of certain diseases or strains of viruses and parasites amongst 
population groups which illustrate geographical pooling or clustering. This 
provides evidence of inherent mutations and of the process of coevolution 
(Katz and Skalka 1990; Doolittle et al. 1989). 
</p>
<p>Pioneering research carried out by Carlton Gajdusek and coworkers from 
the 1950s to the 1970s on the Fore people of the Eastern Highlands led to 
the discovery of a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease, commonly 
known as kuru (Zigas and Gajdusek 1957; Alpers and Gajdusek 1965). 
Gajdusek later received a Nobel Prize for this work. More recently a 
discovery was made of a variant human T-celllymphoma/leukemia virus 
type I (HTLV-I) among the Hagahai people (Yanagihara et al. 1990; 
Yanagihara et al. 1991). This finding resulted in the patenting by United 
States scientists of a human cell line derived from the blood of a Hagahai 
man. Discoveries like these, made from human blood, support and 
complement the functions of the Human Genomic Diversity Project. The 
project is aimed at collecting blood, especially from isolated and less known 
populations, in an attempt to discover gene sequences that may be useful in 
gene therapy. Geographical and ethnic confinement of critical data have 
therefore been a strong base for scientific reasoning and explanation for 
disease patterns, transmission and variation (or evolution). In the area of 
malaria research there are current efforts to trial antigens, some presumably 
derived from Papua New Guinea sources, as possible vaccine candidates for 
the disease. 
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that medical discoveries originating from Papua New 
Guinea have led to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of disease 
and consequently the development of appropriate strategies for the control 
and treatment of specific and related diseases. Unfortunately, many such 
discoveries and their potential applications-which have been conveyed in 
scientific journals and international meetings-have been credited almost 
entirely to the scientists involved and their grant donors, without any credit 
to the source of the original material.

</p>
<p>Traditional knowledge as a medical resource 
</p>
<p>Traditional knowledge regarding diseases and their treatment has been part 
of the evolving cultures of many communities in Papua New Guinea. This 
knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Societies in Papua New 
Guinea are rich in knowledge about the use of plant and animal material 
for treating illnesses (Holdsworth 1977). 
</p>
<p>Surveys of medical practices and traditional uses of plants over the last 
100 years have documented some of this knowledge (Hill 1985). However, 
traditional understanding regarding the aetiology of diseases, their diagnosis 
and treatment is generally viewed by Western medicine as having no 
scientific basis. Scientific-based principles regarding proper diagnosis of 
diseases and knowledge about the efficacy and toxicity of plant drugs is 
lacking. Despite that, there has been much anecdotal support for traditional 
therapies using plant preparations. Indeed, many clinically useful drugs 
such as vincristine (anti-tumor), morphine (analgesic), codeine (anti-
tussive/analgesis), quinine and artemisinin (anti-malaria) are derived from 
medicinal plants. But, even with such a contribution, medicinal plant 
preparations must still be subjected to rigorous scientific testing to ascertain 
their safety and make known the active components (Wesche 1987). 
</p>
<p>Natural products and drug discovery: an example 
Interest in natural product screening and development has been expressed 
and planned by local individuals and institutions such as the University of 
Papua New Guinea and the Papua New Guinea University of Technology 
in collaboration with other organisations. Previous and current practice has 
been to accept or invite international scientists, who invariably have 
connections with major drug companies, to come and take plant and 
marine samples for intensive drug screening. Questions pertaining to credit 
or compensation to the resource owners and owners of the knowledge have 
rarely been addressed. In the event that a major drug discovery is made, 
whether directly or indirectly, from the crude material from Papua New 
Guinea, it is possible that Papua New Guinea would never know about it. 
This may mean that any significance of that discovery to traditional 
knowledge is also lost. 
</p>
<p>A project to develop drug discovery programs using Papua New Guinea 
plants is being prepared jointly by researchers from the University of Papua 
New Guinea, the University of Utah and the United States National Cancer 
Institute. The arrangement includes three months of training for the author 
</p>
<p>138 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Genetic. biochemical and medicinal resources 
</p>
<p>at the United States National Cancer Institute. The training will involve 
techniques using various cancer cell lines, including a non-infectious strain 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
</p>
<p>Another investigator, Dr Todd Capson of the University of Utah, has 
been conducting ethnobotanical surveys on the uses of plants by the people 
in the Lakekamu Basin in the Gulf Province and the Crater Mountain area 
of the Eastern Highland Province. Recording of knowledge is based on 
people's willingness to share and to safeguard valuable information before 
the people who have that information die. Dr Capson's work in these areas 
is being carried out in collaboration with the Foundation of the Peoples of 
the South PacificlPapua New Guinea, Ine. and the Research and 
Conservation Foundation ofPapua New Guinea respectively (Capson 
forthcoming). It is hoped that the University of Technology, the Papua New 
Guinea Institute of Medical Research and other institutions may become 
involved. 
</p>
<p>The project is also intimately concerned with the protection and 
conservation of the natural flora and fauna and the promotion of 
sustainable use with a low or no destructive impact-but with maximum 
benefits for the community. For example, the discovery of a drug would 
mean improvement of health and lifestyle and the protection, preservation 
or cultivation of the plant, not to mention the economic benefits. Research 
efforts will no doubt be coordinated with Papua New Guinea-based 
conservation organisations. 
</p>
<p>Agreement for drug discovery 
</p>
<p>Before any work on the drug discovery project begins, a detailed agreement 
between the resource owners and the participating institutions in Papua 
New Guinea and the United States will have to be developed and signed. It 
is proposed to involve Conservation International, a major international 
non-government organisation, in the preparation of the agreement. 
</p>
<p>The basis of the agreement is to give equitable recognition or 
compensation to the people for the knowledge and resources they own (as 
original owners), and to realise their role in the development of a natural 
product. Contractual arrangements will include 
&bull; authorisation for access and collection of materials 
&bull; transfer agreements between institutions 
&bull; sharing of royalties and rights to ownership of discoveries. 
Long-term benefits for the country include the development of scientific 
infrastructure and human resources. Research and development will be an

</p>
<p>integral part of the project. The agreement will no doubt maintain some 
degree of flexibility to enable those involved to explore carefully the extent 
of traditional ownership and transparency in the project. 
</p>
<p>How much can we own, protect and receive credit 
for? 
Issues of ownership and access to genetic material in developing countries 
have generated much discussion in recent years and played an important 
part in the discussions that led to the signing of the Convention on 
Biological Diversity in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The Convention recognises 
the ownership of biodiversity by sovereign countries and calls for equitable 
economic sharing arrangements between resource owners and users. 
However, it fails to make clear a provision for human genetic resources. 
</p>
<p>Underpinning the issue of ownership is the inherent value of the 
material, commodity or knowledge to the people concerned. In traditional 
Papua New Guinea societies, a value cannot be determined absolutely. 
Instead, values are relative and equal to exercising one's right and privileges 
to something before someone else. Relationships in this context are 
fundamental components. The value of the object per se is not necessarily 
the critical issue of contention. Equally important could be simply 
respecting the perspective that 'it is not an issue of money; it's one of 
respect for our ideas in creating knowledge that will help people'-as was 
recently argued by a leading scientist who was left out in a patent (Nowak 
1995:899). 
</p>
<p>Ironically, it may take an outsider to recognise the relevance and value of 
plant or human genetic material and knowledge (for example, 
ethnobotanical information) to the wider community. Value in this case 
may assume a different contextual meaning. In general, value or relevance 
to other people is perceived easily, but value for commercial purposes 
inserts a new dimension into what may not have been the original 
purpose-although the use-purpose is generally acknowledged. This new 
purpose or perspective brings in the concept of added value. If this can be 
equated to value added to a commodity, then a tax-royalty compensation 
can be considered, similar to the concept of value added tax. This tax-
royalty compensation would be relative and depend on the added value of 
the new or modified product. 
</p>
<p>Ownership and value in traditional communities mean status and 
respect, as, for example, in being a leader. Such a position in the 
community can be compromised if valuable knowledge is disseminated or 
</p>
<p>140 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Genetic. biochemical and medicinal resources 
</p>
<p>lost to other people. Protection of possessions, whether they are materials or 
knowledge regarding an art or skill, must therefore be guarded jealously. 
But, as with other systems, circumstances can change. Given the variability 
that exists amongst villages, the rules regarding ownership can be stretched. 
Such dynamism in the traditional realm also assumes that the principles 
governing ownership in communities or villages in Papua New Guinea are 
similar but with boundaries that vary greatly. For example, flexibility in 
allowing cultural material or information to be shared may differ amongst 
groups. 
</p>
<p>These observations provide some guiding principles (though are not 
exhaustive, by any means). On the basis of these, it is possible to observe 
that the answer to the question of how much can we own, protect and 
receive credit for must reflect the following important considerations 
&bull; ownership of the original material and knowledge 
&bull; value attached to helping other people 
&bull; commercial value 
&bull; value added by modification and development. 
</p>
<p>'Original material and knowledge' acknowledges the fact that there is a 
source or proprietor, and value attached to an idea or thing. This implies 
ownership and an already existing relationship between the owner and the 
material or the knowledge. Such a relationship may be typically equated to 
an inherent value, which at the village level (that is, the level of original use) 
is absolute or 100 per cent of the value of the material of knowledge. 
</p>
<p>'Helping other people' acknowledges that people other than the original 
owner are sharing and benefiting from the traditionally derived material 
and knowledge. The new users may include those in the same village, 
outside communities or even scientists. This level is generally non-
commercial, and as such is normally based on trust and confidentiality. The 
inherent value is intact only as far as the original use and purpose is 
exercised or implied in full. Full credit is therefore due to the resource 
owners. But in the event of a new use or potential being uncovered, this will 
lead to a new value being introduced, and will therefore reduce the inherent 
value (that which is related to the original use or purpose). In principle the 
inherent value becomes relative to the exercise of the new use. In this 
respect, some acknowledgment or credit to the resource owner would 
generally be appropriate. 
</p>
<p>'Commercial value' acknowledges that there are other values and interests 
attached to an idea or thing. The original use or the new use may become 
commercially valuable. An appropriate determination can therefore be 
</p>
<p>141 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>made based on the principles stated above, In this situation, 
acknowledgment or credit should follow the manner of the interest being 
expressed along commercial lines. The inherent value, if it can be 
determined, may assume the character of a tax-royalty compensation where 
it is dependent on the new value being added. 
</p>
<p>'Modification and development' acknowledges the input of others to 
derive something new-with a new value attached. This level is generally 
the same as commercial value but recognises the novelty of the material or 
product being developed from what was derived from the resource owners. 
The original source of the material is generally not recognisable or visible. 
</p>
<p>Novelty can shift much of the credit or benefits to the discoverer with 
little or nothing going to the resource owners. For this reason, the issue of 
inherent value can be difficult to determine other than in the context of 
being the source of the new product. In addition, the novel product may 
also assume its own inherent value which may decrease the value that 
should go to the resource owners. 
</p>
<p>Despite this difficulty, the value accorded to the resource owners can be 
made more tangible by involving the resource owners as partners in the 
development of novel products using their resources. Although their 
involvement may not be visible in the laboratory, there can be clear 
transparency as to their involvement up to the final stage of product 
development. In this way, resource owners can continue to exercise some 
ownership over the products that are being developed from their traditional 
base. 
</p>
<p>A careful analysis and consideration of these issues can ensure that people 
receive a fair share of what was originally derived from them. One should 
keep the big picture in mind. Under the model proposed here, resource 
owners would be partners with scientists (and other interest groups) in 
developing plant-derived medicines for commercial and health use to 
benefit them and all humankind. The greater involvement of people in such 
enterprises can only maximise what they can own, protect and receive credit 
for.

Access to genetic resources 
</p>
<p>legal and policy issues 
</p>
<p>Kathy Whimpl 
</p>
<p>Much of the world's biodiversity is located in developing countries. 
Many of the food crops we rely on today were originally sourced from 
countries which are now developing or emerging industrial economies. 
Germplasm of many kinds has been exchanged for many years for a 
variety of reasons, mostly associated with agriculture. 
</p>
<p>During the last 20 years, there have been dramatic changes in the 
significance of genetic material in economic and social terms. New 
technologies mean that some kinds of genetic material are now valuable 
resources for the development of yet other technologies, processes and 
products. As commercial interest in genetic material has grown, there 
has been increased pressure for intellectual property right protection to 
be available to protect those commercial investments. At the same time, 
developing countries have expressed concern about their genetic heritage 
being exploited with little or no recompense. 
</p>
<p>These changes have generated a dynamic and complex environment. 
There are many developments at national and international levels. Most 
are at the cutting edge of law and government administration. Many 
countries are uncertain about how to proceed, while at the same time 
feeling impelled to act quickly. This chapter examines the background to 
the emergence of this important international policy debate. It canvasses 
the possible approaches to securing better protection for national 
biodiversity resources, including intellectual property rights and access 
regimes. The chapter concludes that while intellectual property rights on

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>their own have limited value there are many problems in using existing 
intellectual property law, particularly where resources are owned by 
indigenous landowners rather than the state. Countries like Papua New 
Guinea are likely to gain greater flexibility and broader protection from 
legal regimes that regulate access to genetic resources and prescribe the 
terms on which they can be used, including the diposition of any 
intellectual property rights. 
</p>
<p>Background: ownership of genetic resources 
In a Western cultural context, products of nature were for a long time 
regarded as the common heritage of humankind (Margulies 1992). In a 
legal sense, the ownership of genetic information in plants and animals 
has generally not been distinguished from ownership of the physical 
biota themselves. 
</p>
<p>Over the last 50 years, concern has mounted that this heritage 
might be lost as the pool of genetic stock from which commercial 
agricultural crops come has shrunk. In response to concerns about the 
future food security of the world, a variety of plant genetic material 
was collected into a number of gene banks around the world. Although 
independent, they are managed through an international network 
linked by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural 
Research. The majority of this material is held outside the countries 
where it was originally collected, and the origins of much of it can no 
longer be determined. 
</p>
<p>International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources 
</p>
<p>In the 1970s, developing countries began to express concern that they 
might lose access to the genetic material held outside their territorial 
control. In 1983, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation oversaw 
the development of an International Undertaking on Plant Genetic 
Resources, which forms the basis for a global system of access to 
genetic resources for food and agriculture. Between 1989 and 1994, 
the Food and Agriculture Organisation negotiated with the 
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research to place its 
genebank collections under the control of the Food and Agriculture 
Organisation network, and to agree that they should not seek 
intellectual property rights in relation to any of the material held 
there. 
</p>
<p>144 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Access to genetic resources 
</p>
<p>In 1991 the Undertaking was renegotiated to provide for recognition 
of individual states' national sovereignty in the biological resources 
originating within their territory (Margulies 1992). However, the 
Undertaking was, and is, a non-binding document. It was renegotiated 
again during April 1999, and a major issue for consideration was its 
adoption as a legally binding international instrument. 
</p>
<p>Convention on Biological Diversity 
</p>
<p>The Convention on Biological Diversity entered into force in December 
1993. It is the first international instrument to recognise the national 
sovereignty of individual states over genetic resources. It specifically 
addresses the issue of access, and requires that countries take steps to 
facilitate access by other countries to their genetic resources (Article 15). 
It also requires that 
&bull; access be subject to prior informed consent by the providing country 
</p>
<p>(Article 15.5)2 
&bull; the terms of access should be mutually agreed (Article 15.4) 
&bull; states should protect indigenous and local knowledge and ensure that 
</p>
<p>these communities share equitably in the benefits of utilising their 
knowledge (Article 8 (j)) 
</p>
<p>&bull; states should make technology for the conservation of biodiversity 
available to other countries on mutually agreed terms, subject to 
intellectual property rights (Article 16). 
</p>
<p>The significance of intellectual property 
Concerns about the disposition of genetic material do not relate to the 
physical substance of the biological material. Rather, the concern is that 
others may use the genetic information, or the molecular structure of 
chemicals within the material, and benefit from the use of that 
information. Intellectual property rights are the principal way in which 
rights to control the use of incorporeal property (that is, property that 
does not have a physical form) are recognised. 
</p>
<p>Information or ideas can be protected in several different ways within the 
framework of most Western (Euro-American)-based legal systems (see 
Harroun, this volume). The type of intellectual property right most relevant 
to a discussion of genetic material is patents, which protects inventions and 
processes. A patent allows the owner to prevent any other person making the 
same invention, or using the same process, without his or her permission. 
</p>
<p>145 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Patents 
Commercially valuable ideas only remain valuable while they give the 
owner of the idea an advantage over her or his competitors. The owner of 
an idea can maintain this advantage in two ways-either the idea must 
be kept a trade secret (like the formula for Coca-Cola) or there must be a 
way to prevent a public idea being used by everyone. Patents provide a 
legal means of restricting ideas that the inventor has placed in the public 
domain. 
</p>
<p>Patents reward individuals for investing their creative effort in 
developing an idea. In return for protection, the individual must make 
the idea public through a registration system. This means that other 
inventors have access to the idea and can use it to develop further 
technology. A central policy goal of patent systems is to encourage and 
facilitate scientific and technological discovery. 
</p>
<p>The protection offered by patents can be described as a 'temporary 
exclusive economic monopoly right' (Lesser n.d.). The owner of such a 
monopoly right can stop all others from using his or her invention. In 
this way, the commercial value of the invention is maximised because its 
use is limited. However, this special monopoly continues for only a 
limited period. In most countries, patents last for around 20 years, after 
which the invention is freely available to be manufactured or used by 
anyone. 
</p>
<p>A major reason for the effectiveness of patent protection is the 
reciprocal recognition that is available in other countries. Under the 
Paris Convention of 1883, member countries undertake to protect the 
citizens of other countries in the same way as they treat their own. This 
protection was expanded in 1970 by the adoption of the Patent Co-
operation Treaty, which establishes a system for making one single 
application for a patent that has effect in all member countries. 
</p>
<p>The operation of the international patent system is further enhanced 
by the adoption of common approaches by the majority of industrial 
countries. Under the Strasbourg Agreement of 1971, a uniform system 
of classification has been adopted. Difficulties in describing 
microorganisms for the purpose of a patent application are covered by a 
system of 'approved depository authorities' established under the 
Budapest Convention of 1977 (Whimp 1997b). 
</p>
<p>146 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Access to genetic resources 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights and genetic resources 
Traditionally, products of nature could not be the subject of patent 
protection. This rule was established in a 1908 United States case in 
which a patent application for an object made from cork was refused 
(Bozecevic 1987). In order to be granted a patent, an invention must 
satisfY the criteria of novelty, non-obviousness and usefulness. Non-
obviousness means that the invention must demonstrate that some skill 
or art was involved in the invention. Products of nature usually fail to 
satisfY both the novelty and non-obviousness criteria. 
</p>
<p>Plant variety rights 
</p>
<p>In the 1930s, the United States government enacted a law offering 
protection for plant varieties, in order to promote the development of a 
plant breeding industry. Plant breeder rights, or plant variety rights, are 
a system of sui generis (one of a kind) protection for varieties of plants 
that have been artificially propagated. Protection offered by this type of 
intellectual property right is similar to patent protection-the breeder is 
granted a legal right to control other's reproduction of the plant, in 
return for disclosing the method by which the new variety was derived. 
</p>
<p>By 1961, there was sufficient interest to establish an international 
convention dealing with plant variety rights. The International 
Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants was adopted in 
1961 and significantly revised in 1978. Almost all the members are 
developed countries. Several other countries have plant breeder rights 
legislation, but do not belong to the International Convention for the 
Protection of New Varieties of Plants. 
</p>
<p>The restrictions applied to plant variety rights under the Internat-
ional Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants have 
meant that it was not of much use to developing countries. In practice it 
has a fairly limited application to ornamental and some agricultural 
plants. In 1991, the Convention was updated to make it even more 
restrictive from a developing country point of view. The provisions of the 
Convention also now prevent farmers from using saved seed from 
protected varieties. The requirement to demonstrate that a variety is 
'distinct, uniform and stable' means that few indigenous farmers would 
be able to satisfY the criteria for protection (Crucible Group 1994).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Biotechnology 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important change affecting intellectual property rights 
as they relate to plants was the emergence of new biotechnology 
techniques during the 1970s (Lesser n.d.). In particular, the availability 
of recombinant DNA and hybridoma techniques made it possible to 
artificially develop organic materials and substances that were quite 
distinct from their biological components, and therefore able to be 
patented (Power 1992). 
</p>
<p>At least in the United States, intellectual property law kept pace with 
technological developments. In 1980, the US Supreme Court in the 
decision of Diamond v Chakrabart/ upheld a decision of the Patent 
Office to award a patent to an artificially modified microorganism. 
Applications for patent protection in the United States now embrace a 
wide range of biologically derived materials and processes, including 
pharmaceuticals, antibodies, vaccines, enzymes, cell lines, first 
generation plant hybrids, processes for synthesising these materials, 
diagnostic processes and kits, and treatment processes (Power 1992). 
</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world, patent laws are often much more restrictive. 
A number of countries, principally developing and newly industrialised, 
do not permit the patenting of a wide range of biologically derived 
products including pharmaceuticals. These restrictions usually have a 
moral basis, and emerge from ideas that life forms should not be the 
subject of private property rights, or that pharmaceuticals should be 
freely available (Gollin 1993:169; Simpson 1997:72-3). 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property in the international context 
</p>
<p>Convention on Biological Diversity 
</p>
<p>During the debate that preceded the adoption of the Convention on 
Biological Diversity, a major dispute erupted within the international 
community about provisions relating to the transfer of technology from 
industrial to developing countries. While developing countries wanted 
industrial nations to make technology for the conservation of biodiversity 
available to them on a preferential basis, the representatives of industrial 
countries objected that their citizens should be entitled to have their 
intellectual property in that technology protected. They argued that the 
owners of technology should be entitled to refuse access in countries 
where such protection would not be available (Margulies 1992:335).

</p>
<p>The compromise provisions appearing in Article 16 of the Convention 
on Biological Diversity make for confusing reading (Goldman 
1994:708). However, it appears clear that developed countries are 
entitled to refuse access to technology if the recipient country is not able 
to offer protection for intellectual property.

<p>World Trade Organisation and the Trade-Related Aspects of 
</p>
<p>International Property Rights Agreement 
</p>
<p>The significance of intellectual property in the international context 
increased further with the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, concluded in 1993. The negotiations resulted in the 
establishment of the World Trade Organisation and the signing of a 
major agreement dealing with intellectual property. 
</p>
<p>Three countries in the Pacific island region (Papua New Guinea, Fiji 
and Solomon Islands) are members of the World Trade Organisation and 
are bound by the provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects of Internation-
al Property Rights Agreement. Under the Agreement, members of the 
World Trade Organisation must adopt intellectual property rights 
legislation covering 
&bull; patents (in the form specified by the Paris Convention) 
&bull; copyright (in the form specified by the Berne Convention) 
&bull; protection of plant varieties (either under patent or under a sui generis 
</p>
<p>system like the International Convention for the Protection of New 
Varieties of Plants) 
</p>
<p>&bull; trademarks, geographic indications and designs, including integrated 
circuit layout designs 
</p>
<p>&bull; trade secrets (as required by the Paris Convention) (Whimp 1997b). 
Developing countries (including Papua New Guinea) that are making 
</p>
<p>a transition to a market-based economy have until 2001 to comply. 
Least developed countries have until 2006 to comply with the terms of 
the Trade-Related Aspects of International Property Rights Agreement 
(Article 65). Even countries with no intellectual property rights laws are 
required to accept patent applications for pharmaceutical and 
agricultural chemical products from the beginning of the transition 
period, so as to preserve the novelty of the invention for the time when 
patent laws are in place.

</p>
<p>interests in unmodified genetic resources and the traditional knowledge 
of indigenous people has been the subject of much debate 
internationally (Simpson 1997:114-29). 
</p>
<p>Access to and use of genetic resources 
A number of developing countries with globally significant biodiversity 
(and at least one developed country, Australia) are currently 
experiencing an increased interest in access to these resources for 
commercial purposes. This interest may provide an opportunity for 
sustainable use activities, transfer of technology and the potential for 
some financial gain. However, it also presents real challenges to ensure 
that these benefits are maximised, and that possible negative 
consequences are avoided. 
</p>
<p>Exchange of genetic material has occurred on an informal basis 
between Pacific island nations for some time. Exchanges have involved 
genetic material of local food, agriculture and tree crops. Because most 
of this exchange has occurred either at a customary level, or between 
government agencies, it has not raised questions about the inappropriate 
exploitation of the material for commercial purposes. However, recent 
experience of unauthorised use of genetic material (including, in one 
case, human genetic material) has caused offence and concern in many 
quarters.4 In addition, there are now fears that the traditional 
ethnobotanical knowledge of indigenous people may also be exploited. 
</p>
<p>The issue of greatest concern in controlling access to genetic resources 
relates to bioprospecting for chemical compounds found in plants that 
might yield useful material for the production of pharmaceuticals. The 
way in which bioprospecting is carried out makes it difficult to control. 
A relatively small amount of vegetative matter is required to produce a 
sample for screening.5 In some cases, screening (for anti-cancer 
compounds, for example) can be carried out within the country. Illicit 
export would be very difficult to detect. The difficulty in policing illegal 
bioprospecting means that attempting to prohibit it is unlikely to be 
successful. In any case, there may be significant benefits to be gained 
through properly negotiated and monitored arrangements. These 
advantages are already being recognised by a number of local research 
institutions that are entering into agreements with developed country 
counterparts, usually acting on behalf of large pharmaceutical firms. 
</p>
<p>Research institutions, however well meaning, may not necessarily be 
in the best position to consider and balance all the national and local 
</p>
<p>150 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Access to genetic resources 
</p>
<p>considerations that should form part of a response to commercial 
bioprospecting proposals. However, in the absence of national policy or 
legislation, they at least provide an institution with whom prospective 
prospectors can negotiate. 
</p>
<p>A particularly important consideration in the case of commercial 
proposals for accessing genetic resources is the control of intellectual 
property rights in something that might be discovered. However, the 
chances of making a successful find are not high-around one in 10,000 
leads produces a drug that proceeds to clinical trials (Reid et al. 
1993b:7) (although one plant species can yield hundreds of leads). 
When a find is successful, the financial returns may not be as high as 
some expect. Royalties for unproven samples (those that have not been 
subject to preliminary testing) reportedly range from 1 to 5 per cent of 
net sales (Laird 1993:11). Net sales in this case would mean profits after 
research and development costs and production and distribution costs 
are deducted. In the case of pharmaceuticals, research and development 
costs are extremely high. In the early 1990s it was estimated that the 
average cost of producing a marketable drug was US$231 million, most 
of which was spent on clinical trials (Reid et al. 1993b: 16). 
</p>
<p>These factors should lead developing countries to be cautious about 
how much they spend establishing and maintaining regulatory systems 
to capture what may be a marginal financial benefit, when compared to 
the cost of administering the system. On the other hand, there are also 
important social opportunities for the protection of indigenous 
knowledge, creation of incentives for conservation and the promotion of 
opportunities for sustainable rural development activities. All these 
considerations must be balanced in developing a locally appropriate 
approach. 
</p>
<p>Regional implications of initiatives to assert sovereignty over genetic 
resources are also an issue. Problems of this kind are illustrated by the 
rosy periwinkle biospiracy described by Goldman (1994:718). 
International pharmaceutical company Lily manufactured an anti-cancer 
agent from the rosy periwinkle. Accounts usually attribute the plant to 
Madagascar, where it was first harvested. In fact, it is cultivated or grows 
wild in most semi-tropical and temperate parts of the world. 
Investigation of the periwinkle began because of folklore in the 
Philippines and Jamaica about its use as a tea in cases of diabetes. The 
plant was subsequently harvested in India and Madagascar for initial 
production of the drug, and eventually put under commercial

</p>
<p>cultivation in Texas. In such circumstances it is not at all clear who 
should benefit from is exploitation. This is not to suggest that the 
developing countries involved were not entitled to compensation, but 
rather to illustrate the difficulties in equitably distributing it. 
</p>
<p>The distribution of species across the Pacific and in Asia means that 
national systems have the potential to disenfranchise neighbouring 
countries, even though that was not intended. There is a potential for 
disputes between countries to arise unless bioregional arrangements are 
in place to resolve them. 
</p>
<p>Possible approaches 
A vigorous and fertile international discussion of these issues and how to 
address them has emerged over the last decade, and has gathered pace in 
the last five years. There are two distinct aspects to bioprospecting that 
involve separate legal issues. First, traditional knowledge about wild 
plants and their medicinal uses should be protected from exploitation. 
Second, the use of genetic resources themselves should be controlled 
through a system that ensures an appropriate level of consent, and an 
equitable distribution of benefits from their use, 
</p>
<p>The need for protection of traditional knowledge has generated a 
number of suggested approaches that focus on recognition of the 
importance and value of this knowledge 
&bull; protection of farmers' rights, partly as a counterbalance to plant 
</p>
<p>breeder rights 
&bull; application of trade secrets to traditional knowledge 
&bull; development of sui generis (one of a kind) intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>systems to protect indigenous rights 
&bull; codes of ethics for researchers dealing with communities. 
</p>
<p>Not many of these approaches have been carried into effect, and so 
there is little available precedent to guide countries in adopting them. 
</p>
<p>The protection of genetic resources has been approached from a 
number of different angles, and the following solutions are in use or 
have been suggested. 
&bull; Codes of conduct for collectors. 
&bull; Development of intellectual property rights for plants (either plant 
</p>
<p>breeder rights or patents). 
&bull; Access regimes, including research or materials transfer agreements, 
</p>
<p>sometimes secured by collectors' licences or permits.

</p>
<p>Merck-Inbio: bioprospecting partnership agreements 
</p>
<p>The Merck-Inbio arrangement is an example of an approach adopted by 
one country which aims to protect indigenous knowledge, to ensure a 
financial return, provide access to technology and training, as well as 
leveraging conservation benefits. Under this arrangement, the Inbio 
institute, on behalf of the government of Costa Rica, entered into a 
detailed and comprehensive partnership agreement with the 
pharmaceutical company Merck, to prospect Costa Rica's rich tropical 
forests (Reid et al. 1993a). 
</p>
<p>The agreement involves a substantial upfront payment, support for 
the establishment of local institutions, transfer of technology and 
equipment and a share of royalties. It should be noted that some 
commentators have criticised the agreement on the basis that the 
upfront payment of US$l.13 million is a small price to pay for access to 
such a large reservoir of biodiversity (Simpson 1997). However, it is 
difficult to know the real value to Costa Rica without knowing the terms 
that have been agreed about royalty sharing, and these are confidential 
(Laird 1993:111). 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea would do well to study the Merck-Inbio 
arrangement, and might consider a partnership with one company 
preferable to managing a number of small contracts. However, it is also 
important to remember that what makes Costa Rica attractive to a 
potential bioprospector is its stable and well developed administrative 
infrastructure, a long history of political commitment and funding for 
environment projects and the availability of highly skilled professional 
staff to undertake the taxonomy involved. 
</p>
<p>The approach adopted in Costa Rica involves a level of state control 
over biodiversity that might not be acceptable to people in Papua New 
Guinea. The Costa Rican government has recently enacted a Biodiversity 
Law (Ley de Biodiversidad) that declares that while animals and plants 
can be privately owned, their genetic and biochemical properties are the 
property of the state (Rivera and Cordero 1999). 
</p>
<p>Protecting traditional knowledge and genetic 
resources with intellectual property rights 
Genetic resources in a natural, unmodified state cannot be the subject of 
patent protection. Traditional knowledge also does not lend itself to 
</p>
<p>153 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>protection under existing patent law systems. Patents create individual 
rights. In a number of countries, the person applying for the patent 
must establish that they are the inventor of the process being described. 
Knowledge about a particular use of a plant that has been handed down 
through generations may be a sufficient basis for patent protection 
(Huft 1995), but a patent application may cost around US$20,000. 
Even if these expensive rights are obtained, they expire after 20 years, 
leaving the information legally in the public domain. 
</p>
<p>Trade secret law is probably a more appropriate form of protection for 
traditional knowledge, because it does not expire unless the secrecy is 
waived (by publication, for example), and requires no formal process of 
proof or registration. However, to maintain protection, the group needs 
to keep the information secret. Information that is secret can be divulg-
ed (for example to a bioprospector) provided there is a contract requiring 
the third party to maintain confidentiality. Any unauthorised use could 
be the subject of a legal action and might invalidate a patent based on it. 
</p>
<p>Ironically, some indigenous communities may be encouraged to give 
away the possibility of trade secret protection in order to protect their 
knowledge being copied by third parties. Although traditional 
indigenous knowledge is rarely of itself the subject of patent 
applications, many indigenous communities have experienced 
researchers publishing accounts of their knowledge and obtaining 
copyright over those publications. The best protection against copyright 
misappropriation is prior publication by the group itself However, the 
voluntary publication of material may also rule out the possibility of 
trade secret protection. 
</p>
<p>Codes of ethics for researchers 
</p>
<p>Some of the infringements of indigenous rights can be addressed 
through more ethical behaviour by researchers. Guidelines of this kind 
are included in the Code of Ethics of the Australian Anthropological Society. 
Such a code might include a requirement for knowledge not to be 
published without the specific permission of those from whom it was 
obtained, and/or requirements for joint copyright to be specified on 
publication. The Manila Declaration, adopted at the seventh Asian 
Symposium on Medicinal Plants, Spices and Other Natural Products, 
contains some ethical guidelines for scientists engaged in ethnobotanical 
collecting. Several others are available. 6

<p>Access to genetic resources 
</p>
<p>Community intellectual property rights 
</p>
<p>A number of commentators have proposed that a special sui generis form 
of intellectual property rights should be created to protect the 
traditional knowledge of indigenous people (Simpson 1997:146). It has 
also been suggested that this alternative system might provide a way for 
developing countries to meet their obligations under the Trade-Related 
Aspects of International Property Rights Agreement (to provide 
protection for plant varieties), while respecting the traditional 
knowledge systems that are fundamental to their culture. In 1994, a 
project by the Third World Network produced a draft Community 
Intellectual Rights Act setting out a very broad framework for 
recognition of community custodianship of innovation and commercial 
use of indigenous knowledge. In 1998, the Organisation for African 
Unity produced a Declaration and Model Law on Community Rights 
and Access to Biological Resources. Both drafts are expressed in 
extremely broad terms and, for example, contain no mechanisms for 
enforcement.7 
</p>
<p>Sui generis systems have two major disadvantages that should be 
considered carefully. First, a system of intellectual property rights is only 
as good as the capacity to enforce it, generally within the country where 
the law was passed. It is highly likely that infringements of indigenous 
intellectual property rights-for example, by the patenting of a chemical 
compound based on traditional knowledge about its use-will occur 
outside the country where the indigenous owners live. In other words, 
unless other countries-in particular developed countries whose citizens 
are most likely to infringe traditional rights-adopt reciprocal or 
complementary systems, the protection offered by sui generis systems 
will be limited to the country in which the law is enacted. 
</p>
<p>Second, proposals for sui generis systems raise problems about the legal 
identification of the group that owns traditional knowledge, and how 
that information is handled in transmission through generations and 
between groups as a result of customary practices. Still more problems 
arise if more than one group possesses the same knowledge. 
</p>
<p>A project is underway in Ecuador to establish a 'cartel' over 
indigenous knowledge. It involves a system of regional depository 
databases, that are kept confidential unless it appears that knowledge is 
registered by more than one group, in which case they may jointly 
negotiate the release of the information (Simpson 1997:80). It appears 
</p>
<p>155 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>that a large and relatively expensive infrastructure is involved in such a 
system. 
</p>
<p>The Ecuador proposal works on the basis of trade secret protection, 
rather than establishing a new system of rights. On balance, trade secret 
protection does seem to be the most useful way to protect indigenous 
knowledge, provided the knowledge is not yet in the public domain and 
its continued secrecy can be maintained by contracts with third parties. 
A law that asserts the rights of indigenous people to be protected by 
trade secrecy, and provides an easy means for them to assert that 
protection, could provide a useful complement to access and contract 
systems described below. 
</p>
<p>Access regimes 
By far the most widely adopted approach to protecting the interests of 
developing countries in genetic resources is through the development of 
access regimes. An access regime is a framework for setting the terms on 
which people may access genetic resources within the country. It is an 
exercise of national sovereignty as envisaged by the Convention on 
Biological Diversity. To be effective, the framework of a legal regime 
controlling access to genetic resources should have three elements 
&bull; a set of rules (whether imposed by law or as a matter of policy) 
&bull; a clear division of responsibility for decision making about access 
</p>
<p>proposals 
&bull; the capacity to implement the rules and make decisions. 
A number of countries have adopted, or are considering, access regimes. 
Most, but not all, are imposed through legislation. They include 
&bull; Philippines Executive Order 247 
&bull; Fiji draft Sustainable Development Bill, clause 254 
&bull; Andean Pact (Cartagena Agreement Commission) Decision 391

<p>amended in 1994 
&bull; Uganda National Environmental Statute 1995 (Glowka 1998). 
</p>
<p>The basis of almost all access regimes is a contract permitting access 
on specified terms and conditions. These agreements are sometimes 
called research agreements, and sometimes materials transfer agreements 
(both might be used for different purposes). They can be secured by a 
law that prohibits access without a permit or licence, or they may be 
imposed simply as a result of government policy. Where foreigners are 
concerned, it is usually possible to impose requirements simply through 
immigration restrictions as a condition of visas, for example. If there is 
concern that citizens within a country are involved in bioprospecting, 
then a separate law will be needed to enforce the requirement for 
contracts prior to accessing genetic resources. 
</p>
<p>Codes of conduct for collection 
</p>
<p>Codes of conduct are a useful way of setting a common framework for an 
activity, particularly where the persons or bodies to be bound by it are 
already in a relationship with one another, and there is a general desire 
to do the right thing. The exchange of germplasm between Pacific island 
country governments has been occurring for some time. Agencies involv-
ed in tree and food crop improvement programs regularly undertake 
such exchanges, with mutually beneficial aims. In recognition of the 
growing sensitivity about these exchanges, a number of programs have 
developed codes of conduct that regulate the process of collection. Most 
of them provide that intellectual properry in the genetic material 
remains with the donor country, and there are restrictions on the transfer 
of material to third parties. 
</p>
<p>157 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Other codes of conduct for collection are also available and might be 
adopted for use. These include the Food and Agriculture Organisation 
Draft International Code of Conduct for Plant Germplasm Collecting 
and Transfer, and the provisions of the Manila Declaration on the 
Ethical Utilisation of Asian Biological Resources, adopted at the seventh 
meeting of the Asian Symposium on Medicinal Plants and Spices. It 
includes suggested minimum standards for contracts between collecting 
organisations and their developing country hosts. A number of codes of 
conduct are available on the Working Group on Traditional Resource 
Rights website.8 Many provide similar comprehensive lists of possible 
conditions for an access regime. 
</p>
<p>Elements of an access regime 
</p>
<p>Scope 
</p>
<p>An access law or policy should specify the scope of coverage of the 
activities that are permitted and that should be undertaken in accordance 
with the scheme. The scope of an access regime will be governed mainly 
by the way key concepts are defined. Genetic resources and biodiversity 
might be defined widely (to include knowledge about genetic resources, 
for example) if there are concerns that prospecting activities may take 
place without samples actually being removed. Reference to the defin-
itions in the Convention on Biological Diversity would be useful. Bio-
prospecting should also be carefully defined, since many activities involve 
the taking of small amounts of vegetative material (harvesting tea, for 
example) that should not be accidentally captured by the scheme. 
</p>
<p>There should be provision to limit the scope of application to 
particular species or habitats, depending on rarity, ecosystem fragility, 
danger of genetic erosion or risk of adverse social impacts. The harvesting 
of human genetic material should be excluded from the scheme. In 
addition, most access regimes exclude customary transfers of material 
from permit requirements. In some cases it may be appropriate to 
extend this to customary transfers between countries. 
</p>
<p>Competent national authority 
</p>
<p>An essential element of an access regime is a national body with whom 
research agreements or materials transfer agreements should be 
negotiated. Multiagency groups (involving representatives from a 
</p>
<p>158 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Access to genetic resources 
</p>
<p>number of interested departments) are a common choice, but these 
sometimes have the disadvantage of being slow to make decisions, and 
they can be too cumbersome in some situations to negotiate adequately. 
Legislation may be needed to give a body of this kind the legal status to 
enter into binding contracts with bioprospectors, or the body may act in 
an advisory capacity to another authority, such as a minister, who 
ultimately signs contracts. 
</p>
<p>In some cases it may be more appropriate to use existing sectoral 
bodies operating within a clear framework and with an independent 
agency (such as the Attorney-General's office) involved in overseeing 
compliance. If existing agencies are used, it may be more appropriate to 
amend their existing legislation than to develop a new Act (if legislation 
is desired). However, the dangers of duplicating licensing requirements 
should be borne in mind. 
</p>
<p>In the absence of national policy or legislation, research organisations 
in Pacific island countries are taking on the role of negotiating the terms 
on which access occurs. While these organisations have considerable 
knowledge about these issues, they cannot assume the role of granting 
consent to access genetic resources on behalf of a nation state, unless 
they have been specifically authorised to do so by legislation. In any 
case, local research institutions may not be the appropriate bodies to act 
as the competent national authority, given that they usually stand to 
gain financially from the proposed bioprospecting projects. 
</p>
<p>Regulatory system 
</p>
<p>Bioprospecting activities will often involve as many as four discrete 
organisations working together: a pharmaceutical company; the overseas 
research institution that it engages to undertake the research work; a 
local partner institution, and sometimes a body representing the 
government and/or local communities. 
</p>
<p>The regulatory system should be effective in controlling the use of 
genetic material after it has left the country, and is in the hands of third 
parties who may not have been directly involved in the collection of the 
material. While permits issued within a country allow the state to 
exercise a gatekeeper role, and provide a basis for challenging collecting 
activities that are not in accordance with it, they do not provide a basis 
for challenging unauthorised use of material once it has left the country. 
Collateral contract arrangements are needed to ensure that there is 
</p>
<p>159 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>control over the use of material after it has been collected and the results 
of tests are passed on to the clients of the research organisation. 
</p>
<p>It may be appropriate for the access regime to provide for framework 
agreements setting out in broad terms the relationship between the 
bioprospector and the host country; for example, partnerships between 
local research or collecting bodies, and overseas companies seeking to 
benefit from the bioprospecting activities. Within the framework of 
these agreements, much simpler individual materials transfer agreements 
could be negotiated. 
</p>
<p>Basis for access 
</p>
<p>The national law or policy should set out the basic minimum terms for 
access but should not be too prescriptive. The process for applying for 
access permission should be transparent, effective and efficient. 
Licensing administrative systems can easily develop a life of their own 
and sometimes create more problems than they solve. Minimum terms 
might include the following. 
</p>
<p>Application processes 
</p>
<p>&bull; Requirement for full disclosure of information about the proposed 
activity (including the locality, the nature of the activity, the species 
to be harvested and sampling techniques to be used) and the end use 
to which the material will be put (in other words, a complete project 
proposal and plan). 
</p>
<p>&bull; Requirement to demonstrate adequate skill and knowledge to carry 
out the work. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Where it is considered viable to develop a local industry, a require-
ment for collaboration with a local research body may be required. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Limits on the duration of exclusive materials transfer agreements. 
</p>
<p>Collection 
</p>
<p>&bull; Requirement to carry out research in an environmentally sound 
manner and comply with environmental laws, and not to deplete 
local populations. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Requirement to observe all other laws of the country in relation to 
collection and export, including quarantine laws. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Requirement to enter into collecting agreements with local and 
indigenous communities.

</p>
<p>&bull; Requirements for deposit of voucher specimens with the national 
herbarium. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Requirement for academic citation in relation to published research 
findings. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Access to research information (this might not realistically be required 
in the case of commercial agreements, but could be required of 
academic agreements). 
</p>
<p>&bull; Circumstances in which information provided to the national 
authority can be kept confidential, and any limit on the duration of

involve different considerations from commercial bioprospecting ones. It 
may be appropriate to have a different set of requirements applying to 
these situations. For example, academic agreements might contain 
&bull; a prohibition on obtaining any intellectual property over the material 
&bull; restrictions on disposal of material and/or information to third parties. 
</p>
<p>Given that there is no direct monetary benefit arising from the 
exchange, it may also be appropriate to limit fees so that only collectors 
fees (paid to local communities) are required. 
</p>
<p>Research agreements/materials transfer agreements 
</p>
<p>Within the framework provided by the access regime, research 
agreements or materials transfer agreements are likely to form the basis 
of the individual arrangements applying to specific collecting proposals. 
Agreements may contain a range of standard provisions including 
&bull; transfer of materials collected into custody of collector 
&bull; limitations on transfer to third parties 
&bull; whether destructive harvesting (for example, involving whole plants 
</p>
<p>and bark) is permitted 
&bull; maximum volume limitations per species or overall, and provisions for 
</p>
<p>extending these 
&bull; limitations on assertion of ownership over materials and genetic

</p>
<p>Access regimes are a means by which nations can ensure that access to 
the genetic resources within their sovereign territory occurs only with 
their prior informed consent and on mutually agreed terms, as required 
by the Convention on Biological Diversity. 
</p>
<p>However, the Convention on Biological Diversity also requires states 
to provide a prior informed consent regime for the indigenous people 
who are the owners of these resources. It is important to have a common 
policy on the means by which the prior informed consent of indigenous 
and local communities is to be sought. In many cases, a collateral 
materials or information transfer agreement is entered into with the 
group or persons who are supplying either samples or knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Sometimes an intermediary organisation will enter into collecting 
agreements with indigenous people on behalf of the research body 
which is to receive the samples. The terms of the agreement will usually 
include respect for local customs, procedures for obtaining consent, 
agreed rates for samples andlor knowledge. In some cases companies 
have entered into more complex arrangements that involve funding 
sustainable use activities by communities. It may be appropriate to limit 
the term of the agreement to a fixed exploration period and to provide 
for collateral development phase contracts if ongoing supply of a 
particular material is required. 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Access to genetic resources 
</p>
<p>Other mechanisms can be used to gain a wider range of views on a 
proposal. These include public notification requirements and holding 
research proposals in a public register. However, these systems are 
expensive to operate and should not be adopted without careful 
consideration of the resource implications. 
</p>
<p>Possible monetary benefits 
</p>
<p>Monetary benefits payable under an agreement will vary from case to 
case. Some of the kinds of monetary benefits that are typically included 
in agreements are 
&bull; upfront payments 
&bull; collection fees 
&bull; share of royalties in event of commercialisation 
&bull; know-how licence fees 
&bull; support for in-country researchers or institutions. 
</p>
<p>Sample fees are usually paid to indigenous communities. Typical 
amounts for collection payments are reportedly between US$50-200 
per kilogram of raw material, depending on the difficulty involved in 
collection (Laird 1993:108-9). 
</p>
<p>An issue for serious consideration in the access regime is the 
proportion and mechanisms for distribution of royalty shares in the 
event of a marketable discovery. While those groups who have provided 
the initial sample may assume that they are entitled to receive royalties, 
this may not be an equitable outcome, in particular if the species has a 
widespread distribution. The identification of all the range of owners of 
a particular species is probably an impossible task. It may be more 
appropriate to consider mechanisms that give all resource owners in the 
country access to a pool of these funds for specific purposes, for example, 
activities that support and reward biodiversity conservation. 
</p>
<p>Possible non-monetary benefits 
</p>
<p>A review of existing access arrangements suggests that non-monetary 
benefits are the most important form of compensation flowing from 
access to genetic resources. These include 
&bull; mutual exchange of material 
&bull; improvement of genetic stock 
&bull; information exchange

</p>
<p>Benefit sharing 
Some of the most important negotiations that will occur under any access 
regime relate to the benefits that flow back to the country which provided 
the materiaL There are a number of possible beneficiaries including 
&bull; the competent national authority-to cover the costs of 
</p>
<p>administration 
&bull; any intermediary organisation, such as a university-to cover the costs 
</p>
<p>of their involvement and promote research 
&bull; conservation activities-to maintain the resource that is generating 
</p>
<p>the income 
&bull; (depending on the constitutional structure) sub-national government 
&bull; resource owners and local communities (Para 3, Contract Guidelines: 
</p>
<p>Appendix 2). 
The Manila Declaration provides some guidance about suggested 
</p>
<p>division of proceeds between different bodies involved in a collection 
process. It suggests that 
&bull; '60 per cent of any income arising from supply of extracts to 
</p>
<p>commercial organisations should be returned to the appropriate 
country organisation' 
</p>
<p>&bull; the country organisation should receive '51 per cent of any royalties 
arising from external collaboration that results in marketable 
products' (a fair royalty is suggested to be of the order of 3-5 per 
cent) (Para 4, Contract Guidelines: Appendix 2). 
Benefits, and the arrangements for their distribution, are likely to vary 
</p>
<p>considerably between different agreements. 
</p>
<p>Mechanisms for distributing benefits 
Distribution of benefits to resource owners is a difficult issue in any 
context. Where payments are made for samples collected, the issues are 
comparatively simple. Individuals and families who supply material are 
paid at the agreed rate. Where communal knowledge is accessed, or 
where royalty shares are being distributed, the arrangements for 
</p>
<p>164 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Access to genetic resources 
</p>
<p>distribution are likely to be more complex. Incorporated land groups or 
agency arrangements may be an appropriate mechanisms. Trust 
arrangements could also be used, although at least one commentator has 
criticised the use of trusts on the basis that they are a culturally foreign 
concept for indigenous people (Simpson 1997:157). 
</p>
<p>Future directions 
Countries that are looking to develop a more formal approach to 
allowing access to their genetic diversity have a wide range of 
information available to them. Unfortunately, not much information is 
collected together in an accessible form. Websites, publications in 
technical journals and a handful of text books are available. A number of 
international and regional bodies are developing an expertise in this area. 
They include the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, 
World Wildlife Fund, Working Group on Traditional Resource Rights 
and the Malaysian-based Third World Network. A substantial amount 
of work has also been done by the African Centre for Technology 
Studies, based in Nairobi. 
</p>
<p>The range of examples of other countries' experience in developing 
access regimes should be carefully evaluated. Many of the countries who 
have enacted access laws already have quite sophisticated administrative 
systems and more resoutces than small Pacific island nations. The 
suitability of their models should not be automatically presumed. 
However, they may offer a useful basis for developing a simpler, more 
streamlined and cost-effective approach. 
</p>
<p>Within and outside government there are a wide array of stakeholders 
whose interests need to be accommodated in developing a system for 
regulating access. These include 
&bull; biologists and biological research bodies 
&bull; forestry regulatory authorities and research bodies 
&bull; forest industry representatives 
&bull; environment protection and conservation authorities 
&bull; agricultural research bodies and industry representatives 
&bull; organisations working in the non-government sector with an interest 
</p>
<p>in conservation and rural development 
&bull; local and indigenous communities and sub-national governments. 
</p>
<p>All these stakeholders will be required to participate in effective 
implementation and their acceptance of its suitability to their needs is 
essential.

<p>A strategic plan for the establishment of an access regime (including 
the development of model access agreements, establishment of a 
competent national authority and so on) should be developed. A 
strategic plan should help to identifY the cost implications of the 
proposal and ensure that it will possible to implement it. 
</p>
<p>The importance of regional coordination of efforts to establish access 
regimes cannot be underestimated. Some of the possible benefits of 
regional cooperation are

</p>
<p>Conclusion 
The debate in Papua New Guinea abour how to protect sovereign 
interests in genetic resources has so far concentrated mainly on 
intellectual property rights. Some of the discussion is misinformed. For 
example, the suggestion that a wide variety of species of animals and 
plants could be patented is unrealistic in view of the cost of obtaining 
patents. In any case patents of this kind would not conform to the 
international standards for patent law because products of nature are not 
patentable unless they are a new variety produced through artificial 
breeding. Rather than whole species, the issues about intellectual 
property rights relate to processes and products that have been 
developed on the basis of information obtained from genetic material. 
</p>
<p>Intellectual property law is a complex and highly specialised area. Its 
application to biotechnology and pharmacology is even more 
complicated and specialised. It is important that the debate in Papua 
New Guinea be informed by those who are knowledgeable about these 
areas so that the issues are understood in their proper context. 
</p>
<p>This chapter has considered the issues involved in establishing a 
system for protection that does not rely on intellectual property rights. 
Instead, it works on the basis of a gatekeeper mechanism. Quite simply, 
access to biological resources would not be allowed except on certain 
terms and conditions dictated by government, including terms relating 
</p>
<p>166 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Access to genetic resources 
</p>
<p>to the intellectual property (and benefits from its use) arising from any 
discovery made in Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>Instituting a system of controlling access is a relatively simple matter 
legally, but has significant resource implications. It is probably beyond 
the capacity of existing government agencies to operate such a system 
effectively. Furthermore, the task of regulation becomes more 
complicated when issues of indigenous rights are considered. 
</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which indigenous owners of biological resources 
(not just in the location where they are accessed, but everywhere in 
Papua New Guinea) are involved in decision making, and share in 
benefits, are likely to involve a substantial infrastructure. These issues 
challenge Papua New Guinea's community and policymakers to think 
creatively and laterally about how to do much more with much less, 
perhaps through the involvement of agencies outside government in 
partnerships to implement the new regulatory mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>In the thick of this debate, it is important not to lose sight of the final 
goal (in the words of Papua New Guinea's Fourth National Goal): 'to 
secure the conservation of natural resources and the environment for the 
collective benefit of future generations'. One thing is certain: without 
some intervention, however indequate, the current generation will fail in 
its challenge to secure the future for its children.

</p>
<p>The role of scientist, scholar and lawyer should be to provide information and ideas, 
not to undertake the redefining of intellectual property rights. That should occur as 
the result of practice and experimentation by local communities. One thing is 
certain: the concept is not defined, and indeed, should not be defined in the 
immediate future (Posey 1994:240) 
</p>
<p>In September 1996, following a prolonged negotiation process lasting 
nearly three years, organisations representing the Aguaruna people of the 
Peruvian Amazon signed bioprospecting agreements with Washington 
University and the pharmaceutical arm of the Monsanto corporation, 
Searle and Company. The agreements provide for the collection and use 
of medicinal plants and associated traditional knowledge in the research 
and development of new pharmaceutical products. 
</p>
<p>The framework for negotiating the agreements was provided by the 
International Collaborative Biodiversity Group,l which seeks to 
encourage the establishment of consortia of private sector, academic 
institutions and local actors for the research and development of new 
products through sustainable use of genetic resources. The agreements 
use a traditional contractual format, but in an innovative way and with 
the inclusion of novel terms and conditions. Their main aim is to secure 
indigenous peoples' constant control over the collection and use of their 
knowledge, innovations and practices throughout the process of 
commercial research and development. Negotiation of the agreements 
involved finding a means to overcome some of the most controversial 
elements of the natural resource trade. 
</p>
<p>169 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Of particular importance in establishing these arrangements was the 
recognition of the reduced lead time which use of indigenous knowledge 
signifies for research and development activities. It was decided that the 
knowledge should be the subject of a specific know-how agreement, 
providing for an annual licence fee and advance royalties. The annual 
licence fee would be payable throughout research and development 
activities, and advance royalties would be paid in accordance with a 
schedule of milestones linked to clinical trials and new drug 
applications. 
</p>
<p>The agreements take the form of a contract for the collection of biological 
material and a separate know-how licence for use of indigenous knowledge. 
They were drafted in this way to prevent the acquisition of monopolistic 
rights, which might be used to limit the capacity of indigenous peoples to 
continue to use, share or market their biological resources, medicinal 
products or knowledge. It also secures recognition of the right of 
indigenous people to be compensated for use of their knowledge even 
where that knowledge has fallen into the public domain. 
</p>
<p>At the time these agreements were negotiated, there was no legislation 
in Peru governing access to genetic resources, or a regime to recognise 
and protect indigenous collective property interests. Given these 
constraints, the agreements are far from perfect. The process of their 
negotiation has, however, catalysed action by national authorities to 
draft and circulate legislation for the establishment of a sui generis regime 
for protection of collective property. This draft proposal will implement 
the provisions of Article 64 of Peru's new industrial property law, 
adopted in May 1996. This law gives the Ministry of Industry the 
power to adopt a special regime to protect the rights of indigenous 
peoples over their knowledge, including, if appropriate, the 
establishment of a register of knowledge interests. 
</p>
<p>This chapter is an attempt to draw some conclusions about potential 
mechanisms for protecting indigenous rights. It is based on experience 
gained while participating in the negotiation of the International 
Collaborative Biodiversity Group contracts, as legal adviser to the 
Aguarunas; and while serving as a member of the national working 
group for the development of legislation for a sui generis regime to 
protect indigenous collective property. The chapter examines a proposal, 
of which the author has previously been a sponsor, to use intellectual 
property regimes as a way of ensuring that prior informed consent 
becomes a condition for commercial use of traditional knowledge.

<p>The search for an interim solution 
</p>
<p>The search for mechanisms to protect indigenous peoples' rights 
should begin from the position that any solution must come from 
indigenous peoples themselves. At present therefore, the most that can 
be achieved is the development of interim mechanisms that prevent the 
continued erosion of indigenous control over their collective property. 
Mechanisms of this kind should seek to provide indigenous peoples with 
the means to regulate use of their resources in a manner that ensures 
protection for present and future generations, and to secure equitable 
sharing of benefits derived from use. With that in mind, the proposals 
below may be seen as potential preliminary steps on the long road to 
equity. 
</p>
<p>Issues in developing regimes for indigenous and collective 
</p>
<p>property rights 
</p>
<p>A technical discussion of how to protect rights over local and indigenous 
community knowledge must start from an understanding of what is to 
be protected, the nature of the material, its ownership, who would 
protect it, and against whom protection would be enforced. It must also 
consider the reasons why protection is being granted. Is it to prevent 
use, stimulate the market or promote innovation? If the means is to 
achieve the end, it is important to clarify these issues before developing 
the mechanism for protection. If, for example, indigenous communities 
primarily seek financial reward, then the approach adopted must be one 
which maximises returns. If, on the other hand, the main objective is to 
prevent unapproved use, or to impede use altogether, then a strict and 
demanding access regime might be what is sought. 
</p>
<p>Elements of an access regime 
</p>
<p>Analysis of the writings of commentators is helpful in identifying some 
fundamental issues that must be included in any regime to protect 
indigenous and local community collective property. The following 
features appear among the most widely identified objectives for an 
access regIme 
&bull; ensure recognition of the collective nature of the knowledge, both 
</p>
<p>within and among generations of indigenous peoples 
&bull; ensure that control of the use of knowledge remains firmly in the 
</p>
<p>hands of indigenous peoples, even where such information is found 
within the so-called public domain 
</p>
<p>171 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>&bull; ensure that the exercise of rights by any community, group of comm-
unities, people or peoples does not infringe the rights of other comm-
unities or peoples to use, dispose of or otherwise control their resources 
</p>
<p>&bull; avoid creating monopolistic rights over knowledge, and prevent the 
possibility of the acquisition of monopolistic rights over knowledge or 
the biological resources with which it is associated 
</p>
<p>&bull; ensure equitable benefit sharing within and among communities 
&bull; assist in the revaluation of indigenous knowledge, promote traditional 
</p>
<p>use and minimise adverse impacts on resources and cultures 
&bull; establish a presumption that the use of resources over which there 
</p>
<p>exists knowledge, in particular regarding medicinal plants, implies use 
of that knowledge. 
These objectives reflect the interests of the custodians of knowledge. 
</p>
<p>In an ideal world the solution adopted would ensure complete 
compliance with these goals. But given practical realities, it is also 
necessary to consider a number of other questions. For instance, what 
capacity do national authorities have to establish a mechanism that can 
ensure realisation of these objectives? How can transaction costs be kept 
down? (If the system is too expensive benefits will end up being 
consumed by maintenance costs and will not reach communities.) 
</p>
<p>There are also important questions about dealing with rights on 
behalf of a collective. Can all communities and custodians of relevant 
knowledge be identified, and if so, is it feasible that they all be required 
to give consent for its use? What happens when these communities live 
in neighbouring countries? How can the use of material in the public 
domain be prevented? How can equitable sharing of benefits within 
communities be achieved without being paternalistic? How can sharing 
among communities, in particular those that do not have a history of 
cooperation, be achieved, again without resorting to paternalism? In 
what form should information be held in a register, and for what 
purpose? If the value of the knowledge is in keeping it confidential, how 
can the system ensure that potential users are aware of the identity of 
communities that must be consulted about the use of knowledge? 
</p>
<p>Coupled with these questions-about communities and their 
relationships with each other and government-are other questions 
about the role of private sector actors. With whom should they 
negotiate? Options include the whole community, custodians of 
particular knowledge or shamans, healers or leaders. How can legal 
certainty be secured so that the company is protected against future

<p>The search for an interim solution 
</p>
<p>claims brought by other custodians of knowledge following development 
of an interesting product? Should warranties be sought from indigenous 
peoples regarding their right to enter into agreements? Can indigenous 
peoples be required to accept confidentiality obligations regarding 
research and development reports, and if so, will they be in a position to 
comply? To what extent are companies responsible for ensuring equity in 
distribution of benefits within and amongst communities? Should 
companies be obliged to pay royalties after patents expire? What 
happens when competitors are not paying royalties for information in 
the public domain? Is it fair that companies who entered into 
agreements should be prejudiced in competition with companies that 
are not paying royalties? 
</p>
<p>These questions identifY only some of the significant issues to be taken 
into consideration in the search for an adequate and functional regime to 
protect knowledge rights. Although many articles have addressed the lack 
of adequate protection, and the inadequacies of existing intellectual 
property regimes, to date only a handful of proposals have been circulated 
which offer potential solutions to the problem. 
</p>
<p>Sui generis systems 
The major proposals made so far, other than those which identifY 
limited possibilities for use of existing intellectual property rights 
regimes, have focused primarily on development of sui generis protection 
and on the modification of reporting requirements under existing intell-
ectual property rights application procedures. Although there appears to 
be a belief in some quarters that they are mutually exclusive, it is 
suggested here that an approach which incorporates both sui generis 
regimes and modification of existing intellectual property rights regimes 
may prove most appropriate. The former provides an avenue for recog-
nition and protection of indigenous rights, and facilitates their exercise, 
and the latter serves to limit the possibilities for unapproved use of 
indigenous and local community resources in importing countries. 
</p>
<p>History of development of alternative models 
</p>
<p>The two major influences on the sui generis debate are the well known 
works of Gurdial Singh Nijar (1995) and Darryl Posey (19%a). Nijar's 
proposal for a collective property register, which has been circulating for 
a number of years, would entitle indigenous peoples to register their 
</p>
<p>173 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>knowledge and utilise registration to control commercial use. Posey, on 
the other hand, focuses on an array of existing rights that together 
provide for recognition and protection of what he terms traditional 
resource rights. His model seeks, through recognition of a bundle of 
rights, to ensure the most comprehensive respect for, and protection of, 
indigenous and local community interests. However, Posey's proposal 
does not presume to provide the format for a system of protection. 
Rather, it identifies existing regimes each of which, when treated in 
unison, provide for recognition of and protection for indigenous rights, 
</p>
<p>While any regime should be developed with close attention to the 
bundle of rights Posey has identified, a mechanism must be found that 
can be applied as soon as possible to address the increasing 
uncompensated, unapproved use of indigenous knowledge, innovation 
and practices. For this purpose a more specific proposal regarding the 
format of legislation to recognise rights is required. 
</p>
<p>Nijar's proposal provides a basic format around which such a rights 
regime might be structured. The underlying principle that community 
rights can be recognised, registered and defended against unapproved 
use, while not impeding traditional transfers, is alluring. However, while 
Nijar proposes that these rights should be non-monopolistic, the right 
to impede commercial use does carry monopolistic connotations. 
Furthermore, while his proposal suggests a right that can be defended 
against abuse by third parties, he does not explain how local and 
indigenous communities could monitor international product 
development and intellectual property rights applications in order to 
control unapproved use of resources. 
</p>
<p>A third difficulty, and one that is common to the whole debate about 
indigenous rights, relates to the treatment of prior informed consent. 
This concept expresses the desire to ensure that all communities who 
share knowledge approve of its use. However, except where a number of 
communities share a commonality of purpose, this kind of approval 
would be all but impossible to secure. This is true even if it were 
possible to identify all the custodians of the relevant knowledge, A 
proposal that requires consent by all communities could effectively serve 
as a veto over the exercise of collective property rights, even by a 
majority of the communities' custodians of traditional knowledge. While 
this may be considered desirable in some cases (for example, to prevent 
cultural disintegration), it does not overcome the continuing problem of 
unapproved use, nor does it necessarily conform with the dynamic 
</p>

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The search for an interim solution 
</p>
<p>nature of indigenous societies and their right to adapt to development 
opportunities. Furthermore, it fails to respond to their need to find a 
means to protect their cultures in a globalised economy. The 
requirement for unanimous consent may even conflict with traditional 
decision making practices of many indigenous peoples, which might 
include weighted voting powers of elders and other important members 
of the society, or a form of majority decision making. 
</p>
<p>Despite the possible limitations of Nijar's proposal it does provide a 
good starting point for discussion of a mechanism for protection of 
indigenous interests. The tension between recognition of rights to prevent 
use and adoption of a non-monopolistic philosophy are not insurmount-
able. His proposal cannot, however, stand alone. It must be incorporated 
into a wider regime which includes international as well as national 
control mechanisms. If such an approach is taken, then freedom for 
indigenous and local communities to exchange information, in accord-
ance with time honored non-monopolistic values, may be maintained. 
</p>
<p>In summary, a comprehensive collective rights regime would include 
both a sui generis national regime and a multilateral agreement for 
conditional use of knowledge, based on demonstrated prior informed 
consent for such use. 
</p>
<p>Suggested elements of a sui generis regime 
The following proposal is a list of the principal elements that should be 
considered in the establishment of any collective rights regime. It is not 
intended to be exhaustive, and the principles set out below might be 
most appropriately considered as minimum conditions. 
Inherent nature of the rights. The rights of indigenous and local 
communities over the product of their intellectual effort stem from their 
development of knowledge, innovations and practices and not from any 
act of government. 
Rights may still exist in public domain material. Indigenous rights over 
knowledge, innovations and practices exist whether or not the 
information is considered to be within the public domain. The fact that 
information may be freely distributed by indigenous and local 
communities should not be seen as impeding their right to limit its use 
for commercial or scientific purposes, or for uses which are otherwise 
contrary to their spiritual or cultural morals. All prospective users must 
therefore be required to seek and obtain the prior informed consent of 
custodians of traditional knowledge.

<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>There is a commonly held misconception that material in the public 
domain cannot be the subject of intellectual property rights. However, 
within the United States, European Union and Japan there are examples 
of material that is protected in the public domain, including writings 
and designs. These experiences, which in the case of Japan and the 
European Union occurred within the last decade, are likely to be 
precedents for further efforts to protect public domain material. Similar 
protection of indigenous knowledge is therefore a possibility. 
Cultural patrimony. The traditional knowledge rights of indigenous and 
local communities are collective in nature, both inter and 
intragenerationally, and should be recognised as cultural patrimony.2 
These rights therefore cannot be alienated. 
Distinguish indigenous rights from national sovereign rights. Where 
biological resources are considered national patrimony, there should be a 
clear distinction between the rights of the state over these resources and 
the collective property rights of indigenous peoples over their 
knowledge, innovations and practices, During the International 
Collaborative Biodiversity Group negotiations it was decided to adopt a 
contractual regime which clearly separated the benefits received for use 
of biological resources from the benefits received for use of knowledge. 
This was done to avoid the possibility of state intervention in benefit 
distribution, because of concerns that this would lead to an exhaustion 
of benefits in administrative overheads. 
Intellectual property rights should not be monopolistic. Agreements for 
use must ensure that any intellectual property rights obtained by users 
cannot be utilised to prevent traditional use, or the sale, licensing or use 
of knowledge, innovations or practices, in any part of the world. They 
should also ensure that any rights (including patents) that are obtained 
on the basis of indigenous knowledge cannot be used to prevent the use, 
sale or licensing of those resources in any part of the world. 
</p>
<p>In many cases, agreements will not include all the custodians of 
particular knowledge. For example, on the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border 
five distinct indigenous tribes, all belonging to the Jivaro ethnic group-
ing, hold much of the same knowledge. It is important that an agree-
ment such as the International Collaborative Biodiversity Group 
Peruvian agreement, which involved one of these tribes, the Aguarunas, 
should not prevent the other tribes from benefiting from their knowledge. 
</p>
<p>It is also important to ensure that compositional matter patents 
obtained by companies are not used to prevent the use or sale of 
</p>
<p>176 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The search for an interim solution 
</p>
<p>medicinal plants containing the patented matter. Cases may arise where 
a company finds and patents compositional matter for a specific anti-
cancer end. For example, it is very possible that if an indigenous people 
were to sell their medicinal plant within a protected market, with 
allusion to its anti-cancer properties, the sale could be challenged as a 
breach of the compositional matter patent. 
Ownership of knowledge should be presumed &amp;om use of resources. 
The regime should establish a legal presumption that use of biological 
resources presumes ownership of knowledge about the properties of 
those resources. This presumption should operate where resources have 
historically been used by indigenous peoples or local communities for 
medicinal, biopesticide, phsycoactive or toxic purposes; or where the 
important characteristics of cultivated resources are confined to cultivars 
in clearly identifiable ecosystems. In such cases the rights to use the 
resource should be dependent on the user having a valid license to use 
the related knowledge. 
Licences should be non-exclusive. While it is desirable that prior 
informed consent should be sought from all custodians of knowledge, 
innovations and practices, this may be impossible in many cases, at least 
for the moment. As such it is considered preferable that any contract or 
licences for the use of collective property should be of a non-exclusive 
nature.3 
</p>
<p>Review procedures. Any regime that recognises collective rights should 
establish administrative and judicial review procedures that allow cust-
odians of knowledge, who are not party to an agreement, to challenge 
agreements for use of such knowledge in clearly defined circumstances. 
Challenges of this kind should be permitted on the basis that 
&bull; the contracting community or people are not legitimate custodians of 
</p>
<p>the relevant knowledge 
&bull; benefit sharing is inadequate 
&bull; commercialisation of knowledge would undermine the culture or the 
</p>
<p>people, or run counter to their spiritual beliefs 
&bull; commercialisation could lead to genetic erosion, loss of access for 
</p>
<p>traditional uses or lead to undesirable incursions onto indigenous 
territories. 
</p>
<p>Equitable benefit sharing. The regime should establish mechanisms to 
secure equitable sharing of benefits among all custodians of collective 
property, whether or not they are parties to a contract for its use. The 
Peruvian International Collaborative Biodiversity Group project requires 
</p>
<p>177 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>the participating indigenous organisations to establish a mechanism for 
distribution of benefits which will ensure equitable distribution among 
all Aguaruna and Huambisa peoples, whether or not they are party to 
the agreement. It is envisaged that a form of trust fund may be 
established, with representatives of the five river basins inhabited by the 
Aguarunas and Huambisas on its management board. 
</p>
<p>Benefits should be administered by indigenous peoples themselves. 
However, as this is collective property, it will be necessary to ensure that 
benefits are distributed in a transparent fashion and that the interests of 
future generations have taken into consideration. The commercial value 
of traditional knowledge may be exhausted once patents obtained over 
derivatives of medicinal plants have expired. To this extent custodians 
have an obligation to ensure that benefits received are used to the advan-
tage of both present and future generations. Investment in development 
projects, securing land and resource rights, conservation of the environ-
ment and strengthening traditional knowledge systems are all avenues 
by which benefits may be more equitably distributed over generations. 
</p>
<p>The state has an obligation to promote equitable benefit sharing in 
accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity. Indigenous 
peoples should be advised that if they fail to ensure equitable benefit 
sharing with other custodians, the state may intervene. 
Register of collective property. The regime should provide for a register 
of indigenous and local community collective property to assist national 
authorities in determining which communities, or peoples, should be 
informed and consulted regarding proposed contracts for the use of their 
collective property, and among whom benefits should be shared. This 
register would only be declaratory, and would not purport to define 
which communities have rights. No benefits should accrue to those 
communities who are registered, beyond the benefit of their identific-
ation-to the government and potential users-as interested parties. 
</p>
<p>A multilateral system to secure prior informed consent 
</p>
<p>Any national regime is, by its nature, restricted in its application to the 
territory within its jurisdictional boundaries. The major commercial 
markets in which infringements are most likely to occur are generally 
located in countries other than those from which the knowledge and 
resources were sourced. The economic and logistical difficulties which 
indigenous and local communities face in policing the use of their 
</p>
<p>178 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>The search for an interim solution 
</p>
<p>collective property limits the effectiveness of any regime which requires 
custodians to monitor and challenge abuses of rights. 
</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is proposed that any national regime should be 
complemented by a market-based mechanism that would reverse the 
burden of proving the right to use a resource. At present, applicants for 
patents and other intellectual property rights are not required to 
demonstrate their right to use the knowledge or resources on which 
their application is based. Instead, indigenous groups who seek to 
challenge patents must establish that the applicant does not have that 
right. It is proposed to reverse this onus, and to place the burden of 
proving the right to use knowledge or resources on the user, rather than 
on the country of origin or its local and indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>While the idea of using the market as a means to prevent 'biopiracy' 
is seen by some commentators as the tip of the iceberg through which 
collective property would eventually be expropriated, an objective 
consideration leads to a contrary conclusion. In fact the proposal for 
certificates of origin set out below should not be seen as one which will 
convert collective property into a negotiable commodity of itself. On the 
contrary, what is promoted is a mechanism which ensures that, where 
use of knowledge, innovations and practices has not been the subject of 
prior informed consent, the opportunities for the user to commercialise 
any resultant product or process will be severely limited. 
</p>
<p>Adopting the premise that indigenous and local communities are 
mainly concerned to prevent the unapproved use of their knowledge, 
including in some cases any form of commercialisation, the following 
proposal is directed toward controlling these activities. It is based on an 
assumption that the desire to access and use knowledge is directly 
proportional to the potential commercial return to the user. Limiting 
the possibilities of commercial reward for unapproved use should in turn 
induce users to seek prior informed consent. It should therefore be seen 
as an instrument of control rather than an aid to commercialisation. 
</p>
<p>Incorporating prior informed consent into existing 
</p>
<p>intellectual property rights systems 
</p>
<p>The ability of a company to make money from a product or process, and 
therefore their willingness to invest in research and development, is 
closely linked to the security of intellectual property rights protection. 
Increasingly, profit potential is also linked to product approval processes 
</p>
<p>179 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>supervised by national and international standards organisations. The 
existing regimes for product approval and intellectual property rights 
have developed over many years. They have been the subject of intense 
debate, which continues to the present and is likely to continue. The 
principles underlying these regimes are the subject of divergent views. 
They are considered by many to be doctrine, by others to represent the 
evil of capitalistic monopolisation. Given these polarised viewpoints, it 
seems unlikely that the fundamental tenets of these regimes can be 
altered, at least in the short term. 
</p>
<p>The proposal described below seeks to avoid becoming enmeshed in 
that greater debate; rather than challenging the substantive elements of 
existing regimes, it focuses on modifYing their application procedures. 
This approach has the additional advantage that, if it is agreed on, it 
could be implemented by national authorities and standards bodies 
through administrative rather than legislative means, thereby offering 
protection in the short rather than the long term. Furthermore, these 
proposed modifications would still meet the requirements of Article 27 
of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement, so no 
modification of that agreement would be needed to implement it. 
</p>
<p>Numerous commentators have come to the conclusion that requiring 
identification of the source of genetic resources and knowledge in 
patents would help to bring their use to the attention of their 
custodians. This common view has emerged from a number of 
individuals whose thinking developed separately in different parts of the 
world. This convergence of opinion tends to suggest that, not only is a 
market-based tool a valid option, it is probably the most practical 
mechanism for monitoring and controlling use of knowledge. 
</p>
<p>Identification of genetic content and use of knowledge in a patent 
does not necessarily deal with the issue of prior informed consent. The 
restrictions which indigenous and local communities will face in 
policing the use of their resources and the costs of challenging an 
intellectual property rights grant must also be taken into account. The 
system must go further and provide for evidence of the right to use the 
knowledge or resources. This is most effectively achieved if there is a 
reversal of the burden of proving the right to use knowledge, from the 
custodian of that knowledge to the user. In this way the intellectual 
property rights system can employ market tools to regulate use for the 
market.

<p>The search for an interim solution 
</p>
<p>Elements of a certificate of origin scheme 
</p>
<p>The following core elements for a certificate of origin scheme are 
suggested.4 
</p>
<p>Declaration as to the right to use resources. A certificate of origin 
scheme would require that applicants for patents and other intellectual 
property rights make a sworn declaration regarding the use of genetic 
resources and associated knowledge, and provide evidence of their legal 
right to use such resources for the production of the material for which 
intellectual property rights protection is sought. Similar requirements 
could also be included in product approval procedures. 
</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration and the International Standards 
Organisation, for example, could make it a condition for receipt of 
applications that evidence of prior informed consent be included. As 
many products are not subject to patents but are commercially exploited 
on an industrial scale it is important that mechanisms be used which 
allow the control of all major commercialisation of genetic resources, 
collective property and products developed with use of such resources. 
This requirement would effectively transfer the burden of securing the 
interests of countries of origin and of indigenous and local communities 
to the user. This may be likened to the reversal of the burden of proof 
concerning production of a product over which there exists a patented 
process, found in many jurisdictions and as included in the Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement. 
Certification of origin. Evidence of the right to use resources could be 
given either by production of a contract or licence to use the knowledge, 
or in the form of a certificate issued by the competent authority of the 
country where the custodians of the knowledge reside. This certificate 
would include the names of the parties, the tangible and intangible 
resources being provided and the rights and limitations placed on the 
user. As in many cases access to knowledge will be linked to access to 
specific resources, the certificate could cover both knowledge and 
resources. 
Uniform international system. A certificate system common to all 
nations would help to harmonise procedures and prevent the need to 
interpret different contract provisions under differing legal regimes. Reid 
and La Vina (1995:10) argue that harmonised national standards and 
requirements for biodiversity trade would lessen the hurdles facing users 
of biodiversity. They suggest that a certification system established in 
</p>
<p>181 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>conjunction with national standards would help to reduce the illicit 
trade in genetic resources. 
</p>
<p>A uniform international system would also protect commercial 
confidentiality of sensitive contract details not required by the patent 
authorities. A uniform and recognisable certificate would obviate the 
need for patent offices to verifY the nature of the consent given, a role 
which they should not be required to perform. 
</p>
<p>Conclusion 
Although it is desirable that any regime to protect indigenous and local 
community interests be drafted by indigenous peoples, some form of 
protection is needed in the short term. A blend of national and 
international measures will be necessary to ensure comprehensive and 
effective protection. By recognising rights at the national level, and 
impeding use of knowledge for commercial purposes through a 
multilateral agreement requiring countries to modifY intellectual 
property rights and product approval application procedures, an interim 
mechanism can be established which would effectively prevent 
unapproved commercial use of knowledge. 
</p>
<p>The Conference of the Parties for the Convention on Biological 
Diversity should be asked to establish an ad hoc experts group on 
collective property, with a mandate to consider possibilities for adoption 
of an international accord on indigenous and local community 
knowledge rights. This group must include representatives of indigenous 
peoples and should commence a global participative process to 
determine the format that such a regime should take.

<p>2 Article 24 of the new Peruvian Law on the Conservation and

they hold rights over it and are entitled to decide over its use. 
</p>
<p>3 It is possible that a specific community or group of communities 
have a body of knowledge which is not shared with other indigenous 
peoples, and that all the custodians agree to give an exclusive right to 
a particular user. There may be good commercial reasons for doing so, 
as well as reasons relating to maintenance of control over the 
knowledge. In such an instance exclusivity may be appropriate in so 
far as the rights are granted under licence, may be revoked for non-
compliance and do not preclude future generations from utilising the 
knowledge to their benefit.

<p>Appendix 
</p>
<p>summaries of small group 
discussions 
</p>
<p>Discussion group 1: John Sengo presenter 
How can Papua New Guinea most effectively assert its national 
sovereignty over biological and cultural resources within its borders? 
</p>
<p>The group considered the question of sovereignty over the sustainable 
use of biological and cultural resources within communities including 
the sovereignty of the national government, provincial governments, 
local governments and local communities over their resources. The 
group felt that asserting sovereignty is important to prevent and/or 
control exploitation of national resources for profit by both in and out-
of-country researchers and developers. In addition, Papua New Guinea 
should allow access to its resources only under certain conditions. In all 
circumstances, ownership of resources by local people must be 
recognised along with their sovereignty over those resources. 
</p>
<p>Group recommendations 
</p>
<p>&bull; In the absence of legislation and accompanying rules and regulations, 
policies protecting cultural and biological property rights should be 
developed and implemented. Education and awareness activities 
should be conducted throughout the country to teach people 
about their biological and cultural property rights. In this way, 
the local custodians of land, knowledge, and traditions will 
become aware of their rights and the importance of protecting 
</p>
<p>184 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Appendix 
</p>
<p>their resources. Education and awareness activities should a) 
encourage people to document their biological and cultural 
knowledge, and b) create places to store this information to 
prevent its loss. It is important that traditional knowledge does 
not disappear with the people who possess it; while it is a good 
idea to publish it, that does not necessarily include selling it. It is 
most important to keep a record of it. 
</p>
<p>e A working group should be created to look at existing legislation in 
order to a) determine how it could be improved to effectively protect 
sovereignty over biological and cultural property, and b) develop any 
additional rules and regulations needed to meet desired levels of 
protection for biological and cultural property rights. With this in 
mind, it was proposed that the existing copyright law should be 
implemented, but that patent law should be considered more 
carefully and drafted only when its implications to Papua New 
Guinea are thoroughly understood. In addition to enacting copyright 
law, access legislation to implement the Convention on Biological 
Diversity should be drafted, and profit-sharing mechanisms based on 
the potential for commercial development of biological and cultural 
resources should be crafted. 
</p>
<p>&bull; A working group should be established to develop a code of conduct 
for researchers in Papua New Guinea. Such a code of conduct should 
provide guidelines to access cultural and biological property and can 
be used in advance of developing new legislation. A monitoring 
scheme also should be developed to evaluate implementation of a 
code of conduct. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Access agreements should be signed before any access to biological 
and cultural resources is provided. Such an agreement should require 
negotiation of access on a case-by-case basis before access occurs, and 
should emphasise that cultural and biological resources are owned by 
local people and that there will be no access to resources without this 
recognition and understanding. In addition, access agreements should 
include provisions for in-country counterparts-individuals or 
institutions-and for benefit-sharing information should commercial 
exploitation result. 
</p>
<p>Questions 
</p>
<p>How much can be protected by copyright? For example, who and how 
do you protect in a situation where someone records an oral legend? The 
</p>
<p>185 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>original author or the recorder? Can we develop a community copyright 
and patent? 
</p>
<p>In some countries people have asked that none of this information be 
published until there is a mechanism in place to deal with this issue. It 
may also be useful to put a notice in the beginning of published 
material to indicate that by reading the material the reader has accepted 
the terms of its license, that is, that the information contained within is 
derived from indigenous people and if the reader wants to use it she or 
he must get permission from and provide some benefit to the originators 
of the information. The most fundamental question is that of ownership 
and the issue of collective versus the private ownership of knowledge. 
Can one be transformed into the other and if so, how?

<p>Discussion group 2: Nick Araho presenter 
What types of intellectual property protection should Papua New 
Guinea implement, if any, and what types of information should they 
protect? 
</p>
<p>This discussion group raised many interesting issues came up' which did 
not directly answer the question but were important concerns. The 
group began by asking 'What do we want to protect?' and divided the 
question into biological issues and cultural issues. The objective of 
protection generally focused on the conservation of cultural traditions 
and safeguarding biological resources from the misuse and destruction 
by others. However, this does not necessarily mean that resources 
shouldn't be exploited. It was recognised that the type of protection 
desired would depend on the type of information at issue. 
</p>
<p>186 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Appendix 
</p>
<p>Protection of culture was viewed as important to preserve cultural 
identity and knowledge, to sustain traditions, to prevent 
misrepresentation and misunderstanding, to revitalise and redirect 
Papua New Guinea's youth, and to gain benefits from the use of culture. 
Not only would those currently living in Papua New Guinea benefit, 
but future generations, in and out-of-country researchers, and other 
cultures throughout the world would benefit from cultural safeguards. 
Threats to culture include researchers, missionaries, oblivion and 
misrepresentation by individuals or institutions. The group noted that 
culture itself is constantly changing and therefore it is important to 
recognise that it can't be preserved as a static entity; rather the 
relationships embedded in culture must be protected and its fluidity 
accepted. 
</p>
<p>Protection of biological resources was viewed as important to ensure 
the sustainable use of resources, to prevent overexploitation, to study 
and understand the resources for the future, and to gain benefits. The 
group was concerned about the exploitation and destruction of 
biological resources by farmers, developers, and resource owners. The 
group expressed a need to protect biological resources for future 
generations, farmers, researchers, and for the planetary ecosystem. 
</p>
<p>Recommendations 
</p>
<p>&bull; Borrowing information between groups characterises Papua New 
Guinea; nobody should interfere with that. The sharing of 
information in Papua New Guinea only requires permission or the 
exchange of certain gifts. Thus, no actions should be taken that might 
stop the flow of information exchange through traditional channels. It 
is important to continue to be able to borrow and share from other 
Papua New Guineans. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The group questioned whether international treaties regarding 
intellectual property will be useful or detrimental to Papua New 
Guinea in the short and long-term. They are constructed from 
outside Papua New Guinea by developed countries and revolve 
around commercial value. It may be more appropriate to develop 
mechanisms to control the exploitation of commercial endeavors and 
to control the exchange of information and resources in Papua New 
Guinea rather than begin legislating these issues right away. 
Establishing some type of mechanism to regulate entities from 
</p>
<p>187 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>outside who want to use information originating in Papua New 
Guinea for commercial value is where we need to focus now. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Customary law in Papua New Guinea is an important concept. It 
responds to and has the potential to resolve a lot of concerns at the 
village and local level. People shouldn't forget about this when 
considering mechanisms to regulate the exchange of information 
because it can be useful to resolve conflicts related to information 
exchange in villages and towns. The use of mediation to determine 
just outcomes is a feature of customary law; this isn't taken into 
account in statutory law. Thus, we should pay careful attention to the 
role that customary laws can play in Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Whatever mechanisms are developed to regulate the exchange of 
information in Papua New Guinea, they must be reciprocal and 
ensure that information comes back into Papua New Guinea to help 
people in villages. For example, people who come to Papua New 
Guinea to do research should provide the results of that research to 
the village and explain what it means and why it is important. In this 
way the value of this information will be increased because it will have 
value to local communities and its reciprocal exchange will create the 
potential for partnership ventures. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The definition of property under most legal regimes, and particularly 
in international treaties and conventions, is a western concept. It is 
vital to figure out what the characteristics of property are in Papua 
New Guinea and to work within our particular cultural framework. 
</p>
<p>Questions 
</p>
<p>Why should we focus exclusively on information exchange with outside 
entities when we can also be manipulated from within? 
</p>
<p>We should be more concerned about outsiders because they have 
more power/money and therefore a greater potential to use us to their 
own advantage without any recourse. Within our own system we have 
the advantage of checks and balances to help us work out internal 
problems of exploitation.

<p>Discussion group 3: Randy Thaman presenter 
What mechanisms can Papua New Guinea employ to recognise and 
protect indigenous knowledge, art, and practices that respect their 
collective (or individual) ownership and origin? 
</p>
<p>The group initially identified many different kinds of knowledge, art, 
and practices, both traditional and modern, that they would like to see 
recognised and protected. 
Knowledge. Knowledge may be group or individual, secret or non-
secret, and sacred or non-sacred. It includes 
&bull; oral knowledge, such as that passed on through song, stories, legends 
</p>
<p>and poems 
&bull; visual arts and design 
&bull; warfare, fighting, physical performance (dance and sport) 
&bull; sexual practices and gender roles 
&bull; music 
&bull; navigation, knowledge of place, geographical knowledge, ecological 
</p>
<p>knowledge 
&bull; technical knowledge, such as gardening, medicine, fishing, weaving, 
</p>
<p>dyes, weapons, clothing manufacture 
&bull; spiritual knowledge, knowledge of sacred sites

</p>
<p>Recommendations 
</p>
<p>In the process of developing recommendations, the group noted that it 
is fundamental to recognise and give value to knowledge, art and pract-
ices in order to ensure their protection and reproduction. Some mechan-
isms for recognition will also serve to preserve intellectual property. 
Recognition mechanisms 
&bull; Awareness programs should be implemented at all levels-national, 
</p>
<p>sub-national, village, community, clan, family-to stress the import-
ance and value of knowledge, art, and practices as a foundation for 
sustainable development. Awareness programs have the potential to 
reaffirm traditions and reverse the Euro-American bias of modern 
education. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Campaigns, slogans, educational programs and local meetings could 
promote recognition that non-secret and secret knowledge is 
important, and that the secrecy should be respected. 
</p>
<p>&bull; National and local shows, festivals, and competitions (such as 
singsings, canoe races, school competitions, agricultural shows) could 
help achieve recognition and support for traditional knowledge, art 
and practices. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The publication and distribution of traditional intellectual property 
could help preserve it by promoting its value and use. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The use or employment of local experts and authorities as resource 
persons and/or through formal and informal educational systems can 
keep traditional knowledge, art and practices alive and in the public 
eye. Similarly, the designation of individuals who possess traditional 
knowledge as 'living treasures' can help promote its sustainability. 
</p>

<p>Appendix 
</p>
<p>Protection mechanisms 
&bull; Changing and promoting educational priorities to train people at all 
</p>
<p>levels, particularly at the local level, in fields relevant to the protection 
of intellectual property (including art, linguistics, performing arts, 
anthropology/ archeology, biology/systematics, architecture, 
pharmacology, chemistry) is key. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Recording and creating inventories of intellectual property (though 
writing, photography, video, song, etc.) so that it is available to the 
original creators or informants of the information and to repositories 
for national, provincial and local use. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The development of appropriate and enforceable legislation at 
national, provincial and local levels (including copyright, memoranda 
of understanding for researchers, a permit system, customary laws) are 
necessary. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The promotion of research into traditional systems of education and 
learning and then incorporating those methods into formal and 
informal educational systems, where appropriate, can help to keep 
culture alive and prevent it from being swallowed by more dominant 
cultures. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Similarly, linguistic research is important to keep local languages 
alive. Compilations of local languages can serve to record biological 
and cultural knowledge which is endangered, such as traditional 
ceremonies, foods, artwork, and the medicinal uses of plants. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Development of an integrated media strategy can help to enhance the 
protection and recognition of intellectual property and minimise the 
trivialisation and loss of biological and cultural knowledge. Moreover, 
the media should play a role in preventing the dissemination of 
inappropriate messages. A helpful strategy might be to revitalise 
provincial television stations and local television content. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Sacred sites should be registered and the individuals or land-groups 
associated with them certified as their custodians. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Cultural and biological knowledge and institutions that are 
considered 'endangered' should also be registered. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The efforts of religious bodies to respect and incorporate traditional 
beliefs into spiritual development should be supported. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Traditional environmental and cultural management strategies should 
be incorporated into all sectors of national planning and 
development-environment, tourism, fisheries, agriculture, health, 
education, mining, justice-as an integral component. 
</p>
<p>191 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual. biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>&bull; An interagency national task force consisting of representative 
membership from agencies responsible for recognising and protecting 
intellectual property, such as the National Cultural Commission, the 
National Museum, the University of Papua New Guinea, and non-
governmental organisations, should be established to promote and 
coordinate recognition and protection of intellectual property in 
Papua New Guinea. Provincial level task forces might also be created 
to interface with communities and individuals to respond to requests 
and problems related to intellectual, biological and cultural property 
rights. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Community or landowner-based biological and/or cultural protection 
action plans should be developed based on identification by local 
communities of what should be protected and recognised due to its 
value and threatened status. 
</p>
<p>Questions 
</p>
<p>The economic consequences of establishing intellectual property rights 
infrastructure would be significant. The immediate training of Papua 
New Guineans in the legal issues involved and in how to operate within 
the legal system is vital. Similarly, the nomination of Papua New 
Guineans for training abroad in other important areas is important. 
</p>
<p>High levels of training are not necessary to establish or operate 
awareness programs, nor are people from outside; it is important to 
inspire the process from within. 
</p>
<p>Databases are great for the future, but we must start the collection 
process at the local level now. Biological inventories ate also important, 
but the strategy should be to add value to the resources as they are 
inventoried. The intellectual property rights system does not provide 
benefits until you are at the cutting edge of technology. We are only at 
the beginning of the process. Thus, we need to figure out how to add 
value to our resources before we reach that point. We need to train 
people in the law and the legal issues behind intellectual property, and 
in community mediation; we need lawyers who are educated rather than 
trained. 
</p>
<p>As far as biological property goes, we need time to consider all the 
information that we have and will receive in the future. We do not know 
yet what is missing in our knowledge and need time to figure it out. It 
is important to protect it so we have time.

<p>Discussion group 4: Andrew Moutu presenter 
How can Papua New Guinea achieve international recognition for 
intellectual, biological and cultural property that builds upon the 
traditional practices of its indigenous communities? 
</p>
<p>International structures currently in existence do not necessarily reflect 
the reality of people we are talking about. The concept of tradition 
portrays an exotic idea of Papua New Guinea; we are dynamic. Papua 
New Guinea ways are better. 
Biological property. There must be prior informed consent and 
discussion of the risks and benefits. 
Biogenetic resources. A human subjects committee should be trained 
in place to address all the issues. Papua New Guineans should be in 
research and genetics. Research policy in Papua New Guinea should be 
reviewed so there is provision for reciprocity of knowledge and other 
things. 
Contracts/control. These should be designed to ensure that people are 
not exploited. 
Cultural property. Conventions recognise diversity and conception of 
cultural heritage. The place of customary law in relation to questions 
like property, ownership, price, rights (what are the conceptions?) 
should be re-examined. There is concern that within an intellectual 
property rights framework, Papua New Guinea ideas of property will not 
be seen as something that can be bought and sold. The concept of 
knowledge ownership may be transformed 
National cultural policy instituted by National Cultural Commission. 
Papua New Guinean ways of doing things must be recognised. There is 
also a need to provide a running definition of the notion of culture.

<p>193 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Copyrights. Legislation should be reviewed with reference to indigenous 
knowledge to see if it is relevant. Must copyright have a registry? Does it 
matter who gets there first? How can we protect people? 
International recognition. The capacity of any country is limited by its 
national jurisdiction. It is therefore important to bring the issue of prior 
informed consent into the international debate. Obligations should be 
imposed on companies. They must show prior informed consent when 
submitting products. We need a sui generis regime at the national level 
and a multi-national way to make use of and oversee national regimes. 
</p>
<p>Prior informed consent can be achieved over time given a regular 
dialogue. We cannot require everyone to have a doctorate in genetics, 
but we can translate these concepts into Tok Pis in and the use of 
technical language is inappropriate. However this takes time and effort 
and it is a process. 
Human subjects report. An independent person or body should have 
the responsibility to determine whether prior informed consent has 
actually occurred.

<p>Discussion group 5: Mike Parsons, Anthony Parak 
presenters 
How can Papua New Guinea effectively include provisions for prior 
informed consent, benefit-sharing and local community control in 
policies or legislation regulating natural product development? 
</p>
<p>Recommendations 
Prior informed consent 
&bull; The state should assume responsibility for ensuring that researchers 
</p>
<p>and developers have full prior informed consent. This might involve 
establishment of a body or identification of certain people who are 
responsible for ascertaining whether or not consent has been 
</p>
<p>194 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Appendix 
</p>
<p>adequately sought and approved. It might also involve a certification 
process. All parties to a natural product development project must be 
aware of all issues regarding prior informed consent at all stages of the 
project: the agreement, the project nature, the value of the project, 
the advantages and disadvantages of the project. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The people from whom consent is sought should have adequate access 
to appropriate advisors in financial, legal and technical matters 
relating to the project. This presupposes an educative process to make 
people aware of what their rights are and to help them value their 
resources in light of outside needs and uses. 
</p>
<p>&bull; It is important not to raise people's expectations. 
Benefit-sharing 
&bull; Communities or representative individuals must regulate the distrib-
</p>
<p>ution of benefits according to negotiated and accepted terms of 
agreement. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The government should provide a framework or guidelines (in the 
form of policy or legislation) for benefit-sharing, and provide support 
to ensure that it is carried out properly. This does not mean that the 
government should be interfering or micro managing the process, but 
that a broad policy framework should be developed to enable people 
to retain rights in what they sell. Examples of such frameworks exist 
in other places in the world. 
</p>
<p>Local community control 
&bull; Local community control should be changed to local community 
</p>
<p>participation. Local community participation should be promoted by 
providing technical and financial assistance in setting up natural 
product development ventures, such as teaching local people to screen 
and isolate chemicals derived from plants in Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>&bull; A national body and facility should be set up to screen and isolate 
useful properties of local genetic and biochemical materials. Crude 
screening of all raw materials should take place in-country and should 
involve the participation of local people. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The participation of local people should take into account customary 
laws, taboos, or other restrictions. There should be an administrative 
body to regulate natural product development policies and to 
promote natural products research and development. Regulation 
should cover 
</p>
<p>&bull; access to natural products, including prior informed 
consent, access rights and agreements

</p>
<p>&bull; In addition, all existing legislation covering these topics should be 
reviewed and, if necessary, amended to make them more effective. The 
group does not believe that patents or other commercial intellectual 
property laws should be implemented at this time.

<p>Discussion group 6: Mike Hedemark presenter 
How can Papua New Guinea develop a national-level strategy to 
inventory its biodiversity and integrate all collections into one physical 
and administrative entity? 
</p>
<p>The group felt strongly about two initial points. First, if Papua New 
Guinea is going to develop laws to protect the components of 
biodiversity it must first conduct an inventory of its biodiversity. It is 
important to know what's out there and what needs to be protected. 
Second, it is not a good idea to integrate all biodiversity collections into 
one physical and administrative entity. 
</p>
<p>The group then identified a number of concerns related to 
biodiversity data management. 
&bull; The availability of currently existing information in both the public 
</p>
<p>and private domain is problematic. We are looking at ways of manag-
ing biodiversity so the first step should be to develop an information 
base. 
</p>
<p>&bull; A biodiversity data management program is the first step to develop-
ing an integrated information base. Such a management program 
should address issues related to access and sharing of data (territor-
iality), policy and domicile questions (who will the coordinating 
agency be) and recovery of costs. 
</p>
<p>196 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Appendix 
</p>
<p>&bull; Government recognition and support for a revised biodiversity 
management committee is needed. The committee is not getting 
appropriate recognition now. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The process for granting and validating research permits should be 
reassessed. A code of conduct for individuals engaging in socio-
economic and scientific ventures in the field should be developed. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The biodiversity strategy framework document and process needs to 
be revitalised; it exists but has never been implemented. 
</p>
<p>&bull; National collections (the National Museum, herbaria, gardens, 
research stations) are a neglected national resource and should receive 
funding to at least prevent further deterioration. 
</p>
<p>&bull; National capacity-building in implementation of intellectual property 
rights management regimes and biodiversity potentials is needed. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Intellectual and biological property rights policy and regulations 
concerning biological products should be promoted. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The need to implement the Science and Technology Council 
legislation and policy. 
</p>
<p>Recommendations 
</p>
<p>Resources 
Long-term. The considered view of the biodiversity data management 
committee is that the development of a national-level inventory of 
biodiversity and its integration into one physical and administrative 
entity if feasible but only in the long-term. The biodiversity data 
management committee should examine strategies for working towards a 
national inventory and biodiversity inventory. This should include 
recognition of what information is already available and what needs to 
be inventoried and protected in the future. 
Short-term. The development of a biodiversity strategy and process for 
furthering biodiversity data management should include, inter alia 
&bull; a process for integrating data 
&bull; the development of protocols for integrity, access, use, and levels of 
</p>
<p>access to biodiversity data 
&bull; maintenance of current custodial responsibilities for data bases; each 
</p>
<p>organisation is appropriate for the data they hold, but they need to be 
resourced better to make them better custodians. 
</p>
<p>&bull; consideration of copyright issues in relation to databases 
&bull; increased support for non government organisations, universities, and 
</p>
<p>other groups involved with database development 
</p>
<p>197 </p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>Protection of intellectual, biological and cultural property in Papua New Guinea 
</p>
<p>Another short-term strategy should be to develop a 'natural 
collections policy' for the support and maintenance of national 
collections. 
</p>
<p>Regulation and administration 
Long-term. Papua New Guinea should develop a strategy and legislation 
on access (freedom) of information in a distributive network of 
biodiversity databases. 
Short-term 
&bull; An urgent review of the socioeconomic and scientific research permit 
</p>
<p>process is needed, as well as the development of a code of conduct for 
researchers and developers. There is currently no central depository or 
list of people who have worked in Papua New Guinea. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Papua New Guinea should establish a national committee for the 
regulation of access to the country's biological materials and its 
corresponding information. The national committee should have a 
mandate to draft policy and procedures for consideration and endor-
sement by government. Legal and community representation will be 
required in this process. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The development of an intellectual and biological property rights 
policy and strategy needs to consider the associated costs, benefits, 
and losses. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The government should establish the Science and Technology Council 
and implement approved policy initiatives. 
</p>
<p>&bull; Formal recognition and support for a revised biodiversity management 
committee needs to be provided. 
</p>
<p>&bull; The work on the biodiversity strategy framework process need to be 
revitalised. 
</p>
<p>Training needs 
Long-term. There is a need to develop a national capacity-building 
process at all levels in the implementation of intellectual property rights 
regulations by universities, relevant institutions and non government 
organisations both in-country and overseas. 
Short-term. A register of science researchers should be established 
immediately.
