<p>Preface
</p>
<p>Human gastrointestinal (GI) physiology is a study of our GI system that addresses
the regulation and integration of major physiological functions of motility, secretion,
digestion, absorption and blood flow, as well as immunity. The coordination of
these processes is vital for the maintenance of GI health; thus, any dysregulation
will result in GI disease. In fact, GI physiology is a fundamental subject that is
indispensable not only for undergraduate but also for graduate students of any
biomedical courses, including, but not limited to, medical, pharmacy, nursing,
human biology, Chinese medicine, and natural science, as well as other health-
related subjects.
</p>
<p>From my GI teaching experience over the past decade, it has always been my
wish to produce a succinct monograph that can serve as a companion book for
biomedical students not only for their initial studies, but also for their career paths.
From the students&rsquo; viewpoint, one of the most common problems they encounter
is the lack of any available textbooks that cover both the basic science and provide
relevant clinical correlations. Owing to the lack of exposure to patients with real
clinical problems, students often cannot see the whole picture of the patient during
the diagnostic process. In view of this, students have often shared with me their
thoughts on what they want from a textbook; it should cover the basic science
comprehensively, but with equal emphasis on relevant clinical problems. In addition,
the textbook should be user-friendly and easy-to-understand. This is of particular
importance as a well-formatted textbook can facilitate the understanding of the
material covered and thereby save the students&rsquo; time. Furthermore, students would
appreciate the provision of relevant multiple-choice questions that would reinforce
their understanding of, and ability to apply, the basic concepts, as well as honing
their examination skills.
</p>
<p>The overall objectives of this Gastrointestinal System book are to present basic
concepts and principles of normal GI physiology and, most importantly, to convey
an understanding of how to apply this knowledge to the understanding of abnormal
GI physiology in the clinical context. The ultimate goal is to let the readers have
an integrated systems-based approach in order to be able to grasp knowledge
on GI disease and its management. The understanding of basic GI concepts and
</p>

<p>viii Preface
</p>
<p>principles would be guided by scenario-based clinical case-studies, critical for
bedside care and also for preparation for professional examinations, and for being
able to deal with future developments in clinical care. In this book, the aim is
to achieve these various objectives by covering the breadth of GI system. The
contents are, therefore, designed to fall systematically into three core sections,
namely Gastrointestinal Physiology (Part I), Nutritional Physiology (Part II) and
Hepatobiliary Physiology (Part III) with closely relevant scenario-based clinical
case presentations at the end of each chapter to help students learn to apply their
growing knowledge of basic GI science, in the clinical setting. Last but by no means
least, we provide a wide range of multiple-choice questions (Part IV) so that students
can evaluate their understanding of the basic science in each area of the GI system
and to develop the students&rsquo; ability to apply their knowledge to solving clinical
problems.
</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude
to Dr. Thijs van Vlijmen, the Publishing Editor, and to Miss Sara Germans, the
Publishing Assistant of Springer, for their support and encouragement. We would
also like to express my appreciation to Leo Ka Yu Chan, Medical Student of this
University, and Sam Tsz Wai Cheng, PhD student in my Department, for technical
assistance.

<p>Prologue
</p>
<p>A major challenge facing medical students and subspecialty trainees is mastery of
basic organ system physiology and its application to understanding and treating
human disease. This is especially true of the gastrointestinal and liver system
where symptoms of disease are frequently vague and non-specific. As I tell my
medical students at the beginning of the GI lectures, &ldquo;Most of us have experienced
diarrhea, upset stomach, abdominal pain, and nausea that your patients will present
with, and your task as physicians will be to determine whether their severity
and duration warrant intervention and, if so, to identify the cause.&rdquo; In addition,
knowledge in this field continues to expand at an ever increasing rate. The ideal
textbook for this audience would combine state-of-the-art science with relevant
application to disease processes and treatment in a logical and understandable
format. This Gastrointestinal System book, edited by PS Leung and written by DD
Black, EB Chang and MD Sitrin clearly satisfies these requirements. The infor-
mative, up-to-date chapters cover all aspects of gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary
physiology and span pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of disease. Clinical
correlations using cases that clearly illustrate the concepts presented are included
in each chapter along with a reading list for more in-depth study. Multiple-choice
questions at the end of the book help the reader assess his or her understanding of
the material and identify areas for additional review. The editor and authors are all
outstanding academicians who have contributed significantly to our knowledge of
both basic physiology and clinical medicine. This book belongs in every student&rsquo;s
and trainee&rsquo;s armamentarium for mastering this fascinating area of medicine.

<p>Regulation of Gastrointestinal Functions
</p>
<p>Eugene B. Chang and Po Sing Leung
</p>
<p>1 Introduction of the Gastrointestinal System
</p>
<p>The Gastro-Intestinal (GI) system is divided into two parts: the luminal GI and
hepato-biliary-pancreatic GI.
</p>
<p>The luminal (or tubular) GI consists of the alimentary (digestive) canal or GI
tract, which extends from the mouth to the anus (Fig. 1.1). The GI tract includes the
pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum)
and large intestine (colon, cecum and rectum), as well as the anus. The GI tract is a
muscular tube of about 5 m long when one is alive; however, after a person dies and
during autopsy or postmortem examination, the length of the tract can be doubled
to 10 m. This is due to the loss of muscle tone. The GI tract can contract and relax
with different transit time in each segment of the tract, which, in turn, depends on
its own specific function (i.e. motility or secretion) of each segment. The motor
and secretory activities of the GI system are highly controlled and integrated by the
gut endocrine and enteric nervous systems (see Section on &ldquo;Neural and Hormonal
Regulators of Gastrointestinal Function&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>The hepato-biliary-pancreatic GI consists of the associated glands and
organs of the GI system; they include the salivary glands (parotid, sublingual
and submandibular glands), pancreas, gallbladder and liver which empty their
secretions into the lumen of the GI (e.g. luminal digestive enzymes). The
salivary glands secrete saliva for digestion and lubrication; the pancreas produces
hydrolytic enzymes for the digestion of our daily foodstuff and bicarbonate for

associated organs. The circled structures indicate the key locations that separate the digestive tract
from each other by the structures called &ldquo;sphincters&rdquo;
</p>
<p>the neutralization of our gastric contents; the liver secretes bile, which is stored
temporarily in the gallbladder and subsequently delivered to the duodenum for fat
digestion and absorption.
</p>
<p>There are key locations that separate the different parts of the GI tract from each
other by a structure called &ldquo;sphincter&rdquo;, e.g. esophageal (upper and lower), pyloric,
sphincter of Oddi, ileocecal, and anal sphincters (Fig. 1.1). Sphincters are made up
of smooth muscle and they act as the &ldquo;valve of a reservoir&rdquo; for holding luminal
content adequately before emptying the content into next segment by their highly
coordinated activity. Dysregulation of the activity of sphincters results in GI
motility disorders (e.g. Gastroparesis/Dumping Syndrome and Achalasia/Gastro-
Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)). As a basic concept, dysfunction of either GI
motility or secretion, or both, can lead to some common GI disorders including, but
not limiting to, GERD, Peptic ulcer Disease (PUD), and Diarrhea.
</p>
<p>1.1 General Structure of the Gastrointestinal Tract
</p>
<p>The structure of the GI tract varies greatly from region to region, but common
features exist in the overall organization of the wall of the tract (Fig. 1.2). From
inside out, there are four characteristic layers.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Regulation of Gastrointestinal Functions 5
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.2 A longitudinal section of the digestive tract wall illustrating the four major gut layers
from inside outward, i.e. mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa and serosa. GALT indicates gut-
associated lymphoid tissue (Modified from Widmaier et al. [9])
</p>
<p>The first layermucosa is the innermost layer, and it consists of an epithelium, the
lamina propria, and the muscularis mucosae. In the epithelium, it contains exocrine
gland cells and endocrine cells, which secrete mucus and digestive enzymes into the
lumen, and release GI hormones into the blood, respectively. The endocrine cells
are interspersed among the epithelial lining and they constitute the gut endocrine
system. In the lamina propria, it contains small blood vessels, nerve fibers, and
lymphatic cells/tissues, the latter being called gut-associated lymphoid tissue, as
introduced in Sect. 1.2. In addition, a thin muscle layer called muscularis mucosae
is also found and the activity of its muscle is responsible for controlling mucosal
blood flow and GI secretion.
</p>
<p>The second layer submucosa is a connective tissue with major blood and
lymphatic vessels, along with a network of nerve cells, called the submucosal nerve
plexus, passing through.
</p>
<p>The third layer muscularis externa is a thick muscle and its contraction
contributes to major gut motility (segmentation and peristalsis). This muscle layer
typically consists of two substantial layers of smooth muscle cells: an inner circular
layer and an outer longitudinal layer. A prominent network of nerve cells, called</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>the myenteric nerve plexus, is also located between the circular and longitudinal
smooth muscle layers. The myenteric nerve plexus and the submucosal plexus
constitute the enteric nervous system (ENS).
</p>
<p>The fourth layer serosa is the outermost layer, which mainly consists of
connective tissues and it connects to the abdominal wall, thus supporting the GI
tract in the abdominal cavity.
</p>
<p>1.2 Functions of the Gastrointestinal System
</p>
<p>The function of the GI system can be described in terms of four physiological
processes: (1) Digestion, (2) Secretion, (3) Absorption and (4) Motility, and
the mechanisms by which they are controlled. While digestion, secretion, and
absorption are taking place, contractions of smooth muscles in the GI tract wall
mix the luminal contents with various secretions and move them through the tract
from proximal to distal regions, i.e. from the mouth to the anus. These contractions
are referred to as the motility of the GI tract. Physiologically, the motility and
secretion are finely tuned in order to achieve optimal digestion and absorption; it in
turn facilitates assimilation of nutrients, which is the primary role of our GI system.
Put it simply, the overall function of the GI system is to take in nutrients and to
eliminate waste. In fact, one can survive without the GI system (yet the liver is still
essential for survival) if one is fed parenterally and some vital secretions (such as
digestive enzymes, intrinsic factor and insulin) are replaced.
</p>
<p>In general, the cells lining the luminal intestinal organs are exposed to hos-
tile environments, including antigens from food and bacteria, digestive enzymes
and various solutions at variable pH levels. In view of this fact, certain non-
immunologic defense mechanisms are present to protect against these potential
hazards; they include gastric acid secretion, intestinal mucin, epithelial cell perme-
ability barrier and gut peristalsis, which are critical for maintaining the ecology of
intestinal flora. For example, abnormally high levels of bacteria in an individual
with impaired small intestinal peristalsis can lead to diarrhea and/or steatorrhea
(fecal fat excretion), a clinical condition being referred to as Intestinal Blind
Loop Syndrome. Of note, the GI tract is also an important part of the immune
system of the body. The so-called Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue or GALT
(Fig. 1.3) consists of both organized aggregates of lymphoid tissue (e.g. Peyer&rsquo;s
patches) and diffuse (or migrating) populations of immune cells (e.g. intraepithelial
lymphocytes). GALT has two primary functions: (1) protection against the
potential microbial pathogens, and (2) permission of immunologic tolerance to
both the potentially immunologic dietary substances and bacteria that normally
reside primarily in the lumen of the GI tract (called the intestinal microflora). The
GALT and intestinal microflora play critical roles in regulating GI functions, thus
having clinical relevance to gut diseases.
</p>
<p>Immunologically, GALT is a part of the Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissues
or MALT of the body, which contributes significantly to our gut defense mechanism
or GI immune system. Apart from GI tract, MALT can also be found in respiratory</p>

lymphocytes (migrating immune cells) that constitute the major components of the gut-associated
lymphoid tissue (Modified from Berne and Levy&rsquo;s Physiology, 2008)
</p>
<p>and urinary systems. Even though GALT has some interactions with the systemic
immune system, GALT is functionally and operationally distinct from the systemic
system. There is evidence of communication between the GALT and other MALT
such as the pulmonary epithelia, as manifested in asthma. The GALT system
secretes antibodies in response to specific food or bacterial antigens, and triggers
immunological reactions against them, thus finally leading to mucosal inflammation
and damage. Activation of this local GI immune system is involved in some of the
common GI disorders, including celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn&rsquo;s disease.
</p>
<p>2 Integration of Gastrointestinal System
</p>
<p>Upon the ingestion of a food bolus into the GI tract, a sequence of regulatory
mechanisms is elicited. This includes complex digestive, secretory, absorptive, and
excretory processes. Most of these events occur automatically without conscious
effort and, for the most part, they work in an integrated manner. Considering the
substantial variations in the content, volume, and timing of our daily oral intake, it
is remarkable that the gut is so accommodating and adaptable. Adequate nutrition
is finely maintained to meet our metabolic needs so that abdominal symptoms are
rarely experienced.
</p>
<p>The luxury of taking our digestive system for granted is largely due to complex
and seemingly redundant regulatory systems that make it possible to achieve great
efficiency in the digestion and absorption of what we ingest. As an example of the
highly integrated nature of gut functions, stimulation of the smooth muscles of the</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 1.4 A summary illustrating the basic neuro-hormonal mechanisms by which the gastroin-
testinal functions are regulated and integrated. There are two major body systems involved in these
regulatory pathways, namely the enteric nervous system and the gut endocrine system
</p>
<p>esophagus at different levels must be coordinated; this in turn leads to sequential
stimulation to produce the unified propulsive contractile wave front (peristalsis)
that is required for distally directing boluses of food. For food to enter the stomach,
the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which is usually closed to prevent reflux of
gastric contents back into the esophagus, must be open at the precise arrival of the
peristaltic wave. To achieve this, the gut uses intricate neural and hormonal signals
to coordinate esophageal and gastric functions and to prepare the rest of the gut for
processing of food. Occasionally, something goes awry and severe GI symptoms
can develop. This will be discussed in greater detail in the following chapter.
</p>
<p>2.1 Neural and Hormonal Regulators of Gastrointestinal
</p>
<p>Function
</p>
<p>In view of the complex and automatic nature of gut functions, it is not surprising
that the GI tract has its own endocrine system, i.e. gut endocrine system and its
local nervous system, i.e. enteric (intrinsic) nervous system (ENS) of the body.
Although its functions can be modulated by the central nervous system (CNS)
and autonomous (extrinsic) nervous system (ANS), the gut can work on its own
and independently from the CNS and ANS. This is because numerous regulatory
systems are intrinsic and &ldquo;hard-wired&rdquo;, making it possible for the gut and associated
digestive organs to produce reflexive and measured responses to luminal contents
and metabolic needs. Figure 1.4 summarizes the regulation and integration of GI
physiological processes via neural and hormonal pathways of the GI system. In
general, there are three principal control mechanisms involved in the regulation
of GI function, namely endocrine, paracrine, and neurocrine pathways, depending
on the methods by which the regulators are delivered to their target sites.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Regulation of Gastrointestinal Functions 9
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.5 Some typical examples of gut regulators that are grouped into the categories of peptides
and non-peptides
</p>
<p>2.2 Peptide Hormones
</p>
<p>The regulators of the gut is grouped into several different classes of compounds
in the form of peptides and non-peptides (Fig. 1.5). As shown, peptide hormones
such as gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide
(VIP), gastric inhibitory peptide/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP),
and motilin are recognized as extremely important regulators of the gut function.
Many other peptide hormones have recently been identified, which are released by
GI endocrine cells and influence gut functions.
</p>
<p>Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide, released from the stomach, which acts
as a regulator of food intake or appetite enhancer. Plasma levels of ghrelin
increase during fasting and fall during feeding. Interestingly, ghrelin levels are
raised in dieters who try to lose weight; this observation may explain why it is
difficult for most dieters to maintain their weight loss. In contrast, leptin, a peptide
hormone released from fat cells or GI tract, acts as a circulating satiety factor
or appetite-suppressant. Rather than regulating meal-to-meal food consumption
as ghrelin, leptin helps maintain the usual level of adiposity (fat storage) of the
body. Interestingly, leptin has been shown to affect nutrient absorption via direct
inhibition of luminal amino acid uptake by the enterocytes. Similarly, several
novel gut peptide candidates have also recently been discovered to control nutrient
absorption by the intestine; one of the good examples is angiotensin II, which is a
physiologically active peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In this context,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>locally generated angiotensin II from the enterocytes is found to inhibit sodium-
dependent glucose co-transporter-1 (SGLT-1)-mediated glucose uptake across the
small intestinal border membrane and thus it has clinical implications in diabetes.
</p>
<p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is released from the enteroendocrine L cells
in the intestine. GLP-1 is a 30-amino acid peptide of the secretin family with a
50 % sequence similarity with glucagon. The glucagon gene is composed of six
exons that produce preproglucagon. In the pancreatic &rsquo;-cells, preproglucagon is
processed to glucagon and glucagon-related polypeptide. In the intestinal L cells,
preproglucagon is processed to GLP-1, GLP-2 and glycentin. GLP-1 has a short
half-life (1&ndash;2 min) due to the rapid degradation of its N-terminus by an enzyme,
called dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). As such, inhibition of this enzyme by
a DPP-IV inhibitor (e.g. Sitagliptin or Januvia, a Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved oral hypoglycemic drug fromMerck) is beneficial as it can prolong
the action of GLP-1 in the blood. Interestingly, a naturally-occurring peptide in the
saliva of the Gila monster, called exendin-4, shares sequence similarity with GLP-
1; however, exendin-4 has a prolonged half-life because it is resistant to DPP-IV
degradation. The drug exenatide (Byetta) is a synthetic exendin-4, which is the first
GLP-1 based drug for the treatment of diabetes approved by the FDA.
</p>
<p>The GI tract is a major site for production and release of many of the peptide
hormones, some acting exclusively on GI organs while some affecting extra-
intestinal tissues, and a few having actions that are still unknown. These regulators
can be found not only in endocrine cells throughout the GI tract but also in enteric
neurons. Many of these agents are also found in the brain, leading some to believe
that the gut has a &ldquo;visceral brain&rdquo; that regulates intestinal function in response
to food or other stimuli. Abnormalities in the regulation by these agents or their
overactive responses to external stimuli, such as stress, may contribute to certain
diseases, including peptic ulcer disease, motility abnormalities, and irritable bowel
syndrome.
</p>
<p>Most peptide hormones of the gut are single peptide chains, insulin being a
notable exception. About half of the bioactive gut peptide hormones are amidated
(i.e. having an additional terminal amide or NH2 group) at the carboxyl terminal
end, a specific post-translational processing event that appears to be essential for
biological activity and stability of the peptide. Based on structural similarities,most
gut peptides can be grouped into a variety of peptide families (Fig. 1.6).
</p>
<p>Gastrin-Cholecystokinin Family
</p>
<p>In the gastrin-cholecystokinin family, there are various forms of gastrin and
cholecystokinin (CCK) arising from post-translational modifications; they share an
identical C-terminal tetra-peptide sequence (Fig. 1.7a), which is the biologically
active domain of both peptides. Not surprisingly, each peptide can bind to the
receptors of the other peptides, but with lesser affinity than to its own receptor,</p>

the gastrin family, gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) members share identical C-terminal tetra-
peptide sequences, which is the biologically active domain of the family. Members of the secretin
family have structural similarities, but to a lesser extent than the gastrin family. Boxes within lower
panel indicate amino acids that are identical to those in secretin</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>i.e. CCKA for CCK and CCKB for gastrin, thus exhibiting similarities in physio-
logical function; it is called &ldquo;Structural-Activity (Function) Relationship&rdquo; (SAR).
Other post-translational modifications, such as the sulfation of the CCK tyrosyl
residue in position 7, impart different functional and binding characteristics. For
instance, removal of this sulfate group causes the CCK peptide to have properties
more similar to gastrin.
</p>
<p>Secretin Family
</p>
<p>The secretin family merits further discussion here, as several of its members have
prominent and well-defined roles in the activation of digestive processes. Members
of this family also have structural similarities, but to a lesser extent than members
of the gastrin-CCK family (Fig. 1.7b). These members share some structural
similarities throughout the amino acid sequence that is critical for the biological
activity. As such, they have, not surprisingly, diverse and independent actions.
Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide
(VIP), for instance, each has nine amino acids that are identical to secretin, albeit in
different positions. Consequently, the known physiological actions and target tissues
of these peptides can vary significantly. For example, secretin and GIP both inhibit
gastric acid secretion and gastric emptying, but, unlike secretin, GIP has little or
no effect on pancreatic function. Unlike members of the gastrin-CCK family, most
peptides in the secretin family require the entire molecule for biological activity.
</p>
<p>Tachykinin Family
</p>
<p>The tachykinins are a family of peptides which share a number of biological actions,
especially on gut smooth muscle, and have a common C-terminal sequence Phe-
X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2, where X is a variable amino acid residue. The members of
this family include substance P, neurokinin A, neurokinin B, gastrin releasing
peptide (GRP), and bombesin (Fig. 1.6).
</p>
<p>Finally, several other types of the regulatory peptides not typically associated
with endocrine or neural tissues are worthwhile mentioning here, particularly
those of growth and trophic factors, and cytokines. Many of these agents are
synthesized locally by a variety of epithelial and mesenchymal cell types (Fig. 1.5).
Transforming growth factors-˛ andˇ (TGF-˛ and TGF-ˇ), for instance, are made
and secreted by epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa, as well as by cells in the
lamina propria. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF), on the other hand, is largely
made by lamina propria cells. Many of these agents have recently been shown to
affect mucosal functions, including barrier function, water and electrolyte transport,
and cellular growth and differentiation. Although they have prominent roles in
mediating tissue responses during injury or inflammation, these peptides probably
serve important physiological roles in maintaining mucosal functions as well.</p>

regulators. Prostaglandin and

arachidonic acid (AA)
metabolism are important
regulators of gut function.
PLA2, Phospholipase A2
</p>
<p>2.3 Non-peptide Regulators
</p>
<p>In addition to peptide hormones, many non-peptide regulatory agents are involved
in the modulation and coordination of gut functions (Fig. 1.5). Factors such as
glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (e.g. aldosterone), which
affect intestinal fluid and electrolyte absorption, are steroids made by the adrenal
gland. Vitamin D3, or 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3, is also a steroid that has significant
effects on intestinal Ca2C absorption and possibly growth and differentiation of gut
mucosa.
</p>
<p>Several non-peptide bioactive amines and neurotransmitters should also be
worthwhile mentioning. These include substances derived from single amino acid
sources, for example, epinephrine (adrenaline), dopamine, and norepinephrine
(noradrenaline), which are derived from phenylalanine and tyrosine; nitric oxide,
derived from L-arginine metabolism; and histamine from the decarboxylation of
histidine. The catecholamines within the gut are exclusively made and secreted by
enteric neurons, whereas nitric oxide is found in many different cell types, serving
as an intracellular mediator as well as a cellular signaling agent. Epinephrine
and norepinephrine, secreted by the adrenal glands and sympathetic nerves,
have numerous effects on intestinal blood flow, water and electrolyte transport,
and motility. Nitric oxide is believed to be a major non-adrenergic and non-
cholinergic (NANC) neurotransmitter important for the regulation of intestinal
motor functions and mesenteric blood flow. Histamine, which is secreted by
the gut enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, is a major regulator of gastric acid
secretion.
</p>
<p>Several regulatory substances of gut functions originate from membrane-derived
fatty acids, such as the synthesis of platelet activating factor (PAF), as illustrated
in Fig. 1.8, showing metabolites of arachidonic acid. These agents are made by</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>14 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>virtually all cell types and have been recognized as being important intracellular
mediators. However, they are made and secreted in large quantities by some cells
and appear to have effects on numerous target tissues. Although they have been
more thoroughly investigated in the context of intestinal inflammation, they also
have important physiological roles in regulating gut functions such as gastric acid
secretion, mesenteric blood flow, and intestinal motility.
</p>
<p>3 Cellular Mechanisms of Gut Regulators
</p>
<p>Gut hormones and neurotransmitters stimulate intracellular processes through a
variety of mechanisms (Fig. 1.9).Hydrophobic substances such as corticosteroids
and nitric oxide rapidly permeate the plasma membrane to stimulate intracellular
receptors or targets. On the other hand, hydrophilic mediators such as peptide
hormones, purinergic agonists, bioactive amines, and acetylcholine bind to and
stimulate specific surface membrane receptors, which in turn initiate a number
of intracellular signal transduction pathways so as to mediate alterations in cell
functions or behaviors.
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.9 Cellular sites of action for regulatory agents of the gut. Hydrophobic regulators permeate
the plasmamembrane to stimulate intracellular receptor or targets. Hydrophilic mediators generally
bind to and stimulate specific surface-membrane receptors, initiating intracellular events that
mediate alterations in cell functions or behaviors</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 1.10 G protein-mediated receptor action. (a) G proteins have structural and functional
similarities, characterized by seven helical hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains and a
cytoplasmic binding site for certain G proteins. (b) When a ligand binds to the G-protein receptor,
GDP (normally occupying the guanine nucleotide binding site) rapidly exchanges for GTP,
resulting in physiochemical alterations in G-protein structure and function
</p>
<p>3.1 Types of Membrane Receptors
</p>
<p>Several types of membrane receptors are now well characterized. Among these,
the family of receptors associated with guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding
regulatory proteins or G proteins, is perhaps the most numerous. These receptors
share structural and functional similarities, typified by seven hydrophobic, helical,
membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 1.10a), and a cytoplasmic binding site for
certain G proteins. G proteins are heterotrimeric complexes formed from &rsquo;, &ldquo;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>16 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>and &rdquo; subunits. Because the &ldquo; and &rdquo; subunits are shared among G proteins, it is
the &rsquo; subunit that confers functional and binding specificity to the various types
of G proteins. Each &rsquo; subunit has an intrinsic GTPase activity at the guanine
nucleotide binding site and separates specific binding sites for the receptor and
effector proteins, such as adenylate cyclase and other hydrolases.
</p>
<p>When a ligand binds to the receptor (Fig. 1.10b), guanosine diphosphate (GDP),
normally occupying the guanine nucleotide binding site, rapidly exchanges for GTP.
This results in a series of rapid physiochemical alterations in G-protein structure and
function. The G protein immediately dissociates from the receptor and &rsquo; subunit
from the &ldquo; and &rdquo; subunits. The &rsquo; subunit and &ldquo;-&rdquo; complex appear to activate other
effector proteins of various biochemical pathways. Additionally, some G proteins
appear to directly regulate ion channels such as voltage-sensitive Ca2C channels and
inwardly rectified KC channels. When GTP is hydrolyzed by the intrinsic GTPase
activity of the &rsquo; subunit, the G protein heterotrimeric complex reforms, and becomes
ready to be activated again if further receptor ligand signals are still present. As will
be discussed below and in subsequent chapters, the cycling of certain G proteins can
be biochemically altered by bacterial toxins such as cholera and pertussis toxins.
</p>
<p>Several non-G protein-coupled receptors have also been characterized. One
group includes receptors for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor
(EGF), insulin, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which have only
one membrane-spanning domain but possess ligand-activated protein kinase
activity. For most growth and trophic factors of the gut, activated receptors have
tyrosine kinase activity, which can stimulate several other signal transduction
pathways, including phosphatidylinositolmetabolism, the arachidonic acid cascade,
and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Another class of receptors includes
those with endogenous guanylate cyclase activity, best characterized by the
receptors for atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and guanylin.
</p>
<p>Guanylin is a recently identified gut peptide that stimulates secretion of water
and electrolytes by gut epithelial cells, particularly crypt cells in which guanylin
receptors are most highly expressed. This receptor is also the target of the heat-
stable enterotoxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which stimulates increases
in mucosal cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels and causes profuse
watery diarrhea. Finally, some receptors appear to be ion channels, including the
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT3. Most of
these receptors, when activated, undergo conformational changes resulting in the
formation of membrane &ldquo;pores&rdquo; that allow the entry of different ions.
</p>
<p>3.2 Intracellular Effector Pathways
</p>
<p>Several intracellular effector pathways mediate the actions of gut hormones and
neurotransmitters. None is specific to a particular receptor. In some instances, such
as activation of growth factor receptors, several pathways may be simultaneously</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Regulation of Gastrointestinal Functions 17
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.11 Regulation of cellular cAMP levels. Adenylate cyclase activity is regulated by the &rsquo;
subunit of two G proteins, i.e. Gs and Gi. The ADP-ribosylation of the Gs&ndash;&rsquo;, stimulated by
cholera toxin, prevents the re-association of the inactive heterotrimeric Gs protein. This results
in irreversible activation of Gs&ndash;&rsquo; and adenylate cyclase activity. In contrast, ADP-ribosylation of
Gi&ndash;&rsquo;, stimulated by pertussis toxin, results in inactivation of the counter-regulatory pathway of
adenylate cyclase and shifting the balance in favor of stimulation and increased cellular cAMP
</p>
<p>stimulated. This may occur when different G proteins are coupled to a common
receptor or when the activated pathway initiates other effector mechanisms essential
for activating or amplifying requisite events of the cellular response.
</p>
<p>Adenylate Cyclase
</p>
<p>Adenylate cyclase is a membrane-bound enzyme with several isotypes. As illus-
trated in Fig. 1.11, the activity of adenylate cyclase I is regulated by the &rsquo; subunits
of two G proteins, Gs and Gi. On receptor-ligand binding, Gs-&rsquo; dissociates from
the &ldquo;-&rdquo; subunits and activates adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the formation
of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
Counter-regulatory hormones, such as somatostatin and &rsquo;2-noradrenergic ago-
nists, stimulate the dissociation of Gi-&rsquo; from the Gi-protein complex, which inhibits
adenylate cyclase activity. Thus the balance of these regulatory mechanisms of
adenylate cyclase is an important determinant of steady-state levels of cellular
cAMP. Cholera toxin stimulates the ADP-ribosylation of Gs-&rsquo;, which prevents
the re-association of the inactive heterotrimeric Gs protein. This causes irreversible
activation of Gs-&rsquo; and adenylate cyclase activity and is the mechanism by which
cholera toxin causes profuse watery diarrhea in the absence of tissue injury.</p>

<p>Fig. 1.12 The phosphatidylinositol pathway. This is a major pathway by which hormones and
neurotransmitters lead to increases in cytosolic Ca2C and activation of protein kinase C
</p>
<p>Pertussis toxin, on the other hand, stimulates ADP-ribosylation of Gi-&rsquo;, uncoupling
the Gi protein from its receptor. This results in inactivation of the counter-regulatory
pathway of adenylate cyclase, shifting the balance in favor of stimulation and
increased cellular cAMP.
</p>
<p>An increase in cAMP activates cAMP-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase
A or A-kinase), which have numerous intracellular phospho-protein targets. The
phosphorylation of these proteins initiates a series of events that ultimately leads to
alterations in cellular function or behavior, such as stimulated ion secretion, altered
motility, and changes in capillary and absorptive functions. These events will be
discussed at greater length in subsequent chapters.
</p>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol (PI) Pathway
</p>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a membrane phospholipid that
serves as an important substrate for phospholipase C, a membrane-associated
enzyme, when activated by receptor-associated G proteins. The hydrolysis of PIP2
results in the formation of two products, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and
1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) (Fig. 1.12). IP3 is a water-soluble product that freely</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Regulation of Gastrointestinal Functions 19
</p>
<p>diffuses into the cytosol and stimulates the increase of cytosolic Ca2C by releasing it
from intracellular calcium stores. This action is mediated by a specific receptor for
IP3, which regulates a membrane calcium channel for intracellular calcium stores.
</p>
<p>Characteristically, a rapid, initial-phase increase in cytosolic Ca2C is observed,
which is believed to serve as a triggering event for the second and more sustained
phase of increased Ca2C. In most cells, the second plateau phase is dependent
on the influx of extracellular Ca2C through Ca2C-activated calcium channels
in the plasma membrane. Increases in cytosolic Ca2C have numerous effects
on cell function depending on the cell type. In many cells, the increase acti-
vates a multifunctional calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, CaMK II
kinase. Calmodulin is a small, calcium-dependent regulatory protein that mediates
many of the actions of increased cellular Ca2C, including phosphorylation and
activation of myosin light chain kinase (an important step in smooth muscle
contraction), the stimulation of Ca2C-dependent ATPase (important for restoration
of resting Ca2C levels), and the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity.
</p>
<p>In contrast to IP3, DAG is lipophilic and remains associated with the plasma
membrane. It is a specific activator of protein kinase C (PKC), which is cytosoli-
cally located but translocated to and activated at the plasma membrane by DAG.
Although PKC activity is Ca2C-dependent, DAG stimulation causes a shift in
the calcium requirement such that PKC is fully active at resting cytosolic Ca2C
</p>
<p>concentrations. PKC stimulates cell-specific serine and threonine phosphorylation
of many protein substrates, which can cause alterations in cell functions, growth,
and differentiation.
</p>
<p>Guanylate Cyclases
</p>
<p>There are at least two classes of guanylate cyclase: one is an integral part of the
plasmamembrane, and the other is soluble and locatedwithin the cytosol (Fig. 1.13).
The latter is activated by a number of non-receptor-associated systems including
nitric oxide, which stimulate rapid increases in cGMP from GTP in many cells. As
will be discussed in subsequent chapters, increases in cGMP in smooth muscle cells
cause muscle relaxation. By contrast, membrane guanylate cyclases are ligand-
activated, and in most cases function as receptors themselves. G-protein coupling
with guanylate cyclase receptors is not likely. Ligand-receptor interaction activates
the guanylate cyclase activity of a family of guanylate cyclase receptors, which
includes those for atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and the gut peptide guanylin
or heat-stable enterotoxin of E. coil (STa). Among them, guanylin is a recently
discovered peptide produced by the ileum and colon, and its name is derived from its
ability to activate the enzyme guanylate cyclase. These agonists result in increases in
cGMP, smooth muscle relaxation, and stimulation of water and electrolyte secretion
in epithelial cells. These actions are mediated by cGMP-dependent protein kinases,
which phosphorylate critical membrane proteins involved in these processes.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 1.13 Regulation of cellular cGMP. There are two types of guanylate cyclases that are found
in intestinal cells, one integral with the plasma membrane and the other in the cytosol. A receptor-
mediated mechanism activates the membrane-bound guanylate cyclase (upper panel), whereas the
cytosolic guanylate cyclase, which is soluble, is stimulated by endogenous agents. e.g. nitric oxide
which is able to permeate the plasma membrane (lower panel)
</p>
<p>Tyrosine Kinases
</p>
<p>The actions of many intestinal growth factors such as EGF, PDGF and IGF
are mediated by the activation of cellular tyrosine kinase receptors. Tyrosine
kinase receptors are trans-membrane proteins that can be single polypeptides or
heterodimers. They have extracellular domains for specific ligand binding and
cytoplasmic domains that possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The activation
of the receptor often induces auto-phosphorylation of the receptor, which may
negatively feedback on its activity. There may be considerable amplification of
the initial signal by the integration of this system with other signal transduction
pathways (Fig. 1.14). Several substrates appear to be the targets of tyrosine
kinase receptors, including important regulatory proteins of other biochemical
pathways such as phospholipase C-&rdquo; and phospholipase A2. Additionally, auto-
phosphorylation of the receptor appears to be an important event since it provides
recognition and binding sites for SH2 (src homology) domain of the adaptor protein
Grb2. This in turn causes the binding of another protein, SOS, at the SH3 domain
of Grb2, required for activation of ras proto-oncogene. The latter initiates a cascade
of events that activate Raf-1 and MAP kinases, involved in regulating numerous
cellular and transcriptional processes. Details of this pathway are beyond the scope
of this discussion.</p>

<p>4 Gut Regulatory Pathways
</p>
<p>4.1 Neural Hormonal Mechanisms
</p>
<p>The regulation and integration of gut functions are mediated by a variety of
pathways, each having unique characteristics suited for specialized tasks (Fig. 1.15).
These pathways are present throughout most of the gut, although they assume more
importance in certain regions relative to others. Likewise, the regulatory agents
mediating the actions of each pathway can substantially differ. On the other hand,
it is also clear that some regulatory agents are common to several pathways, albeit
affecting different target tissues.
</p>
<p>Endocrine Pathway
</p>
<p>This represents the traditional concept of regulatory hormones secreted into
the blood stream and delivered to distant target tissues. This system has the
advantage of simultaneously affecting large numbers and regions of target tissues.
Insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells stimulated by increased blood glucose
concentration is an example of this classic endocrine pathway. Insulin has a large
systemic action, including effects on GI and hepatic metabolism, and functions.
Another example is the release of gastrin into the blood stimulated by gastric</p>

Paracrine, (c) Autocrine, (d) Juxtacrine, and (e) Neurocrine pathways
</p>
<p>contents and increased intraluminal pressure. Gastrin stimulates gastric acid and
pepsin secretion and activates gastric motility important for grinding up food and
emptying gastric chyme into the duodenum. Gastrin also promotes increased tone
of the lower esophageal sphincter to prevent reflux of gastric contents. Thus gastrin
affects several target tissues simultaneously, which function coordinately to start the
initial phase of digestion.
</p>
<p>Paracrine Pathway
</p>
<p>This represents the mode of action of numerous endocrine cells interspersed among
epithelial cells of the intestinal and gastric mucosa. These cells are morphologically
distinct, characterized by epithelial polarity, and have well-defined microvillous
membranes at the luminal surface, whereas nuclei and dense secretory granules
are located at the base of the cells. These cells are capable of sensing changes
in the chemical and osmotic conditions of the intestinal lumen, which trigger the
release of their regulatory substances stored in the basally located granules at the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Regulation of Gastrointestinal Functions 23
</p>
<p>contra-luminal membrane. Additionally, neural structures and products of other
endocrine cells may regulate the release of paracrine factors by stimulating specific
receptors on the baso-lateral surfaces of these cells. The released paracrine agents
traverse the interstitial space to adjacent target cells, altering their functions or
cellular behaviors. This mechanism of action is particularly suitable for the intestine,
as the effect is a localized, immediate, and measured response to changes in an
ambient environment. Potential systemic effects of these agents are thus avoided
and adjacent areas of the gut that may have other important and separately-regulated
functions are not affected.
</p>
<p>Autocrine Pathway
</p>
<p>This pathway is closely related to paracrine action, except that the stimulated
release of a hormone message serves to auto-regulate the functional or biological
behaviors of the cell itself. In some instances, this appears to serve as a negative
feedback mechanism to auto-regulate the hormonal secretory process. However,
these autocrine signals may also serve to auto-regulate cellular functions under
special circumstances or at certain stages of development, such as growth and
differentiation. For example, TGF-&rsquo; and TGF-&ldquo;, which are made and secreted by
intestinal epithelial cells at critical points in cellular development, may be involved
in the differentiation process of immature crypt cells to more mature villus cells.
</p>
<p>Juxtacrine Pathway
</p>
<p>This pathway is a newly-described mechanism of action of several regulatory
agents that are secreted by cells in close proximity to their target tissues within
the intestinal mucosa. This includes cells of the lamina propria, which are now
believed to be important in regulating mucosal functions such as epithelial fluid
and electrolyte transport, capillary blood flow, enteric neural stimulation, and
motility. For example, a layer of myofibroblasts underlies the intestinal epithelium.
These cells elaborate arachidonic acid metabolites, platelet activating factor (PAF),
purinergic agonists (adenosine, ATP), and other bioactive substances that modulate
the electrolyte transport function of the overlying epithelial cells. It is also believed
that these cells secrete trophic/growth factors that nurture the epithelial cells
and play a role in their development to mature epithelial cells. Cells using this
pathway are distinct from paracrine cells in that they are not typical endocrine
cells, can exhibit considerable motility (e.g. immune cells of the lamina propria),
and can affect numerous target tissues. Apart from playing a role in regulating
physiological processes of the guts, many of these cells also have a prominent role
in the intestinal responses to injury and inflammation (e.g. against pathogen invasion
of the intestinal mucosa).</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 1.16 Some typical examples of neuroregulators of the gut. These regulators are divided into
peptides and bioactive non-peptide substances
</p>
<p>Neurocrine Pathway
</p>
<p>This pathway is involved in regulatory agents that are made and released from
enteric neurons and function as typical neurotransmitters; that is, after release
from terminal axons they traverse a narrow &ldquo;synaptic space&rdquo; and stimulate specific
receptors of the target tissue. This form of regulation is quite specific in that the
delivery of the neurotransmitters precisely and rapidly affects a designated target
cell. On the other hand, the neural regulation of intestinal function can be quite
extensive, as neurons are organized into intricate complexes capable of producing
rapid and faithful patterns of stimulation that simultaneously affect numerous
structures to coordinately regulate their functions. These patterns are hard-wired,
reflexive responses involved in physiological functions such as swallowing, gastric
emptying, and defecation, as well as coordination of secretory, motor, and capillary
functions. Integrated neural responses to physiological stimuli will occur repeti-
tively and proportionately to the intensity of the afferent stimulus. A variety of target
cells of motor neurons is known, including epithelial, muscle, endothelial, and other
mesenchymal cells.
</p>
<p>4.2 Organization of Enteric Neurons
</p>
<p>Neurotransmitters Involved
</p>
<p>The neurotransmitters involved in neurocrine regulation of the gut can be divided
into peptides and bioactive non-peptide substances (Fig. 1.16). Non-peptide
agents include serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), nitric oxide, purinergic
agonists, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine; whereas for gut neuropeptides, numer-
ous have now been identified. In fact, many were originally identified as neurotrans-
mitters of the brain, but some, such as cholecystokinin (CCK) and somatostatin, are
also found in endocrine cells of the gut. Neuropeptides are largely concentrated in
the intrinsic nerves of the gut.</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Regulation of Gastrointestinal Functions 25
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.17 Organization of the enteric nervous system. Enteric neurons have their own sensory
neurons, interneurons and motor neurons which are capable of producing motor and secretory
responses upon luminal stimuli. These responses can be modified by input from autonomic nerves
from the central nervous system. (Modified from Chang EB, Binder HJ. Diarrheal diseases.

</p>
<p>Enteric Nervous System
</p>
<p>The intrinsic or enteric nervous system is composed of afferent (sensory) neurons,
interneurons, and efferent (motor) neurons, whose cell bodies are located within
the bowel wall. Enteric neurons are quite numerous and well organized. As shown
in Fig. 1.17, enteric nerves are organized into hard-wired circuits that produce
characteristic and rapid patterns of response. Interneurons, nerves that connect
and integrate afferent signals to efferent motor neurons, play an important role
in integrating the neural response, receiving inputs from sensory neurons and
activating several neural targets of intestinal plexuses. Their functions can be
modified by inputs from autonomic nerves from the central nervous system. But
still, the interneurons are also quite capable of functioning independently despite
loss of autonomic neural input.
</p>
<p>Sympathetic Innervation
</p>
<p>The gut receives extensive innervation by sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons.
Most sympathetic fibers of the gut are postganglionic. Efferent sympathetic
fibers to the stomach originate from the celiac plexus, whereas those to the
small intestine originate from the celiac and the superior mesenteric plexuses.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>26 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>Fibers to the cecum, appendix, ascending colon, and transverse colon arise
from the superior mesenteric plexus. The remaining portion of the colon
receives sympathetic fibers from the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses.
Sympathetic neurons to the gut have a variety of functions. Some regulate
inter-glandular tissues or closely approximate intestinal mucosa by regulating
transport functions of these cells. Sympathetic neurons also innervate smooth
muscle cells of blood vessels, thereby regulating blood flow to the intestine,
and neuronal cells of the intramural plexus, specifically inhibitory receptors
of presynaptic regions of enteric neurons. Stimulation of &rsquo;2-noradrenergic
presynaptic receptors inhibits the release of acetylcholine and serotonin,
representing one mechanism by which sympathetic fibers are counter-regulatory
to parasympathetic and serotoninergic stimulation. In other regions of the gut,
sympathetic fibers play a role in regulating sphincter function, such as the lower
esophageal and anal sphincters where sympathetic stimulation appears to be
excitatory.
</p>
<p>Parasympathetic Innervation
</p>
<p>Parasympathetic innervation to the stomach, small intestine, and proximal colon
arises from the vagus nerve, with its fibers running along blood vessels and
ending in the myenteric plexus. The rest of the colon receives parasympathetic
innervation from the pelvic nerves of the hypogastric plexus, which also end in
the myenteric plexus. All parasympathetic fibers are preganglionic and most are
cholinergic and excitatory. However, other neurotransmitters, such as substance
P, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and enkephalin-like compounds, are also
made and released by parasympathetic neurons. For example, VIP released from
parasympathetic nerve endings causes relaxation of the lower esophageal, pyloric,
and internal anal sphincters.
</p>
<p>The efferent response of vagal fibers requires a continuous exchange of
information between the gut and brain. This is mediated by afferent vagal fibers
that connect with neurons of the hypothalamus, globus pallidus, and the limbic
systems. In this way, regulation of intestinal functions can be modulated by inputs
from the central nervous system. For example, signals from stretch receptors and
chemoreceptors of the stomach and alterations in metabolic conditions, such as
glucosideapenia (low glucose content inside cells), when perceived by the brain,
prompt an immediate efferent response to stimulate gastric acid secretion and
motility.
</p>
<p>4.3 Determinants for the Integration of Gut Functions
</p>
<p>You may wonder: why does the gut have such intricate and seemingly redundant
regulation systems? Given the complexity and the number of regional and temporal</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Regulation of Gastrointestinal Functions 27
</p>
<p>Fig. 1.18 Region-specific distribution of mucosal endocrine cells. The gut endocrine cells are not
randomly but regionally specific distributed in the gut
</p>
<p>events that must be coordinated for digestive and absorptive functions to proceed
autonomously and efficiently, such regulation systems are necessary. Different
levels of organization are utilized, as indicated in the examples that follow.
</p>
<p>4.4 Regional Distribution of Mucosal Endocrine Cells
</p>
<p>Most mucosal endocrine cells are distributed in a region-specific way (Fig. 1.18).
This actually makes teleological sense, as the physiological roles of many gut
peptides depend on their regional presence, either to produce a rapid, appropriate,
and measured stimulation of their release or to regulate regional tissue responses.
This basic principle can be illustrated by the predominant expression of the peptides
gastrin, CCK, GIP, and secretin in the stomach and upper intestinal tract (Fig. 1.19).
The entry of a food bolus into the stomach stimulates gastrin release from the antral
G cells (mucosal endocrine cells located in the distal one-third of the stomach) into
the blood. Through a classical endocrine effect, gastrin initiates gastric motility,
increases the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter, and stimulates gastric acid
secretion. As the gastric chyme enters the duodenum, mucosal endocrine cells
are stimulated to release GIP, CCK, and secretin, which activate enteric neural
pathways and/or stimulate via an endocrine mechanism. Pancreatic and biliary
secretions begin the next phase of food digestion. In addition, these hormones
provide feedback inhibition of gastric motility and acid secretion. As will be</p>

</p>
<p>discussed in the subsequent chapters, precise regulation of the timing of these events
and the degree of tissue response are critical for preventingmaldigestion of food and
development of abnormal symptoms.
</p>
<p>4.5 Systemic Integration of Associated Gut Functions
</p>
<p>Upon the reception of physiological stimuli, the response of tissues and organs to
the stimuli is regulated by the regulatory systems of the gut. This is achieved through
the simultaneous and coordinated activation of several key co-dependent processes.
As an example, neural regulation of any regions of the gut integrates the processes
of intestinal water and electrolyte transport, motility, and blood flow. Neurocrine
regulation of the small intestine is initiated by chemoreceptors and mechanical
stretch receptors (Fig. 1.20). Afferent neurons stimulate interneurons of intestinal
neural plexuses to activate several efferent motor pathways. Some neurons directly
stimulate intestinal epithelial cells to secrete water and electrolytes into the lumen,
necessary for providing the aqueous phase and proper chemical composition for
luminal digestion and absorption. Concomitantly, motor neurons are activated
to stimulate segmental contractions of the small intestine, for mixing intestinal
contents with digestive juices. Finally, motor neurons stimulate alterations in
mesenteric and splanchnic blood flow necessary for absorption of nutrients and their
delivery to the liver.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 1.20 Enteric regulation of gut functions. Neuroregulation of the gut integrates the processes
of intestinal water and electrolyte transport, motility and blood flow in response to food stimuli.
Luminal pressure and chemical signals activate chemo- and mechano-receptors of the sensing
afferent enteric neurons and thus stimulate a response such as simultaneous alterations in motor,
capillary and mucosal functions
</p>
<p>4.6 Integration of Regulatory Systems of the Gut
</p>
<p>Considerable &ldquo;cross-talk&rdquo; is essential between regulatory systems of the gut to
prevent counterproductive and inefficient actions. An example of this is the relation-
ship between juxtacrine and neurocrine cells of the intestinal mucosa (Fig. 1.21).
Under physiological and pathophysiological situations, juxtacrine cells of the
lamina propria (e.g. sub-epithelial myofibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells) are
stimulated to secrete a variety of bioactive substances, including arachidonic acid
metabolites. These agents can directly stimulate intestinal epithelial, endothelial,
and smooth muscle cells. However, their effects are further amplified by activation
of secreto-motor enteric neurons, which potentiate the actions of the mediators at
the target tissues. Thus, the intensity and regional effects of juxtacrine agents can be
significantly enhanced.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; The gastrointestinal (GI) system is massive in size compared to all other organ
systems; it consists of esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine,
gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. In view of this, complex control mechanisms
are needed to integrate these seven organs together into a functional correlate.
</p>
<p>&bull; The major functions of the GI system are secretion, motility, digestion,
absorption, metabolism, and defense mechanisms, as well as serving immunity.</p>

effects of prostaglandins on secretory function that can be amplified by secretomotor enteric
neurons
</p>
<p>&bull; The GI function is regulated by the extrinsic, intrinsic, and hormonal mech-
anisms via endocrine, paracrine and neurocrine pathways. Each regulatory
mechanism does not occur as an isolated event but are all integrated into one
control mechanism. For example, extrinsic nerves alter hormone release, which
are in turn affected by paracrine agents. One representative example is typified by
the control of gastric acid secretion, where extrinsic nerves, local enteric reflexes,
paracrines, and hormones act in a highly integrated manner.
</p>
<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>A 50-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of severe watery diarrhea and
dehydration. The diarrhea is characterized by intermittent loose stools or watery
diarrhea and occasional flushing. As his symptoms become worse, his family doctor
prescribes himwith antibiotics and several antidiarrhealmedications, but to no avail.
</p>
<p>He is admitted to the hospital when found to be orthostatic by blood pressure and
pulse (i.e. blood pressure falls and pulse increases, indicative of severe dehydration),
hypokalemic (low serum KC), and hypochloremic (low serum Cl�). His serum
electrolyte abnormalities are corrected by intravenous replacement, but his diarrhea
persists in spite of fasting for 48 h. Stool output over a 24-h period averages 1&ndash;1.5 L.
Stool examination reveals no blood, pathogens, leukocytes, or fat. Diagnostic
studies, including endoscopy and barium studies of the bowel, are unrevealing.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Regulation of Gastrointestinal Functions 31
</p>
<p>A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the abdomen, however, shows a
pancreatic mass and numerous lesions in the liver, consistent with tumor metastases.
Plasma VIP levels are markedly elevated.
</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. What does this patient have?
Answer: This patient has a rare endocrine tumor originating from the pan-
creas called a VIPoma. It is a functional endocrine tumor that makes and
secretes large amounts of gut peptides; they include VIP (vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide), motilin, and neurotensin. Because these tumors are generally
slow growing, patients can tolerate them for years before they become clinically
manifested.
</p>
<p>2. What is the pathophysiological basis of the clinical symptoms?
Answer: VIP is an important gut peptide typically found in neuroendocrine cells
(but also expressed in some enteric neurons) that regulates numerous intestinal
functions including motility, intestinal water and electrolyte transport, and blood
flow. Because this tumor produces abnormal blood hormone levels, agents like
VIP, in particular, can have significant systemic effects. VIP causes vasodilation
that is manifested by facial flushing and sometimes hypotension. It is also one
of the most potent secretagogues (i.e. stimulants that cause net secretion of
water and electrolytes) of the gut; this action is mediated by stimulation of
adenylate cyclase and increased cAMP. VIP-induced diarrhea persists despite
fasting, a clinical feature of secretory (opposed to &ldquo;osmotic&rdquo;) diarrheal diseases.
Hypokalemia occurs because of stool losses and the chronic effects of aldos-
terone, a mineralocorticoid that is secreted by the adrenal gland in response to
hypovolemia (decreased blood volume). Aldosterone increases renal reabsorp-
tion of NaC at the expense of increased excretion of KC. Hypochloremia may
be a consequence of increased stool Cl� losses.
</p>
<p>3. How would you treat this patient&rsquo;s diarrhea?
Answer: Because this tumor has already spread, surgical intervention is not
feasible. However, treating the patient with the long-acting somatostatin analog,
Octreotide, can inhibit the effects of the tumor. Octreotide has minor direct
effects on intestinal mucosa cells that promote net absorption, probably mediated
by activation of the inhibitory G-protein, Gi (thereby inhibiting VIP-stimulated
adenylate cyclase activity). Octreotide&rsquo;s major effect appears to be the inhibition
of hormone release (and possibly synthesis) by tumor cells. This is evidenced by
plasma levels of the peptides, VIP and neurotensin, returning to normal following
the administration of Octreotide, which is accompanied by a marked and rapid
reduction of daily stool output to normal (&lt;200 gm/day).
</p>
<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>A 30-year-old woman has increasing symptoms of abdominal bloating, weight loss,
and diarrhea. The latter is characterized as foul smelling and bulky (typical of fat in
the stool, or steatorrhea). Although the pancreas appears to be anatomically normal,
exocrine pancreatic functions are abnormal, i.e. decreased secretion of pancreatic</p>

</div>

<p>32 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>enzymes and bicarbonate. Her gallbladder also empties poorly after meals. Fecal fat
levels are very high, consistent with fat maldigestion and malabsorption. A small
bowel biopsy shows villus atrophy, inflammation, and crypt cell hypertrophy.
</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. What does this patient have?
Answer: This patient has Celiac disease (Celiac sprue), an inflammatory con-
dition (enteropathy) of the small intestinal mucosa triggered by dietary exposure
to gluten. Gluten is a water-insoluble protein moiety of cereal grains (primarily
wheat) that stimulates an inflammatory or immune response in individuals who
are genetically susceptible. The condition is characterized by the development
of small intestinal mucosal inflammation, most severe in the duodenum and
proximal jejunum. The histology shown above is typical of Celiac disease,
showing villus atrophy (shortening or absence of villi), crypt hypertrophy, and a
lamina propria packed with immune and inflammatory cells. As an aside, Celiac
disease is a common disorder that likely has a genetic basis, but is often clinically
silent. It is a relatively &ldquo;new&rdquo; disease, as humans only started eating wheat about
10,000 years ago.
</p>
<p>2. What is the pathophysiological basis of the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and
abnormal gut functions?
</p>
<p>Answer: As mentioned above, the duodenum is severely affected by Celiac
disease. Many of the mucosal endocrine cells that regulate the early digestive
phases of intestinal function are located in this region, including those that
secrete CCK, GIP, and secretin.Compromised secretion of these gut peptides,
after gastric chyme enters the duodenum, impairs pancreatic function because
CCK and secretin are required for activating pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate
secretion, respectively. Similarly, gallbladder contraction is dependent on the
release of CCK. Compromised pancreatic and biliary secretions prevent
proper digestion of food. Injured and inflamed small bowel mucosa impairs
proper absorption of nutrients, water, and electrolytes. Net secretion of water
and electrolytes occurs because inflammation stimulates active mucosal secretion
and crypts cells are hypertrophied (crypt cells are secretory cells). As a result,
the patient develops maldigestion, malabsorption, steatorrhea, weight loss, and
abdominal bloating.
</p>
<p>3. How would you treat this patient?
Answer: By going on a gluten-free diet (e.g. no more wheat-based bread or
pasta), the patient should experience gradual improvement and weight gain.
Pancreatic and digestive functions should also return to normal. Glucocorticoid
treatment is recommended if deemed to do so; glucocorticoid is a potent drug
with anti-inflammation and immunosuppression.
</p>
<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A medical student traveling through South America develops acute, severe watery
diarrhea without fever or chills. Stool examination shows no blood, leukocytes, or
fat. However, stool cultures are positive for the pathogenic bacteria, enterotoxigenic
E. coli.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>1 Regulation of Gastrointestinal Functions 33
</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. How does this bacteria cause diarrhea in the student?
Answer: This strain of enterotoxigenicE. coli makes an enterotoxin called heat-
stable enterotoxin (STa) that binds to the guanylin receptor on the luminal
surface of intestinal epithelial cells. Guanylin is a gut peptide made by gut
mucosal endocrine cells that stimulates net water and electrolyte secretion by
a paracrine pathway. The guanylin receptor is a membrane guanylate cyclase
that is also activated by binding with STa. Resulting increases in cellular cGMP
stimulate cGMP-dependent protein kinases, setting off a cascade of biochemical
events that ultimately leads to increased mucosal secretion while inhibiting
absorption. Also compare with the mechanism of cholera-induced diarrhea
(Chap. 5).
</p>
<p>2. What do you expect from an intestinal mucosal biopsy of this student?
Answer: It would be entirely normal (i.e. intact villus architecture). E. coli STa
causes a functional impairment; however, the organism is not invasive and does
not cause an inflammatory reaction.
</p>
<p>3. How would you treat this student?
Answer: You do not need any specific treatment and oral rehydration solution
is sufficiently enough in most cases, as the disease is self-limiting in this sort
of patients. However, antibiotics taken immediately after the development of
symptoms can shorten the duration of illness. In the chapter on &ldquo;Intestinal
Physiology&rdquo;, you will learn why cholera is more severe and how oral rehydration
solutions work.

<p>1 Introduction to Gut Musculature and Neural Innervations
</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal (GI) motility is an essential function of digestive and absorptive
processes of the gut, required for propelling intestinal contents, mixing them with
digestive juices, and preparing unabsorbed particles for excretion. Pivotal to the
discussion of mechanisms for producing defined patterns of motor responses are
important and intimately related aspects of intestinal neurophysiology and motor
regulation.Many principles presented in this section are intentionally oversimplified
to provide a better conceptual framework for understanding both normal physiology
and the pathophysiological mechanisms of various intestinal diseases arising from
aberrations in intestinal motility and neurophysiology.
</p>
<p>1.1 Gut Smooth Muscle and Its Organization
</p>
<p>With the exception of the upper one third of the esophagus and the external
anal sphincter, the muscular layers of the bowel wall are made up of smooth
muscle cells. Like striated muscles, smooth muscle contractions of mammalian
small intestine are preceded by changes in membrane potential differences.
Depolarization of the membrane tends to cause the muscle cell to contract, whereas

<p>Fig. 2.1 Transverse section
of intestinal smooth muscles.
Gap junctions (arrows) are
points of low electrical
resistance between cells.
They allow depolarizing
signals to be instantaneously
propagated to a large number
of cells (Photomicrograph
kindly provided by Dr.
Giorgio Gabella)
</p>
<p>hyperpolarization has the opposite effect. However, in contrast to skeletal muscles,
smooth muscle cells have no striations because they lack well organized arrays of
sarcomeres, are smaller, and are organized into discrete muscle bundles surrounded
by connective tissue. Each bundle functions as a single unit; all its smooth muscle
cells contract simultaneously to produce an efficient motor response. This is possible
because of gap junctions, or points of low electrical resistance between cells
(Fig. 2.1), through which a depolarizing signal can be instantaneously transmitted
to all cells. This also makes unnecessary the neural activation of each individual
cell, as each muscle bundle unit could potentially be regulated by a single neuron.
In most instances, as will be later evident, each muscle bundle receives several types
of neural input that are necessary to coordinate their activities with other motor and
intestinal processes.
</p>
<p>Most smooth muscles of the GI tract are organized into two layers that make
up the muscular sheath of the intestinal wall. Cells of the inner circular muscle
layer are circumferentially organized so that each level of the gut muscle fibers
simultaneously contracts to produce an annular contraction. The circular muscle
layer can be further subdivided into two lamellae, one thick, outer layer and
another thin, inner layer. These layers differ electrophysiologically and in the
neural innervations they receive: the inner lamella receives a greater proportion
of fibers from the submucosal plexus, while the outer is predominantly innervated
by the myenteric plexus (see below). Muscles of the outer lamella are also larger,
less electron-dense, and have more gap junctions. Thus the two lamellae of the
circular muscle layer are believed to have different functional responses; however,
understanding of this area remains incomplete.
</p>
<p>Longitudinal muscles of the gut are oriented such that their axis runs along
the length of the bowel. With the exception of the colon where they are organized
into separate thick cords (teniae coli), the longitudinal muscles form a continuous
outer muscle sheet encircling the bowel wall. Contraction and relaxation of the
longitudinal muscle layer cause alterations in the length of the bowel, important
for complex motor functions such as peristalsis (see Sect. &ldquo;3.2&rdquo; below).</p>

</p>
<p>1.2 Innervation of Gut Muscle
</p>
<p>The gut receives extrinsic sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation, but it
also has its own enteric nervous system capable of independent function in many
instances. As shown in Fig. 2.2a, preganglionic parasympathetic motor neurons
reach the gut either via the vagus nerve or the pelvic nerve, the latter supplying</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>38 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>efferent fibers to the distal colon and rectum. Parasympathetic fibers mainly
synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic or other enteric neurons located in the
intestinal wall plexuses. In contrast, preganglionic efferent fibers emanate from
the spinal cord and synapse at paravertebral ganglia, from which postganglionic
fibers project to the intestine, following the celiac, superior mesenteric and interior
mesenteric arteries in their respective distributions.
</p>
<p>Intrinsic enteric neurons are predominantly found within two major gut
plexuses (Fig. 2.2b). The myenteric or Auerbach&rsquo;s plexus, located between the
circular and longitudinal muscle layers, is a thin layer array of ganglia, ganglion
cells, and inter-ganglionic nerve tracts that serve to interconnect the plexus. Enteric
neurons of this plexus largely innervate longitudinal muscles and the outer lamella
of the circular muscle layer. A large number of peptides and nonpeptide neuro-
transmitters are expressed by myenteric plexus neurons. These include vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP), nitric oxide, peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), substance
P, and neurokinin A (NKA), to name a few. Many of these neurons have projections
into adjacentmuscle layers, where they are either excitatory or inhibitory, but some
are interneurons involved in integrative functions. The submucosal or Meissner&rsquo;s
plexus is the other neuronal array found between the submucosal layers and circular
muscle. This plexus has neurons that are functionally distinct from those of the
myenteric plexus and, relative to intestinal motor function, appear to be projecting
mainly to the inner lamella of the circular muscle layer.
</p>
<p>Enteric neurons have been extensively studied and found to be extremely diverse
and complex. At least three criteria have been used to classify enteric neurons, i.e.
morphology (Dogiel type I, II and III), electrophysiological properties (S and AH
neurons), and type of neurotransmitters they express. Because these classifica-
tions have been extensively discussed by numerous recent reviews, the following
discussion will mostly focus on distinction of enteric neurons by the content
of neurotransmitters. This provides some functional connotations meaningful for
understanding their role in regulating gut motility. However, basic principles of
smooth muscle electrophysiology should be reviewed first.
</p>
<p>2 Smooth Muscle Electrophysiology
</p>
<p>2.1 Myogenic Control System
</p>
<p>Slow Waves and Spike Potentials
</p>
<p>Two types of electrical activity are found in gut smooth muscle cells; they are
slow waves which contribute to the basic electrical rhythm and spike potentials.
Except for the esophagus and proximal stomach, most parts of the bowel have
a spontaneous rhythmical fluctuation in resting membrane potential or slow
waves, generally between �60 and �65 mV. This fluctuation represents an interval
of cyclic depolarization followed by repolarization and is called the basic electrical</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2 Gastrointestinal Motility 39
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.3 Basic electrical rhythm or BER. The BER is a rhythmical fluctuation in resting membrane
potential, characterized by intervals of cyclic depolarization followed by repolarization. BERs arise
from specialized pacemaker cells. Depolarization phases are not always accompanied by muscular
contraction. Inserts illustrate ion fluxes that are involved in depolarizing phases
</p>
<p>rhythm (BER). The frequency of BER oscillations varies from one part of the
bowel to another (Fig. 2.3), and depolarization is not necessarily accompanied by
muscular contractions.
</p>
<p>The origin of the BER appears to be specialized &ldquo;pacemaker&rdquo; cells (interstitial
cells of Cajal). These stellate, muscle-like cells interconnect, have projections to
muscle cells, and receive neural fibers from nearby myenteric plexuses. In the
stomach and small intestine, they are located at the inner circular muscle layer,
near the myenteric plexus. In the colon, dominant pacemaker cells appear to be
located in the submucosal border of the circular muscle layer. As in the conduction
system of the heart, dominant pacemakers, i.e. ones having greater cyclic frequency,
capture and entrain subsidiary pacemakers. Thus, in any region of the gut, the
electrical characteristics of the dominant regional pacemaker will be not only rapidly
propagated circumferentially but also transmitted orad and aborad. However, a
descending gradient of pacemaker frequency is known to exist in most regions
of the gut, with the possible exception of the colon. Thus, when propagation of
a pacemaker BER along the long axis of the gut weakens, more distal subsidiary
pacemakers will assume the pacemaker role. Studies have suggested that an aboral
ascending gradient may be present in the colon. As will be discussed below, this
hierarchical arrangement in BER frequency in various regions of the gut may have
important functional significance.
</p>
<p>Generation of Slow Waves
</p>
<p>Because of the tight circumferential electrical coupling of smooth muscle cells,
the BER propagation is extremely rapid and can also be measured in adjacent
muscle cells in any given gut segment. The mechanism for generation of the
BER is believed to be the consequence of a balance between the depolarizing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>40 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.4 Relationship between BER and smooth muscle contraction. The likelihood and magni-
tude of smooth muscle contractions depend on the number of rapid changes in membrane potential
(spike potentials) which are superimposed on the depolarizing phase of the BER
</p>
<p>inward flux of calcium through dihydropyridine-insensitive Ca2C channels and
the repolarizing efflux of KC from the cell through Ca2C-activated KC channels
(Fig. 2.3, insert). The cycle begins with the slow buildup of Ca2C ions in the
cell (a depolarizing process) that progressively inactivates further Ca2C influx
and simultaneously activates Ca2C-activated KC channels, leading to KC efflux
(a repolarizing process).
</p>
<p>Although depolarizations of the BER in stomach and colon can occasionally
lead to small motor contractions, most contractions occur after rapid changes in
membrane potential differences called spike potentials, which are superimposed
on the depolarizing phase of the BER (Fig. 2.4). These &ldquo;action potentials&rdquo; are
quite different from those seen in mammalian nerve or striated muscle. Their
depolarizing phase is caused by the activation of Ca2C-dependent KC channels or
increased activity of nonselective cation or Cl� channels. This is often initiated by
stimulation of cells with excitatory ligands. The resulting influx of KC depolarizes
the cells, causing an activation of voltage dependent Ca2C channels. However, this
is only one component contributing to the observed increases in cytosolic Ca2C
</p>
<p>necessary for producing muscular contraction. In circular muscle cells, the other
component involves inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)-stimulated Ca2C release
from intracellular stores, with IP3 generated from ligand-stimulated hydrolysis of
membrane phosphatidylinositol. In longitudinal muscle cells, IP3 appears to have
little role in activating increases in [Ca2C]i. Little IP3 is generated after ligand
stimulation, and addition of IP3 to permeabilized cells has little effect in releasing
Ca2C, consistent with the lack of IP3 receptors regulating internal calcium pools. In
these cells, excitatory ligands appear to activate Cl� channels, depolarizing the cells
and stimulating the opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2C channels. However, the end</p>

<p>result in both circular and longitudinal muscles may be the same. Initial increases
in cytosolic calcium augment additional and more sustained increases through the
activation of plasma membrane or sarcoplasmic Ca2C channels.
</p>
<p>Stimulated increases in Ca2C are required for electromechanical coupling. This
explains why not all phases of smooth muscle BER are associated with contraction.
Even at the peak of membrane depolarization, if the threshold potential for
initiating these events is not achieved, contraction will not occur. Spike potentials
superimposed on phasic BER depolarization increase the probability that the
threshold potential will be reached (Fig. 2.5). The appearance and frequency of
spike potentials are greatly affected by hormonal agents and neurotransmitters.
The greater the number of spike potentials per BER cycle, the greater is the
degree of muscular contraction. Epinephrine, for example, markedly decreases
spike potentials and inhibits contraction, whereas acetylcholine stimulates them and
promotes contraction. The major function of the BER, therefore, is to dictate when
contractions can occur in a certain area in the bowel. Its basic rhythm does not
appear to be affected by hormones and neurotransmitters. If there are no spike
potentials, contractions will generally not occur. On the other hand, if an agent
promotes numerous spike potentials, the frequency of muscular contractions cannot
exceed that of the BER.

Protein kinase C, activated through the generation of diacylglycerol, also appears
to have a role, especially in maintaining the duration of contraction.
</p>
<p>Relaxation of Smooth Muscles
</p>
<p>Relaxation of smooth muscles involves restoration of basal Ca2C levels,
decreased MLC kinase activity, and commensurate increase in MLC
phosphatase action. Several mechanisms appear to be involved in decreasing
cytosolic Ca2C, including the activation of Ca2C-ATPase to pump Ca2C out of the
cells or back into internal Ca2C stores. In addition, repolarization of the plasma
membrane inhibits further entry of Ca2C via voltage-activated calcium channels.
MLC phosphatase causes the dephosphorylatioin of myosin, with cessation of the
actin-myosin interaction.</p>

</p>
<p>3 Neural and Hormonal Regulation of Gut Motility
</p>
<p>3.1 Neurohumoral Regulators
</p>
<p>Gut motility is regulated by the balance of effects received from excitatory
and inhibitory regulatory agents. These agents can regulate motor functions in
several different ways (Fig. 2.7). Some neurotransmitters and hormones have direct
effects on smooth muscle, including agents such as acetylcholine, epinephrine,
norepinephrine, tachykinins (such as substance P), and opioid peptides such as
enkephalins and dynorphins.
</p>
<p>Inhibitory Agents
</p>
<p>Inhibitory agents generally work by stimulating increases in cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), sec-
ondary messengers that appear to counteract the effects of increased cytolic Ca2C
</p>
<p>in several ways. For example, the stimulation of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent
protein kinases have been shown to inhibit IP3 formation and its effects on Ca2C
</p>
<p>release from internal calcium stores. These kinases may also stimulate mechanisms
involved in the re-uptake or lowering of cytosolic calcium, including stimulation
of Ca2C-ATPase of plasma membrane or cellular organelles. As a third mechanism,
</p>

intestinal motor function.
Agents involved in the
regulation of intestinal motor
function may be excitatory
(upper panel) or inhibitory
(lower panel). The mode of
action of each representative
agent is shown on the right
side of each box</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>44 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>increases in cyclic nucleotides may play a role in stimulatory mechanism, such as
Ca2C-dependent KC channels, which repolarize the cell and inhibit the actions of
excitatory stimuli. Inhibitory agents that stimulate increases in smooth muscle cell
cAMP include vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), glucagon, and peptide histidine
isoleucine (PHI) or peptide leucine methionine (PHM), in humans. Nitric oxide
is inhibitory because it stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase and increased cellular
cGMP levels.
</p>
<p>Excitatory Agents
</p>
<p>Most excitatory agents of intestinal motility work by stimulating increases in
cytosolic Ca2C and/or inhibiting the formation of cyclic nucleotides. For instance,
acetylcholine&rsquo;s excitatory actions are mediated by muscarinic receptor-stimulated
increases in cytosolic Ca2C. Other agents such as �- and ı-opioid receptor
agonists also inhibit adenylate cyclase activity, in addition to stimulating increases
in cytosolic Ca2C. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), on the other hand,
simultaneously stimulates increases in cytosolic Ca2C through 5-HT2 receptors
and increases in adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP via stimulation of 5-HT4
receptors. These seemingly counterproductive actions probably serve as a form of
cellular feedback regulation.
</p>
<p>Other Regulatory Agents
</p>
<p>Other regulatory agents of intestinal motility act indirectly, either by stimulating
or inhibiting the release of other neuropeptides or hormones. As an example
of this modulatory role, cholecystokinin (CCK) and bombesin stimulate intestinal
motility by enhancing the release of excitatory peptides such as acetylcholine and
substance P. By contrast, neuropeptide Y and somatostatin inhibit the release of
these agents. As another layer of complexity, agents such as somatostatin can
further inhibit motility by inhibiting the release of opioid peptides that normally
would inhibit VIP release of nitric oxide production. The net effect, therefore, is
decreased inhibitory tone on release of VIP secretion, causing inhibition of motility.
</p>
<p>3.2 Types of Gut Motility
</p>
<p>Digestive and absorptive functions of the gut are very much dependent on cer-
tain characteristic patterns of motility which is present in various parts of the
bowel. Each serves important functional roles, including mixing, propulsion, and
separation of luminal contents. These actions are possible because of the coordi-
nated interaction of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. As schematically shown in
Fig. 2.8, stimulation of intramural baroreceptors by the presence luminal contents</p>

function for the digestion and processing of luminal contents
</p>
<p>simultaneously activates proximal excitatory neurons that stimulate contraction and
inhibitory neurons in adjacent segments that induce receptive relaxation. Thus, the
regulation of each segment of bowel must be dynamic and integrated with other
parts of the gut, or the consequences could be potentially disastrous.
</p>
<p>There are three major types of motility pattern in the gut (Fig. 2.9). (1)
Segmentation is the non-propulsive annular contraction of the circular muscle layer</p>

</p>
<p>that is predominantly found in the small and large intestines. Its major function
is to mix intestinal chyme through its squeezing action; (2) Tonic contractions
characterize certain regions of the gut that serve as sphincters for dividing the gut
into functional segments. Important aspects of these regions are mechanisms that
can inhibit tonic contraction to allow luminal contents to pass at appropriate times;
(3) Peristalsis describes a highly integrated, complex motor pattern marked by
sequential annular contractions of gut segments that produce a sweeping, propulsive
wave forcefully moving luminal contents distally. Further discussion of these
patterns in the context of specific bowel functions is provided below.
</p>
<p>4 Chewing and Swallowing
</p>
<p>Chewing of food is a voluntary act, though in some de-cerebrate patients chewing
responses to food may occur reflexively. Chewing stimulates output from the
salivary glands, stomach, pancreas and liver via neural and endocrine reflex
pathways. Swallowing of food begins voluntarily but then proceeds reflexively
through extrinsic nerves of the pharyngeal muscle.
</p>
<p>An illustration of afferent and efferent systems involved in swallowing is shown
in Fig. 2.10. The bolus of food forces the soft palate upward, sealing off the nasal
pharynx as a possible route of exit for the food. The posterior tongue pushes the
bolus backward, using the hyoid bone as a fulcrum and the hard palate as a trough,
along which the tongue is able to guide the food. When the bolus reaches the
posterior wall of the pharynx, the upper pharyngeal muscle contracts above the
bolus and forces it down into the pharyngeal channel away from the nasal pharynx.
During this process, the distal pharyngeal muscles relax to make way for the food.
Relaxation of the cricopharyngeus muscle and upward movement of the cricoid
cartilage open the upper esophageal sphincter for food to enter the esophagus.
Concomitantly, the epiglottis moves up and the glottis closes off the trachea to the
food. The bolus is pushed to the pharyngeal area by peristaltic action of pharyngeal
muscles. Once the bolus passes the upper esophageal sphincter, the pharyngeal
muscular structure returns to its resting position and awaits another swallow.
</p>
<p>5 Esophagus Motility
</p>
<p>The sole purpose of the esophagus, which is about 25 cm in length, is to convey
food from the pharynx to the stomach. To achieve this, the esophagus is coordinated
at both ends by a structure, called sphincter, the cricopharyngeus or the upper
esophageal sphincter (UES) at the top and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)
at the bottom. The UES is easily identified anatomically with the thickening of</p>

and swallowing of food thereafter proceeds reflexively. This is achieved by forcing the soft palate

bolus backward. (3) The upper pharyngeal muscle contracts above the bolus at the posterior wall
of the pharynx, forcing it down into the pharyngeal channel away from the nasal pharynx. Distal
pharyngeal muscles relax to receive the bolus, and the upper esophageal sphincter opens to allow
passage into the esophagus. Concomitantly, the epiglottis moves up and the glottis closes off the
trachea to prevent entry of food into the respiratory tract. (4) With passage of the bolus through
the upper esophageal sphincter, the pharyngeal muscles return to their resting position and await

</p>
<p>circular muscle and elevated pressure; while the LES is not evident as an anatomical
entity, it exists functionally with elevated pressure.
</p>
<p>In humans, the upper one third of the esophagus consists of striated muscle
and the lower one third of smooth muscle, while the middle one third is mixed.
The sequence of events following a swallow is termed primary peristalsis. When
swallowing is initiated, the UES opens, and food is pushed into the upper esophagus
by a peristaltic wave that begins in the pharynx, closing the UES after it sweeps
over it, and moves distally at about 2&ndash;4 cm/s through the body of the esophagus.
When the peristaltic wave approaches the lower esophagus, the LES relaxes to let
food enter the stomach. Contractions stop at the gastro-esophageal junction and do
not proceed into the gastric musculature. Secondary peristalsis waves may also be
initiated in the absence of swallowing. These are propulsive muscular contractions
that are stimulated by distention of the body of the esophagus. They serve to clear
retained food and fluid or remove refluxed gastric contents from the esophagus.</p>

can be excitatory (left) or
inhibitory (right)
</p>
<p>5.1 Neural Regulation of Esophageal Motility
</p>
<p>Both intrinsic and extrinsic nerves are necessary for peristalsis to occur. However,
their relative roles in initiating and controlling peristalsis remain uncertain. It
is likely that cholinergic fibers of the vagus nerve play an important role in
modulating the sequence of events. More recently, the role of nonadrenergic,
noncholinergic intrinsic neurons in mediating peristalsis has been described,
especially neurons that make vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and nitric oxide.
</p>
<p>The LES has a very important function in allowing food to enter the stomach
and preventing the reflux of gastric contents back into the esophagus. At least
two serious diseases namely reflux esophagitis (gastro-esophageal reflux disease
or GERD) and achalasia (discussed below) can be attributed to dysfunction
of the LES. Sphincter pressure is affected by many endogenous factors in the
body, as well as by several food substances (Fig. 2.11). For example, coffee, fats,
and ethanol sometimes decrease LES pressure, and many neural and hormonal
agents have been shown to affect it, although only a few have been identified
as physiologically important. Some appear to directly affect smooth muscle cells,
and others modulate interneuron and/or motor activities. Those believed to be
physiologically relevant inhibitory regulators include nitric oxide and VIP; they
may be secreted from enteric neurons in the LES that receive input from the vagal
fibers. Agents such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), CCK, somatostatin,
and glucagon appear to decrease sphincter tone experimentally, but neural fibers
expressing these agents have not been found in the LES. Thus, these agents may
work by an endocrine or possibly paracrine pathway and may have relatively minor
or predominantly modulatory roles in LES regulation. Although stimulation of the
sphincter by prostaglandins can also decrease tone, they are not believed to be
important in normal circumstances. Of the agents that increase sphincter pressure,
acetylcholine, ˛-adrenergic agonists, bombesin, and met-enkephalin have been
implicated as having important physiological roles. Histamine can both increase
and decrease sphincter tone, depending on the receptor subtype stimulated. Gastrin
is now believed to have a role in regulating sphincter tone.</p>

</p>
<p>5.2 Esophageal Motility Dysfunctions
</p>
<p>Given the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms of esophageal motility, it
is not surprising that many clinical disorders have been described, some being
quite common and other debilitating. Achalasia is a condition characterized by
dysphagia (i.e. difficulty in swallowing) that results from the failure of the LES
to relax, thereby causing a functional obstruction. Furthermore, there is a loss of
peristalsis of the esophageal body. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of the
disease are still uncertain, many patients demonstrate a loss of ganglion cells of the
myenteric plexus. These findings have led us to believe that loss of critical inhibitory
enteric neurons results in a LES that is tonically contracted. Alternatively, there is
evidence of neural defects in the vagal dorsal nucleus of the brainstem, which could
produce the motor abnormalities observed in achalasia. Tertiary contractions are
often seen, particularly with age. These are non-peristaltic, spastic, uncoordinated
contractions usually occurring in the distal esophagus. Although they are always
abnormal, they usually do not cause symptoms. Reflux esophagitis or GERD is a
disease that arises when LES tone is reduced, thereby allowing gastric contents to
reflux into the lower esophagus. Since gastric juices are corrosive to the esophageal
mucosa, the distal esophagus becomes inflamed and sometimes ulcerated. Patients
experience extreme heartburn, and not infrequently severe scarring and stricture
at the lower esophagus develop, which can sometimes cause an anatomical
obstruction to the passage of food.
</p>
<p>6 Gastric Motility
</p>
<p>There are three major important motor functions of the stomach. First, its
muscle relaxes to accommodate large volumes during a meal, i.e. receptive relax-
ation; second, its contraction mixes ingested material with gastric juice, thus
facilitating digestion, solubilizing some constituents, and reducing the size of the
food particles, i.e. mixing and propulsion; third, its contraction propels gastric
content, called gastric chyme, into the duodenum at a regulated rate so as to provide
optimal time for intestinal digestion and absorption, i.e. gastric emptying. The first
of these functions is possible through a mechanism called receptive relaxation. After
the LES opens, the fundus and upper body of the stomach relax to receive the
bolus of food. This portion of the stomach has the ability to accommodate a wide
range of gastric volumes (0.5&ndash;1.5 L) without significant increases in intragastric
pressure. Relaxation of the proximal stomach associated with the act of swallowing
is mediated by vagal inhibitory fibers because vagotomy (surgical interruption of
the vagal nerve to the stomach) reduces distensibility of the proximal stomach.
In contrast, distensibility of the proximal stomach is increased by release of GI
hormones such as secretin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), and CCK.</p>

<p>Fig. 2.12 Pacemaker cells in the regulation of gastric peristalsis. Peristalsis, which is the major
motor activity of the distal stomach, is initiated and regulated by specialized pacemaker cells in
the mid-portion of the greater curvature. Muscular contractions occur when spike potentials appear
during the depolarizing phase of the BER. The probability of spike potentials is increased by vagal
or gastrin stimulation
</p>
<p>The distal stomach must mix gastric contents with gastric secretion and slowly
empty the gastric chyme into the small intestine. The major motor activity in this
part of the stomach is peristalsis, which is initiated and regulated by specialized
pacemaker cells in the mid portion of the greater curvature of the stomach
(Fig. 2.12). Despite the uniform BER frequency of the gastric motor cells from
this area of the stomach to the pylorus, there is a phase lag of distal segments,
essential to preventing simultaneous depolarization of all parts of the distal stomach.
Muscular contractions occur when spike potentials appear during the depolarizing
phase of the BER. The probability of contractions is increased by vagal or gastrin
stimulation. With increasing appearance of spike potentials, peristaltic contrac-
tions approach and eventually equal the BER frequency of 3&ndash;4/min. Conversely,
spike potentials are decreased by vagotomy, sympathetic stimulation, and secretin.
Because of the phase lag from the midpoint of the greater curvature to the pylorus,
peristaltic waves will proceed smoothly in a rostral-to-caudal direction. The motion,
referred to as antral systole, can last up to 10 s. Pyloric sphincter function is
closely coordinated with antral motor activity, augmenting the grinding process (see
below) of gastric contents and slowing the emptying of gastric chyme into the small
intestine. During antral systole, the pyloric sphincter partially closes, resulting in
retropulsion of antral contents, as the antrum contracts. This process facilitates the
breaking up of particulate matter and the mixing of food with gastric secretions
(analogous to the agitation cycle of a washing machine). Small amounts of food
(usually those that have been digested or are more liquid) pass through the pyloric
sphincter and enter the small intestine. These events are summarized in Fig. 2.13.</p>

regions. (2) As the bolus of food enters the stomach, the fundus and upper body of the stomach
relax to receive it. (3) Through peristalsis, the distal stomach mixes the gastric contents with gastric
secretions and slowly empties the gastric chyme into the small intestine. (4) As peristalsis proceeds
through the gastric antrum, the pyloric sphincter partially closes, resulting in retropulsion of antral
contents as the antrum contracts. This process facilities the breakup of particulate matter and the
mixing of food with gastric secretions. Small amounts of liquidized and digested food enter the
small intestine through the narrow pyloric channel
</p>
<p>6.1 Neural and Hormonal Regulation of Gastric Emptying
</p>
<p>The small intestine has a limited capacity and can only accept small amounts of
gastric chyme at any one period of time. The pyloric sphincter, therefore, plays
a very important role in this respect. However, the small intestine also releases
a number of hormonal factors that inhibit gastric emptying. These factors are
stimulated by the presence of unsaturated soaps and fatty acids of chain lengths
of C12 or greater. Denervation fails to abolish the effect of fat in the proximal
small bowel on gastric motility. Gastric emptying is also inhibited by a number of
enterogastric reflexes. For example, the presence in the duodenum and jejunum
of hyper- or hypotonic fluids, acid (pH &lt; 3.5), polypeptides, oligosaccharides,
and fatty acids result in the inhibition of gastric peristaltic contractions. With the
exception of the response to fat, inhibition by these substances in the upper small
bowel is abolished by vagotomy, indicating a neurogenic regulatory pathway rather
than a hormonal regulatory mechanism. Over-distension of the bowel also causes
inhibition of gastric motor activity, as well as the inhibition of the rest of the GI
tract. This reflex is called the intestino-intestinal reflex.
</p>
<p>In general, receptor activation in the stomach and duodenum sensitive to disten-
sion, changes in osmolarity, pH, or lipid content can trigger pathways that regulate
gastric emptying. In this regard, the excitatory influences that originate in the
stomach are kept in check by inhibitory mechanisms that originate in the duodenum</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>52 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>so as to have gastric chyme delivered in metered doses to the duodenum. These
inhibitory mechanisms for gastric emptying, i.e. neural and hormonal pathways,
prevent the upper small intestine from being overwhelmed by material from the
stomach. In addition, various emotional states, such as anger, fear and depression,
produce changes in gastric motor activity. Figure 2.14 summarizes the intestinal
phase pathways that inhibit gastric emptying.
</p>
<p>6.2 Gastric Motility Dysfunctions
</p>
<p>As described, gastric emptying is regulated at a rate optimal for digestion and
absorption of a meal. Abnormalities of gastric emptying thus lead to several clinical
problems. Rapid emptying of gastric contents into the small intestine, for instance,
can cause &ldquo;dumping syndrome,&rdquo; characterized by nausea, pallor, sweating, vertigo,
and sometimes fainting within minutes after a meal or ingestion of a hypertonic
solution. The symptoms are very similar to the vasovagal syndrome, in which
massive systemic discharge of vagal fibers causes vasodilation and a fall in arterial
blood pressure. The pathophysiological basis of this syndrome may be, in part,
related to the exaggerated release of enteric hormones such as GIP, neurotensin,
VIP, and enteroglucagon, which have significant vascular effects. On the other hand,
&ldquo;gastroparesis&rdquo; is a condition characterized by impaired or absent ability of the
stomach to empty. This condition is occasionally observed in severely diabetic
patients who develop autonomic neuropathy. The loss of vagal stimulation to
the stomach markedly impairs antral systole, preventing the proper digestion and
emptying of gastric contents. These patients often complain of early satiety (feeling
of being full), abnormal bloating, and nausea.
</p>
<p>7 Motility of the Small Intestine
</p>
<p>As the major site of digestion and absorption of nutrients, the small intestine has two
major motor functions, namely mixing and propulsion. Multiple short (1&ndash;2 cm long)
annular constrictions, called segmentations, frequently appear in the small bowel
and cause an apparent to-and-fro movement of the intestinal chyme. The frequency
of segmental contractions is dependent on the regional BER rate, which decreases
from proximal to distal small intestine. Thus, the duodenum can contract with a
basic rate up to approximately 11cycles/min, whereas contractions in the ileum can
only approach 8 cycles/min. The decreasing gradient of BER frequency promotes
the distal movement of intestinal chyme (Fig. 2.15).</p>

<p>Like other parts of the bowel, muscular contractions of the small intestine are
stimulated by extrinsic and intrinsic factors. For example, CCK, bombesin, opioid
peptides (e.g. met-enkephalin), tachykinins such as substance P, and acetylcholine
are stimulatory. Sympathetic discharges, ˛- adrenergic agonists, CGRP, nitric oxide,
VIP, and glucagon are inhibitory. Glucagon, for example, is frequently used by
radiologists and endoscopists to inhibit intestinal motility during diagnostic studies.
Propulsive motor contractions of the small intestine are far less frequent than
segmentations. However, after ingestion of a meal and entry of gastric chyme into
the proximal small intestine, peristaltic-like waves occur, mostly confined to the
upper small bowel. These waves travel relatively short distances but unequivocally
move intestinal contents in an aboral direction. The stimulus for these short
peristaltic waves appears to be the distention of the intestinal wall by luminal
contents.
</p>
<p>7.1 Migrating Motor Complex
</p>
<p>During fasting or interdigestive periods, a specific pattern of propulsive motor
activity in the stomach and small intestine can be observed. This pattern is
characterized by cyclic motor activity migrating from stomach to distal ileum.
Each cycle consists of a quiescent period (phase I), followed by a period of
irregular electrical and mechanical activity (phase II), and finally by a short
phase of regular activity (phase III), where electrical spike potentials peak and
mechanical frequencies approximate the BER (Fig. 2.16). This specific peristalis,
called the migrating motor complex (MMC), can best be followed by measuring</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 2.16 Migrating motor complex of the intestine. Seen during fasting or interdigestive periods,
this type of motor activity is characterized by cyclic motor activity migrating from the stomach
to distal ileum. A quiescent (phase I) period is followed by a period of irregular electrical and
mechanical activity (phase II) and finally by a short phase of regular activity (phase III). MMCs
are believed to serve a &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; function, preparing the bowel for the next meal. MMCs are
immediately interrupted when a meal is ingested. MMC indicates migrating motor complex
</p>
<p>phase III events. Occurring about every 90 min, the MMC migrates from the
stomach to terminal ileum at a rate of approximately 5 cm/m. Several hormones
may be involved in the initiation of MMCs, including motilin, opioid peptides
and somatostatin, albeit to varying degrees and in different regions of the bowel.
Although their physiological role is still uncertain, MMCs are believed to have a
&ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; function, clearing the stomach and small bowel of luminal contents,
thus preparing the bowel for the next meal. MMCs are immediately interrupted
when a meal is ingested, an inhibitory effect probably mediated by extrinsic neural
signals and, in part, by gut peptides such as gastrin and CCK. On the other hand,
the orderly propagation of MMCs down the digestive tract is dependent on the
regulation by enteric neurons. The enteric nervous system additionally coordinates
MMC-motor activities with other intestinal functions such as gastric, biliary, and
pancreatic secretions, as well as intestinal blood flow (Fig. 2.17).</p>

</p>
<p>7.2 Small Intestinal Dysmotility
</p>
<p>Two other motility patterns of the small intestine merit brief discussion, as they
are clinically relevant and often occur as a consequence of other pathophysiological
processes. The first is &ldquo;vomiting&rdquo;, which is frequently associated with nausea and
can be evoked by many different stimuli. It is a stereotypic response which is
dependent on both central and enteric nervous systems. When the vomiting center
in the brain is stimulated, a diffuse autonomic neural discharge occurs that activates
the enteric neural network responsible for the vomiting reflex. The reflex involves
the closing of the glottis after inspiration, contraction of the abdominal muscles
causing increased abdominal pressure, and retropulsion of intestinal and gastric
contents by retrograde power contractions (reverse peristalsis) beginning in
the upper small intestine. The second pattern is an adynamic state of the small
intestine called &ldquo;ileus&rdquo; that is often initiated by noxious stimuli such as abdominal
trauma or perforation and occasionally by medications such as opiates. During the
state of ileus, bowel sounds are absent and air-fluid levels are observed on plain
upright X-ray films of the abdomen. MMCs are absent and the bowel motility
is characterized by prolongation of phase I, the quiescent phase of the motor
activity.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2 Gastrointestinal Motility 57
</p>
<p>8 Motility of Large Intestine
</p>
<p>The colon of an adult human receives 0.5&ndash;2.5 L of chyme per day. This consists of
undigested and unabsorbed residues of food, in addition to water and electrolytes.
The colon must reduce the volume of this intestinal chyme to about 100&ndash;200 g
of fecal material before excretion. Hence, the movements of the colon are slow
and irregular and serve mainly to segment its content to increase contact with the
absorbing surface.
</p>
<p>The colon lacks a continuous layer of longitudinal muscle. Instead, the muscles
are organized into three flat bands called the teniae coli. Contractions of teniae coli
cause the colon to open and close in a manner similar to an accordion. Segmental
contractions of the circular muscle layer divide the colon into segments called
haustrations and represent the main motor activity in the colon. Like other parts
of the bowels, the frequency of segmentations is dependent on regional BER rates.
However, in contrast to the situation in the small intestine, there are increasing
gradients of BER frequency from rostral to caudal (Fig. 2.18). This provides an
effective means for the more distal part of the colon to mix the luminal contents,
allowing the absorptive surface area to maximally extract water and electrolytes and
solidify fecal contents.
</p>
<p>Three to four times a day, a mass movement occurs wherein the segmental
contractions of the left colon disappear and a simultaneous contraction of the right
colon propels its content distally. This tends to occur after meals and has been
referred to as the gastric colic reflex. True peristaltic waves are extremely rare in
the colon. Most often adjacent segments of colon appear to contract independent of
each other. These segmental contractions are generally increased in amplitude and
stimulated by eating or by the presence of bulk in the colon.
</p>
<p>Fig. 2.18 Gradient of basic electrical rhythm (BER) in human colon. There appears to be an
increasing gradient of BER frequency from rostral to caudal in the human colon. This provides
an effective means for the mixing of luminal contents in the distal part, allowing the absorptive
surface area to extract water and electrolytes efficiently and solidify fecal contents</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>58 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>Extrinsic cholinergic nerves can not only directly stimulate mechanical activity
of the colon but they also modulate motility by their actions on interneurons
and postganglionic enteric motor neurons. In contrast, sympathetic neurons inhibit
colonic motility. However, the enteric nervous system plays a major role in
regulating colonic motor, transport, and blood flow functions. Like other parts of the
bowel, neurotransmitters of the enteric nervous system are inhibitory or excitatory.
</p>
<p>9 Rectal Function and Defecation
</p>
<p>Motility of the rectum and the anal sphincters are quite distinct from colonic
motility. The rectum has two primary functions: (1) to serve as a storage site
for feces and (2) to expel feces during defecation. Thus, the rectum must have
the ability to accommodate a certain volume of stool. When this capacity is
exceeded, intramural stretch receptors are activated, making the individual aware
of the urgency of the forthcoming event and relax the internal anal sphincter. The
individual then increases intra-abdominal pressure by forcing air against the closed
glottis (Valsalva maneuver) and relaxes the external anal sphincter, which is made
of skeletal muscle (Fig. 2.19). The individual can inhibit defecation by voluntarily

pressure measurements (Modified from Davenport [4])</p>

<p>2 Gastrointestinal Motility 59
</p>
<p>increasing the tone of external anal sphincter, which transiently increases internal
sphincter tone. However, as rectal pressure builds, the urge to defecate increases
and the above processes are again initiated.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; The GI motility is well organized for optimal digestion and absorption functions.
&bull; It is regulated by neural, hormonal and myogenic control systems.
&bull; The rhythm of the GI tract is generated by myogenic system of the smooth
</p>
<p>muscle layer that undergoes spontaneous depolarization and repolarization
cycles, known as slow-waves which contribute to the basic electrical rhythm
(BER).
</p>
<p>&bull; The frequency of BER is determined by the slow waves which is essentially
constant.
</p>
<p>&bull; The force of contractions is determined by the number of spikes fired within each
wave, which depends in turn on the neural and hormonal input.
</p>
<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>A 1-week old infant boy presents with a history of vomiting, abdominal distention,
and constipation. He has not been nursing well and appears irritable. Physical
examination reveals a distended, tympanitic (drum-like) abdomen, and hyperactive
bowel sounds, consistent with intestinal obstruction. A plain x-ray film of the
abdomen shows a large ovoid mass mottled by small, irregular gas shadows in the
right side of the colon, consistent with fecal retention and an area of obstruction
is suspected. A barium enema shows narrowing in the distal segment of rectum.
An open biopsy of the wall of the narrowed rectum is performed under general
anesthesia.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. Based on the clinical observation, what is the diagnosis of the patient?
Answer: This child has Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease (Congenital megacolon).
</p>
<p>2. Explain briefly the pathogenesis of this disease.
Answer: Congenital megacolon is characterized by a functional obstruction
of the colon resulting from aganglionosis (an absence of ganglion cells) of
the bowel wall. The rectum and sigmoid colon are the most common sites of
involvement. Full thickness biopsy (the diagnostic procedure of choice) shows
the hallmark of the disease, which is the absence of ganglion cells in the
myenteric and submucosal plexuses. The absence of enteric neurons, especially
those secreting nitric oxide and VIP, results in a loss of inhibitory tone necessary
to counteract excitatory motor neurons that contract muscle fibers in the anal
sphincter and other distal segments of the colon. Consequently, colonic contents
cannot pass through the involved segment and the patient experiences symptoms
of intestinal obstruction.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>60 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>3. How do you treat the patient?
Answer: Treatment of the disease involves surgical removal of the involved
segment.
</p>
<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>A 20-year-old student has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM: juvenile
onset and insulin deficient) since age 15 who presents with severe constipation,
abdominal distention, and severe heartburn, especially in the supine position.
Occasionally, she experiences dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), particularly
when solid foods are ingested. In the past several months, she has also had
abdominal discomfort and fullness immediately after eating small amounts of food.
On physical examination, she has diabetic retinopathy, orthostatic hypotension (drop
in blood pressure after standing), and moderately severe peripheral neuropathy.
Upper GI and small bowel barium X-ray studies reveal a dilated stomach, retained
food material, and retention of over half of the barium after 30 min. The small
intestine is noted to have some nonspecific dilatations. The colon is filled with
feces.
</p>
<p>From this case presentation, it is a type of T1DM-induced gut dysmotility.
</p>
<p>Based on your knowledge of diabetes and on the findings of the physical
</p>
<p>examination, how would you explain the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and radiologic
</p>
<p>findings at different levels of GI tract dysfunction?
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. Esophageal dysfunction?
Answer: A major consequence of severe and long-standing diabetes mellitus
is the development of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. The latter has
numerous effects on bowel function, a major manifestation being the develop-
ment of abnormal bowel motility. Because the extent and severity of autonomic
dysfunction vary considerably from patient to patient, the clinical presentation of
patients are quite protean. Many patients experience esophageal and swallowing
symptoms as a consequence of altered or aberrant sphincter functions and/or peri-
stalsis. Tertiary contractionsmay become more pronounced and frequent. Loss
of lower esophageal sphincter tone can result in symptoms of reflux esophagitis
(heartburn, chest pain) because of acid-pepsin injury of the esophageal lining.
The barium X-ray study shows reflux of the barium column into the esophagus.
</p>
<p>2. Gastric dysfunction?
Answer: Autonomic neuropathy can also affect gastric emptying. The stomach
becomes flaccid and antral peristalsis is defective or lost. This condition, called
diabetic gastroparesis, is not uncommon. Barium remains in the stomach for
10 hours after ingestion, indicative of delayed emptying. Gastroparesis can result
in the formation of a bezoar, a conglomerated mass of undigested vegetable and
fruit fiber.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>2 Gastrointestinal Motility 61
</p>
<p>3. Small intestinal dysfunction?
Answer: Autonomic neuropathy of the small intestine can cause intestinal
stasis, a condition that favors luminal colonization and overgrowth by bacteria.
These organisms compete for luminal nutrients, thus causing nutrient malabsorp-
tion and diarrhea.
</p>
<p>4. Colonic dysfunction?
Answer: Finally, the normal function of the colon and rectum is frequently
affected by diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Patients can develop severe con-
stipation or diarrhea. In addition, the loss of anal sphincter tone and the
afferent nerves required for sensing the presence of stool in the rectal vault may
develop. These patients may lose normal defecation function and experience
fecal incontinence. The treatment of intestinal complications associated with
diabetes is particularly problematic, as the neuropathy is usually irreversible.
</p>
<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A 40-year-old woman presents with a progressive history of dysphagia. She has
difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids and finds that it is worse when she
experiences periods of emotional stress or eats too rapidly. She has found that
alcohol is of some benefit in helping the food pass into the stomach. Occasionally,
when she is supine or is exercising, she regurgitates food particles from meals eaten
hours before. Several weeks ago, she was treated with antibiotics for bronchopneu-
monia. On physical examination, she appears to be normal. The only significant
finding is that she has halitosis (bad breath). On chest x-ray film, an air-fluid level
is noted in the posterior mediastinal area. A barium swallow is taken which reveals
a dilated lower esophagus. Esophageal manometry of the patient is subsequently
ordered.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What would you expect these examinations to show? Explain the pathophys-
iology of this disease.
</p>
<p>Answer: This patient has achalasia, a condition in many ways similar to
Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease. It is a neuromuscular disorder that affects the LES
and is characterized by the failure of the sphincter to relax during the process
of swallowing. Normally, the LES is richly innervated by VIP- and nitric
oxide-secreting enteric neurons of the myenteric plexus that provide inhibitory
tone during the terminal phase of esophageal peristalsis, allowing the food
bolus to pass into the stomach. The loss of inhibitory tone and impairment of
sphincter relaxation causes a functional obstruction of the esophagus. Alcohol
can result in transient symptomatic relief, as it causes proximal dilation of the
esophagus and retention of luminal contents, which explain the patient&rsquo;s halitosis
(fermentation of retained esophageal contents) and the air-fluid level observed
radiographically. On occasion, especially at night when the patient is supine, the
luminal contents of the esophagus are regurgitated and aspirated. This can cause
bronchopneumonia, as was the case with this patient.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>62 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>2. What would you recommend for the treatment of this patient?
Answer: The treatment of this disease is either esophageal dilation or surgical
myotomy of the lower esophageal sphincter. Esophageal dilation is performed
with an inflatable balloon or luminal dilator, which splits the sphincter. Patients
often require repeated dilation over time, as the condition recurs. Recently,
botulinum toxin injection is an alternative approach to treating the disease; it is
achievable based on the rationale that the toxin is to decrease cholinergic input,
thus reducing the LES pressure.

</p>
<p>1 Introduction to the Gastric Functions
</p>
<p>Our stomach produces about 2L/day of gastric acid secretion/juice. Its high HC ions
(pHD1&ndash;2) kill most of the ingested germs; it catalyzes the conversion of inactive
pepsinogen to pepsin. The presence of acid/pepsin begins the digestion of dietary
protein. However, pancreatic proteases can hydrolyze all ingested protein in the
absence of pepsin. An important component of gastric juice is intrinsic factor (IF),
which binds vitamin B12 in the duodenum, allowing it to be eventually absorbed
in the distal ileum (see B12 absorption of Chap. 9); it is the only indispensable
substance of gastric juice. Its deficiency, following gastric surgery or in pernicious
anemia, must take injections of B12 or oral B12 with IF. The surface epithelia cells
of stomach secrete mucus and bicarbonate that protect the mucosa from acid/pepsin
erosion.
</p>
<p>Understanding gastric physiology is important for all physicians in light of the
numerous patients who present with stomach diseases. The pharmaceutical industry
has taken advantage of the knowledge gained through basic research to develop
therapeutic compounds that have revolutionized the treatment of acid peptic-related
diseases. In fact, medications for the treatment of dyspepsia and peptic ulcer
diseases are currently the most frequently prescribed on the market (see Sect. 5.2).

<p>Fig. 3.1 Anatomical and functional regions of the stomach. The anatomical division of the
stomach consists of the fundus, antrum, and corpus (body) that reflects differences in motor
function. Functionally speaking, the stomach has two major regions: an exocrine or glandular
portion that consists of the fundus and body or acid-secreting area, and an endocrine portion that
is located in the antrum or gastrin-secreting area
</p>
<p>1.1 Functional and Anatomical Organization of the Stomach
</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 3.1, the anatomical subdivision of the stomach into the fundus,
antrum and body (corpus) mirrors differences in motor function (Chap. 2). The
fundus functions as a reservoir for ingested meals, the body as the initial site
of peristalsis, and the antral-pyloric region as the site of the greatest mechanical
agitation and mixing of food with gastric secretions. In terms of gastric mucosal
function, however, the stomach can be divided into two major regions: the
&ldquo;exocrine&rdquo; or glandular portion (acid-secreting area) found in the mucosa of
the fundus and body and the &ldquo;endocrine&rdquo; part (hormone-secreting area) located
in the antral mucosa. Discussion in this chapter will focus on the gastric mucosal
functions.
</p>
<p>Acid-Secreting (Exocrine) Area
</p>
<p>The mucosa of the exocrine portion of the stomach consists of simple columnar
epithelial cells that line the luminal surface. These cells secrete mucus and an
alkaline fluid, both necessary for protecting the stomach against its own potentially
harmful juices. Opening into the mucosal surface are numerous gastric pits that
serve as conduits for the secretions of 3&ndash;7 oxyntic gastric glands (Fig. 3.2a) into
the gastric lumen. The area occupied by the gastric pits is at least 50 % of the
total luminal surface area. As shown in Fig. 3.2b, the remainder of the gastric or
oxyntic gland can be further divided into two regions.The neck of the oxyntic gland
contains parietal and mucous neck cells, the latter resembling intestinal goblet cells
and secreting mucus. The neck region is also the site of germinal cell proliferation
and differentiation, giving rise to surface cells that migrate up to the surface or
glandular cells that move downward toward the base. Cells progressively mature as</p>

mucosa are somatostatin-secreting D cells and gastrin-secreting G cells. The D cells are believed
to have dendritic-like extensions of their cell membranes that span to adjacent G cells, which are

<p>the active form pepsin. Mucous cells make mucus, an essential component that
lubricates and protects the gastric mucosa, and those at surface and in gastric
pits also secrete bicarbonate. Interspersed among these cells of the oxyntic gland
are enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells that regulate their functions by secretion
of bioactive amines and peptides. Finally, a number of mast-like cells found in
close apposition to epithelial cells of the gastric gland secrete histamine. In humans,
they are believed to be important physiological regulators of gastric acid and pepsin
secretion, an effect mediated through a paracrine action.
</p>
<p>Hormone-Secreting (Endocrine) Area
</p>
<p>The antral-pyloric or hormone-secreting area contains mucus-secreting cells
similar to those seen in oxyntic glands, as well as a limited number of parietal
and pepsinogen-secreting cells. However, this region of the stomach is the major
source of gastrin secreted by the endocrine G cells of the mucosa. These cells are
pyramidal in shape and have a narrow apical surface with long microvilli (Fig. 3.3).
Secretory granules are located at the base of the cell, and the release of gastrin
occurs by fusion and exocytosis with the basolateral membrane. Endocrine D
cells, also found in the antral-pyloric region, elaborate somatostatin, an important
physiological regulator of gastrin release and gastric acid secretion. D cells appear
to have dendritic-like extensions of their cell membranes that span to adjacent G
cells, consistent with a paracrine regulation of mucosal function. These processes
make the delivery of somatostatin to G cells rapid and highly selective. At least
seven additional types of enteroendocrine cells can be found in the gastric mucosa;
however, their physiological role in the regulation of gastric function is not as well-
defined.</p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3 Gastric Physiology 67
</p>
<p>2 Gastric Acid Secretion
</p>
<p>2.1 Neural and Hormonal Regulation of Gastric Acid
</p>
<p>Secretion
</p>
<p>Acid secretion is regulated by nerves and GI hormones. Although the understanding
of their mechanisms of actions is still incomplete, accumulated evidence has been
learned about the regulation and cell biology of acid secretion to have had a major
impact on the treatment of patients with peptic ulcer disease.
</p>
<p>There are threemajor stimulators of acid secretion: (1) gastrin (predominantly
secreted by antral G cells), (2) histamine (in humans probably arising from
mast-like cells in the lamina propria subjacent to the gastric epithelium), and
(3) acetylcholine (secreted from postsynaptic vagal fibers innervating the gastric
mucosa). On the other hand Somatostatin, secreted from antral and oxyntic gland
D cells as well as pancreatic islet cells, and prostaglandins from mucosal cells, are
themajor paracrine inhibitors of gastric acid secretion.
</p>
<p>The interaction of these regulators is extremely complex, and several issues
remain controversial. For instance, it is still not clear at what level certain agents
regulate acid secretion. Specific receptors on parietal cells for histamine, gas-
trin, and acetylcholine have been demonstrated, and their stimulation results in
acid secretion (Fig. 3.4). Histamine stimulates H2-type receptors and activates
adenylate cyclase to increase cellular content of cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP). The increase in cAMP, in turn, activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase,
which appears to be an important mediator in initiating acid secretion. However,
there is evidence that histamine may also increase cytosolic Ca2C concentrations,
through coupling with another signal transduction pathway such as phospholipase
C (mediating phosphatidylinositol metabolism). Gastrin and acetylcholine appear
to activate the phosphatidylinositol (PI) pathway, gastrin through the stimulation
of a specific gastrin receptor (CCKB) and acetylcholine through activation of
a M3-type muscarinic receptor. These agonists both increase intracellular free
calcium concentrations. However, there are some differences in the activation
pathways. Acid secretion stimulated by acetylcholine is dependent on the presence
of extracellular calcium, whereas the effects of gastrin are only partially affected
by this manipulation. Thus, the cellular mechanisms mediating these responses are
clearly more diverse and complex than previously thought. The physiological role
of protein kinase C, which is activated by the generation of diacylglycerol from
phosphatidylinositol metabolism, is unclear. Some evidence suggests that it has a
minor role in stimulation of acid secretion and may be more important in feedback
inhibition of parietal cell function. Finally, cAMP and calcium may interact in
a variety of ways to modulate cell activation. For example, potentiation can be
seen between agents that increase cytosolic calcium (gastrin and acetylcholine)
and cAMP (histamine), an observation that may have considerable clinical and
therapeutic relevance. The nature of this interaction remains undetermined.</p>

<p>Fig. 3.4 Cellular mechanism of acid secretion by the parietal cell. There are three basic acid
stimulants involved in the regulation of acid secretion, i.e. the neurocrine, acetylcholine; the
endocrine, gastrin; the paracrine, histamine. PIP2 phosphatidyl-4,5-bisphosphate, IP3 inositol
1,4,5-triphosphate
</p>
<p>In addition to their direct effects on parietal cell function, these agents appear to
affect other target cells involved in the regulation of acid secretion (Fig. 3.5). For
example, gastrin from antral G cells and acetylcholine from cholinergic neurons
stimulate specific receptors on mast or ECL cells, promoting the secretion of
histamine. Histamine potentiates the effects of each of these agents on parietal cell
secretion. Noradrenergic nerves inhibit histamine release from mast cells through
activation of &ldquo; receptors, the net effect being the inhibition of acid secretion.
</p>
<p>The role of somatostatin-secreting D cells in both the antral and acid-secreting
regions of the stomach also appears to be a major component of the regulatory
systems. In the antrum, somatostatin inhibits G-cell secretion of gastrin and is
released by the presence of luminal acid and gastrin (serving as negative feedback
mechanisms) and by stimulation from enteric neurons containing acetylcholine,
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). In the
exocrine portion of the stomach, D-cell release of somatostatin directly inhibits
parietal cell acid secretion. Alternatively, somatostatin also inhibits acid secretion
by decreasing histamine release by mast-like and ECL cells. Gastrin and chole-
cystokinin (CCK) stimulate somatostatin secretion, whereas cholinergic neurons
inhibit it.</p>

<p>Fig. 3.5 Interaction of
regulatory pathways in gastric
acid secretion. Apart from the
direct effects of the three
basic acid stimulants of
histamine, gastrin and
acetylcholine on parietal cell
functions, various regulatory
agents also affect other target
cells for modulating acid
secretion such as the
inhibitory action of
somatostatin
</p>
<p>The relative contribution of each of the aforementioned pathways in regulating
gastric acid secretion is highly variable among mammalian species and not entirely
elucidated in humans. However, it does appear that histamine plays a major role in
stimulating gastric acid secretion. Specific inhibitors of the histamine H2 receptor,
such as cimetidine and ranitidine, are clinically and experimentally very effective in
reducing acid secretion, in spite of the fact that the stimulatory effects of gastrin
and acetylcholine are still present. How can this be accounted for? A possible
explanation is that in the absence of histamine stimulation of parietal cells, there
is no potentiation of the gastrin or acetylcholine effects, thus diminishing acid
secretion. In addition, gastrin stimulation of somatostatin release would continue
unabated, further rendering a decrease in acid secretion.
</p>
<p>2.2 Cellular Mechanisms Mediating Gastric Acid Secretion
</p>
<p>Cellular Events
</p>
<p>When the parietal cell is stimulated, it undergoes rapid, dramatic morphologic
changes that are now known to be important in setting up the acid-secretory
apparatus. The resting, or non-secreting, parietal cell has a specialized network of
narrow channels that extend from the luminal surface throughmuch of the cell body
(Fig. 3.6a). These are secretory canaliculi, lined by short, stubby microvilli. There
is also an elaborate system of tubular and vesicular membranes (tubulovesicles) in
the luminal aspect of the cell. Large mitochondria, characteristically seen in these
cells, are essential for providing a high oxidative capacity during acid secretion.
</p>
<p>Within a few minutes of stimulation, microvilli lining the canaliculi become
longer and more elaborate. It is estimated that the luminal surface area increases</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>70 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.6 Morphological changes associated with parietal cell activation and secretion. (a) The
resting, or nonsecreting, parietal cell has many mitochondria and an elaborate system of tubular and
vesicular membranes near the luminal aspect of the cell. (b) With stimulation, the luminal surface
area increases six to tenfold, with a concomitant disappearance of tubulovesicle membranes. These
changes are caused by the fusion of the tubulovesicle membranes with the plasma membrane,
increasing the number and density of proton pumps in the apical surface (Courtesy of Dr. George
Sachs)
</p>
<p>to 6&ndash;10 times that of the resting state (Fig. 3.6b). Concomitant with these changes
is the disappearance of tubulovesicle membranes. Withdrawal of the stimulating
agents leads to a collapse of the canaliculi spaces and a return of the tubulovesicle
forms in the cytoplasm. These observations are consistent with the membrane
recycling that occurs during the stimulated and resting states of the parietal cell.
Tubulovesicles contain large amounts of the gastric proton-pump enzyme HC/KC-
ATPase. Following stimulation of the parietal cell, tubulovesicle membranes fuse
with the plasma membrane, increasing the number and density of proton pumps in
the apical surface. Conversely, withdrawal of the stimulus leads to endocytosis of
these membranes, a decrease in the density of proton pumps in the apical membrane,
and decreased acid secretion. The proton pump is only active when inserted
in the luminal membrane; it is inactive when re-sequestered into tubulovesicle
membranes.
</p>
<p>Electrolyte Transport
</p>
<p>The mechanism for proton secretion into the lumen is fairly well understood and
summarized in Fig. 3.7. The essential element here is a membrane-bound enzyme</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3 Gastric Physiology 71
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.7 Electrolyte transport
and acid secretion at the
luminal membrane of a
stimulated parietal cell. The
major component of acid
secretion is the
HC/KC-ATPase, or proton
pump, which actively
exchanges HC for KC. For
vectorial HC secretion to
occur, conductance pathways
for KC and Cl� must exit for
recycling of KC ions and
extrusion of Cl�, respectively
</p>
<p>that actively extrudes protons into the lumen in exchange for potassium ions. This
enzyme requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and hence is referred to as the
HC/KC-ATPase, or proton pump. Gastric HC/KC-ATPase is a member of the
phosphorylating, ion-motive ATPase gene family, which includes NaC/KC-ATPase
and Ca2C-ATPase. It is a heterodimer consisting of a larger catalytic subunit (˛)
and a smaller (ˇ) glycosylated subunit. The role of the &ldquo; subunit is unknown, but
it appears to be required for the proton to work as a functional unit. The proton
pump is electrically neural; that is, there is a one-for-one exchange of HC and KC,
with no net transfer of charge. Essential to the proton pump and acid secretion
is the presence of an exit pathway for KC, which is then recycled in exchange
for HC. This occurs through the coupled transport of KC and Cl� out of the cell via
respective conductive channels. The Cl� channel is distinct from the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane regulator (CFTR) channel. These exit pathways operate in tandem
with the proton pump, the net effect being the rapid secretion of hydrochloride into
the canalicular lumen. The KC and Cl� exit pathways may be the major rate-
determining factors in acid secretion, as both are regulated by cAMP-dependent
protein kinase. In addition, being voltage-gated channels, they are active only when
inserted into the luminal membrane where a favorable membrane potential exists.
To date, there is no evidence that supports direct kinase regulation of the proton
pump.
</p>
<p>The proton pump is somewhat unique in its actions. It has an enormous
active secretory capacity, capable of secreting protons against large electrochemical
gradients. As a consequence, luminal pH can approach the 1&ndash;2 range, representing
a 5&ndash;6 log unit difference from intracellular pH values of approximately 7. No
other part of the body can approach this level of acidification. Recently, several
highly specific and clinically useful inhibitors of the proton pimp have been
developed, specifically substituted-benzimidazole compounds such as omeprazole
and lansoprazole. Being weak acids with pKa values of approximately 4, these
agents are selectively (if not exclusively) taken up and concentrated in the acidified</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>72 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>secretory canaliculi of gastric parietal cells. In this acid environment, they are
converted to sulfonamides that are reactive with cysteine SH-thiol, but not cysteine
disulfides. Thus, these agents bind to specific sites in the extracellular (luminal)
domain of the &rsquo; subunit of the HC/KC-ATPase. As a result, ATPase activity and
proton transport cease. Because proton pump inhibitors block the final pathway,
acid secretion can be virtually shut down, and patients may become a state, called
achlorhydria. Omerprazole has therefore become a major part of the medical
armamentarium for treating peptic ulcer diseases.
</p>
<p>Because of the voluminous secretion of protons at the apical surface, equivalent
amounts of base must be delivered by the cell into blood plasma to maintain
normal intracellular pH. This is accomplished through a Cl�/HCO3� exchange
mechanism located in the basolateral membrane of parietal cells. This pathway
serves a dual purpose because it provides an entry pathway for chloride ions that
are then vectorially secreted with protons. Coupled with Cl�/HCO3� exchange
is NaC/HC exchanger, which is important for providing intracellular sodium for
recycling out of the cells via the sodium pump. This allows the sodium pump
to operate efficiently at high capacity to maintain the electrochemical gradients
required for proton secretion and to provide an entry pathway for potassium ions
(since gastric juices typically contain potassium concentrations that exceed plasma
potassium concentrations by twofold or more).
</p>
<p>2.3 Organismal Regulation of Gastric Functions
</p>
<p>Meal-Stimulated Gastric Acid Secretion
</p>
<p>At the organismal level, meal-associated stimulation of gastric secretion can
be divided into three phases (Fig. 3.8a). The cephalic phase includes responses
evoked by stimuli from the central nervous system, which can be initiated by the
sight, smell, or taste of food, as well as conditioned reflexes such as the sound of a
bell, and hypoglycemia induced by insulin injections or experimental administration
of a GABA-like agonist. This can best be demonstrated experimentally by &ldquo;sham
feeding,&rdquo; in which food is chewed but not allowed to enter the stomach. As
the duration of sham feeding lengthens, the magnitude of the gastric acid and
motor response increases. Three areas of the brainstem appear to be important
in relaying information to the stomach: the area postrema, nucleus tractus
solitarii (NTS), and the dorsal motor nucleus (DMN). A variety of neural peptides,
such as pancreatic polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, and peptide YY, may mediate the
cephalic-phase response, since administration of these peptides into the brain can
initiate the response. When these areas receive input from other parts of the brain
(sensory processing areas), and from peripheral hormonal and metabolic signals,
they activate gastric secretions through vagal nerve stimulation. Preganglionic vagal
fibers synapse with enteric neurons containing gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3 Gastric Physiology 73
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.8 Meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion. There are three phases that are important for
regulation of meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion; they are cephalic phase (a), gastric phase
(b), and intestinal phase (c). Of these, the gastric phase is believed to be the most important. NTS

<p>acetylcholine, which stimulate gastrin release in the antrum and acid secretion in the
body and fundus. Surgical secretion of the vagal nerve will completely abolish the
cephalic phase of gastric acid stimulation.
</p>
<p>The gastric phase (Fig. 3.8b) occurs when fluid or food is present in the gastric
lumen. This phase accounts for approximately 60 % of the total acid secretion
stimulated by a meal. A major component of this response is gastric distention
produced by luminal contents, particularly in the antrum. The greater the distention
is, the greater the gastric acid output. This response is mediated by both vagal nerve
fibers and local intrinsic factors, the latter being gastrin in particular. When the
stomach is minimally distended, vagal innervation appears to predominate, since
gastrin release is minimal. However, when the antrum is further distended, large
amounts of gastrin are promptly released, and acid secretion increases accordingly.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>74 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>Another major component of the gastric phase is the stimulation of gastrin release
by luminal nutrients, especially peptides and aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine
and tryptophan). Their presence is somehow sensed by antral G cells, which are
then stimulated to release gastrin. In addition, these luminal agents appear to
activate afferent enteric neurons that initiate reflex neural networks stimulating G-
cell secretion. In contrast to protein hydrolysates, carbohydrates and fats are not
potent stimuli of gastric acid secretion.
</p>
<p>The intestinal phase (Fig. 3.8c) is that component of gastric acid secretion
stimulated by the presence of food in the small intestine. It is the least important of
the various phases, accounting for less than 10 % of total gastric acid secretion. The
recognized initiators of this intestinal phase are distention and the digestion products
of protein. Part of the humoral mechanism of the intestinal phase is probably due
to absorbed amino acids, since intravenous administration of amino acids does
stimulate gastric acid secretion. The intestinal phase by itself is a weak stimulus of
gastric acid secretion but does appear to strongly potentiate the effects of histamine
and gastrin.
</p>
<p>Inhibitory Mechanisms of Gastric Acid Secretion
</p>
<p>In each phase of the gastric response to meals, factors inhibit the acid secretion that
accompanies stimulatory events. They play an important role in providing negative
feedback to control the magnitude of the secretory response and in eventually
bringing the stomach back to its resting state during interdigestive periods.
</p>
<p>Inhibition in the cephalic phase can be demonstrated by injection of bombesin,
calcitonin, neurotensin, interleukin-1 (IL-1), prostaglandins, or corticotropin-
releasing factor (CRF) into the brain. Their inhibitory effects appear to be
mediated by vagal and sympathetic fibers to the stomach. During the gastric
phase, acidification in the antral mucosa inhibits gastrin release stimulated by
sham feeding or by distention of the antrum. This effect is probably mediated by
enteric neurons, as administration of atropine inhibits it. Increased luminal acid
concentration also appears to stimulate the release of somatostatin from antral D
cells, which inhibits gastrin release via a paracrine action. In the intestinal phase,
three agents are known to inhibit acid secretion when instilled in the small intestine;
they are acid, hyperosmolar solutions, and fat (the latter being most potent).
The inhibition appears to be mediated by humoral substances collectively called
&ldquo;enterogastrones.&rdquo;Although no agent has been definitively identified, the candidate
hormones for enterogastrones include gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), neurotensin,
somatostatin, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), enteroglucagon, and
peptide YY. Of these, peptide YY is the most likely agent. It is released by fat
from the distal small intestine and inhibits pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion. In
addition to these mechanisms, gastric secretion is also inhibited by secretin, gastrin
releasing polypeptide (GRP), and cholecystokinin (CCK) (see Chap. 1).</p>

</p>
<p>3 Pepsinogen Secretion
</p>
<p>Pepsin is an important digestive enzyme secreted predominantly from gastric
chief cells in the form of pepsinogen, its precursor zymogen. These peptic cells
are located on the walls of the oxyntic glands and appear to be regulated by
many of the same agents involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion.
Not surprisingly, therefore, pepsinogen secretion parallels that of acid secretion.
Agents such as gastrin, acetylcholine, CCK, and GIP stimulate pepsinogen
release by increasing cytosolic Ca2C through receptor-mediated phosphatidylinosi-
tol metabolism (Fig. 3.9). Agents such as secretin, VIP, E-series of prostaglandins,
and ˇ-adrenergic receptor agonists stimulate peptic cells by activating adenylate
cyclase, resulting in the generation of cAMP and activation of a cAMP-dependent
protein kinase. Both signal transduction pathways appear to stimulate the release of
pepsinogen via exocytosis of secretory granules, but cAMP-mediated stimuli may
also directly stimulate de novo synthesis of pepsinogen.
</p>
<p>On release into the lumen, pepsinogen is immediately activated by acid, with
optimum pH being about 2. The formation of pepsin has a positive feedback
effect, leading to a more rapid and complete conversion of pepsinogen into pepsin
(Fig. 3.10).
</p>
<p>Pepsin belongs to the general class of aspartic protease, so named because of
the presence of two aspartic acid residues that are part of the catalytic site. It is a
very good proteolytic enzyme and, because of its high activity on collagen, is more
important for the digestion of meat than for vegetable protein. However, pepsin
digestion of proteins is usually incomplete, since large peptides called peptones are

<p>Fig. 3.10 Activation of pepsinogen. After its release into the lumen, pepsinogen is immediately

to more rapid and complete conversion of pepsinogen into pepsin
</p>
<p>frequently found in gastric chyme entering the small intestine. Peptones serve as
potent signals for the release of various hormones, including gastrin and CCK.
</p>
<p>There are two immunologically distinct classes of pepsinogens. Group I
pepsinogens are secreted by the peptic and mucous neck cells of the oxyntic gland,
whereas group II pepsinogens are made in pyloric and Brunner&rsquo;s glands. There
has been considerable interest in pepsinogen as a possible etiologic agent in the
formation of gastric and duodenal ulcers. For example, several studies have shown
that instillation into the stomach of hydrochloride alone does not cause ulceration,
but the inclusion of gastric juice or pepsin with the acid results in ulcer formation. In
many duodenal ulcer patients, both basal and stimulated pepsin secretion are greater
than in normal controls. These observations suggest a possible contributory, albeit
minor, role for pepsin in ulcer formation.
</p>
<p>4 Mucus Bicarbonate Secretion
</p>
<p>4.1 Mucus Secretion
</p>
<p>Mucus is made up of glycoproteins that have very interesting physiochemical
properties. They are extremely hydrophilic and can form gels that contain up to 95%
water. They consist of a polypeptide core and are highly glycosylated at serine
and threonine residues (Fig. 3.11). The glycosidic portion of the molecule makes</p>

hydrophilic and can form gels that contain 95 % water. They consist of a polypeptide core that
is highly glycosylated at serine and threonine residues
</p>
<p>up 80 % the total molecular weight, which usually exceeds 500 kD. It also confers
resistance to proteolytic digestion, an important property since mucus appears to
protect the stomach against acid-pepsin damage. The non-glycosylated regions of
mucin proteins serve as sites for polymerization, which occurs via disulfide link-
ages. Proteolysis or reduction of these linkages by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Mucomyst)
or dihydrothiothreitol (DTT) depolymerizes mucus molecules, destroying their gel-
like properties and making the glycoproteins soluble.
</p>
<p>Two forms of mucus are found in the stomach, namely a soluble and an insol-
uble form. Insoluble or adherent mucus is a viscous, slippery gel that covers most
of the mucosal surface of the stomach and is continuously secreted by surface and
gastric pit cells. It has an important role in providing protection against acid-peptic
injury (discussed below). Soluble mucin results from the degradation of insoluble
mucus by peptic action. The soluble fraction mixes with and lubricates gastric
chyme during gastric motility. The insoluble fraction forms a semi-impermeant
layer that protects underlying cells from damage by gastric acid (Fig. 3.12). Thus,
the gel slows the permeation of acid from the lumen and bicarbonate secreted from
underlying epithelial cells, establishing a buffer zone where the pH near the surface
of the epithelial cells is in fact alkaline.
</p>
<p>Factors That Affect Mucus Secretion
</p>
<p>Mucus secretion and hence the thickness of the mucus layer can be affected by a
number of neuro-hormonal agents. Cholinergic stimulation, for example, results
in copious release of mucus in the stomach, whereas noradrenergic and adrenergic
neurotransmitters do not appear to influence the function of these cells. Other agents
that stimulate mucus secretion include serotonin and prostaglandins E and F. A
possible contributory factor in aspirin-induced gastric ulceration is the inhibition</p>

<p>of prostaglandin formation resulting in a decrease in the mucus protective barrier. In
addition, peptic ulcers and gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori infection
(see below) may also be caused by compromise of the gastric mucus layer.
</p>
<p>4.2 Bicarbonate Secretion
</p>
<p>A major function of cells at the surface and in gastric pits is the secretion of
bicarbonate, which in conjunction with the mucus layer serves to protect the
gastric epithelium against acid-pepsin damage or called gastric mucosal barrier.
Bicarbonate secretion alone is insufficient to counteract the magnitude of proton
secretion. The mechanism of bicarbonate secretion remains unknown, although
some studies have implicated the presence of a bicarbonate channel or Cl�/HCO3�
</p>
<p>exchange. Bicarbonate production is dependent on carbonic anhydrase activity.
Its transport appears to be active and stimulated by vagal nerves and E-series
prostaglandins.

<p>5 Pathogenesis of Peptic Ulcer Diseases
</p>
<p>5.1 Pathophysiology
</p>
<p>Over the past several decades, the understanding and treatment of acid-peptic
diseases of the stomach have significantly advanced. The original concept of no
acid/no ulcer still appears correct, but is also recognized that the balance between</p>

<p>3 Gastric Physiology 79
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.13 Some factors that are believed to be important for the development of peptic ulcer
disease. The well-being of the gastric mucosa is dependent on protective factors that counteract
the effects of aggressive factors such as acid in pepsin. Agents that are involved in increasing
aggressive factors are shown in the lower left and those that decrease protective factors are shown
on the right
</p>
<p>aggressive and protective factors is critical for maintaining the well-being of the
stomach. Peptic ulcers and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) result
if there is an increase in aggressive factors or a decrease in protective factors
(Fig. 3.13). Aggressive factors include increased acid-pepsin activity stimulated
by smoking (nicotine), excessive gastrin secretion (gastrinoma), and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs have a variety of effects that can
promote ulcer formation, including the inhibition of prostaglandin especially PGE2,
which suppresses acid secretion. Thus, NSAIDs usage may augment the acid-
secretory response to histamine and gastrin. Another important aggressive factor
recently recognized is H. pylori, a small, gram-negative bacterial organism that is
the likely cause of most non-NASID-associated peptic ulcer diseases and gastritis.
In fact, H. pylori now appear to be the most common infection worldwide, found
in both ulcer and non-ulcer subjects. Unlike most bacterial organisms, H. pylori
can survive the harsh acid milieu of the stomach, colonizing the mucus layer of
the gastric antrum. Its ability to survive this environment is due, in part, to the
production of urease, an enzyme that converts urea to NH3, which is used to
buffer HC by forming NH4. Though being not invasive, the organism can elicit
an inflammatory response of the underlying mucosa. How H. pylori elicits this
response is not entirely clear, but elaboration of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin),
toxins, adhesions, and chemotactic substances by the organism has been implicated.
</p>
<p>H. pylori do appear to cause increased basal acid output and meal-related
hypergastrinemia in some subjects, especially patients with duodenal ulcer dis-
ease. The mechanism for increased gastrin release from antral G cells is not clear,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>80 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>but it may involve inhibition of somatostatin release from antral D cells, which is
important for tonically inhibiting gastrin release. After eradication of the organism,
the basal acid output and meal-stimulated hypergastrinemia response appear to
normalize, suggestive of a causative relationship.
</p>
<p>It is intriguing that H. pylori do not cause acid-peptic diseases in everyone. In
fact, a large proportion of carriers appear who have no symptoms or gastric mucosal
abnormalities. This observation underscores the importance of other contributing
factors in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease. Among these, decreases in
mucosal barrier function are thought to be the most important. Several agents and
factors can alter or compromise mucosal-barrier function. H. pylori, for instance,
either by direct effect or through its stimulation of mucosal inflammation, decreases
mucosal-barrier function by altering mucus and bicarbonate secretion and breaks
the gastric epithelial lining. Breaches in mucosal barrier allow acid-pepsin to enter,
further compromising mucosal function and causing tissue injury. Aside from
H. pylori, other factors can also decrease gastric-protective functions. NSAIDs
inhibit arachidonate metabolism by blocking cyclooxygenase activity, thus resulting
in decreased prostanoid formation,which is believed to be important for maintaining
mucus and bicarbonate secretion (see above). Smoking and increased nicotine
exposure may also inhibit mucus and bicarbonate secretion, accounting for the
increased incidence of gastric acid-peptic disorders in smokers.
</p>
<p>5.2 Pharmacological Approaches to the Treatment
</p>
<p>of Peptic Ulcer Diseases
</p>
<p>The management of most peptic ulcer diseases has now moved into the arena
of medical therapy because of the enormous advances made in the development
of effective and safe pharmacological agents (Fig. 3.14). Detailed discussion of
these agents is beyond the scope of this text. The following therefore represents
a brief overview of the classes of compounds that have been used to decrease acid
secretion and/or increase mucosal cyto-protective functions. It should be noted that
the medical treatment of H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease now includes
the concomitant use of antibiotics. In this regard, the most frequent and effective
regimen called &ldquo;triple therapy&rdquo; is the use of either a proton pump inhibitor
(omeprazole) plus two to three antibodies (e.g. amoxicillin and clarithromycin).
Below are some treatments and the proposed mechanisms of action for peptic ulcer
diseases.
</p>
<p>Antacids. Antacids, compounds that neutralize acid, have been the mainstay of
medical therapy. These agents include preparations containing aluminum hydroxide,
calcium carbonate, and magnesium hydroxide. Although these agents are effective
in treating patients with peptic ulcers, they must be taken frequently and in large
quantities, making for poor patient compliance.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3 Gastric Physiology 81
</p>
<p>Fig. 3.14 Some treatments for peptic ulcer disease and the mechanisms of action
</p>
<p>Anticholinergics. In theory, anticholinergics should be included in the medical
treatment of peptic ulcer diseases because they can reduce acid secretion. However,
these agents are companied by a number of side effects that patients find intolerable.
In addition, these agents slow gastric motility, promoting increased contact time
between gastric acid and the gastric mucosa, potentially a confounding factor to
their efficacy.
</p>
<p>H2-receptor antagonists. Histamine appears to be a major regulator of gastric
acid secretion. In fact, in some mammalian species, but to a lesser extent in
humans, histamine mediates the actions of gastrin. Thus, inhibition of actions of
histamine by blocking H2 receptors is an extremely effective way to suppress
gastric acid secretion. Thus, agents such as cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine
work as competitive antagonists and have been clinically effective. Although they
do not completely inhibit gastric acid secretion, their effects on total acid output is
sufficient in most cases to allow the stomach to heal.
</p>
<p>Proton pump inhibitors. Substituted benzimidazoles, such as omeprazole, are
extremely potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. They are weak bases that are
selectively taken up and concentrated by gastric parietal cells. In an acid milieu,
these agents are converted to sulfonamides, which irreversibly bind to &rsquo; subunit
of the HC/KC-ATPase (proton pump). Omeprazole can completely inhibit all acid
secretion. In view of this, the use omeprazole as an acid suppressant is potent (it
binds to the final pathway of acid secretion) and long-lasting (it binds irreversibly
to the HC/KC-ATPase).</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>82 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>Prostaglandin agonists. Prostaglandins, especially of the E and I series, have a
number of actions that make them useful in the treatment of peptic ulcer diseases.
First, these agents inhibit parietal cell secretion, possibly through the activation
of receptors linked to inhibitory G proteins of adenylate cyclase; these results in the
inhibition of effects of histamine on acid secretion. In addition to anti-acid secretory
actions, these agents also appear to have cytoprotective actions. Though the factors
mediating this effect are not well understood, they may involve the stimulation of
mucus and bicarbonate secretion by gastric surface cells.
</p>
<p>Cytoprotective agents. These agents include compounds such as sucralfate and
colloidal bismuth subcitrate that avidly bind to the base of ulcers, physically
providing a protective layer against acid injury. Sucralfate is an octasulfate of
sucrose that is highly, negatively charged, allowing it to interact with positively
charged protein molecules. Colloidal bismuth subcitrate is a complex bismuth salt
of citric acid that has a similar mode of action, especially in an acid milieu. Both
agents have been effective in treating peptic ulcer disease.
</p>
<p>Triple therapy. It is the most frequent and effective regimen that contains either
a proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole) or H2 receptor antagonist plus two
to three antibiotics (e.g. amoxycillin and clarithromycin) for 2 weeks. This sort of
treatment not only heals the ulcers but also prevents the recurrence of ulcers.
</p>
<p>Summary
</p>
<p>&bull; Acid is secreted by the parietal cells which contain the enzymeHC/KC-ATPase
on their apical secretory membranes.
</p>
<p>&bull; The three major stimulants of acid secretion are the hormone gastrin, the
neurocrine Ach, and the paracrine histamine, the latter being released from
ECL cells in response to gastrin and Ach.
</p>
<p>&bull; The gastric mucosal barrier of a normal individual can protect the stomach even
in the elevation of HCl and pepsin levels.
</p>
<p>&bull; When HCO3� and/or mucus are suppressed, the barrier is compromised and
ulceration may occur.
</p>
<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>A 40-year-old man presents to the emergency room with history of episodic, sharp,
epigastric abdominal pain frequently accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He
noted that his vomitus often looked like coffee grounds and that he had been
passing dark-colored, tarry-like stools. He had endured his pain by drinking milk
and taking two aspirins four times a day, but frequently wakes up in the middle
of the night with abdominal pain. His past history is essentially negative, except
that he is a heavy smoker. Because he is anemic and orthostatic (blood pressure
falls when he stands up, indicating vascular volume depletion), he is admitted to
the hospital for treatment and further evaluation. After receiving several units of
blood, he undergoes an endoscopic examination, which reveals large duodenal and
gastric ulcers. A mucosal biopsy is performed and subjected to a Campylobacter-</p>

<p>3 Gastric Physiology 83
</p>
<p>like organisms (CLO) test, a colorimetric assay for the presence of bacterial urease,
a marker of H. pylori (formerly known as Campylobacter pylori). The CLO test is
markedly positive.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What caused the gastric lesions in this patient?
Answer: This patient has peptic ulcer disease that could have been caused
by several factors. Since the patient&rsquo;s symptoms preceded his use of aspirin,
it is likely that his duodenal ulcer was caused by H. pylori infection and per-
haps increased acid secretion stimulated by smoking. Although the pathogenic
mechanisms mediating H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease are not entirely
clear, increased acid secretion and decreased mucosal-barrier function are likely
to be involved. Duodenal and gastric ulcers are, however, also caused by
aspirin. Aspirin and other NSAIDs inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins,
which are important for maintaining mucus and bicarbonate secretion and
barrier function by surface epithelium. As a consequence, mucosal-barrier
function is compromised, and the gastric mucosa becomes vulnerable to acid-
peptic injury. Decreased endogenous production of prostaglandins also results in
increased acid secretion, as prostaglandins may stimulate somatostatin release.
It is also possible that NSAIDs decrease mucosal blood flow by inhibition of
prostaglandin production, further compromising mucosal integrity.
</p>
<p>2. What would you recommend as treatment for this patient?
Answer: The treatment would involve the use of antibiotics, possibly bismuth-
containing compounds (e.g., Pepto-Bismol), and acid-suppressing medica-
tions. Antibiotics are necessary to eradicate H. pylori infection; otherwise, the
rate of ulcer recurrence can be substantial. Bismuth compounds are effective,
possibly by counteracting some of the deleterious actions of H. pylori; acid-
suppression by H2-receptor blockers or proton-pump inhibitors (e.g. Omepra-
zole) can accelerate ulcer healing. Currently, triple therapy with the use of one
proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole) and antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin and
clarithromycin) is the most effective treatment option. The patient should also
be strongly advised to quit smoking, a known risk factor in the development of
peptic ulcer disease, and to stop taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.
</p>
<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>A medical student presents to the emergency room with a 2-day history of probable
viral gastroenteritis, characterized by severe nausea and vomiting. He has been
unable to keep down any fluids and says that he is weak and dizzy (especially when
he stands up). Serum electrolytes are drawn for further assessments.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What kind of metabolic abnormalities would you expect?
Answer: Serum electrolytes showed hypokalemia (low KC), hypochloremia,
and the presence of metabolic alkalosis. These abnormalities arise from two
sources. First, the loss of gastric juices, rich in HC, KC, and Cl�, accounts</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>84 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>for a major part of the metabolic disturbance, especially since the student is
unable to replace them orally. These are ions secreted by parietal cells via
the transport processes present in the luminal or canalicular membrane. The
metabolic abnormalities are further exacerbated by the dehydration of the
student. The contraction of vascular volume activates renal mechanisms, i.e.
activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, important for preserving
volume. As a consequence, water and NaC-bicarbonate are reabsorbed at the cost
of urinary excretion of KC and HC.
</p>
<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A 32-year-old woman presents with severe abdominal pain, weight loss, and
occasional nausea and vomiting. She was diagnosed as having duodenal ulcer
disease on two previous occasions when she presented with identical symptoms.
Since her last episode 2months ago, she has been religiously taking her medications,
which include a histamine H2 blocker and antacids. She denies any history of
smoking or use of NSAIDs. On upper endoscopic examination, several severe
duodenal ulcers are found, some post-bulbar (past the first portion of the duodenum)
and in the jejunum. Stool examination reveals some fat malabsorption and occult
blood.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. Because of the severity of the symptoms, what important blood test should
be drawn?
</p>
<p>Answer: This patient has a rare cause of duodenal ulcer disease. Serum gastrin
levels should be obtained, and in this patient they are found to be profoundly
elevated. With her history of ulcer disease refractory to conventional medical
management, together with increased serum gastrin, a diagnosis of gastrinoma
or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome must be entertained. After an extensive work-
up, this diagnosis is confirmed. Gastrinomas are characteristically slow growing,
and the major immediate morbidity to this patient is related to complications
of severe peptic ulcers, including bleeding, perforation, and obstruction from
duodenal scarring.
</p>
<p>The pathophysiology of this disease involves excessive gastrin secretion
(hypergastrinemia) by a tumor, causing gastric acid hypersecretion. The
increased acid load to the duodenum and jejunum can often exceed the capacity
of the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate. Thus, luminal pH of the proximal
small intestine can be very low and injurious to the mucosa. In addition, the
abnormal luminal pH prevents activation of pancreatic-proenzyme activation
and proper micellar formation. This causes maldigestion of luminal nutrients
and malabsorption, explaining this patient&rsquo;s loss of weight.
</p>
<p>2. How would you medically treat this patient if she refuses surgical
intervention?
</p>
<p>Answer: The mainstay of medical management of this condition is acid secre-
tion suppression. Use of H2-receptor blockers is often inadequate because
they are overwhelmed by the potency of gastrin-stimulated acid secretion. By</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>3 Gastric Physiology 85
</p>
<p>blocking at the final pathway of acid secretion, i.e. using omeprazole to
block the proton pump, acid secretion can often be significantly diminished or
blocked. Alternatively, patients have been effectively treated with Octreotide&reg;,
a somatostatin analog that suppresses the synthesis and release of gastrin by
tumor cells. In addition, Octreotide may inhibit acid secretion by inhibiting
histamine release and parietal cell acid secretion. Finally, it should be noted
that omeprazole is so effective in inhibiting acid secretion in many patients
that it actually causes achlorhydria (complete absence of gastric acid). Because
luminal acid is a negative feedback mechanism for gastrin secretion by antral
endocrine cells, the use of omeprazole can cause increases in serum gastrin levels
(hypergastrinemia) by itself.

<p>Pancreatic Physiology

</p>
<p>1 Introduction to the Pancreatic Functions
</p>
<p>The human pancreas consists of two organs in one structure: the exocrine gland
made up of pancreatic acinar cells and duct cells that produce digestive enzymes
and sodium bicarbonate, respectively; the endocrine gland made up of four islet
cells, namely alpha-, beta-, delta-, PP-, and ipsilon- cells that produce glucagon,
insulin, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, and ghrelin respectively. While the
physiological role of exocrine pancreas (&gt;80 % by volume) is to secrete digestive
enzymes responsible for our normal digestion, absorption and assimilation of nutri-
ents, the endocrine pancreas (&lt;2% by volume) is to secrete islet peptide hormones
for the maintenance of our glucose homeostasis. The pancreatic functions are finely
regulated by neurocrine, endocrine, paracrine and/or intracrine mechanisms. Thus,
dysregulation of these pathways should have significant impacts on our health and
disease. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms by which pancreatic functions
are regulated remain poorly understood.
</p>
<p>Embryologically, the human pancreas originates from two separate out-
growths, designated as the dorsal and ventral buds, from the foregut endoderm
directly posterior to the stomach; it is similar to the pancreas development in
murine. The dorsal bud arises from evagination of the dorsal side of the primitive
duodenum at around 3.75th week of gestation while the ventral bud arises from the
base of the hepatic diverticulum at around 4.5th week of gestation. After undergoing
the rotation of the ventral bud to the right of and then behind the developing

<p>duodenal loop, the dorsal and ventral buds come into contact with one another
and fusion of the two buds occurs at the end of 6th week of gestation. The ventral
bud gives rise to the head and uncinate process of the pancreas while the dorsal
bud forms the remaining portion of the organ. Meanwhile, the ventral bud duct
is also fused with the distal portion of the dorsal bud duct and thus forms the
subsequent duct of Wirsung, the main pancreatic duct which runs through the
entire pancreas. The proximal portion of the dorsal bud duct becomes the future
duct of Santorini, the accessory duct. During the fusion of the two pancreatic buds
at 6th&ndash;7th week of gestation, the pancreatic architecture is observed with tubular
structures surrounded by dense mesenchymal tissues next to the duodenal structure.
The mesenchymal layer probably provides signals to the invading epithelium
that regulates the balanced development of the future endocrine and exocrine
portions of the pancreas. The dual origin of the organ accounts for the regional
differences in the islet cell distribution in adult pancreas. In addition, the arterial
blood supply of the pancreas arises from branches of the splenic, gastroduodenal
and superior mesenteric arteries. Extrinsic neural innervation comes from both
parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers through the splenic subdivisions of the
celiac plexus. These nerves innervate all the major components of the pancreas,
including blood vessels, pancreatic acinar cells, and duct and islet cells.

<p>2 Digestive Enzyme Secretion of the Exocrine Pancreas
</p>
<p>2.1 Synthesis and Exocytosis of Protein by the Pancreas
</p>
<p>Acinus as the Functional Unit of Exocrine Pancreas
</p>
<p>The major functional unit of the exocrine pancreas is the acinus or acini (in pleural),
composed of contiguous, pyramid-shaped glandular cells with their apex facing
the lumen of the acinus (Fig. 4.1). These cells have many noteworthy specialized
features. First, they are highly polarized, having distinct functional and structural
differences in the apical and basolateral plasma-membrane domains. Second, acinar
cells have well developed Golgi and rough endoplasmic reticulum complexes,
essential for the synthesis and storage of secretory proteins. Zymogen or storage
granules can be also found in the apical (luminal side) cytoplasm of the cell, and
they vary in number depending on the stage of development and state of stimulation
by neuronal and hormonal agents. Nuclei are located at the very base of the cell.
</p>
<p>Mechanism of Protein Secretion by the Acinus
</p>
<p>The primary function of the pancreatic acinar cell is to produce large amounts
of digestive enzyme proteins that are eventually transported through the ductal
system into the duodenum to be mixed with intestinal chyme. The cellular events</p>

<p>Fig. 4.3 The process of

enzyme secretion. After an

hormonal stimulus, zymogen
granules move to apical
membrane, fuse with plasma
membrane, and discharge
their contents into the luminal
space by the process of
exocytosis
</p>
<p>bound by a cytosolic protein called the signal-peptide recognition particle (SRP),
which facilitates the binding of the mRNA-ribosomal complex to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) membrane. It does so by recognizing and binding to a specific
ER-membrane receptor or docking protein. Because of the hydrophobicity of the
signal peptide, it enters the internal ER compartment. As translation continues,
the rest of the protein traverses the ER membrane and enters the cisternal space.
The signal peptide is then cleaved off by an enzyme called signal peptidase. The
nascent protein then undergoes several post-translational modifications, including
the formation of disulfide bridges, glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation.
Post-translational processing of secreting proteins is important in folding them
into proper tertiary and quaternary configurations. Within 20&ndash;30 min of their
synthesis, these proteins are transferred to the Golgi complex, where additional
processing of the secretory proteins takes place. These modifications generally
involve the removal of mannose groups from glycoproteins and progressive buildup
to a complex glycosylated form by sequential additions of monosaccharides. These
glycoproteins move from the cis to trans side of the Golgi complex and are
eventually concentrated and packaged into storage granules. The secretory granules
then move by an undefined mechanism to the apical portion of the acinar cell. Upon
an appropriate neural of hormonal stimulus, zymogen granules move to the apical
membrane, fuse with the plasma membrane, and discharge their contents into the
luminal space by the process of exocytosis (Fig. 4.3).
</p>
<p>Regulation of Digestive Enzyme Secretion
</p>
<p>Several intracellular messengers appear to play a role in regulating the secretion of
digestive enzymes. Increases in intracellular calcium are stimulated by agents such
as cholecytokinin (CCK), acetylcholine, bombesin (gastrin-releasing peptide or GRP
is the mammalian equivalent), and substance P. Although receptors on acinar cells
for all these agents have been identified, it is likely that cholinergic muscarinic
receptors are the major pathway for regulation (discussed below). These agents</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4 Pancreatic Physiology 91
</p>
<p>Fig. 4.4 A cellular model showing the regulation of protein secretion by a pancreatic acinar
cell. Upon stimulation by agonists such as cholecystokinin (CCK), secretin, vasoactive intestinal
peptide (VIP), and acetylcholine (ACh), signal transduction pathways are evoked in the pancreatic
acinar cell. ACh and CCK stimulate acinar cell secretion by activating inositol triphosphate
(IP3)/diacyl glycerol (DAG) signaling pathways, thus leading to increased cytosolic Ca2C and
protein kinase C (PKC). Secretin and VIP stimulate secretion by elevating intracellular cAMP,
thereby activating protein kinase A (PKA)
</p>
<p>stimulate phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolism, leading to the formation of inositol
1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) (Fig. 4.4). IP3 activates IP3
receptors of calcium storage organelles, releasing Ca2C and increasing cytosolic
Ca2C. Though being transient, this stimulation serves to trigger a number of more
sustained biochemical and functional events. Increased Ca2C activates calcium-
dependent, constitutively expressed nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which produces
nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine. The activity of this enzyme also appears to be
sensitive to the level of intracellular calcium stores, as depletion of these stores can
independently activate NOS activity. NO then appears to stimulate soluble guanylate
cyclase activity to increase cellular cyclic guanosinemonophosphate (cGMP) levels.
cGMP stimulates increased plasma-membrane permeability to Ca2C to sustain
increased cytosolic Ca2C, possibly through activation of a cGMP-dependent cation
channel or through the action of cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Increases
in cytosolic Ca2C stimulate exocytosis of zymogen granules, probably through
calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. The activation of protein kinase
C by DAG may also play a role in stimulating acinar cell secretion, particularly in
sustaining the effect after receptor activation.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>92 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>Synchronization of Secretory Responses
</p>
<p>Recently, the role of intercellular gap junctions in &ldquo;synchronizing&rdquo; acinar cells of
a functional unit has become evident. Gap junctions provide points of low electrical
resistance and for intercellular permeation by small-charge molecules such as IP3
or Ca2C. Local application of agonists to one region of an acinar unit, for example,
stimulates a regional increase in cellular Ca2C. However, the activation of other
cells of the unit soon becomes apparent, most likely through the propagation of
an activating signal via gap junctions. Physiologically, this intercellular coupling
mechanism provides an effective way to produce a unified secretory response by
the acinar unit.
</p>
<p>The relative importance of the above Ca2C-dependent agents for the physiologi-
cal regulation of pancreatic functions is not entirely clear (see discussion at greater
length later in the chapter). Experimentally, these agents do appear to have different
effects on acinar cell function, even though they all appear to activate PI metabolism.
This could be attributed to differences in their effects on PI metabolism or on
receptor coupling with other transduction pathways. For instance, acetylcholine
and CCK vigorously stimulate IP3 and DAG, the latter eventually desensitizing
both receptors. Bombesin, on the other hand, has far less effect on DAG formation
and does not cross-desensitize receptor activation by CCK or acetylcholine. As
another example, CCK, but not acetylcholine, has trophic effect on pancreatic
acinar cells. This may arise from CCK-receptor coupling with the phospholipase
D pathway, which causes the formation of phosphatidic acid and choline, important
for mediating CCK trophism.
</p>
<p>Agents such as secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) also stimulate
acinar cell secretion, apparently through the activation of adenylate cyclase and
increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Although the exact mecha-
nisms that result in enzyme secretion are not well understood, cAMP-dependent
protein kinases are probably involved. The physiological role of cAMP-mediated
agonists in regulating acinar cell functions is also not well characterized, although
it is believed to be less important than calcium-mediated agonists. However, these
agents do appear to augment or potentiate the actions of Ca2C-mediated agonists
(Discussion below).
</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that microtubules or microfilaments of the actin-
myosin system play an important role in the movement of secretory granules to the
site of exocytosis. For example, cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of the microfilament
system, inhibits the exocytic process. After discharge of the contents of the zymogen
granules, excess membrane can be retrieved by the cell and reutilized. Several
lines of evidence suggest that this reutilization process involves endocytosis and
relocation of these internalized membranes to the trans side of the Golgi complex
and to lysosomes.</p>

</p>
<p>2.2 Protein Secretion Essential for Digestion
</p>
<p>The exocrine pancreas makes and secretes a variety of proteins, most of which are
essential for digestion and absorption of ingested nutrients (Fig. 4.5). However,
if these proteins were secreted as active enzymes within the parenchyma of the
pancreas, the consequences would be potentially disastrous, as extensive tissue
destruction would result (i.e. autodigestion). To prevent autodigestion, the pan-
creas protects itself in several ways. First, all potentially harmful enzymes are
made in an inactive or proenzyme form and are packaged in zymogen granules
within acinar cells. Secreted enzymes remain inactive until their reach the duodenal
lumen (Fig. 4.6a). Second, in the duodenum, trypsinogen, a major proteolytic
enzyme, is converted to active trypsin by an enzyme, called enterokinase, a brush-
border enzyme expressed by duodenal mucosa. Trypsin catalyzes the activation of
more trypsin through hydrolysis of the N-terminal hexapeptide of the trypsinogen
molecule, thus rapidly accelerating the entire process. Active trypsin is also essential
for activation of several other proteolytic and lipolytic pancreatic enzymes. Thus, the
activation site for potentially destructive enzymes is geographically removed from
the pancreas and compartmentalized within the duodenal lumen (Fig. 4.6b). Finally,
acinar cells make trypsin inhibitor, which is packaged with trypsinogen in zymogen
granules. Its role is to activate small amount of trypsin that may form within cells or
the body of the pancreas.</p>

other proteolytic and lipolytic pancreatic enzymes. (b) Mechanisms for preventing autodigestion
are shown
</p>
<p>Pancreatic juice contains several kinds of hydrolytic enzymes capable of
digestive micronutrients (proteins, peptides, fats, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids)
into their basic subunits. Proteolytic enzymes make up almost 80 % of all protein
found in pancreatic juice (Fig. 4.5b). These include endopeptidases (cleaving
internal peptide linkages) such as trypsin and exopeptidases (cleaving from ends
of proteins) such as carboxypeptidases. Other enzymes include nucleases, amylase
(digestion of carbohydrates), and those involved in lipid digestion such as lipase,
phospholipase A2, and carboxylesterase. The functional aspects of these enzymes
will be discussed in greater depth in the sections on nutritional physiology.
</p>
<p>3 Fluid and Electrolyte Transport of the Pancreas
</p>
<p>The basal volume of pancreatic secretion is estimated to be 0.2&ndash;0.3 mL/min,
although, when stimulated, pancreatic secretion can reach 4.0&ndash;4.5 mL/min. The
daily output of pancreatic juices into the duodenal lumen in humans is approx-
imately 2.5 L/day. The fluid secreted by the pancreas represents the combined
secretions of both duct and acinar cells, but the compositions of these secretions
differ significantly. Acinar cells secrete a plasma-like fluid that is predominantly</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 4.7 Difference in ionic composition of ductular and acinar fluid. Acinar secretion is a plasma-
like fluid that is predominantly sodium chloride. Ductular secretion is predominantly sodium
bicarbonate
</p>
<p>sodium chloride (Fig. 4.7). The rate of acinar cell fluid secretion is dependent on
the rate of enzyme secretion, and the maximal flow rate is much less than that seen
in ducts. The primary function of acinar cell fluid secretion therefore is to transport
secreted enzymes into the duct system.
</p>
<p>Duct cells, on the other hand, secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid, at a considerably
variable flow rate of 0&ndash;4.0 mL/min depending on the state of pancreatic stimulation.
The purpose of the alkaline secretion is to neutralize gastric acid that enters the
duodenum, a process essential for achieving optimal conditions for pancreatic
enzyme activity. Inadequate bicarbonate secretion with failure to reach a neutral
liminal pH, as occurs in chronic pancreatitis, contributes to maldigestion of
ingested nutrients seen in this condition.
</p>
<p>3.1 Cellular Mechanism for Ductal Bicarbonate Secretion
</p>
<p>The cellular mechanisms for bicarbonate secretion by duct cells have been partially
elucidated (Fig. 4.8). Briefly, bicarbonate is derived from carbonic acid, which
is formed from carbon dioxide and water diffusing in from the interstitial side.
Carbon dioxide derived from metabolism is believed to account for less than 5 %
of bicarbonate in pancreatic juice. Carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the production of</p>

<p>Fig. 4.8 Mechanism of active bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic duct cells. Note that the
recycling of Cl� at the luminal membrane through the cyclic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
(CFTR) transporter appears to be important for sustained bicarbonate secretion
</p>
<p>HCO3� and HC from carbonic acid. HCO3� is then transported across the luminal
plasma membrane by a HCO3�/Cl� exchanger. The major source of luminal Cl�
</p>
<p>is now believed to be from the concomitant secretion of the anion via a luminal-
membrane Cl� channel. This channel is regulated by cAMP-dependent protein
kinase or cystic fibrosis trans-membrane regulator (CFTR) protein, which is
defective in cystic fibrosis. The recycling of Cl� is, therefore, a major factor in
determining HCO3� secretion. Inhibition of Cl� channel activity will decrease
HCO3� secretion. This may explain why pancreatic insufficiency develops in
some cystic fibrosis patients, as it results from defective ductular secretions. In
such a condition, proteinaceous acinar secretions become concentrated and their
precipitation can potentially cause blockage and destruction of pancreatic ducts.
</p>
<p>Protons generated during the production of HCO3� must be rapidly transported
out of the cells or cell pH would drop precipitously. This occurs at the basolateral
membrane through two different mechanisms. One involves NaC/HC exchange,
although it is estimated that the capacity of this pathway is limited especially during
maximal HCO3� secretion. Therefore, the presence of an HC/KC-ATPase (proton
pump) in the basolateral membrane may provide an alternative and perhaps primary
mechanism for rapid proton extrusion. This proton pump is different from the one
found in parietal cells of the stomach, being functionally more analogous to proton
pumps found in the kidney and distal colon. NaC/KC-ATPase is also present in the
basolateral membrane, necessary for producing favorable electrochemical gradients
for Cl� secretion. NaC, some KC, and water accompany HCO3� secretion, mostly
entering the duct lumen by passive paracellular diffusion, their rate of transport
determined by prevailing electrochemical and osmotic forces.</p>

composition and
concentration of pancreatic
juice with secretory rate
</p>
<p>3.2 Modifications of Electrolyte Composition
</p>
<p>Considerable modifications of the pancreatic-juice electrolyte composition occur
as secretory rates change. At low flow rates, pancreatic fluid is mostly sodium
chloride, with small amounts of KC and HCO3� (Fig. 4.9). However, as flow rates
increase, the concentration of HCO3� increases and a reciprocal decrease in those
of Cl� is observed. It is important to note that NaC and KC concentrations, the
two major cations in pancreatic juice, are not affected by flow rate. Although the
mechanisms underlying the rate-dependent alterations in anion composition are
not fully understood, several possible explanations have been offered. First, the
final concentration of HCO3� in pancreatic juices depends on the net HCO3�/Cl�
</p>
<p>exchange in pancreatic ducts. At low rates, pancreatic juice has greater contact
time with ducts, sufficient for ample HCO3�/Cl� exchanger to occur. Pancreatic
fluid becomes more Cl�-rich. At faster flow rates, contact time is insufficient for
passive HCO3�/Cl� exchanger, and secretions remain HCO3� -rich. An alternative
mechanism involves the proportions of duct and acinar fluids that are admixed.
Acinar fluid is mostly sodium chloride and the maximal flow rate is substantially
lower than the maximal flow rate observed in duct cells. At low flow rates, HCO3�
</p>
<p>concentration of pancreatic juice approaches that of duct cell fluid as it becomes the
contributor to the total volume.
</p>
<p>3.3 Regulation of Electrolyte and Water Secretion
</p>
<p>Electrolyte and water secretion by the pancreas is regulated by neural and hor-
monal agents. The major stimulant for sodium bicarbonate and water secretion is
secretin. This 27-amino-acid peptide is structurally similar to vasoactive intestinal
peptide (VIP), and both hormones are known to stimulate adenylate cyclase
in duct cells isolated from the pancreas. The mode whereby cAMP induces</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>98 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>electrolyte secretion probably involves critical phosphorylation events by cAMP-
dependent protein kinase (A-kinase). As mentioned above, A-kinase regulation
of the apical membrane Cl� channel (CFTR) may regulate bicarbonate secretion.
Several inhibitors of fluid and electrolyte secretion by the pancreas have also been
identified. These include the tetradecapeptide somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide
(released by a meal and apparently under vagal cholinergic control), glucagon, and
possibly peptide YY. Prostaglandins, particularly those of the E series, have been
shown to have inhibitory action on pancreatic bicarbonate fluid secretion in vivo.
This is believed to be an indirect effect mediated by the effects of these agents on
pancreatic blood flow.
</p>
<p>4 Organismal Regulation of Pancreatic Exocrine Secretion
</p>
<p>The amount of pancreatic enzymes in the fluid and the timing of their release are
critical for the efficient digestion of micronutrients as they enter the duodenum.
The pH of gastric chyme must also be quickly neutralized for several reasons.
First, acid-pepsin damage to the duodenal mucosa must be prevented. Second,
neutral pH is optimal for pancreatic-enzyme activation and function. Finally, neutral
pH increases the solubility of bile acids and fatty acids. The mechanisms for
maintaining intraluminal pH at or near neutral values are so efficient that only the
very proximal duodenum is normally exposed to pH values below 6. To achieve
this level of fine control, the timing and extent of pancreatic secretions must be
closely integrated with luminal events and digestive demands. The regulation
of pancreatic function can be divided into three phases: cephalic, gastric, and
intestinal. These phases are defined on the basis of where the stimulant acts.
</p>
<p>4.1 Cephalic-Phase Pancreatic Secretion
</p>
<p>The cephalic phase of pancreatic secretion results from central integration of
stimuli such as sight and smell of food or eating food. Sham feeding, for instance,
can stimulate up to 50 % maximal secretion. These stimuli activate efferent vagal
impulses that stimulate the secretion of enzymes and bicarbonate (Fig. 4.10a). This
action is partially mediated by cholinergic fibers but may also involve peptidergic
neurons.
</p>
<p>4.2 Gastric-Phase Pancreatic Secretion
</p>
<p>This phase is initiated by the distention of the stomach by food and by the
presence of amino acids and peptides in the lumen (Fig. 4.10b). These stimuli</p>

<p>Fig. 4.10 Cephalic and gastric phases of pancreatic exocrine regulation. Meal-stimulated pancre-
atic secretions are illustrated. (a) Cephalic phase and (b) gastric phase
</p>
<p>activate vagovagal reflexes and gastrin release to stimulate predominantly pancreatic
enzyme secretion. Vagotomy will abolish most of these effects. This phase is
probably the least important, accounting for less than 10 % of meal-stimulated
pancreatic secretions. Pancreatic bicarbonate secretion is also relatively unaffected
by stimuli evoked during the gastric phase.
</p>
<p>4.3 Intestinal-Phase Pancreatic Secretion
</p>
<p>The intestinal phase of pancreatic secretion is physiologically and quantitatively the
most important (Fig. 4.11). It is initiated by the entry of gastric chyme into the
intestinal lumen and is primarily mediated by cholinergic reflexes and the release of
cholecystokinin (CCK) and secretin. CCK and secretin are made by endocrine cells
of the upper small bowel and their release stimulated by both the composition and
quantity of food. Luminal fatty acids, for instance, stimulate CCK release, saturated
fatty acids being more potent than unsaturated ones. Additionally, relative potency
of fatty acids correlates with chain length, i.e. C18&gt; C12&gt;C8. Neutral triglycerides
do not stimulate pancreatic secretion unless lipolysis occurs. It is also believed
that there are specific receptors for amino acids or oligopeptides on the small
intestinal cells capable of eliciting a neural or hormonal response. Stimulation of the</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 4.11 Intestinal phase of pancreatic exocrine regulation. This phase of pancreatic secretion is
physiologically and quantitatively the most important. It begins with entry of gastric chyme into the
intestinal lumen and is primarily mediated by cholinergic enteric neurons. Ultimate stimulation of
acinar secretion is mediated by vagal efferents from the vagal center of the central nervous system
</p>
<p>sensory receptors causes the release of peptides such as CCK, secretin, and gastric
inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which are crucially involved in activating the second
phase of digestion involving coordination of hepatic, biliary, intestinal, gastric, and
pancreatic functions.
</p>
<p>Regulation of Release of CCK
</p>
<p>CCK release from duodenal endocrine cells is stimulated by the presence and
composition of luminal contents. Until recently, it was believed that CCK stimulated
acinar cell secretion via an endocrine action, i.e. entry into the blood circulation and
stimulation of distinct CCK receptors expressed by pancreatic acinar cells. However,
this notion now appears to be incorrect. In fact, the physiological actions of
CCK are predominantly paracrine, involving afferent cholinergic enteric neurons.
Administration of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine or the perivagal or
mucosal application of the sensory neurotoxin capsaicin significantly decreases
CCK-stimulated pancreatic acinar cell secretion. These findings place into question
on the physiological significance of CCK receptors expressed by pancreatic acinar
cells. Although it is possible that these represent a second line of regulation, the
issue remains unresolved.</p>

</p>
<p>Regulation of Release of Secretin
</p>
<p>Increases in secretin stimulated by gastric acid entering the duodenum are tightly
controlled and proportional to luminal pH (Fig. 4.12). As a consequence, pancreatic
bicarbonate secretion is always proportional to the luminal acid load. At present,
the mechanism for this process is believed to involve secretion of secretin by
duodenal endocrine cells into the blood circulation, although an intermediary
role of enteric neurons has not been fully explored. Through an endocrine action,
secretin stimulates specific receptors expressed by pancreatic duct cells, initiating
bicarbonate secretion. In addition, secretin appears to inhibit gastric acid secretion
and motility, allowing time for intestinal digestion before the next bolus of gastric
chyme is delivered to the small intestine.
</p>
<p>Feedback Mechanism for Pancreatic Secretion
</p>
<p>The concept of feedback regulatory mechanisms for pancreatic secretions has
long been based primarily on studies in rats. Removal of pancreatic proteases
from the intestinal lumen or blocking intraluminal proteolytic activity results in
stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion. The strongest evidence in support of
this hypothesis comes from rats in which bile and pancreatic juices are diverted
from the intestine. Intestinal perfusion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase
suppresses CCK release and the pancreatic-enzyme secretory response. Conversely,
perfusions with amylase or lipase have no effect. Inactivated proteolytic enzymes
are ineffective, indicating that the inhibitory action of proteases is due to their
proteolytic activity. The precise mechanism by which these proteases inhibit
pancreatic secretion is still unknown. Recent studies have suggested that a protease-
sensitive protein called CCK-releasing peptide is secreted by the proximal small
intestine in response to meal-stimulated CCK release from duodenal endocrine cells.
During a meal, luminal proteins are the dominant targets of pancreatic protease</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>102 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>activity, making more CCK-releasing factor available for stimulating mucosal
endocrine cells. As protein digestion approaches completion, progressively more
CCK-releasing peptides become substrates for hydrolysis, reducing the stimulus
for more CCK release. During the fasting state, stimulated secretion of the CCK-
releasing peptide ceases, and residual peptide in the lumen is rapidly degraded.
</p>
<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>The parents of a small infant bring their child in for evaluation of abnormal bowel
movements characterized by loose, bulky, extremely malodorous, and oily stool.
The child has failed to gain weight over the past several months and was recently dis-
charged from the hospital for a pulmonary infection. A sweat test is consistent with
the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF). Stool examination reveals the presence of fat.
Questions
</p>
<p>1. What GI complication of CF does this child have?
Answer: CF is the most common lethal genetic disorder of Caucasians. The
genetic basis is now well understood and involves the inheritance of a defective
gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The CFTR
gene encodes for a membrane protein that appears to be a cAMP-regulated
C1� channel, although it may have other functions as well. The clinical
manifestations mainly involve pulmonary infections and complications of the
GI tract. Patients typically have abnormal sweat electrolytes, characterized by
abnormally elevated levels of NaC and Cl�. Although several mutations of
CFTR have been described, the most common involved is the deletion of three
nucleotides encoding a phenylalanine at position 508. This causes failure of
CFTR to be inserted in the plasma membrane and defective regulation by cAMP-
dependent protein kinase.
</p>
<p>CFTR is now recognized to be important in the pathways that mediate
pancreatic bicarbonate secretion as discussed in this chapter. The failure of its
membrane insertion and activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase prevents
recycling of Cl� required for vectorial bicarbonate secretion. As a consequence,
CF patients have diminished ductal secretion that impairs the ability of the
pancreas to move pancreatic zymogens to the duodenal lumen. Although the
precise pathogenic mechanisms causing pancreatic insufficiency in 85&ndash;90 %
of CF patients are not known, it is possible that the ductal inspissation of
pancreatic juices and activation of zymogens may lead to ductal obstruction,
inappropriate activation of pancreatic enzymes, and tissue injury.
</p>
<p>2. How does pancreatic exocrine insufficiency affect the patient?
Answer: CF can be accompanied with pancreatic insufficiency that causes
maldigestion (see why below) and malabsorption of nutrients (discussed in
greater detail in the nutritional physiology chapters). The pancreas has a large
functional reserve, as demonstrated by the fact that significant maldigestion in
humans with chronic pancreatitis does not occur until the maximal pancreatic
secretory capacity for enzyme drops to less than 10 % of normal. In addition to</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>4 Pancreatic Physiology 103
</p>
<p>the loss of pancreatic enzyme output (due to tissue destruction), inadequate
bicarbonate secretion by the pancreas results in failure to adequately neutralize
the pH of gastric chyme. Thus, luminal conditions for activation of pancreatic
zymogens (best at neutral pH) and micellar formation (necessary for fat digestion
and absorption) are suboptimal. This explains this child&rsquo;s fatty stools and failure
to gain weight.
</p>
<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>A 5-year-old boy presents with a history of growth retardation and bulky, oily,
malodorous stools. Although he has no history of pulmonary infections, a sweat test
for CF is ordered; it is found to be normal. Peroral biopsy of the duodenal mucosa
is also normal, and bacterial overgrowth of the bowel is ruled out by a number of
diagnostic tests. Because of the extremely high content of stool fat (20 g/day), the
possibility of pancreatic insufficiency is entertained. The serum amylase level and
imaging studies of the pancreas, however, are normal. Finally, studies to determine
the exocrine function of the pancreas are performed. Bicarbonate secretion stim-
ulated by administration of intravenous secretin is found to be normal. However,
examination of duodenal contents reveals very low trypsin activity.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What might be the underlying problem of this patient?
Answer:When the pancreatic juice is further analyzed, it appears to have normal
protein content, arguing against a problem with pancreatic enzyme production or
secretion. However, activities of all pancreatic enzymes are low, suggesting a
failure in their activation. This is confirmed, as most zymogens are still found
to be in their inactive, proenzyme form. A mucosal biopsy is performed again
and tested for the presence of enterokinase, which is found to be absent. Thus,
this child has a congenital absence of brush-border enterokinase, which is
required for activation of trypsinogen to trypsin (see below). Trypsin in turn
activates all other proenzymes of pancreatic juice.
</p>
<p>2. How can you treat this patient?
Answers: With oral replacements of enterokinase, the child rapidly gains
weight and no longer has intestinal symptoms.
</p>
<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A 58-year-old woman is found to have a slightly elevated 24 hour stool fat content
(7 g/day). She is otherwise asymptomatic. She had a history of having a truncal
vagotomy 20 years ago for peptic ulcer disease.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. In a patient who has had a vagotomy (surgical interruption of the vagus
nerve to the gut), what would be the mechanisms involved in decreased
</p>
<p>pancreatic secretion thus fat maldigestion and malabsorption?
</p>
<p>Answer 1: Traditionally, the actions of CCK and possibly secretin on pancreatic
function were thought to be mediated by a hormonal pathway. However, recent</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>104 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>studies of humans and animals have dispelled this notion. It is now believed that
the vagal nerve is essential for mediating CCK-stimulated acinar-cell zymogen
secretions (and possibly secretin-stimulated bicarbonate secretion from ducts).
CCK is released by endocrine cells of the duodenal mucosa in response to
luminal fat and proteolytic products. CCK then stimulates afferent vagal fibers
that in turn initiate an effector response emanating from the vagal nuclei of the
brainstem. Efferent vagal stimulation thus appears to account for the majority of
stimulated acinar cell secretion.
</p>
<p>Critical thinking:
</p>
<p>Small amounts of pancreatic enzymes normally escape from the gland into the
plasma, and those that are absorbed across the intestinal epithelia likewise enter
the plasma. Because they are of low molecular weight, they appear in the urine.
Amylase, for example, will enter the plasma when there is ductal obstruction or
rupture or pancreatic destruction. The enzyme is filtered through the glomerular
filtration apparatus and along with other proteins is partially reabsorbed by the renal
tubules.A rise in urine amylasewill result from increased liberation of the enzyme
from the pancreas or from reduced reabsorption by the renal tubule. Hence the
enzyme has been useful in making the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Elevated urine
amylase is particularly significant in a diagnosis of pancreatitis when the renal
clearance of amylase far exceeds the renal clearance of creatine (a crude measure
of glomerular filtration rate).

<p>Intestinal Water and Electrolyte Transport
</p>
<p>Eugene B. Chang and Po Sing Leung
</p>
<p>1 Introduction to Gut Absorption of Fluid and Electrolyte
</p>
<p>In addition to digestion and absorption of nutrients, the intestinal tract has several
essential functions, including a barrier to the outside environment, synthesis of
secreted proteins, such as those required for fat absorption and immunoglobulin
secretion, and elimination of waste products, as well as transport of salt and water.
Failure to efficiently absorbing water and electrolyte, it will lead to dehydration
and electrolyte imbalance. Most of these processes are dependent on the specialized
mucosal functions and structural requirements discussed in this chapter. Particular
emphasis will be placed on aspects of intestinal epithelial biology and the transport
of fluid and electrolytes. The discussion of other mucosal functions such as digestion
and absorption of nutrients will be covered in subsequent chapters in Part Two of
this book.
</p>
<p>The cells relevant to intestinal water and electrolyte transport can be roughly
divided into two major groups: those involved in electrolyte transport and those
having predominantly a regulatory role, i.e. integrating the functional responses of
the first group. This organization of the intestinal mucosa is extremely important
considering the type of work it must perform. The absorptive epithelium of the
intestine receives a luminal load averaging 9 L/day (Fig. 5.1). Approximately 2 L
come from oral ingestion and 7 L from endogenous secretions from a variety of

<p>sources including the salivary glands, gastric juices, bile, pancreas, and enteric
secretions. The endogenous secretions provide the necessary conditions, such as
pH, aqueous medium, salts, and osmolality, for rapid and efficient digestion and
absorption of nutrients and electrolytes. Of the 9 L presented to the intestinal
mucosa each day, approximately 8.8 L or more are absorbed, resulting in less
than 200 g/day of stool output (assuming the subject is eating a typical West-
ern, low-roughage diet). Therefore, the gut is capable of absorbing greater than
98 % of the fluid load it is presented, making it a highly efficient organ for
absorption of water and electrolytes. However, the gut also has the ability to
adjust to large variations in luminal composition and volumes, especially increases.
Diarrhea, which results when the absorptive capacity of the gut is exceeded,
infrequently occurs under physiological circumstances. This can be attributed to
the gut&rsquo;s ability to fine tune its absorptive and secretory processes, achieved
through its intricate and often redundant regulatory mechanisms and by input from
extra-intestinal sources. If any aberrations occur in the homeostatic regulation
of ion-transport functions, stool output could exceed 200 g/day and diarrhea
would result.</p>

<p>5 Intestinal Water and Electrolyte Transport 109
</p>
<p>2 Organization of the Intestinal Mucosa
</p>
<p>2.1 Intestinal Cells and Factors Involved in Water
</p>
<p>and Electrolyte Transport
</p>
<p>The transport of water and electrolytes by the intestinal mucosa involves several
types of cells and structural relationships. Important components of this process are
discussed below.
</p>
<p>Epithelial Cells
</p>
<p>Epithelial cells represent the largest population of cells of the intestinal mucosa, of
which there are four major types: (1) columnar, polarized epithelial cells, capable
of vectorial transport of nutrients and electrolytes; (2) mucosal endocrine cells; (3)
mucus producing and secreting goblet cells; and (4) defense-producing Paneth cells
located at the base of intestinal crypts (Fig. 5.2). The latter two cell types will not be
discussed, as their role in intestinal water and electrolyte transport is questionable
or unknown. Gut epithelial cells emanate from a stable stem-cell population located
near the base of the crypt and, with the exception of Paneth cells, differentiating as
they migrate up the crypt-villus axis. As the cells reach the villus tip, they undergo
apoptosis (physiologically programmed cell death) and are sloughed off into the
lumen, with the entire sojourn taking 3&ndash;5 days. As cells undergo crypt-to-villus
differentiation, significant changes in cellular morphology are evident (Fig. 5.3a),
characterized by increasing polarity of the cells, differences in cellular organelle
components, development of the microvillus membrane and terminal web, and
alterations in other cytoskeletal and tight-junctional structural features. The latter
are accompanied by decreases in junctional permeability, a property that may arise
out of necessity to achieve efficient absorption of nutrients and electrolytes with
a minimum of back flux. The regional differences in tight-junction permeability
are reflected by the number of intercellular strands that make up the tight junctional
complex. The number of strands in this anastomosing network in villus cells is much
greater than in the crypt cells, making the villus regions more impervious to passive
diffusion of water and electrolytes.
</p>
<p>Alterations in functional characteristics along the crypt-villus axis also occur
(Fig. 5.3b). Absorption and secretion of water and electrolytes are two distinct
processes in the gut that take place in the villus and crypt cells, respectively.
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), a cyclic adenosine monophos-
phate (cAMP) regulated Cl� channel involved in anion secretion, is predominantly
found in crypt cells, consistent with a secretory role. As these cells become
villus cells, the protein synthetic and secretory capabilities increase, reflected by
increased development of the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum complex and numbers
of secondary endosomal vesicles. Properties of nutrient absorption and digestion
appear, exemplified by increases in brush-border hydrolase activities, glucose</p>

<p>Fig. 5.2 Absorptive and secretory flows that determine the next fluid movement of the intestinal
epithelial cells. There are four major types of epithelial cells making up the intestinal mucosa:
enterocytes, endocrine cells, goblet cells, and Paneths cell. With the exception of Paneths cells,
cells originating from the proliferative zone migrate up the villus axis and mature during the
process, which eventually have a turnover rate of 3&ndash;5 days
</p>
<p>transport and increased surface area of the apical membrane. Thus, the observed
morphological, phenotypical and functional changes assumed by differentiating
villus cells are consistent with their enhanced capacity for absorption of nutrients
and electrolytes.
</p>
<p>Blood Capillaries and Lymphatics
</p>
<p>Blood capillaries and lymphatics have a major role in intestinal water and elec-
trolyte transport. During absorption, for instance, they rapidly remove absorbed
nutrients, water and electrolytes from the interstitium, thereby allowing vectorial
transport to proceed. Similarly, active secretion of water and electrolytes is accom-
panied by increased mucosal blood flow and capillary filtration and by decreased
villus lymph pressure and total lymphatic flow. In each case, in order for efficient
absorption and secretion to occur, the events of mucosal transport, capillary flow,
and lymphatic function must be coordinated. Neural and hormonal agents play a

<p>effect of these agents is to increase delivery of plasma fluid and electrolytes to match
the demands of active intestinal secretion. Another purpose of increased blood flow
during active secretion is to increase tissue delivery of oxygen to meet metabolic
demands.
</p>
<p>Intestinal Motility
</p>
<p>The relationship between intestinal motility andmucosal water and electrolyte trans-
port is extremely complex and incompletely understood. Although the functional
properties of motility and ion transport can be readily studied independently, their
physiological roles in intestinal water nutrient and electrolyte transport in vivo are</p>

<p>very much interdependent. This was recognized as early as 1912 by Babkin and
Ishikawi, who noted that the periodicity of intestinal secretion coincided with that
of intestinal motor activity. Consistent with this notion, there is ample evidence that
enteric reflexes coordinate intestinal water and electrolyte secretion with smooth
muscle contractions (Fig. 5.4). The integration of these responses serves several
important purposes. First, it provides an immediate response to begin the process
of digestion and absorption of luminal contents. Increased net secretion is essential
for providing the aqueous milieu to reach isotonicity and for digestive enzymes
to function properly. Coordinated patterns of intestinal motility ensure that mixing
and propulsive activity of luminal contents proceed appropriately. This mechanical
activity can significantly enhance the absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and water
through several potential mechanisms. Segmentation of the gut helps mix luminal
contents with secretions and digestive juices and increases contact time between
the luminal phase and the absorptive mucosal surface. Increased intestinal motor
contractility is believed to alter the unstirred water layer, present as the result of the
overlying layer of mucus gel. This facilitates diffusion of nutrients and electrolytes
to the transporters of the brush-border membranes.
</p>
<p>Decreased propulsive motor activity may enhance contact time between the
absorptive surface area and luminal contents and is probably the major mechanism
of action of commonly used antidiarrheal agents. In clinical studies of loperamide,
codeine, and the &rsquo;2-receptor agonist clonidine, the predominant proabsorptive effect
of these agents appeared to be due to their ability to increase the &ldquo;enteropooling&rdquo;
capacity of the gut. The net effect of this action is to increase contact time between
luminal fluid and the absorptive surface area.
</p>
<p>2.2 Mucosal Cells Involved in the Regulation
</p>
<p>of Gut Water and Electrolyte Transport
</p>
<p>Mucosal Endocrine Cells
</p>
<p>Endocrine cells are widely distributed in the intestinal mucosa and represent a
major source of active amines and polypeptide hormones important in the</p>

</p>
<p>regulation of fluid and electrolyte transport. Although many of the contents of their
secretory granules are also found in nerve cells of the enteric nervous system, it is
likely these cells have unique and independent role in modulating various mucosal
functions. Like their transporting epithelial counterparts, mucosal endocrine cells
are polarized. Their apical or luminal pole is characterized by tufts of microvilli
and coated vesicles, whereas their secretory granules and nuclei are located at
the basal domain of the cell. These structural characteristics most likely represent
the functional requirements of the cell to sense alterations in luminal content
such as pH, osmolality, and chemical content and initiate an integrated mucosal
response through the release of secretory-granule contents at the basal surface of
the cells. Several peptides, active amines, and other agents appear to modulate
intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport (Fig. 5.5). The regional distribution of these
agents throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract differs markedly. For example, cells
containing gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and secretin are more prominently found</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>114 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>in the stomach and proximal small intestine, whereas neurotensin-containing
cells are largely restricted to the ileum. Serotonin-containing enterochromaffin cells
are found throughout the mucosa but predominantly in the crypt regions, where
they may project basal processes that run subjacent to neighboring epithelial cells
and nerves containing other peptides. Recently, guanylin, the natural endogenous
peptide agonist of the E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) receptor, has been
localized to epithelial (nonclassic endocrine) cells of the colonic mucosa (and
possibly Paneth cells of the human small intestine). Guanylin is released into the
crypt lumen and stimulates luminal receptors on intestinal epithelial cells by a
paracrine action to stimulate net secretion.
</p>
<p>Mucosal endocrine cells most likely regulate intestinal ion-transport functions
through a paracrine action. They can be activated by a variety of luminal and serosal
stimuli. Thus, mucosal endocrine cells probably serve two important functions
relevant to the control of intestinal water electrolyte transport. First, they provide
a means for the mucosa to sense and rapidly respond to alterations in luminal
content and milieu. The stimulated release of hormonal peptides and active amines
causes appropriate changes in ion-transport functions, blood and lymphatic flow,
and intestinal motility. Secondly, they may function as a fine tuning mechanism or
amplifier for modulatory signals received from neural sources.
</p>
<p>Enteric Neurons
</p>
<p>The GI tract is one of the most richly innervated organs of the body and has
two major categories of nerves: the intrinsic or enteric nervous system and the
extrinsic autonomic nervous system consisting of parasympathetic and sympathetic
nerve pathways. Although most postganglionic sympathetic fibers terminate in
enteric ganglia, a few have been reported in close proximity to intestinal epithelial
cells, where they may form actual synapses. Release of norepinephrine from
these neurons stimulates &rsquo;2-adrenergic receptors on the basolateral membranes of
enterocytes, causing increased electroneutral absorption of sodium chloride and
inhibition of anion secretion. Parasympathetic neurons are also believed to be
important in the regulation of intestinal salt and water transport. However, the nature
of vagal postganglionic fibers to the intestine is less well understood. Some fibers
make up interneurons that modulate enteric system tone or responses.
</p>
<p>The enteric nervous system is a dense plexus of efferent, afferent, and interneu-
rons, exceeding in number the neurons of the spinal cord. It is composed of cholin-
ergic and non-cholinergic neurons that regulate numerous mucosal and motor
functions. The number of neurotransmitters found in these nerves is quite large
and includes active amines (such as serotonin and acetylcholine), neuropeptides
(such as substance P, neurotensin, CCK, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, calcitonin
gene-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide and galanin), and purinergic
neurotransmitters (such as adenosine and adenosine triphosphate, ATP). This
tremendous diversity of neurotransmitters is probably required to regulate and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5 Intestinal Water and Electrolyte Transport 115
</p>
<p>coordinate the numerous mucosal and motor functions involved in salt and water
transport. Many of the enteric nervous system neurons are part of programmed
reflexive circuits that can immediately respond to various stimuli. Mucosal sensory
fibers respond to a number of stimuli, including mechanical factor (touch, pressure,
and tension), changes in luminal content and composition (pH, osmolality, and
amino acids), temperature, and pain. These sensory signals are then relayed to
interneurons that rapidly process and sort the signals so that efferent (motor) neurons
(regulating smooth muscle, blood vessel, absorptive and secretory cells, and other
cells of the lamina propria) can produce patterned and coordinated responses for
efficient transport of water and electrolytes. The enteric nervous system plays a
major role in regulating intestinal water and electrolyte transport, as evidenced by
the fact that mucosal and motor functions can proceed independently of extrinsic
neural input.
</p>
<p>Mesenchymal Cells of the Lamina Propria
</p>
<p>Mesenchymal cells of the lamina propria and submucosa play a juxtacrine role
and modulate intestinal mucosal transport, blood flow, and motor functions. They
include many cell types such as sub-epithelial fibroblasts, endothelial cells, mast
cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. Their numbers within the mucosa
vary considerably depending on the species, the region of the intestine, and
the prevailing physiological or pathophysiological circumstances. Although their
relative roles in the physiological regulation of intestinal water and electrolyte
transport have not been established, it is likely that many of these cells play a major
role in causing net secretion, altered motor function, and changes in blood flow
under pathophysiological situations such as mucosal inflammation.
</p>
<p>Many of these cells appear to have important interactions with neural and
epithelial elements within the intestinal mucosa (Fig. 5.6). For example, mast cells,
found throughout the intestinal mucosa and often in close proximity or juxtaposed
to enteric nerve fibers, activate enteric neurons. This serves to amplify and extend
the effects of mast-cell mediators such as histamine. These cells have an important
immunoregulatory role and are involved in the allergic and anaphylactic reactions
to food antigens and helminth parasites, as well as in diseases such as systemic
mastocytosis. The number of inflammatory mediators released by the mast cell is
large and includes agent such as histamine, adenosine, platelet-activating factor
(PAF), serotonin, and arachidonic acid metabolites. Agents such as prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2), adenosine, and serotonin stimulate net intestinal secretion in part by
directly activating epithelial receptors, causing decreased absorption of NaC and
Cl� and activate secretion of anions. However, these agents and others such as
histamine and PGD2 also stimulate net secretion by promoting the release of various
neurotransmitters, thus amplifying or augmenting the overall secretory response.
</p>
<p>Resident tissue macrophages are also prevalent in the intestinal mucosa,
constituting 10&ndash;20 % of the total cell number in the lamina propria. This makes</p>

</p>
<p>the small and large intestine one of the largest repositories of macrophages in
the body. Under steady-state and physiological conditions, there appears to be a
constant turnover of macrophages (on the order of days to weeks), mostly from
the replacement of existing tissue macrophages with incoming monocytes. In the
intestine, the macrophagesmay be conditioned by tissue-specific influences, such as
bacterial products from the lumen (including endotoxin), extracellular matrix, and
cytokines. The continuous exposure to foreign antigens and pathogens, particularly
in the colon, may be important in sensitizing macrophages, allowing them to
rapidly react to various stimuli. Thus, macrophages function as a first-line defense
against pathogens and antigens and are capable of orchestrating and amplifying an
appropriate immune and inflammatory response. The intestinal macrophages are
veritable factories for synthesis and release of numerous immune and inflammatory
mediators. They are a major source of carbon monoxide and 5-lipoxygenase
(5-LO) metabolites and may mediate the secretory effects of many of the secre-
tagogues that are known to activate the arachidonic acid cascade. In response to
numerous immune and inflammatory stimuli, they also elaborate cytokines such as
interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-
</p>
<p>CSF), and other inflammatory mediators such as purinergic agents. Most of these
products have now been shown to affect intestinal water and electrolyte transport
and have potent effects on modifying intestinal motor functions and capillary blood
flow and permeability. Like mast cell products, they have numerous sites and
mechanisms of actions that affect ion transport. These will be discussed later in
the chapter.</p>

<p>5 Intestinal Water and Electrolyte Transport 117
</p>
<p>3 Mucosal Electrolyte Transport Processes
</p>
<p>3.1 Absorptive Pathways for Water and Electrolytes
</p>
<p>Water transport by the intestine is closely coupled with solute movement and is
passive. In theory, water flow could occur by transcellular and paracellular routes,
but the prevailing evidence indicates that water transport by the intestine occurs
through the paracellular pathway. Like other tissues that transport electrolytes,
the intestine has a variety of specialized transport proteins, which can be divided
into three major types (Fig. 5.7).
</p>
<p>Pumps such as sodium pump (NaC/KC-ATPase) and the proton pump (HC/KC-
ATPase) are energy-driven and capable of transporting ions against large elec-
trochemical gradients. In intestinal epithelium, for example, the sodium pump is
essential for establishing and maintaining electrochemical gradients (low intracel-
lular NaC and electronegative membrane potential) that are required for other types
of passive and facilitated transport processes.
</p>
<p>Channel proteins are selective membrane &ldquo;pores&rdquo; for ions such as NaC and
Cl�. Channel transport is dependent on favorable electrochemical gradients, is
often membrane-potential sensitive, and is generally electrogenic, i.e. causing a
potential difference across the epithelial layer that promotes passive diffusion of
a counter ion. For example, electrogenic Cl� secretion in the gut causes a potential
difference (serosa is positive relative to lumen) across the mucosa that promotes
passive transport of NaC, resulting in net sodium chloride secretion.
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.7 Intestinal transport proteins. There are three types of transport proteins that are found in
the plasma membranes of intestinal cells: pumps, channels and carriers (Adapted from American
Gastroenterological Association Teaching Slide Collection 25 &copy;, Bethesda, Maryland; Used with

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>118 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>Carrier transport proteins facilitate transport of ions and nutrients across the
cell membrane, and their transport activity is dependent on existing electrochemical
gradients. Several types of carrier proteins exist in gut epithelium. Uniport carrier
proteins, such as the facilitated glucose transporter GLUT2, mediate the transport of
a single ion or nutrient molecule; symport carrier proteins, such as sodium/glucose
cotransport-1 (SGLT-1) protein, are carriers that simultaneously transport two or
more molecules, often taking advantage of favorable electrochemical gradients for
one molecule to actively transport others. Transport by these carriers occurs only if
all solutes are present. In addition, glucose transport will not occur if an inwardly
directed NaC gradient is absent; antiport carriers, such as the Cl�/HCO3� and
NaC/HC exchangers, exchange one molecule for another.
</p>
<p>Absorptive Pathways for Electrolytes
</p>
<p>NaC and Cl� are avidly absorbed by the intestinal mucosa, albeit differing in
amount and by region-specific transport mechanisms of the gut. Several of these
pathways and their relative distribution along the horizontal axis of the intestine are
illustrated in Fig. 5.8.
</p>
<p>In the small intestine, for example, NaC is in part absorbed by solute-
dependent NaC-cotransport processes that are quantitatively greater in the prox-
imal than in the distal small bowel. In addition, the luminal bioavailability of
nutrients and digestive enzymes is also largest in the proximal small intestine.
Non-nutrient dependent NaC absorption in humans occurs predominantly via
luminal membrane-located, amiloride-sensitive NaC/HC exchangers that are not
coupled to Cl�/HCO3� exchangers in the jejunum, as is the case in the more distal
regions of the bowel (Fig. 5.9). Consequently, NaC absorption is accompanied
by an apparent HCO3� absorption, resulting from extrusion of protons, carbon
dioxide formation, and increased cellular HCO3� secondary to diffusion of carbon
dioxide. Cl� absorption in this region is passive, dependent on transmural potential
differences and concentration gradients.
</p>
<p>In the distal small intestine and proximal colon, NaC and Cl� absorption are
coupled and electroneutral. Although a furosemide-sensitive NaC-Cl� cotransport
protein has been proposed, it is likely that most coupledNaC-Cl� transport is carried
out by the two distinct proteins, NaC/HC exchanger and Cl�/HCO3� exchanger,
which are coupled by the formation of intracellular HCO3� and protons from
carbonic acid (Fig. 5.10). The presence of these carrier proteins has been confirmed
by numerous studies of brush-border membrane vesicles and is further supported
by the findings in patients with familial chloridorrhea, a rare inborn error of
transport manufactured by an absence of Cl�/HCO3� exchanger activity. These
patients develop moderate diarrhea and may have metabolic alkalosis and stool
pH in the acidic range. Luminal perfusion studies demonstrate abnormality in the
ileum and colon, where HCO3� secretion appears to be replaced by HC secretion.
In the ileum and colon, Cl� is also absorbed by a HCO3�-dependent pathways,
probably involving a luminal membrane Cl�/HCO3� exchanger not coupled to
NaC/HC exchanger, as well as by potential difference-dependent diffusion.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 5.8 Intestinal transport pathways for absorption. There are three types: sodium absorption
(a), chloride absorption (b), and potassium absorption (c). These transporters are distributed along
the length of the gut (arrows) (Adapted from American Gastroenterological Association Teaching
Slide Collection 25 &copy;, Bethesda, Maryland; Used with permission)
</p>
<p>In the distal colon, active NaC absorption must occur against very large
electrochemical gradients. To accomplish this, the rectum absorbs NaC by an
electrogenic, amiloride-sensitive NaC channel present in the luminal membrane
(Fig. 5.11). Because this region of the gut has the least paracellular permeability,
back diffusion of ions is minimal, and large potential differences can be maintained.
The latter is necessary for passive absorption of the counter ion Cl�/KC absorption
in the colon, in contrast to its exclusively passive transport in the small intestine,
is actively absorbed predominantly in the recto-sigmoid area. This is probably
mediated by KC/HC exchanger of a luminal membrane HC/KC-ATPase, which
has recently been cloned (Fig. 5.12). This protein has 63 % amino acid homology</p>

chain fatty acids (SCFA). SCFA are products of bacterial metabolism of undigested
complex carbohydrates derived from dietary sources such as fruits and vegetables.
They are produced in large quantities by colonic bacterial flora and in fact represent
the major luminal anions of the region. Although SCFA are believed to have many
important trophic effects on colonic mucosa, they also appear to promote NaC

<p>absorption by the colonic mucosa. Unfortunately, the exact mechanism for NaC-
SCFA absorption remains controversial. Nevertheless, luminal SCFA may play an
extremely important role in aiding colonic water and electrolyte absorption.</p>

<p>3.2 Secretory Pathways for Water and Electrolyte
</p>
<p>Active water and electrolyte secretion serve several important purposes. Its major
physiological role is to provide the aqueous medium for proper digestion and
absorption of luminal nutrients. Intestinal secretion is largely driven by active
secretion of Cl� or HCO3�.
</p>
<p>Secretion of Cl�
</p>
<p>The secretion of Cl�, in particular, has been well characterized and appears
to involve the coordinated actions of four membrane proteins: (1) a</p>

2Cl� co-transporter, (3) KC-selective channels, and (4) the NaC/KC-ATPase,
or sodium pump (Fig. 5.13). Briefly, Cl� enters the cells by the NaC/KC/2Cl�
</p>
<p>co-transporters and exits into the lumen via Cl�-selective channels (one of which
may be cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator channel, CFTR), with the openings
of the channels being modulated by various protein kinases. KC and Cl�, which
accompany Cl� entry into the cell, are recycled across the basolateral membrane by
KC-selective channels and the NaC/KC-ATPase, respectively. NaC secretion that
accompanies active Cl� secretion is a passive process, driven by the trans-epithelial
potential difference resulting from Cl� secretion. Cl� secretions can be regulated
by numerous neurotransmitters and gut peptides (discussed below).
</p>
<p>Secretion of HCO3
�
</p>
<p>In contrast to Cl� secretion, much less is known about HCO3� secretion. In rabbit
ileum, HCO3� secretion appears to be electrogenic and vectorially transported
across the epithelium, rather than generated by the production of HCO3� from
the action of carbonic anhydrase. Furthermore, HCO3� secretion appears to be
dependent on the presence of serosal NaC and is postulated to involve at least
three different transporters: (1) an apical membrane anion-selective (HCO3� and
possibly Cl�) channel; (2) a coupled, electrogenic NaC/HCO3� cotransporter
in the basolateral membrane; and (3) a Cl�/HCO3� exchanger in the apical
membrane. In the distal colon, HCO3� secretion appears to be electroneutral
and may involve a NaC-independent Cl�/HCO3� exchanger located in the apical
membrane. Along with HCO3� secretion, it is important for providing the aqueous
phase for luminal digestion and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5 Intestinal Water and Electrolyte Transport 123
</p>
<p>Secretion of KC
</p>
<p>Active KC secretion is also found throughout the colon, apparently mediated by a
barium-sensitiveKC conductance in the apical membrane. KC enters the basolateral
membrane of the colonocyte via the NaC/KC-ATPase pump, and possibly by the
NaC/KC/2Cl� co-transporter. This is a process that can be stimulated by increases
in cellular cAMP and Ca2C.
</p>
<p>4 Physiological Regulation of Gut Water
</p>
<p>and Electrolyte Transport
</p>
<p>The intestines contribute 12&ndash;14 % of the secretions needed to maintain the chyme
in a fluid state. In addition to allowing for efficient digestion and absorption of
the complex components of mammalian meals, the secretions serve as a conduit
for the luminal delivery of secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) glycoproteins
and for flushing out infectious agents and noxious stimuli. The regulation of
intestinal secretion is multifactorial, involving luminal and systemic influences. It
has long been recognized that simplemechanical stimulation of the gut lumen can
increase secretion. Similarly, chemical stimuli, no matter in the form of the normal
breakdown products of dietary intake, toxigenic elaborations of the microflora, or
noxious chemicals and antigens, elicit secretions. Systemic metabolic changes,
including volume overload, dehydration, and acidosis or alkalosis, also influence
secretion. Finally, in addition to local regulation of neurohumoral factors, there
is increasing evidence that higher centers of the brain have modulatory effect on
intestinal secretion. All these stimuli act on an intricate complex of neural, hormonal
and autocrine modulators in the mucosa and gut wall that govern both basal and
stimulated states of secretion. As described above, these agents act on specific
receptors on the target cells, which can be on either the enterocytes or underlying
neural, vascular, or immune elements.
</p>
<p>4.1 Neurohormonal Agents That Cause Net Intestinal
</p>
<p>Secretion or Increase Net Absorption
</p>
<p>Factors that regulate intestinal epithelial ion-transport properties can be broadly
classified into two groups: the secretagogues and the pro-absorptive agents. As
their names imply, secretagogues cause net accumulation of fluid in the intestinal
lumen by either stimulating active secretory processes and/or inhibiting absorption;
pro-absorptive agents promote absorption by having the opposite effect. The major
secretagogues and pro-absorptive agents known to act on enterocytes are listed in
Fig. 5.5. The source of regulatory agents varies. Some, such as neurotransmitters</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Fig. 5.14 Intracellular
processes mediating
agonist-stimulated net
secretion
</p>
<p>and paracrine hormones, are released locally near the basolateral membrane of
the enterocyte. Other substances, such as guanylin, are released into the lumen,
and substances such as adrenalocorticoids reach the enterocyte via the systemic
circulation. Enterocytes have receptors on both apical and basolateral membranes
and, in the case of the steroids, intracellular receptors as well. In addition to
species and regional differences in receptor distribution, multiple receptor
isotypes for each neurotransmitter/hormone appear to exist. Likewise, several
histamine-, muscarinic-, and adrenergic-receptor subtypes have been identified
in different regions of the gut. The type of ligand-receptor interaction is a major
determining factor of the duration of the response. Thus, the effects of a number of
calcium-dependent secretagogues and prostaglandins are short-lived, and some
of these are due to receptor-associated tachyphylaxis. These short-lived responses
are probably crucial for dealing with the minute-by-minute challenges in the gut
milieu. In contrast, the steroid-mediated responses are much longer lived. For
example, in the distal colon, they act through specific intracellular receptors in the
enterocytes initially to increase the recruitment of transporters to the epithelium by
promoting the synthesis of various proteins needed for transport; they include apical
membrane NaC channels NaC/HC exchange, as well as increasing the number of
NaC, KC-ATPase pumps in the basolateral membrane to provide the necessary
driving force for transport. Long-term changes are more beneficial in an adaptation-
type of response, as seen in exposure to a low-sodium diet or dehydration.
</p>
<p>Mechanisms of Regulation of Ion Transport
</p>
<p>As with many types of cells, a number of signal transduction pathways are involved
in the regulation of ion transport. Secretagogues act mainly by stimulating one
of the classic signal transduction cascades; the pathways dependent on cAMP,
cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), Ca2C, or phosphatidylinositol (PI)
(Fig. 5.14). These second messengers activate their respective protein kinases that
phosphorylate proteins directly involved in ion transport or critical in regulating</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5 Intestinal Water and Electrolyte Transport 125
</p>
<p>Fig. 5.15 Synergistic effect of intracellular mediators that regulate intestinal electrolyte transport
</p>
<p>transport activities. The mechanisms of action of the pro-absorptive agents vary
and include an activation of the inhibitory G protein (Gi) cascade, the inhibitory
arm of the adenylate cyclase cascade, and the PI cycle. Themechanism of activation
of these second messengers could also influence the duration and type of the
biological response. This is best exemplified by comparing the effects of cholera
toxin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and prostaglandins, all three of which
stimulate secretion via the cAMP cascade. The activation of secretion by cholera
toxin involves an essentially irreversible covalent modification of the stimulatory
G protein (Gs)-type of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins. Activated
Cl� secretion is only &ldquo;shut off&rdquo; when the enterocyte is sloughed off at the end of
its normal life span. Secretagogues such as VIP can cause sustained stimulation
of secretion in vitro; secretion returns to baseline as the hormone/neurotransmitter
is degraded. The effects of prostaglandins are limited by receptor tachyphylaxis.
The general dogma is that second messengers activate specific protein kinases to
cause a biological effect and that endogenous phosphoprotein phosphatases reverse
this effect to return the system to the basal state. There is considerable evidence
to indicate a role for protein phosphorylation in regulating intestinal ion transport,
but recent evidence suggests that there may be direct, non-kinase activation of
Cl� channels by cyclic nucleotides as well. Although a regulatory role for protein
phosphatases in signal transduction gains acceptance, to our knowledge, a role for
them as a primary trigger of intestinal ion transport has not yet been demonstrated.
</p>
<p>Considerable cross-talk also exists among the different signaling mechanisms
and among different steps of the same signaling pathway. Two examples are
provided here and illustrated in Fig. 5.15. Synergistic actions between cAMP and
Ca2C-mediated secretion, as well as cGMP (STa) and Ca2C-mediated secretion,
have been demonstrated. In both cases, the effects of the combined additions are</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>126 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>greater than the effects of each agent added alone. In contrast, phorbol esters,
activators of protein kinase C, do not have any effect when added alone but attenuate
cAMP-mediated Cl� secretion.
</p>
<p>Regulation of ion transport by intestinal epithelial cells must involve the
coordination of transport processes at the apical and basolateral membranes.
For example, it is known that NaC/HC exchangers are present in both mem-
brane domains. Simultaneous activation of these transporters would result in
counterproductive actions and ineffective absorption of NaC. This does not occur
because different NaC/HC exchanger isoforms are present in each domain that
respond differently to intracellular signals. For example, stimulated increases in
cytosolic Ca2C and activation of protein kinase C appear to inhibit luminal NaC/HC
</p>
<p>exchangers, whereas they may activate basolateral isoforms. Another example of
coordinated regulation of cellular transport processes is the stimulation of active Cl�
</p>
<p>secretion. Here, the opening of the Cl� channel is accompanied by activation of the
NaC/KC/2 Cl� co-transporter, the latter event required for bringing in additional
Cl� ions for sustained secretion. Again, this coordination of cellular processes
requires the actions of intracellular second messengers and protein kinases that
simultaneously activate co-dependent transport pathways.
</p>
<p>Finally, the regulation of intestinal transport processes may in part involve
modulation of paracellular permeability. For instance, the activation of protein
kinase C by various agonists or by the zonula occludens toxin (ZOT) of Vibrio
cholera may cause cytoskeletal alterations that affect the peri-junctional actin ring,
a major component of the tight-junction apparatus. Alterations in paracellular
permeability markedly affect both absorptive and secretory processes.
</p>
<p>5 Abnormality in Water and Electrolyte Transport
</p>
<p>Alterations in intestinal transport function in response to a variety of pathophys-
iological processes can be mediated by many different mechanisms. In some
instances, the responses are appropriate, i.e. as part of defensive or healing
mechanisms or in response to increased metabolic and nutritive demands caused by
disease. In other instances, however, the response is an aberration or manifestation
of the disease and serves no clear physiological role. This section will briefly
discuss a few illustrative examples of mechanisms by which disease processes affect
intestinal water and electrolyte transport.
</p>
<p>5.1 Adaptive Transport Mechanism in Diabetes
</p>
<p>Diabetes has significant and complex effects on nutrient and electrolyte transport
functions of the intestinal mucosa, some of which have now been well characterized.
An uncommon but debilitating complication of chronic diabetes is the development</p>
<p/>

<p>Fig. 5.16 Cell mechanisms of diabetic diarrhea. Autonomic and possibly enteric neuropathy in
diabetes leads to impaired homeostatic regulation of intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport,
abnormal motility, and alterations in capillary blood flow (right side), compared with normal
condition (left side) (Adapted from American Gastroenterological Association Teaching Slide
Collection 25 &copy;, Bethesda, Maryland; Used with permission)
</p>
<p>of diabetic diarrhea. This condition is invariability associated with autonomic
neuropathy and arises from an aberrant neural regulation of salt and water transport,
as well as abnormal motility. In streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats, for instance, a
selective impairment of adrenergic innervation of the mucosa results in an imbalance
in factors that regulate absorptive and secretory processes, favoring the latter
(Fig. 5.16). Thus, the development of autonomic and possibly enteric neuropathy in
diabetes causes impaired homeostatic regulation of intestinal fluid and electrolyte
transport, abnormal motility, and alterations in capillary flow.
</p>
<p>5.2 Transport of Inflamed Mucosa
</p>
<p>In mucosal inflammation, the interactions and effects of the factors and cellular
components that normally regulate ion transport functions are dramatically altered
or diminished as a result of the large number of infiltrating inflammatory cells. These
cells secrete large amounts of immune and inflammatory mediators and cause net
intestinal secretion; they can also adversely affect mucosal integrity and function</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>

</p>
<p>Fig. 5.17 Effects of inflammatory mediators on ion transport. These cells from several sources
cause direct and indirect stimulation of intestinal secretion (Adapted from American Gastroentero-
logical Association Teaching Slide Collection 25 &copy;, Bethesda, Maryland; Used with permission)
</p>
<p>(Fig. 5.17). While net secretion serves to purge the gut of noxious agents and
pathogens, it may also cause severe fluid losses and metabolic imbalances. Arachi-
donic acid metabolites from neutrophils, fibroblasts and activated macrophages
play a major role in stimulating net secretion. While many prostaglandins such
as PGE2 appear to activate specific epithelial cell receptors to stimulate anion
secretion and inhibit NaC and Cl� absorption, agents such as PGD2, PGI2,
and the peptido-leukotriene LTC4 activate secretomotor neurons. Similarly, other
inflammatory products such as radical oxygen metabolites, serotonin, histamine,
and platelet-activating factor that are made and secreted by activated phagocytic
and inflammatory cells have multiple sites of action. Many of these agents cause
immediate changes in motility and in blood capillary and lymphatic flow conducive
to net secretion.
</p>
<p>Some immune and inflammatory mediators appear to stimulate changes in
electrolyte transport via stimulation of intestinal arachidonate metabolism. For
example, interleukin-1 has been shown to stimulate anion secretion by activating
arachidonic acid metabolism of submucosal cells. The nonapeptide bradykinin is
liberated from the precursor kininogen by the enzyme kallikrein, found either in
plasma or tissue. Bradykinin is a potent secretagogue, stimulating large increases in
prostaglandin production from the intestine; however, it may also have a direct effect
on intestinal epithelial transport.Nitric oxide, a non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5 Intestinal Water and Electrolyte Transport 129
</p>
<p>(NANC) neurotransmitter and product of endothelial cells, also has many unique
actions that may play a role in inflammation-induced secretion. It is produced by
activated phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages and is probably
produced in large amounts in inflamed tissue. Nitric oxide activates the iron- and
sulfur-containing soluble form of guanylate cyclase, which, in intestinal mucosa,
is predominantly found in lamina propria cells. However, it is not clear whether
this effect mediates the secretory actions of nitric oxide. On the other hand, nitric
oxide does appear to stimulate arachidonate metabolism and enteric secretomotor
neurons, which mediate the secretory action of this agent. Purinergic agonists such
as adenosine and ATP are also major products of inflammatory cells and stimulate
net intestinal secretion. They may be important mediators stimulating secretion
after their release from neutrophils in crypt abscesses, as their secretory effects are
most pronounced on the luminal side. Adenosine may act through stimulation of
adenosine type 2 receptors, increasing cAMP but at low concentrations; its secretory
effects may be mediated by other mechanisms.
</p>
<p>A common denominator of the actions of many inflammatory mediators is their
ability to activate the secretomotor neurons of the enteric nervous system. Enteric
nerves may therefore be important in amplifying the actions of numerous immune
and inflammatory mediators, either by potentiating their actions at target tissues
through the release of neurotransmitters or by enlarging the domain of action and
affecting numerous target tissues simultaneously. Stimulated secretomotor neurons
would affect smooth muscle function and the flow and permeability of blood
capillaries and lymphatic in a manner that would help sustain or enhance the
secretory effects.
</p>
<p>5.3 Effects of Other Conditions and Disease
</p>
<p>Processes on Transport
</p>
<p>Infectious Pathogens
</p>
<p>Diarrhea, a common sequela of infections by enteric pathogens, arises from
numerous mechanisms (Fig. 5.18). Enterotoxigenic organisms cause net secretion
by stimulating intestinal anion secretion and inhibiting NaC and Cl� absorption.
Cholera toxin, for example, specifically binds to the GM1-ganglioside receptor
of the enterocyte luminal membrane and activates epithelial adenylate cyclase
followingADP-ribosylation of Gs the GTP-binding regulatory protein (Fig. 5.19). In
contrast, E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) binds to the putative guanylin receptor
and activates guanylate cyclase to increase cellular cGMP.
</p>
<p>Many cytotoxic bacterial toxins such as those from Salmonella and Shigella
and viral pathogens obviously cause mucosal destruction and loss of absorptive
surface area, leading to luminal accumulation of fluid and loss of plasma proteins.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Fig. 5.18 Cellular mechanisms of action by which enteric pathogens cause diarrhea (Adapted
from American Gastroenterological Association Teaching Slide Collection 25 &copy;, Bethesda,
Maryland; Used with permission)
</p>
<p>The induced inflammatory response plays a key role in stimulating net intestinal
secretion, propulsive motor contractions, and alterations in blood flow. Others, such
as toxin A of Clostridium difficile, cause net secretion by directly stimulating
epithelial anion secretion and by increasing paracellular permeability. Toxin A
also appears to have chemo-attractant properties and is capable of stimulating
immune and inflammatory cells by a Ca2C-mediated mechanism. Finally, several
non-invasive enteric pathogens, such as entero-adherent E. coli, Giardia lamblia,
and Cryptosporidium, may cause diarrhea by affecting luminal membrane function.
These organisms adhere to the brush-border membrane and can cause subtle
structural alterations, best appreciated at the ultrastructural level. Often there is
an effacement of microvilli and disruption of the microvillus and terminal-web
cytoskeleton. These abnormalities may cause or contribute to defective ion transport
and maintenance of tight-junction integrity. In Giardia infections, other mucosal
alterations may be present; they include a significant decrease in crypt depth,
decreased villus height in the duodenum, increased villus height in the ileum, and a
generalized shortening of microvillus height.
</p>
<p>Adaptation Following Extensive Small Bowel Resection
</p>
<p>Following extensive resection of the small bowel, several morphologic and func-
tional alterations of the intestinal mucosa occur and thus increase the absorptive
capacity of the remaining gut. There is a significant (about 30 %) increase in villus
size caused by mucosal hyperplasia. The net effect of these structural changes</p>

remaining mucosa. The mechanisms underlying these adaptive changes are not fully
elucidated, but they are believed to involve stimulation by luminal factors such

trophic factors.</p>

<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>While on vacation in Mexico, a medical student develops severe watery diarrhea
without blood, abdominal pain, and nausea. He becomes increasingly dehydrated
and weak. Immediately after returning to Hong Kong, he seeks medical attention.
Stool examination is negative for fecal leukocytes, fat, or blood, and sigmoidoscopy
reveals normal mucosa.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. How would you explain the pathogenesis of watery diarrhea in this patient?
Answer 1: This patient has an infectious diarrheal illness frequently experienced
by travelers visiting places where sanitation and water supply may be sub-
optimal. Because of the absence of blood and fecal leukocyte and the normal
appearance of gut mucosa, the most likely pathogen in this instance is an
enterotoxigenic E. coli that elaborates a heat-stable enterotoxin (STa). STa
mainly binds to luminal receptors for guanylin in the colon. This receptor is
a guanylate cyclase and converts GTP to cGMP. Increases in cellular cGMP
activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase, which phosphorylates a number of
target substrate proteins that mediate ion transport. Thus, STa stimulates net
secretion of water and electrolytes by stimulating active secretion and inhibition
of sodium absorption. Mucosal histology and endoscopic appearances are intact,
as this organism is not invasive and does not induce an inflammatory reaction.
</p>
<p>2. How would you treat his condition?
Answer 2: The treatment is symptomatic. Most patients have a self-limiting
diarrheal illness, and by the time they seek medical attention, they are usually
feeling better. If dehydration or metabolic abnormalities are severe, intravenous
replacement of fluid and electrolytes may be indicated. Otherwise, oral rehy-
dration is sufficiently enough (see oral rehydration therapy below). Antibiotics
are not usually required, as the diarrhea is purgative and the organisms are cleared
within a few days.
</p>
<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>While in rural Bangladesh, you witness an outbreak of cholera during flooding
which is caused by the rainy season. One of the major clinical manifestations
of the affected people they experience is profuse watery diarrhea that can cause
dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, thus death ensues. Because of the limited
health resources in your area, you must treat patients with whatever is available to
you.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What is the underlying mechanism of cholera that causes watery diarrhea?
Answer: Cholera is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world
which is caused by Vibrio cholerae, a bacterial organism that contaminates water</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>5 Intestinal Water and Electrolyte Transport 133
</p>
<p>and food supplies and it is acquired by fecal-oral transmission. V. cholerae
elaborates a heat-labile toxin called cholera toxin, which is one of the most
potent secretagogue substances known. The toxin causes a functional derange-
ment of sodium and water transport. After the toxin binds GM1-ganglioside
receptors of the luminal membrane of enterocytes, the alpha subunit is inserted
into the cell. The subunit catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of the alpha subunit
of stimulatory G protein (Gs), irreversibly activating it and adenylate cyclase
activity. Resultant increases in cAMP activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase
and phosphorylation of proteins involved in mediating active anion secretion or
neutral sodium chloride absorption. The effects of the toxin are only diminished
after the enterocyte population turns over (several days). During this time, no
mucosal lesions are seen, but patients experience profuse watery diarrhea of such
severity that many die of dehydration and metabolic disturbances.
</p>
<p>2. What is the most effective treatment option that you recommend for this
condition?
</p>
<p>Answer: Oral replacement with water and sodium is not effective because
cholera toxin inhibits absorption by the gut, probably by inhibiting luminal
NaC/HC exchangers. However, by taking advantage of other NaC-transport
pathways not affected by increases in cellular cAMP, oral replenishment of lost
fluid and electrolytes is possible. Thus, by adding sugar (e.g. glucose) to oral
salt replacement fluids, one can dramatically increase intestinal absorption of
salt and water. Since the function of the luminal carrier protein, called sodium-
dependent glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1), is intact and unaffected by
cholera toxin, hexoses such as glucose will promote the absorption of sodium
and water. With this type of oral formulation, millions of lives each year are
saved.
</p>
<p>In this instance, where glucose may not be readily available, one could
try the traditional remedy of rice water supplemented with salt, which
contains starch or complex carbohydrates. Starch is made up of glucose polymers
assembled by 1,4- and 1,6-glycosidic linkages. Starch is rapidly hydrolyzed by
pancreatic and intestinal membrane-bound enzymes or disaccharidases (which
are intact in cholera) to form glucose. Luminal glucose (as described above) is
co-transported with NaC.
</p>
<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A newborn infant develops abdominal distention and vomiting within 48 hours of
birth. Physical examination of the abdomen is consistent with intestinal obstruction.
Barium enema shows a microcolon and meconium, normally excreted after birth, in
the distal ileum, suggesting a diagnosis of meconium ileus.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What might this child have and how does it predispose to meconium ileus?
Answer: This child has cystic fibrosis (CF), which was later confirmed by an
abnormal sweat test. The defects in CF involve mutations of the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, resulting in the failure of CF-protein</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>134 E.B. Chang and P.S. Leung
</p>
<p>insertion into the cell membrane and activation by cAMP-dependent protein
kinase. In the intestinal mucosa, CFTR is a cAMP-regulated Cl� channel of the
luminal membrane that mediates active water and electrolyte secretion. Its defect
in CF results in inadequate luminal hydration of intestinal contents, especially in
utero. As a consequence, meconium (consisting of ingested contents of amniotic
fluid, secretions that collect in the intestinal lumen, and mucosal, pancreatic,
and other enteric proteins) become inspissated and extremely viscous. This can
eventually result in obstruction and failure of luminal contents to enter the
colon (hence a microcolon). This patient may require surgical intervention or
medical treatment aimed at reducing meconium viscosity (e.g. acetylcysteine)
or increasing its hydration and breakup (Gastrografin).
</p>
<p>2. Would a patient with CF be susceptible to cholera?
Answer: Probably not. In fact, it has been hypothesized that the development
of CF-genetic lesions arose from a selection process that favored resistance to
cholera toxin. Since these patients have defective regulation of C1� secretion
by cAMP, they are virtually immune to the actions of cholera toxin.

<p>Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates
</p>
<p>and Proteins
</p>
<p>Michael D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The pathways used for the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates and proteins
share several important common features. Proteins and starch, one of the major
dietary carbohydrates, are both polymers that are initially broken down into smaller
compounds by enzymes secreted into the intestinal lumen, principally by the pan-
creas. Further digestion occurs by a variety of enzymes present in the small intestinal
brush-border membrane, generating the small molecules (monosaccharides, amino
acids, di- and tripeptides) that are capable of being absorbed by the enterocytes.
Transport of these molecules through the intestine occurs mainly via various
membrane carrier proteins. In some cases, there is an active transport mechanism
by which the movement of the nutrient through the membrane is coupled directly
or indirectly to a source of metabolic energy, permitting concentrative transport
against an electrochemical gradient. Other carrier systems accelerate the rate of
movement of a nutrient through the membrane, but they are not linked to an
energy source and therefore do not result in concentration against an electrochemical
gradient. This type of transport process is known as facilitated diffusion. Simple
passive diffusion either through the plasma membrane or between the enterocytes
(the paracellular pathway) is quantitatively important only when the luminal
concentration of nutrients is very high.

<p>2 Carbohydrates
</p>
<p>Dietary carbohydrates consist of complex carbohydrates, starch or dietary fiber,
and various sugars, including monosaccharides (glucose, galactose, fructose) and
disaccharides (sucrose, lactose, maltose). Adult males consume approximately
300 g/day of carbohydrates, and adult females, approximately 200 g/day, half as
starch and half as various sugars. Carbohydrates provide about 45&ndash;50 % of the
energy contained in the average American diet.
</p>
<p>2.1 Structure of Dietary Starch
</p>
<p>Two principal types of dietary starch are present in the human diet. Amylose
is composed almost entirely of &rsquo;-1,4-linked linear chains of glucose, with an
average chain length of about 600 glucose residues and a molecular weight of about
100 kd.Amylopectin is a branched starch with a molecular weight of approximately
1,000 kd and contains about 6,000 glucose residues. Amylopectin has both &rsquo;-1,4-
linked straight chains and &rsquo;-1,6-linked branch points occurring approximately
every 20 glucose residues (Fig. 6.1). The ratio of amylose to amylopectin varies in
different foods, but it is usually about 1:4.
</p>
<p>In food, starches are present in association with proteins, many of which are
hydrophobic. The starch tends to be in the interior of the complex particle, limiting
access to enzymes responsible for starch hydrolysis. Starch digestion is facilitated
by physical processing, such as cracking grains and milling, and by cooking, which
converts the starch from a crystalline to a gel structure. Certain foods contain protein
inhibitors of starch digestion.
</p>

amylose and amylopectin, the two major forms of starch (Adapted from Alpers [1])</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6 Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates and Proteins 139
</p>
<p>2.2 Starch Digestion by ˛-Amylases
</p>
<p>The enzymes responsible for intraluminal starch digestion, &rsquo;-amylases, are present
in both salivary and pancreatic secretions. Human salivary amylase is 94 %
identical with pancreatic amylase, although the two enzyme forms are the products
of different genes. Salivary amylase tends to be degraded at acidic pH (less
than pH 3-3.5), but the rate of degradation decreases when salivary amylase is
accompanied by its starch substrate or by its oligosaccharide breakdown products.
The substrate interacts with the active hydrolytic site and maintains the amylase in a
more favorable conformation that allows some active enzyme to survive passage
into the duodenum. Thus, while pancreatic amylase is responsible for most of
the intraluminal starch hydrolysis in adults, some active salivary amylase is usually
present in jejunal fluid. In neonates with immature pancreatic function and limited
secretion of pancreatic amylase, salivary amylase supports a significant fraction of
starch digestion.
</p>
<p>The five glucose residues adjacent to the terminal-reducing glucose unit of
amylose and amylopectin bind to specific catalytic subsites of &rsquo;-amylase. There
is then cleavage between the second and third &rsquo;-1,4-linked glucose residues. The
disaccharide maltose and the trisaccharide maltotriose are therefore the main
products of amylose digestion (Fig. 6.1). &rsquo;-amylase has no activity against the
&rsquo;-1,6-linkages in amylopectin and the capacity to break &rsquo;-1,4 links adjacent
to branch points is sterically hindered. In addition to maltose and maltotriose,
therefore, about one third of the degradation products of amylopectin are &rsquo;-limit
dextrins and branched oligosaccharides with one or more &rsquo;-1,6 bonds and an
average molecular weight of 800&ndash;1,000 kd (5&ndash;10 glucose units) (Fig. 6.1).
</p>
<p>2.3 Brush-Border Membrane Digestion of Oligosaccharides
</p>
<p>The oligosaccharide products of &rsquo;-amylase starch digestion are hydrolyzed by
enzymes on the brush-border membrane surface, and only free glucose is trans-
ported into the enterocyte. These oligosaccharidases are large glycoproteins, with
most of the protein, including the catalytic domain, residing at the lumen-cell
interface. The enzymes are anchored into the membrane by a short hydrophobic
segment. The activities of the oligosaccharidases are greatest in the proximal small
intestine and decline distally; starch digestion is normally complete in the jejunum.
Membrane hydrolysis of starch-derived oligosaccharides is normally very rapid and
is not rate-limiting in the overall process of starch digestion and absorption.
</p>
<p>Three enzymes are responsible for the brush-border membrane hydrolysis of
oligosaccharides to glucose. (1) Glucoamylase (maltase) removes single glucose
residues sequentially from the nonreducing end of the &rsquo;-1,4 chain, preferring
substrates of 5&ndash;9 saccharide units; however, like &rsquo;-amylase, it is blocked when an
&rsquo;-1,6-linked glucose is at the terminal end of the saccharide. Sucrase-isomaltase
is initially synthesized in the enterocyte as a single glycoprotein chain and, after</p>

</p>
<p>insertion in the brush-border membrane, is cleaved by pancreatic proteases into
sucrase and isomaltase units, which then reassociate noncovalently at the intestinal
surface (see below). (2) Sucrase is highly-efficient at hydrolyzing short &rsquo;-1,4-linked
oligosaccharides, such as maltose and maltotriose. (3) Isomaltase is the only
enzyme that can cleave the nonreducing, terminal &rsquo;-1,6 bond once it becomes
uncovered. As shown in Fig. 6.2, the digestion of a typical &rsquo;-limit dextrin involves
the initial removal of glucose residues from the nonreducing end mainly by
glucoamylase, the cleavage of the &rsquo;-1,6 branching link by isomaltase, and finally the
digestion of maltotriose and maltose to glucose principally by sucrase. In general,
glucoamylase activity determines the rate of starch digestion.
</p>
<p>The oligosaccharidases are synthesized as large glycosylated precursors that
are then processed to the mature enzyme form. For example, sucrase-isomaltase
is first synthesized as a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of
240&ndash;260 kd. O-linked and N-linked sugar chains are added and the precursor is
transferred to the brush-border membrane by a vesicular pathway moving along
microtubules and inserted into the membrane through its amino terminus. Pancreatic
enzymes, mainly trypsin, cleave the protein into two subunits, the isomaltase
subunit that is membrane-anchored near its amino-terminus and sucrase that is
noncovalently bound to isomaltase. Various mutations in the sucrase-isomaltase
gene affecting the processing of the precursor protein, the intracellular transport
to the apical membrane, and the active catalytic site have been reported. In contrast
to sucrase-isomaltase, human glucoamylase is synthesized as a single polypeptide
chain that is N- and O-glycosylated and inserted into the brush-border membrane
without intracellular or extracellular proteolytic processing.
</p>
<p>Brush-border membrane oligosaccharidase activities are affected by many fac-
tors and their regulation is complex, involving alterations in transcriptional and
post-transcriptional events. In humans, sucrase and glucoamylase mRNA and pro-
tein appear in the fetal intestine at 10&ndash;14 weeks&rsquo; gestation and are fully developed at
birth. The regulation of enzyme activities along the crypt-villus axis also appears to
generally reflect the mRNA abundances. For example, sucrase-isomaltase mRNA is</p>

<p>absent in crypt cells, but detectable at the crypt-villus junction, and enzyme activ-
ity is greatest in themid-upper villus. Dietary modifications produce alterations in
oligosaccharidase activities that may be caused by changes in enzyme synthesis,
enzyme degradation, or the activity of the catalytic site. For example, sucrose
feeding increases sucrase mRNA content, whereas feeding a carbohydrate-free diet
has been shown to cause conversion of brush-border membrane sucrase to an
inactive molecular species. Pancreatic enzymes participate in the degradation of
oligosaccharidases and may account, at least in part, for the observed diurnal
variation in enzyme activities. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), an important
peptide regulator of intestinal function, affects the intracellular processing and
degradation of sucrase.

<p>2.4 Intestinal Glucose Transporters
</p>
<p>The efficient intestinal absorption of glucose occurs through the coordinated action
of transport proteins located in the brush-border and basolateral membranes
(Fig. 6.3). One pathway of glucose uptake into the enterocyte occurs by a NaC-
dependent active transport mechanism. Two sodium ions enter the enterocyte
for each molecule of glucose transported, and this absorptive process is therefore
electrogenic (net charge transfer across the membrane). NaC increases the affinity of
the transporter for glucose, and the energy for glucose accumulation is derived from
the transmembrane electrochemical NaC gradient. The NaC gradient is maintained
by the action of NaC,KC-ATPase (sodium pump) located on the basolateral</p>

</p>
<p>membrane surface, and glucose uptake is therefore a secondary active transport
system in which the ATPase indirectly provides the energy for uptake.
</p>
<p>The transport protein responsible for NaC-dependent glucose transport
(SGLT1) has been cloned and characterized (Fig. 6.4). The human protein
contains 664 amino acids and has a molecular weight of about 73 kd. It has
14 membrane spanning domains with both extracellular amino- and carboxyl-
termini. SGLT1 contains an N-linked glycosylation site in a hydrophilic,
extracellular domain, but glycosylation does not appear to alter the properties of the
carrier protein significantly. SGLT1 has several phosphorylation sites that appear
to play regulatory roles. Activation of protein kinase A or protein kinase C alters
the glucose transport rate. SGLT1 is a high affinity, but rather low capacity glucose
transporter. In addition to glucose, galactose and other sugars, but not fructose,
are transported by SGLT1. SGLT1 expression is high in neonatal intestine, and
increases as enterocytes migrate from the crypt to the villus tip (Fig. 6.5). SGLT1
mRNA is increased by feeding a high sugar diet and in diabetes mellitus.
</p>
<p>Glucose-galactose malabsorption is a rare genetic defect in monosaccharide
absorption that is manifested as severe watery diarrhea in newborn children when
milk or sugar water is ingested. A variety of mutations ranging from missense
mutations to mutations that impair trafficking of SGLT1 to the brush-border
membrane causes glucose-galactose malabsorption.
</p>
<p>Oral rehydration therapy is used to treat the dehydration associated with
cholera and other diarrheal diseases, and this simple approach has markedly reduced
mortality due to childhood diarrhea. Patients are given solutions containing glucose,</p>

et al. [19])
</p>
<p>sodium, chloride, and potassium. Oral administration of glucose upregulates
SGLT1 and absorption of glucose and NaC results in increased water absorption
by a mechanism that is still uncertain.
</p>
<p>Glucose and other sugars are transported out of the enterocyte into the portal cir-
culation by a NaCindependent facilitative diffusion mechanism. Kinetic studies
using basolateral membrane vesicles have shown that this process has a relatively
low affinity and high capacity for glucose transport. This membrane transporter,
Glut-2, is a 524-amino-acid protein that has no homology to SGLT1 (Fig. 6.4).
Glut-2 has 12 membrane-spanning regions with intracellular amino and carboxyl
terminals and sites for glycosylation and phosphorylation. In addition to glucose,
Glut-2 can also transport galactose, fructose, and mannose. Glut-2 expression
increases as cells migrate from the intestinal crypt to the villous tip, and increases
with sugar feeding (Fig. 6.5). Evidence exists for a second pathway for glucose exit
from the enterocyte involving glucose phosphorylation, transport to the endoplasmic
reticulum, dephosphorylation, and exit via microsomal transport and trafficking.
</p>
<p>Glut-2 can also be detected in the enterocyte brush-border membrane. Current
evidence suggests that transport of glucose into the enterocyte via SGLT1 pro-
motes the rapid insertion of Glut-2 into the brush-border membrane via a signal
transduction pathway involving protein kinase C &ldquo;II (PKC&ldquo;II). The hypothesis
is that brush-border membrane Glut-2 is low when the luminal glucose level
is low. When luminal glucose increases there is transport of glucose into the
enterocyte by SGLT1 which induces recruitment of Glut-2 to the brush-border
membrane, providing a high capacity system for glucose uptake. This model
explains the severe sugar malabsorption observed with mutation of SGLT1,
as recruitment of Glut-2 to the brush-border membrane would be impaired in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>144 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>this condition. Apical Glut-2 insertion is regulated by many factors, including
sugars, long-term dietary carbohydrate intake, glucocorticoids, the gastrointestinal
hormone GLP-2, cellular metabolic needs, and certain medications used for treating
diabetes.
</p>
<p>2.5 Digestion and Absorption of Dietary Sugars
</p>
<p>Dietary sugars represent approximately half of the digestible carbohydrate in the
human diet. Important dietary sugars include the monosaccharides glucose and
fructose and the disaccharides lactose, sucrose, and maltose. The disaccharides
must be digested by brush-border membrane disaccharidases to their component
monosaccharides that are then transported through the enterocytes.
</p>
<p>The milk sugar lactose (glucose-&ldquo;-1,4-galactose) is the major carbohydrate
consumed in the neonatal period. Human milk contains 7 % lactose, more than
most other mammalian species. The brush-border membrane disaccharidase lactase
is responsible for the digestion of lactose to glucose and galactose, which is then
absorbed using the brush-border and basolateral-membrane glucose transporters,
SGLT1 and Glut-2. In contrast to other disaccharides, hydrolysis by lactase is the
rate-limiting step in the overall process of intestinal lactose absorption. Lactase
also is responsible for the hydrolysis of glycolipids present in the intestinal lumen,
utilizing a different catalytic site on the protein than that responsible for lactose
hydrolysis.
</p>
<p>Expression of lactase begins in late gestation, and high levels of the enzyme
are expressed in the neonatal period, particularly in the proximal and mid-jejunum.
In most mammalian species, lactase activity markedly declines after weaning. In
humans, however, two general patterns of lactase expression are observed post-
weaning. In most humans, a pattern similar to other mammals is observed, with
lactase activity declining after weaning, and by age 5-10 years enzyme specific
activity drops to the adult level, approximately 10 % of the neonatal value.
Individuals with nonpersistence of lactase (adult-type hypolactasia) frequently
develop abdominal pain, cramping, distention, flatulence, diarrhea, nausea, and
occasionally vomiting after consuming significant amounts of lactose-containing
dairy products. These symptoms are caused by malabsorbed lactose drawing
water into the intestinal lumen, producing an osmotic diarrhea, and by the gut
bacterial flora metabolizing the unabsorbed lactose, forming gases such as hydrogen,
methane, and carbon dioxide (Fig. 6.6). A minority of humans, however, demon-
strate persistence of a high level of lactase activity in the adult small intestine. This
is a genetically determined trait with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance of
lactase persistence. It has been suggested that lactase persistence offers a selective
advantage to individuals living in population groups that practice dairy farming.
The prevalence of lactose malabsorption therefore varies widely in different ethnic
or racial groups (Table 6.1).</p>

<p>(From Buller and Grand [4])
</p>
<p>The molecular regulation of lactase expression has been intensely investigated,
particularly with respect to the factors that determine the postweaning decline
in lactase levels or lactase persistence. The proenzyme is synthesized as a sin-
gle polypeptide containing 1,927 amino acids, including a 19-amino-acid signal
peptide. Prolactase undergoes a series of N- and O-glycosylations that affect
intracellular transport and enzymatic activity. Prolactase is converted by intracel-
lular proteolysis and extracellular cleavage by pancreatic proteases to the mature
enzyme form (approximately 160 kd, 1,060 amino acids) present in the brush-
border membrane. The C-terminus is intracellular and the N-terminus is found</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>146 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>on the luminal side of the brush-border membrane. Lactase is anchored into the
brush-border membrane by a hydrophobic amino acid sequence located near the
carboxyl-terminus.
</p>
<p>In adults with persistence of lactase activity, lactase mRNA and protein are
present in essentially all of the intestinal villus cells in the proximal jejunum.
The mRNA is most abundant in the cells at the crypt-villus junction, whereas the
protein is highest in the midvillus region. Lactase mRNA is highest in the distal
jejunum and proximal ileum.
</p>
<p>Gene polymorphisms have been described in the five-prime region flanking the
lactase gene that are associated with adult-type hypolactasia or lactase persistence.
In the Finnish population, individuals homozygous for a C at position -13910
upstream of the lactase gene have hypolactasia, whereas those homozygous for a
T at that position have lactase persistence. Heterozygotes have an intermediate level
of lactase that is sufficient for lactose digestion. A G at position -22018 is more
than 95 % associated with hypolactasia, whereas an A at that position correlates
with lactase persistence. Chromosomes with a T at position -13910 all have an
A at -22018. The C -13910 allele has been reported to result in reduced transcription
of the lactase gene, but this is controversial. The T-13910 and A-22018 alleles,
however, are not found in some African and Bedouin populations with lactase
persistence; other mutations in the five prime region have been identified. A small
number of individuals with non-persistence of lactose have been showed to have an
abnormality in the intracellular processing of newly synthesized lactase.
</p>
<p>Lactase is expressed at high levels in the human neonatal intestine. Congenital
lactase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a marked
reduction in intestinal lactase activity resulting in watery diarrhea, dehydration,
acidosis, and weight loss when the neonate is fed breast milk or lactose-containing
formula. Mutations in the lactase gene causing premature truncation of lactase
and missense mutations have been described in children with congenital lactase
deficiency.
</p>
<p>In humans, lactose ingestion has little effect on intestinal lactase activity.
Hormones, particularly thyroid hormone and glucocorticoids, appear to play
modulatory roles in the developmental regulation of lactase expression.
</p>
<p>Fructose is present in the diet in several forms, as part of the disaccharide sucrose
(see below), as a monosaccharide in foods such as honey and certain fruits, and as
fructose sweeteners formed by the enzymatic conversion of glucose in cornstarch to
fructose. Fructose is taken up into the enterocyte by aNaC-independent, facilitated
diffusion mechanism. Glut-5 has been identified as the intestinal brush-border
membrane fructose transporter (Fig. 6.3). This transporter is a 501-amino-acid
protein that has 41 % amino acid identity and a similar structure to Glut-2. Glut-5
knockout mice have severely impaired fructose absorption. Glut-2 in the brush-
border membrane may also be responsible for some fructose uptake, particular at
high fructose loads. Glut-5 is expressed at low levels at birth and increases post-
weaning, perhaps modulated in part by glucocorticoids. Glut-5 mRNA expression
is increased by fructose feeding. Glut-5 expression increases as enterocytes migrate
from the crypt to the villus (Fig. 6.5). Fructose is transported from the enterocyte
into the portal circulation via the basolateral-membrane Glut-2 transporter.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6 Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates and Proteins 147
</p>
<p>Fructose is not as well absorbed as is glucose, and there is considerable
interindividual variation in the efficiency of fructose absorption. Patients with
chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, gas, and bloating, due to a
very limited capacity for fructose absorption have been identified.
</p>
<p>Sucrose (table sugar) is the disaccharide glucose-&rsquo;-1,2-fructose. The brush-
border membrane disaccharidase sucrase hydrolyzes sucrose into the monosac-
charides glucose and fructose, which are then absorbed as previously described.
Intestinal fructose absorption is considerably more efficient when the fructose is
administered as sucrose rather than as an equivalent amount of the monosaccha-
ride. Furthermore, co-administration of glucose with fructose enhances fructose
absorption. These findings may be explained by recruitment of Glut-2 to the apical
membrane during glucose absorption.
</p>
<p>2.6 Dietary Fiber
</p>
<p>The term dietary fiber operationally refers to plant material that resists digestion by
the enzymes of the human GI tract. With the exception of lignin, the components
of dietary fiber are carbohydrates that are mainly constituents of plant cell walls,
such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectins, among others. These polysaccharides,
with the exception of wood cellulose, are partially metabolized by enzymes present
in gut bacteria, producing short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, and butyrate),
hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. The short-chain fatty acids are absorbed to
some extent by the distal small intestine and colon and can be utilized as a metabolic
fuel. Butyrate, in particular, appears to be the principal energy source for the large
intestine. Starches that resist efficient hydrolysis by &rsquo;-amylases and some poorly
absorbed dietary sugars and sugar alcohols will also be converted to short-chain
fatty acids by gut bacteria, permitting salvage of some of the energy contained in
those compounds.
</p>
<p>The components of dietary fiber have many diverse effects on gastrointestinal
function. For example, fiber can alter intestinal absorption of various nutrients
by several mechanisms, including changing the physical characteristics of the
luminal contents via the hydratability of fiber and by binding cations and organic
compounds. Certain types of fiber, such as wheat bran, decrease gastrointestinal
transit time, whereas other fiber components, such as pectin and guar gum, increase
gastrointestinal transit time. Short-chain fatty acids produced from dietary fiber
stimulate colonic salt and water absorption and regulate colonocyte proliferation and
differentiation.Dietary fiber alters the gastrointestinal flora, influencing the diversity
and numbers of microorganisms.
</p>
<p>Epidemiologic studies have repeatedly demonstrated an association between low
fiber diets and common diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes,
colorectal and other cancers, and obesity. The specific components of dietary fiber
and the mechanisms of action resulting in these putative health effects remain
controversial.</p>

<p>3 Protein
</p>
<p>The normal adult human requires approximately 0.75 g/kg body weight per day of
highly digestible, high-quality protein to ensure maintenance of nitrogen balance
and an adequate supply of essential amino acids. Higher protein intakes are needed
to support normal growth, pregnancy, and lactation. Nine of the 20 amino
acids commonly found in food, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine,
phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine are not synthesized by mammals.
They are therefore termed essential amino acids, because they must be obtained
from dietary sources. Other amino acids may become conditionally essential in
disease because of impaired conversion from precursors, and protein requirements
are generally increased with illnesses such as sepsis and trauma.
</p>
<p>Individual dietary proteins differ in their amino acid compositions, but all food
proteins, except gelatin, contain some of each amino acid. The digestibility of
different proteins varies considerably, with plant proteins generally digested more
poorly than animal proteins. Protein digestibility is influenced by methods of food
processing. In addition to proteins contained in the diet, approximately 35 g/day of
protein is secreted into the intestine in various digestive juices, and 30 g/day enter
the lumen as part of desquamated intestinal cells. These endogenous proteins are
digested and absorbed along with the dietary proteins. Overall, protein absorption
is quite efficient, with the normal adult excreting fecal nitrogen equivalent to only
6&ndash;12 g/day of protein. The digestion of protein begins with intraluminal hydrolysis
by proteases secreted by the stomach and pancreas and continues as peptidases in
the brush-border membrane of the small intestine digest the protein to amino acids
and di- and tripeptides that are taken up by the enterocytes (Fig. 6.7).
</p>
<p>3.1 Acid-Peptic Digestion
</p>
<p>Gastric juice contains a family of proteolytic enzymes known as pepsins. In the
acid environment of the stomach, these enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing a broad
range of peptide bonds. Proteolysis within the stomach not only contributes to
overall protein digestion, but the peptides and amino acids that are generated are
important stimulators of gastrin and cholecystokinin release and are regulators of
gastric acid secretion and gastric emptying. In the neonatal stomach, chymosin,
which very effectively digests milk protein, is the predominant enzyme. In adults,
two families of enzymes, pepsin A and pepsin C, predominate. Pepsin A activity
comprises five closely related isoenzymes coded for by genes on chromosome 11,
whereas pepsin C represents two isoenzymes coded for on chromosome 6. These
enzymes are irreversibly denatured in a mildly alkaline fluid, and therefore little
peptic digestion occurs past the duodenum. Acid-peptic hydrolysis is not essential
for efficient protein digestion, as patients who have undergone total gastrectomy
have little impairment of protein utilization. In patients with pancreatic disease
and limited secretion of pancreatic proteases, however, acid-peptic proteolysis is
an important facilitator of protein digestion.</p>

</p>
<p>Pepsins are synthesized in the gastric chief cells as inactive pre-proenzymes.
A signal sequence of about 15 amino acids directs the protein to the interior of the
endoplasmic reticulum, where the signal sequence is cleaved. The resulting proen-
zyme (pepsinogen) is transferred to the Golgi apparatus and condensed into secre-
tory granules; in some cases it is also glycosylated. Secretion of the granules occurs
by exocytosis, stimulated by agents that increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) (secretin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, epinephrine, prostaglandins) or
that increase intracellular calcium concentration (acetylcholine, cholecystokinin,
gastrin). Secretion of pepsinogen is initially very rapid, but then declines to a
slower rate even before the chief cells are depleted of granules, suggesting feedback
regulation or receptor desensitization. Synthesis of new preproenzyme occurs
following stimulation of secretion. In the acid environment of the stomach, there
is cleavage of an N-terminal peptide of 44 amino acids from pepsinogen, forming
the active pepsin with a molecular weight of approximately 35 kd. The acid milieu
appears to cause a conformational change in pepsinogen that permits intramolecular
cleavage of the N-terminal activation peptide.
</p>
<p>3.2 Pancreatic Proteases
</p>
<p>Proteases are secreted by the pancreas as proenzymes (Chap. 4 for a detailed dis-
cussion of the regulation of pancreatic secretion). Activation of pancreatic proteases
is initiated by the intestinal brush-border enzyme enteropeptidase (enterokinase),</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8771-0_4">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8771-0_4</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>150 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>which is stimulated by trypsinogen contained in pancreatic juice and released from
the brush-border membrane by bile salts. Enteropeptidase has a single substrate,
trypsinogen, and cleaves an N-terminal hexapeptide forming trypsin, which can then
activate more trypsinogen and other pancreatic proenzymes.
</p>
<p>Pancreatic secretions contain a variety of endopeptidases (trypsin, chy-
motrypsin, elastase) and exopeptidases (carboxypeptidase A and B). Trypsin
cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of basic amino acids (lysine,
arginine), chymotrypsin on the carboxyl side of aromatic amino acids (tyrosine,
phenylalanine, tryptophan), and elastase on the carboxyl side of aliphatic amino
acids (alanine, leucine, glycine, valine, isoleucine). The carboxypeptidases are
zinc-containing metalloenzymes that remove single amino acids from the carboxyl-
terminal ends of proteins and peptides. This array of enzymes with different
substrate specificities results in the efficient hydrolysis of the different peptide
linkages present in food and in endogenous proteins. The result of intraluminal
hydrolysis is the production of 40 % free amino acids and 60 % oligopeptides in
the small intestinal juice. Proline-containing peptides are resistant to hydrolysis by
pancreatic enzymes.
</p>
<p>3.3 Brush-Border Membrane Peptidases
</p>
<p>Peptidases within the enterocyte brush-border membrane hydrolyze the oligopep-
tides generated by intraluminal digestion to free amino acids and the di- and
tripeptides transported into the enterocyte (Fig. 6.7). About 20 different peptidases
have been identified in the brush-border membrane, in contrast to the relatively
few enzymes involved in brush-border carbohydrate digestion. These peptidases
recognize specific amino acids at the amino- or carboxyl-terminus or internally
within the oligopeptide and are necessary for the hydrolysis of the wide variety
of peptide linkages found in food proteins. Many of these peptidases are dimeric
metalloenzymes that are anchored into the brush-border membrane by either a
hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain of the protein or through covalent attach-
ment to membrane glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol. The active site of the enzyme is
generally contained within a large hydrophilic portion of the protein that projects
into the intestinal lumen. The brush-border membrane peptidases are generally
classified into four groups: endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases,
and dipeptidases. The most abundant peptidase is probably aminopeptidase N,
which sequentially removes N-terminal amino acids from oligopeptides. The brush-
border membrane contains at least four peptidases that are active against peptides
with proline at the cleavage site. These enzymes are therefore complementary to the
pancreatic proteases that have little ability to hydrolyze peptide bonds containing
proline.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6 Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates and Proteins 151
</p>
<p>The enterocyte also contains at least four intracellular peptidases that are
involved in the digestion of absorbed di- and tripeptides (Fig. 6.7). Ninety percent
or more of the products of protein digestion appear in the portal blood as free
amino acids.
</p>
<p>In addition to participating in overall dietary protein digestion, several of the
intestinal peptidases have other specific functions. Folate conjugase is a brush-
border membrane carboxypeptidase that specifically degrades the polyglutamate
side chain of dietary folates, producing the monoglutamate form that is transported
into the enterocytes (Chap. 9). Other intestinal peptidases have been shown to be
involved in the activation or catabolism of gastrointestinal peptide hormones or
in the turnover of endogenous intestinal proteins. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV
(DPP IV) plays an important role in the metabolism of the incretin GLP1 that
enhances insulin secretion, and DPP IV inhibitors are used in the treatment of type
2 diabetes.
</p>
<p>The mechanisms for biosynthesis and intracellular sorting of brush-border
membrane peptidases are complex and differ significantly for the various enzymes.
Complex glycosylation events, changes in protein folding, metabolism of proen-
zyme forms, and dimerization are important steps in the synthesis and incorporation
into the brush-border membrane of peptidases. Most peptidases apparently have
direct transport routes to the brush-border membrane, but aminopeptidase N has
been shown to first appear in the basolateral membrane, followed by transit through
the Golgi apparatus before insertion in the brushborder membrane.
</p>
<p>The activities of brush-border membrane peptidases are highly regulated during
development and cellular differentiation and by starvation or feeding, with specific
patterns of enzyme expression observed for each peptidase. Aminopeptidase N is
abundant in the proximal jejunum, whereas dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is higher
in the ileum.
</p>
<p>3.4 Brush-Border Membrane Amino Acid Transport
</p>
<p>The intestinal brush-border membrane contains multiple transport systems for the
uptake of amino acids. Systems capable of transporting classes of amino acids were
defined based upon the physical-chemical properties, stereospecificity, size, and
charge of the amino acids transported, as well as the ion and pH dependencies.
Transport systems that have been identified include:
</p>
<p>1. &ldquo;Neutral system&rdquo; or &ldquo;methionine preferring system&rdquo; that transports all neutral
amino acids;
</p>
<p>2. &ldquo;Basic system&rdquo; that transports cationic amino acids and cysteine;
3. &ldquo;Acidic system&rdquo; that transports glutamate and aspartate;
4. &ldquo;Iminoglycine system&rdquo; that transports proline, hyroxyproline, and glycine; and
5. &ldquo;&ldquo;-amino acid system&rdquo; that transports taurine.</p>
<p/>
<div class="annotation"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8771-0_9">http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8771-0_9</a></div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>152 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>It should be recognized that there is significant overlap of substrate specifies
among the different transport systems. The various carrier systems may require
NaC, HC, Cl�, or KC as co-factors for amino acid transport, and may be electro-
genic or neutral. Some of the transport proteins corresponding to these systems have
been identified, and inherited defects in these transporters correspond to genetic
abnormalities in amino acid metabolism. The association of some of the amino acid
transporters to the apical membrane requires partner proteins, including members
of the renin-angiotensin system, collectrin (Tmem27) and angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2. Amino acid transport proteins also can transport orally administered
amino-acid based drugs and derivatives.
</p>
<p>3.5 Brush-Border Membrane Peptide Transport
</p>
<p>Extensive evidence now exists that small peptides are transported across the brush-
border membrane by a mechanism that is independent of the systems used for amino
acid uptake (Fig. 6.7). A patient with a genetic defect in amino acid transport, such
as Hartnup disease or cystinuria, may absorb certain free amino acids poorly, but
absorption of those amino acids as part of small peptides is normal. There is a lack of
competition between amino acid and peptide transport, often a faster absorption rate
for amino acids presented in peptides rather than in the free forms, and differences
in the developmental and dietary regulation of amino acid versus peptide uptake.
The absorptive capacity for small peptides is greater in the jejunum than the ileum,
whereas for amino acids it is greater in the ileum than the jejunum. Mainly di- and
tripeptides are absorbed by the enterocyte, with very limited uptake of tetrapeptides
and essentially no absorption of larger peptides.
</p>
<p>PEPT1 is the major, if not only, di-tripeptide carrier expressed in the small
intestinal brush-border membrane. The gene for PEPT1 is on chromosome 13, and
the open reading frame encodes 708 amino acids. There are 12 transmembrane
spanning domains with both the amino- and carboxy termini facing the cytoplasmic
side. PEPT1 is an electrogenic symport system in which the inwardly directed
proton gradient allows peptides to enter the cell against a concentration gradient. In
some experimental situations, a partial NaC dependency of peptide transportwas
identified. This is apparently an indirect effect, as brush-border NaC/HC exchange
via the NaC-proton antiporter NHE-3 is needed to maintain the inwardly directed
proton gradient. A remarkable feature of PEPT1 is the ability of this one molecule to
transport a myriad of possible di- and tripeptides generated from protein digestion.
Evidence suggests that water in the vicinity of the carrier&rsquo;s binding domain plays
a central role in shielding the electric charges of amino acid side chains, allowing
charged, polar, and large apolar molecules to bind. In addition to peptide digestion
products, PEPT1 can transport certain drugs, such as some ˇ-lactam antibiotics and
ACE inhibitors.</p>

<p>6 Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates and Proteins 153
</p>
<p>PEPT1 is acutely regulated by intracellular signaling pathways involving pro-
tein kinase A, protein kinase C, and intracellular calcium concentration. PEPT1
abundance and activity is also regulated by hormones such as insulin, growth
hormone, thyroid hormone, and leptin, and is altered in diabetes. Dietary protein,
certain amino acids, and peptides also alter PEPT1 expression. Normally PEPT1
is expressed throughout the small intestine, but is present at very low levels in
the colon. In patients who have undergone major resections of the small intestine
and have the short bowel syndrome and malabsorption, PEPT1 mRNA and protein
is expressed in the colonic mucosa, and may permit colonic peptide absorption.
Multiple mutations affecting various aspects of PEPT1 carrier function have been
described.
</p>
<p>3.6 Basolateral-Membrane Transporters
</p>
<p>Amino acids transported across the brush-border membrane and generated intracel-
lularly from proteolysis of absorbed peptides are transferred into the portal blood via
multiple carrier systems with different electrolyte and pH requirements. As much as
10 % of absorbed protein may be delivered into the portal blood as small peptides
(Fig. 6.7). A transport system similar, but not identical to PEPT1 has been found in
the basolateral membrane. There is not likely to be a substantial HC gradient from
the cytoplasm to the portal blood to drive transport, and it is possible that the high
postprandial concentration of di- and tripeptides within the enterocyte cytoplasm
compared with the minimal concentration of these peptides in blood is sufficient to
cause efficient transfer into the circulation.
</p>
<p>Transporters in the basolateral membrane can also mediate uptake of amino acids
from the circulation into enterocytes during fasting that supports enterocyte protein
synthesis.
</p>
<p>3.7 Regulation of Amino Acid and Peptide Absorption
</p>
<p>The absorption of amino acids and peptides is developmentally regulated and influ-
enced by diet, hormones, and growth factors. The transport systems are generally
present at birth, and transport rates for peptides and most amino acids decline
with age, although the magnitude of change differs among individual carriers.
High dietary levels of protein or amino acids generally result in upregulation of
peptide andmost amino acid transport. Short-term fasting also tends to increase the
absorption rates, but long-term starvation causes decreased amino acid transport
with little change in peptide absorption.</p>

<p>3.8 Role of Absorbed Amino Acids in Enterocyte
</p>
<p>Energy and Protein Metabolism
</p>
<p>Absorbed amino acids, particularly glutamine, glutamate, and aspartate, are the
major fuels for the small intestine. About 10 % of the absorbed amino acids is used
for protein synthesis within the enterocyte. In fact, there is preferential utilization of
absorbed amino acids versus those entering the enterocyte from the blood for energy
metabolism and protein synthesis.
</p>
<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>A 1-month-old infant is admitted with dehydration and a history of severe diarrhea
since birth. Her pediatrician places her on lactose-free and sucrose-free infant
formulas with no significant improvement in her condition. Stool examination
demonstrates the presence of a large quantity of reducing substances, which are
confirmed to be mainly glucose; the stool pH is acidic. There is no family history of
a similar illness, but her parents are first cousins.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What is the likely diagnosis?
Answer: This child most likely has genetic glucose-galactose malabsorption,
an autosomal recessive disorder.Malabsorption of these monosaccharides causes
a severe osmotic diarrhea, resulting in dehydration. Bacterial metabolism of
the unabsorbed sugar produces organic acids and results in an acidic stool pH.
Congenital deficiencies of the disaccharidases sucrase-isomaltase or lactase
have similar clinical presentations, but this child failed to improve when sucrose
or lactose were eliminated from her diet. Monosaccharide malabsorption can
also occur following certain intestinal infections, but the onset of this child&rsquo;s
symptoms at birth makes a genetic defect more likely.
</p>
<p>2. What is the molecular basis of this disorder?
Answer: Children with glucose-galactose malabsorption have impaired NaC-
dependent glucose and galactose uptake into the small intestine. Mutations
in the glucose transporter SGLT1 have been identified. The lack of glucose
and NaC uptake via SGLT1 impairs recruitment of GLUT2 to the brush-border
membrane, further impeding glucose and galactose absorption.
</p>
<p>3. What would you recommend as dietary treatment for this condition?
Answer: These children need to be placed on infant formulas that have
markedly reduced contents of glucose, galactose, disaccharides that are
hydrolyzed to glucose and galactose (lactose, sucrose), and starches or glucose
polymers. Since fructose is absorbed by a different glucose transporter (Glut5
rather than SGLT1), fructose-containing formulas are effectively absorbed and
are life-saving.</p>

<p>6 Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates and Proteins 155
</p>
<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>A 30-year-old Chinese-American man complains of excessive gas and mild chronic
diarrhea for many years. He has noted that eating ice cream and drinking milk tend
to provoke these symptoms. He is otherwise healthy, has no other GI complaints,
and has not lost weight.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What is the most likely cause of this patient&rsquo;s symptoms?
Answer: The patient most likely has adult-type hypolactasia, resulting in
malabsorption of lactose and intolerance of dairy products. The malabsorbed
lactose causes an osmotic diarrhea and is metabolized by gut bacteria to gases
such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane. Hypolactasia is extremely
common in Chinese adults. Various small-intestinal diseases, for example, celiac
sprue, can result in a reduction in brush-border lactase (secondary hypolactasia),
but this patient&rsquo;s lack of other signs or symptoms of generalized malabsorption
makes this diagnosis less likely.
</p>
<p>2. What tests could you use to make a definitive diagnosis?
Answer: Several tests have been developed to diagnose lactose malabsorption.
A standard lactose tolerance test measures the rise in blood glucose after oral
administration of lactose; the increase in blood glucose is diminished in patients
with hypolactasia. Breath-hydrogen testing is currently the most convenient
and accurate method for evaluating lactose absorption. A dose of lactose is
given orally, and breath samples are serially collected for measurement of
breath hydrogen. Individuals with lactase-persistence will digest the lactose to
the component monosaccharides, which are efficiently absorbed, and there will
be little change in breath hydrogen. Patients with hypolactasia will malabsorb
lactose, which is then metabolized by gut bacteria to hydrogen gas that is
absorbed and appears in the breath. Other tests that are used less commonly to
diagnose lactose malabsorption include intestinal biopsy with measurement of
lactase activity and assessment of the appearance of galactose in blood or
urine after oral lactose administration.
</p>
<p>3. What treatment would you prescribe?
Answer: Avoidance of lactose-containing dairy foodswill relieve the patient&rsquo;s
symptoms. Dairy foods, however, are important sources of calcium, vitamin
D, protein, and other nutrients. Some dairy foods, such as aged cheeses, have
relatively little lactose.Microbial lactases are used to prepare low-lactose milk,
and they can also be taken by mouth prior to eating dairy foods to enhance lactose
digestion and diminish GI symptoms.
</p>
<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A 7-year-old boy presents with recurrent scaly rashes on his face and arms, mild
diarrhea, and ataxia. Laboratory testing demonstrates elevated urinary and fecal
excretion of neutral amino acids, including tryptophan, and indoles. His parents
are first cousins, and testing of his family demonstrates that his brother also has
increased urinary and fecal amino acids and indoles, but is asymptomatic.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>156 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What are the diagnosis and the pathogenetic basis of this syndrome?
Answer: The child has Hartnup disease, an autosomal recessive disorder in
which there is a reduction of small intestinal and renal transport of certain neutral
amino acids, including tryptophan, causing elevated amino acid excretion in
urine and feces. The disease is caused by a mutation in the neutral amino
acid transporter SLC6A19. Malabsorbed tryptophan is metabolized by gut
bacteria to various indoles that are excreted in the feces and urine. The patient&rsquo;s
symptoms are believed to be due, at least in part, to niacin deficiency that
produces a pellagra-like syndrome, since tryptophan is a niacin precursor.
Abnormal production of serotonin in the nervous system because of reduced
tryptophan and altered protein synthesis because of amino acid deficiencies may
also contribute to the patient&rsquo;s symptoms.
</p>
<p>2. How would you explain the observation that his brother has a similar
metabolic abnormality but is asymptomatic?
</p>
<p>Answer: There are multiple amino acid transport systems in the intestinal brush-
border membrane with overlapping specificities. In addition, there is a separate
carrier for di- and tripeptides PEPT1. A defect in a single transporter therefore
is unlikely to result in a gross deficiency of essential amino acids, and most
individuals with the Hartnup abnormality are asymptomatic. It is believed that
other genetic, nutritional, or environmental factors are required in addition to
the mutation in the amino acid transporter to cause clinically apparent metabolic
abnormalities.
</p>
<p>3. What treatment would you recommend?
Answer: The clinical features of Hartnup disease, particularly the skin rash, will
sometimes respond to niacin supplementation. These children will also often
improve on a high-protein diet, which may result in the production of a large
quantity of di- and tripeptides that are taken up via PEPT1, providing a sufficient
supply of essential amino acids. Special peptide-containing formula diets that
would be efficiently absorbed in patients with Hartnup disease may also be useful
supplements for affected children.
</p>
<p>Case Study 4
</p>
<p>A 45-year-old woman complains of many years of excessive gas, bloating, flat-
ulence, and watery diarrhea. Extensive evaluation has not revealed any gastroin-
testinal disease and a lactose hydrogen breath test was normal. A review of dietary
records shows that her diarrhea and other symptoms occur when she eats fruits and
other high fructose foods.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What is the basis for her symptoms?
Answer: The patient likely has poor intestinal absorption of fructose. Studies
have shown wide variation in the efficiency of absorption of fructose in healthy</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>6 Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates and Proteins 157
</p>
<p>individuals, and fructose malabsorption can produce symptoms of the irritable
bowel syndrome. The malabsorbed fructose results in an osmotic diarrhea and is
metabolized by intestinal bacteria forming hydrogen and other gases causing the
bloating and flatulence.
</p>
<p>2. How could you make the diagnosis of fructose malabsorption?
Answer:A hydrogen breath test can be performed after fructose ingestion similar
to the breath test that is done to detect lactose malabsorption. Excessive breath
hydrogen after fructose ingestion is indicative of fructose malabsorption.
</p>
<p>3. Why is this patient able to tolerate eating large amounts of sucrose (a disac-
charide containing glucose and fructose) without developing gastrointestinal
</p>
<p>symptoms?
</p>
<p>Answer 3: Sucrose is hydrolyzed in the intestine to the monosaccharides glucose
and fructose. Some fructose is absorbed across the brush-border membrane by
the transporter GLUT-5. Glucose will be absorbed by the transporter SGLT-1.
Glucose transport by SGLT-1 initiates a signal transduction cascade that recruits
another transporter, GLUT-2, to the brush-border membrane that is a high
capacity transport system for glucose and fructose. Fructose absorption as
sucrose or when co-administered with glucose is, therefore, greater than when
fructose alone is ingested.

<p>Digestion and Absorption of Dietary
</p>
<p>Triglycerides
</p>
<p>Michael D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The mechanisms for digestion and absorption of dietary triglycerides have been
extensively studied, reflecting the importance of triglycerides in normal human
nutrition and in disease states. The Western diet contains a large amount of triglyc-
erides, typically 60&ndash;120 g/day. Normally, 95 % or more of consumed triglycerides
is digested and absorbed, providing 30&ndash;40 % of the total energy requirement. In
addition, essential polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in dietary triglycerides are
the precursors for important lipid-derived mediators such as prostaglandins and
leukotrienes involved in regulation of diverse cellular functions. The processes for
triglyceride digestion and absorption also significantly influence the efficiency of
absorption of other important dietary lipids such as cholesterol and the fat-soluble
vitamins.
</p>
<p>The stomach, liver, biliary tract, pancreas, and small intestine all participate
in normal triglyceride digestion and absorption. Inadequate triglyceride digestion
and absorption result in excessive loss of fat in the stool (steatorrhea). The presence
of steatorrhea is therefore the hallmark of a diverse group of digestive disorders
that cause malabsorption. Dietary triglycerides also play important pathogenetic
roles in some of the most prevalent diseases in Western society, including obesity,
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and several common types of cancer.

<p>Fig. 7.1 Basic structure
of triglycerides
</p>
<p>2 Structure of Triglyceride
</p>
<p>Dietary triglycerides consist of three fatty acids attached by ester linkage to a
glycerol backbone, forming triacylglycerol (Fig. 7.1). Most dietary triglycerides
are composed of various long-chain (C14-C22) saturated or unsaturated fatty acids,
with only small amounts of triglycerides containing medium-chain (C6-C12) or
short chain (less than C6) fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids tend to be
preferentially located in the 2 or &ldquo; position of the glycerol backbone.
</p>
<p>3 Triglyceride Digestion
</p>
<p>3.1 Intragastric Events
</p>
<p>Several important steps in triglyceride digestion occur within the stomach. Lipase
activity is readily detected in the gastric fluid, and in normal adult humans appears to
account for 10&ndash;30% of triglyceride hydrolysis. Lipase is produced in serous glands
at the base of the tongue or in acinar cells in pharyngeal tissue, and the lipase is
then swallowed along with the food bolus. Lingual lipase generating free fatty acids
in the mouth and pharynx may play a role in gustatory fatty acid signaling (fatty
acid taste). In humans, the lipase found in gastric fluid appears to originate mainly
within chief cells of the gastric mucosa. Secretion of gastric lipase can be stimulated
by cholinergic agents, gastrin, and possibly other gastrointestinal hormones such as
cholecystokinin. Gastric lipase has a broad pH optimum (pH 2&ndash;6) and is resistant
to pepsin and therefore active within the environment of the stomach. Gastric lipase</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7 Digestion and Absorption of Dietary Triglycerides 161
</p>
<p>emptied into the duodenum continues to be active within the environment of the
small intestine, although pancreatic lipase is the enzyme responsible for most of
the triglyceride hydrolysis (see below). Gastric lipase preferentially hydrolyzes the
ester bond in the 3 position of triacylglycerol, generating mainly fatty acids and
diglycerides.
</p>
<p>Within the stomach, there is acid-peptic digestion of the protein component
of food lipoproteins and liberation of oil droplets. The churning action of gastric
contractions against the closed pylorus results in the formation of an emulsion
containing small lipid particles (less than 2 nm) that can then be emptied from the
stomach into the duodenum. These small oil droplets with a large surface-to-volume
ratio are the preferred substrate for the colipase-pancreatic lipase enzyme system
that is responsible for the majority of triglyceride digestion in adults (see below).
</p>
<p>3.2 Hormonal Regulation of Biliary and Pancreatic Secretion
</p>
<p>As the gastric fluid empties into the duodenum, there is initiation of a coordinated
series of events designed to properly deliver biliary and pancreatic secretions into
the small intestine to continue the process of triglyceride digestion. Exposure
of the duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa to gastric acid stimulates secretion
of the peptide hormone secretin from neuroendocrine cells in the mucosa into
the portal circulation. Secretin, in turn, stimulates production of a bicarbonate-
rich fluid by the pancreatic ductular cells. Delivery of this alkaline pancreatic
fluid into the duodenum partially neutralizes the gastric acid secretion. The pH
of the upper small intestine is therefore adjusted to approximately pH 6.5, which
is optimal for the activity of the colipase-pancreatic lipase enzyme system. Fatty
acids and certain amino acids in the intestinal fluid stimulate the release of a second
peptide hormone, cholecystokinin (CCK) (also called pancreozymin) from the
mucosa into the portal circulation. CCK induces digestive enzyme secretion by the
pancreatic acinar cells, including the secretion of pancreatic lipase and colipase.
In addition, CCK also stimulates contraction of the gallbladder and relaxation
of Oddi&rsquo;s sphincter, resulting in the delivery of concentrated bile into the small
intestine. Secretin, CCK, and other hormones produced in the intestinal mucosa also
regulate gastric motility, preventing excessively rapid delivery of the food bolus
into the intestine and overwhelming of the digestive processes. For a detailed dis-
cussion of the regulation of gastric emptying, pancreatic, and biliary secretion, see
Chaps. 3, 4 and 12.
</p>
<p>3.3 Pancreatic Lipase
</p>
<p>The enzyme responsible for most of the triglyceride digestion in adult humans is
pancreatic lipase. This 449-amino-acid glycoprotein is secreted from the pancreas
in its active form. Pure pancreatic lipase has a pH optimum of pH 8&ndash;9, but in the</p>

</p>
<p>presence of bile salts the pH optimum is reduced to pH 6&ndash;7, the typical pH of the
upper small intestine. At acid pH (less than pH 4.0), pancreatic lipase is irreversibly
inactivated; therefore, neutralization of gastric acid by bicarbonate in pancreatic
juice is essential for preserving enzyme activity. Pancreatic lipase is an interfacial
enzyme that is most active at an oil-water interface and thus efficiently hydrolyzes
triglyceride present in the small lipid droplets that are emptied from the stomach into
the small intestine. In the small intestine, the oil droplets are coated on their surfaces
with bile salts, phospholipids and other compounds that inhibit the binding of pure
pancreatic lipase (Fig. 7.2). In order to achieve effective association of pancreatic
lipase with the surface of these oil droplets, a protein cofactor known as colipase
is required which forms a complex with pancreatic lipase and bile components
that associate with lipid droplets. Colipase is secreted into pancreatic fluid as a
proprotein, and an amino-terminal pentapeptide is cleaved by trypsin in the small
intestinal fluid to produce the 96-amino-acid form that can associate with the lipid
droplet. In addition, fatty acids also appear to facilitate association with pancreatic
lipase and the oil-water interface; therefore partial triglyceride hydrolysis by
gastric lipase may be an important mechanism to enhance the efficiency of the
colipase-pancreatic lipase enzyme system. The amounts of both pancreatic lipase
and pro-colipase in pancreatic fluid are increased by dietary fat and secretin, and fat
feeding increases the mRNA abundances for both pancreatic lipase and pro-colipase
in the pancreatic acinar cells.</p>

<p>7 Digestion and Absorption of Dietary Triglycerides 163
</p>
<p>Fig. 7.3 Digestion of triglyceride by pancreatic lipase (Adapted from American Gastroentero-
logical Association Teaching Slide Collection 5 &copy;, Bethesda, Maryland, slide 10; Used with
permission)
</p>
<p>Pancreatic lipase preferentially hydrolyzes the first and third ester bonds in
triglyceride, forming fatty acids and 2- or &ldquo;-monoglycerides (Fig. 7.3). The
colipase pancreatic lipase system is highly efficient, and triglyceride digestion is
nearly complete within the first 100 cm of the proximal jejunum. There is a great
excess of pancreatic lipase in pancreatic secretions, and lipase activity must be less
than 10 % of normal for triglyceride absorption to be impaired and for steatorrhea
to occur.
</p>
<p>3.4 Other Lipases
</p>
<p>In addition to pancreatic lipase, pancreatic secretions contain another lipase that
requires bile salts for activity. In contrast to pancreatic lipase, which has a high
degree of substrate specificity for triacylglycerol, bile salt-activated lipase will
catalyze the hydrolysis of carboxyl ester bonds not only in acylglycerols, but
also in other dietary fats such as cholesteryl esters, fat-soluble vitamin esters, and
phospholipids. Human bile salt-activated lipase, which has a molecular weight of
approximately 100 kd, represents about 4 % of total pancreatic juice protein. Bile
salts likely induce conformational changes in the enzyme that enhance access of the
active site to bulky lipid substrates and provide additional lipid-binding capability.
Trihydroxylated bile salts, such as cholate, taurocholate, or glycocholate, are more
potent activators than dihydroxylated bile salts, such as taurochenodeoxycholate;
and the 7a-hydroxyl group of bile salts is extremely important for activation. Bile
salt-activated lipase catalyzes the complete hydrolysis of triglyceride to fatty acids
and glycerol. Patients with congenital deficiency of pancreatic lipase or colipase</p>

</p>
<p>have been described, and although they have steatorrhea, some fat digestion and
absorption continue due to the lipolytic activities of the gastric and bile salt-activated
lipases.
</p>
<p>Human milk contains a bile salt-activated lipase that is essentially identical
to the pancreatic enzyme, differing principally in the glycosylation pattern. The
concentration of bile salt-activate lipase in milk is approximately 100mg/L. Because
of the enzyme&rsquo;s bile-salt requirement, the enzyme will not catalyze hydrolysis of
lipids in breast tissue or milk until it reaches the duodenum and is exposed to bile.
</p>
<p>In adults, pancreatic lipase has 10&ndash;60 times the lipolytic activity of bile salt-
activated lipase and is responsible for the majority of triglyceride digestion. In
the neonate and especially in premature infants, however, pancreatic function is
immature, and secretion of pancreatic lipase is inadequate to support efficient
triglyceride hydrolysis. In addition, the colipase-pancreatic lipase system is rel-
atively inefficient in digesting milk-fat globules. Milk bile salt-activated lipase
and gastric lipase (which is present in neonates at about the same level as adults),
therefore, play important roles in ensuring adequate triglyceride digestion during
early development. Other pancreatic lipase-related proteins (PLRP1 and 2) in
pancreatic juice may also play a role in neonatal triglyceride digestion. As noted
above, the generation of some fatty acids by the actions of milk bile salt-activated
lipase and gastric lipase on milk triglycerides will increase colipase binding to the
lipid droplet and to pancreatic lipase, thereby enhancing pancreatic lipase activity.
</p>
<p>3.5 Phase Contrast Studies
</p>
<p>The process of triglyceride digestion has been studied in vitro using phase contrast
microscopy (Fig. 7.4). Small oil droplets are suspended in buffer containing
concentrations of bile salts and phospholipids similar to those in intestinal fluid,
and hydrolysis is initiated by addition of pancreatic juice. Initially, one observes</p>

<p>7 Digestion and Absorption of Dietary Triglycerides 165
</p>
<p>the formation of calcium fatty acid soaps on the surface of the lipid droplet,
which, if unchecked, would limit access of colipase and lipases to the surface
of the droplet and limit further lipolysis. Formation of calcium fatty acid soaps,
however, is inhibited by &ldquo;-monoglycerides. This has been offered as a potential
teleologic explanation for the structural specificity of pancreatic lipase, as the
partial breakdown of triglyceride to fatty acids and &ldquo;-monoglyceride would limit
production of fatty acid soaps and favor continued digestion of the lipid droplet.
</p>
<p>The second, or viscous isotropic, phase involves the formation of liquid crystals
containing protonated fatty acids and monoglycerides. Continued accumulation of
fatty acids and monoglycerides on the surface of the lipid droplet, however, would
result in product inhibition of the lipases and would limit lipolysis. The products of
triglyceride digestion, however, are removed from the droplet surface by formation
of vesicles and mixed micelles (see below).
</p>
<p>4 Triglyceride Absorption
</p>
<p>4.1 Bile Salts and Micelle Formation
</p>
<p>Bile salts are a family of amphiphilic compounds that are important for the
efficient absorption of the products of triglyceride hydrolysis. At concentrations of
approximately l&ndash;5 mmol/L, bile salts form micelles, macromolecular aggregates
containing up to 20 or more bile salt molecules. These disc or spherical shaped
structures have the polar aspect of the bile salts facing the outside of the structure
and the hydrophobic portion pointing toward the interior of the micelle. Fatty acids
and other lipids are incorporated between the bile salts and in the interior of these
structures, formingmixed micelles (Fig. 7.5). This results in a remarkable increase

<p>in the solubilization of fatty acids, monoglycerides, and other lipids in the aqueous
environment of the luminal contents (Fig. 7.6). It should be noted, however, than
even in the complete absence of luminal bile salts, some fatty acid absorption
(approximately 50&ndash;75 %) still occurs. Some data indicate that unilamellar vesicles
formed in the intestinal contents at low bile salt concentrations may be a vehicle for
some fat absorption. Adequate luminal bile salt concentration for micelle formation,
however, is required for the normal highly efficient (95 % or greater) absorption of
dietary triglycerides.
</p>
<p>4.2 Uptake of Fatty Acids and ˇ-Monoglycerides
</p>
<p>into the Enterocyte
</p>
<p>Along the apical brush-border membrane surface of the enterocytes is a layer of
structured water known as the unstirred water layer. Because of hydrophobic
nature of fatty acids and &ldquo;-monoglycerides, the unstirred water layer has been
considered to represent the major permeability barrier limiting the rate of uptake
of the products of triglyceride hydrolysis into the intestinal cells. The rate of flux
of a lipid across the unstirred water layer will be determined by the product of a
diffusion rate constant and the concentration gradient (Table 7.1). Because of
their large size, the diffusion constant of mixed micelles is somewhat smaller than
that of monomeric fatty acids in solution. This, however, is more than offset by
the marked increase in the concentration of fatty acids achieved in mixed micelles
compared with that possible with monomeric fatty acids in aqueous solution.
The flux of fatty acids across the unstirred water layer in mixed micelles is therefore</p>

surface is still somewhat unclear. The most accepted theory is that the micellar fatty
acids are in equilibrium with monomeric fatty acids in the unstirred water layer and
that the monomeric fatty acids then cross the brush-border membrane.
</p>
<p>The uptake of fatty acids across the enterocyte brush-border membrane occurs
by both passive diffusion and by protein-mediated mechanisms. Protonate long
chain fatty acids diffuse across the brush-border membrane by &ldquo;flip flopping&rdquo;
through the membrane lipid bilayer down a steep concentration gradient. Several
proteins have been identified that potentially play roles in fatty acid uptake. CD36
is a 472 amino acid heavily glycosylated transmembrane protein that appears to be
involved in fatty acid uptake in many tissues. In the small intestine, it is mostly
expressed on the brush-border membranes of the duodenum and jejunum, with
little expression in the ileum or colon. Enterocytes prepared from the jejunum
of CD36 knockout mice demonstrate reduced fatty acid uptake compared with
wild-type controls. CD36 knockout mice, however, do not have significant fat
malabsorption, although fat absorption is shifted to the more distal small intestine.
Current observations indicate that CD36 mainly plays a regulatory role in intestinal
triglyceride synthesis and chylomicron production (see below). CD36 is also
expressed in lingual taste buds where is mediates perception of fatty acids, and may
be involved in satiety signaling. FATP4 is high expressed in the small intestine, but
is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and subapical membranes. It, therefore,
does not function as a true membrane transporter, but facilitates fatty acid uptake
by virtue of its acyl CoA synthase activity. This results in metabolic trapping of
fatty acids via conversion to fatty acyl CoA products that undergo rapid conversion
to complex lipids, maintaining a concentration gradient for fatty acid uptake. Other
candidate proteins involved in enterocyte fatty acid uptake (FABPpm, etc.) have
been identified, but their role has not been completely elucidated. Further research
is needed to define the relative contributions of diffusion and protein-mediated
transport to enterocyte fatty acid uptake.
</p>
<p>Studies of the intestinal uptake of &ldquo;-monoglyceride, the other major lipolytic
product, indicate that uptake is saturable and reduced by trypsin digestion of the cell
membrane, implying a role for a membrane protein in &ldquo;-monoglyceride transport.
&ldquo;-monoglyceride has been found to inhibit fatty acid uptake, suggesting coordinated
transport of these lipids.</p>

</p>
<p>4.3 Intracellular Triglyceride Transport
</p>
<p>Cytosolic Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins
</p>
<p>Within the enterocyte, the lipolytic products, fatty acids and &ldquo;-monoglycerides,
are directed to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum for resynthesis of triglyceride
and other complex lipids, such as phospholipids and cholesteryl esters. These
processes are thought to involve the association of the absorbed fatty acids with
low molecular weight cytosolic fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs). The small
intestine contains at least two cytosolic FABPs, I-FABP and L-FABP, named after
the organs (intestine and liver, respectively) in which they were first identified.
These proteins are expressed at high levels (1&ndash;2 % of cytosolic protein) and their
respective mRNAs represent about 3 % of total small-intestinal mRNA. The amino
acid structures of these proteins have been deduced from cloned DNA sequences,
and they belong to a large gene family of cytosolic lipid-binding proteins. The
mRNA abundances for both I-FABP and L-FABP increase around birth in the rat and
achieve maximal expression in the adult. Both I-FABP and L-FABP are expressed
only in villus cells, and expression is highest in the jejunum and declines distally.
</p>
<p>The roles that these cytosolic fatty acid binding proteins play in intracellular lipid
transport are uncertain, but proposed functions include:
</p>
<p>1. Removal of fatty acids from the brush-border membrane and maintenance of the
concentration gradient for fatty acid influx;
</p>
<p>2. Protection of cellular organelles from toxic effects of free fatty acids;
3. Direction of fatty acids to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum for triglyceride
</p>
<p>synthesis and
4. Targeting fatty acids toward oxidation.
</p>
<p>Mouse models with knockout of either fatty acid binding protein have normal fat
absorption, but L-FABP knockouts have reduced chylomicron secretion and I-FABP
knockout mice show weight loss compared to wild-type animals.
</p>
<p>Triglyceride Synthesis in Enterocytes
</p>
<p>Fatty acids in the enterocyte are converted to their acyl-CoA derivatives that are
used for complex lipid synthesis by enzymes that are specific for long-chain or very
long-chain fatty acids. There is evidence that the synthetase ACLS5 delivers acyl-
fatty acids for triglyceride synthesis whereas the enzymeACLS3 channels acyl-fatty
acids for phospholipid production. Within the smooth endoplasmic reticulum there
is the re-synthesis of triglyceride on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum via two
metabolic pathways (Fig. 7.7). The major pathway that accounts for approxi-
mately 75 % of triglyceride secreted from the intestine involves the generation
of diglycerides from fatty acyl-CoA and &ldquo;-monoglyceride by monoglyceride
acyltransferase (MGAT) enzymes. A minor pathway for diglyceride production</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>utilizes phosphatidic acid that is produced from &rsquo;-glycerol phosphate derived from
glycosis or absorbed glycerol. The phosphatidic acid is then dephosphorylated to
produce diacylglycerol.
</p>
<p>Fatty acyl-CoA is then transferred to diglyceride to form triglycerides by diacyl-
glycerol acyltransferases (DGATs). The intestine expresses two DGATs, DGAT1
and DGAT2. DGAT1 is thought to be responsible for most of the triglyceride
secreted from the intestine, and DGAT1 knockout mice have reduced chylomicron
triglyceride secretion. The two DGATs have different subcellular localization, with
the active site of DGAT2 facing the cytosolic side of the smooth endoplasmic
reticulum, whereas the active site of DGAT1 faces the lumen of the endoplasmic
reticulum. Some MGATs also have DGAT activity.
</p>
<p>4.4 Assembly of Chylomicrons
</p>
<p>The small intestine is the site of synthesis of several classes of lipoproteins, which
are macromolecular aggregates of lipids (triglyceride, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester,
phospholipid, etc.) and proteins known as apolipoproteins. These lipoproteins are
characterized on the basis of their flotation density, charge, and size. The core of
these lipoproteins is composed of triglyceride, cholesteryl esters, and other lipids,
whereas the apolipoproteins, phospholipid, and free cholesterol are arrayed on the
surface. Chylomicrons, the largest lipoprotein class, are responsible for delivery
of most of the absorbed triglyceride into the circulation. Two proteins are keys
to the assembly of chylomicrons in the enterocyte, apoB48 and the microsomal
triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). ApoB48 is the structural protein on the
surface of chylomicrons. MTTP facilitates chylomicron production by shuttling
triglycerides from within the endoplasmic reticulum to associate with apoB48.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>170 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>ApoB48 is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is translocated to the
endoplasmic reticulum lumen while still attached to the polysome. The amino
terminus of apoB48 contains of region for interaction with MMTP, resulting in
partial lipidation of apoB48 and organization into a primordial particle within
the ER. Optimal folding of apoB48 requires physical interaction with MMTP
which prevents apoB48 degradation. Binding of phospholipid to apoB48 also
is important for subsequent for chylomicron secretion. Additional triglyceride is
extracted from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by MMTP, and brought to
lipid droplets in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane lumen. These lipid droplets
acquire phospholipids, cholesterol, and apolipoproteinAIV, and subsequentlymerge
with the nascent apoB48-containing particle, resulting in expansion of the particle.
The critical role of MMTP in transfer of triglyceride to the endoplasmic reticulum
is demonstrated by the observation that MMTP knockout mice have large cytosolic
lipid droplets, but no lipid droplets in the endoplasmic reticulum.
</p>
<p>MMTP is a 97 kDa heterodimeric protein that is complexedwith the endoplasmic
reticulum chaperone protein disulfide isomerase. In addition to its primary role of
transferring triglycerides to apoB48, MTTP also shuttles other lipid classes such
as cholesteryl esters, free cholesterol, and phospholipids for lipoprotein formation.
Loss of function mutations of MMTP results in the disease abetalipoproteinemia,
an autosomal recessive disorder in which the heterozygous parents have normal
plasma apoB levels. Affected children have very low plasma apo B, mild fat
malabsorption, accumulation of triglyceridewithin enterocytes and hepatocytes, and
neurologic and hematologic abnormalities secondary to vitamin E malabsorption
and deficiency.
</p>
<p>4.5 Intestinal Apolipoproteins
</p>
<p>The term apoB refers to two large, hydrophobic proteins that are components
of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their metabolic products. These two proteins,
products of a single gene located on chromosome 2, are denoted on a centile scale as
apo B100 and apo B48. Apo B100 is produced in the liver and is the form present on
very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and their metabolic products intermediate-
density lipoproteins (IDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Apo B100 plays
an important role in lipoprotein metabolism, as it is a ligand for the LDL receptor.
Apo B48, which corresponds to the amino-terminal 48 % of apo B100, is produced
in the intestine and is the major lipoprotein of chylomicrons.
</p>
<p>The regulation of the tissue-specific production of apo B48 in the intestine
and apo B100 in the liver has been extensively studied. In brief, the genomically-
encoded mRNA contains as CAA codon encoding glutamine, which is modified
in the intestinal transcript to UAA, an in-frame stop codon. This results in the
termination of protein synthesis and the production of the smaller molecular
form apo B48. This overall process is now referred to as apoB-mRNA editing.
Apo B-mRNA editing in the intestine is mediated by a complex that contains</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7 Digestion and Absorption of Dietary Triglycerides 171
</p>
<p>apobec-1, the catalytic deaminase, and an obligate RNA binding subunit, apobec-
1 complementation factor. Aobec-1 knockout mice that have apoB100 in their
chylomicrons have less efficient triglyceride absorption with fewer, larger chylomi-
cron particles. In addition, there is evidence that apoB48 may protect the intestine
from lipotoxicity when fat intake is high or MTTP content is reduced. ApoB-
mRNA editing has several other important functional consequences. The region
of apoB100 responsible for interaction with the LDL receptor is in the carboxyl-
terminal portion that is not present in apoB48. Apo B48&ndash;containing chylomicron
remnants are, therefore, not taken up via the LDL receptor, but instead are believed
to undergo receptor-mediated internalization predominantly into hepatocytes via
another receptor recognizing apolipoprotein, apo E. This results in significantly
different plasma half-lives of LDL (2&ndash;3 days) versus chylomicrons (30 min). The
carboxyl-terminal portion of apo B100 also contains the attachment site for another
apolipoprotein known as apo (a). This protein is a member of the plasminogen
multigene family, and attachment of apo (a) to apo B100 produces a lipoprotein
referred to as Lp(a), which is an important, genetically determined risk factor for
atherosclerotic disease.
</p>
<p>The intestine is the site of other apolipoproteins that play crucial roles in the
assembly and secretion of lipoproteins by enterocytes and are the major regulators
of the metabolism and uptake of circulating lipoproteins by peripheral tissues.
Apo AI is one of the most abundantly expressed apolipoproteins, as its mRNA
represents 1&ndash;2 % of total intestinal mRNA. Apo AI is a 243-amino-acid protein with
a molecularweight of approximately 28 kd. In addition to being an important protein
component of chylomicrons, apo AI is the major protein of plasma high density
lipoproteins (HDL). Apo AI is a cofactor for the enzyme lecithin-cholesterol
acyltransferase (LCAT), which catalyzes the esterification of plasma cholesterol.
It also has an important function in the removal of free cholesterol from cells for
incorporation and esterification in HDL and transport to the liver for catabolism
or secretion (reverse cholesterol transport). The abundance of intestinal apo AI
mRNA increases at the time of birth, presumably in connection with suckling,
and in adult animals there is a gradient of apo AI expression from the proximal
to the distal intestine. The amount of protein, however, does not appear to be
modulated by dietary fat intake. With triglyceride feeding, there is a shift of apo
AI in the enterocyte to the lipoprotein-associated fraction and an increase in apo AI
in intestinal lymph.
</p>
<p>Apo AIV is a protein of 377 amino acids with a molecular weight of about
46 kd. It is abundantly expressed in the intestine, constituting about 3 % of protein
synthesis. Apo AIV synthesis is highly-inducible by triglyceride feeding, and there
is a gradient of expression within rat intestine, with the highest level in proximal
villus cells. Apo AIV mRNA increases at birth in response to the initiation of
suckling and fat intake, followed by a decline during the suckling period. Apo AIV
increases MMTP expression, enhances intestinal triglyceride output by increasing
the size of chylomicrons, and increases apo CIII secretion. In plasma, about 25 %
of apo AIV leaves chylomicrons and is found in HDL or in the lipoprotein-free
fraction. Apo AIV can activate LCAT, but is less active than apo AI, and may</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>172 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>also participate in the transfer of apo CII, an activator of lipoprotein lipase, from
HDL to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Apo AIV also appears to function as an acute
satiety factor.
</p>
<p>Apo CIII functions as an inhibitor of lipolysis of circulating triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins, chylomicrons, and VLDL. Apo C-III displaces apo CII, an activator
of lipoprotein lipase, from the surface of these particles. Apo C-II is expressed
in the intestine, and synthesis of this protein is stimulated by triglyceride feeding.
Evidence concerning the production of other apolipoproteins, apo AII, apo CI, and
apo CII, in the intestine is somewhat conflicting, but if they are expressed, it is at
very low levels. Apo D is found mainly in HDL and functions in the exchange
of cholesteryl esters between lipoprotein species. The mRNA for apo D has been
detected in small intestine.
</p>
<p>4.6 Secretion of Chylomicrons
</p>
<p>The nascent chylomicron particles leave the endoplasmic reticulum and are trans-
ported to the Golgi for secretion into the intestinal lymphatics. Several proteins
appear to be involved in the movement of chylomicrons from endoplasmic reticulum
to the Golgi, including several COPII proteins, L-FABP, CD36, and VAMP7.
CD36 signaling via Src kinases and extracellular regulated kinases may be
important for phosphorylating proteins required for endoplasmic reticulum pro-
cessing of prechylomicron vesicles. CD36 signaling via a rise in intracellular
calcium may also influence multiple events in lipid procession and secretion.
Mutations of the SARA2 gene that codes SAR1B, one of the COPII proteins,
is associated with Anderson/chylomicron-retention disease in which enterocytes
assemble chylomicrons in the endoplasmic reticulum, but fail to transport them
through the secretory pathway, causing intestinal lipid droplet accumulation. In
the Golgi, apolipoprotein AI and other lipids are added to the particle and there
is glycosylation of apolipoproteins. Golgi organelles containing chylomicrons fuse
into secretory vesicles, which then move toward the basolateral membrane surface
of the enterocytes by a process involving microtubules. These vesicles fuse with
the basolateral membrane and release their contents to the extracellular space. The
chylomicrons enter the intestinal lacteals and subsequently are transported through
the intestinal lymphatics and into the circulation for further metabolism.
</p>
<p>As they circulate through the mesenteric lymph and subsequently in the plasma,
chylomicrons are modified by exchanging both surface and core components with
other lipoprotein classes. Apolipoproteins such as apo CII, an activator of lipopro-
tein lipase, and apoE, a regulator of cellular lipoprotein uptake, are acquired by the
chylomicrons. The enzyme lipoprotein lipase, found on capillary endothelial cells
in muscle, adipose tissue, and other tissues, hydrolyzes triglyceride within the core
of the chylomicron, forming smaller particles known as chylomicron remnants.
These remnants undergo receptor-mediated uptake, thought to be mediated via apo
E, mainly into hepatocytes, completing chylomicron metabolism.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>7 Digestion and Absorption of Dietary Triglycerides 173
</p>
<p>4.7 Intestinal Production of Other Lipoproteins
</p>
<p>The small intestine synthesizes and secretes lipoproteins corresponding in size and
density to VLDL. The protein and lipid content of these particles is similar to
that of chylomicrons, and it is possible that only the amounts of triglycerides and
other complex lipids being produced and exported determine particle size. Some
investigators, however, have presented data suggesting that intestinal chylomicrons
and VLDL have distinct pathways of intracellular assembly.
</p>
<p>The small intestine contains and secretes small amounts of LDL-sized
lipoproteins. Since these particles have a protein composition similar to intestinal
chylomicrons and VLDL and less triglyceride than phospholipid, they are thought to
represent hypolipidated VLDL. Because the small intestine does not produce apo
B100, the characteristic apolipoprotein of LDL, the gut is not felt to significantly
contribute to the circulating plasma LDL pool.
</p>
<p>HDL particles have been visualized as 6&ndash;13-nm spherical lipoproteins within
Golgi vesicles of the rat small intestine. Two populations were noted: one
containing apo AI and apo AIV as surface components, and the other containing
apo B48. These particles were composed mainly of protein and phospholipid, with
little triglyceride, and it has been speculated that they are the most under-lipidated
precursors to intestinal chylomicrons.Mesenteric lymph has been demonstrated to
contain both spherical and discoidal HDL that appears to arise by de novo synthesis
in the intestine. In addition, HDL particles can be produced following lipolysis of
chylomicrons or VLDL in the bloodstream. Figure 7.8 is a summary of assembly
and secretion of chylomicrons.
</p>
<p>5 Digestion and Absorption of Medium-Chain Triglycerides
</p>
<p>Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), containing fatty acids of 6&ndash;12 carbon chain
lengths, are present in only small amounts in the normal diet, but they are important
components of nutritional supplements used in patients with GI disorders. They are
useful therapeutic agents because the digestion and absorption of MCTs differs
significantly from that of typical long-chain dietary triglycerides.
</p>
<p>MCTs are hydrolyzed by various lipases, including gastric lipase, bile salt-
dependent lipases, and pancreatic lipase, more rapidly than are long-chain triglyc-
erides. The medium-chain fatty acids are much more water-soluble than are
long-chain fatty acids and are efficiently taken up into the enterocytes even in the
absence of intraluminal bile salts. Some MCTs can even be absorbed intact by the
small intestine without requiring prior digestion. Within the enterocytes, medium-
chain fatty acids are not utilized for the resynthesis of triglycerides and are therefore
not packaged into chylomicrons. Instead, the medium-chain fatty acids are directly
released from the enterocytes into the portal circulation, where they are rapidly taken</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 7.8 Assembly and secretion of chylomicrons. Apo B48 is synthesized in the rough endoplas-
mic reticulum (RER). The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) stabilizes apo B48, and
promotes association with some lipid (DP). Triglyceride synthesized on the smooth endoplasmic
reticulum (SER) membrane is brought by MTP to the SER lumen. The triglyceride droplet and
apo AIV merge to form a light particle (LP), which fuses with the apo B48-containing particle to
form a lipoprotein with a core of neutral lipid surrounded by a surface of apoB48, apoAIV, and
phospholipid. This particle buds from the SER, and the prechylomicron transport vesicle (PCTV)
fuses with the Golgi. Apo A1 associates to form a mature chylomicron that exits the Golgi and
fuses with the basolateral membrane for secretion (Adapted from Mansbach and Gorelick [5])
</p>
<p>up by the liver and other tissues and used as an energy source. The differences in
digestive and absorptive mechanisms between MCTs and long-chain triglycerides
are summarized in Fig. 7.9.
</p>
<p>MCTs can therefore be employed as a well-absorbed source of calories in
patients with a wide variety of GI diseases resulting in malabsorption. These
disorders include pancreatic insufficiency; intraluminal bile salt deficiency due
to cholestatic liver disease, biliary obstruction, or ileal disease or resection;mucosal
diseases with impaired intracellular lipid metabolism and chylomicron assembly;
and disorders causing obstruction of intestinal lymphatics. It must be remem-
bered, however, that MCT preparations do not contain essential polyunsaturated
fatty acids, and therefore some long-chain dietary triglycerides are required in
patients with these malabsorptive disorders.</p>

<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>A 10-year-old girl with a history of recurrent pneumonias, chronic diarrhea, and
poor growth is found to have cystic fibrosis. On a 100-g-fat diet, she is noted to
excrete 40 g of fat in the stool. Analysis of duodenal fluid obtained after stimulation
of the pancreas by injection of secretin and cholecystokinin shows undetectable
pancreatic lipase. She is started on therapy with bovine pancreatic enzyme extracts
that have been pressed into tablets given with meals and snacks; however, she
continues to have marked steatorrhea.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. Why was this form of pancreatic enzyme supplementation of little therapeu-
tic benefit?
</p>
<p>Answer: At an acid pH (less than pH 4.0), pancreatic lipase is irreversibly
inactivated. Therefore, when enzyme supplements are taken by mouth, almost
all of the lipase is inactivated by gastric acid. Because of the lack of pancreatic
bicarbonate secretion in this patient, the pH of the upper intestinal contents
will be low, and pancreatic lipase present in the intestinal lumen will not be
functioning at its pH optimum (pH 6&ndash;7).
</p>
<p>2. How would you alter the enzyme therapy to achieve better results?
Answer: The pancreatic enzyme supplements can be combined with measures
to decrease gastric acid, such as administration of sodium bicarbonate with</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>176 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>meals, or treatment with antisecretory drugs such as H2 blockers or proton-
pump inhibitors. Pancreatic enzyme preparations have been prepared in which
the enzymes are contained in pH-sensitive microspheres that do not dissolve
at acid pH but release the enzymes at neutral pH. These measures will permit
adequate delivery of active lipase into the small bowel and greatly improve
triglyceride absorption. Preparations with acid-resident microbial lipases are
being developed for clinical use.
</p>
<p>3. Why is the patient capable of absorbing some dietary triglyceride if her
pancreas is secreting minimal pancreatic lipase?
</p>
<p>Answer: Lingual and gastric lipase activity will be preserved in the patient
with cystic fibrosis and accounts for much of the dietary triglyceride digestion.
Pancreatic bile salt-activated lipase secretion will likely also be greatly dimin-
ished in this patient.
</p>
<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>A 65-year-old man presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, diarrhea,
weight loss, and jaundice. He is found to have a common bile duct cancer and
complete biliary obstruction. On a 100-g-fat diet, he is noted to have 32 g of
steatorrhea.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What is responsible for this patient&rsquo;s fat malabsorption?
Answer: Biliary obstruction in this patient will result in lack of bile salts and
phospholipids in the intestinal lumen. Bile salts are required for the solubilization
of large amounts of the lipolytic products, fatty acids and &ldquo;-monoglycerides, in
mixed micelles. Micellar solubilization results in a large concentration gradient
for fatty acid and &ldquo;-monoglyceride flux across the unstirred water layer. Bile
salts are also needed for the activation of pancreatic bile salt-activated lipase
that participates in digestion of triglyceride and other esterified lipids. Biliary
phospholipid absorption is required to supply the phospholipid component of
chylomicrons.
</p>
<p>2. A nutrition consultant recommends that the patient be put on a supplement
containing medium-chain triglycerides to encourage weight gain. What is
the rationale behind this therapy?
Answer: Medium-chain fatty acids derived from the lipolysis of medium-chain
triglycerides are quite water-soluble, even in the absence of bile salts. Medium-
chain triglyceride supplements would therefore be well-absorbed in this patient
with biliary obstruction and intraluminal bile salt deficiency.
</p>
<p>3. Would it be advisable for this patient to be on a dietary program containing
only medium-chain triglycerides and no long-chain triglycerides?
</p>
<p>Answer: This patient continues to require some long-chain dietary triglyceride,
at least 2&ndash;5 % of caloric intake. Medium-chain triglyceride preparations
will not provide essential polyunsaturated fatty acids that are the precursors
for prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other important lipid-derived regulators of
cellular function. Essential fatty acid deficiency can develop within a few weeks
of dietary deprivation.</p>

<p>A 2-year-old boy presents with diarrhea, poor growth, and multiple neurologic
deficits. He is found to have steatorrhea, very low plasma levels of apo B (both
apo B100 and apo B48), cholesterol, triglycerides, and vitamin E. His parents have
reduced plasma apoB levels, and a diagnosis of homozygous hypobetalipoproteine-
mia is made.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. Why does this child have steatorrhea?
Answer: Children with homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia have a mutation
in the apo B gene, resulting in defective apo B48 synthesis in the small intestine
and apo B100 in the liver. Apo B48 is required for the proper assembly and
secretion of chylomicrons. Intestinal biopsies of these children show enterocytes
that are packed with triglyceride. Dietary triglyceride digestion, fatty acid
absorption, and resynthesis of triglyceride in the intestine proceed normally;
however, the triglyceride cannot be properly packaged into chylomicrons for
secretion. The triglyceride is lost into the stool as the enterocytes are sloughed as
part of normal mucosal turnover.
</p>
<p>2. Why does this child have low plasma levels of both apo B-100 and apo B-48?
Answer: Apo B100 and apo B-48 are both products of a single gene. Apo B48
is produced as a result of the process of apo B-mRNA editing, where a CAA
codon is modified to UAA, an in-frame stop codon that results in the termination
of protein synthesis. Children with homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia have
a mutation in the apo B gene that causes reduced synthesis of both forms of
apo B.
</p>
<p>3. Would medium-chain triglyceride oil be a useful nutritional supplement for
this patient? Why?
</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. Absorbed medium-chain fatty acids are not utilized for the
resynthesis of triglyceride in the enterocytes and are therefore not packaged into
chylomicron particles. Medium-chain fatty acids are released from the intestine
into the portal circulation. This child with a defect in chylomicron assembly
and secretion would digest and absorb medium-chain triglycerides well, which
could provide an important source of energy.
</p>
<p>Case Study 4
</p>
<p>A 40-year-old woman presents to the doctor with chronic diarrhea, a 10 lb weight
loss, and a rash on her trunk and arms. Biopsy of the skin rash is diagnostic of
dermatitis herpetiformis, and biopsy of the small intestine shows partial loss of the
villous architecture and inflammation in the mucosa. Analysis of her stool shows
increased fecal excretion of both fatty acids and triglyceride.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What is the diagnosis of her intestinal disease?
Answer: The patient has gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease), a con-
dition in which ingestion of certain grains, such as wheat, rye, and barley,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>178 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>incites inflammation of the intestine in a patient with genetic susceptibility.
The inflammation damages the small intestinal mucosa, and often results in
malabsorption of fat and other nutrients. All patients with the skin disease
dermatitis herpetiformis have gluten-sensitive enteropathy, although it is often
milder than the damage seen in patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy who
do not have associated dermatitis herpetiformis.
</p>
<p>2. Why does this patient have increased fecal excretion of both fatty acids and
triglyceride?
</p>
<p>Answer: The damaged proximal small intestine will have reduced release of
the hormones secretin and CCK in response to a meal, resulting in diminished
secretion of pancreatic fluid and enzymes. This causes &ldquo;functional&rdquo; pancreatic
insufficiency, even though the pancreas itself is normal. Intestinal fatty acid
absorption is impaired because of the damage to the enterocytes, resulting
in a reduced small intestinal surface area and lack of the transporters, binding
proteins, and enzymes involved in fat absorption. Bacterial metabolism of
malabsorbed triglyceride in the distal bowel also contributes to the increased
fatty acid excretion.
</p>
<p>3. What is the treatment for this patient? Does she need a fat-restricted diet?
Answer: This patient should be placed on a gluten-free diet, eliminating foods
containing wheat, rye, and barley. For most individuals, this results in resolution
of the intestinal inflammation and return of the intestinal structure and function
to normal. A minority of patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy will require
treatment with immunosuppressive medication to heal the mucosal injury.
Dietary fat restriction is only needed in a small minority of patients to decrease
steatorrhea and diarrhea while the intestine heals. Dietary fat restriction is not
required in patients when the intestine has healed in response to a gluten-free
diet.

<p>Michael D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The small intestine absorbs a variety of important lipids present in the diet or
secreted in the bile using pathways similar to those for dietary triglycerides
(Chap. 7). In this chapter, the mechanisms for absorption of cholesterol, phospho-
lipid, bile acids, and the four fat-soluble vitamins will be reviewed. Absorption of
these lipids will be considered with respect to intraluminal events, mechanisms for
uptake across the brush-border membrane, metabolism within the enterocyte, and
intracellular transport and secretion; the emphasis will be on the unique features
of each lipid compound. In addition, the hepatic uptake and metabolism of the fat-
soluble vitamins will be discussed.
</p>
<p>2 Cholesterol
</p>
<p>2.1 Sources of Intraluminal Cholesterol
</p>
<p>The cholesterol present in the intestinal lumen comes from both the diet and from
endogenous sources. The typical North American diet contains 300&ndash;500 mg/day
of cholesterol. A variable portion (typically about 15 %) of dietary cholesterol is
esterified with various fatty acids. Bile provides approximately 800&ndash;1,200 mg/day
of unesterified cholesterol, and the turnover of the intestinal mucosa adds
250&ndash;400 mg/day of cholesterol to the luminal contents.

</p>
<p>The dietary and biliary cholesterol do not appear to form a single pool in the
intestinal lumen. Current data indicate that biliary cholesterol is more rapidly and
perhaps more completely absorbed than is dietary cholesterol. Furthermore, while
the jejunum absorbs more total cholesterol than the ileum, a greater fraction of
dietary cholesterol may be absorbed in the distal small bowel than occurs with
biliary cholesterol. Biliary cholesterol is secreted in micelles with bile acids and
phospholipid. In contrast, cholesteryl esters require hydrolysis, and dietary choles-
terol needs solubilization prior to intestinal absorption. Overall, approximately
30&ndash;60 % of the luminal cholesterol is absorbed.
</p>
<p>2.2 Digestion of Cholesteryl Esters
</p>
<p>Cholesteryl esters must be hydrolyzed to free cholesterol and fatty acids prior to
intestinal absorption. Pancreatic cholesterol esterase (also known as bile salt-
activated lipase) is the enzyme responsible for most of the cholesteryl ester
hydrolysis. As previously discussed (Chap. 7), this enzyme requires bile salts
(particularly glycocholate or taurocholate) for its activity; the bile salt appears
to serve as a cofactor allowing for polymerization of the enzyme monomer into
proteolysis-resistant polymers or for an activating conformational change.
</p>
<p>2.3 Solubilization of Cholesterol
</p>
<p>Cholesterol is nearly insoluble in an aqueous system, and bile salts are therefore
absolutely required for cholesterol absorption. Cholesterol is only slightly soluble
in a pure bile salt solution, but the addition of other lipids, such as phospholipid,
monoglycerides, and fatty acids, markedly increases cholesterol solubility in
mixed micelles. In the intestinal lumen, cholesterol partitions between the micellar
phase and the lipid droplets.
</p>
<p>Cholesterol in mixed micelles is in rapid equilibrium with cholesterol in
monomolecular solution. The high cholesterol concentration in the micelles
therefore ensures a maximal concentration of monomolecular cholesterol in the
unstirred water layer lining the luminal enterocyte surface.
</p>
<p>2.4 Brush-Border Membrane Cholesterol Transport
</p>
<p>Traditionally cholesterol transport across the brush-border membrane was thought
to occur by passive diffusion. It is now clear that several brush-border membrane
proteins play key roles in regulating cholesterol movement across the apical
cell membrane (Fig. 8.1). The protein Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 8.1 Intestinal sterol absorption and secretion. Sterols including free cholesterol (FC) and
free plant sterols (PS) from diet and bile are mixed with phospholipids (PL) and bile acids (BA) to
form micelles. FC and PS solubilized in mixed micelles are transported into absorptive enterocytes
via an NPC1L1-dependent and ezetimibe-inhibitable mechanism. FC is delivered to the ER for
esterification by acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase-2 (ACAT2) to form cholesterol esters (CE)
that is then packaged into nascent lipoprotein particles (nLP) and secreted as a constituent of
chylomicrons. PS and FC that escapes ACAT2 esterification may be directly transported to nascent
HDL (nHDL) through basolateral ABCA1, or back to the gut lumen via ABCG5/G8 (Adapted
from Brown and Yu [2])
</p>
<p>essential for intestinal cholesterol absorption. The gene for NPC1L1 is located on
chromosome 7 and produces two alternatively spliced transcripts coding for proteins
of 1332 and 724 amino acids; the significance of these two splice variants has not
yet been defined. The protein has 13 transmembrane domains and sites for extensive
N-glycosylation. NPC1L1 also contains a domain of about 180 amino acids that
is a consensus sterol-sensing domain. Mice in which NPC1L1 has been knocked
out demonstrate markedly reduced (&gt;70 %) cholesterol absorption. NPC1L1 is the
target of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe which is widely used in
the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia. The mechanism by which
NPC1L1 mediates brush-border cholesterol uptake is incompletely understood, but
current evidence suggests a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. NPC1L1 is found
in both the apical plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments, and
cycling between these compartments is likely regulated by cholesterol. Cellular
cholesterol depletion causes translocation of NPC1L1 to the brush-border mem-
brane, and cholesterol repletion results in movement of NPC1L1 and cholesterol
to the cell interior. Ezetimibe appears to inhibit sterol-induced internalization of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>182 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>NPC1L1 via this endocytic pathway. NPC1L1 can facilitate the transport of various
plant steroids, but with lower efficiency than cholesterol transport.
</p>
<p>The regulation of NPC1L1 is incompletely understood. Some data suggest that
cellular cholesterol availability influences NPC1L1 expression, and that activation
of many nuclear receptors play regulatory roles. Human sequence polymorphisms
in NPC1L1 have been identified that affect cholesterol absorption efficiency,
plasma LDL-cholesterol levels, and sensitivity to ezetimibe treatment. These
polymorphisms alter NPC1L1 subcellular localization, glycosylation, or protein
stability.
</p>
<p>A second complex plays a key role in the transport of cholesterol and plant sterols
from the enterocyte across the brush-border membrane into the intestinal lumen
(Fig. 8.1). ABCG5 and ABCG8 are genes on chromosome 2 arranged in a head-to-
head orientation with less than 400 base pairs between their respective start codons.
The two genes code for two distinct proteins, sterolin-1 and sterolin-2, that must
heterodimerize to transport sterols. Both proteins contain an ATP-binding sequence
near the N-terminus and six transmembrane domains, and the complex functions as
an ATP-dependent cholesterol efflux pump delivering sterols from the enterocytes
into the intestinal lumen for disposal in feces. The two proteins heterodimerize
in the endoplasmic reticulum, traffic through the Golgi, and subsequently move
to the apical plasma membrane. ABCG5 and ABCG8 undergo N-glycosylation,
and glycosylation at Asn-619 in ABCG8 is critical for proper trafficking of the
complex.
</p>
<p>The ABCG5/ABCG8 complex is largely responsible for the greater intesti-
nal absorption of cholesterol compared with a variety of dietary plant sterols.
&ldquo;-sitosterolemia is a genetic disease characterized by increased intestinal absorp-
tion and diminished biliary secretion of cholesterol and plant sterols such as
&ldquo;-sitosterol. Affected patients have accumulation of cholesterol and plant sterols in
the plasma and various tissues and often suffer from premature atherosclerotic
heart disease. &ldquo;-sitosterolemia is caused by a mutation in either ABCG5 or
ABCG8, with the majority of mutants causing impaired transport of the heterodimer
from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane.
</p>
<p>ABCG5 and ABCG8 both appear to be regulated primarily at the level of gene
transcription. The sterol-sensing transcription factorsLXR&rsquo; andLXR&ldquo; up-regulate
expression of both ABCG5 and ABCG8, and effects of other transcription factors
have been identified.
</p>
<p>Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) is thought to play a role in
cholesterol homeostasis mainly through its mediation of the selective uptake of
HDL cholesteryl esters into the liver. SR-B1, however, is also abundantly expressed
in the small intestine where it is found in both the brush-border and basolateral
membranes (Fig. 8.1). SR-B1 is expressed more in the proximal than distal small
bowel, paralleling the site of most cholesterol absorption. SR-B1 may be mediate
some cholesterol uptake across the brush-border membrane, but may have more
important roles in the intestinal uptake of circulating HDL-associated cholesterol
esters and subsequent transport across the apical membrane for disposal in the feces,
and/or the secretion of cholesterol-containing lipoproteins across the basolateral
enterocyte membrane.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 183
</p>
<p>2.5 Cholesterol Esterification, Incorporation into
</p>
<p>Lipoproteins, and Secretion
</p>
<p>Within the enterocyte, 70&ndash;90 % of the absorbed cholesterol is esterified with fatty
acids. Various lipid binding proteins may be involved in directing the absorbed
cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum. The principal enzyme responsible for
cholesterol esterification is acyl CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase 2 (ACAT2)
that is present in the endoplasmic reticulum. Sitosterol and other plant sterols are
less effective substrates for ACAT2 than cholesterol. The microsomal triglyceride
transfer protein (MTTP) transfers cholesteryl esters to the nascent chylomicron
particle, and chylomicrons are the principal lipoprotein delivering cholesterol into
the circulation. Within chylomicrons and other intestinal lipoproteins, cholesteryl
esters are incorporated into the oily lipoprotein core, whereas free cholesterol is
present on the surface of the particle.
</p>
<p>Another route of cholesterol exit from the enterocyte may be via incorporation
into HDL. A basolateral cholesterol efflux pump ABCA1 facilitates the transfer
of cholesterol to an apolipoprotein A-I acceptor molecule forming discoidal HDL
particles (Fig. 8.1). The amount of cholesterol absorbed via this pathway appears
to be small, but ABCA1 may be a key role in HDL production. Patients with
Tangier disease with mutations in ABCA1 have virtual absence of plasma
HDL and increased enterocyte cholesterol content. ABCA1 is regulated by the
transcriptional factor LXR&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>3 Phospholipid
</p>
<p>Most of the phospholipid that the intestine absorbs originates from biliary secretion
(10&ndash;20 g/day) rather than the diet (1&ndash;2 g/day). In bile, phospholipid is present
in mixed micelles along with bile acids and cholesterol. Phosphatidylcholine
is the major phospholipid in the diet and in bile along with small amounts of
phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol. In
the intestinal lumen, the phosphatidylcholine distributes between the lipid droplets
and the micellar phase, but favors the micelles.
</p>
<p>3.1 Digestion of Phosphatidylcholine
</p>
<p>The major enzyme responsible for the digestion of phosphatidylcholine is pancre-
atic phospholipase A2 (Fig. 8.2). This enzyme, which catalyzes the breakdown
of phosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidylcholine and fatty acid, is secreted as
a zymogen and activated by tryptic cleavage of an N-terminal heptapeptide.
Phospholipase A2 has a molecular weight of about 14 kd and is activated by</p>

Phospholipids are substrates
of pancreatic
phospholipase A2
</p>
<p>calcium and by bile salts. Phospholipase A2 in the intestinal brush-bordermembrane
and intracellular phospholipases within the enterocyte probably also participate in
phospholipid digestion.
</p>
<p>3.2 Absorption of Lysophosphatidylcholine
</p>
<p>Lysophosphatidylcholine can be incorporated into both mixed micelles and liquid
crystalline vesicles. Studies have also demonstrated that bile salts and lysophos-
pholipids form submicellar aggregates than can transfer lysophospholipids between
membranes. The relative contributions of these macromolecular structures to intesti-
nal lysophospholipid absorption remain to be determined. It has been traditionally
thought that lysophospholipids cross the enterocyte brush-border membrane by
passive diffusion, but some data suggest a protein-mediated uptake mechanism.
</p>
<p>3.3 Phospholipid Metabolism in the Enterocyte
</p>
<p>The absorbed lysophosphatidylcholine can be metabolized by several pathways.
Most of the lysophosphatidylcholine is reacylated to form phosphatidylcholine.
Alternatively, the lysophosphatidylcholine can be hydrolyzed to fatty acid
and 3-phosphorylcholine, or two molecules of lysophosphatidylcholine can
react to form one molecule of phosphatidylcholine and one molecule of
3-phosphorylcholine. The fatty acids formed by these reactions can be used
for triglyceride synthesis. In addition, the intestine is capable of synthesizing
phosphatidylcholine from diglyceride (derived mainly from &rsquo;-glycerophosphate)
via the Kennedy pathway.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 185
</p>
<p>In the absence of absorbed lysophosphatidylcholine, there is a marked drop in
the secretion of chylomicrons into lymph. The fatty acid composition of the phos-
phatidylcholine contained on the surface of chylomicrons is not greatly influenced
by the dietary fatty acid content, but mainly reflects the fatty acid composition of
biliary phosphatidylcholine. These data indicate that de novo phosphatidylcholine
synthesis by the enterocyte is inadequate to provide the phospholipid needed
</p>
<p>for optimal packaging and secretion of chylomicrons, and that absorbed biliary
phospholipid is preferentially utilized for chylomicron assembly.
</p>
<p>4 Bile Acids
</p>
<p>Bile acids are secreted by the liver almost exclusively as conjugated forms,
mainly as conjugates with glycine (75 %) or taurine (25 %). A small fraction of
these conjugated bile acids is absorbed in the proximal small intestine, mainly
the glycine-conjugated dihydroxy bile acids, chenodeoxycholic acid-glycine and
deoxycholic acid-glycine. These bile acids are likely protonated in the unstirred
water layer of the jejunum, which is estimated to have a pH of approximately 5,
and the protonated bile acids are then passively absorbed transcellularly. Glycine-
conjugated trihydroxy bile acids and taurine-conjugated bile acids would be
fully ionized at the small intestinal pH and therefore would not be absorbed by
this mechanism. There is also the possibility of limited paracellular absorption of
ionized and nonionized conjugated bile acids in the small bowel.
</p>
<p>Most of the conjugated bile acids, however, remain in the lumen as the intestinal
contents transit through the upper intestine, where they activate important enzymes
and solubilize lipids to ensure efficient absorption. In the ileum, there is a high-
capacity active transport mechanism for bile acids that results in the absorption of
greater than 95 % of the secreted bile acids. The conserved bile acids are delivered
via the portal blood to the liver, where they are taken up for secretion again into bile.
This enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, which occurs several times during
a meal, ensures an adequate delivery of bile acids into the intestine for highly
efficient lipid absorption independent of the rate of hepatic bile acid synthesis from
cholesterol.
</p>
<p>4.1 Ileal Bile Acid Uptake
</p>
<p>The active transport of bile acids across the ileal brush-bordermembrane is mediated
by the transport protein ASBT (gene symbol SLC10A2) (Fig. 8.3). ASBT is a
348 amino acid membrane glycoprotein with a glycosylated extracellular amino
terminus, a cytosolic carboxyl terminus, and 7 membrane spanning domains.
ASBT is an electrogenic NaC-bile acid co-transporter, with two sodium ions
transported per molecule of bile acid. The driving force for transport is the inwardly</p>

</p>
<p>directed sodium gradient. Conjugated bile acids are transported more efficiency
than unconjugated forms, and the affinity for dihydroxy bile acids is higher than
for trihydroxy bile acids. ASBT is expressed mainly in the villus cells of ileal
enterocytes, with small amounts of ASBT in the proximal intestine and colon.
The GATA4 transcription factor is essential for silencing ASBT expression in the
proximal intestine.
</p>
<p>ASBT expression is reduced by the bile acid farnesoid X receptor (FXR) that
has chenodeoxycholate and other bile acids as ligands. The uptake of bile acids,
therefore, can be altered to meet physiological requirements. ASBT is also regulated
by the PPAR&rsquo; receptor and by corticosteroids. ASBT and NaC-bile acid co-
transport is developmentally regulated in mammals as they are absent at birth and
develop in the first postnatal weeks at a variable, species-dependent rate.
</p>
<p>Inactivating mutations in ASBT cause bile acid malabsorption. Beginning in
early infancy these children have interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile
acids, chronic diarrhea, andmalabsorption of triglycerides and fat-soluble vitamins.
</p>
<p>4.2 Intracellular Transport and Export from the Enterocyte
</p>
<p>With the enterocyte bile salts associate with a 14 kDa protein called the ileal
bile acid binding protein (IBABP) in a 2:1 stoichiometric complex. IBABP is
postulated to facilitate transport of bile acids through the cell to the basolateral
membrane. IBABP may also play a role in protecting the enterocyte from the toxic
effects of high intracellular bile salt concentrations. IBABP expression is increased
by FXR and is also developmentally regulated.
</p>
<p>The movement of bile acids across the basolateral membrane occurs mainly
via the OST&rsquo;/&ldquo; hetereodimeric transporter (Fig. 8.3). OST&rsquo; is a 340 amino</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 187
</p>
<p>acid protein with an extracellular amino terminus, 7 transmembrane domains,
and an intracellular carboxyl terminus. OST&ldquo; is a 128 amino acid protein with
an extracellular amino terminus and a cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. Both sub-
units are required for trafficking to the plasma membrane and for bile acid
transport. This transport complex appears to function by sodium-independent
facilitated diffusion. OST&rsquo;/&ldquo; can transport a number of compounds in addi-
tion to bile acids, including estrone-3-sulfate, digoxin, prostaglandin E2, and
dehydroepiandstosterone-3-sulfate.
</p>
<p>OST&rsquo;/&ldquo; is also increased by FXR. Activation of FXR by bile salts decreases
ASBT expression and increases IBABP and OST˛/ˇ expression, thereby prevent-
ing intracellular bile acid accumulation.
</p>
<p>The multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3) plays a minor role in basolateral
bile acid export, but may be more important for the small amounts of modified
(glucuronidated or sulfated) bile acids present in the intestinal lumen. Multidrug
resistance protein 2 (MRP2) may mediate transport of modified bile acids across
the brush-border membrane into the intestinal lumen.
</p>
<p>4.3 Absorption of Unconjugated Bile Acids
</p>
<p>In the intestine, particularly the colon, bacteria modify bile acids in various ways.
They deconjugate bile acids by enzymatic hydrolysis of the bond linking bile acids
to their amino acid (glycine or taurine) conjugates. Further bacterial modifications
include 7&rsquo;-dehydroxylation and oxidation/epimerization of hydroxyl groups at
various sites. These modifications increase the hydrophobicity and pKA of the
bile acids, permitting some passive absorption across the intestinal epithelium. In
addition, limited amounts of unconjugated bile acids may be absorbed via the small
amounts of transport proteins expressed in the colon.
</p>
<p>Bile acids in the distal intestine and colon cause fluid and electrolyte secretion
by directly altering enterocyte and colonocyte ion transport and indirectly by
stimulating neuroendocrine mechanisms. Excessive colonic bile salts from ileal
resection or disease or other processes result in chronic diarrhea.
</p>
<p>4.4 Ileal FGF19 Secretion and Regulation of Hepatic
</p>
<p>Bile Salt Synthesis
</p>
<p>Ileal enterocytes synthesize and secrete fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19).
FGF19 is responsive to FXR. FGF19 is released into the portal circulation, and
in an endocrine manner actives fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGF4) in
hepatocytes, resulting in inhibition of bile acid synthesis. This pathway works in
conjunction with the local intrahepatic regulation of bile acid synthesis by bile salts.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>188 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>A group of patients have been described who have low circulating FGF19 levels and
chronic watery diarrhea. It appears that these patients have disordered regulation of
hepatic bile acid synthesis and an expanded bile acid pool size that overwhelms
a normally functioning ileal absorption mechanism. Excessive colonic bile acids
cause fluid and electrolyte secretion and chronic watery diarrhea.
</p>
<p>5 Vitamin A
</p>
<p>5.1 Definitions
</p>
<p>The term vitamin A denotes a family of compounds that are structurally related
to all-trans-retinol and are required for vision, growth, cellular differentiation
and proliferation, reproduction, and the integrity of the immune system. Naturally
occurring compounds such as retinol, retinaldehyde (retinal), and retinoic acid
and a large number of synthetic analogues with or without vitamin A biological
activity are termed retinoids. Retinoids vary both qualitatively and quantitatively
with respect to specific biological actions. For example, retinoic acid in contrast to
retinol cannot effectively maintain normal vision or reproductive function.
</p>
<p>5.2 Dietary Sources of Vitamin A
</p>
<p>Dietary sources of vitamin A include preformed vitamin A, present in animal
tissues largely as long-chain fatty acyl retinol esters, and certain carotenoid
pigments present in fruits, vegetables, and some animal fats that are precursors
of vitamin A. Of more than 500 carotenoids found naturally, only about 50 are
precursors of retinol. Al1-trans-ˇ-carotene is the most active on a weight basis and
the most important vitamin A precursor for humans. Because the bioavailability
of food carotenoids is less than that of retinol, due to poorer intestinal absorption
and limited conversion of carotenoids to vitamin A, 12 �g of dietary &ldquo;-carotene
and 24 �g of three other dietary carotenoids are assumed to be nutritionally
equivalent to 1 �g of retinol. The major sources of vitamin A or provitamin A in the
American diet are liver, carrots, eggs, vegetable-based soups, whole-milk products,
and fortified milk and other foods. It is estimated that on average less than one
third of total vitamin A activity comes from carotenoids, although there is certainly
considerable interindividual variation based on dietary habits and the efficiency of
carotenoid absorption and conversion to vitamin A. The roles of &ldquo;-carotene and
other carotenoids in the prevention of cancers, heart disease, and other chronic
degenerative diseases is a topic of intense current interest. Many of the physiolog-
ical effects of carotenoids are not due to their function as vitamin A precursors, but
reflect antioxidant and other properties of the carotenoids themselves.</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 8.4 Absorption and metabolism of &ldquo;-carotene and retinyl esters (Adapted from Ong [10])
</p>
<p>5.3 Digestion of Dietary Retinyl Esters
</p>
<p>As with other esterified lipids, such as cholesteryl esters, retinyl esters must be
hydrolyzed before intestinal absorption can occur (Fig. 8.4). Several pancreatic
enzymes, including pancreatic lipase, pancreatic lipase-related protein 2, and pan-
creatic bile salt-activated lipase can hydrolyze retinyl esters, with pancreatic lipase
appearing to be most important. Brush-border membrane phospholipase B (PLB)
also participates in retinyl ester hydrolysis. The relative contributions of pancreatic
and small intestinal enzymes to retinyl ester hydrolysis are currently uncertain.
</p>
<p>5.4 Uptake of Retinol and ˇ-Carotene by the Enterocyte
</p>
<p>Both retinol (formed by hydrolysis of retinyl esters) and &ldquo;-carotene are solubilized
in mixed micelles within the luminal contents. At low concentrations, retinol
is taken up by a saturable, energy-independent process that is consistent with
carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion (Fig. 8.4). A specific carrier has not yet
been identified. At higher pharmacological retinol concentrations, uptake is not
saturable and likely occurs via simple, passive diffusion. Retinol uptake is greater
in the jejunum than ileum and is greater in neonatal animals than adults, suggesting
developmental regulation of a carrier. Uptake of &ldquo;-carotene and other carotenoids
across the brush-border membrane is mediated by the scavenger receptor class B,
type 1 (SR-B1) (Fig. 8.4).</p>

<p>Fig. 8.5 Conversion of &ldquo;-carotene to vitamin A
</p>
<p>5.5 Carotene Cleavage and Retinal Reduction
</p>
<p>Within the enterocyte, carotenes are cleaved, forming retinal. Two enzymes,
&ldquo;-carotene-15,15&rsquo;-monooxygenase (BCM01) and &ldquo;-carotene-9&rsquo;,10&rsquo;-mono-
oxygenase (BCM02) can cleave carotenoids (Fig. 8.5). BCM01 cleaves carotene
centrally forming two molecules of retinal, whereas BCM02 cleaves asymmetrically
forming apocarotenals that are subsequently shortened to produce retinal. Some
intact &ldquo;-carotene is absorbed and circulates in plasma. Liver and other tissues have
the capacity to form vitamin A from carotene via BCM01. The retinal produced
from carotenes is efficiently reduced to retinol in the enterocyte (Fig. 8.4). Both
soluble and microsomal reductases have been identified. Within the enterocyte,
most of the retinal is probably bound to a specific binding protein, cellular retinol-
binding protein, type 2 or CRBP(II) (see below). The microsomal reductase
effectively utilizes retinal bound to CRBP(II) as a substrate, whereas the soluble
reductase appears to prefer free retinal.
</p>
<p>Intestinal BCM01 mRNA expression is increased when animals are fed a
retinoid-deficient diet. Polymorphisms have been identified in the human BCM01
gene that decrease the conversion of &ldquo;-carotene to vitamin A, and may explain some
of the inter-individual variability in the ability to absorb and convert proretinoid
carotenoids to retinoids.
</p>
<p>5.6 Cellular Retinol-Binding Protein, Type 2
</p>
<p>Several retinoid-binding proteins play crucial roles in the transport, metabolism, and
cellular actions of vitamin A. In the enterocyte, one of these proteins, CRBP(II),
is key in the regulation of vitamin A absorption and metabolism. CRBP(II) is a
133-amino-acid protein with one retinoid-binding site that constitutes approxi-
mately 1 % of the soluble protein in the jejunum. CRBP(II) belongs to a large
superfamily of lipid-binding proteins that includes the fatty acid-binding proteins
and another retinoid-binding protein, CRBP(I). CRBP(I) is found at low levels in
many tissues including the small intestine, but it is not thought to play a role in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 191
</p>
<p>vitamin A absorption. In adults CRBP(II) is expressed only in the small intestinal
villus epithelial cells. CRBP(II) mRNA and protein are greater in the jejunum than
ileum and increase during pregnancy and lactation. In addition to its role in the
reduction of retinal derived from carotenes, CRBP(II) also appears to regulate the
esterification of retinol within the enterocyte.
</p>
<p>5.7 Retinol Esterification
</p>
<p>Both absorbed retinol and retinol generated from carotenes are esterified in the
enterocyte with long-chain fatty acids. Palmitate, stearate, oleate, and linoleate
account for most of the esterified fatty acids in an approximate ratio of 8:4:2:1,
and this pattern is not significantly altered by changes in dietary fatty acid
composition. Two microsomal enzymes capable of esterifying retinol have been
identified. Lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) effectively esterifies CRBP(II)-
bound retinol (Fig. 8.4). This enzyme uses phosphatidylcholine as the fatty acid
donor, and the fatty acid composition of the product retinyl esters is similar to
that of position 1 of intestinal lymph phosphatidylcholine. LRAT has a low Km
for CRBP(II)bound retinol that would be appropriate for activity at a low dietary
vitamin A intake, and LRAT accounts for about 90 % of the esterification of
physiological amounts of retinol. LRAT is greater in the proximal than the distal
small bowel and is developmentally regulated in a pattern similar to CRBP(II).
Levels of these proteins increase prior to birth, remain high during suckling, and
then decline with weaning to the adult level. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1
(DGAT1), a key enzyme in triglyceride absorption, also can esterify retinol, and
plays an important role at high levels of retinol intake.
</p>
<p>5.8 Export of Vitamin A and Carotenoids from the Enterocyte
</p>
<p>Retinyl esters synthesized in the enterocyte and carotenoids that escape cleavage
are incorporated into the lipid core of chylomicrons and released into the intestinal
lymph. Retinyl esters and carotenoids appear to be inserted into chylomicrons by
the MMTP at a late state of chylomicron production. Some retinol is released from
the enterocyte into portal blood, perhaps mediated by the ABCA1 transporter in the
basolateral membrane.
</p>
<p>5.9 Hepatic Metabolism and Storage of Vitamin A
</p>
<p>Most (65&ndash;75 %) of absorbed vitamin A stays associated with the lipid core
of chylomicrons as the triglyceride in these lipoproteins is hydrolyzed, forming
chylomicron remnants. Extrahepatic uptake of retinyl esters from chylomicrons</p>

chylomicron remnants, RE retinyl esters, ROH retinol, RBP serum retinal-binding protein
</p>
<p>and chylomicron remnants in certain tissues is important in supplying vitamin A
to these cells. Chylomicron remnants are taken up by hepatocytes using several
receptor-mediated mechanisms. Once remnant-associated retinyl esters have been
taken up by hepatocytes, rapid hydrolysis occurs; multiple hepatic enzymes can
hydrolyze retinyl esters (Fig. 8.6). Retinol is transferred from hepatocytes to peri-
sinusoidal hepatic stellate cells. Cellular retinol binding protein 1 [CRBP1] is
important in the transfer of retinol to hepatic stellate cells and its subsequent
esterification. Some, but not all data, suggests the involvement of the 21 kDa serum
retinol binding protein (RBP) in this process. CRBP(I)-bound retinol is esterified
by LRAT in the hepatic stellate cells. Normally, stellate cells contain about 90 %
of liver vitamin A, and 98 % is in the form of retinyl esters. Retinyl esters are
stored within the hepatic stellate cells along with other lipids in the form of lipid
droplets.
</p>
<p>In vitamin A-deficient animals, secretion of retinol and RBP from the liver is
reduced and plasma concentrations are low. Repletion with small doses to vitamin A
to a deficient animal does not result in accumulation of retinyl esters in stellate cells;
instead, the retinol-RBP complex is rapidly secreted into the circulation. Stellate
cells from vitamin A-deficient rats have been found to have reduced CRBP(I) and
LRAT levels, a situation that may limit vitamin A storage and favor retinol-RBP
delivery into the circulation.
</p>
<p>Retinyl esters in hepatic cell lipid droplets are mobilized during dietary vitamin
A deficiency to supply peripheral tissues. Several enzymes in stellate cells can
hydrolyze retinol esters. After hydrolysis of retinyl esters, retinol is thought to be
transferred back to hepatocytes where it binds to RBP. The retinol-RBP complex is</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 193
</p>
<p>secreted from the hepatocytes into the bloodstream. This process is highly regulated
by vitamin A status, as retinol-RBP secretion is reduced in vitamin A deficiency
and restored with vitamin A repletion. The ability of stellate cells to control retinol
storage and mobilization ensures that plasma retinol is stable at about 2 �mol/L in
spite of variations in daily intake of vitamin A.
</p>
<p>5.10 Uptake and Metabolism of Retinol-RBP
</p>
<p>A detailed consideration of the uptake and metabolism of retinol by tissues other
than the intestine and liver is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, it will be
briefly considered here. In plasma, most of the retinol-RBP is reversibly complexed
with another protein, transthyretin (molecular weight, 55 kd), and this large
complex is therefore less susceptible to glomerular filtration. A transmembrane-
spanning protein STRA6 avidly binds retinol and facilitates retinol uptake into
many peripheral tissues. Cells that also express LRAT take up more retinol, indicat-
ing that conversion of retinyl to retinyl ester within the cells maintains the driving
force for retinol uptake. STRA6 is apparently a bidirectional retinol transporter
and can participate in retinol efflux from cells under certain circumstances. Muta-
tions of STRA6 result in malformations of the eye, heart, lungs, and diaphragm;
similar abnormalities are noted in the offspring of mothers with vitamin A
deficiency.
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, some retinyl esters contained within chylomicrons can
be taken up by peripheral tissues. The enzyme lipoprotein lipase that catalyzes
chylomicron triglyceride hydrolysis can also catalyze the hydrolysis of retinyl
esters and facilitate retinol uptake into certain tissues Many retinol binding proteins
have been identified in interstitial fluids and in the cytosol of various cell types,
and they appear to play important roles in regulating cellular uptake, storage, and
metabolism of retinoids. Proteins with binding specificities for retinol, retinoic acid,
and retinal have been identified. Retinoic acid is the form of vitamin A involved in
the regulation of gene transcription. Some retinoic acid is produced in the intestine
and is present at low concentration in plasma, bound to albumin. Most of the
retinoic acid in target tissues, however, appears to derive from the oxidation of
retinol in these cells. Some retinoic acid may also be synthesized from &ldquo;-carotene
in certain cells. Two families of nuclear retinoic acid receptors have now been
identified, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoid X receptor subfamilies
(Fig. 8.7). The RAR subfamily binds all-trans-retinoic acid and 13-cis-retinoic acid;
in contrast, the RXR subfamily binds 9-cis-retinoic acid. These ligand-dependent
transcription factors associate with response elements in the promoters of specific
genes, regulating transcription. Retinoid X receptors frequently form heterodimers
with other receptors, including the RAR receptors, vitamin D receptor, and
others.</p>

<p>6 Vitamin D
</p>
<p>The term vitamin D refers to a family of compounds involved primarily in the regu-
lation of mineral and bone metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency results in metabolic
bone disease, rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, characterized by
inadequate bone mineralization.
</p>
<p>6.1 Sources of Vitamin D
</p>
<p>Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is synthesized in skin from the precursor compound
7-dehydrocholesterol. Ultraviolet light of wavelengths 290&ndash;320 nm opens the &ldquo;
ring of 7-dehydrocholesterol, forming previtamin D3, which subsequently under-
goes a slow, temperature-dependent, nonenzymatic isomerization to vitamin D3.
With enough sunlight exposure, sufficient vitamin D3 can be synthesized in the
skin to meet the vitamin D requirement. The amount of sunlight needed to produce
adequate vitamin D3, however, is influenced by skin pigmentation, age, season,
distance from the equator, and conditions that filter out ultraviolet light such as
industrial pollution. Because of these factors and customs of dress that limit sun
exposure, vitamin D is considered an essential dietary nutrient.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 195
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.8 Metabolism of vitamin D
</p>
<p>The major dietary forms of vitamin D are vitamin D3 and vitamin D2
(ergocalciferol), which is formed by ultraviolet irradiation of the plant sterol
ergosterol. In mammals, these two forms of the vitamin have similar intestinal
absorption, metabolism, and cellular effects. In the United States, foods fortified
with vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 are the major dietary sources of the vitamin.
Processed cow&rsquo;s milk contains 10 �g/quart of vitamin D and is the major food
source of the vitamin for children. Small amounts of vitamin D are also present
in liver, eggs, poultry, fortified margarines, and other foods. Human milk contains
relatively little vitamin D, 0.63&ndash;1.25 �g/L.
</p>
<p>6.2 Overview of Vitamin D Metabolism and Biological Activity
</p>
<p>At normal serum concentrations, vitamin D is not physiologically active. Two
hydroxylation reactions are required to produce the active form of the vitamin,
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) (Fig. 8.8). The first step occurs in the
liver with the formation of 25-hydroxyvitaminD3 (25(OH)D3), which is the major
form of the vitamin circulating in plasma. The principal hepatic 25-hydroxylase
is the cytochrome P-450 CYP2R1. The regulation of CYP2R1 is incompletely</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>196 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>understood. 25 hydroxylase activity increases in vitamin D deficiency, but whether
the enzyme is regulated by the substrate, product, other vitamin D metabolites,
or serum calcium is unclear. The regulation of CYP2R1 is quite imprecise, as
very high plasma levels of 25(OH)D3 are seen with excessive vitamin D intake
and toxicity. 25(OH)D3 and all other vitamin D metabolites circulate in the
plasma largely bound to a specific binding protein, the serum vitamin D-binding
protein (DBP). This glycoprotein is synthesized mainly in the liver and has a
single high affinity binding site for vitamin D metabolites. 25(OH)D3 bound to
DBP is taken up by the kidney and certain other tissues by receptor-mediated
endocytosis.
</p>
<p>In the kidney, 25(OH)D3 is converted to 1,25(OH)D3, the form of the vitamin
that is biologically active in the regulation of calcium and bone metabolism.
The renal 25(OH)D3 1-hydroxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme that is highly
regulated. Enzyme activity is increased by parathyroid hormones secreted in
response to hypocalcemia. The elevated 1,25(OH)D3 level then stimulates intestinal
calcium absorption and together with parathyroid hormone enhances calcium
mobilization from bone and renal tubular calcium resorption, thereby correcting
the hypocalcemia and completing a feedback loop. 1,25(OH)2D3 production is
also regulated by two other feedback loops. FGF23 is a hormone that is secreted
by bone in response to an elevation in the serum phosphate level. FGF23 act-
ing through its receptor (FGFR) and a coreceptor (klotho) inhibits CYP27B1
in the kidney, suppresses parathyroid hormone, and like parathyroid hormone
causes phosphaturia. 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits intestinal phosphate absorption and
bone FGF23 production. 1,25(OH)2D3 also directly represses CYP27B1 tran-
scription and inhibits parathyroid hormone secretion. A variety of hormones,
including insulin, estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and growth hormone, have
also been shown to raise plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels, and these responses are
likely to be important for meeting the increased mineral requirements during
growth, pregnancy and lactation. Thus, vitamin D can be considered as a com-
ponent of a complex endocrine system geared to the defense of serum cal-
cium and phosphorus levels and to the provision of adequate minerals for bone
formation.
</p>
<p>A vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) has been identified in many tissues, including the
intestine. This receptor belongs to a large superfamily of receptor proteins involved
in transcriptional regulation, including steroid hormone, thyroid, and retinoic acid
receptors. 1,25(OH)2D3 binds to the VDR, and the complex interacts with specific
response elements in certain genes to either induce or repress transcription. Over 100
genes have been identified that are regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3, including calcium
channels, calcium-binding proteins and calcium-transporting ATPases involved in
enterocyte calcium transport. The VDR is expressed in many tissues other than the
classic target organs of intestine, bone, and kidney involved in mineral physiology.
In addition to its effects on mineral and bone metabolism, 1,25(OH)2D3 has also
been demonstrated to influence cell proliferation and differentiation in many tissues,
to modulate immune function, to alter insulin secretion, and to have other cellular</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 197
</p>
<p>effects. In addition to its regulation of gene transcription, 1,25(OH)2D3 can also
induce rapid cellular responses that do not require new mRNA synthesis.
</p>
<p>6.3 Intestinal Absorption of Vitamin D3
</p>
<p>Vitamin D is present in the diet mainly as free cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol, and
thus no intraluminal digestion is required. Vitamin D3 has limited water solubility,
but does aggregate to a micellar-like form at a concentration of about 10�8 mM/L.
At low concentrations, therefore, vitamin D3 can be absorbed in the absence of
bile salts, if the intraluminal fluid contains only small amounts of other lipids.
Under conditions reflecting the typical postprandial situation, where fatty acids,
monoglycerides, and other lipids are present at high concentrations, absorption
of vitamin D3 is highly bile salt-dependent. Bile salts are needed to solubilize
vitamin D3 in the mixed micellar phase and to prevent it from portioning into the
lipid droplets. Patients with intraluminal bile salt deficiency from cholestatic liver
disease or from ileal disease or resection causing bile salt malabsorption have very
poor absorption of dietary vitamin D3.
</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that some of the transport proteins involved in the
absorption of cholesterol and other lipids, such as SR-B1, CD-36, and NPC1L1,
facilitate intestinal vitamin D3 uptake. At high concentrations, vitamin D is likely
absorbed by passive diffusion. Most of the absorbed vitamin D3 is incorporated
into chylomicron particles and secreted into the intestinal lymph. Within the lymph,
there is transfer of the vitamin from chylomicrons to unoccupiedDBP, a process that
continues in the bloodstream. Some of the absorbed vitamin D3 is released from
the enterocyte by a nonchylomicrondependent pathway directly into the portal
venous circulation, where it associates with DBP. In the absence of luminal bile
salts, most of the absorbed vitamin D3 appears in portal blood, whereas bile salts
favor incorporation into chylomicrons.
</p>
<p>6.4 Absorption of Vitamin D Metabolites
</p>
<p>The hydroxyvitamin D metabolites 25(OH)2D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 are not signifi-
cant dietary sources, but are important as pharmacologic agents for the treatment
of metabolic bone diseases and disorders of mineral metabolism. Studies in the
rat have shown that these forms of the vitamin are more efficiently absorbed than
vitamin D3 itself and are less dependent on intraluminal bile salts and chylomicron
production and secretion. These differences likely reflect the somewhat greater
water solubility of these compounds. Clinical studies have also demonstrated that
25(OH)D3 is better absorbed than vitamin D3 in normal humans and particularly
in patients with digestive diseases causing intraluminal bile salt deficiency and
steatorrhea.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>198 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>6.5 Catabolism and Excretion of Vitamin D Metabolites
</p>
<p>Renal mitochondria also contain a 24-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP24) that
produces 24,25-dihydroxyvitarnin D3 [24,25(OH)2D3]. Factors that stimulate
the 1-hydroxylase (parathyroid hormone and low 1,25(OH)2D3) depress the
24-hydroxylase, whereas agents that inhibit the 1-hydroxylase (1,25(OH)2D3 and
low parathyroid hormone) activate the 24-hydroxylase. This reciprocal relationship
has led to the conclusion that the formation of 24,25(OH)D3 represents the initial
step in a pathway for degradation of 25(OH)D3 and for regulation of the circulating
1,25(OH)2D3 level. 24,25(OH)2D3 is further metabolized in the kidney by a side-
chain oxidation pathway that proceeds through several oxo- and keto-intermediates
and culminates in oxidation and cleavage of the side chain. When radioactive
vitamin D3, 25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3, or 1,25(OH)2D3 are injected intravenously,
most of the radioactivity is recovered in bile, with lesser amounts in urine. In bile,
the radioactivity is present in an array of lipid- and water-soluble products, probably
generated mainly by the side-chain oxidation pathway described above, including
conjugates with glucuronic acid, sulfate, and amino acids.
</p>
<p>Many extra-renal tissues, including the intestine, also express CYP27B1 and
CYP24. These enzymes in extra-renal tissues are not influenced by factors such
as parathyroid hormone that act in the kidney to control the plasma 1,25(OH)2D3
concentration, but instead are involved in the regulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 at the local
tissue level.
</p>
<p>7 Vitamin E
</p>
<p>7.1 Structure and Biological Activity
</p>
<p>Vitamin E is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant present in plasma and cellular mem-
branes. Vitamin E does not prevent the formation of carbon-centered radicals, but
because it reacts more rapidly with peroxyl radicals than do polyunsaturated fatty
acids, it traps peroxyl radicals and breaks the chain reaction of lipid peroxidation.
&rsquo;-tocopherol, the most active form of vitamin E, reacts with peroxyl radical to form
an &rsquo;-tocopheroxyl radical that is resonance stabilized and breaks the chain reaction.
Subsequently, &rsquo;-tocopherol is regenerated by ascorbic acid and potentially by other
agents such as glutathione or uric acid. Alternatively, two &rsquo;-tocopheroxyl radicals
can react together, forming a dimer, or the radical can be completely oxidized
to tocopherol quinone. Vitamin E also regulates gene expression and alters cell
signaling and proliferation.
</p>
<p>Vitamin E occurs in eight forms: ˛-, &ldquo;-, &rdquo;-, and &bull;-tocopherols (which have a
chromanol ring and a phytyl tail and differ in the number and position of methyl
groups on the ring), and ˛-, &ldquo;-, &rdquo;-, and &bull;-tocotrienols (which have unsaturated
tails) (Fig. 8.9). The eight forms of vitamin E differ considerably in their biological</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 199
</p>
<p>Fig. 8.9 Structures of tocol
and tocotrienol forms of
vitamin E
</p>
<p>activity. This is due both to differences in their intrinsic antioxidant activities and
to important differences in bioavailability. &rsquo;-tocopherol is the most important form
of the vitamin for human nutrition, accounting for about 90 % of the vitamin E in
tissues.
</p>
<p>In experimental animals, vitamin E deficiency causes many different types of
physiological impairment and tissue damage, depending on the species studied
and on dietary and other factors producing oxidant stresses. Severe vitamin E
deficiency in humans occurs mainly in premature infants and in patients with
diseases leading to impaired fat absorption. In patients with malabsorption syn-
dromes, vitamin E deficiency causes a reduced red blood cell life span, neurologic
dysfunction, and myopathies. In premature infants, deficiency has been linked
to anemia, intraventricular hemorrhage in the brain, lung disease (bronchopul-
monary dysplasia), and blindness (retrolental fibroplasia). Vitamin E nutritional
status has also been associated with development of certain cancers, heart disease,
and impaired immune responses.
</p>
<p>7.2 Dietary Sources of Vitamin E
</p>
<p>The richest sources of vitamin E in the American diet are vegetable oils (soybean,
corn, cottonseed, and safflower) and products made from these oils, such as
margarine and shortening.Wheat germ, nuts, and green leafy vegetables also contain
appreciable amounts of this nutrient. Data from studies in experimental animals and
to some extent in humans indicate that the requirement for vitamin E increases as
dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid intake increases.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>200 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>7.3 Intestinal Absorption of Vitamin E
</p>
<p>The fractional intestinal absorption of vitamin E has varied from 20 % to 80 %
in different studies. The absorptive efficiency declines with increasing dose and
is influenced by ingestion of other dietary lipids. There do not appear to be
major differences in the extent or rate of absorption of the different forms of
vitamin E. Bile salts are required for solubilization of the vitamin in mixed micelles.
Pancreatic secretions also facilitate vitamin E absorption, but this is likely due to
effects on the formation of mixed micelles rather than a specific action on dietary
vitamin E digestion or uptake. For pharmaceutical purposes, vitamin E is often
given as &rsquo;-tocopheryl acetate because of its greater stability. &rsquo;-tocopheryl acetate
is hydrolyzed prior to intestinal absorption, and only &rsquo;-tocopherol appears in the
circulation. Pancreatic and enterocyte enzymes are responsible for the hydrolysis of
&rsquo;-tocopheryl acetate.
</p>
<p>Some of the same transport proteins that mediate cholesterol absorption are
involved in vitamin E absorption. SR-B1 has been shown to mediate both the uptake
and efflux of vitamin E across the brush-border membrane. NPC1L1 is involved
in the apical membrane uptake of both &rsquo;- and &rdquo;-tocopherol. Several intracellular
vitamin E binding proteins have been identified in different tissues, but their role in
intracellular vitamin E transport in the enterocyte has not been established.
</p>
<p>Most of the absorbed vitamin E is secreted from the intestine in chylomicrons,
but some is transported via the basolateral ABCA1 transporter and incorporated
into HDL particles. Some absorption of vitamin E directly into the portal venous
circulation has been demonstrated in laboratory animals.
</p>
<p>7.4 Vitamin E Transport in Plasma, Tissue Uptake,
</p>
<p>and Catabolism
</p>
<p>As chylomicrons are metabolized in muscle, adipose tissue, and other organs, some
vitamin E is taken up by these tissues. Lipoprotein lipase plays a role in the
transfer of vitamin E. There is also movement of vitamin E from chylomicrons to
circulating high-density lipoproteins (HDL). In turn, HDL particles can transfer
the newly acquired vitamin E to all of the other plasma lipoproteins. The vitamin E
remaining in chylomicron remnants is taken up into the liver and is re-secreted in
very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). There is preferential incorporation of the
stereoisomer RRR-&rsquo;-tocopherol into nascent VLDL for secretion into the plasma,
whereas other forms of vitamin E are largely metabolized in the liver and targeted
for excretion in bile or urine. For example, &rdquo;-tocopherol is abundant in the human
diet and is absorbed as efficiently as &rsquo;-tocopherol, but relatively little is retained
in tissues. In the hepatocyte, &rsquo;-tocopherol-transfer protein (&rsquo;-TTP) has binding
specificity for &rsquo;-tocopherol, and selectively directs that form of vitamin E for
incorporation into VLDL and secretion from the liver. Mutations in the gene
encoding &rsquo;-TTP cause vitamin E deficiency and neurological abnormalities such</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 201
</p>
<p>as ataxia. Vitamin E absorption is normal in these patients, but incorporation of
vitamin E into VLDL and hepatic secretion is impaired.
</p>
<p>The &rsquo;-tocopherol secreted in VLDL can have several metabolic fates. Some
will be taken up by peripheral tissues or transferred to HDL during lipolysis of
the VLDL triglyceride, as was described previously for chylomicrons. Some &rsquo;-
tocopherol will remain associated with VLDL during its metabolism and return to
the liver with VLDL remnants or become part of low-density lipoproteins (LDL).
Cells containing the LDL receptor will efficiently take up LDL &rsquo;-tocopherol by
a receptor-mediated process. Vitamin E is also incorporated into HDL secreted
by the liver into the circulation using the ABCA1 transporter, and HDL likely
can deliver some &rsquo;-tocopherol to peripheral tissues. It should be appreciated
therefore that multiple pathways exist for supplying peripheral tissues with &rsquo;-
tocopherol, using chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, and HDL as transport vehicles. It
is not surprising therefore that in situations where one of these mechanisms is
defective, normal tissue &rsquo;-tocopherol levels are still attainable. For example,
patients with homozygous familial hypercholeserolemia, who have defective LDL-
receptor activity, do not have clinical or biochemical vitamin E deficiency.
</p>
<p>The liver is the primary site of &rsquo;-tocopherol catabolism and excretion. The
primary hepatic oxidation product is &rsquo;-tocopherol quinone, which is further
reduced to the hydroquinone. This compound is then conjugated with glucuronic
acid and excreted in bile or degraded in the kidney to &rsquo;-tocopheronic acid,
followed by conjugation and elimination in the urine. Several transporters including
SR-B1, NPC1L1, and the multidrug resistance 3 protein appear to mediate vitamin
E transport across the canalicular membrane.
</p>
<p>8 Vitamin K
</p>
<p>8.1 Structure and Biological Activity
</p>
<p>Vitamin K refers to a group of compounds that all contain a 2-methyl-l,
4-naphthoquinone-ring structure, but differ in the structure of the side chain
at the carbon 3 position (Fig. 8.10). The form found in plants, phylloquinone (also
called phytonadione, vitamin K1) contains a 20-carbon phytyl group at carbon-3.
Bacteria synthesize a family of compounds known asmenaquinones (vitamin K2)
that contain polyisoprenyl side chains 4&ndash;13 isoprenyl units long. Animal tissues
contain small amounts of both phylloquinone and menaquinones. Menadione
(vitamin K3) is a synthetic compound that has no side chain, but its water-
soluble derivatives are alkylated in the liver to biologically active menaquinones.
Menadione, however, can combine with sulfhydryl groups in membranes and cause
hemolytic anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and kernicterus in infants and, therefore,
should not be used as a therapeutic form of vitamin K.
</p>
<p>The biological function of vitamin K is to serve as an essential cofactor for
a specific post-translational modification of certain proteins in which selected</p>

</p>
<p>glutamic acid residues are transformed to &rdquo;-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues
(Fig. 8.11). Four clotting factors synthesized in liver, factors II (prothrombin),
VII, IX, and X, undergo this post-translational modification, which is required for
these factors to bind calcium and interact with phospholipid in cellular membranes.
Vitamin K deficiency is manifested clinically by defective blood coagulation and</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 203
</p>
<p>excessive bleeding; the serum of vitamin K-deficient patients contains inactive
clotting factors lacking the Gla residues. Additional proteins in liver and in other
tissues also undergo vitamin K-dependent &rdquo;-carboxylation, including proteins C
and S, which are inhibitors of coagulation, and the bone proteins osteocalcin and
matrix Gla-protein, which play a role in calcification of bone.
</p>
<p>8.2 Dietary Sources of Vitamin K
</p>
<p>Phylloquinone is the major dietary form of vitamin K. Green leafy vegetables are
the best source, providing about 100&ndash;500 �g/100 g of food. Smaller amounts of
vitamin K are present in milk and other dairy products, meats, eggs, cereals, other
vegetables, and fruits, oils, and margarine. Human milk is relatively low in vitamin
K, containing about 2 �g/L.
</p>
<p>8.3 Intestinal Absorption of Phylloquinone
</p>
<p>Phylloquinone is highly insoluble in water, and bile salts are therefore required
for solubilization in mixed micelles. Severe vitamin K malabsorption occurs in
patients with cholestatic liver diseases, and vitamin K deficiency is more common in
this group than in other gastrointestinal diseases. Pancreatic secretions also facilitate
phylloquine absorption, probably by generating fatty acids and &ldquo;-monoglycerides
that are components of mixed micelles.
</p>
<p>Studies of phylloquinone absorption in the rat demonstrated that intestinal uptake
was saturable and dependent on metabolic energy. These features suggest the
involvement of a plasma membrane transporter or intracellular binding proteins, but
these components have not been definitively identified to date. Other lipids such
as fatty acids, monoglycerides, and phospholipids have been found to influence
phylloquinone absorption in experimental animal models.
</p>
<p>Most of the absorbed phylloquinone is incorporated into chylomicrons and
transported via intestinal lymph to the circulation. Phylloquinone is taken up into the
liver as a component of chylomicron remnants, and subsequently some is secreted
from the liver in VLDL and HDL and distributed to other tissues. A portion of
the absorbed phylloquinone is released from the intestine into the portal venous
circulation.
</p>
<p>8.4 Absorption and Utilization of Menaquinones
</p>
<p>The extent to which menaquinones produced by bacteria in the GI tract are absorbed
and utilized in the vitamin K dependent&rdquo;-carboxylase reaction is very controversial.
Measurements of the vitamin K content of human liver have shown that 75&ndash;90 % of
hepatic vitamin K is in the form of variousmenaquinones, with menaquinones-7, -9,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>204 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>and -11 being the predominant forms. Hepatic menaquinones could represent
absorption of the small amount of menaquinones present in the diet or absorption
of menaquinones derived from gut bacterial production, with accumulation in the
liver due to a relatively slow turnover rate. Studies using various experimental
preparations of rat small and large intestine have demonstrated limited uptake
of menaquinones into all intestinal segments. Menaquinone-4, a minor bacterial
form, was slowly absorbed from the jejunum and appeared in both mesenteric
lymph and portal blood, whereas absorption from the colon occurred mainly into
the portal circulation. In contrast, menaquinone-9, a typical bacterial form, was
slowly absorbed from the jejunum and transferred mainly to lymph, whereas no
transfer to lymph or to the portal circulation was seen when menaquinone-9 was
administered in the colon. These data suggest therefore that menaquinones ingested
in the diet, produced by small bowel bacteria, or synthesized by colonic bacteria
can, at least to some extent, be absorbed and delivered via the mesenteric lymph
and portal blood to the circulation. In the colon, however, there is only limited
absorption of menaquinones into the portal circulation, and the absorption rate
markedly declines with an increase in the number of isoprenoid units in the side
chain. These differences likely reflect the low concentration of bile salts and the
lack of formation of chylomicrons in the colon.
</p>
<p>Studies in rats and in humans have demonstrated that consuming a vitamin
K-deficient diet rapidly causes a fall in hepatic and plasma phylloquinone, with
little change in liver menaquinones, and induces biochemical changes of vitamin
K deficiency. In some studies, however, relatively mild vitamin K deficiency was
produced, and in others the biochemical changes reverted toward normal in spite
of continuing the vitamin K-deficient diet. These data can, therefore, be interpreted
as indicating that gut bacterial vitamin K production is not sufficient to ensure
completely normal vitaminK nutritional status, but may contribute sufficiently
</p>
<p>to prevent severe deficiency. Human studies and clinical experience indicate that
clinically apparent vitamin K deficiency and bleeding rarely occurs due to dietary
lack, but is regularly seen in patients with the combination of poor dietary intake and
use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Interpretation of this observation is complicated
as some antibiotics have direct effects on coagulation independent of alteration of
gut bacterial flora.
</p>
<p>8.5 Hepatic Vitamin K Metabolism
</p>
<p>The forms of vitamin K absorbed from the GI tract have a stable quinone
structure. The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase that catalyzes the conversion
of glutamate residues to &rdquo;-carboxyglutamate residues uses the quinol form of
the vitamin (Fig. 8.12). This carboxylase also requires molecular oxygen, carbon
dioxide, and the precursor of the vitamin K-dependent protein as a substrate.
Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors contain a carboxylation recognition site
in the proprotein region that designates an adjacent glutamic acid-rich domain for</p>
<p/>

&Dagger;-carboxylated form (Adapted from American Gastroenterological Association Teaching
Slide Collection 13B &copy;, Bethesda, Maryland, slide 69; Used with permission)
</p>
<p>&rdquo;-carboxylation. This &rdquo;-carboxylation recognition site probably directly binds to
the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, which is an integral endoplasmic reticulum
membrane protein. Following &rdquo;-carboxylation, the substrate protein is released and
transported to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and secretion. During
&rdquo;-glutamyl carboxylation, the vitamin K quinol is simultaneously converted
to the vitamin K 2,3-epoxide (Fig. 8.12). Evidence indicates that the same
enzyme contains both the carboxylase and epoxidase activities. The epoxide is
then recycled by two membrane-bound enzyme activities. First, the epoxide is
reduced to vitamin K quinone by a dithiol-dependent reductase; and second, the
quinone is reduced back to the active quinol form. Again, these two reactions may
be catalyzed by the same enzyme. The warfarin-type anticoagulants are potent
inhibitors of the activities of dithiol-dependent vitamin K-epoxide reductase and
vitamin K-reductase. Vitamin K is therefore trapped in the epoxide form, resulting
in deficiency of the active quinol, reduced &rdquo;-glutamyl carboxylation, and diminished
production of active clotting factors. A secondNADPH-dependent pathway that is
relatively insensitive to warfarin exists for reduction of vitamin K to the quinol form.
In the treatment of warfarin overdose with large doses of vitamin K, vitamin K
is converted to the quinol using this alternative pathway, reversing the anticoagulant
effect.
</p>
<p>Under normal physiological conditions, 30&ndash;40 % of absorbed vitamin K is
excreted into bile as partially degraded, conjugated, water-soluble metabolites,
whereas 15 % is excreted as water-soluble forms in the urine.
</p>
<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>A 42-year-old woman with a history of Crohn&rsquo;s disease for many years had
a resection of 3 ft of terminal ileum 5 years ago. Since then, she has taken
cholestyramine, a bile salt-binding resin, for chronic diarrhea. She now complains
of diffuse bone pain, most severe in the lower back and upper legs, and is noted
to be hypocalcemic. Her serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level is 5 ng/mL (normal:
10&ndash;50 ng/mL).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>206 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. Why would a patient with an ileal resection develop vitamin D deficiency?
Answer: Patients with a resection of 3 ft of ileum have bile salt malabsorption,
diminished enterohepatic circulation, and a reduced bile salt pool. Because of
intraluminal bile salt deficiency, they have malabsorption of dietary lipids,
including vitamin D.
</p>
<p>2. Howmight the use of cholestyramine contribute to her vitamin D depletion?
Answer:Malabsorbed bile salts cause colonic fluid and electrolyte secretion and
diarrhea. A bile salt binding resin can therefore be useful in the treatment of
watery diarrhea in patients with small ileal resections (less than 3 ft), where
increased hepatic bile synthesis maintains the bile salt pool size. In patients
with larger ileal resections, increased bile salt synthesis cannot maintain a
normal pool size, cholestyramine treatment will further reduce the enterohepatic
circulation and the intraluminal bile salt concentration and will worsen lipid
malabsorption.
</p>
<p>3. Why might treatment with 25(OH)D3 orally be preferable to supplementa-
tion with vitamin D3?
</p>
<p>Answer: 25(OH)D3 has been shown to be more efficiently absorbed than
vitamin D3 in patients with ileal resections. Absorption of 25(OH)D3 is less
dependent on intraluminal bile salts, probably because it has somewhat greater
solubility in an aqueous system than does vitamin D3.
</p>
<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>A 14-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis has pancreatic insufficiency and is being
treated with enzyme replacement. Because of worsening pulmonary symptoms, he
is admitted to the hospital for intensive respiratory therapy and broad spectrum
antibiotics. At the time of admission, he has a normal prothrombin time, a serum
alkaline phosphatase that is five times normal, and serum transaminases that are
twice normal. After 1 week of treatment in the hospital, he complains of a severe
nosebleed and is now noted to have a prothrombin time of 21 s (normal, 10&ndash;13 s).
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What factors are responsible for the development of an abnormal prothrom-
bin time during his hospitalization?
</p>
<p>Answer: The patient would likely have some degree of vitamin K malabsorp-
tion due to his pancreatic insufficiency. Cystic fibrosis can also cause cholestatic
liver disease. An elevated prothrombin time, however, occurs when the level
of active &#13;-carboxylated prothrombin falls to less than 30 % of normal, a
deficit that correlates with a clinically significant bleeding risk. During the
hospitalization, he may have been eating more poorly than usual because of his
worse pulmonary symptoms. In addition, the broad-spectrum antibioticswould
alter his intestinal flora and decrease bacterial menaquinone synthesis. Although
the contribution of these menaquinones to vitamin K nutritional status is still
controversial, most data suggest that they are absorbed to some extent and may</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>8 Digestion and Absorption of Other Dietary Lipids 207
</p>
<p>provide enough vitamin K to prevent severe deficiency. Some antibiotics directly
interfere with coagulation independent of effects on gut flora.
</p>
<p>2. How does pancreatic insufficiency cause vitamin K malabsorption?
Answer: Dietary vitamin K does not require intraluminal digestion. The vitamin
K malabsorption seen in pancreatic insufficiency is likely due to abnormal
formation of mixed micelles and to the trapping of vitamin K within lipid
droplets composed of undigested triglyceride and other lipids.
</p>
<p>3. How might the patient&rsquo;s abnormal liver chemistries relate to his vitamin K
depletion?
</p>
<p>Answer: Some patients with cystic fibrosis develop cholestasis and biliary
cirrhosis due to inspissation of bile in the biliary tract. Cholestasis leads to severe
vitamin K malabsorption, as bile salts are required for solubilization of vitamin
K in mixed micelles.
</p>
<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A 70-year-old man has extensive diverticulosis of the small intestine. He complains
of chronic diarrhea, bloating, and a 20-lb weight loss. On laboratory testing, he is
noted to have 30 g/day of steatorrhea while ingesting a 100 g/day-fat diet. A bile
acid breath test is performed, in which cholyl-14C-glycine is given by mouth and
breath samples are collected for measurement of 14CO2. The patient is found to
have a markedly elevated breath 14CO2 excretion.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. How do you explain the results of the bile acid breath test?
Answer: In a normal individual, the administered cholyl-14C-glycine is effi-
ciently absorbed by the ileal NaC-bile salt cotransporter and enters the
enterohepatic circulation. In this patient with small bowel diverticuli, bacteria
proliferate in the stagnant environment of the diverticuli. These bacteria decon-
jugate the 14C-glycine and the 14C-glycine is absorbed and metabolized, forming
14CO2 that appears in the breath.
</p>
<p>2. Why would bile salt deconjugation result in fat malabsorption?
Answer: Unconjugated bile acids are, to some extent, passively absorbed by
the small bowel. Deconjugation of bile acids by bacteria in the proximal
intestine will, therefore, result in absorption of the unconjugated bile acids
in the proximal jejunum and cause a decrease in the intraluminal bile salt
concentration in the remaining small bowel. In addition, unconjugated bile acids
have limited solubility in an aqueous system and will tend to precipitate in the
luminal contents. These two factors can result in intraluminal bile salt deficiency
and fat malabsorption.
</p>
<p>3. What other disease process would give a similar bile acid breath test?
Answer: Ileal dysfunction causes bile salt malabsorption. The bile salts are
then deconjugated in the colon, and the 14CO2 is excreted in breath. Thus,
an abnormal bile acid breath test is also characteristic of patients with ileal
disease or resection. Although on average, the 14CO2 appears in the breath
earlier in patients with small bowel bacterial overgrowth than in those with</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>208 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>ileal dysfunction, intestinal transit time is so variable that this cannot be used
to reliably distinguish between these two causes of an abnormal bile salt breath
test.
</p>
<p>Case Study 4
</p>
<p>A 55-year-old woman has advanced primary biliary cirrhosis. She is jaundiced with
a serum bilirubin of 11.0 g/dl. Laboratory testing shows that she has a very low
serum retinol level.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. Why would this woman have vitamin A malabsorption?
Answer: Patients with advanced primary biliary cirrhosis have cholestasis and
intraluminal bile salt deficiency. Bile salts are required for solubilization of
retinol and carotenes in mixedmicelles, permitting efficient intestinal absorption.
Pancreatic bile salt-activated lipase is also one of the enzymes that hydrolyze
retinyl esters prior to intestinal absorption.
</p>
<p>2. What other factor would contribute to the very low serum retinol level in
this patient?
</p>
<p>Answer 2: Retinol is secreted from the liver into the circulation bound to serum
retinol binding protein (RBP). Hepatic synthesis and secretion of RBP would also
be impaired in advanced liver disease, and both serum RBP and serum retinol
levels would be low in this patient.
</p>
<p>3. What symptoms might this patient experience?
Answer 3: The patient might have visual problems, particularly poor vision
when in dim light (night blindness). She could also have a skin rash, damage
to the conjunctivae leading to eye infections and eventually blindness, immune
dysfunction, and bone disease.

<p>Absorption of Water-Soluble
</p>
<p>Vitamins and Minerals
</p>
<p>Michael D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The nine water-soluble vitamins, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid,
folate, biotin, and vitamins B6, B12, and C are a diverse group of organic compounds
that are consumed in the daily diet in microgram to milligram amounts and are
essential for normal growth, development, and maintenance of the human organism.
These compounds are generally metabolized to forms that serve as coenzymes
in various biochemical reactions; vitamin C is an exception, as it functions as an
essential water-soluble antioxidant.
</p>
<p>The mechanisms of intestinal absorption of the various water-soluble vitamins
share some important general characteristics. The vitamins are usually present
in the diet as complex coenzyme forms that must be digested intraluminally or
at the brush-border membrane surface into simpler forms prior to transport across
the intestinal epithelium. In addition, dietary vitamins are often associated with
proteins (e.g. flavoproteins), and digestion of the protein component is needed to
liberate the vitamin prior to absorption. At the low concentrations present in the
diet (typically 10�9&ndash;10�7 mol/L), transport of the vitamins across the brush-border
membrane occurs by specialized mechanisms, such as membrane carriers, active
transport systems, and membrane binding proteins and receptors, that are specific
for a particular vitamin. At higher intraluminal concentrations attained with
pharmacologic vitamin supplementation, uptake occurs via passive diffusion, either
transcellularly or through the paracellular pathway. Extensive metabolism of water-
soluble vitamins occurs within the enterocyte, and metabolism may be coupled to
the rate of uptake. Mechanisms for extrusion of the vitamins from the enterocyte are

<p>less understood, but they often involve membrane carriers and specialized transport
proteins. Table 9.1 summarizes some of the features of intestinal absorption of the
water-soluble vitamins.
</p>
<p>Essential mineral elements must also be absorbed to maintain normal physiolog-
ical function and health. The typical diet contains several hundred milligrams per
day of macrominerals such as calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride,
phosphorus, and sulfur. Microminerals or trace elements are present in smaller
amounts, ranging from a few milligrams to micrograms per day. Essential trace
elements including chromium, cobalt, copper, fluoride, iodide, iron, manganese,
molybdenum, selenium, and zinc have well-established functions in human physiol-
ogy. Other trace elements (arsenic, boron, cadmium, nickel, silicone, tin, vanadium)
have physiological functions in some species, but an essential role in human
metabolism had not been clearly defined. Minerals and trace elements are also
present in various gastrointestinal (GI) secretions and are variably reabsorbed by the
intestine. Minerals serve diverse physiological roles, including structural functions
(bone minerals), components of metalloproteins (enzymes, transporters) and as ions
involved in neurotransmission, muscle function, regulation of fluid and acid-base
balance, energy gradients, and as second messengers.
</p>
<p>Intraluminal factors substantially affect the efficiency of mineral and trace ele-
ment absorption by altering the following processes: (1) intraluminal pH; (2) redox
state of the metal; (3) formation of chelates that enhance solubility of the mineral;
(4) formation of insoluble complexes that diminish absorption; and (5) digestion of
proteins that are associated with dietary minerals. Kinetic studies of mineral uptake</p>

aFor given antagonists, a significant effect on absorption is often observed at intakes corresponding
to 5 to ten times the normal requirements (i.e. Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn) or at concentrations &gt;2&ndash;4 �mol/L

</p>
<p>across the small intestine brush-border membrane generally have been consistent
with facilitated diffusion or active transport when studied at low physiological
concentrations, although many of these putative carriers have not been definitively
identified. At higher concentrations, intestinal uptake via passive diffusion, either
paracellularly or transcellularly, becomes quantitatively more important. Within
the enterocyte, minerals often associate with intracellular ligands that play critical
roles in regulating absorption and delivery of these elements into the circulation.
Mechanisms for extrusion of minerals across the basolateral membrane into the
portal circulation are incompletely characterized, but associations with transport
proteins and other ligands are important. Effects of one mineral on the absorption of
others are commonly observed, reflecting interactions in the luminal environment
and shared mechanisms for absorption (Table 9.2). For example, high doses of zinc
interfere with copper absorption. Individuals chronically taking zinc supplements
for prevention of colds, etc. may develop copper deficiency with anemia, neutrope-
nia, and bone disease. Zinc is used in the treatment of Wilson&rsquo;s disease, a genetic
disorder characterized by diminished biliary copper excretion and copper overload.
Zinc treatment decreases intestinal copper absorption, contributing to a reduction in
body copper.</p>

minerals, and trace elements is beyond the scope of this book. In this chapter,
two water-soluble vitamins, folate and vitamin B12, and two minerals, iron and
calcium, will be considered in depth as illustrations of the important principles of
intestinal absorption of these classes of nutrients.
</p>
<p>2 Folate
</p>
<p>2.1 Structure and Biochemical Function
</p>
<p>The term folate denotes a family of compounds with nutritional properties
and biochemical structures similar to the reference compound, folic acid or
pteroylglutamic acid (Fig. 9.1). Folic acid comprises three moieties: a pteridine
linked by a methylene bridge to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and joined by
a peptide bond to glutamic acid. The coenzyme forms of folate have reduced
pteridine rings at positions 5, 6, 7, and 8 and one-carbon additions at N-5 or N-10.
In addition, naturally occurring folates are mainly in the polyglutamate form, in
which up to nine glutamate residues are conjugated via a unique &rdquo;-glutamyl bond
forming a peptide chain (Fig. 9.1).

Rosenberg [7])
</p>
<p>Folate is widely distributed in foods, with liver, yeast, leafy vegetables, legumes
and some fruits being especially rich sources. Only a few foods, such as milk and
egg yolk, contain principally monoglutamyl forms, whereas organ meats contain
mainly penta- and heptaglutamates. Folic acid is the most common form of the
vitamin in pharmaceutical preparations and has been used in much of the research
on intestinal folate absorption. A substantial amount of folate is also secreted in
bile, mainly as monoglutamyl 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and must be reabsorbed
by the intestine to maintain the normal folate economy.
</p>
<p>Folates function metabolically as coenzymes in biochemical reactions that
transfer one-carbon units from one compound to another. These reactions are
important in amino acid metabolism and in nucleic acid synthesis. Folate defi-
ciency therefore impairs cell division and alters protein synthesis, with the most
prominent effects noted in rapidly growing tissues. The most common clinical
manifestation of human folate deficiency is a macrocytic anemia, characterized
by abnormally large red blood cells (macro-ovalocytes). Hypersegmentation of
the chromatin of circulating neutrophils is also observed, and with severe folate
deficiency neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may also be present. Bone marrow
examination demonstrates abnormal precursors of red blood cells (megaloblasts),
neutrophils, and platelets resulting from defective DNA synthesis.
</p>
<p>2.2 Hydrolysis of Polyglutamyl Folates
</p>
<p>In the lumen of the small intestine, polyglutamyl folatesmust be hydrolyzed to the
monoglutamyl form before transport through the enterocyte (Fig. 9.2). Because of
the unique &rdquo;-glutamyl linkage, polyglutamyl folates are not hydrolyzed by typical
pancreatic or intestinal proteases, and specific enzymes known as folate conjugases
are required.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>216 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>In humans, folate conjugase activities are present in both the small intestinal
brush-border membrane and in an intracellular fraction composed mainly of
lysosomes. The brush-border membrane enzyme appears to be responsible for the
hydrolysis of dietary polyglutamyl folates. This enzyme has a pH optimum of pH
6.5&ndash;7.0, the typical pH of the upper small intestine, and is activated by Zn2C. The
brush-border folate conjugase is an exopeptidase that sequentially cleaves gluta-
mate residues from the end of the peptide chain, eventually producing the monog-
lutamate form. The function of the intracellular conjugase enzyme is currently
unknown. This enzyme is an endopeptidase, cleaving the polyglutamate chain
between the first and second glutamic acid residues. Intracellular conjugase has a
pH optimum of pH 4.5, and no metal requirement for this enzyme has been defined.
During folate digestion and absorption, monoglutamyl folates accumulate in the
intestinal fluid, indicating that the rate-limiting step is the absorption of monog-
lutamyl folates rather than deconjugation of polyglutamate forms. Studies have
shown that alcohol decreases brush-border conjugase activity, a factor that may con-
tribute to the high prevalence of folate deficiency in alcoholics. Several drugs have
also been shown to inhibit folate deconjugation, including the anti-inflammatory
medication sulfasalazine used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
</p>
<p>2.3 Absorption of Monoglutamyl Folates
</p>
<p>Studies of the intestinal uptake of monoglutamyl folates using different experi-
mental preparations have consistently demonstrated the presence of both saturable
and nonsaturable uptake mechanisms. Saturable uptake appears to reflect carrier-
mediated transport, whereas the nonsaturable component is due to diffusion through
the cell membrane and/or through the paracellular pathway. At physiological con-
centrations, carrier-mediated transport accounts for most of the folate absorption,
whereas diffusion predominates at high folate concentrations.
</p>
<p>Two carriers involved in intestinal folate absorption have been identified, RFC
(reduced folate carrier, the product of the SLC19A1 gene) and PCFT (the product
of the SLC46A1 gene). RFC is expressed in the intestinal cell brush-border mem-
brane and functions at neutral pH. PCFT is expressed mainly in the apical mem-
brane of jejunal enterocytes with low expression in the ileum and colon. Transport
of folate through the PCFT system is proton coupled and occurs via a folate-proton
symport using energy generated from the downhill movement of protons into
the enterocyte. It is possible that PCFT is responsible for folate absorption in the
proximal small bowel where the luminal pH is somewhat acidic, whereas RFC plays
a role in absorption of folate in the distal small intestine and colon.Mutation of the
PCFT transporter results in hereditary folate malabsorption. Folic acid, reduced
folates such as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and the antimetabolite methotrexate
(a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase) all appear to share
the same brush-border membrane carrier, with similar affinities for the transporter.
Folate uptake, however, is structure-specific, as degradation products such as PABA</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9 Absorption of Water-Soluble Vitamins and Minerals 217
</p>
<p>or glutamic acid and inactive diastereoisomers of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate do not
interact with the brush-border membrane transporter. In addition to its effect on
folate deconjugation, sulfasalazine is also a competitive inhibitor of intestinal
monoglutamyl folate transport. The mechanism of transport of folate across the
basolateral enterocyte membrane is not well understood, but some data suggest
involvement ofMDR (multidrug resistance) proteins.
</p>
<p>Bacteria in the intestine synthesize folate, with a substantial portion in
the monoglutamate form. Although the contribution of colonic absorption of
bacterially-derived folate via the RFC transporter expressed in the colonocyte
brush-border membrane to folate economy is uncertain, it is possible that it plays a
significant role in human nutrition, particularly supplying folate for colonocytes.
</p>
<p>Folate digestion and absorption are both regulated by the level of folate in the
diet. Folate deficiency causes an increase in folate conjugase and in carrier-mediated
folate transport with increased expression of PCFT and RFC. Carrier-mediated
folate transport and expression of RFC and PCFT increase as enterocytes mature
to villus cells.
</p>
<p>Some data have suggested an alternative mechanism for intestinal folate absorp-
tion in the neonate. Folate in milk is largely bound to a high-affinity folate-binding
protein. In contrast to free folate, this protein-bound folate is more avidly absorbed
in the ileum than jejunum and is not inhibited by sulfasalazine.
</p>
<p>2.4 Folate Metabolism in the Enterocyte
</p>
<p>At physiological concentrations, folic acid is largely reduced and methylated or
formylated within the enterocyte. Appearance of folate in the blood is faster after
intraluminal administration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate folate than after folic acid,
suggesting that folic acid reduction in the enterocyte via dihydrofolate reductase
may be rate-limiting. At pharmacological concentrations, unmodified folic acid
appears in the portal blood.
</p>
<p>3 Vitamin B12
</p>
<p>3.1 Structure and Biochemical Function
</p>
<p>The basic structure of vitamin B12 is illustrated in Fig. 9.3. A central cobalt
atom is surrounded by a planar corrin nucleus comprising four reduced
pyrrole rings linked together. Below the corrin nucleus is a nucleotide moiety
(1-&rsquo;-D-ribofuranosyl-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole-3-phosphate) that lies at a right
angle to the corrin nucleus and is joined to the rest of the molecule at two points:
(1) via a phosphodiester bond to a 1-amino-2 propanol group and (2) through
coordination to the central cobalt via one of its nitrogens. The various forms of</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 9.3 Structure of vitamin
B12. X, axial ligand in
coordinate linkage with
cobalt
</p>
<p>vitamin B12 have different anionic groups in coordinate linkage with the cobalt. The
coenzyme forms of the vitamin are methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin
(50-deoxyadenosylcobalmin), formed via a unique carbon-cobalt bond. Other
important forms of vitamin B12 are hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin.
</p>
<p>Vitamin B12 is synthesized only by microorganisms, and in the human diet it
is almost entirely by animal products. Strict vegetarians are therefore at increased
risk for vitamin B12 deficiency. The daily losses of vitamin B12 are, however,
very small compared with the body pool size, and 10&ndash;20 years of a deficient
diet is required to produce clinically significant depletion. Meat contains mainly
adenosyl- and hydroxocobalamin, whereas dairy products have predominantly
methyl and hydroxocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is a stable form of the vitamin
used in pharmaceutical preparations. Cyano- and hydroxocobalamin are readily
converted to the coenzyme forms by enzyme systems found in the cytoplasmic
and mitochondrial fractions. In human plasma and tissue, the predominant forms
of vitamin B12 are methylcobalamin, adenosylcobalamin, and hydroxocobalamin.
Bile contains a significant amount of vitamin B12 that is reabsorbed by the small
intestine. The importance of this enterohepatic circulation in the maintenance of
the vitamin B12 pool is indicated by the observation that patients with vitamin B12
malabsorption become deficient in only 2&ndash;3 years compared with the 10&ndash;20 years
needed for deficiency to develop in individuals who lack dietary vitamin B12, but
normally conserve biliary cobalamins.
</p>
<p>Vitamin B12 serves as a coenzyme for two important enzymatic reactions.
Methylcobalamin is required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine
(Fig. 9.4). This reaction is catalyzed by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5-methyltetra-
hydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, which utilizes 5-methyltetra-
hydrofolate as a methyl donor. This pathway is therefore important to maintain the</p>

<p>supply of both methionine and tetrahydrofolate. Tetrahydrofolate is subsequently
converted to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which donates its one-carbon unit
to deoxyuridylate, forming thymidylate and contributing to DNA synthesis.
Adenosylcobalamin is required for the isomerase reaction in mitochondria
that converts methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl CoA (Fig. 9.5).
Methylmalonyl CoA is derived from propionate and amino acids such as</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>220 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>valine, isoleucine, and threonine. In vitamin B12 deficiency, propionate and
methylmalonate accumulate and result in impaired fatty acid synthesis.
</p>
<p>The major clinical manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency are hematologic and
neuropsychiatric abnormalities. The hematologic changes are identical to those
seen in folate deficiency (see above) and are thought to be due impaired generation
of tetrahydrofolate and altered DNA synthesis. The neuropsychiatric abnormalities
may be a consequence of alterations in brain and peripheral nerve fatty acid
synthesis due to deficient methylmalonyl-CoAmutase activity, but disordered folate
and methionine metabolism may also play important roles.
</p>
<p>3.2 Intraluminal Events in Vitamin B12 Absorption
</p>
<p>In the diet, vitamin B12 is predominately protein-bound, either to transport proteins
or to the enzyme systems described above. Acid and pepsin play important roles in
the digestion of these proteins and in the release of vitamin B12 into the gastric fluid.
Individuals with reduced gastric acid and pepsin secretion are often able to absorb
pure crystalline vitamin B12 normally, but have impaired absorption of vitamin B12
contained in food.
</p>
<p>Gastric juice contains two important vitamin B12 binding proteins, haptocor-
rin (R protein-type binder) and intrinsic factor (IF). Haptocorrin is a 60&ndash;66-kd
glycoprotein present in many digestive secretions, although the haptocorrin in
gastric juice is mainly derived from the salivary gland. Vitamin B12 has a much
higher affinity for haptocorrin than for IF, particularly at low pH. The vitamin
B12 liberated from food therefore binds preferentially to haptocorrin in gastric
juice. In addition, bile contains a substantial amount of vitamin B12 bound to
haptocorrin. Both haptocorrin and IF are unaffected by acid-peptic digestion.
In contrast, pancreatic proteases do not alter IF, but modify haptocorrin to a smaller
molecular weight form that has a markedly decreased affinity for vitamin B12. In the
small intestinal fluid, therefore, vitamin B12 is rapidly and essentially completely
transferred from haptocorrin to IF (Fig. 9.6).
</p>
<p>IF is a 48&ndash;50-kd glycoprotein produced by the gastric parietal cells, the
same cell type that is responsible for acid secretion. Within the parietal cell,
immunoreactive IF can be found in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus,
and in tubulovesicles. IF secretion is stimulated by gastrin, histamine, and cholin-
ergic agonists. Following stimulation, tubulovesicles containing IF migrate to the
periphery of secretory canaliculi, and IF is then observed on the secretory microvilli.
These findings indicate that IF secretion occurs via membrane-associated vesicular
transport and fusion of the tubulovesicles with the secretory canalicular membrane.
Although IF secretion is stimulated by the same agents that induce gastric acid
secretion, these two events are regulated differently. Following stimulation, IF
secretion is rapid, perhaps due in part to wash out of preformed IF, and subsequently
declines to a much lower plateau value. The IF-mRNA level in the parietal cells
is not affected by secretagogues. In contrast, gastric acid secretion has a slower</p>

<p>time course and is sustained at a high level. Some data suggest that gastric acid
inhibits secretion of IF, accounting for the different secretory patterns. Histamine
H2-receptor blockers, such as cimetidine, substantially decrease gastric acid
but have only a slight inhibitory effect on IF secretion. The hormone secretin
decreases acid secretion, but has no effect on IF. Agents, such as omeprazole,
that block acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric HC/KC-ATPase do not alter IF
secretion.
</p>
<p>Vitamin B12 appears to fit into a hydrophobic pit of the IF protein, with the
nucleotide portion in the interior of the pit and the anionic moiety coordinated to
cobalt facing outward. Binding of vitamin B12 to IF exposes hydrophilic regions of
IF that increase binding of the IF-vitamin B12 complex to brush-border membrane
receptors.
</p>
<p>3.3 Mucosal Events in Vitamin B12 Absorption
</p>
<p>The IF-vitamin B12 complex binds to a specific receptor present in the brush-
border membrane of ileal enterocytes, but not in the proximal intestine (Fig. 9.7).
The receptor for the IF-vitamin B12 complex in the distal ileum is a 460 kDa
protein cubilin. Binding of IF-vitamin B12 to cubilin is enhanced by Ca2C and</p>

</p>
<p>possibly bile salts. Cubilin is associated with another protein amnionless (AMN)
that is involved in the localization of cubilin to the apical membrane surface and
in internalization by endocytosis of the IF-vitamin B12 complex. Mutations in
the genes coding for cubilin or amnionless result in congenital vitamin B12
malaborption (Imerslund-Grascbeck syndrome). Other proteins can associate with
cubilin and may also be involved in vitamin B12 absorption. Within the enterocyte,
the IF-vitamin B12 complex dissociates from cubilin in the endosome and reaches
the lysosome were IF is degraded to forms that poorly binding vitamin B12. The
vitamin B12 leaves the lysosome and enters the cytoplasm probably mediated by a
protein LMBD1.
</p>
<p>Vitamin B12 is released from the ileum into the portal blood bound to another
binding protein, transcobalamin II (TC-II). The mechanisms for transfer of
vitamin B12 to TC-II in the intestine are incompletely understood. TC-II is syn-
thesized by enterocytes, and a complex of vitamin B12 with TC-II could traverse
the enterocyte basolateral membrane. Evidence exists, however, for transport of
free vitamin B12 across the basolateral membrane, perhaps mediated by multidrug
resistance protein1 (MDR1). The vitamin B12 would then associate with TC-II
outside the enterocyte. The vitamin B12-TC-II complex is taken up by peripheral
tissues by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
</p>
<p>Vitamin B12 absorption in neonates may occur through a different mechanism.
Neonates have relatively low levels of IF, and in milk vitamin B12 is bound to
haptocorrin. Neonatal small intestine expresses a receptor protein known as the
asialoglycoprotein receptor. Haptocorrin-bound vitamin B12 is taken up into other
cell types, such as hepatocytes, via this receptor, and it is possible that uptake of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9 Absorption of Water-Soluble Vitamins and Minerals 223
</p>
<p>the haptocorrin-vitamin B12 complex in the neonatal intestine also occurs through
this pathway. High oral doses of vitamin B12 (about 1&ndash;2 mg) can effectively treat
patients with pernicious anemia, an auto-immune gastritis that causes IF deficiency
and vitamin B12 malabsorption. In pernicious anemia, high dose vitamin B12 could
be absorbed to a limited extent via the asialoglycoprotein receptor or an alternative
paracellular route.
</p>
<p>3.4 Schilling Test
</p>
<p>The Schilling test is used clinically to assess vitamin B12 absorption. A tracer
dose (0.5&ndash;1.0 mcg) of radioactive vitamin B12 is given orally, and 1&ndash;2 h later a large
flushing dose (1,000 mcg) of unlabeled vitamin B12 is administered intramuscularly
to saturate plasma binding sites so that most of the absorbed vitamin B12 is
excreted in the urine. If the urinary excretion of radioactivity is low (less than
8 % of the administered dose in 24 h), a second-stage test is done in which IF is
given orally along with the radioactive vitamin B12. Patients with diseases causing
diminished IF secretion, such as pernicious anemia, have reduced radioactive
vitamin B12 absorption that normalizes when given with IF. In contrast, those
with ileal disease or resection and reduced absorption of the IF-vitamin B12 complex
have diminished absorption in both parts of the Schilling test. A singlestage
absorption test has been developed in which the patient is given both 58Cocobalamin
and IF-bound 57Co-cobalamin orally, and the urinary excretion of the two isotopes
compared to distinguish between deficient IF secretion and ileal dysfunction. Tests
utilizing radioactive cobalamin incorporated into food proteins have also been
devised to more accurately assess the patient&rsquo;s capacity to absorb vitamin B12 from
food sources.
</p>
<p>4 Iron
</p>
<p>4.1 Biochemical Function
</p>
<p>Iron is an essential trace element because of its crucial roles in cellular oxida-
tive energy metabolism. Iron is a component of the oxygen-transporting pro-
teins hemoglobin and myoglobin and of specific redox enzymes. A microcytic
hypochromic anemia (small red blood cells with reduced hemoglobin) is the
most important clinical consequence of iron deficiency; however, diminished work
and school performance may be observed in depleted individuals even before the
development of anemia.Cellular iron overload, as occurs with the genetic disorder
hemochromatosis, results in oxidant damage to many tissues.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>224 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>4.2 Dietary Sources of Iron
</p>
<p>Iron is present in the diet in two forms, as a component of heme (heme iron) and
as various nonheme iron compounds. Heme iron represents about 40 % of the total
iron in animal foods, whereas essentially all of the iron in plant foods is nonheme
iron. In a typical mixed American diet, about 10 % of total iron is heme iron.
The intestinal absorption of heme iron is considerably more efficient than that of
nonheme iron, and uptake of these two forms into the enterocyte occurs via distinct
pathways (see below). From a typical daily dietary intake of 10&ndash;20 mg of mixed
heme and nonheme iron, about 10 % is absorbed by an iron sufficient individual,
replacing the daily losses of 1&ndash;2 mg and maintaining the body iron content. In iron
deficiency, the intestinal absorption of iron significantly increases. The regulation of
body iron therefore occurs principally by adjusting intestinal absorption according
to tissue requirements rather than by altering iron excretion.
</p>
<p>4.3 Intraluminal Factors in Intestinal Iron Absorption
</p>
<p>Nonheme iron is present in the diet mainly in the ferric (Fe3C) state. Ferric iron is
soluble at an acidic pH but precipitates above pH 3. Subjects with reduced gastric
acid secretion may therefore develop iron deficiency because the ferric iron is not
solubilized by an acidic pH within the stomach. Ferrous (Fe2C) iron salts are used
in pharmaceutical preparations, as ferrous iron is soluble at the nearly neutral pH of
the small-intestinal luminal fluid and is therefore more efficiently absorbed than is
ferric iron. Various compounds present in the diet or secreted into the intestine, such
as certain sugars (e.g. fructose), amino acids (e.g. histidine), amines, and polyols,
form unstable iron chelates by binding only a few of the six coordinating bonds
of iron. These complexes help keep iron soluble in the intestinal luminal fluid.
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a well-known facilitator of iron absorption. Ascorbic
acid forms an iron chelate that increases iron solubility but, more importantly,
reduces iron to the more soluble Fe2C state. The unstable iron chelates serve as iron
donors to mucins produced by the upper GI tract. One molecule of macromolecular
mucin can bind many iron atoms, and other transitional metals also bind mucins
competitively with iron. The iron complexes with mucins, which keep the iron
soluble and available in an acceptable form, and iron then undergoes uptake into the
enterocyte. Bile increases intestinal nonheme iron absorption, probably by several
mechanisms. Bile contains iron chelators and has reductants that convert Fe3Cto the
more soluble Fe2C. At concentrations below the critical micellar concentration, the
bile salt taurocholate forms a soluble complexwith Fe2C. It has also been suggested
that taurocholate may induce the formation of ion-permeable channels in the brush-
border membrane, facilitating iron uptake.
</p>
<p>Other components of the diet decrease nonheme iron absorption by precipitating
iron or by forming stable chelates that interfere with the binding of iron to mucins.
Inhibitors of iron absorption include oxalates, phytates, tannates, and carbonates.
The efficiency of iron absorption from different foodstuffs may vary tenfold because</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9 Absorption of Water-Soluble Vitamins and Minerals 225
</p>
<p>of the presence of various enhancers and inhibitors. Fe3Ccomplexed with mucin
is also reduced to Fe2Cprior to intestinal membrane transport. Reductants are
present in the diet and in bile, and the small intestinal brush-border membrane
also contributes to this process. Reductants of systemic or enterocyte origin (e.g.
ascorbate, glutathione, etc.) are secreted into the luminal fluid, and the brush-border
membrane enzyme reductase duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb) acts to reduce
Fe3Cto Fe2Cat the apical surface.
</p>
<p>Heme iron is precipitated in an acid environment, but it is soluble at the more
alkaline pH of the small intestinal fluid. Chelation is therefore not needed to
facilitate solubility, and many of the substances that enhance or inhibit nonheme
iron absorption have no effect on the absorption of heme iron. Iron is more poorly
absorbed from a dose of heme, compared with an equivalent amount of hemoglobin,
and it has been demonstrated that globin degradation products and certain amino
acids, amines, and amides inhibit heme polymerization within the intestinal lumen
and facilitate absorption.
</p>
<p>4.4 Enterocyte Iron Transport
</p>
<p>Iron is absorbed predominantly in the duodenum (Fig. 9.8). Fe2C iron is transported
across the brush-border membrane by the divalent metal transporter DMPT1,
and loss of function mutations of this transporter results in very low rates of iron
absorption and severe microcytic anemia. Following uptake into the enterocyte the
iron can have two fates. (1) It can be sequestered in the iron storage protein ferritin
that is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. Iron bound to ferritin is lost back
into the intestinal lumen as senescent epithelial cells are sloughed from the villus
tips. (2) Alternatively, iron can be transported across the basolateral membrane.
This occurs via the Fe transporter ferroportin 1 (FP1). During the process of iron
transport across the basolateral membrane, Fe2C must be oxidized to Fe3C prior to
binding to the circulating iron transport protein transferrin. The oxidation of Fe2C to
Fe3C at the basolateral membrane is facilitated by the protein hephaestin (HP). In
a state of iron deficiency, duodenal levels of Dcytb, DMPT1, and FP1 are increased
and the content of ferritin is reduced, favoring iron absorption. In contrast, iron
sufficiency results in increased duodenal ferritin and decreased levels of Dcytb,
DMPT1, and FP1 that would favor sequestration of iron in the mucosa and limit
absorption.
</p>
<p>Heme iron is taken up into the enterocyte as the intact metalloporphyrin.
Evidence exists for uptake of heme both through a specific carrier and via diffusion
through the lipid bilayer. Within the cell, iron is released from the porphyrin by
the action of the enzyme heme oxygenase and enters the circulation as inorganic
iron. Although there is no competition between heme and nonheme iron for uptake
into the intestine, there is competitive inhibition in the overall process of intestinal
absorption. This observation indicates that the inorganic iron released from heme
intracellularly binds to the same cytosolic proteins and follows the same pathway
through the cell and across the basolateral membrane as absorbed nonheme iron.</p>

<p>Fig. 9.8 Enterocyte iron transport. Fe3C is reduced to Fe2C by duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb) in
the brush-border membrane. Fe2C is transported across the brush-border membrane by the divalent
metal transporter DMPT1. Within the enterocyte, Fe2C can bind to ferritin and be lost as cells
are sloughed into the intestinal lumen, or transported across the basolateral membrane by the Fe
transporter ferroportin 1 (FP1). During transport across the basolateral membrane, Fe2C is oxidized
to Fe3C by hephaestin (HP) and binds to transferrin (Tf). Hepcidin secreted by the liver is the major
systemic regulator of iron absorption. Hepcidin binds to FP1 and induces its degradation. Hepcidin
secretion is inhibited by iron deficiency, favoring intestinal iron absorption
</p>
<p>Several iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs) have been identified in duodenal
enterocytes that interact with specific sequences in the mRNA transcripts of genes
(or iron-responsive elements, IREs), coding for the proteins involved in intestinal
iron transport. The IRP levels and binding to IREs are altered by cellular iron
content. Interaction of IRPs with IREs alters the transcription or mRNA degradation
rates of the different proteins involved in iron transport.
</p>
<p>4.5 Systemic Regulation of Iron Absorption
</p>
<p>The status of tissue iron stores in the most well-known systemic regulator of iron
absorption. In addition to iron deficiency, however, iron absorption is also increased
in chronic hypoxia and in diseases associated with ineffective erythropoiesis
(thalassemia, chronic hemolytic disease). In contrast, various inflammatory states</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9 Absorption of Water-Soluble Vitamins and Minerals 227
</p>
<p>result in diminished iron absorption.Hepcidin is a protein secreted by the liver that
is the principal regulator of iron absorption. Hepcidin secretion is inhibited by
iron deficiency and increased by iron overload. Hypoxia and anemia also decrease
hepatic hepcidin secretion. Hepcidin binds to FP1 in the duodenal enterocyte baso-
lateral membrane, inducing endocytosis of FP1 and its proteolysis in lysosomes.
The reduction of FP1 caused by hepcidin decreases iron export from the enterocyte
and limits overall intestinal iron absorption.
</p>
<p>The regulation of hepcidin secretion by iron is complex and incompletely
understood. Extracellular iron is sensed by hepatocytes via binding of the circulating
Fe3C-transferrin complex to transferrin receptors in the hepatocyte membrane. The
protein HFE is also a component of this complex, andmutation of HFE is the most
common cause of the genetic disease hemochromatosis, which causes excessive
iron absorption, iron overload and oxidative damage to many tissues. The regulation
of hepcidin occurs at the transcriptional level. In addition to the extracellular iron-
sensing mechanism, other proteins involved in the regulation of hepcidin mRNA
synthesis by iron include bone morphogenic protein 6 (BMP6) that responds to
intracellular iron, BMP receptor, down-stream signaling elements, hemojuvelin, and
others. Mutations in hepcidin, transferrin receptor 2, ferroportin, and ferritin are rare
causes of iron overload.
</p>
<p>The mediators of altered hepcidin secretion in hypoxia and anemia are not well-
understood, but likely involve signaling molecules derived from the bone marrow.
Interleukin-6 and other inflammatory mediators have been demonstrated to induce
hepcidin secretion.
</p>
<p>Duodenal enterocytes express the transferrin receptor on the basolateral
membrane. The circulating transferrin-Fe3C may form a complex with HFE and the
transferrin receptor that is taken up by endocytosis. At the acidic pH of the endocytic
vesicle, iron is released, reduced to Fe2C, and transported into the cytoplasm
probably by DMPT1. The transferrin receptor and other proteins cycle back to the
cell membrane. It is possible that iron sensing by this mechanism also regulates
duodenal iron absorption.

<p>5 Calcium
</p>
<p>5.1 Functions and Dietary Sources of Calcium
</p>
<p>The adult body contains approximately 1,200 g of calcium, with about 99 % present
as a structural element of bones and teeth. The remaining 1 % of body calcium
plays crucial regulatory roles in processes such a nerve conduction, muscle con-
traction, blood clotting, membrane permeability, Ca2C-dependent protein kinases,
and so on. Dairy products contribute more than 55 % of the average dietary calcium
intake in the United States. Other sources include leafy green vegetables, soft fish
bones, and calcium-fortified foods.</p>

<p>Fig. 9.9 Calcium absorption
</p>
<p>5.2 Pathways of Intestinal Calcium Absorption
</p>
<p>Calcium is absorbed throughout the small intestine and colon, but the highest rate
of absorption is in the duodenum. At high dietary intakes, calcium is absorbed
mainly via passive diffusion through a paracellular pathway. At low levels of intake,
however, efficient calcium absorption is achieved by a saturable, energy-dependent
transcellular pathway through the absorptive cells that is dependent on the hormonal
form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] and is most active
in the duodenum (see Chap. 8 for a brief description of vitamin D metabolism).
Transcellular calcium transport involves three separate steps: (1) entry into
the cell through the brush-border membrane down an electrochemical gradient;
(2) translocation of calcium through the enterocyte; and (3) extrusion from the
enterocyte at the basolateral membrane surface against an electrochemical gradient
(Fig. 9.9). 1,25(OH)2D3 influences each of these processes, although the detailed
mechanisms of these steps remain controversial.
</p>
<p>5.3 Calcium Entry into Enterocytes
</p>
<p>Intracellular Ca2C concentration is approximately 100 nmol/L, whereas the luminal-
fluid Ca2C concentration is about 1&ndash;10 mmol/L. In addition, the electrical potential
within the enterocyte is approximately �55 mV relative to the luminal fluid. Both
electrical and chemical gradient forces therefore favor calcium entry into the cell,
and no metabolic energy is needed for this step.</p>
<p/>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9 Absorption of Water-Soluble Vitamins and Minerals 229
</p>
<p>Much of the information concerning calcium uptake has come from studies using
highly purified brush-bordermembrane vesicles prepared from experimental animal
or human intestine. Calcium entry into these vesicles is not energy-dependent,
but shows saturation kinetics consistent with uptake via calcium transporters or
channels. The initial rate of entry of calcium into intestinal brush-border membrane
vesicles prepared from vitamin D-deficient animals is reduced compared with
vitamin D-sufficient animals; however, there is no effect on the final equilibrium
concentration, indicating that vitamin D alters the rate of, but not the capacity for,
uptake. Vitamin D-inducible calcium selective ion channels CaT1 (TRPV6) and
CaT2 have been identified in the duodenal brush-bordermembrane. CaT1 knockout
mice demonstrate reduced vitamin D-dependent intestinal calcium absorption, but
it is not completely eliminated, indicating several pathways of calcium uptake.
Evidence exists for calcium entry into the enterocyte via a mechanism involving
endocytic vesicles. The relative importance of these different pathways for calcium
entry into the enterocyte remains uncertain.
</p>
<p>5.4 Transcellular Calcium Transport
</p>
<p>Absorbed calcium must move from the brush-border membrane across the entero-
cyte to the basolateral surface for extrusion from the cell. The rate of free Ca2C
</p>
<p>flux across the enterocyte has been estimated from the cell size, the presumed
transcellular concentration gradient, and the diffusion constant of Ca2C in water.
The estimated value is two orders of magnitude slower than the observed absorption
rate. Three possible mechanisms have been suggested for facilitating movement
of calcium across the enterocyte: (1) intracellular facilitated diffusion involving
binding of calcium to a calcium-binding protein, calbindin-D; (2) calcium transport
in fixed intracellular organelles; and (3) vesicular transport involving endosomes,
lysosomes, and the cytoskeleton.
</p>
<p>In the intestine, 1,25(OH)2D3 induces the synthesis of the vitamin D-dependent
calcium-binding protein calbindin-D, In mammals, calbindin-D is a 9-kd protein,
whereas in avian intestine it is present as a 28-kd protein. In general, there is a linear
relationship between intestinal calbindin-D content and the calcium absorption rate.
In addition, calbindin-D is more abundant in the proximal small bowel than in the
ileum, paralleling the calcium absorption rates. It is postulated that calbindin-D acts
as an intracellular carrier to facilitate movement of calcium through the cell by
greatly increasing the transcellular calcium gradient. Based on a calbindin-D
concentration of 100 �mol/L, an intracellular Ca2C concentration of 100 nmol/L,
a diffusion coefficient for calbindin-bound calcium equal to 0.15 of the value for
free calcium, and two calcium-binding sites on calbindin-D, it has been calculated
that this binding protein would cause a 75-fold increase of transport beyond that
of free Ca2C ion, a value nearly identical to the experimentally measured rate.
Recent studies of calbindin-D9K knockout mice, however, have shown no significant</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>230 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>reduction of calcium absorption compared to wild type controls, indicating that
calbindin-D9K is not essential for vitamin D-dependent calcium absorption.
</p>
<p>Some studies reported vitamin D-stimulated binding of calcium to intracellular
organelles such as Golgi apparatus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, or mitochondria,
but these remain controversial. Vitamin D-dependent calcium transport has been
observed in isolated Golgi membranes.
</p>
<p>Recent research has suggested that much of vitamin D-dependent calcium
absorption occurs via a vesicular pathway involving sequestration of calcium
in endocytic vesicles, fusion of these endosomes with lysosomes, movement of
vesicles and lysosomes along microtubules to the basolateral cell surface, and
exocytosis from the enterocyte. Calbindin-D has been found within vesicles in
the enterocytes, perhaps explaining their avidity for calcium. During calcium
absorption, calbindin-D has been reported to decrease in the enterocyte and to
appear in the core of the villus, suggesting extrusion from the cell along with the
calcium. Some researchers have suggested that this vesicular transport pathway is
initiated by a 1,25(OH)2D3-induced rise in intracellular Ca2C concentration and
activation of cellular protein kinases.
</p>
<p>5.5 Calcium Extrusion
</p>
<p>Calcium is extruded from the basolateral enterocyte surface against a steep electro-
chemical gradient requiring metabolic energy. As in many cell types, enterocytes
and colonocytes contain an ATP-dependent calcium pump in the basolateral
membrane called the calcium-transporting ATPase. This transport activity is
correlated with intestinal calcium absorption, as it is greater in the proximal than
distal bowel and greater in villus than crypt cells, and declines with aging. The
calcium-binding affinity of the calcium-transporting ATPase is about 2.5 times
that of calbindin-D, providing a gradient of binding affinities from brush-border
membrane to basolateral membrane that favors vectorial transport. Studies with
basolateral membrane vesicles have shown that calcium pump activity is stimulated
by 1,25(OH)2D3. Kinetic analyses showed that this was due to an increase in
transport capacity, with no change in affinity. In vitamin D-replete animals,
the calcium-pumping rate is greater than the calcium absorption rate, indicating
that pump activity can accommodate the active calcium transport process. In
vitamin D deficiency, however, pump activity could be rate-limiting, and treatment
of vitamin D-deficient animals with 1,25(OH)2D3 has been shown to increase
immunodetectable pumps in the basolateral membrane.
</p>
<p>At least four genes coding for plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPases
have been identified, and the diversity of pump proteins is further increased by
alternative splicing of these gene transcripts. Different isoforms of the calcium-
transporting ATPase are found in the small intestine and colon. Enterocytes contain
a basolateral NaC/Ca2C exchange system, but this system is not regulated by</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9 Absorption of Water-Soluble Vitamins and Minerals 231
</p>
<p>vitamin D, does not vary along the length of the small intestine, and has much less
activity than the calcium-transporting ATPase. The possibility of vesicular calcium
transport has been discussed above.
</p>
<p>5.6 Other Factors Affecting Calcium Absorption
</p>
<p>In addition to vitamin D, a number of other dietary constituents have been suggested
to alter intestinal calcium absorption. Phosphate, oxalate, phytate, and fatty acids
can precipitate soluble calcium, and certain types of dietary fiber can bind calcium.
In some studies, lactose has been shown to increase calcium absorption, probably
by influencing the paracellular pathway. Overall, at intakes of the typical American
diet, these factors appear to influence calcium absorption only modestly. Bile salts
increase calcium absorption by similar mechanisms to those previously described
for iron absorption.
</p>
<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>A 40-year-old woman with long-standing Crohn&rsquo;s disease had a resection of
150 cm of terminal ileum. Two years later she develops recurrent disease and is
placed on the treatment of sulfasalazine. After 1-year treatment, she presents with
complaints of fatigue and numbness and tingling in her feet. She reports eating
a normal, unrestricted diet and does not take vitamin supplements. Laboratory
evaluation shows a megaloblastic anemia and reduced serum folate and vitamin B12
levels.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What is the pathogenesis of vitamin B12 deficiency in this patient, and what
treatment would you recommend?
</p>
<p>Answer: Vitamin B12 bound to intrinsic factor (IF) is absorbed via binding to
cubilin and then taken up by endocytosis in the ileum. This patient with a large
ileal resection would have vitamin B12 malabsorption. Large doses of oral
vitamin B12 may be absorbed in the proximal small intestine by passive diffusion
or other mechanisms and could be tried as replacement therapy; however,
intramuscular or intranasal vitamin B12 will correct the deficiency.
</p>
<p>2. What is the pathogenesis of this patient&rsquo;s folate deficiency?
Answer: The patient reports eating an unrestricted diet thus inadequate folate
intake is unlikely. Many Crohn&rsquo;s disease patients, however, avoid eating fruits
and vegetables, which are important dietary sources of folate. Folate is absorbed
mainly in the proximal intestine, which is likely to be functioning well in this
patient. She is, however, taking the medication sulfasalazine as treatment for
her Crohn&rsquo;s disease, and sulfasalazine is an inhibitor of folate conjugase</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>232 M.D. Sitrin
</p>
<p>(the enzyme that deconjugates polyglutamyl folates) and of monoglutamyl
folate uptake. It is likely that her folate deficiency is due to this drug-nutrient
interaction.
</p>
<p>3. What would be the results of a Schilling test in this patient?
Answer: The Schilling test would demonstrate reduced urinary excretion of
orally administered radioactive vitamin B12 given either alone or with IF.
</p>
<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>A 65-year-old man undergoes a total gastrectomy for a gastric adenocarcinoma.
After surgery, he is not given any vitamin or mineral supplements. Four years
later, he presents to his doctor with marked fatigue. He is found to be severely
anemic. The average size of his red blood cells is normal, but examination of a
blood smear shows that some cells are abnormally large, whereas others are very
small.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. Which nutritional deficiencies are likely to be causing this patient&rsquo;s anemia?
Answer: The patient is likely to be vitamin B12-deficient, since total gastrec-
tomy eliminates secretion of IF needed to bind vitamin B12 prior to receptor-
mediated ileal uptake. He is also likely to be iron-deficient, as gastric acid is
needed to solubilize dietary ferric iron and he has not received iron supplementa-
tion. Folate absorption could be somewhat impaired since folate is optimally
absorbed in the proximal intestine at a slightly acidic pH, and the lack of
gastric acid will cause the intraluminal pH to rise. Patients who have had total
gastrectomy, however, are not commonly folate-deficient, probably because
the lack of gastric acid permits the proliferation of ingested folate-producing
bacteria in the upper intestine and that folate is absorbed.
</p>
<p>2. How do you explain the findings regarding the size of his red blood cells?
Answer: Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency cause a macrocytic anemia,
whereas iron deficiency causes a microcytic anemia. In this patient with both
vitamin B12 and iron deficiency, the average red blood cell size may be normal,
but individual erythrocytes may be either macrocytic or microcytic.
</p>
<p>3. Why did this patient become vitamin B12-deficient in only 4 years?
Answer: The daily turnover rate of vitamin B12 is normally very low com-
pared with body stores. Vitamin B12 depletion will therefore not occur until
10&ndash;20 years of dietary lack. This patient, however, will have malabsorption
of both dietary vitamin B12 and vitamin B12 present in bile. The lack of
reabsorption and conservation of biliary vitamin B12 results in accelerated
depletion.
</p>
<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A 45-year-old woman has a 15-year history of primary biliary cirrhosis, a disease
characterized by progressive destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts and reduction
of bile flow. She presents with a fractured humerus after lifting a small bag of
groceries. She is found to have markedly reduced bone density. Laboratory testing</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>9 Absorption of Water-Soluble Vitamins and Minerals 233
</p>
<p>reveals reduced serum calcium, phosphorus, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels,
markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion, and 30 g/day of steatorrhea (normal,
less than 7 g/day). She is noted to eat few dairy products because they produce gas
and diarrhea.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What factors contribute to calcium malabsorption in this patient?
Answer: The most important cause of calcium malabsorption in this patient
is vitamin D deficiency, as vitamin D is necessary for efficient calcium
transport through the transcellular pathway (see Chap. 8 for a discussion
of vitamin D absorption). In addition, bile salts directly enhance intestinal
calcium absorption, and reduced bile flow in this patient would diminish the
intraluminal bile salt concentration. The patient has steatorrhea, and calcium
complexes with unabsorbed fatty acids, forming soaps that are excreted in the
stool.
</p>
<p>2. What nutritional therapy would you prescribe for her metabolic bone
disease?
</p>
<p>Answer 2: The patient should receive supplementation to correct her vitamin
D deficiency. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 is absorbed better than vitamin itself in
patients with severe cholestatic liver disease and may be the better form of
therapy (Chap. 8). She should be placed on a low fat diet to decrease her
steatorrhea and be given calcium supplementation in the form of low-lactose,
low-fat dairy foods or pharmaceutical preparations.
</p>
<p>3. How does her avoidance of dairy products contribute to her bone disease?
Answer 3: The patient has symptoms of lactose intolerance and avoids dairy
products (see Chap. 6 for a discussion of lactose absorption).Dairy foods are the
major dietary sources of both vitamin D and calcium. In addition, lactose may
enhance the efficiency of calcium absorption through the paracellular pathway.
</p>
<p>Case Study 4
</p>
<p>A 55-year-old man is found on routine testing to have abnormal liver function
tests (elevated serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase). His father died of
cirrhosis and congestive heart failure. Laboratory testing shows that his serum iron
is 300 mcg/dl, serum iron-binding capacity is 350 mcg/dl, and serum ferritin is
4,500 ng/ml.
</p>
<p>Questions
</p>
<p>1. What additional tests would you order?
Answer: The patient likely has hereditary hemochromatosis. Genetic testing can
be performed for certain mutations causing this disorder. The most common
mutation is in the HFE gene (mutation C282Y). The HFE protein is involved in
the regulation of hepcidin secretion from the liver by iron, which in turn controls
intestinal iron absorption. The patient should also have a liver biopsy to assess
the degree of liver damage from hepatic iron overload.</p>

</p>
<p>2. What other gene mutations could cause hemochromatosis?
Answer: Mutations in the genes coding for hepcidin, transferrin receptor 2,
ferroportin, and ferritin, all genes involved in the regulation of iron absorption,
can also cause hemochromatosis.
</p>
<p>3. What is the appropriate treatment for this patient?
Answer: The patient needs to be placed on a regular schedule of blood donation
until the body iron burden is reduced, assessed by a fall in the serum ferritin level
to 50&ndash;100 ng/ml.

<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The liver is a truly remarkable organ when one considers the diversity of its many
functions. This organ has a central role in nutrient (carbohydrate, protein and
lipid) and vitamin metabolism and serves as an intermediary between dietary
sources of energy and the extrahepatic tissues, which utilize such energy. Another
major function is the detoxification and elimination of xenobiotic toxins and drugs,
as well as endogenous metabolites, such as bilirubin. The liver is responsible
for the synthesis of biologically important proteins (i.e., albumin, transferrin,
clotting factors, complement factors, apolipoproteins, etc.). The liver synthesizes
and secretes the components of bile, including bile acids, which are important for
the intestinal solubilization and absorption of the products of lipid digestion. Finally,
the liver has an important role in immune function, due primarily to its resident
macrophage, the Kupffer cell.
</p>
<p>2 Liver Anatomy and Blood Supply
</p>
<p>In order to efficiently carry out its myriad functions, the liver has unique require-
ments with regard to anatomic location, blood supply, and structural organization.
The liver is the largest solid organ in the body, accounting for 3&ndash;5 % of body mass.
The liver is subdivided into twomain lobes (right and left) and two accessory lobes
(quadrate and caudate) (Fig. 10.1). These lobes are supplied with blood by the right
and left branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery, and bile is drained by the

<p>right and left hepatic bile ducts.Of more significance from a functional standpoint is
the segmental anatomy, whereby the liver is divided into eight segments, each with
distinct blood supplies and biliary drainage without collateral circulation between
segments (Fig. 10.2). The liver receives approximately 28 % of the body&rsquo;s total
blood flow and consumes 20 % of the total oxygen used by the body. The liver
is situated as a &ldquo;sentinel&rdquo; for the interception and processing of nutrients, toxins
and bile acids from the intestine because of its unique dual blood supply. The
liver receives all of the venous blood draining from the splanchnic vascular bed
by way of the portal vein (Fig. 10.3). Seventy-five percent of the incoming blood
volume to the liver is supplied from the portal vein. Normally, the portal system
is a low-pressure (5&ndash;10 mmHg) system designed to optimally deliver the venous
blood for flow through the hepatic sinusoids to allow the most efficient exposure</p>

<p>to the hepatocyte plasma membrane. The liver receives oxygenated arterial blood
from the hepatic artery. A portion of the blood from the terminal branches of the
hepatic arterial system flows through plexuses surrounding the interlobular bile
ducts before entering the sinusoids. Individuals who have received liver transplants
may survive with normal liver function after complete thrombosis of the hepatic
artery because oxygen delivered by the portal venous blood is adequate. However,
the dependence of the bile ducts on hepatic arterial blood is underscored by the
fact that these individuals often experience degeneration and loss of bile ducts after
arterial thrombosis.
</p>
<p>2.1 Microanatomy of the Liver
</p>
<p>The liver comprises several cells types in addition to hepatocytes. The hepatocytes
make up approximately 80 % of the volume of the liver and approximately
60 % of the total hepatic cell population. Mesenchymal cells, including Kupffer
cells, stellate (fat-storing or Ito) cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells, comprise
30&ndash;35 % of the total population, and bile ductular epithelial cells contribute
3&ndash;5 %. Liver cells are arranged in a polarized fashion on a basement membrane
in the liver lobule forming cords of cells (Fig. 10.4). As shown in Fig. 10.5,
hepatocytes are complex cells containing the necessary subcellular machinery to
function in synthesis, processing and secretion, as well as degradation and oxidation</p>

</p>
<p>of a variety of substrates. This is reflected by the presence of highly developed
endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, Golgi complex
</p>
<p>and cytoskeleton. Hepatocytes have a specialized cell membrane domain called the
canaliculus (Fig. 10.5), which functions in the secretion of bile constituents from
the hepatocyte. Newly formed bile coalesces in bile ductules (&lt;20 �m diameter),
which empty into progressively larger biliary channels to finally empty into the
common bile duct.
</p>
<p>Other non-hepatocyte (non-parenchymal) cells in the liver include stellate
(fat-storing or Ito) cells, Kupffer cells, pit cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells.
Stellate cells are located in the perisinusoidal space, usually in intimate contact
with endothelial cells via cytoplasmic processes and are concentrated in periportal
areas. As will subsequently be discussed, these cells function in the storage of
vitamin A. Stellate cells also produce extracellular matrix components, as well
as matrix degradative enzymes, and appear to play a role in the remodeling and
maintenance of the extracellular matrix. However, when stimulated by cytokines
and other factors, these cells are also responsible for hepatic fibrosis leading to
cirrhosis. Stellate cells also are capable of Ca2C-dependent contractility and may
function in regulation of sinusoidal blood flow.Kupffer cells are the liver&rsquo;s resident
macrophages and are located within the sinusoidal lumen. These cells phagocytize
dead cells, as well as debris and microorganisms brought in by the portal blood
from the intestine. When activated by substances such as bacterial endotoxin,
Kupffer cells secrete cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-˛, interleukin-1, and
interleukin-6, which can modulate several hepatocyte functions, including synthesis
of acute phase reactants (fibrinogen, &rsquo;-1-antitrypsin, and serum amyloid A),
albumin, and apolipoproteins, as well as lipid metabolism. These soluble factors
also affect the metabolism of sinusoidal endothelial cells. Pit cells are intrasi-
nusoidal lymphocytes with natural killer (NK) cell activity and play a role in</p>

<p>surveillance for viral infection and malignancy. Sinusoidal endothelial cells line
the hepatic sinusoids and are fenestrated to allow macromolecular permeation
(Fig. 10.6). These cells can respond to humoral factors to change the size of
these fenestrations to regulate permeability. These endothelial cells also are very
metabolically active and have numerous other functions, including active trans-
port, participation in coagulation, fibrinolysis, and immune responses. Sinusoidal
endothelial cells secrete nitric oxide (NO) (vasodilation) and endothelin (vaso-
constriction) and function in tandem with the stellate cell to regulate sinusoidal
vascular tone and pressure.
</p>
<p>The liver lobule is a histologic and functional unit of the liver (Fig. 10.4). A
typical lobule is hexagonal in cross section with interlobular portal triads (each
containing branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct) at the angles
of the hexagon. In the center of the lobule is the central vein or terminal hepatic
venule. Hepatocytes are arranged as single cell plates radiating from the central vein
to the portal triads in the periphery of the lobule. These plates are located between</p>

<p>the endothelial-lined sinusoids, which serve as vascular channels to carry blood
from the vessels in the portal triad at the periphery of the lobule to the central vein
in the center of the lobule. As discussed previously, the endothelial cells lining the
sinusoids are fenestrated and highly permeable to macromolecules. This allows
optimal exposure of hepatocyte plasma membranes to the mixed arterial-portal
venous blood, as well as allowing the unimpededmovement of larger particles, such
as lipoproteins, to and from the hepatocytes.
</p>
<p>Another conceptual unit of liver microanatomy defined by Rappaport is the
hepatic acinus (Fig. 10.7). In this structural model the portal triad is at the center
of the acinus, and the terminal hepatic venules are at the periphery. Cells are
grouped into zones based upon their distance from the blood vessels in the center of
the acinus (hepatic artery and portal vein branches). The closest, zone 1 cells, are
the first to receive oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood and to undergo regeneration, and
are the last to develop hypoxic injury. The opposite is true of zone 3 cells. Zone 2
cells are intermediate.
</p>
<p>There is an anastomosing network of hepatocyte canaliculi in the hepatic lobule,
which coalesces to drain bile into the interlobular bile duct in the portal triad through
the canal of Hering (Fig. 10.8). Bile flows into larger intrahepatic ducts and finally
into the right and left hepatic ducts, which exit the liver, merge in the porta hepatis,
and form the common hepatic duct. This duct is joined by the cystic duct from the
gallbladder to form the common bile duct, which empties into the duodenum.
</p>
<p>An important structural-functional concept in the liver is that of hepatocyte
heterogeneity and metabolic zonation (Fig. 10.9). For example, zone 1 hepato-
cytes are most active in glucose synthesis and release, oxidative energymetabolism,
amino acid utilization, and bile acid and bilirubin excretion. Zone 3 hepatocytes</p>

<p>Fig. 10.7 Hepatic acinus. This three-dimensional structure is the microvascular unit of the liver
parenchyma. The acinar axis is formed by the terminal hepatic venules (TPV), the hepatic arteriole
(HA), and the bile ductule (BD). The perfusion of this unit is unidirectional from the acinar axis
to the acinar periphery, where two or more terminal hepatic venules (THV) empty the acinus. The
arbitrary division of the acinus into functional zones is represented by 1, 2 and 3 (Reproduced with

<p>Fig. 10.9 Metabolic zonation of the liver and direction of liver perfusion. The predominant
zonal location of some metabolic pathways depends on the direction of liver perfusion. This
has been demonstrated for gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and ketogenesis. Monooxygenation and
glucuronidation were not affected by the direction of perfusion. TPV terminal portal venule, THV
terminal hepatic venule (Reproduced with permission from Gumucio and Chianale [8])
</p>
<p>are most active in glucose uptake and utilization, biotransformation, and ammonia
detoxification. Although lobular blood flow patterns may be responsible for at least
part of this zonation, in experiments in which flow patterns in rat liver were reversed,
some, but not all, of these zonal metabolic patterns were reversed. For example,
gluconeogenesis shifted from zone 1 to zone 3, and glycolysis and ketogenesis
shifted from zone 3 to zone 1. However, glucuronidation and monooxygenation
remained localized to zone 3.

<p>3 Evaluation of Liver Function
</p>
<p>Clinicians routinely rely on the performance of a battery of &ldquo;liver function tests&rdquo;
to assess the degree of liver injury and functional impairment in various disease
states. However, many of these tests really do not measure function at all, but rather
indirectly reflect degree of hepatocellular or bile ductular injury. It is also important
to be aware of all of the non-hepatic factors, as well as inherent limitations of the
tests themselves, which may affect the reliability of these tests. Table 10.1 lists many
of these tests and their uses. One test, the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
level, has such poor specificity for liver disease that it is not included.</p>

</p>
<p>3.1 Measures of Cellular Injury
</p>
<p>One of the most common groups of tests is the serum aminotransaminases,
alanine aminotransferase (ALT; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase or SGPT)
and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; serum glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase
or SGOT). These enzymes catalyze the reversible transfer of the alpha amino group
of the amino acids alanine and aspartic acid, respectively, to the &rsquo;-keto group
of &rsquo;-ketoglutaric acid. These enzymes are released into the circulation whenever
there is hepatocyte plasma membrane damage or necrosis. Whereas ALT is localized
exclusively in the cytosol, 20 % of AST is in the cytosol and 80 % is found in the
mitochondria. It is also important to note that AST is present in a variety of tissues
other than liver, including heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, red blood cells</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>248 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>and brain. However, ALT is relatively specific for liver. Although serum levels of
ALT and AST are elevated to some degree in almost all liver diseases, the highest
levels are seen with acute hepatocellular injury, such as viral hepatitis, toxin-
induced hepatic necrosis, and hypoxic liver injury. The decline in serum levels
after such an insult, particularly viral hepatitis, may not necessarily reflect recovery,
but may indicate massive necrosis with loss of viable hepatocyte mass available to
release transaminases. The same is true in the &ldquo;burned out&rdquo; cirrhotic patient with
chronic liver disease who also has little remaining viable liver cell mass. In the
majority of other liver diseases, including cholestatic and chronic liver diseases
and hepatic malignancy, serum transaminase levels are only slightly to moderately
elevated. A ratio of serum AST to ALT of more than 2 is suggestive of alcoholic
liver disease, if the ALT level is normal or only minimally elevated and the AST
level is only modestly elevated. This observation may be due to relatively selective
mitochondrial injury in alcoholic liver disease. If the AST is elevated significantly
out of proportion to a minimally elevated ALT, one should look for extrahepatic
reasons for the elevation, such as hemolysis, myocardial infarction or myopathy.
Concomitant elevation of LDH may suggest hemolysis, and elevation of creatine
phosphokinase (CPK) and aldolase would suggest muscle disease. Both ALT and
AST levels may be low in pyridoxine deficiency. Serum AST levels are depressed
in patients on long-term hemodialysis.
</p>
<p>3.2 Measures of Cholestasis
</p>
<p>Another group of tests is considered useful in the evaluation of cholestasis (bile
excretory failure). Alkaline phosphatase is actually a broad family of enzymes
found in a variety of tissues, including liver, bone, intestine, placenta, kidney and
leukocytes, which hydrolyze organic phosphate esters. In the liver, the enzyme is
associated with both sinusoidal and canalicular membranes, as well as the cytosol.
Normally, liver and bone isozymes are found in the circulation. Normal serum levels
are highly dependent on age, with high levels in childhood and puberty (due to
active bone growth), a plateau in middle age, and another increase in old age. The
various isozymes in serum can be biochemically fractionated to determine their
source. Themost striking elevations of alkaline phosphatase are seen in cholestatic
liver disease, particularly extrahepatic biliary obstruction, and hepatic carcinoma.
With regard to the mechanism of elevation in cholestasis, certain bile acids may
induce synthesis of alkaline phosphatase at the translational level. Obviously,
many types of bone disease, including biliary rickets seen in patients with chronic
cholestasis who are vitamin D deficient, may elevate the bone component of the
serum alkaline phosphatase level. The placental isozyme may account for serum
elevation during pregnancy. Serum alkaline phosphatase may be spuriously low in
the face of zinc deficiency.
</p>
<p>Another enzyme used to evaluate cholestasis, &rdquo;-glutamyl transpeptidase
(GGTP), is present throughout the liver and biliary tract, as well as other organs,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 Structure, Functional Assessment, and Blood Flow of the Liver 249
</p>
<p>including small intestine, kidney, testes, pancreas, spleen, heart and brain. This
enzyme catalyzes the transfer of &rdquo;-glutamyl groups from glutathione and other
peptides to other amino acids. The serum level of GGTP is a sensitive, though not
specific, test for detecting biliary tract disease and generally correlates well with
alkaline phosphatase levels. GGTP is inducible by drugs such as ethanol, phenytoin,
phenobarbital, and warfarin. In addition, levels may be elevated in a number
of conditions, including diabetes, chronic ethanol consumption, myocardial
infarction, renal failure, pancreatic disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. Another enzyme, 50-nucleotidase, is found in liver, intestine, brain, heart,
and pancreas. In liver it is primarily associated with canalicular and sinusoidal
membranes, and elevation of the serum level is more specific for liver disease than
either alkaline phosphatase or GGTP. However, this assay is often not available on
a timely basis in many hospitals.
</p>
<p>Although hepatic metabolism of bilirubin and bile acids will be discussed
subsequently in detail, they are discussed here in the context of their diagnostic
usefulness. Serum conjugated bilirubin levels are elevated in a number of
disease states, including hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and obstructive and
hepatocellular cholestasis. Although conjugated bilirubin elevation in cholesta-
sis is to be expected in the face of biliary excretory failure, its elevation in
hepatocellular injury is due to the fact that, except in cases such as massive
hepatocellular necrosis, hepatic bilirubin conjugating activity is relatively pre-
served in the face of hepatocellular injury and impaired excretion with release
of the conjugated bilirubin into the plasma compartment. Unlike unconjugated
bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin is readily filtered by the kidney and excreted in
the urine. Urobilinogen is formed by the action of intestinal bacteria on con-
jugated bilirubin. Up to 20 % of urobilinogen is absorbed and undergoes an
enterohepatic circulation, and a small fraction is excreted in the urine. With
liver dysfunction, a smaller fraction of absorbed urobilinogen is cleared by the
liver and an increased amount is excreted in the urine. In the case of biliary
obstruction,with decreased entry of bilirubin into the intestine, urinary urobilinogen
levels fall.
</p>
<p>Measurement of bile acids in serum can be a useful marker for cholestasis,
which is more specific and sensitive than the bilirubin level. In fact, elevation of
serum bile acid levels is implicit in the diagnosis of cholestasis. Measurements
may include total bile acids or specific ones such as cholylglycine. Unfortunately,
bile acid measurement does not reliably differentiate hepatocellular and obstructive
cholestasis. Fasting and post-prandial bile acid levels may be used to evaluate the
integrity of the enterohepatic circulation, because a slight elevation is expected after
a meal despite efficient first-pass clearance by the liver under normal conditions.
The post-prandial rise is even more pronounced in the face of mild liver disease,
with sub-optimal first-pass clearance. However, it has not been confirmed that post-
prandial measurements are more sensitive than those obtained with fasting for the
diagnosis of liver disease. Analysis of bile acid metabolites in urine is used to
diagnose inherited defects of bile acid metabolism, which may cause severe liver
disease in the neonatal period.</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>250 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>3.3 Measures of Liver Synthetic Function
</p>
<p>Measurement of serum proteins produced by the liver can provide an index of
liver synthetic function. The liver synthesizes six coagulation factors, including
factors I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V, VII, IX, and X. Although these factors
may be measured individually, the prothrombin time determination can indirectly
assess these factors. This assay evaluates the extrinsic coagulation pathway and is
prolongedwhen factors I, II, V, VII, and X are deficient, singly or in combination. In
addition to liver synthetic failure, other causes for prolongation of the prothrombin
time include congenital coagulation factor deficiency, consumptive coagulopathy
with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), drugs such as warfarin, and
vitamin K deficiency (factors II, VII, IX, and X). In fact, one should always check
for correction of the prothrombin time by parenterally administered vitamin K.
Correction is rapid, usually within 24 h. In the case of liver disease, there is generally
a large reserve for coagulation factor synthesis, such that prolongation occurs only
when a large portion of the liver&rsquo;s synthetic functional reserve is impaired, usually
in the setting of acute hepatocellular necrosis or chronic liver disease with cirrhosis.
</p>
<p>Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein synthesized by the liver, and
the serum level can serve as an index of liver synthetic function. The half-
life of serum albumin is 20 days, which limits its usefulness as a synthetic
marker for acute liver disease. In order to use the serum albumin level as an
indicator of liver synthetic function, one must be aware of the factors regulating
serum levels, including synthesis, distribution, and catabolism. Factors regulating
albumin synthesis include nutrition, plasma oncotic pressure, and liver dysfunction.
Nutrition is an extremely important regulator, particularly the availability of amino
acids, especially tryptophan. Abnormal loss of serum albumin through protein-
losing enteropathy or nephrotic syndrome should always be considered. In fact,
some degree of protein-losing enteropathy may accompany portal hypertension. In
the cirrhotic patient with edema and ascites, the volume of distribution for albumin
may be expanded, leading to reduced serum concentrations.
</p>
<p>3.4 Quantitative Liver Function Tests
</p>
<p>Several so-called &ldquo;quantitative&rdquo; liver function tests have been developed over the
years that generally rely on the plasma clearance of various substances by the
liver. Bromosulfophthalein (BSP) is an organic ion that was extensively used in
the past. However, it is presently not available in the United States for intravenous
injection. Indocyanine green is an inert dye that is exclusively eliminated by the
liver, unchanged, into bile. Administered intravenously in low doses, it is a good
indicator of liver blood flow. In higher doses, clearance is more dependent on
processing of the dye by the liver. This test is particularly sensitive for detecting
cirrhosis. The galactose elimination test is reflective of functional liver cell
mass. It is particularly useful in following individual patients with progressive liver</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 Structure, Functional Assessment, and Blood Flow of the Liver 251
</p>
<p>disease and declining hepatic function. Another quantitative test is the aminopyrine
breath test. After hepatic uptake, this compound is demethylated by cytochrome
P450. The labeled methyl group is eventually excreted in expired air as CO2.
Measurement of the labeled CO2 provides an index of hepatic excretion. Non-
radioactive 13C has replaced the formerly used radioactive tracer. This test has utility
for the detection of cirrhosis, as well as a prognostic indicator for the survival of
patients with cirrhosis. Another quantitative test is the lidocaine clearance test.
This test is performed by injecting a standardized dose of lidocaine intravenously
and measuring the appearance of its main metabolite, monoethylglycinexylidide
(MEGX) in serum. MEGX is formed in the hepatocyte by cytochrome P450-
dependent demethylation. Clinical studies indicate that the MEGX test may be
useful in evaluating liver dysfunction, particularly in the area of liver transplantation,
as an indicator for the need for transplantation, evaluation of graft function,
and determination of outcome after transplantation. Currently, all of these tests
are expensive, difficult to perform and not readily available in most hospitals for
routine use.
</p>
<p>3.5 Imaging Studies
</p>
<p>Several imaging studies are used for the evaluation of liver disease. Plain films
of the liver rarely provide useful information, except in the occasional case with
an intrahepatic calcification or calcified gallstones. Ultrasonography can provide
detailed anatomic data, as well as evaluate blood flow using a Doppler probe.
Ultrasonography can detect gallstones, bile duct dilatation, abscesses and masses,
such as tumors, down to 1&ndash;2 cm in size, and diagnose portal vein and hepatic vein
(Budd-Chiari syndrome) thrombosis/obstruction. Ultrasonography is less reliable
for evaluation of diffuse parenchymal lesions, such as cirrhosis and fatty liver.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) uses an intravenous microbubble contrast
agent. This imaging modality is most useful in evaluating focal lesions, including
hemangiomas and focal nodular hyperplasia. However, CEUS currently has limited
availability.
</p>
<p>Greater resolution is possible with computed tomography (CT) scanning,
which can be performed with and without intravenous and intestinal contrast
administration. CT scanning is particularly useful in detection of abscesses and
masses such as tumors.Angiography has largely been supplanted by newer imaging
methods, but still may be useful for studying the hepatic vessels and blood supply,
particularly in identifying the blood supply to tumors and evaluating the patient with
portal hypertension.
</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is gaining widespread use for liver
imaging. It is especially useful for detecting focal hepatic lesions, particularly in
distinguishing hemangiomas from other lesions, and detecting excessive hepatic
iron deposition in hemochromatosis. Imaging by MRI is also the most accurate
method for assessing hepatic steatosis, as occurs in non-alcoholic fatty liver</p>

<p>disease (NAFLD) associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Intraluminal
injection of contrast into the biliary tree, either percutaneously (percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography) or endoscopically directly through the ampulla of
Vater (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or ERCP) is useful for
evaluating the source of biliary tract obstruction. Biliary imaging by MRI
(magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or MRCP) is useful for the
diagnosis of biliary tract disease, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),
and is especially useful in children, because it carries less risk than ERCP and
avoids radiation exposure. An MRCP image of the bile duct lesions in PSC is
shown in Fig. 10.10. Intravenous cholangiography is rarely used because of its
relatively poor imaging.Radionuclide imaging of the liver is useful in the detection
of filling defects and diffuse hepatocellular disease. Hepatobiliary scans utilizing
radionuclides, such as 99mTc-DISIDA, taken up by the liver and excreted into
bile, are used to evaluate biliary excretory function. When used in conjunction
with ultrasonography, these scans can often reliably differentiate intrahepatic from
extrahepatic biliary obstruction.
</p>
<p>3.6 Elastography
</p>
<p>A promising technology for the non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis is transient
elastography. This technique can be performed with either ultrasonography or
magnetic resonance and is based on the observation that the propagation of a
waveform through a homogeneous tissue, such as liver, is proportional to its
stiffness, which in the case of liver is most often due to fibrosis or cirrhosis.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 Structure, Functional Assessment, and Blood Flow of the Liver 253
</p>
<p>Increased stiffness causes the wave to propagate more quickly, which can be
measured. Invalid measurements may result from improper positioning of the
transducer over rib or lung or in obese patients. Elastography is a rapidly evolving
technology, and its routine clinical utility remains to be proven.
</p>
<p>3.7 Liver Biopsy
</p>
<p>Examination of liver histology obtained by liver biopsy usually provides useful
information for both diagnosis and prognosis. In addition to providing sections
for light microscopy, tissue may be sent for special studies such as electron
microscopy for the diagnosis of mitochondrial or peroxisomal disorders, immunos-
taining for antigens such as hepatitis B or &rsquo;-1-antitrypsin, measurement of iron or
copper content for diagnosis of hemochromatosis or Wilson disease, respectively,
and specific enzyme assays for the diagnosis of metabolic disorders such as glyco-
gen storage disease. Percutaneous needle biopsy is generally safe and provides
adequate tissue. However, other approaches include the transjugular route when
coagulopathy is present, laparoscopic biopsy to allow direct visualization of the
liver, and open surgical wedge biopsy.
</p>
<p>3.8 Other Testing
</p>
<p>Additional disease-specific tests include detection of viral infections, such as
hepatitis A, B or C and other hepatotropic viruses by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and serology. Detection of specific autoantibodies is useful in the diag-
nosis of autoimmune liver diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis and primary
sclerosing cholangitis. Genetic testing is widely available for inherited diseases
such as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, and tyrosinemia. Tumor
markers, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9),
are helpful in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma,
but are not specific for liver cancer.
</p>
<p>A new class of biomarkers for liver disease undergoing intense scrutiny is
microribonucleic acid (miRNA). MicroRNAs are small (19&ndash;25 nucleotide) non-
coding single-stranded RNA molecules that regulate protein-coding genes and are
involved in modulation of many cell functions, both normal and aberrant. They
also function in complex gene regulatory networks. Their clinical utility resides
in their usefulness as biomarkers for disease and as potential therapeutic targets.
They may be measured in serum where they are protected from degradation by
RNases. Specific patterns of changes in serum levels of miRNA species are observed
in a variety of liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, malignancy, biliary atresia
(a serious liver disease in infants) and in liver graft rejection after transplantation.</p>

<p>4 Hepatic Blood Flow, Cirrhosis, and Portal Hypertension
</p>
<p>Under normal conditions, an important feature of hepatic blood flow is a very
low outflow resistance from the sinusoids. The sinusoidal pressure is generally
constant despite changes in blood flow. Maintenance of a low sinusoidal pressure
prevents an imbalance of Starling forces, which would result in excessive movement
of fluid, solutes and proteins through the highly permeable sinusoidal endothelial
lining into the space of Disse. Another feature of the hepatic circulation is the
regulation of hepatic arterial blood flow in response to changes in portal venous
</p>
<p>blood flow and sinusoidal pressure. This results in a reflex increase in hepatic
arterial blood flow in the face of a decrease in portal venous flow or sinusoidal
pressure, and a decrease in hepatic arterial flow in the face of an increase in
sinusoidal pressure. Hepatic arterial vascular resistance is responsive to intrinsic,
hormonal, and neural factors, all of which may play a regulatory role.
</p>
<p>The hepatic circulation is also very sensitive to changes in systemic pCO2
levels, much more so than to changes in pO2 levels. In animal models, higher
systemic pCO2 levels result in increased hepatic arterial and portal venous flow due
to decreased arterial resistance. Portal blood acidosis increases portal resistance
and decreases arterial resistance in the liver, and portal alkalosis has the opposite
effects. During digestion there is an increased oxygen extraction by the intestine
with an accompanying increase in portal venous pCO2 and decrease in pH. These
changes would be expected to increase hepatic arterial blood flow during a period of
enhanced hepatic metabolic activity. Increased portal flow also occurs after a meal
secondary to the accompanying splanchnic hyperemic response.
</p>
<p>The normal portal venous pressure is 5&ndash;10 mmHg. Because the direct measure-
ment of portal venous pressure in vivo is not generally practical, a wedged hepatic
venous pressure is often used as an indirect measurement. Portal hypertension is
defined as a wedged hepatic venous pressure that is more than 5 mmHg greater
than the pressure in the inferior vena cava. Portal hypertension is also present
when the splenic pulp pressure is greater than 15 mmHg, or the pressure in the
portal vein directly measured in surgery is greater than 30 cm H2O. Doppler
ultrasonography allows non-invasive measurement of portal venous flow. Portal
hypertension results from either an increase in portal blood flow or any process
that increases the resistance to portal blood flow at the level of the portal vein,
liver, hepatic veins, or heart. Therefore, portal hypertension may result from
increased portal blood flow (arteriovenous fistula), pre-hepatic obstruction (portal
vein thrombosis or compression by tumor), increased vascular resistance at the
hepatic level (cirrhosis or congenital hepatic fibrosis), or post-hepatic venous
obstruction/congestion (Budd-Chiari syndrome or right heart failure). Different
types of portal hypertension may also be classified as pre-sinusoidal, sinusoidal,
or post-sinusoidal, based upon information obtained from measurement of wedged
hepatic venous pressure. However, technical limitations of this measurement and
the fact that the pattern may change over time with the same disease process
limit the usefulness of this system of classification. Table 10.2 lists causes of</p>

<p>portal hypertension. The following discussion will generally be limited to portal
hypertension resulting from hepatic cirrhosis.
</p>
<p>A number of insults to the liver, including hepatitis (viral or autoimmune),
toxins (alcohol, drugs, and environmental toxins), metabolic disease (Wilson
disease, &rsquo;-1-antitrypsin deficiency), and extrahepatic biliary obstruction (stones,
tumor) may result in hepatic fibrosis and marked alteration of the normal hepatic
microanatomy. Figure 10.11 shows a photomicrograph of a liver biopsy from a
patient with advanced cirrhosis. Normal lobular architecture is abolished. Present
are regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous bands. Although vessels are identi-
fied in the fibrous bands, no central veins are present in the nodules. These changes
result in inefficient perfusion of hepatocytes with intrahepatic shunting of blood and
increased resistance to blood flow through the liver, contributing to the development
of portal hypertension.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 Structure, Functional Assessment, and Blood Flow of the Liver 257
</p>
<p>The interplay of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and stellate cells is a
major determinant of the vascular changes that occur in the liver in cirrhosis and
associated portal hypertension. There are likely two components to the increase in
resistance to flow through the hepatic sinusoids. One is structural and related to the
deposition of collagen in the sinusoids, as well as distortion by cirrhotic nodules,
resulting in a largely irreversible increase in resistance to portal flow and increased
portal pressure. The stellate cell becomes activated in response to exposure to
inflammation and chemokines and is responsible for collagen and matrix molecule
deposition. The other component is dynamic and related to dysregulation of
vascular tone. Stellate cells and stellate cell-derivedmyofibroblasts also are capable
of Ca2C-dependent contractility around the sinusoids to regulate vascular tone.
These cells respond to endothelial cell secretion of NO mediating vasodilation
and endothelins and other molecules modulating vasoconstriction. In disease states
with stellate cell proliferation and activation, this balance is tipped in favor of
vasoconstriction, contributing to increased resistance to blood flow through the liver.
Future therapeutic targets may be induction ofNO production by endothelial nitric
oxide synthase (eNOS) and inhibition of endothelins in the liver.
</p>
<p>The increase in intrahepatic vascular resistance in portal hypertension is accom-
panied by increased splanchnic blood flow. In response to the rise in portal pressure
due to increased intrahepatic resistance, porto-systemic collateral blood vessels,
such as esophageal and gastric varices, develop in response to increased release
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other factors, and shunting
contributes to a fall in splanchnic resistance and development of a hyperdynamic
circulation. Another mechanism for the drop in splanchnic resistance is an increase
in NO production in this vascular bed, in contrast to the local decrease in NO in the
hepatic sinusoidal bed. The resultant increase in flow into the portal circulation in
the face of increased resistance in the liver results in further elevation of the portal
pressure.
</p>
<p>In the patient with cirrhosis, collateral circulatory pathways develop to
allow portosystemic shunting of blood. These collaterals may include prominent
dilated superficial abdominal veins, caput medusae (tortuous periumbilical veins),
recanalization of the umbilical vein remnant, and rectal varices, as shown in
Fig. 10.12. Of the greatest clinical significance is the formation of esophageal
varices, thin-walled superficial veins in the distal esophagus, which can result
in life-threatening hemorrhage (Fig. 10.13a). Varices and portal hypertensive
gastropathy may develop in the stomach, which are also often a source of bleeding.
The factors that predispose varices to bleed are not well known. Irritation from
gastroesophageal reflux, a popular theory in the past, is probably not a common
event. The initiation of hemorrhage is probably a complex event dependent on
factors such as wall tension (T), transmural pressure [intravariceal pressure
(P1) &ndash; esophageal lumen pressure (P2)], vessel radius (r), and wall thickness
(W) as related to each other by the following equation involving Laplace&rsquo;s law:

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 Structure, Functional Assessment, and Blood Flow of the Liver 259
</p>
<p>Varices probably burst open and bleed when the wall tension can no longer
contain the forces expanding the varices. Large varices with thin walls would be
expected to have a greater tendency to bleed, compared to smaller varices with
thinner walls at the same transmural pressure.
</p>
<p>Bleeding esophageal varices may be treated by endoscopic injection of a
sclerosing solution (sclerotherapy) or placement of bands around the varices
(banding, Fig. 10.13b). Acute reduction in portal hypertension is possible by
the intravenous infusion of vasopressin or octreotide (a somatostatin analogue),
which results in splanchnic arteriolar constriction and temporary reduction in
portal venous pressure. Chronic reduction of portal hypertension is possible
with administration ofˇ-adrenergic antagonists, particularly propranolol, although
not all patients are responsive. This therapy appears to work predominantly by
enhancing splanchnic arteriolar vasoconstriction by blocking &ldquo;1-receptor-mediated
vasodilatation. These therapeutic modalities have replaced balloon tamponade using
a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube. Another approach to treat the underlying portal
hypertension is surgical creation of a portosystemic shunt between the portal
system and systemic venous system to reduce portal blood pressure. The technique
of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) via interventional
radiology is widely used as an emergency procedure to reduce portal pressure to
avoid surgery and as a bridge to liver transplantation.
</p>
<p>Portal hypertension also results in splenic congestion and splenomegaly, often
causing functional hypersplenism. Hypersplenism results in sequestration of red
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets with resultant depression of counts of
one to all of these cell types in peripheral blood. Occasionally, the magnitude of this
reduction in circulating cell number is great enough to result in significant anemia
(red blood cells), risk for infection (leukocytes), or risk of bleeding (platelets).
</p>
<p>Chronic portosystemic shunting can also result in chronic intermittent
encephalopathy resulting from the entry of ammonia and other toxins, which would
normally be cleared by the liver, from the intestine into the systemic circulation via
collateral circulation and subsequently into the central nervous system. As might be
expected, surgical shunting to treat portal hypertension often leads to worsening of
encephalopathy.
</p>
<p>Another consequence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension is the development
of fluid in the peritoneal cavity (ascites) and peripheral edema, as well as
impaired renal function. The major factors contributing to these complications of
cirrhosis and portal hypertension are summarized in Fig. 10.14. A discussion of the
pathophysiology of these conditions provides an excellent insight into the important
role of the liver in the maintenance of normal circulatory homeostasis. The increased
lymph formation due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the splanchnic vascular
bed as a result of portal hypertension, as well as increased hepatic lymph formation
from locally increased vascular resistance, exceeds the capacity of the thoracic duct
to return the lymph to the systemic circulation. This event, along with venous
pooling in the splanchnic bed, results in a redistribution of the blood volume
and ascites formation. One of the major factors resulting in the development of
ascites is avid renal sodium retention in the patient with cirrhosis. A concept</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>260 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>Fig. 10.14 Schematic representation of the major pathophysiological mechanisms leading to renal
sodium retention and ascites in cirrhosis
</p>
<p>important to understanding this phenomenon is diminished effective blood volume.
Effective plasma volume refers to that fraction of the total circulating volume that
is effective in stimulating volume receptors.Decreased effective plasma volume is
the result of several factors. Hypoalbuminemia, which often is present in cirrhosis,
results in decreased plasma oncotic pressure and an imbalance in Starling forces
favoring an extravascular shift of fluid. Other factors include a decrease in systemic
vascular resistance caused by peripheral arteriovenous shunts, as well as circulating
vasodilators, such NO, carbon monoxide, and others. The net result of these
processes is a decreased effective plasma volume, despite the fact that the actual
plasma volume is increased. Lack of appropriate stimulation of volume receptors
sets in motion several compensatory mechanisms to correct what is inappropriately
perceived as a reduced vascular volume. These mechanisms include activation of
the renin-angiotensin system with resultant hyperaldosteronism and renal sodium
retention. Decreased aldosterone clearance by the cirrhotic liver also contributes to
the hyperaldosteronism. In addition, increased renin-angiotensin and sympathetic
nervous system activity leads to increased renal vascular resistance and a decreased
glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Other humoral factors may also contribute to
decreased renal blood flow and increased tubular reabsorption of sodium, including
renal prostaglandins, the kallikrein-kinin system, circulating natriuretic factor,
and atrial natriuretic factors.
</p>
<p>All of these factors in the patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension,
particularly those affecting renal blood flow, can result in renal failure, which is
termed the hepatorenal syndrome. This syndrome usually occurs in the setting
of end-stage liver disease and may be precipitated by overzealous diuresis or
paracentesis for ascites or variceal bleeding. It is characterized by the development
of oliguria with decreased GFR in the face of preservation of tubular function,
as reflected by a normal or increased fractional excretion of sodium and increased</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 Structure, Functional Assessment, and Blood Flow of the Liver 261
</p>
<p>water reabsorption. The most striking pathological event in the kidney is marked
vasoconstriction and diminution in arterial blood flow, particularly that supplying
the cortex. Kidneys from individuals with hepatorenal syndrome dying from liver
failure demonstrate a normal arterial tree on angiogram and have histologically
normal blood vessels when removed from the patient. Furthermore, these kidneys
function normally when transplanted into normal individuals with renal failure. This
suggests that the renal abnormalities in the hepatorenal syndrome are functional and
due to local and/or circulating factors.
</p>
<p>Complications of ascites in the patient with cirrhosis include spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis and impaired ventilation in extreme cases. Treatment of ascites
in the cirrhotic patient should be dictated by knowledge of the pathophysiology.
The cornerstone of treatment is sodium restriction. In fact, in many patients,
this one maneuver, if complied with, may result in a striking diuresis. Since
hyperaldosteronism is a prominent abnormality, treatment with the aldosterone
antagonist, spironolactone, is often effective and can be combined with a loop
diuretic if needed. However, one should be cautious, because aggressive diuresis
may precipitate hepatorenal syndrome or encephalopathy. Complete elimination
of ascitic fluid should never be the goal, but reducing it to make the patient
more comfortable and to eliminate any respiratory compromise should be the
objectives. Intravenous infusion of albumin in the patient with hypoalbuminemia
may facilitate a transient diuresis. Refractory cases may require paracentesis,
particularly in the face of respiratory compromise. The placement of shunts to drain
ascitic fluid back into the systemic circulation has been used, but is fraught with
complications, especially infection.
</p>
<p>5 Hepatic Sex Hormone Metabolism in Cirrhosis
</p>
<p>The role of the liver in sex hormone metabolism is underscored in the cirrhotic male
patient, particularly in those with alcoholic cirrhosis. Hypogonadism is frequently
present, with testicular atrophy and decreased libido. The testicular atrophy
reflects a decrease in seminiferous tubule mass, most likely the result of chronic
ethanol toxicity. Leydig cell dysfunction is also present and reflected by decreased
production of testosterone. Cirrhosis results in an increase in plasma levels of
sex hormone-binding globulin, and the combination of reduced total levels of
testosterone and increased protein binding results in significantly reduced levels of
free, biologically active hormone. Pre-menopausal women with alcoholic cirrhosis
have reduced levels of estradiol and progesterone and accompanying loss of
breast and pelvic fat and anovulation. Pathologic changes in the ovaries may be
at least partially due to ethanol toxicity, as is postulated in the testes in males. At
the hypothalamic-pituitary level, there is reduced basal gonadotropin secretion
and a reduced luteinizing hormone (LH) response to LH-releasing factor.Males
with cirrhosis frequently exhibit feminizationmanifested by gynecomastia, palmar</p>

</p>
<p>erythema, cutaneous spider angiomata, and a female escutcheon. Although the
mechanisms of this estrogenization are not completely known, hepatic clearance
of estrogens is reduced and may contribute to elevated circulating levels. Another
mechanism may involve the reabsorption of estrogens and androgens excreted
in bile with accompanying inefficient first-pass clearance by the liver in the face
of portosystemic shunting and hepatocellular dysfunction. This allows exposure of
estrogen-sensitive peripheral tissues to these estrogens. There also appears to be
increased peripheral conversion of reabsorbed androgens to estrogens. Finally,
there may be increased sensitivity of peripheral tissues to estrogens in these
individuals.
</p>
<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>A 55-year-old white male is brought to the emergency room by family members
with a history of passing three large, foul-smelling, black, tarry stools over the past
12 h. He has also been &ldquo;acting strangely&rdquo; over the past 2 days and has been verbally
abusive and very agitated, more so than usual when intoxicated. Family members
report that the patient has a history of &ldquo;drinking heavily&rdquo; for the past 25 years. He
often will consume a pint of whiskey per day. There has also been an inversion of
sleep patterns. Today, he has been very sleepy and difficult to arouse. They also
report that they have noticed a large increase in the size of his abdomen over the
past several weeks, and his pants no longer fit. There is no past history of blood
transfusion, intravenous drug use, or hepatotoxic drug exposure.
</p>
<p>Physical examination: Respirations 22, temperature 37.2 ıC rectally, pulse 96,
and blood pressure 122/81. When tilted up, the pulse rate goes up to 116, and the
blood pressure drops to 106/66. The patient is sleepy, but arousable with vigorous
stimulation. However, he is very combative and uncooperativewhen aroused. Pupils
are equal and reactive to light. The chest is clear to auscultation. There is bilateral
breast enlargement. Cardiac examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm and
a grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur. The abdomen is distended and exhibits
shifting dullness, indicating ascites. There are dilated superficial abdominal veins.
The liver edge cannot be palpated but has a span of 12 cm by percussion. The
spleen is palpable 8 cm below the left costal margin. There is reduced pubic hair
in a female distribution. Rectal examination reveals black stool strongly positive for
occult blood. Skin examination reveals several spider angiomata.

<p>10 Structure, Functional Assessment, and Blood Flow of the Liver 263
</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. What is the most likely source of bleeding (melena) in this patient?
Answer: With the history of long-term heavy ethanol abuse, bleeding
esophageal varices due to portal hypertension from alcoholic cirrhosis would
be a likely source. The physical findings discussed below would also support
this diagnosis. It should be remembered that ethanol itself is an irritant and can
produce gastritis with bleeding. Also, there is a higher than usual incidence of
peptic ulcer disease in individuals with cirrhosis.
</p>
<p>2. What is the cause of the altered mental state?
Answer: The history and present findings are certainly compatible with hepatic
encephalopathy, particularly the inversion of the sleep/wake cycle, somnolence,
and concomitant gastrointestinal bleeding, which often exacerbates hepatic
encephalopathy because of the increased intestinal ammonia load. However,
ethanol abuse alone can produce an organic brain syndrome. Electrolyte
derangements can cause altered mentation and should always be checked.
Wernicke-Korsakoff psychosis may develop in alcoholics in the setting of
thiamine deficiency. Also, abuse of other psychoactive drugs should be
considered, often on an unintentional basis because of confusion as to proper
dosing of prescribed medication. Remember that the patient must be conscious
and cooperative to allow elicitation of asterixis and that asterixis is not specific
for hepatic encephalopathy.
</p>
<p>3. What findings support a diagnosis of cirrhosis?
Answer: The suspicion of esophageal varices and the presence of dilated
superficial abdominal veins as evidence of portosystemic collaterals and the
presence of ascites and splenomegaly indicate portal hypertension. There are
signs of hyperestrogenism and hypogonadism (gynecomastia, spider angiomata,
and a female escutcheon). Palmar erythema may not be obvious in the face of
blood loss and hypovolemia. In the setting of heavy ethanol abuse, alcoholic
cirrhosis would be most likely. However, other considerations would include
chronic active viral (HBV or HCV) hepatitis with cirrhosis and primary
hemochromatosis. Much less likely would be etiologies such asWilson disease
or &rsquo;-1-antitrypsin deficiency. There is no history of drug or toxin exposure,
which might result in chronic liver disease and development of cirrhosis,
although the medical history in such a patient may not be reliable. The serum
GGTP elevation is most likely due to induction by chronic ethanol ingestion.
</p>
<p>4. How would you interpret the laboratory tests reflective of renal function in
this patient?
</p>
<p>Answer: The low serum sodiummay reflect a relative dilutional hyponatremia
in the face of total body sodium overload due to the renal sodium retention
present in cirrhosis. Hypokalemia is often present in the cirrhotic patient due
to respiratory and/or metabolic alkalosis driving potassium into cells and
chronic renal loss caused by hyperaldosteronism. These individuals are almost
always total body potassium-depleted. The presence of the hypokalemia may
further exacerbate the alkalosis and have adverse effects on renal and muscle
function. It is very difficult to interpret the BUN and creatinine as indices of</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>264 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>renal function in this patient. The BUN may be elevated because of reduced
vascular volume (pre-renal azotemia), increased urea production from blood
</p>
<p>in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or renal failure (acute tubular necrosis or
hepatorenal syndrome). The creatinine level may be high, reflecting renal
failure, or factitiously low in the face of a markedly reduced muscle mass in
the cirrhotic patient. Close monitoring of urine output during replenishment of
blood volume and evaluation of renal tubular function using indices such as the
fractional excretion of sodium and urine osmolality and examination of the urine
sediment may be useful.
</p>
<p>5. How should one proceed with the treatment of this patient?
Answer: Because the patient has significant hypovolemia, as demonstrated by
the positive &ldquo;tilt&rdquo; test, adequate venous access should be established (preferably
a central line) and blood should be sent for type and crossmatch immediately.
Volume expansion should be started immediately; 5 % albumin would be a good
choice. Also, vitamin K should be administered parenterally, and fresh frozen
plasma infusion would provide volume as well as correction of coagulopathy.
Active variceal bleeding may be treated with a vasopressin or octreotide infu-
sion followed by upper GI endoscopy with variceal banding. Encephalopathy
may be treated by removing the source of GI bleeding (esophageal varices)
and administering lactulose or a non-absorbable antibiotic, such as rifaximin,
by nasogastric tube.

<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>A 5-year-old female is brought to the emergency room with a history of vomiting
blood twice and passing three large, tarry, foul-smelling stools in the last 6 h. She
has remained alert and complained only of nausea. She has been healthy up to this
time with no complaints of abdominal pain or jaundice. She was born prematurely at
32 weeks gestation and spent 2 weeks in the neonatal ICU with respiratory distress
and sepsis. However, since then she has been healthy with no other significant
illness.
</p>
<p>Physical examination: Respirations 22, temperature 37.6 ıC rectally, pulse 112,
blood pressure 96/55, weight 18.2 kg (50th percentile), and height 108 cm (50th
percentile). This is an anxious, pale female child who is alert and cooperative.
There is no jaundice. Her physical examination is generally unremarkable without
stigmata of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis except for the abdominal examination,
which reveals an enlarged spleen palpable 4&ndash;5 cm below the left costal margin.
There is no hepatomegaly or ascites. Rectal examination yields guaiac-positive
stool. The neurologic examination is normal, and asterixis cannot be elicited.

</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. What is the most likely source of this girl&rsquo;s bleeding?
Answer: In a child with upper GI bleeding of this magnitude without sig-
nificant liver dysfunction and with a past history of neonatal intensive care
and splenomegaly, portal hypertension and bleeding esophageal varices
secondary to cavernous transformation of the portal vein would be very
likely. This form of post-hepatic portal hypertension often is a sequela of portal
vein thrombosis from placement of an umbilical vein catheter and/or omphalitis
in the neonatal period. The term &ldquo;cavernous transformation&rdquo; refers to the
characteristic appearance of this lesion on angiogram demonstrating collaterals
and recanalization in the region of the obstruction. This diagnosis can often be
made by ultrasonography with Doppler flow analysis. Although these patients
often have significant portal hypertension, they rarely have ascites, and they
are rarely encephalopathic because of their normal liver function. This finding
contrasts with hepatic (cirrhosis) or pre-hepatic (Budd-Chiari syndrome) portal
hypertension, which is frequently complicated by ascites and liver dysfunction.
Other causes of portal vein obstruction would include thrombosis due to a
disorder in blood coagulation such as anti-phospholipid syndrome or protein C
deficiency, extrinsic compression by tumor or other mass, or abdominal trauma.
The majority of cases in otherwise healthy children are idiopathic. Indeed, in this
patient esophageal varices were documented and sclerosed by endoscopy, and
cavernous transformation of the portal vein was diagnosed by ultrasonography.
Cavernous transformation of the portal vein demonstrated by venous phase
superior mesenteric arteriography in a child is shown in Fig. 10.15.
</p>
<p>2. Why does this patient have elevated blood ammonia?
Answer: This patient has modest hyperammonemia because of the increased
intestinal ammonia load from the variceal bleeding along with decreased
hepatic first-pass portal blood clearance secondary to the portal vein obstruc-
tion and collateral circulation. The preservation of normal hepatic function
prevents higher ammonia levels and clinical encephalopathy.
</p>
<p>3. What is the significance of the elevated BUN in this patient?
Answer: In the face of normal hepatic function and pre-existing normal renal
function, the BUN is most likely elevated secondary to increased BUN pro-
duction from GI bleeding and volume depletion leading to pre-renal azotemia.
Although variceal bleeding and hypovolemia can lead to acute tubular necrosis,
the normal creatinine level would not be consistent with renal failure. However,
during hospitalization urine output and renal function should be monitored
closely, particularly in the face of continued bleeding.</p>

</p>
<p>4. Why are the white blood cell count and platelet count depressed?
Answer: The presence of splenomegaly in an individual with portal hypertension
often leads to hypersplenism, with sequestration of red blood cells, leukocytes
and platelets. In this patient it is difficult to determine how much of the present
anemia was pre-existing from hypersplenism and how much is due to blood loss
from variceal bleeding.
</p>
<p>5. How would you treat this patient?
Answer: The samemeasures to manage variceal bleeding discussed for the previ-
ous case would be used. However, treatment of coagulopathy and encephalopathy
would not be necessary. These patients can often be managed by multiple
sessions of endoscopic banding to obliterate their varices until they reach
adolescence, when they will often have developed enough collateral circulation
to prevent recurrence of varices. Occasionally, a surgical portosystemic shunt
procedure is needed, but tends to be well tolerated without portosystemic
encephalopathy because of the presence of normal liver function. Rarely is
hypersplenism severe enough to be the sole indication for a surgical shunt
procedure.

<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A 19-year-old African-American male is referred to your clinic because of recent
worsening of recurrent right upper quadrant pain that started 3 months ago. He has
also noticed deepening yellowish discoloration of his sclerae. He relates that he
has hemoglobin SS disease (sickle cell disease) that was diagnosed in childhood.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>10 Structure, Functional Assessment, and Blood Flow of the Liver 267
</p>
<p>He has had recurrent painful crises throughout his life, and his present symptoms
were initially thought to represent a component of one of these crises. However, the
pain is now persistent, and the jaundice is unrelenting. He cannot relate the pain
to eating or a specific activity. His urine is now dark colored. He has had multiple
hospitalizations for his sickle cell disease, but no other serious illnesses. He has two
younger siblings with the same disease.
</p>
<p>Physical examination: Respirations 20, temperature 37.3 ıC rectally, pulse 72,
and blood pressure 122/81. The patient is clearly uncomfortable, but in no acute
distress. There is bilateral scleral icterus. The chest is clear to auscultation. Cardiac
examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm and a grade I/VI systolic ejection
murmur. The abdomen is soft and non-distended. There is mild right upper quadrant
tenderness. The liver edge cannot be palpated but has a span of 12 cm by
percussion. The spleen is not palpable. There is no abdominal mass or ascites.
Further examination reveals no spider angiomata or other stigmata of chronic liver
disease or cirrhosis.

</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. To what hepatic complications are patients with sickle cell disease
susceptible?
</p>
<p>Answer: These individuals were prone to hepatitis C infection in the era before
accurate testing was available for donated blood. They are also at increased risk
for autoimmune liver disease. They may also develop liver disease secondary
to sickled red blood cells lodging in hepatic sinusoids and producing ischemic
changes in the hepatocytes. This may range across a spectrum from acute
hepatic crisis with fever, right upper quadrant pain, tender hepatomegaly and
jaundice with mild transaminase elevation and total bilirubin levels usually less
than 13 mg/dL that is usually readily reversible, to a sequestration crisis with
massive sequestration of red blood cells in the liver and severe anemia, to sickle
cell intrahepatic cholestasis with severe liver impairment, often leading to liver
failure. Multiple blood transfusions may lead to iron overload and liver injury.
They are also at risk for thrombotic complications, such as hepatic vein throm-
bosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome. Finally, the increased production of bilirubin
due to enhanced turnover of the abnormal cells containing hemoglobin SS, as
reflected by the anemia and elevated reticulocyte count indicating increased red
cell production by the bone marrow, frequently leads to formation of pigment
gallstones. See the discussion of bilirubin metabolism in Chap. 12.
</p>
<p>2. What is the likely diagnosis in this patient?
Answer: The elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGTP suggest biliary obstruc-
tion. An ultrasound study is quickly obtained that shows multiple gallstones in</p>

<p>the gallbladder, as well as a single stone in the common bile duct with significant
dilatation of the duct proximal to the stone, indicating a high-grade obstruction.
</p>
<p>3. What is the recommended treatment?
Answer: After hydration and starting antibiotics to prevent bacterial cholangitis
due to the obstruction, the patient undergoes an ERCP, and the endoscopist
verifies the presence of a single stone in the common bile duct and is able
to retrieve the stone with a basket. A few days later with further stabilization
and improvement in the cholestasis, the patient undergoes a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy to prevent any future stone formation and episodes of stones
migrating from the gallbladder into the bile duct to cause obstruction.

<p>Protein Synthesis and Nutrient Metabolism
</p>
<p>Dennis D. Black
</p>
<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The liver produces and secretes most of the circulating proteins in the body that
function in an amazingly complex array of regulatory and metabolic processes.
The liver also functions as a central metabolic way station for the processing,
partitioning and trafficking of nutrients, including lipids and carbohydrates,
as well as vitamins, at the intersection of the intestine and the rest of the body.
It is remarkable that the regulatory mechanisms that have evolved to control
these processes generally function in a highly responsive and coordinated manner.
However, when dysregulation occurs due to genetic or environmental factors, such
as in glycogen storage diseases or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, significant
morbidity may result. This chapter will highlight these functions of the liver and
some of the disease processes that may occur.
</p>
<p>2 Role of the Liver in Synthesis of Biologically Important
</p>
<p>Proteins
</p>
<p>The majority of circulating plasma proteins is synthesized by the liver. A list
of plasma proteins secreted by the liver and their characteristics and functions
is shown in Table 11.1. To accomplish this task, the hepatocyte has a well-
developed endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi system, and cellular cytoskeleton, all
of which function in the synthesis, processing, and secretion of proteins. The
most abundant plasma protein produced by the liver is albumin, which comprises

<p>55&ndash;60 % of the total plasma protein pool. Albumin serves as a binding and carrier
protein for hormones, amino acids, steroids, vitamins, and fatty acids. It is also an
important osmotic regulator in the maintenance of normal plasma oncotic pressure.
Albumin synthesis is exquisitely sensitive to nutritional status and availability of
amino acids, particularly tryptophan. Also, it has been demonstrated that albumin
gene transcription is regulated by changes in serum colloid osmotic pressure
to facilitate maintenance of osmotic homeostasis. This regulation appears to be
mediated by the interaction of transcription factor HNF-1&rsquo; with a specific site in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11 Protein Synthesis and Nutrient Metabolism 273
</p>
<p>the albumin gene promoter region. Furthermore, it is interesting that expression
of other genes with promoters containing the HNF-1&rsquo; recognition site, such as
&rsquo;-1-antitrypsin and certain apolipoproteins, can be regulated by the serum colloid
osmotic pressure. This is but one example of the complex regulatory mechanisms
involved in hepatocyte gene expression. The other proteins synthesized and secreted
by the liver are for the most part glycosylated proteins (glycoproteins), which
function in hemostasis, protease inhibition, transport, and ligand binding.
</p>
<p>One especially interesting glycoprotein produced by the liver is important in both
health and disease.Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A-1-AT) is a neutrophil protease inhibitor
that is secreted and protects tissues, particularly lung, from damage by endogenous
proteases. In A-1-AT deficiency, a point mutation produces an abnormal protein
that accumulates in the ER and is susceptible to misfolding, polymerization and
aggregation, resulting in toxicity to the hepatocyte. This disorder is a common
cause of liver disease in infants and adults, as well as chronic lung disease in adults.
Interestingly, only about 10 % of homozygotes develop clinically significant liver
disease that may require liver transplantation. Genetic and environmental modifiers
that impact on the adaptation to or degradation of the accumulated abnormal protein
in the hepatocyte ER, through proteosomal and autophagic pathways, appear to play
crucial roles in determining the severity of the liver disease. Development of new
therapies has focused on targeting and enhancing these pathways.
</p>
<p>3 Role of the Liver in Carbohydrate Metabolism
</p>
<p>The liver plays a key role in the utilization of themajormonosaccharides, glucose,
fructose, and galactose (Fig. 11.1). The initial step in hepatic glucose metabolism
is phosphorylation by glucokinase. Glucokinase synthesis is increased by high
glucose diets and high insulin concentrations. Depending upon the metabolic need,
the glucose may be utilized for energy production, synthesis of other substrates
(i.e. amino acids, fatty acids), or stored as glycogen. Glycogen is a polymer of
units of glucose (Fig. 11.2) with linear 1-4 linkages and branch points with 1-6
linkages. Glycogen serves as a storage depot for glucose in the liver, which can be
readily mobilized when glucose is in immediate demand. Because of its polymeric
structure, glycogen has a low osmolality and is more easily stored in hepatocytes
than the monomeric glucose. The liver can store up to 65 g of glycogen per kilogram
of liver tissue.
</p>
<p>Fructose is taken up by the hepatocyte and phosphorylated by fuctokinase
(Fig. 11.1). It may then be stored as glycogen by conversion to glucose-6-
phosphate. When used for energy production, phosphorylated fructose may actu-
ally traverse the glycolytic pathway more readily than glucose. Also, fructose is
a better substrate for lipogenesis than glucose in the liver. Hepatic metabolism of
fructose follows theLeloir pathway to form either glucose-6-phosphate to enter the
glycolytic pathway or UDP-glucose to enter the glycogenesis pathway. Galactose
can also be taken up and used by the liver after phosphorylation by galactokinase
(Fig. 11.1).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>274 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>Fig. 11.1 Metabolic pathways for hepatic utilization of glucose, fructose, and galactose
</p>
<p>Glycolysis is the only pathway by which glucose can be oxidized anaerobically
with production of ATP. Under aerobic conditions the liver uses mainly fatty acids
as substrates for oxidation, and the glycolytic rate is low. Higher rates of glycolysis
result in lipogenesis from carbohydrate. Regulation of glycolysis in the liver is
highly integrated with that of gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, glycogen synthesis, and
glycogenolysis.
</p>
<p>Gluconeogenesis is the production of glucose from amino acids and lactate
and is carried out solely in liver and renal cortex. Two cycles exist for hepatic
gluconeogenesis from non-hepatic substrates (Fig. 11.3). These are the lactic acid
(Cori) cycle and the glucose-alanine cycle. In the Cori cycle lactic acid produced by
workingmuscle is taken up by the liver and provides a substrate for gluconeogenesis
to produce glucose. Alanine is also released from muscle and serves as a substrate
for hepatic glucose synthesis. Regulation of gluconeogenesis is dependent on
substrate availability and hormonal factors, particularly insulin and glucagon levels.
Overall, glucagon and epinephrine stimulate and insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis.
</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, glycogen is a storage form of glucose consisting of
a polymeric form of glucose. The pathway for glycogen metabolism is shown in
Fig. 11.4. Most substrates enter the glycogen synthetic pathway by conversion
to UDP-glucose. The glucosyl units are linked linearly by 1-4 linkages by the
enzyme UDPG-glycogen synthetase. Branch points with 1-6 linkages are formed
by the branching enzyme amylo-1-4, 1-6-transglucosidase. Glycogen synthesis is</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 11.2 Pathway for production of glucose from glycogen (glycogenolysis). Notice that the
product of the phosphorylase-catalyzed hydrolysis of glycogen is glucose-1-phosphate. A small
amount of glucose (about 6 % of the total produced) is released via action of the enzyme amylo-
1,6-glucosidase. This last reaction removes the glucose residues that form branch points (closed
circles) and occurs after the shortened oligosaccharide chain attached to a branch point (three
glucose residues) is shifted to create a longer oligosaccharide. These reactions are required because
phosphorylase will not catalyze hydrolysis of short oligosaccharide chains (Reproduced with
permission from Zakim [16, p. 69])
</p>
<p>promoted by insulin and glucocorticoids and by increased glucose concentrations.
Glycogen synthetase is the rate-limiting step in glycogen synthesis and is con-
verted from active to inactive form by phosphorylation by a cAMP-dependent
protein kinase. Glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen to release glucose
units, is promoted by glucagon, epinephrine, vasopressin, angiotensin II, and
oxytocin. Under conditions promoting glycogenolysis, phosphorylase catalyzes
glycogenolysis by breakage of the linear 1-4 linkages. Phosphorylase is converted
from the inactive to active form by phosphorylation by a cAMP-dependent protein
kinase. Glucose molecules are removed from the 1-6 linkage branch points by the
debrancher enzyme amylo-1-6-glucosidase (Fig. 11.2). Several inherited defects in
various steps of glycogen metabolism have been identified, as shown in Fig. 11.4,
and result in a clinical spectrum of glycogen storage diseases with the abnormal
accumulation of glycogen in the liver.</p>

muscle is taken up by the liver and provides a substrate for gluconeogenesis to produce glucose.
Alanine produced in muscle as a result of protein breakdown, is released and deaminated in the
liver to form pyruvate. Glucose is formed from pyruvate and is released to be metabolized by
muscle, where it is reconverted to pyruvate and alanine, respectively, completing the cycle. BCA

</p>
<p>4 Role of the Liver in Lipid Metabolism
</p>
<p>Fatty acids are synthesized in the liver from carbohydrate precursors by conversion
of these precursors to acetyl-CoA by the cytosolic fatty acid synthase complex.
Hepatic fatty acid synthesis is stimulated by carbohydrate feeding and insulin. Fatty
acids are generally stored in the liver as triglycerides, consisting of three fatty
acids esterified to a glycerol backbone. Fasting, starvation, and diabetes mellitus
with insulin deficiency cause increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation and production
of acetoacetate and D-3-hydroxybutyrate (also known as ketones), which can be
used as an energy source bymuscle and brain. This process is known as ketogenesis.
Lipolysis of adipose tissue triglycerides provides a major source of substrate fatty
acids to the liver for production of ketones. The plasma glucagon to insulin ratio
is probably the main regulator of ketogenesis.
</p>
<p>The liver is a major site of fatty acid &ldquo;-oxidation, which results in the
production of energy using fatty acids as substrates. There are two postulated
regulatory mechanisms for &ldquo;-oxidation when carbohydrate is in short supply:
regulation at the level of pyruvate formation and regulation at the level of fatty
acid entry into the mitochondria, the site of most fatty acid oxidation, by way of
carnitine acyltransferase I. Another site of fatty acid oxidation in the hepatocyte,
particularly for saturated long chain fatty acids, is the peroxisome. Peroxisomal
fatty acid oxidation is regulated only by fatty acid substrate concentration. This
pathway may provide a mechanism for the production of acetyl CoA outside
the mitochondria without the participation of citrate formed in the mitochondria.</p>

</p>
<p>Peroxisomal &ldquo;-oxidation is inducible in rats by feeding a high-fat diet and
treatment with certain hypolipidemic drugs that cause peroxisome proliferation.
</p>
<p>The liver is a major site of cholesterol synthesis from acetyl CoA. In fact,
all of the carbon atoms in cholesterol are derived from acetate. Cholesterol is
ubiquitous throughout the body as a structural component of cell membranes and is
a substrate for synthesis of several steroid hormones. Cholesterol is important in the
liver as the precursor for bile acid synthesis. The rate-limiting step in cholesterol
synthesis is the cleavage of CoA from the synthetic intermediate &ldquo;-hydroxy-&ldquo;-
methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA with the simultaneous reduction to mevalonate.
The enzyme which catalyzes this reaction is HMG-CoA reductase. Although the
regulation of hepatic cholesterol synthesis is complex, several regulatory factors</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>278 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>have been defined. In general, synthesis is up-regulated by any event that depletes
the hepatocyte of cholesterol. For example, depletion of the bile acid pool by
interruption of the enterohepatic circulation by biliary diversion, ileal resection
or administration of a bile acid sequestrant such as cholestyramine will increase
cholesterol synthesis, since bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol. Increased
secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) stimulated by an influx of
free fatty acids or carbohydrate requires cholesterol for packaging and depletes
intracellular cholesterol resulting in increased synthesis. Hormones such as thyroid
hormone, corticosteroids, and glucagon also up-regulate synthesis. Cholesterol
synthesis is down-regulated by events that increase cellular cholesterol, such
as the influx of cholesterol from receptor-mediated uptake of dietary cholesterol
in chylomicron remnants and endogenous cholesterol in low density lipoproteins
(LDL). The most potent down-regulators of cholesterol synthesis are oxidation
products of cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol. Bile acid
synthesis and biliary secretion of cholesterol are the major secretory pathways for
cholesterol and will be subsequently discussed.
</p>
<p>Triglycerides synthesized by the liver are secreted as particles called very low-
density lipoproteins (VLDL). Lipoproteins are spherical particles, which serve as
thermodynamically stable circulating packages for the transport of lipids through
the aqueous environment of the bloodstream. The core of the particle contains
hydrophobic, non-polar lipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and the surface
coating consists of hydrophilic, polar lipids, phospholipid and free cholesterol,
and lipid-binding peptides called apolipoproteins. Apolipoproteins generally serve
important functions in the assembly, secretion, and peripheral metabolism of
lipoprotein particles. The secreted hepatic VLDL serves to transport lipid from
the liver to peripheral tissues. In humans, a large portion of the VLDL secreted
is converted to low density lipoproteins (LDL), which are the major transporters
of cholesterol to various tissues throughout the body. This pathway is summarized
in Fig. 11.5.
</p>
<p>Carbohydrate feeding stimulates hepatic fatty acid production; thereby driving
increased triglyceride and VLDL production and secretion. Secreted VLDL triglyc-
eride is hydrolyzed by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase to liberate fatty acids for
storage by adipose tissue and energy production by muscle. Lipoprotein lipase
is bound to the endothelium of capillary beds in primarily adipose tissue and
muscle and requires the apolipoprotein apo C-II, produced by the liver, as a
cofactor. A related lipase produced by the liver, hepatic lipase, resides on sinusoidal
endothelial cells. Hepatic lipase is important in HDL metabolism and in the
hydrolysis of lipid in chylomicrons, VLDL and intermediate density lipoproteins
(IDL).
</p>
<p>The liver not only functions in the secretion of lipoprotein particles, but also is
an essential organ for the uptake and metabolism of lipoproteins. Chylomicrons
of intestinal origin, which carry mainly exogenous fatty acids and cholesterol,
are metabolized by lipoprotein lipase to produce triglyceride-depleted, relatively
cholesteryl ester-enriched remnants which are cleared by a receptor-mediatedmech-
anism in the liver. This receptor-mediated clearance involves the LDL receptor</p>

</p>
<p>Fig. 11.5 Simplified scheme of plasma lipoprotein metabolism. Key events are the hydrolysis of
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the conversion of VLDL to IDL, the
movement of surface lipids and apolipoproteins released during lipolysis by LPL to HDL, the
progressive enrichment of IDL and LDL with cholesteryl esters (CE) transferred from HDL as a
result of the LCAT reaction, and the removal of LDL and chylomicron remnants by peripheral cells
and the liver (Reproduced with permission from Glickman and Sabesin [7])
</p>
<p>and the LDL receptor-related protein, a membrane receptor, which binds and
internalizes a wide variety of ligands. A significant proportion of plasma LDL
particles are taken up by the liver via the LDL receptor, as the liver contains over
half of the body&rsquo;s total LDL receptors. Receptor-mediated LDL uptake results in an
increase in esterification of the incoming cholesterol for storage, down-regulation
of the number of LDL receptors, and suppression of cholesterol synthesis by the
cell (Fig. 11.6). Finally, it has been demonstrated that the liver takes up a portion of
VLDL particles shortly after they are secreted.
</p>
<p>Recently, another key protein that regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis in
the liver through interaction with the LDL receptor was identified, proprotein
convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Originally, PCSK9 was identified
as a protein up-regulated during apoptosis of nerve cells. Subsequently,mutations
of the PCSK9 gene associated with hypercholesterolemia were noted leading to
identification of its role in cholesterol metabolism. Gain-of-function mutations
result in increased plasma LDL cholesterol levels, and loss-of-function mutations
cause the opposite. The normal function of PCSK9 appears to be interaction with</p>

<p>the LDL receptor protein on the cell surface to interfere with normal recycling
of the protein and direct it to a degradative pathway. This role of PCSK9 in
cholesterol metabolism makes it an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment
of hypercholesterolemia.
</p>
<p>Another lipoprotein produced by the liver is high-density lipoprotein (HDL).
This particle is secreted as a discoidal bilayer consisting primarily of phospho-
lipid and free cholesterol. The major apolipoprotein is apo A-I, a cofactor for
lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is produced by the liver and
catalyzes the transfer of a fatty acid from lecithin to free cholesterol to produce
cholesteryl ester. These HDL particles acquire free cholesterol from peripheral
tissues, which is then esterified and thereby moves into the core of the particle to
change the shape from discoidal to spherical. This esterification is a driving force
to effect net movement of cholesterol from tissue membranes to HDL. A portion of
the cholesteryl ester in the HDL core may be transferred to a chylomicron, VLDL,
or LDL particle through the action of a plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein
(CETP) to allow transport of the cholesterol to a variety of tissues throughout the
body. The cholesterol from mature HDL particles is ultimately taken up by the liver
via scavenger receptor-BI (SR-BI). Thus, HDL function in &ldquo;reverse cholesterol
transport&rdquo; to effect cholesterol movement from peripheral tissues to the liver.
Serum levels of HDL cholesterol correlate inversely with risk for atherosclerotic
coronary artery disease.</p>

</p>
<p>4.1 Regulation of Hepatic Lipid Metabolism
</p>
<p>Many of the regulatory processes described above for hepatic lipid metabolism
are mediated by transcription factors called nuclear receptors that regulate the
transcription of key proteins and enzymes in response to physiological cues, such
as cellular lipid and substrate levels. One family of such receptors is that of the
sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). Key enzymes involved
in de novo lipogenesis, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and
stearoyl-CoA desaturase, are regulated by SREBP-1c, and genes involved in choles-
terol metabolism, including those of HMG-CoA synthase and reductase, the LDL
receptor and PCSK9, are regulated by SREBP-2. Another regulatory transcription
factor, carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), mediates
activation of several glycolytic and lipogenic regulatory enzymes, including fatty
acid synthase, acetyl CoA carboxylase and pyruvate kinase. It is translocated to
the nucleus and binds to the carbohydrate response element in the promoter of its
target genes. Activation of ChREBP occurs by dephosphorylation in the presence
of high levels of glucose-6-phosphate (glucose-responsive), leading to nuclear
translocation.
</p>
<p>The lipid-sensing property of SREBP-2 occurs via a unique cellular mecha-
nism called regulated intramembrane proteolysis. For example, in the case of
cholesterol, SREBP-2 precursor protein is anchored to the membrane of the ER and
complexed to the cholesterol sensing SREBP cleavage activating protein (Scap),
which in turn is bound to ER proteins, Insig-1 and -2. When cellular cholesterol
falls below a certain level, Scap and the Insigs no longer bind to each other. The
Scap/SREBP precursor protein complex then moves to the Golgi, where a site-1
protease (S1P), followed by a site-2 protease (S2P), cleave the SREBP precursor
protein to produce two N-terminal fragments that dimerize to form the active
transcription factor. The active SREBP then translocates to the nucleus and binds to
the promoter of a target gene, such as the LDL receptor, and activates transcription.
Subsequently, the increased number of LDL receptors takes up circulating LDL and
raise intracellular cholesterol levels, while lowering plasma cholesterol levels.
</p>
<p>Another class of nuclear receptor transcription factors, the liver X receptors
(LXRs), also play a major role in hepatic lipid metabolism, and exist in two
forms, LXR-&rsquo;, abundant in liver and other tissues, including intestine, and LXR-
&ldquo;, ubiquitous in many tissues. When activated by binding of a ligand, LXRs
heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and bind to specific response
elements, as well as coactivator and corepressor proteins, in the promoters of
their target genes to modulate cholesterol metabolism at several sites to avoid
cholesterol overload. Interestingly, LXR-&rsquo; has an LXR response element in its
gene promoter and can autoregulate its own transcription. The LXRs promote
transcription of genes that have wide-ranging effects on cholesterol homeostasis,
including efflux of cholesterol from peripheral cells, such as macrophages involved</p>

<p>in atherosclerosis viaATP binding cassette (ABC) proteins ABCA1 andABCG1.
They also regulate hepatic excretion of cholesterol into bile and intestinal absorption
of cholesterol by inducing ABCG5 and ABCG8. The endogenous ligands for
LXRs are oxysterols, formed by the oxidation of cholesterol and present in
proportion to the amount of intracellular cholesterol, thus enabling these receptors
to function as cholesterol sensors. The gene for the rate-limiting enzyme in bile
acid synthesis from cholesterol, Cyp7&rsquo;1, is also regulated by LXRs. Recently,
LXRs have been implicated in the regulation of target genes involved in glucose
metabolism and inflammation. Adverse effects of LXR activation, including hepatic
triglyceride overproduction via up-regulation of fatty acid synthesis, have hampered
the development of small molecule LXR agonists to prevent atherosclerosis and
treat other diseases. However, recent evidence suggests that exclusive targeting of
extrahepatic LXRs may bypass this problem.
</p>
<p>4.2 Hepatic Lipid and Lipoprotein Metabolism in Liver Disease
</p>
<p>In cholestatic liver disease, particularly biliary obstruction, hyperlipidemia occurs
with often striking elevation of plasma cholesterol and phospholipid levels. Fur-
thermore, the majority of this cholesterol is unesterified, in contrast to the normal
situation in which most plasma cholesterol is esterified. Much of this excess
cholesterol and phospholipid is contained in an abnormal plasma lipoprotein,
lipoprotein-X, which accumulates in individuals with cholestasis (Fig. 11.7).
Lipoprotein-X is isolated in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) density range in
the ultracentrifuge and consists mainly of free cholesterol and phospholipid. The
major protein components of lipoprotein-X are albumin and the apo C and
E peptides. Although the presence of lipoprotein-X in plasma is a sensitive
marker for cholestasis, it cannot reliably discriminate intrahepatic from extrahepatic
cholestasis. Interestingly, although certain cholestatic liver diseases may result in</p>

<p>markedly elevated lipoprotein-X levels with total serum cholesterol levels above
1,000 mg/dL, unlike LDL, this particle does not appear to be atherogenic and does
not increase the risk for cardiovascular disease.
</p>
<p>Mild to moderate parenchymal liver disease, such as typical acute viral hep-
atitis, usually results in an increase in plasma triglycerides, a less striking increase
in cholesterol (mostly free cholesterol), and a decrease in HDL. These changes are
thought to result from decreases in hepatic lipase, LCAT, and possibly peripheral
lipoprotein lipase. With severe parenchymal liver injury, such as fulminant
hepatitis disappearing HDL fraction portends an especially poor prognosis.
</p>
<p>The most common plasma lipid abnormality with acute and chronic ethanol
ingestion is hypertriglyceridemia contained in the triglyceride-rich very low density
lipoprotein fraction (VLDL) and results from increased hepatic synthesis and
secretion of VLDL. Chronic mild ethanol ingestion may result in only an elevation
of plasma HDL levels. In the presence of alcoholic hepatitis, in addition to the
abnormalities described for parenchymal liver disease, there is accumulation of
an abnormal discoidal HDL particle deficient in apolipoprotein A-I and rich in
apolipoprotein E. This may represent a nascent HDL particle persisting in the
circulation due to LCAT deficiency caused by the ethanol-induced liver injury.
</p>
<p>The current obesity epidemic in adults and children has resulted in a dramatic
increase in the accumulation of lipid in the liver, termed non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) (Fig. 11.8). In many cases, the steatosis of liver cells is also
associated with inflammation, which is then termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), and the development of cirrhosis. This disorder often accompanies the
metabolic syndrome, a constellation of abnormalities that includes insulin resis-
tance, hypertension, abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol
levels, and the presence of abnormal, highly atherogenic small, dense LDL particles.
In the presence of insulin resistance, free fatty acids are mobilized from adipose
tissue and are taken up by the liver, where they are re-esterified to triglyceride
and packaged into VLDL particles. These particles are secreted and result in
hypertriglyceridemia. However, overproduction often overwhelms the secretory</p>

</p>
<p>pathway, and triglyceride accumulates in the hepatocytes. Local events, such as
lipid peroxidation coupled with a systemic inflammatory state, may result in hepatic
inflammation (the so-called &ldquo;second hit&rdquo;) to produce NASH and progressive liver
disease with cirrhosis and, in some cases, the development of end-stage liver
disease, requiring transplantation, or hepatocellular carcinoma.
</p>
<p>Recently, the contribution of the intestinal microbiome to progression of
NAFLD and other liver diseases has been more clearly defined. The liver&rsquo;s location
at the interface between portal blood from the gut, which carries bacteria and
bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and metabolites, that have
breached the intestinal barrier, and the rest of the body, places it in an ideal position
to react to perturbations in the composition of the microbiome. The liver contains
immune cells, such as the Kupffer cell, and innate immune response receptors
that function in the initiation and modulation of inflammation, which plays a role
in diverse pathologic processes, including the metabolic syndrome, progression of
NAFLD to NASH, autoimmune liver diseases and others associated with immune
dysregulation. Future therapies targeting the gut microbiome may result in
prevention or amelioration of these diseases.
</p>
<p>5 Role of the Liver in Substrate/Energy Processing
</p>
<p>and Distribution During the Fed, Postabsorptive,
</p>
<p>and Fasting States
</p>
<p>The liver plays a pivotal role as a metabolic distribution center for the body in the
face of very different metabolic conditions characterizing the fed, postabsorptive,
and fasting states. In the fed state, nutrients absorbed from the small intestine
are abundant. Glucose is readily available as an energy substrate for brain and
red blood cells, which have no capacity for storage of glucose as glycogen. In
muscle, the glucose is taken up for storage as glycogen when needed for energy
production. However, unlike liver glycogen, muscle glycogen does not contribute
to maintenance of blood glucose levels. In the liver, the incoming glucose is stored
as glycogen. When glycogen stores are saturated, glucose is used for fatty acid
synthesis. As previously discussed, these fatty acids are esterified into triglycerides
and incorporated into VLDL, which are secreted and supply fatty acids to peripheral
tissues. Also as previously discussed, dietary lipid is distributed to peripheral tissues
and liver by intestinal chylomicron metabolism. These events are summarized in
Fig. 11.9.
</p>
<p>In the postabsorptive fasting state, the influx of dietary glucose is interrupted,
and the liver releases glucose from glycogen to maintain blood glucose levels
between meals for use by the brain. Amino acids released by muscle are substrates
for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Also, adipose tissue releases fatty acids into the
circulation, rather than storing them as triglycerides. Oxidation of glucose, as</p>

(Adapted with permission

</p>
<p>an energy source begins to decline and fatty acid oxidation by liver and muscle
increases. This scheme is summarized in Fig. 11.10.
</p>
<p>With prolonged fasting, hepatic glycogen stores are depleted within 48 h in
adults and more rapidly in children and infants. Gluconeogenesis in the liver
becomes more important as an energy source for brain and red blood cells.
Amino acids from muscle are the predominant substrates for this gluconeogenesis.
As fasting continues, fatty acids released from adipose tissue are oxidized to
ketones by the liver to supply alternative energy to the central nervous system.
The factors regulating these metabolic adaptations include liver sinusoidal glucose
concentrations and hormones (insulin, glucagon, and catecholamines).
</p>
<p>Glucose is readily taken up by the hepatocyte predominately by the glucose
transporter, GLUT2, that is regulated by glucose levels via SREBP-1c, and the intra-
cellular glucose concentration is generally the same as the sinusoidal concentration.
The velocity of the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by glucokinase is
dependent therefore on the sinusoidal glucose concentration. The amount of the
enzyme glucokinase is transcriptionally regulated by insulin concentrations. There-
fore, during and immediately after a meal, insulin and sinusoidal glucose levels
are high, and glucose is rapidly taken up, phosphorylated, and incorporated into
glycogen for storage and used as a substrate for fatty acid and amino acid synthesis
when glycogen stores are fully repleted. Increasing sinusoidal concentrations of</p>

<p>glucose result in activation of glycogen synthetase; this incorporates glucose into
glycogen, and decreased activity of the phosphorylase that breaks down glycogen
to release glucose. This process is reversed when sinusoidal glucose concentrations
are low.Glycogen synthetase and phosphorylase are activated by enzyme protein
dephosphorylation and phosphorylation, respectively. A cAMP-responsive protein
kinase is responsible for phosphorylating and thereby inactivating glycogen syn-
thetase directly. This same protein kinase activates a phosphorylase kinase which
in turn phosphorylates and activates phosphorylase. Regulatory factors involved in
this complex scheme involve glucagon and epinephrine, as well as hormones and
neural stimuli that affect intracellular calcium concentrations.

<p>6 Role of the Liver in Vitamin Metabolism
</p>
<p>6.1 Vitamin A
</p>
<p>Vitamin A is essential for normal vision, normal reproductive function, and
maintenance of epithelia throughout the body, including a role in processing cell
surface glycoprotein receptors. Dietary vitamin A from animal sources is present in</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11 Protein Synthesis and Nutrient Metabolism 287
</p>
<p>the intestine primarily as retinyl esters, which undergo cleavage prior to absorption
of the free retinol. Carotenoids from plant sources are converted to retinal, then
to retinol, prior to intestinal absorption. Retinol is a fat-soluble vitamin, requiring
bile salt solubilization for absorption. Although a portion of carotenoids is absorbed
intact, this fraction does not represent functional vitamin A. The absorbed retinol
is esterified with a fatty acid in the enterocyte, and the resultant retinyl esters
are incorporated into intestinal chylomicrons. Ultimately, the retinyl esters enter
the hepatocyte with chylomicron remnant uptake. After uptake, hydrolysis, and
reesterification by the hepatocyte, retinyl palmitate (over 90 % of total body reserve)
is stored mainly in hepatic non-parenchymal fat-storing (stellate) cells. Retinol is
mobilized as the free alcohol (retinol) bound to retinol binding protein (RBP),
which is synthesized by the hepatocyte. Nutritional retinol status regulates hepatic
RBP secretion. Also, an intracellular retinol binding protein (CRBP) is present in
hepatocytes and fat-storing cells. Retinol binding protein circulates complexed with
prealbumin (transthyretin), which also transports thyroid hormones and functions
to deliver retinol to peripheral tissues. Excess vitamin A intake results in stellate
cell overload with activation of these cells and production of excess collagen
resulting in liver fibrosis.
</p>
<p>6.2 Vitamin D
</p>
<p>Vitamin D is essential for normal calcium metabolism and maintenance of proper
bone mineralization. Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin and absorbed from
dietary sources, requiring bile salts for absorption.Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is
produced in the skin from the precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in a reaction requiring
ultraviolet light. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is found to a limited extent in plant
products and is the major form of dietary vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin
D3 is abundant in fish oils and eggs. Although vitamin D is incorporated into
chylomicrons, which are secreted into intestinal lymphatics, a significant proportion
is absorbed directly into the portal circulation. In the blood, vitamin D binds to
vitamin D binding protein (DBP) for transport to liver for 25-hydroxylation.After
hepatic 25-hydroxylation, 25-OH vitamin D is transported bound to DBP to kidney
for final hydroxylation to 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D. The liver does not significantly
store vitamin D. Reduced levels of 25-OH vitamin D may be seen in liver disease
because of reduced absorption of vitamin D with cholestasis and/or reduced hepatic
synthesis of DBP. Liver disease generally does not result in significantly reduced
vitamin D hydroxylation. Regulation of vitamin D metabolism occurs primarily
at the level of the kidney. Production of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D is enhanced
by parathyroid hormone and inhibited by elevated blood levels of calcium and
phosphorus. The metabolically active 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D regulates intestinal
absorption of dietary calcium and recruits stem cells to mature into osteoclasts,
which mobilize calcium from bone.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>288 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>6.3 Vitamin K
</p>
<p>Vitamin K is produced by intestinal bacteria and requires bile acids and pancreatic
secretions for the most efficient absorption. Other significant dietary sources of
vitamin K include liver, eggs, butter, cheese, and green, leafy vegetables. Vitamin
K is incorporated into chylomicrons in the enterocyte and is ultimately delivered
to the liver in chylomicron remnants. In the liver, vitamin K is incorporated into
VLDL, which are secreted from the liver with a significant proportion of the VLDL
being converted to LDL, allowing distribution of vitamin K throughout the body.
The liver synthesizes the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, prothrombin
and factors VII, IX, and X, as well as protein C and S. Vitamin K is required
for the posttranslational formation of &rdquo;-carboxyglutamic acid from specific
glutamic acid residues on these proteins during hepatic synthesis. Without this
carboxylation, the secreted factors are not functional in the clotting cascade.
Whenever one observes a coagulopathy in an individual with liver dysfunction,
particularly cholestatic liver disease, vitamin K should be administered parenterally.
If the coagulopathy corrects, it was likely due to vitamin K deficiency. If not, the
coagulopathy is probably secondary to severe liver synthetic failure.

<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>A three and a half month-old male infant is brought to the emergency room having
a generalized seizure. The infant was born to a 22-year-old G1P0Ab0 female after
an uneventful term pregnancy. The vaginal vertex delivery went smoothly, and there
were no perinatal problems. The birth weight was 8 lb and 12 oz. The infant was
breast-fed from birth and has had no apparent problems until approximately 20 min
before arrival at the hospital when he was noted to be poorly responsive and began
having generalized jerking movements, prompting the parents to call an ambulance.
In the emergency room a blood glucose is found to be 13 mg/dL. The infant is given
an intravenous push of glucose, and the seizure activity stops within seconds. On
examination the infant is postictal, but responsive. The baby is noted to have a &ldquo;doll-
like&rdquo; appearance with chubby cheeks, a protuberant abdomen, and thin extremities.
Abdominal examination reveals a massively enlarged liver extending down into the
right pelvis and the left lobe extending across the midline to the left upper quadrant.
Both kidneys are detectable and felt to be enlarged on deep palpation. There is no
splenomegaly.

</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Answer: The constellation of hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia,
hyperlipidemia, nephromegaly, and massive hepatomegaly in an infant with
&ldquo;cherubic&rdquo; facies with normal liver synthetic function and minimally elevated
transaminases suggests a diagnosis of glycogen storage disease type I (von
Gierke&rsquo;s disease, glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency), an autosomal recessively
inherited disorder. The presence of neutropenia would suggest further classifi-
cation as type Ib, which is caused by mutations in the glucose-6-phosphate
translocase gene, resulting in defective microsomal membrane transport of
glucose-6-phosphate. Inability to generate glucose from glucose-6-phosphate
results in a block in the final steps of the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic
pathways, which causes the fasting hypoglycemia observed in these patients.
There is generally no ketosis in the face of profound hypoglycemia. Accumula-
tion of glucose-6-phosphate results in increased shunting of this substrate into the
glycolytic pathway with generation of lactic acid. Hyperuricemia is caused by
both decreased renal clearance and increased production. Lactate competes for
uric acid excretion by the kidney, and hepatic accumulation of phosphate esters
causes increased degradation of adenine nucleotides with resultant increased
uric acid production. Hyperlipidemia is caused by increased hepatic production
of triglycerides and VLDL due to overproduction of NADH, NADPH, acetyl-
CoA and glycerol by the glycolytic pathway, which serve as the co-factors and
substrates for lipogenesis.
</p>
<p>These patients are generally hyperinsulinemic, which results in decreased
activity of peripheral lipoprotein lipase and decreased lipolysis of triglyceride-
rich lipoproteins. Striking hepatomegaly is caused by accumulation of glycogen
and triglyceride in the hepatocytes. Renal enlargement is found early in life,
and renal disease is a late complication with hypertension, proteinuria, and
nephrolithiasis. Most patients have growth retardation and delayed puberty.
Diagnosis of this disorder requires liver biopsywith demonstration of decreased
glucose-6-phosphatase activity (type Ia) or deficiency of one of three micro-
somal translocase systems (type Ib). Genetic diagnosis is also available. There
are other types of glycogen storage disease involving various steps in the
synthesis and breakdown of hepatic and muscle glycogen. A photograph of an
infant with glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency is shown in Fig. 11.11.
</p>
<p>2. How would you treat this patient?
The cornerstone of therapy is maintenance of normoglycemia. This may be
accomplished by the ingestion of raw cornstarch, which acts as a timed-
release form of glucose in the GI tract, or use of continuous nasogastric drip</p>

</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
The Alagille syndrome or arteriohepatic dysplasia consists of the findings
of cholestasis with intrahepatic ductal paucity, short stature, peculiar facies,
peripheral pulmonic stenosis or more complex heart lesions, failure of com-
plete vertebral body or arch fusion resulting in &ldquo;butterfly&rdquo; vertebral bodies on
X-ray, posterior embryotoxon on slit lamp eye exam, and renal abnormalities.
This disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable
penetrance, as well as a high spontaneous mutation rate, accounting for the
frequent finding of an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic parent or lack of
one or more characteristic features in probands. The disorder is due tomutations
of the JAG1 or NOTCH2 genes that are involved in intercellular signaling during
embryonic development. Although cholestasis may be severe, most patients
do not develop cirrhosis and liver failure. However, some patients eventually
require liver transplantation. Two striking features of this disease are the severe
cholestasis with markedly elevated serum bile acids and pruritis in the face of
a normal or only slightly elevated bilirubin and the resulting marked hyperc-
holesterolemia with xanthoma formation. The majority of the serum cholesterol
is unesterified and contained in lipoprotein-X. These patients also often have
low HDL cholesterol levels. It is interesting that even though these patients may
have serum cholesterol levels many fold higher than individuals with familial
hypercholesterolemia and elevated LDL cholesterol, premature atherosclerosis
is not observed. However, a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis and severe
cholestasis with an extremely high lipoprotein-X level has been reported with
complications from a resultant hyperviscosity syndrome with neurologic and
cardiovascular impairment. Also, these patients have a vasculopathy that
may result in blood vessel rupture and spontaneous bleeding, and may be fatal,
especially with an intracranial site of bleeding.</p>

<p>292 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>2. How would you treat this patient?
Chronic administration of oral ursodeoxycholic acid appears to result in
improvement in the cholestasis and pruritis, as well as the serum lipid profile,
in some patients. This non-toxic, water-soluble bile acid acts as a choleretic to
increase bile flow and after chronic administration may make up 40 % or more
of the bile acid pool, displacing more toxic bile acids, which may contribute
to the liver disease. Some patients may achieve the same result by chronic
external biliary diversion using a cholecystojejunal conduit or ileal diversion
for bile acid pool depletion.Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation is a necessity
with particular attention to vitamin E. Severe vitamin E deficiency may develop
in these patients with resultant neurologic symptoms, including weakness,
opthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia, and decreased vibratory and proprioceptive
sensation. This patient&rsquo;s prothrombin time corrected to normal within 24 h after
a parenteral injection of vitamin K.
</p>
<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A 48-year-old white male is referred for evaluation of the recent onset of chest pain
with exertion. He works as an investment banker, has a very sedentary lifestyle
with no regular exercise and smokes two packs per day. He eats out frequently
with high-fat and high-sugar foods. He drinks an average of 1&ndash;2 beers per day. On
physical examination his weight is 88 kg with a BMI of 27.8 (overweight range) and
blood pressure of 152/103. His waist to hip ratio is 1:4 (normal &lt;1.0), indicating
abdominal obesity. The cardiovascular exam is otherwise normal. The abdominal
exam is normal except for hepatomegaly with the liver edge 5 cm below the right
costal margin.
</p>
<p>Laboratory studies: Hematocrit 46 %; hemoglobin 15.3 g/dL; white blood
cell count 10,600 cells/mm3 (4,500&ndash;13,500); 289, 000 platelets/mm3 (150,000&ndash;
350,000); prothrombin time 11.1 s (control 12.4 s); fasting glucose 160 mg/dL
(&lt;120); glycosylated hemoglobin 9 % (&lt;6 %); fasting insulin 48 �U/mL (&lt;25),
C-reactive protein 3.2 mg/dL (&lt;1); albumin 4.2 g/dL (3.7&ndash;5.6); total bilirubin
1.1 mg/dL; direct bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL; ALT 199 IU/L (10&ndash;30), AST 180 IU/L (15&ndash;
30); alkaline phosphatase 89 IU/L (25&ndash;100); total serum cholesterol 260 mg/dL
(&lt;202); triglycerides 493 mg/dL (&lt;150), and HDL cholesterol 26 mg/dL (&gt;40);
LDL cholesterol 146 mg/dL (&lt;100); apo B 209 mg/dL (&lt;125).
</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. Is this patient at high risk for serious health problems?
Yes, he fits the criteria for metabolic syndrome: abdominal obesity; hyper-
tension; insulin resistance that is now manifest as frank type 2 diabetes, as
indicated by elevated glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and insulin levels; and
hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL cholesterol levels, as well as elevated LDL
cholesterol with apo B levels (a reflection of LDL particle number) consistent
with highly atherogenic small, dense LDL particles. He also has elevated
CRP levels, a marker for inflammation, which may be a component of the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>11 Protein Synthesis and Nutrient Metabolism 293
</p>
<p>metabolic syndrome. His chest pain may be due to angina from atherosclerotic
coronary artery disease, and the patient needs a comprehensive evaluation by
a cardiologist. Finally, the hepatomegaly and elevated transaminase levels are
consistent with the presence of NAFLD.
</p>
<p>2. How would you approach making the diagnosis of NAFLD?
Other causes of liver disease, including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease,
A-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, and Wilson disease, should be
ruled out. Imaging of the liver with CT or MRI (Chap. 10) may be used to
detect fatty liver. Serum markers for fibrosis or elastography may be helpful
in detecting advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Finally, a percutaneous liver
biopsy will help confirm steatosis, as well as degree of fibrosis and the presence
of inflammation, which would indicate progression to NASH.
</p>
<p>3. How would you treat this patient?
Treatment of metabolic syndrome encompasses comprehensive lifestyle changes,
including weight reduction, regular exercise, and dietary reduction of total
calories with particular attention to eliminating sugar, especially fructose-
containing foods, and refined carbohydrates. Effective medications are available
to treat insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Treatment with vita-
min E supplementation, as an antioxidant, reduces serum transaminase levels
and improves liver histology (but not fibrosis). However, at higher doses this
therapy may be associated with significant adverse effects. Insulin sensitizers,
such as thiazolidinediones, may also be an effective therapy, but may also be
associated with serious adverse effects with long-term use. Recent data suggest
that the intestinal microbiota may play a role in the development of NAFLD, and
alteration of the microbiome by the use of probioticsmay prove to be a useful
therapeutic approach. Bariatric surgery for morbid obesity improves insulin
resistance and diabetes and may also improve NAFLD, but more study is needed
to define associated risks.

<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The liver detoxifies and excretes both exogenous xenobiotics, such as drugs
and environmental toxins, and endogenous substances, including ammonia and
bilirubin. Efficient processing and elimination of these substances prevent cellular
injury, including CNS toxicity in the case of ammonia and bilirubin. Hepatic
synthesis, secretion and re-uptake of bile acids is an exquisitely regulated process
that allows modulation of cholesterol metabolism and efficient absorption of the
products of fat digestion, as well as compensatory trafficking of bile acids out of
the hepatocyte in the face of bile acid retention as occurs in cholestasis. Nuclear
receptor transcription factors tightly regulate these processes and offer potential
therapeutic targets for new approaches to treatment of a variety of diseases. This
chapter reviews these important functions of the liver, underscoring another aspect
of its central role in human physiology.

<p>2 Urea Synthesis and Ammonia Metabolism
</p>
<p>The urea cycle (Fig. 12.1) is responsible for clearing the majority of the body&rsquo;s
excess nitrogen and producing arginine for protein synthesis or conversion to urea.
All five enzymes are located primarily in the zone 1 periportal hepatocytes.
The first two enzymes are in the mitochondrial matrix and the other three are in
the cytosol. As shown in Fig. 12.1, ammonia is the common substrate for entry
into the cycle. Ammonia is derived from several sources in the body, including
the degradation of amino acids, amines, and nucleic acids. Ammonia is also a

</p>
<p>byproduct of bacterial degradation of urea in the gastrointestinal tract, which
diffuses into the bowel lumen from the bloodstream. Urease-producing bacteria
in the lumen of the colon split the urea, as well as luminal amino acids, into
CO2 and ammonia. The ammonia then diffuses back into the bloodstream into
the portal circulation and is cleared by the liver, predominantly on the first pass.
Glutamate is produced in large quantities from the catabolism of amino acids.
Glutamate serves as a major source of urea by undergoing transamination in
the liver to aspartate, which then enters the urea cycle. Although several organs
produce urea, the liver is the only quantitatively important organ. Skeletal muscle
is capable of ammonia detoxification by the reaction of glutamate with ammonia
to produce glutamine. Ammonia clearance by skeletal muscle is the reason for the
higher ammonia concentration in arterial than in venous blood. In skeletal muscle,
protein catabolism generates large amounts of ammonia resulting in formation of
glutamate by transamination, and the glutamate is converted to alanine. Alanine is
transported to the liver, where glutamate is regenerated by transamination of alanine
to pyruvate. Ammonia is then released from the glutamate and enters the urea cycle.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 Biotransformation, Elimination and Bile Acid Metabolism 297
</p>
<p>The pyruvate is a substrate for gluconeogenesis to produce glucose, which may
circulate back to the muscle for energy production.
</p>
<p>The urea cycle is subject to both short- and long-term regulation. Short-
term regulation is accomplished by intracellular substrate levels. In long-term
regulation, total hepatic content of the five urea cycle enzymes is proportional to
protein intake and rate of urea excretion.All five urea cycle enzymesmay be induced
by glucagon and glucocorticoids. The rate-limiting enzyme in vivo is probably
carbamylphosphate synthetase I.
</p>
<p>Ammonia is toxic to the central nervous system, and in disorders characterized
by hyperammonemia, there is increased movement of ammonia across the blood&ndash;
brain barrier. The cells most susceptible to ammonia toxicity are the astrocytic
or glial cells. Astrocytes are the site of ammonia detoxification in the central
nervous system with glutamine production from glutamate, a major excitatory
neurotransmitter in the brain. In fact, cerebrospinal fluid glutamine levels parallel
the severity of neurologic dysfunction. As the level of glutamate declines, it is
replenished by condensation of ammonia with &rsquo;-ketoglutarate. Depletion of &rsquo;-
ketoglutarate results in impaired mitochondrial glucose oxidation. Ammonia
may also adversely affect neurotransmitter function and directly interfere with
cellular energy production.As the degree of hyperammonemia increases, neurologic
function progressively deteriorates with onset of deepening coma and finally
development of cerebral edema, which is often a terminal event.
</p>
<p>Inherited defects in the urea cycle enzymes may result in hyperammonemia
and neurologic dysfunction, often to a severe degree. Inherited defects in all five
enzymes of the cycle, as well as N-acetylglutamate synthetase (which produces an
essential cofactor for carbamyl phosphate synthetase), have been described. There
may be a spectrum of severity, depending on the specific defect in the enzyme and
whether there is partial residual function. In severe cases, seizures, coma, and death
may occur in the neonatal period, if untreated.
</p>
<p>3 Hepatic Encephalopathy
</p>
<p>Hepatic encephalopathy may be classified as two general types. In patients with
cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and large portosystemic shunts, ammonia from
intestinal sources is not cleared effectively on first-pass through the liver. Also, the
relief of portal hypertension by surgical creation of a portosystemic shunt or place-
ment of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may precipitate
encephalopathy. This ineffective clearance, combined with generally poor hepatic
function, may result in chronic encephalopathy, punctuated by acute exacerbations
often precipitated by gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices (resulting
in an increased intestinal ammonia load), infection, excessive protein intake, or
overzealous diuresis to treat ascites. Chronic pathologic changes in astrocytes in the
central nervous system may be present. This type of encephalopathy is referred to as</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>298 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>portosystemic encephalopathy. The other category of encephalopathy is observed
in the patient with acute, severe liver disease (usually fulminant hepatitis) who
develops progressive encephalopathy due primarily to severe liver dysfunction with
inadequate ammonia detoxification. Acute liver failure with encephalopathy often
rapidly progresses to cerebral edema and death. The cerebral edema is thought to be
a direct result of ammonia toxicity. In fact, the edema may actually be a result of the
osmotic effect of ammonia-induced elevation of brain glutamine levels.
</p>
<p>It should be stressed that in encephalopathy associated with liver disease,
other factors may contribute to the central nervous system dysfunction in addition
to hyperammonemia. In fact, the degree of hyperammonemia does not always
correlate with the degree of encephalopathy, suggesting that other mechanisms
may be involved. In acute liver failure, other neurotoxic substances, such as
mercaptans and short-chain fatty acids, may play a role. There is evidence that
hepatic encephalopathymay result in part from the action of endogenous substances
that bind to the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the brain. This is
supported clinically by the observation that portosystemic encephalopathy and
encephalopathy associated with acute liver failure may improve transiently with
treatment with benzodiazepine receptor antagonists. However, there are limited data
to support their clinical use. There may be increased entry of ammonia into the
central nervous system due to increased permeability of the blood&ndash;brain barrier and
conversion of positively charged ammonium ion to ammonia, which more readily
crosses the blood&ndash;brain barrier, secondary to changes in blood pH. Accumulation
of glutamine in the brain results in enhanced central nervous system uptake of
tryptophan, which is converted into both neuroactive and neurotoxic metabolites,
including serotonin and tryptamine.
</p>
<p>Clinically, the presentation of the first stage of hepatic encephalopathy may
be subtle. There may be personality changes and inversion of sleep patterns.
The patient may exhibit a short attention span and easy forgetfulness. With
portosystemic encephalopathy, it is now recognized that very mild impairment may
affect social skills and emotional behavior, and evaluation of driving skills may
be a practical index to diagnose what is termed minimal hepatic encephalopathy
(MHE). An early physical sign of hepatic encephalopathy is asterixis. This sign
represents an inability to maintain posture and is usually elicited by asking the
patient to dorsiflex the hand with the arm extended. After several seconds a positive
sign is characterized by the hand falling forward followed by a brisk recovery,
thereby resulting in the typical &ldquo;flapping&rdquo; tremor. This sign is dependent upon
the patient being able to understand and follow directions, and is highly variable
over short periods of time, even in the same individual. Asterixis is not specific for
hepatic encephalopathy and may be elicited in other disorders, including uremia.
In stage 2, the individual becomes lethargic and disoriented with other abnormal
reflexes in addition to asterixis. In stage 3, the patient is somnolent, but arousable.
However, when awake the patient is unable to communicate or perform mental
tasks such as calculation. Stage 4 encephalopathy is characterized by total inability
to arouse the patient accompanied by a positive Babinski sign and decerebrate</p>
<p/>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 Biotransformation, Elimination and Bile Acid Metabolism 299
</p>
<p>posturing, and usually immediately precedes the development of cerebral edema
and death. Abnormal changes on electroencephalogram (EEG) are detectable as
early as stage 1 and generally worsen in parallel with clinical progression to
stage 4.
</p>
<p>Treatment of hyperammonemia should be directed toward reducing the pro-
duction of ammonia and enhancing its clearance. Moderate protein restriction
had been recommended in the past. However, since restriction results in enhanced
catabolism of endogenous protein, and a significant positive effect on outcomes
has yet to be proven, such restriction is not currently recommended. Branched-
chain amino acid supplementation may have a modest beneficial effect, but is
prohibitively expensive. Attention should be directed to sources of gastrointestinal
bleeding, such as esophageal varices, which may result in a large intestinal ammonia
load. Lactulose is a non-absorbable carbohydrate administered enterally and is
fermented by colonic bacteria to form organic acids, which lower the luminal pH.
Since only ammonia in the form of NH3 is readily absorbed, an increase in the
NH4C/NH3 ratio results in trapping of ammonia in the gut and elimination in the
feces. Also, the osmotic property of lactulose results in a significant laxative effect
and may effectively clear ammoniagenic substances from the gastrointestinal tract.
The non-absorbable antibiotic, rifaximin, is used to suppress intestinal ammonia-
forming bacteria. In urgent situations, high ammonia levels may also be cleared
by hemodialysis or exchange transfusion. Use of external liver support systems
has generally not significantly impacted outcomes. The molecular absorbent
recirculating system (MARS) has shown some benefit in more severe cases. In
cases of encephalopathy associated with liver failure, liver transplantation may
result in prompt resolution of severe encephalopathy, providing that cerebral edema
has not developed.
</p>
<p>4 Hepatic Detoxification
</p>
<p>The liver is responsible for the biotransformation and clearance of a variety
of endogenous and exogenous toxic compounds. Exogenous organic substances
entering the body that have no nutritive value for energy production, structural
function, or enzyme cofactor function are called xenobiotics. The liver is capable
of numerous reactions which generally serve to make the substance to be eliminated
more polar and water soluble to subsequently be excreted in bile or urine (Phase
I reactions: oxidoreductases and hydrolases) and to make the substance less
toxic (Phase II reactions: transferases). As will also be demonstrated, these
reactions do not always result in detoxification, but may actually form toxic
intermediary metabolites. Apical canalicular excretion of these biotransformed
molecules into bile for elimination or basolateral membrane transport into the
circulation to be cleared by the kidney occurs via specific ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters and is termed Phase III transport.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>300 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>4.1 Phase I Reactions
</p>
<p>The enzyme systems responsible for oxidation and reduction reactions are com-
ponents of Phase I biotransformation. Dehydrogenases catalyze hydrogen trans-
fer from a substrate to a hydrogen receptor, frequently a pyridine nucleotide.
Examples include alcohol dehydrogenases, cytosolic enzymes, which catalyze
NAD-dependent oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones by the following
reaction:
</p>
<p>RCH2OHC NADC ! RCHOCNADHC HC
</p>
<p>Aldehyde dehydrogenases are present in mitochondrial, microsomal, and
cytosolic hepatocyte fractions. The production of aldehydes from alcohols in
the above reaction is reversible. However, conversion of the aldehydes to ketones
by aldehyde dehydrogenases is essentially irreversible:
</p>
<p>RCHOC NADC C H2O ! RCOOHC NADHC HC
</p>
<p>Another dehydrogenase is dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the
NADPC-dependent oxidation of metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
compounds.
</p>
<p>Hepatic reductases include aldehyde and ketone reductases, quinone reduc-
tases, nitro and nitroso reductases, azoreductases,N-oxide reductases, and sulfoxide
reductases. Substrates for these enzymes are drugs and xenobiotics, including
warfarin, aflatoxin, adriamycin, chloramphenicol, and dimethylsulfoxide.Oxidases
catalyze transfer of electrons from substrate to oxygen, generating either hydrogen
peroxide or superoxide anions, and include aldehyde oxidases and monoamine
oxidases.
</p>
<p>The hepatic mono-oxygenases are microsomal enzymes that catalyze reactions
in which one atom of oxygen is incorporated into product and the other is reduced
to water:
</p>
<p>RC O2 C NADPHC H
C
! ROC H2OC NADP
</p>
<p>C
</p>
<p>The cytochrome P450-dependent mono-oxygenases have been the most inten-
sively studied. Although these enzymes are found in many tissues throughout the
body, they are most abundant in the liver. Within the hepatocyte this system is
located primarily in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. It is also found in the
nuclear membrane, where this fraction is probably more important in carcinogen-
esis. The system derives its name from &ldquo;P&rdquo; which stands for &ldquo;pigment&rdquo; and &ldquo;450&rdquo;
which indicates the absorption wavelength in nm at which a maximum occurs with
the binding of carbon monoxide under anaerobic conditions. This mono-oxygenase
system consists of a flavoprotein and a family of hemoproteins. The scheme for
the function of this complex is shown in Fig. 12.2. In the first step, the oxidized</p>

Fe3C state. In the fourth step, the ternary complex decomposes to yield the free
oxidized cytochrome, the oxidized form of the substrate, and water. The entire
cycle involves a two-electron transfer and consumption of one mole of NADPH
and one mole of molecular oxygen per mole of drug reduced. The components
of this system are integral membrane proteins. Reconstitution of the proteins in
vitro requires the presence of phospholipid for a catalytically active complex. These
mono-oxygenases are subject to genetic variation and can be induced or inhibited
by xenobiotics, which may affect the metabolism of certain drugs.

<p>Hydrolytic reactions involve substrates that contain ester linkages. Hydrolases
cleave ester linkages with addition of a molecule of water:
</p>
<p>RCOORC H2O ! RCOOHC ROH
</p>
<p>The products of this hydrolysis, an acid and an alcohol, are more water-soluble
than the parent ester. In addition to increasing water solubility, this reaction often
results in detoxification of the xenobiotic. The reaction products may also be
substrates for Phase II reactions. Xenobiotics subject to hydrolysis include aspirin,
meperidine, malathion, and nerve gas.</p>

<p>4.2 Phase II Reactions
</p>
<p>The general scheme for conjugation reactions is as follows:
</p>
<p>SubstrateC Donor-A ! Substrate-AC Donor
</p>
<p>One of the most common conjugation reactions is glucuronidation. Glucuronic
acid is transferred from UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) to the hydroxyl or
carboxyl group on the acceptor substrate molecule to form a &ldquo;-glucuronide.
Glucuronidation generally not only enhances water solubility, but also detoxifies
the compound. Substrates for this reaction include acetaminophen, morphine,
chloramphenicol, furosemide, sulfisoxazole, and valproic acid. As discussed sub-
sequently, bilirubin, an endogenous waste product of heme catabolism, is a major
substrate for conjugationwith glucuronide. The glucuronidation capacity of the liver
depends on the rate of synthesis of UDPGA from UDP-glucose, which requires
adequate carbohydrate reserves. Another Phase II conjugation reaction is sulfation.
Conjugationwith sulfate generally results in compounds that are less toxic and more
water-soluble. Substrates for this reaction include alcohols, bile acids, and phenolic
compounds.
</p>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide (&rdquo;-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) which partic-
ipates in substitution reactions that are catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases,
whereby the GSH displaces a group on a xenobiotic, which generally has an
electrophilic center. Electrophilic compounds are particularly toxic to cells because
of their propensity to react spontaneously with -SH groups on proteins or amine
groups on nucleic acids, leading to cell necrosis or carcinogenesis. Substrates for
this reaction include nitroglycerin, the diuretic ethacrynic acid, certain insecticides,
and sulfobromophthalein (BSP). The GSH conjugates are generally excreted into
bile. However, they may be reabsorbed in the intestine and subsequently taken up
by the kidney, where the enzyme &rdquo;-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGTP) transfers the
&rdquo;-glutamyl group of the conjugate to an amino acid, leaving the cysteine-glycine
conjugate. A dipeptidase then removes the glycine, producing the cysteine conju-
gate. This conjugate may be excreted in the urine or acetylated to mercapturic
acid in the liver or kidney. The mercapturic acids may be excreted in urine, and to a
lesser extent, in bile. Under certain conditions, such as acetaminophen overdosage
to be discussed subsequently, the GSH stores may be depleted and the potential for
toxicity greatly increases.
</p>
<p>Methylation is another Phase II reaction, which serves mainly to detoxify
and actually may render some substrates less water-soluble. In this reaction the
methyl group of S-adenosylmethionine is transferred to an acceptor xenobiotic
that contains a polyphenol, amine, or sulfhydryl group. Substrates for this reaction
include norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and tyramine and other catachols
after hydroxylation by the cytochrome P450 system.</p>

<p>12 Biotransformation, Elimination and Bile Acid Metabolism 303
</p>
<p>5 Bioactivation and Hepatocellular Injury
</p>
<p>Although the biotransformation reactions just described generally function to
detoxify and enhance the elimination of xenobiotics, there are instances in which
the substrates are actually rendered more toxic or carcinogenic. There are five
classes of such biotransformation. The xenobiotic may be transformed into a
stable, but toxic metabolite. Examples include acetonitrile and methoxyflurane.
A second class involves transformation into a reactive, electrophilic metabolite.
Acetaminophen and furosemide are in this class. Third, the substrate may be
converted to a free radical, as in the case of carbon tetrachloride. Fourth,
the biotransformation reaction may lead to the formation of reduced oxygen
metabolites, as occurs with paraquat and quinones. Finally, the biotransformation
reaction itself may generate a metabolic derangement within the cell, as in the
case of galactosamine-induced liver injury, where there is a depression of uracil
nucleotide dependent biosynthesis of nucleic acids, glycolipids, glycoproteins, and
glycogen, which results in cell organelle injury.
</p>
<p>Review of the biochemical events occurring in acetaminophen toxicity serves as
an excellent example of these metabolic pathways. These events are summarized
in Fig. 12.3. When taken in appropriate doses, most of the acetaminophen is

</p>
<p>conjugated with sulfate and glucuronic acid and eliminated. About 5-15 % is
converted to a reactive, electrophilic intermediate,N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine
(NAPQI), which reacts with sulfhydryl groups in proteins. The NAPQI is normally
immediately conjugated with glutathione before it can do any damage to the cell
and is converted into a mercapturic acid for mainly renal elimination. However,
in the case of an overdose the conjugation pathway is saturated and available
glutathione is quickly depleted, allowing accumulation of significant amounts of
NAPQI. The NAPQI causes cell injury and death resulting in the hepatic necrosis
seen with acetaminophen overdose, which can result in liver failure and death.
Obviously, one therapeutic strategy would be repletion of the liver&rsquo;s glutathione
stores. Although this cannot be done directly, another successful approach is to
administer N-acetylcysteine (MucomistR), which restores glutathione levels by
enhancing synthesis. If administered early enough in the course of intoxication, this
intervention can effectively prevent significant liver injury.
</p>
<p>6 Hepatic Bilirubin Metabolism
</p>
<p>Bilirubin is a pigment derived from the catabolism of heme. It is a toxic waste
product, which undergoes hepatic biotransformation and excretion in bile. Bilirubin
has an open-chain tetrapyrrole structure with eight side chains (Fig. 12.4). The
IX-&rsquo; isomer is the most abundant naturally occurring isomer of bilirubin. From
the chemical structure of bilirubin, one would predict a water-soluble compound at
</p>

occurring form. (M, CH3; V, CH2 D CH2; P, CH2-CH2-COOH.) (Reproduced with permission

<p>physiological pH. However, in reality, unconjugated bilirubin has only very limited
water solubility. This phenomenon may be explained by the presence of extensive
internal hydrogen bonding within the molecule as shown in Fig. 12.5. This results
in the involvement of all of the polar groups of the molecule in the hydrogen
bonding, so that none are available for hydration.
</p>
<p>Normally, serum bilirubin levels are very low, and unconjugated bilirubin
predominates. In normal individuals, men have slightly higher serum bilirubin levels
(0.6 mg/dL) than females (0.4 mg/dL), and any level above 1.0 mg/dL is considered
abnormal. Jaundice with the appearance of the pigment in sclerae, skin, and mucus
membranes generally is noted when the bilirubin level exceeds 3 mg/dL in adults
and 6 mg/dL in infants.
</p>
<p>The major site of bilirubin toxicity is the central nervous system, particularly
in the newborn infant. Bilirubin inhibits central nervous system RNA and protein
synthesis, uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, and inhibits ATPase activity in
brain mitochondria. Clinically, bilirubin toxicity can produce severe central nervous
system dysfunction resulting in permanent injury or death. Accumulation of biliru-
bin in the brain, primarily in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and cochlear and
cerebellar nuclei, with associated toxicity is termed kernicterus.</p>

<p>Fig. 12.6 Pathways of biliverdin production from heme by chain-opening and bilirubin production
by reduction of biliverdin (Reproduced with permission from Odell [15])
</p>
<p>Bilirubin is the major degradation product of heme in mammals. Degradation of
hemoglobin from senescent red blood cells by reticuloendothelial cells in the spleen
accounts for 80% of bilirubin production. The other 20% is derived from ineffective
erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, as well as the turnover of heme-containing
proteins and myoglobin. The series of reactions responsible for the conversion of
heme into bilirubin is shown in Fig. 12.6. The first step is the conversion of heme to
biliverdinmediated by the enzyme heme oxygenase, which exists as three isoforms.
The activity of this microsomal enzyme is highest in the spleen and Kupffer cells
in the liver and requires NADPH and oxygen. This is the only reaction in the
body that produces carbon monoxide, which is excreted in expired air and may
be quantitated as an index of bilirubin production. Carbon monoxide is also an
important signaling molecule and functions as a potent vasodilator. Interestingly,
biliverdin is a non-toxic, water-soluble compound and is the end-product of heme
catabolism in birds and other non-mammalian vertebrates. However, in mammals
biliverdin is converted to bilirubin, which is toxic and requires energy-dependent
biotransformation for excretion. Conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin also occurs in
reticuloendothelial cells by biliverdin reductase, a cytosolic enzyme that requires
NADPH, and utilizes NADH at lower pH. Both bilirubin and biliverdin may
have beneficial effects as anti-oxidants under certain conditions and may affect
progression of atherosclerosis.
</p>
<p>After its formation in reticuloendothelial cells, bilirubin is released into the
bloodstream, where it is transported bound to albumin via one primary and
two secondary binding sites. This binding prevents the diffusion of free bilirubin
into tissues, particularly the central nervous system, thereby preventing toxicity.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 Biotransformation, Elimination and Bile Acid Metabolism 307
</p>
<p>Fig. 12.7 Summary of hepatic transport and metabolism of bilirubin. During its carriage in
plasma, bilirubin is strongly, but reversibly, bound to albumin. In hepatic sinusoids, this complex
comes in direct contact with the basolateral domain of the hepatocyte plasma membrane through
fenestrae of the specialized hepatic endothelial cells. At the hepatocyte surface, dissociation
of the albumin&ndash;bilirubin complex occurs, and bilirubin enters hepatocytes by a specific uptake
mechanism(s). A fraction of the bilirubin is also derived from catabolism of hepatocellular
heme proteins. Storage within the hepatocyte is accomplished by binding of bilirubin to a
group of cytosolic proteins, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) (also termed ligandin or Y-protein).
Binding to these proteins keeps bilirubin in solution and inhibits its efflux from the cell,
thereby increasing the net uptake. Conjugation of bilirubin in the endoplasmic reticulum is
catalyzed by bilirubin-uridinediphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1), forming
bilirubin monoglucuronide and diglucuronide. Both conjugates may bind to GSTs in the cytosol.
Conjugation is obligatory for efficient transport across the bile canaliculus. Bilirubin glucuronides
are secreted across the bile canaliculus by an energy-consuming process mediated by MRP2
(previously termed cMOAT). This process is normally rate-limiting in bilirubin throughput,
and is shared by other organic anions, but not bile salts (Reproduced with permission from
Elsevier [17])
</p>
<p>However, other ligands such as drugs (salicylates, sulfonamides, furosemide, etc.)
and fatty acids can displace bilirubin from albumin binding sites and precipitate
toxicity.
</p>
<p>At the hepatocyte plasma membrane, bilirubin enters the hepatocyte via a
specific uptake mechanism, as shown in Fig. 12.7. Once inside the cell, bilirubin
binds to a group of cytosolic carrier proteins, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs),
also termed ligandin or Y protein, keeping the bilirubin in solution and within
the cell. The bilirubin is then conjugated with glucuronide by the microsomal
enzyme, bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1). The resulting biliru-
bin monoglucuronide and diglucuronide are excreted at the canalicular membrane
as a component of bile by the ATP-dependent transporter MRP2 (ABCC2).</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>308 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>The transcription factors, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane
X receptor (PXR), regulate the various proteins involved in bilirubin uptake,
glucuronidation and secretion. Conjugation renders bilirubin non-toxic, water-
soluble, and non-absorbable from the gastrointestinal tract. In the distal small
intestinal and colonic lumen, the conjugated bilirubin is converted to urobilinogens
by bacteria and eliminated in stool. However, a small fraction of these tetrapyrroles
may be reabsorbed and re-excreted in bile, and the kidney excretes a small fraction.
</p>
<p>In the fetus, the placenta is the only available mechanism for clearance of waste
products. Therefore, conjugated bilirubin excreted by the liver into the intestinal
lumen is deconjugated by an intestinal &ldquo;-glucuronidase and reabsorbed to be
ultimately cleared by the placenta. Normal infants may experience a transient
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the first week of life caused by immaturity of
bilirubin conjugation, as well as enhanced enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin,
potentially due to postpartum persistence of intestinal &ldquo;-glucuronidase activity.
Newborn infants may develop unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia as a consequence
of breastfeeding. There appears to be a factor in certain breast milks, which
enhances the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin leading to the unconjugated
hyperbilirubinemia of &ldquo;breast milk jaundice&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Disorders of bilirubin metabolism may occur at several of the metabolic steps
just described. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may occur when there is an
overproduction of bilirubin from red blood cell hemolysis, as may occur in the
newborn with a maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility or an extravascular
accumulation of blood, such as a hematoma. There may be defective bilirubin
conjugation. In the Crigler-Najjar syndrome, there is a genetic defect in UGT1A1.
In autosomal recessively inherited type I of this syndrome, there is complete
absence of enzyme activity, resulting in severe hyperbilirubinemia and often death
from kernicterus. In type II there is reduced, but not absent, transferase activity.
This residual activity is inducible by phenobarbital treatment, and this form
of the disorder usually has a more favorable prognosis, although kernicterus can
occasionally occur.
</p>
<p>The Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition, which is relatively common
(5&ndash;10 % of the Caucasian population) and results in mild elevation of the serum
unconjugated bilirubin level. This elevation and associated visible icterus is often
precipitated or exacerbated by fasting, stress, or illness. This autosomal dominant
condition results from a genetic defect in the promoter of the UGT1A1 gene
resulting in reduced transcription and moderate impairment of conjugation activity.
Other benign disorders of bilirubin metabolism include the Dubin-Johnson and
Rotor syndromes. The Dubin-Johnson syndrome, caused by genetic defects in the
canalicular MRP2 transporter, is characterized by the presence of intermittent
mild jaundice with a predominantly conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. There is also
accumulation of a dark pigment in the liver primarily in lysosomes. Rotor syndrome
resembles Dubin-Johnson syndrome except the liver pigment is lacking, and
recent evidence suggests presence of simultaneous defects in both basolateral
membrane organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.
Both conditions exhibit an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.</p>

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 Biotransformation, Elimination and Bile Acid Metabolism 309
</p>
<p>In conditions such as intra- and extrahepatic cholestasis and hepatitis, there is
failure to excrete conjugated bilirubin, which is regurgitated into the bloodstream
resulting in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Unlike unconjugated bilirubin, conju-
gated bilirubin is filtered by the kidney and excreted in the urine resulting in the dark
urine, which is characteristic of these disorders. Another serum bilirubin fraction
found in cholestatic liver disease is delta-bilirubin, which consists of conjugated
bilirubin covalently bound to albumin.
</p>
<p>There are several therapeutic modalities used to treat unconjugated hyperbiliru-
binemia, particularly in the neonate. Phototherapy, which involves exposure of
the individual to light (the blue portion of the spectrum appears to be most
effective), results in production of water-soluble photooxidation products, as well
as photoisomerization of unconjugated bilirubin with disruption of the internal
hydrogen bonding. This results in increased water solubility and elimination of
these isomers in bile and urine. This treatment is less effective in older children
and adults (such as those with Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type 1) due to the
higher body mass to surface area ratio in these individuals. In extreme cases,
exchange transfusion or plasmapheresis may be employed to rapidly reduce the
unconjugated bilirubin level. Ultimately, patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome,
type 1, require liver transplantation to correct the hepatic enzymatic defect. The
enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin may be interrupted by frequent feeding. Also,
oral administration of substances that bind bilirubin, such as agar, will interrupt
the enterohepatic circulation, but has not achieved wide use. Pharmacologic
induction of UGT1A1 may reduce serum bilirubin levels. Substances such as Sn-
protoporphyrin, which block the first enzyme involved in bilirubin production, heme
oxygenase, have shown some effectiveness, but are not widely used. Experimental
treatments currently under development include hepatocyte transplantation and
gene therapy.
</p>
<p>7 Hepatic Bile Acid Metabolism
</p>
<p>Bile formation and excretion are major functions of the liver. Bile is secreted
by the hepatocyte canaliculus, undergoes modification in the bile ducts, is
concentrated and stored in the gallbladder, and is ultimately excreted into the
duodenum. Biotransformed xenobiotics and endogenous waste products, such as
bilirubin, as well as bile acids and biliary lipids, are secreted in bile. Of the total
solutes in bile, bile acids constitute 67 %; phospholipids, 22 %; cholesterol, 4 %;
proteins, 4.5 %; and bilirubin, 0.3 %. Bile acids are amphiphilic molecules, that
is, one side of the molecule is hydrophilic and the other is hydrophobic. This
property of bile acids allows them to act as detergents in the solubilization of
the products of lipid digestion to facilitate intestinal absorption. In an aqueous
environment, bile acids are in a monomeric form until they reach their critical
micellar concentration, approximately 1-5 mM, when they aggregate as micelles
and incorporate cholesterol and phospholipid (Fig. 12.8). Once in the gut lumen,</p>

given in SI units. With typical gallbladder lipid compositions, simple bile salt and mixed bile salt-
lecithin micelles coexist in a ratio of about 1:5. The site of attachment for cholesterol molecules on
simple micelles is on the exterior (hydrophilic) surface. In mixed micelles cholesterol is solubilized
within the micelles. The unilamellar vesicles/micelles ratio depends on the bile salt and cholesterol
content of the bile, being greatest in bile with low bile salt and high and high cholesterol content
(Reproduced with permission from Carey and Duane [4])
</p>
<p>products of dietary lipid digestion, including monoacylglycerols, long-chain free
fatty acids, lysophospholipids, and fat-soluble vitamins, are incorporated to form
mixed micelles to allow these products to efficiently traverse the diffusion barrier
of the unstirred water layer and gain access to the enterocyte microvillus membrane
for absorption.
</p>
<p>In addition to their role in lipid absorption, bile acids have other functions as
well. They participate in cholesterol balance, since bile acids are synthesized from
cholesterol in a tightly regulated fashion. Although the focus of this chapter will
be the role of bile acids as regulatory molecules for their synthesis in liver and
their enterohepatic circulation, bile acids are also important signaling molecules
in the regulation of gut motility and carbohydrate metabolism. Bile acid mixed
micelles have an impact on the gut microbiome through bacteriostatic action
in the proximal intestine and induction of genes in the distal intestine that
inhibit microbial growth. Proper regulation of the composition of gallbladder bile,
including the concentration of bile acids, prevents the formation of gallstones.
</p>
<p>The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic acid and chenodeoxy-
cholic acid. They are synthesized from cholesterol as shown in Fig. 12.9. The
rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme,
cholesterol 7&rsquo;-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). A minor (10 %) pathway in humans</p>

</p>
<p>involves sterol 12&rsquo;-hydroxylase (CYP8B1, not shown) that regulates the amount
of cholic acid synthesized and thereby determines the ratio of cholic acid to
chenodeoxycholic acid, which modulates the composition and hydrophobicity of
the bile acid pool. Prior to canalicular secretion, bile acids are conjugated with
either glycine or taurine, which lowers their pKa resulting in more effective
lipid solubilization in the duodenum. Taurine conjugates predominate in infants,
and glycine conjugates are the most abundant later in life. In addition to the
primary bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, which are synthesized
by the hepatocyte, there are secondary and tertiary bile acids in the bile acid pool
(Fig. 12.9). Secondary bile acids are produced by biotransformation of primary
bile acids by intestinal bacteria. Cholic acid is converted to deoxycholic acid,
chenodeoxycholic acid is converted to both lithocholic acid and 7-oxo-lithocholic
acid. Tertiary bile acids are formed by both the liver and intestinal bacteria from
secondary bile acids. Lithocholic acid is sulfated to form sulfolithocholic acid, and
7-oxo-lithocholic acid is converted to ursodeoxycholic acid. Sulfolithocholic acid
is poorly absorbed and rapidly lost from the enterohepatic circulation.</p>

hepatic and gallbladder biles (Reproduced with permission from Carey and Duane [6])
</p>
<p>After canalicular secretion, bile undergoes modification as it passes through the
ductular system. Biliary tract epithelium is capable of absorption and secretion of
electrolytes and water by active and passive processes. The hormone secretin is
capable of stimulating secretion by bile ducts and ductules. The gallbladder concen-
trates bile five to tenfold by active absorption of cations and chloride/bicarbonate
ions coupled with passive water movement. During fasting the gallbladder stores
and concentrates bile. Post-prandially, the gallbladder contracts in response to the
release of cholecystokinin and empties its contents into the duodenum. The relative
percentages of bile acids, cholesterol, and phospholipid are normally maintained
in a relatively narrow range in bile (Fig. 12.10). If this balance is disturbed such
that the percentage of cholesterol exceeds this range, cholesterol gallstones may
form in the gallbladder, where bile is normally concentrated and there is relative
stasis. Also, in conditions characterized by increased bilirubin production, such as
hemolytic anemias, there is a propensity to form bilirubin gallstones.
</p>
<p>Bile acids undergo an enterohepatic circulation as summarized in Fig. 12.11.
After participation in lipid absorption, bile acids are actively absorbed in the distal
small intestine via an ileal high-affinity transporter. A small fraction of bile
acids may be passively absorbed in the proximal small intestine, particularly under
conditions of abnormally low intraluminal pH. The absorbed bile acids are secreted
into portal blood where they are bound to albumin and lipoproteins. There is greater
than 90 % extraction of the bile acids from the portal blood on the first pass through
the liver via a high-affinity hepatocyte membrane transporter (Fig. 12.11).
Therefore, under normal conditions, the concentration of bile acids in peripheral
blood is extremely low. These bile acids may be re-secreted into bile and make
repeated passes through the enterohepatic circulation. In adults, it is estimated that</p>

</p>
<p>the bile acid pool circulates 8&ndash;10 times per day and approximately two times with
each meal. Conservation of bile acids during this cycling is highly efficient, and
only small amounts of the bile acid pool (400&ndash;600 mg/day) are lost each day into
stool. This small amount is important, however, since this represents the only route
by which cholesterol (the precursor of bile acid synthesis) is eliminated from the
body. This loss is compensated for by an increase in hepatic synthesis.
</p>
<p>The various transporters involved in hepatocyte basolateral bile acid uptake and
canalicular secretion, modification of bile by the bile ducts, and ileal uptake of bile
acids have been identified (Fig. 12.12). Their nomenclature, function and associated
diseases caused by genetic mutations are shown in Table 12.1. At the canalicular
membrane, conjugated bile acids are secreted by BSEP. The other major compo-
nents of bile, phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, are secreted via the phospholipid</p>

located in the basolateral membrane are responsible for the uptake of bile acids (NTCP), bulky

located in the canalicular membrane are responsible for the biliary secretion of compounds
such as bile acids, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, bilirubin conjugates, and oxidized and
reduced glutathione. These transporter proteins comprise the bile salt transporter, BSEP, the phos-

<p>Fig. 12.13 Regulation of bile acid synthesis via the enterohepatic circulation. In the liver, bile
acids activate FXR, which induces SHP expression. SHP then inhibits LRH-1 and HNF-4&rsquo;
activation of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1. In the major physiological pathway, intestinal bile acids are
taken up by the ASBT and activate FXR to induce FGF19 expression. FGF19 is then carried to
the liver where it signals via a receptor tyrosine kinase, the FGFR4:&ldquo;Klotho complex, and the
MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway to inhibit CYP7A1 transcription. At the liver, FGF19 may also signal
via FGFR4:&ldquo;Klotho to stabilize SHP protein and further reduce CYP7A1 expression (Reproduced
with permission from Dawson [9])
</p>
<p>Integration and regulation of all aspects of the enterohepatic circulation
are accomplished via nuclear receptors that modulate target gene transcription
(Fig. 12.13). Ileal bile acid uptake by ASBT activates farnesoid X receptor (FXR)
that induces expression of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). Then FGF19 is
transported to the liver via the portal blood and binds to a basolateral hepatocyte
membrane receptor (FGFR4/&ldquo;Klotho complex) and down-regulates bile acid
synthesis throughMAPK/ERK1/2 signaling and stabilization of small heterodimer
protein (SHP) to suppress activation of transcription of the CYP7A1 gene by liver
receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) and hepatocyte nuclear factor-&rsquo; (HNF-4 &rsquo;). Also,
intracellular bile acids, including those extracted from portal blood, may also inhibit
synthesis via FXR activation, which induces SHP expression to down-regulate
CYP7A1. CYP8B1 is also regulated via SHP.</p>

<p>12 Biotransformation, Elimination and Bile Acid Metabolism 317
</p>
<p>The newborn infant, especially those born prematurely, have developmental
immaturity at several steps in the enterohepatic cycling of bile acids. There is
reduced hepatocyte bile acid synthesis, conjugation, uptake, and secretion.
Also, ileal uptake of bile acids is reduced and not demonstrable until 3 weeks
of age. These factors lead to a reduced bile acid pool size in the newborn. Defective
hepatic bile acid uptake and secretion lead to slightly elevated serum bile acids
and &ldquo;physiologic cholestasis of infancy.&rdquo; These deficiencies also lead to decreased
intraluminal bile acid concentrations and transient fat malabsorption in the newborn,
which is even more striking in the premature infant.
</p>
<p>7.1 Disease States Characterized by Disturbances in Bile Acid
</p>
<p>Metabolism and Enterohepatic Circulation
</p>
<p>Cholestasis
</p>
<p>Cholestasis is defined as bile excretory failure and may be the result of a variety of
disorders. Cholestasis may be broadly classified as intrahepatic (or hepatocellu-
lar) or extrahepatic (or obstructive).Examples of intrahepatic cholestasiswould
include certain types of drug-induced liver injury, inherited cholestatic syndromes
such as Alagille syndrome, and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. Gram negative
endotoxin inhibits bile acid transporters and may cause cholestasis during sepsis
or even in infants with gram negative bacterial urinary tract infections.Examples of
extrahepatic cholestasis include bile duct obstruction by gallstones, choledochal
cyst, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and biliary atresia in infants. In chronic
cholestasis there is regurgitation of bile acids and biliary lipids into the bloodstream,
which leads to several abnormalities. Accumulation of bile acids in the skin causes
severe itching or pruritis, which can be quite debilitating. As previously described,
lipoprotein metabolism is perturbed, and hyperlipidemia may be quite striking,
particularly cholesterol levels. An abnormal lipoprotein particle enriched in free
cholesterol and phospholipid called lipoprotein-X accumulates in the circulation.
Cutaneous xanthomata often result from the hyperlipidemia. Lack of adequate
intraluminal bile acid concentrations results in dietary fat malabsorption, including
fat-soluble vitamins. Jaundice and dark urine may be present due to conjugated
hyperbilirubinemia. It is interesting that in several chronic cholestatic conditions,
the serum bilirubin level may be normal or slightly elevated in the face of a markedly
elevated serum bile acid level.
</p>
<p>There is evidence that bile acids, which accumulate during cholestasis, particu-
larly hydrophobic bile acids such as lithocholic acid, may perpetuate or exacerbate
the underlying liver disease. During cholestasis associated with retention of bile
acids and conjugated bilirubin within the hepatocyte, basolateral OST-&rsquo;&ldquo; is
up-regulated via FXR to transport potentially toxic bile acids out of the cell.
Also, basolateral MRP3 and MRP4 are up-regulated by pregnane X receptor
(PXR) to transport bilirubin conjugates and bile acids, respectively, out of the
hepatocyte.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>318 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>As would be expected, genetic defects in bile acid transporters lead to clinical
cholestatic syndromes (Table 12.1). Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis
(PFIC) comprises a group of these disorders that has led to identification of some of
these transporters and better understanding of their function. Patients with PFIC are
characterized by the presence of cholestasis early in life that is progressive usually
leading to need for transplantation. Pruritis, often severe, and growth retardation are
features.
</p>
<p>Type 1 PFIC
</p>
<p>Type 1 PFIC results from mutations in the gene encoding FIC1 (ATP8B1), a
protein that translocates aminophospholipid from the outer to inner leaflets of the
canalicular membrane. Type 1 PFIC is also associated with diarrhea thought to
be due to the expression of defective FIC1 in the small intestine. This type of
PFIC was formerly known as Byler disease after the Amish kindred in whom
it was first described. Mutations in ATP8B1 also may result in a much milder
phenotype, benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) characterized by
recurrent episodes of mild to severe cholestasis with intervening asymptomatic
periods.
</p>
<p>Type 2 PFIC
</p>
<p>Type 2 PFIC is due to mutations in the bile salt export pump, BSEP (ABCB11),
and is similar to type 1, but with more rapid progression to need for transplantation.
</p>
<p>Type 3 PFIC
</p>
<p>Type 3 PFIC is caused by mutations in the gene for MDR3 (ABCB4), a
canalicular phospholipid flippase responsible for secretion of phospholipid into bile.
The resultant abnormal bile devoid of phospholipid permits bile acids to cause injury
to hepatocytes and cholangiocytes resulting in cholestasis. Progression may be
variable depending on the specific mutation, although chronic cholestasis, marked
fibrosis and liver failure usually result. Mutations in ABCB4 may also be related to
intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and gallstone formation. A subset of patients
with CFTR mutations and cystic fibrosis also develop a form of liver disease called
focal biliary cirrhosis, and some mutations in this gene may be responsible for
the development of primary sclerosing cholangitis in the absence of the classic
phenotype of cystic fibrosis.</p>

<p>12 Biotransformation, Elimination and Bile Acid Metabolism 319
</p>
<p>7.2 Treatment of Cholestasis due to Bile Transporter Mutations
</p>
<p>Patients with cholestasis due to bile transporter mutations represent challenges to
management of their disease. Oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid, a
non-toxic, water-soluble bile acid, may result in improvement through its ability
to increase bile flow and displace toxic bile acids in the bile acid pool. This bile acid
also has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. It is a minor tertiary bile
acid in humans, but is the major bile acid in bears; thus the name. Another approach
is to orally administer a bile acid binding resin, such as cholestyramine, or
perform a surgical external biliary diversion. Both of these measures chronically
eliminate bile acids from the body and reduce the size of the bile acid pool.
However, response to both of these treatments is variable, and compliance with
bile acid sequestrants is often poor and biliary diversion may be associated with
complications.
</p>
<p>Ileal Dysfunction or Resection
</p>
<p>Individuals with inflammatory disease of the ileum, such as Crohn&rsquo;s disease,
or an ileal resection, as in infants requiring resection secondary to necrotizing
enterocolitis, have defective ileal bile acid uptake and bile acid malabsorption.
Bile acids may enter the colon and cause a secretory diarrhea mediated by a
cAMP-dependent mechanism. With increased fecal loss of bile acids, there is
a compensatory increase in bile acid synthesis, and the bile acid pool size is
maintained. These patients may be treated with oral administration of bile acid
binding resins, which bind the malabsorbed bile acids to allow elimination in stool
and prevent the associated diarrhea. If the inflammatory process is very severe or the
amount of resected ileum is extensive, the bile acid loss may exceed the capacity of
the liver to increase synthesis to compensate for the loss. In this situation there is a
reduction is the bile acid pool size and resultant reduction in the intraluminal bile
acid concentration, often to below the critical micellar concentration. This results in
malabsorption of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins.
</p>
<p>Intestinal Blind Loop Syndrome
</p>
<p>In conditions that result in stasis of proximal intestinal contents such as blind
loop syndrome, bacterial overgrowth may occur resulting in deconjugation of
bile acids by primarily anaerobic bacteria. Unconjugated bile acids are readily
passively absorbed leading to a deficient intraluminal bile acid concentration and
fat malabsorption. These unconjugated bile acids may also exert a toxic effect
on the intestinal mucosa, leading to exacerbation of malabsorption and diarrhea.
Oral administration of broad-spectrum non-absorbable antibiotics may result
in clinical improvement.</p>

<p>Clinical Correlations
</p>
<p>Case Study 1
</p>
<p>A 22-year-old male comes to your office with the complaint of noticing &ldquo;yellow
eyes&rdquo; intermittently throughout his life, generally associated with an acute febrile
illness with decreased appetite and food intake. Apparently, blood tests had been
performed in childhood, and his parents had been told that he had &ldquo;mild hepatitis&rdquo;,
since the only abnormality reported was an elevated bilirubin. He otherwise has
been healthy with normal growth and development and no other complaints. There
is no history of blood exposure or exposure to anyone with hepatitis. Family
history is significant for similar symptoms in his father who was killed in a traffic
accident at age 32 years. The present problem prompting a visit to you is the
patient&rsquo;s inability to obtain health insurance coverage for a pre-existing &ldquo;recurrent
hepatitis&rdquo;. The physical examination is normal. No jaundice is noted. There is no
hepatosplenomegalyor ascites. There are no findings to suggest chronic liver disease
or cirrhosis.
</p>
<p>Laboratory studies: Hematocrit 46 %; hemoglobin 15.1 g/dL; reticulocyte count
1.1 % (0.8&ndash;2.5); white blood cell count 7,900 cells/mm3 (4,500&ndash;11,000); 220,
000 platelets/mm3 (150,000&ndash;350,000); prothrombin time 12.2 s (control 12.4 s);
albumin 4.9 g/dL (3.7&ndash;5.6); total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL (0.1&ndash;1.0); direct bilirubin
0.2 mg/dL (0&ndash;0.2); ALT 22 IU/L (10&ndash;30), AST 24 IU/L (15&ndash;30); GGTP 21 IU/L
(0&ndash;25); alkaline phosphatase 61 IU/L (30&ndash;100); urinalysis is negative for bilirubin
and shows normal urobilinogen.
</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. What is this patient&rsquo;s most likely diagnosis?
Answer: The presence of a non-hemolytic (normal Hgb, reticulocyte count,
and urine urobilinogen) unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in an adult, which
is exaggerated with the occurrence of an acute illness, would strongly suggest
the diagnosis of the Gilbert syndrome. This is especially true with the positive
family history, since there appears to be autosomal dominant inheritance.
</p>
<p>2. Why is the patient not icteric now?
Answer: Even though individuals with the Gilbert syndrome have an exaggera-
tion of their indirect hyperbilirubinemiawith acute illness or fasting, the baseline
level is generally above normal, as in this individual. However, adults do not
generally demonstrate visible jaundice until the serum bilirubin level reaches
2.0 mg/dL. Fasting or illness is thought to elevate the bilirubin level further by
reducing the availability of glucose for formation of UDP-glucuronic acid by
UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, thereby reducing bilirubin conjugation. However,
the precise mechanism is not known.
</p>
<p>3. How would you confirm the diagnosis?
Answer: The Gilbert syndrome is generally considered a diagnosis of exclusion
with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in an otherwise healthy individual
without evidence of hemolysis or structural liver disease. A past approach has</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 Biotransformation, Elimination and Bile Acid Metabolism 321
</p>
<p>involved measuring bilirubin levels in the parents after a 48-h fast to uncover
the affected parent. However, this approach has not been shown to be reliable.
In this case, the presumably affected parent is deceased. In most situations, the
present evaluation would be adequate. However, the measurement of the ratio of
monoglucuronide to diglucuronide bilirubin conjugates in duodenal bile may be
confirmatory if an increased ratio of monoconjugates to diconjugates is found.
This same finding is also present in the Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type II. Genetic
testing is also available for the Gilbert syndrome mutation.
</p>
<p>4. How would you counsel this patient?
Answer: He should be reassured that the Gilbert syndrome is a completely
benign disorder and should not affect his health or activity in any way.
</p>
<p>Case Study 2
</p>
<p>A 28-year-old female has a history of Crohn&rsquo;s disease involving the terminal ileum
for the past 8 years. Six months ago she underwent resection of an unknown
length of her terminal ileum secondary to intractable inflammation and enterocolic
fistula formation. Her recovery from surgery was uneventful. She initially had an
ileostomy, which was later reconnected. She has continued to have watery diarrhea
with 6&ndash;7 large watery stools per day. No mucus or blood has been noted in the
stool. Otherwise, she has been afebrile and has had no other symptoms. A contrast
radiographic study of the area of the anastomosis shows no evidence of recurrent
disease. A colonoscopy with ileoscopy also shows normal mucosa without evidence
of recurrent Crohn&rsquo;s disease which is confirmed by biopsies. Physical examination
is unremarkable except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars.
</p>
<p>Laboratory studies: Hematocrit 30 %; hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL (RBC indices
are macrocytic); reticulocyte count 0.4 % (0.8&ndash;2.5); white blood cell count
5,400 cells/mm3 (4,500&ndash;11,000); 233, 000 platelets/mm3 (150,000&ndash;350,000);
erythrocyte sedimentation rate 4 mm/h (0&ndash;20); albumin 4.2 g/dL (3.7&ndash;5.6); serum
iron 150 �g/dL (50&ndash;170); serum folate 2.2.ng/L (1.8&ndash;9.0); serum vitamin B12
19 pg/mL (30&ndash;785); stool negative for white blood cells, occult blood, Giardia-
specific antigen, Clostridium difficile toxin; stool culture negative for enteric
pathogens.
</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. What is the most likely cause of the diarrhea and how would you confirm it?
Answer: A recurrence of Crohn&rsquo;s disease proximal to the surgical anastomosis
is ruled out by radiographic studies and endoscopy with biopsy. Additionally,
the ESR and serum albumin are normal. Stool studies and cultures are negative
and make an infectious etiology unlikely. The fact that the patient is vitamin B12-
deficient with associated megaloblastic anemia suggests that a significant amount
of ileum, the site of absorption of this vitamin, was resected. Therefore, deficient
ileal absorption of bile acids with a resulting colonic secretory diarrhea is a strong
possibility. A therapeutic trial of oral cholestyramine (a bile acid binding resin)
is instituted and results in resolution of the diarrhea.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>322 D.D. Black
</p>
<p>2. What is another complication of deficient ileal absorption of bile acids?
Answer: If the liver is unable to compensate for the chronic loss of bile
acids from the bile acid pool by increased synthesis, bile acid deficiency will
result. This deficiency can result in a luminal bile acid concentration below
the critical micellar concentration with resultant fat and fat-soluble vitamin
malabsorption.
</p>
<p>Case Study 3
</p>
<p>A 16-year-old white female is brought to the emergency room after admitting
to her parents that she attempted suicide by ingesting an unknown number of
acetaminophen tablets approximately 6 h ago. The patient is otherwise healthy, but
does have a past history of depression and has been seeing a psychologist. Her
physical examination is unremarkable. She is afebrile with normal vital signs. She
is anicteric and in no distress. She is alert and oriented. Her abdomen is soft and
non-distended. Her liver span is 10 cm by percussion without splenomegaly. Her
neurological examination is normal without asterixis.
</p>
<p>Laboratory studies: Hematocrit 38 %; hemoglobin 18.1 g/dL; white blood cell
count 9,900 cells/mm3 (4,500&ndash;11,000); 305, 000 platelets/mm3 (150,000&ndash;350,000);
prothrombin time 11.0 s (control 12.4 s); albumin 4.6 g/dL (3.7&ndash;5.6); total bilirubin
0.8 mg/dL (0.1&ndash;1.0); direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dL (0&ndash;0.2); ALT 96 IU/L (10&ndash;30),
AST 110 IU/L (15&ndash;30); GGTP 21 IU/L (6&ndash;29); alkaline phosphatase 230 IU/L
(61&ndash;264); urinalysis is negative for bilirubin and shows normal urobilinogen;
toxicology screen positive for fluoxetine, which the patient takes for depression,
and acetaminophen.
</p>
<p>Questions:
</p>
<p>1. What is the next step?
Answer: An acetaminophen level is measured and is 200 �g/mL 8 h post esti-
mated ingestion. The Rumack-Matthew nomogram is consulted to determine
the risk for significant hepatotoxicity and need for treatment based on serum
level and time post-ingestion. The patient&rsquo;s level is in the range for toxicity,
and treatment is indicated. The time frame for effective gastric lavage and
administration of activated charcoal is past. N-acetylcysteine is administered
by nasogastric tube per protocol that includes a loading dose and every 4 h
dosing based on body mass for a total of 72 h. The patient is admitted with
an intravenous line for hydration, and is closely monitored with vital sign and
neurological checks, as well as serial laboratory testing.
</p>
<p>2. What is the expected clinical course?
Answer: The clinical course of acetaminophen intoxication may be divided into
four phases:
</p>
<p>Phase 1, 30 min to 24 h after ingestion, during which there may be minimal or
no symptoms and subclinical rise in transaminases.
</p>
<p>Phase 2, 18-72 h post-ingestion, during which patients may have nausea and
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, and decreased urine output.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>12 Biotransformation, Elimination and Bile Acid Metabolism 323
</p>
<p>Phase 3, hepatic phase, 72-96 h post-ingestion, is associated with continued
nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and tender liver. Hepatic necrosis
may become obvious with markedly elevated transaminases, jaundice, coagu-
lopathy, hypoglycemia and hepatic encephalopathy.Acute renal failuremay
occur, followed by death from multiorgan failure. Transplantation should
be considered.
</p>
<p>Phase 4, recovery phase, 4 days to 3 weeks post-ingestion, and patients
who survive usually have complete resolution of symptoms and hepatic
recovery.
</p>
<p>In the case of this patient, her liver tests peaked at between 72 and 96 h post
ingestion with AST 12,000 IU/L and ALT 10,700 IU/L, bilirubin total 3.7 mg/dL,
direct 2.9 mg/dL, prothrombin time 15.5 s, and normal blood ammonia level. The
patient experienced nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, but remained alert
with no signs of hepatic encephalopathy. She subsequently made an uneventful
recovery.
</p>
<p>3. To what do you attribute the patient&rsquo;s recovery?
Answer: The features of this case that contributed to full recovery included
a young, otherwise healthy patient, a single acute ingestion, and rapid
institution of N-acetylcysteine therapy to restore hepatic glutathione levels to
deplete toxic NAPQI levels. The acetaminophen level and Rumack-Matthew
nomogram are useful in guiding therapy, but are not helpful if there is multiple
chronic dosing or the time of ingestion is unknown. Studies of the use other
markers for potential hepatotoxicity, such as serum levels of the degradation
products of acetaminophen protein adducts, are ongoing and may prove useful
for clinical management.
